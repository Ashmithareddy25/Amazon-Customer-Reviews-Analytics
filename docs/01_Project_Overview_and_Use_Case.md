# Amazon Customer Reviews Analytics
## Project Overview and Practical Use Case

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **complete end-to-end analytics pipeline** for large-scale Amazon customer reviews using **Big Data processing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning**. The goal is to convert raw, unstructured review text into **actionable insights** that support product evaluation, customer satisfaction analysis, and business decision-making.

Unlike basic exploratory analysis, this project integrates:
- Scalable data processing using Apache Spark
- Feature engineering and machine learning models
- Model evaluation with quantitative metrics
- An interactive analytics dashboard

## 🧩 Business Motivation
Customer reviews are one of the most influential factors in e-commerce purchasing decisions. However, the sheer volume and unstructured nature of review data make manual analysis infeasible.

This project provides an automated solution to:
- Understand customer sentiment at scale
- Predict star ratings directly from review text
- Discover recurring themes and product issues
- Enable interactive exploration of trends and insights

## 🎯 Practical Use Case
This system can be used by:
- **Product Managers** to identify customer pain points
- **Marketing Teams** to understand perception trends
- **Data Analysts** to evaluate product performance
- **E-commerce Platforms** to rank and assess product worthiness
