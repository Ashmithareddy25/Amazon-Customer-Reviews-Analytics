# Amazon Customer Reviews Analytics – Project Overview and Use Case

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end analytics pipeline to analyze Amazon customer reviews using Big Data technologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning. The system processes large-scale unstructured review data to extract sentiment, predict product ratings, identify common discussion topics, and present insights through an interactive analytics dashboard.

The project demonstrates how raw, unstructured e-commerce data can be transformed into structured, actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## Practical Use Case
Customer reviews significantly influence purchasing decisions on e-commerce platforms. However, manually analyzing millions of reviews is impractical. This project addresses this challenge by enabling:

- Automated sentiment analysis of customer feedback
- Prediction of product ratings from review text
- Identification of recurring themes and customer pain points
- Visualization of insights for analysts and stakeholders

This solution is applicable to e-commerce companies, product managers, and data analysts seeking scalable customer feedback analysis.

## Key Objectives
- Build a scalable batch-processing analytics pipeline using Apache Spark
- Apply NLP techniques to unstructured text data
- Train machine learning models for sentiment classification and rating prediction
- Deliver insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard
