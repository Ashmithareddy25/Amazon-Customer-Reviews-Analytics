B0041KKYBK|5.0|This documentary should be required viewing for all Senators, Congressmen and every voter who is concerned about the direction our country is headed economically.  \\"Inside Job\\" carefully deconstructs the collapse of our financial system and the impact on the economy not just of America, but of the world.  More than just a regurgitation of the facts, \\"Inside Job\\" looks at the conduct of the principal players both in the corporate and political world, and reveals both staggering incompetence and criminal malfeasance.  Absolutely a MUST SEE movie!
0316017922|5.0|A very good read, lots of new stuff to think about.  A newer look about being in the right place at the right time.  Some good observations about the authors roots that cover my Irish ancestry as well.  I bought a few more copies to send to my kids.

B004KA9MQO|3.0|Jennifer Hudson is one of the most  talented entertainers of my generation. She is a believable and strong actress and an outstanding and phenomenal singer. Her voice is one of the strongest you will ever hear and her voice has a whole lot of personality. She has an unmistakable alto.<br /><br />\\"I Remember Me\\" is her second musical offering and I enjoyed it. Is it among my favorites of albums released in 2011? Probably not, but it's a good album.  It contains midtemp tracks more so than anything else, and Hudson shines on each and every song. The title track is a nice midtempo about how she changed throughout her life.  There's a line in the song that says, \\"What you are is what you are.\\" She sounds crisp and poised on this song. She remade Nina Simone's \\"Feeling Good\\" and it's another highlight on the album. You know what? Jennifer should stop re-making people's songs because she simply does a better job than them! You all remember how mad she made Jennifer Holiday....\\"Still Here\\" must be a dedication to her mother and the other family members she lost because she says, \\"You're still here..and we'll never be apart...you're still here in my heart.\\" What a heartfelt track this is. She is emotional while singing it, that's understandable and obvious.<br /><br />Hudson is something special. I hope she continues to entertain for as long as she can because, to me, she will never get old  for she is extremely talented. I really mean that.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Don't Look Down\\"<br />2. \\"Where You At\\"<br />3. \\"Believe\\"<br />4. \\"I Remember Me\\"<br />5. No One Gonna Love You\\"
B004OYCUWE|2.0|Just wondering if anyone else is having this problem? My first copy skipped a lot on side two. Amazon just sent me a replacement disc and this one skips as well. My player and needle are fine and working well on other discs, including other 180 gram vinyl. I just wanted to see if this is a common issue from others who have purchased this disc. It's a bummer because the new remastering sounds terrific otherwise. It's the best I've ever heard Dirty Mind sound.

B002ZG976U|5.0|I had been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD and was not disapointed. I love this movie.  It was a little bit predictable, but the acting/music was great.  I never thought that I would see Kristen bell like that (I alway though that she had a good girl image, but either way she did a great job).  Christina Aguilera has an awesome voice and I'm plesantly surprised with her actitng ability.  Cher is Cher, she's always good at whatever she does.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|I love Georgette Heyer books, and Venetia is my favorite one.  I've been a little disapointed that it wasn't available on my Kindle till now ... but it's here at last!    Venetia is a great heroine ... she's sensible and funny. Damerel is a \\"rake with a heart of gold\\" and is the perfect match for her.  There's a lot of chemistry between them.      I also like that this book takes place in the country and in London, so that we get a taste of Regency England from both sides.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|first, this series is filmed in Nova Scotia (Eastern Canada), and the town setting is in Haven, Maine, in a small, quaint, fishing village.  The town itself is a \\"character\\" in the series, because the \\"troubles\\" (supernatural bizarre occurances) are due to the town itself, and some old curse.  The cinematography of the area is very beautiful (makes you want to pack your bags and move there).<br /><br />Now, moving on...the characters are well-written.  Emily Rose plays a FBI agent who comes to Haven to investigate a case and chooses to stay there indefinitely to pursue the possibility that her mother may have disappered there years earlier.<br /><br />Another main character is the chief of police, who often works together with the FBI agent in trying to solve these bizarre cases- so there is a Mulder-Scully dynamic (X-Files) between them.<br /><br />* one of the best shows currently on syfy- recommended viewing *
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I saw the comment on this in Wicked Scribes and since I had it already but hadn't started reading it, I decided to give it a try.     This was a wonderful book! Pia and Dragos were wonderful. It was funny, exciting, thrilling and the romance was off the hook!    I liked the writing, it wasn't too sappy and I just couldn't wait to see what kind of Wyr Pia was. Dragos was a wonderful hero and I loved that Pia wasn't some shrinking violet who stood in the corner while the big strong man protected. The other characters are great and their stories should be fantastic.     I can't wait for the next book!

I am on Chapter 29 of Something Blue, let me rephrase that, I have suffered through 29 chapters and cannot read another page. This is completely unrealistic and frustrating. Let's have the main character, a complete self-absorbed spoiled brat, treat people like crap make a list of how to be a better person. Then miraculously do a one-eighty but really when it comes down to it is still only changing for a dude.  I'm done. Don't waste your time.

B002N5N4M6|2.0|This season was dramatically less enjoyable for us. I am surprised the other reviewers are not mentioning that the new characters did not add new angles to the story... instead, they simply pushed out some of the other characters more and expanded the story cast so much that the core four people simply are not together in one scene nearly as much as the earlier seasons. When they are together, the show rocks. It seems as though they took the best part of the show and cast it aside.

Then, in a blink, she finds herself watching as her own damaged body is taken from the wreck...   A sophisticated, layered, and heartachingly beautiful story about the power of family and friends, the choices we all make--and the ultimate choice Mia commands.\\"     My Review: An amazing and emotional journey! Gayle Forman brings you a long and shoves you into Mia's memories and decision. You can't help but be drug into the mix of emotions Mia feels and she struggles with a decision to stay or to go with her family. It makes you wonder what you would do? Could you stay if you knew you had lost so much and could possibly loose more? Or would you fight for what small hope there could be?

0525422943|5.0|Wow, a beautiful follow up to If I Stay! I love that it continues the story but from a different point of view. The emotions we followed Adam through are extreme, you feel his anguish, his heartbreak, hope and confussion. I can almost hear the songs he writes as I read the book. Gayle Forman presents us with realistic takes on stardom and life, we can't have some dreams without sacrificing others, we can have everything without feeling pain, its up to us what pain we feel and what we choose to achieve.
B003TEFTDM|4.0|Meet Ben Richards.  Ben lives in the United States which has gone all totalitarian in the year 2025.  His life sucks.  Unemployed.  Daughter sick.  Wife turning tricks.  So Ben wants to be on one of the reality shows run by the Games Network, a government-backed station.  The problem is that these are violent games in which participants often die.    Lucky Ben!  He gets to be on the best show--the running man.  Simple rules.  Each hour he stays alive earns him money.  Hunters are sent after him.  Prizes are offered to the public to help catch him.  The game ends in 30 days or when he dies, whichever comes first.     This is the first King's book I like.  I even like Ben Richards.  A good man in desperate situation.  He wants to work.  He cares for his daughter and his wife.  He is brave but not a superhuman showoff.  The book is an easy and fun read.  It is not as exciting as \\"Hunger Games\\" but the writing is better here, the story better told.    Futuristic does not seem to be King's thing.  (OK to be fair the book was released in 1982 and was banged out in under a week.)  I mean, every reference is just so dated.  People in 2025 live the same way as in the 1980's except that they have funky names for things (newsie for newspaper, Free-Vee for T.V., etc).  The network relies on the Postal Service to get video clips back from Ben.  At one point Ben needs quarters to use a pay phone!      **SPOILER** I did not like the ending.  I was rooting for Ben and would be much happier if King goes with rebels bringing down the regime.  There is more going for that than in \\"Catching Fire\\".  **END SPOILER**
B000SLP4SE|1.0|Hunter wrote a great book; you can read all of it and go back into the middle and read again to the end, and not sleep, it's that good.  This movie is so bad.  The first twenty minutes are mostly Mark Wahlberg breathing heavily.  Some books should make great movies.  This isn't it.  This one reminds me of \\"The Firm\\", which is a great book, but the !@#$% Direector couldn't take his camera off Cruise's beautiful face.  I think this time the Director, Fuqua, couldn't shake off Wahlberg's lungs...whatever.  Lots of noise, not much else.  Don't waste your time and your money.

B003CR9BYE|2.0|In spite of negative reviews, I bought this CD, at least for the great cover picture. Yes, all the critical notes are true, and I won't replicate them. My own impression is like the fine artwork and negligent sound remastering were performed on different planets with no connection, no central management and no general concept. That is strange for the label specializing in serious hi-end recordings.    So, if you wish to have the complete Sinatra-Jobim recording and you don't care much for quality of the sound, if you don't care if it's stereo or mono, this compilation will hardly disappoint you. But if you want to listen to real stereo hi-fi, with clear and detailed sound, I would recommend (just as I followed someone's advice here at Amazon) combining previously released and still available on CD \\"Frank Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim\\" (originally recorded in 1967), with the first seven tracks of \\"Sinatra and Company\\" (the tracks were recorded in 1969 and issued in 1971). Then you will have a great CDR compilation with 17 original Sinatra-Jobim stereo tracks. Why only 17 and not all 20? As Stan \\"Underwood\\" Cornyn wrote in his linear notes to this \\"Complete Reprise Recordings\\", \\"The Song of the Sabia\\", \\"Bonita\\", and even the all time hit \\"Desafinado\\" were rejected by Sinatra himself. He just said one word: \\"off\\". And then a short phone call to Warner-Reprise: \\"Kill the album\\". That's why the second Sinatra-Jobim album was never released after the first 3500 tape copies were destroyed. \\"Sinatra did never ever want to be heard struggling at the mike\\", writes Stan Cornyn. Only in 1971 Reprise issued that \\"Sinatra and Company\\" with Side 2 fleshed out with 7 songs that can only be interesting in terms of history. I believe that since Sinatra didn't want anything he did to be published, it should not have been published. Funny, but before I read the linear notes, I listened to the disc and didn't like exactly those three. So, in my opinion, the 17 tracks are quiteenough.     Although I already had the first Sinatra-Jobim album, I don't regret spending $15 on this CD, and then additional $10 on \\"Sinatra and Company\\". Now I have not only a great 17-tracks Sinatra-Jobim CDR compilation, but a jewel case for it with that fine cover picture and, at last, a 20 pages booklet with a very interesting story inside about how it all was done.
1439148953|5.0|If you're going to read this book, be advised that the beginning is very slow. Toibin takes his time describing the slightest detail in tedious way. Everything from the way Rose walks to the manner in which Eilis read her letters sent from her family. To some, this might become boring, but once you're half-way into the book, you truly begin to appreciate all of those details because they all add up to the Eilis's transformation. Not only that, but you get a real sense of every character. The ending would not have caused such a deep feeling had I not known (and ultimately felt) all those details.  Colm Toibin is an amazing writer and this is a must-read. A review from The Times U.K. states that, \\"Reading Toibin is like watching an artist paint one small stroke after another until suddenly the finished picture emerges to shattering effect...\\" This, I believe, sums of the experience of reading this novel.

031603441X|5.0|Life is the story of Keith Richards, co-founder and guitarist with the Rolling Stones ~ a rock band popular from the late 1960's to the early 2000's. The book devotes itself to the issue of why the band was successful riding a wave of accomplishments while other groups were stumbling or spinning their wheels without getting much traction. In other words, many of us lack the commitment to fulfill our dreams or we fall into the trap of being indifferent. Being impassive can result in desolation, stagnation, and creative barrenness.<br /><br />Some performers like Keith Richards were fortunate to be born with the gift of a creative imagination, and keen sense of adventure. Even luckier, he was blessed with a good sense of wanderlust which enabled him to explore interesting destinations in a variety of countries. This exposed him to different forms of musical expression, influenced his writing and expanded his repertoire. He learned many technical skills from blues musicians in America. They demonstrated different ways of tuning, showed him other types of strings and introduced him to new guitar sounds. Life is one of those special journeys for the very privileged, who want to know what it felt like to be with Keith Richards and his band, The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />Keith offers his readers a great deal of striking revelations rolled into an entertaining assortment of recollections. His sharp-humored charm will at times make you laugh and other times cry, however, in the end readers will be greatly satisfied with Richard's strong sense of honesty and down-to-earth retrospection.<br /><br />Keith goes into fascinating detail pertaining to his creative process. I had no idea he was responsible for so many of my favorite Rolling Stones songs. As a matter of fact, after he explained the basis for writing a particular tune, I would immediately access youtube to hear it performed. That added much richness to the story.<br /><br />He discusses other topics such as communication with other band members, musicians he met along the way, how to listen and work with discipline, band hierarchy and management, empathy for his audience, band team work, combating complacency, and the thrill of performance.<br /><br />His natural human qualities proved to be useful: he was motivated to play the music he loved, unselfish towards band mates, appreciative of others, praised his contemporaries, and was highly involved in all aspects of operating a world-class rock band.<br /><br />Exploring his inner thoughts and outer persona, Keith reflects on his past and present life touching on various aspects of the human condition: love, death, children, illness, divorce, aging, drugs, fear, recovery, success, loss, father and son relationships and a host of other familiar topics.<br /><br />Because the author is a person with flexibility, patience, initiative, and humility, I was able to assess the impact of some of Keith's perceptions on my own life, career and relationships.<br /><br />Life is certainly a lively and challenging recollection that no doubt will provide its readers with much entertaining insights about life as a rock star. The information is presented in a way that is user friendly. The breadth of the musings is quite remarkable as they are conveyed in a form that permits readers to thoroughly savor and digest.<br /><br />Many autobiography books will omit or gloss over details on important past mistakes, scandals or failures. Keith was open, forthright and honest and this is what makes his book engaging. It will no doubt appeal to the millions of rock fans who can now more fully appreciate his contributions to modern culture.<br /><br />Reviewed by: C.J. Good, Authors he met along the way, how to listen and work with discipline, band hierarchy and management, empathy for his audience, band team work, combating complacency, and the thrill of performance.

B003D5X3VM|5.0|Mr. Porter's voice is truly amazing.  I love this cd and wish I would have found it sooner.  I first heard his voice on WBGO radio.  He is soulful, fluid and a joy to listen too.  The arrangements are stellar and the muscians are amazing.  Yes, it is mostly jazz but more importantly it's just GREAT music.  If you buy this cd, you will not be sorry.  He is a very gifted singer and songwriter.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|Zack Snyder is very passionate about geek culture. That's very obvious from his cinematic body of work, (Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen). Sucker Punch, Snyder's fifth effort as director - he also helmed the 2010 animated film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole - is a film that oozes that very passion. It contains everything that fanboys crave and is likely to have limited appeal outside of the ComicCon set. Sucker Punch tells the story of \\"Babydoll\\", a young girl who is consigned to a mental hospital against her will by her stepfather. While there, she re-imagines the institution as a cabaret dance club and conspires to escape with several other girls. Their attempts at escape become outlandish fantasy-action sequences in which Babydoll and the other girls are gun and sword wielding heroines.     Sucker Punch is like a dream that a geek would have after a lengthy binge on video games, comic books and anime. It is a fantastical melange of action, science fiction and fantasy elements. You get the feeling that Snyder wrote the story by hanging out with friends and throwing out ideas. \\"Wouldn't it be cool if she fought a 15-foot samurai with a machine gun??\\" Pretty much any far-out idea that comes into Snyder's head turns up in the flick. Through the course of Sucker Punch's 110 minutes the audience bears witness to (in addition to the aforementioned fifteen-foot samurai) mechanical German soldiers and WWII dirigibles, a fire-breathing dragon and robots programmed with sick martial arts skills. Some of these ideas feel half-baked and, indeed, I did have that feeling about the movie as a whole; that Sucker Punch was a series of very cool scenes in search of a coherent story. The framing \\"real world\\" story of a girl in a mental hospital couldn't possibly compete with robots and giant samurai. The film does tend to bog down a bit in the dramatic scenes of the girls, Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung chit-chatting and discussing their plans.     The movie is very well made. Visually, it's absolutely incredible. I literally cannot wait to pop in the Sucker Punch blu-ray and see this baby in 1080p. It has a video game look and feel which I'm sure where intended by Snyder. The colors are desaturated and the flesh tones tend to look very computer generated. Emily Browning's Babydoll in particular looks like she has just hopped out of a Final Fantasy game. The action sequences are amazing to look act and lots of fun, if a little too chaotic. Snyder's love for slow-motion fight scenes is once again on display here. Acting is about what you would expect for an action-fantasy film. Emily Browning, the human star of the movie, speaks very little and wears the same expression on her face as if she's about to burst into tears for the entire movie. Carla Gugino does some nice work as the madam/dance instructor/whatever and Oscar Isaac is an appropriately slimy villain.    I do get the sense that there is more here than meets the eye. I do not think that Zack Snyder merely intended this film to be an empty excuse for cool action scenes, but on a single viewing any profound messages or themes eluded me. I'm not sure what to make about the opening and closing   gobbledygook voice-over about angels. However, I will be seeing Sucker Punch again and I will pay closer attention to the subtleties of this story in hopes to grasp any such profundity. Despite some misgivings, I had a good time with Sucker Punch and look forward to a second viewing. Warner Bros will be releasing an extended cut on blu-ray which I will view and possibly amend this review accordingly. Clearly this movie is not for everybody. Critical reviews have been understandably very mixed. As I said earlier, the movie is not likely to find an audience outside of the comics and video game crowd. Zack Snyder is trying hard to do something bold and outside the box and I give him much credit for that. Sucker Punch may not totally succeed as a movie, but at least it tries! If nothing else, it's a fascinating and enjoyable failure.
1439102724|2.0|I usually like Ms. Picoult's books, but this one was not well-written. Zoe goes through some tremendous life changes in a very short time, but they're handled almost perfunctorily by the author, including the twist at the end. I get the ethical dilemma at the center, but usually Ms. Picoult writes real characters and conflicts, and this one just doesn't hold together. Too many people change 180 degrees too quickly, and some issues are left undiscussed, and, well, it just wasn't well-written.
B001AHM2C6|5.0|Greetings from an Australian and a film soundtrack fan. Taking as my starting point how wonderful the themes composed were woven into the movie, I didn't need much encouragement to purchase this soundtrack. Especially the main haunting theme that to me signifies a hero with great abilities and yet there is a sadness to what he witnesses and has to confront. But it is a majestic theme most importantly. It is in my experience, and I've been collecting soundtracks for 25 years, quite unusual for two major film composers to unite for the one film score. I think they pull it off beautifully - it does not intrude into the film and yet is a cinematic achievement in its own right. A lot of the music is incidental music. Bit I heartily recommend purchasing the original soundtrack for the Main Theme alone. As an Australian fan, with Heath Ledger's passing, it would have been great to have extracts from his dialogue as The Joker on the soundtrack, as is done quite often. I thought this was a missed opportunity to remember one of the great performances in cinematic history.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about before I watched it, and i was pleasantly surprised. I assumed i'd be watching a movie about an incredible speech that lifted england up somehow, instead it was literally about King George the VI's speech impediment. If i would have known that ahead of time, i probably wouldn't have been inclined to watch it, but it turned out to be really good. It made me laugh several times and you can't help but smile as you're watching it for certain parts. The acting was great, and overall i recommended it to all my friends. I'm the type of person who will only watch a movie once, rarely do i re-watch movies. this is a movie i'd probably rent, enjoy, then return. highly recommend you see at least once.
0345522478|5.0|I must say that I truly enjoyed this book very much.  First, I should make it quite clear that I'm not that big of a reader.  I don't read too often because it often takes me quite awhile to read and don't find too much time for it.  However, I loved this book and raced through it (at least as far as racing through a book could be for me) in about 5 or 6 days.  I always wanted to go back and read some more.  It was hilarious and witty.  The characters are fun and original and Oberon always gave me a chuckle.    Simply said, I loved this book and I can hardly wait for the next installment.  I'm glad I only have to wait a month for it.  Definitely add this to your buy list.

B0002BO05S|4.0|After not finding any Easter Season viewing this year on cable i.e. Jesus of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told, The Robe etc. I decided to add them to my library. I saw The Greatest Story Ever Told many years ago when it aired regularly. I've always liked it but this time after not seeing it through for many years I was quite surprised at the depth of the performances which are really quite remarkable. Max Von Sydow is amazing. There have been quibles about so many \\"stars\\" thrown into the movie as cameos. Who doesn't want to see the likes of Claude Rains, Charlton Heston, Telly Savalas, Sal Mineo, Jose Ferrer and Van Heflin just to name a few. While it is true that by todays action movie instant gratification standards it is a bit slow moving, it is well worth the savoring of the acting. The Lazarus scene is amazing. Max portrays the real human side of Christ and is stung by the harsh reprimand of not coming earlier to save his friends life. Van Heflin's witnessing of the event explains why the people who witnessed these miracles became apostles and martyrs. Needless to say I was very satisified with this movie and would highly recommend it.

B004UID2LC|1.0|Cannot download and/or install app on Nook Color or Nexux S. Don't know if this is because there is no actual phone hardware or if it is simply because the phone is identified as a tablet and not a phone. Either way it sucks because a tablet is a great way to watch videos.  The app could be great for all I know...but then again, I guess I'll never know.

0793518326|4.0|This is a great book to reference and learn from. Keep in mind however that all of the songs are in full score, so you will need to be doing a lot of page turning when you first learn one of the tunes. This is a very small price to pay for an excellent book.
0545265355|5.0|I was told before I started reading to make sure I had all three.  They ended in cliffhangers and were so good that you would be mad if you didn't have the next book easily accessible- they were 100% correct!  Prepare to have these books take over your life while reading them so I suggest a time period when you know you don't need to get to much done since you will be sneaking off to read these!  Once again I highly recommend buying these all at once. You do not want to end one without having the next one ready to go!!
8590379825|5.0|So i got an email to write a review for this book, this is the first review I've ever written for Amazon so here it goes.    I am currently on chapter 5 of this book which goes into functions in detail. So far I've loved the book, it has given me a lot of information that I've been searching for. I also have the reference manual for version 5.1 of Lua in book format and using the two books together is indispensable. You can find the reference manual for free at lua.org. I jumped at the chance to buy the reference manual because Lua is an open source project, I prefer books over computer screens, and the guys that have worked tirelessly developing this language deserve a little help to keep it going.    I am a beginning programmer, I have done a little bit of C++ programming but that was years ago at the age of 14, I'm 19 now, almost 20. I work in the field of I.T. and currently do web design and page maintenance for California Pacific Medical Center. This book is easy to read, I don't mind the typesetting I think it's fine. It's teaching me everything I want to know. I'm finally starting to write scripts that are actually useful and when I read books on programming I like to buy a new mini-notebook and take copious amounts of notes so that I end up creating my own reference manual in my own words. This book has been enjoyable to read and take notes on, I'm learning a lot, I hope that eventually I'll be starting some interesting projects and writing World of Warcraft add-ons.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I decided to build my first computer and wanted a processor that would probably last years. After a lot of research I picked this processor. It is fantastic. Most of the time it runs at about 5 percent based on the Windows 7 CPU monitor. I can have many different windows open and there is absolutely no delay in working through any of them.     For gaming I play Civilization V, there is no delay at all. A great processor.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Great movie. Was at the Preakness when he won and the movie brought back the excitement for me. Later I got an up close look at this remarkable athlete after he was retired. Besides being a great race horse he was a ham for cameras and loved children.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|Well, I liked Season II and was so disappointed when the last episode just....stopped.  No closure or finish or goodbye or anything to let us know what might happen to the characters.  All I can say is \\"boo hoo.\\"  I hope those advocating for more Seasons are successfull.  Although I went to the website to cast my vote to produce more shows, there didn't seem to be a venue to do so once I arrived at the site.
1603425381|5.0|Many books of border patterns are relentlessly kitchy or grandmotherly (think antimacassars).  This book has lots of up to date ideas.  Also, the author thoughtfully explains the how to's - counting stitches, making clean corners, and so forth.  A really useful book.
1402210795|5.0|When I want to go to a pleasant place where the characters come to life with easy grace, and their problems are both humorous to the reader while appearing insurmountable to the heroes, I go to any Georgette Heyer regency novel. This one is particularly delightful. Take the innocent antics of a new bride add the unawareness of the new groom; toss in a few friends with foibles of their own, and you end up with Friday's Child. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and still do.
B004K8WPUQ|2.0|(This review is being done by my husband. I bought it for him but since he is the one actually using it, it only seemed right that he do the review.)    First of all, I did a lot of research before deciding on the Rode Videomic Pro.  I looked at video's on YouTube and read many reviews on this product.  I had many hopes for this product but after I received it, I was very disappointed. When I opened the box, it looked as though it had been a return and not a NEW product. The box was not damaged on the outside but the thin cardboard that holds the microphone was damaged.  It's as if someone had difficulty removing the microphone from the cut-out area of the cardboard and then didn't really care how they put it back in because it was torn and crushed.  I don't understand why Rode didn't put this in a styrofoam cut-out, at least for protection of the product or if not that, maybe at least some bubble wrap?  But it had NOTHING to protect it, so the box is a BAD design and someone at Rode should address the quality control issue.      At $229.00, I think it is an overpriced piece of plastic!  Yeah, I had all the paperwork that comes in the box, except the one to get the free Dead Cat but for the price, it should be INCLUDED, with a case!  I don't think Rode is including the paperwork for the free Dead Cat anymore.  Well, the problem I have with this one is it RATTLES!  It is something inside the tube of the microphone that is loose.  I shot some video while moving around and the rattle is heard in the video.  I don't think this is normal but if anyone else has this problem, it's probably defective, at least that is what I consider defective, and needless to say I will be sending this back. I will say this, the sound quality is very good and I don't know how Rode does it with everything being plastic.  The tube, that is covered with the foam rubber, is plastic, the base is plastic, and one reviewer indicated that trying to put the 9-volt battery in this thing is difficult, I would agree.  Read the directions first before attempting and then good luck figuring it out.  The cover for the 9 volt battery is also plastic but basically place your thumb on one side of the cover, your middle finger on the other side of the cover, and your index finger in the slot of the cover, push in and push up but be careful.  Like I stated, it's plastic and it's some expensive plastic at $229.00!  Also, the wire to connect it to a camera or camcorder is thin and seems like it would break easily.  Why it isn't a coiled wire like the Sennheiser MKE 400 is beyond me.  (The 10 foot extension cord does have a coiled male end.) Just beware and handle it carefully!    I will say, it does sound better than the built in microphone on my Panasonic HDC-TM700 but play with the settings because with the +20db setting on Videomic Pro and the TM700 set to 0db, the sound can be very distorted.  I was fifteen feet away from the camera and it does pick up a lot of other sounds including the fan noise on the TM700.  I found the best setting on the Videomic Pro at 0db and the TM700 also at 0db.  But it will depend on what you are videoing and the distance. Make sure you do some sound test before you do some actual recording or you could have a really good video with really bad audio.    So, here is the gist of my review.  Is this microphone worth $229.00? No, not in my opinion and I really think it is WAY overpriced for what you are getting...overpriced plastic!  Rode should put this product in a much nicer box with it in styrofoam or at least bubble wrap. It is very possible this is why mine has the rattle because it was just bouncing around in the box during shipment with nothing to protect it, and so something got knocked loose.  I also believe Rode should include the Dead Cat with the mic, and a case for the mic.  Even with all that, I still consider it overpriced by about $130 bucks!  It is made in Australia or that is what is printed on it.  Don't know what the priceof plastic is in Australia but must be difficult to manufacture or to obtain.  Maybe they should have them made in the USA but then that wouldn't work because of all the government regulation they would have to deal with and then the unions would want their share.  So, it's no wonder that so many companies have left the USA for China...less government regulation and don't have to deal with unions!  Well, this is a whole different topic for another time.  If I ruffled your feathers a little, just stop and think about it, that's all.    Anyway, like I said, I will be sending this back and hopefully I won't have too much difficulty returning it.  I have been a long time customer at Amazon and I wish Amazon would sell this and not through Kellards but no matter who you buy it from, the $229.00 price seems to be the going rate.  I couldn't find it any cheaper by anyone or any other website.  Also, I didn't do an unboxing video of the Rode Videomic Pro, there is already plenty of those out on YouTube.  I will do a video of the rattle and try to post it here if Amazon allows it and if not I will post it on YouTube.  Just do a search on Rode Videomic Pro Rattle.    Two Stars for I Don't Like It, but I don't hate it.  I just think Rode could do much, much better than this.  No problems with service from Amazon or Kellards.  Wouldn't it be nice to buy something that said \\"Made In The USA\\"?  I could give five stars for quality but it isn't there yet.  So, I hope Rode makes improvements to the boxing of the product as well as the product itself.  I understand the plastic for weight but it WILL break easily because that is what plastic does...BREAKS!  And beside, aren't just about all toys made of plastic?  This isn't suppose to be a toy but if you drop it, it will be a busted $229.00 expensive piece of plastic!  Hey, that's my review and if your angry, don't be, I just like to be honest and tell it like it is!     Veteran
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this book years ago when I felt like my marriage was in trouble. I won't claim this book saved my marriage, it took medication and counseling to do that... This book help me see how hard we were both trying and got me to a place where I wanted to save it (that's how far gone we were). Not only that, but it has also helped to strengthen my relationship with my children, they have different love languages than my husband and I! Sometimes it is hard to remember that we all speak different love languages, we are all becoming so fluent!!! A definite read!!
B000004166|5.0|This is a superb recording in every sense of the word, dating from the early 60's, assembled as a set in 1993. The recorded sound is flawless, but it is Grumiaux who determines the style and approach to the music. His sound is full, but it's French, which means light, not heavy and overwhelming. The orchestral sound and approach to the music follows the course Grumiaux sets; Colin Davis, Raymond Leppard and the London orchestras follow to make  the result stunning and most satisfying.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Pia Giovanni has spent her life hiding her true half-human, half-wyr nature from the world, running when necessary, leaving everyone and everything behind at a moment's notice when needed. Since her mother's death, though, the isolation and loneliness weighed on her to such an extent that one moment of indiscretion with a man she thought she loved proved to be her undoing. He may be her ex-boyfriend now, but he's still blackmailing her into committing the sort of crime that will guarantee her remaining life expectancy is considerably shorter than that of an average fruit fly.<br /><br />Breaking into the heavily warded and protected hoard of the oldest and most powerful Wyr Elders and stealing from the dragon is definitely not the sort of thing to do when trying to reach old age...or breathe your next breath.<br /><br />To say Dragos Cuelebre was furious when he realized that someone had dared steal from him - something that no one had managed to do in all his many, many years of existence...and he remembers the birth of the solar system, so we're talking some serious time here - would be a gross understatement. The powerful head of the Wyr demesne and owner of Cuelebre Enterprises, a major corporate conglomerate of unimaginable wealth and influence, made it his mission to have the thief caught. Her scent on a note left behind during the theft is what made him determined to be the one who caught her himself.<br /><br />Pia had run, though she knew it was futile. Dragos caught her, and had known that was inevitable. What neither expected was the talon-sharp sting of attraction, the mutual fascination, and the danger that they would both face when they realize that there is a much more insidious and manipulative force behind Pia's crime, a powerful evil intent on killing Dragos and keeping Pia for his own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004Q7DQLS Dragon Bound]] is one of those books that I fear I won't be able to do justice in reviewing. There were just so very many things that I loved about it that it becomes difficult to put it all into words. The world that Thea Harrison has created here is unique, detailed, and wonderfully descriptive. Cuelebre Tower reminded me a little of Archangel's Tower in Nalini Singh's Guild Hunter series, and there were definite similarities between Dragos and Raphael, but only in the abstract, as two very powerful and very inhuman creatures of unimaginable age and experience. The similarities served to enhance my appreciation of this book, not detract from it.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Harrison's writing style. The narrative was smooth, there was a perfect blend of exposition and description, dialogue and action, and several scenes truly impressed me for their complete originality and uniqueness. I appreciated that Harrison didn't overwhelm the reader with a ton of world building, and instead kept the focus on the demesne and characters and creatures relevant to the plot of the book. That leaves tons of room for further development and widening world view in future books as the series progresses and kept the plot from bogging down in overly extensive detail in this book.<br /><br />The plot itself was nicely layered but again, didn't overreach or overextend. Instead it was a sophisticated story woven with several strong, clear plot threads and cast with memorable, remarkable characters. The action scenes were plenty and brutal at times, but they were balanced with an admirable wealth of humor and a very complex and satisfying emotional journey for Pia and Dragos. In fact, while the motivation and parties involved in the theft that Pia was used to perpetrate was one of the major plots in the book, the relationship between Pia and Dragos was the story's focus, and I couldn't possibly be happier about that because I loved them both.<br /><br />They were exceptionally well drawn, three dimensional characters with their own brilliant individuality, their own strengths, weaknesses, and flaws.Pia was independent, strong willed, and had some major trust issues, but she was also uncertain of herself in some situations and easily overwhelmed by Dragos' largesse, making her pleasantly easy to relate to. She was smart, could handle herself, but had an aching need to belong somewhere that softened her character and made her sympathetic. She also knew when not to go tumbling into trouble of her own making, but wasn't afraid to go toe-to-toe with one of the highest of top predators to ever exist. I loved everything about her.<br /><br />Dragos was perfect in every way. His utter lack of conscience and his clinical confidence in himself and his powers was frightening...and his genuine bemusement and befuddled curiosity about Pia was often hilarious. He was arrogant, demanding, impolite, and more likely to rip your head off than chat with you, and he was delightfully charming when faced with something out of his extensive purview...like Twizzlers and Slurpees. Possessive, protective, autocratic, and dangerous as ten hells, yet tender and considerate in small ways. He was the perfect...the absolute perfect romantic hero and like Pia, I loved everything about him.<br /><br />There just wasn't anything I didn't like in this book. Nothing I could come close to critiquing. For me, this book shamelessly seduced far too many of my personal reading preferences to even notice anything that didn't quite work for me. If there were any, I glossed over them in my euphoric state of reading Nirvana. Heck, I even tried to read it as slow as possible because I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />The good news is that the second book in the series, [[ASIN:0425242668 Storm's Heart]], is due out August 2nd, with the third, [[ASIN:0425244407 Serpent's Kiss]], coming quickly after that on October 4th. I do so love when a new series I instantly fall in love with pumps out the first few books rapid-fire. It makes it so easy to become deliciously addicted. In all seriousness, though, [[ASIN:B004Q7DQLS Dragon Bound]] has instantly catapulted its way onto my list of Top Five Reads of 2011. If the subsequent books are even close to being as good as this one, I may have to expand that list to ten.<br /><br />~*~*~*~<br />Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.trust issues, but she was also uncertain of herself in some situations and easily overwhelmed by Dragos' largesse, making her pleasantly easy to relate to.

0316056863|5.0|My wife and I were reading this at the same time, but I fell behind because I take care of a 5- and 2-year-old, which is more time-consuming than my wife's job of bossing adults around in the outside world. When my wife had finished and realized that I was still reading it, she was jealous that I was still experiencing it for the first time. I thought that was quite a review. I guess this is more my wife's review than mine, but rest assured that I liked it, too, but I'm kind of sick of hearing how men are such pigs; however, if it's not coming from Tina Fey it's coming from the Governator. I like to call myself \\"God's Gift to a Woman\\" because I'm awesome, but only for one woman, and I think that makes me a lot more special than Jon Hamm. (If my wife wasn't such a Luddite and used the internet more she might disagree about both of those things, but she'll never see this.)<br /><br />Lastly, I'm going to invite Tina to our house for dinner for two reasons: 1) I know she trolls the internet for reviews and jagged barbs from meanies and haters; and 2) She is a lot like my wife, and I just wanted to see if I could produce a singularity, a black hole, or a time paradox by having them together in the same room.<br /><br />If you're ever in or around Hollywood North (aka Vancouver, Canada), Tina, please stop by for a bite. My Dutch-Irish wife makes a mean burrito. Oh, and we have a 5-year-old boy with white (Dutch) eyebrows, so we should arrange his future marriage.

0307279189|5.0|This is the best book about running I've read- it beats Dean, Pam and Running through the wall.  Like Chris McDougall  and most other runners I've been plagued with many injuries and have had my longest layoff in my running career these past 2 years. I also work and sell products within the running industry so the information in this book was especially meaningful and eye opening! Guaranteed to change the way you think and not just about running...     Runners beware- you'll want to ditch those running shoes, sign up for an ultra marathon, buy pinole and geranium extracts on Amazon to create a diet like the Tarahumara. What a great read. I am so happy I finally read this book!

0316056863|4.0|\\"Bossypants\\" is Tina Fey's memoir of her life, stint on Saturday Night Live, and as a lead actress/writer on 30 Rock. On-screen Fey has always been a comedian--whether it was imitating Sarah Palin during her McCain run, doing the Saturday Night Live \\"Weekend Update\\" section, or playing Liz Lemon on 30 Rock. Unlike many actresses, Fey's acting tends to directly correlate with her writing. In other words, Fey is much a performer as she is a comedic writer.     Not surprisingly, Fey brings that same sense of comedy into her own autobiography. The first third of the book is a chronological portrayal of Fey's childhood and young adulthood: During high school, Fey gets involved in local theater and makes light out of her friendship with same-sex couples. Eventually, she graduates from college with a degree in drama and finds herself helplessly unemployed. Fey recounts her various dead-end interviews, until her roommate who dated \\"an early Obama prototype\\" helps Fey get a job as a receptionist at the local YMCA.  There, she meets many depressing characters whose stories she uses for entertainment purposes.     Afterwards, Fey very briefly describes joining the Second City improv troupe and quitting her YMCA job, before winding up on Saturday Night Live after acing her interview with Lorne Michaels. The next two-thirds of the book cover her SNL and 30 Rock years, as well as her life as a celebrity. This is when Fey goes all out: you start to feel like you're attending her stand-up show. Chapters include Fey's take on various topics: photo shoots, beauty tips, bitchy NY/LA moms, motherhood vs. career, etc. mixed in with personal stories (especially memorable is her disastrous cruise-ship honeymoon).      However, don't expect to hear too much about Fey's life before SNL (the transition from YMCA to SNL is only five or so pages long), how her Second City gigs (or indeed how she got promoted to regular touring, after just taking a couple of classes) turned into an interview with Lorne Michaels, and (except for the honeymoon) how she connected with her showbiz husband. On the other hand, do expect an entertaining enough, non-traditional (not necessarily chronological and very comedy focused) memoir.

I really appreciate her comment that she felt her music was for the EARS, not the eyes.  She writes some fine lines and her vibrant voice conveys the emotions behind those words wonderfully.  One of the few times that just reviewing the music samples on Amazon sold me on the artist.
030726999X|5.0|After reading the first two in The Girl trilogy twice, the third and final installment finally was released.  The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest gave me a page-turner of a ride from Lisbeth's time lying in the hospital to the fast-paced and just ending.  Happy for the ending, but sad at the same time, I was very reluctant to say good-bye to one of my favorite characters in books, knowing her life in literature was over.  If only Stieg Larsson's heart had kept beating.    This book presents a complicated narrative at times, but it is this that reveals the underlying   plot that goes all the way to the the police and beyond, and that leads to Lisbeth Salander's trial. As with Larsson's other books, I read this one in a short time and I'll read this one for a second time, too.  I just don't want to let these characters go.    We are introduced to Salander's father, Alexander Zalachenko, and find out that her early years in an institution finally lead all the way to a special secret part of the police called the Section. Not lovers, but friends again, Salander and Blomkvist are an unforgettable pair.

030745455X|5.0|After reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo twice, I turned to The Girl Who Played With Fire, Stieg Larsson's second in his trilogy of books that feature Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. I loved the almost leisurely beginning of this one where Lisbeth is found vacationing in the tropics, enjoying the sun and carrying around not the latest best seller, but a very large mathematics book which she is studying. She has given Mikael Blomkvist the cold shoulder now for a long time, but with no reason.  In the meantime, Blomkvist, along with his Millenium staff, are working on an account of exposing members of a sex trafficking ring, which they plan on publishing sometime in the near future.    Mikael stops by the apartment of two friends who have information on some of the traffickers, and upon entering the apartment, finds the two shot dead.  A piece of evidence at the crime scene links it to Lisbeth Salander, and the hunt starts for her as the prime suspect in this crime.   During the second half of the book, there is a lot of action and suspense, and the ending is extremely surprising, leaving me with that \\"I can't wait to find out\\" feeling again.      I love Lisbeth's character for her strength and self-sufficiency and also her brilliance.  I love Mikael Blomkvist for his dedication as a friend and his cool-headedness.  There are also characters who appear in the novel who deserve my loathing. While waiting for the third and final installment in the trilogy, I read this one a second time, too.     If you haven't read these books, start with the first one or else you'll be lost.  They are well worth the time spent reading them.

B0018QQQK8|2.0|I usually love a Sparks book, and I had a hard time giving this a two-star review, but when the storm began brewing towards the end of the story, and it was meant as a clue to some bad stuff coming up next, I had to roll my eyes. He's done this in several of his books, using the storm, and the impending thunderstorm as a pre-crusor for a bad couple of scenes, so it felt like I was reading a previous book.<br /><br />I did like the first few chapters, but felt like it was a bit predictable in the middle and I could guess what the end twist was going to be. Having said that, I am still a fan though!! And I will read his next release, this one just didn't do it for me.
B004M20YDU|5.0|Best In Class  I will admit to being slightly over-obsessed with the TRON soundtrack, but it is with reason. Without gushing high praises to the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack created by Daft Punk I must admit this remix album stands on its own as a fantastic collection of seriously talented productions.     There is not one bad track on here, which is something I look for in an album and rarely find. *(Fall [M83 vs Big Black Delta] being the only song to close to questionable, but it grows on you after a while in a shoe-gazey, dream-pop kind of 80's M83-ish way).    The tall list of amazing authors, writers, and remixers to sign the guest-list on this album is inspiring in and of itself.     Derezzed (Glitch Mob Remix)- Is a slower, sicker, tighter, more raw, gripping, glitch-electro version of the original, with a touch of distortion and deep-as-hell low-end that just binds the track together and keeps it bumping.    Fall (M83 vs Big Black Delta) - He chose a tough track to remix, but the spin he gave it is interesting and quite far from the original adding his own flavor and unique 80's synth accents. Having said that the track still maintains some decent level of danceability.    The Grid (The Crystal Method Remix) - One of the best songs on the album as well as this year or by this artist. The track combines and highlights the best of their capabilities as well as the uplifting beauty of the original score. Crystal Method have graced and laced this track with their usual stomping break-beats, full with a nice stereo spread, on top of which is built a structure of synth work to compliment the groove. The stack is covered on top with the most bitey acidic-303 I've heard in years. The whole track is arranged properly, it just flows wonderfully and bounces back and forth between themes seamlessly. 4 out of 5 stars, the song ends abruptly without a sufficient \\"DJ-friendly\\" outro.     Adagio for Tron (Teddybears Remix) - By far one of the best songs I've heard inyears, not to mention one of the sickest remixes I've ever heard. I've never even heard of the \\"Teddybears\\" before this, but that didn't stop my absorption of this righteous remix. It's just jarring, and brilliant, combining a really fresh Electro/Techno feel to the distinguishable deep and tribal groove. Then the leads, strings, and pads just sizzle brightly over top of this giant beast of raw phatness in its drum track. It's quite a fantastic.     The Son Of Flynn (Remixed By Ki:Theory)- Sort of a dark and dirty, gritty, distorted guitars-affair that slams into an underworld of re-birthed break-beats, turning the soft mumbler into a screaming beast. Yet maintaining a cleanliness as to reference the pride in the melody and overall original score. It has a feel of something much more epic and live sounding like \\"Schiller\\" or \\"Trans-Siberian Orchestra.\\" I rated it five out of five stars also.    C.L.U. (Paul Oakenfold Remix) - Oh, Paul...you've done it again. At first I wasn't in love with the \\"Dominator\\" old-school brass pads in the track, but I figured out after about three times listening to it, that it was a translation of the original brass parts with more of an electronic spin. The track builds nicely with the arrangement of the original sustained by a much heavier electronic depth created by both drum and synth tracks. It is highly progressive house, more right wing trance even dabbling into GOA territory. A very epic and uplifting affair, it's a pretty heavy track.    Son of Flynn (Moby Remix) - I've seen this song taking a lot of flack on other reviews, but truthfully it is a quite fine soft-synthy mellow remixed version of the original song. I didn't find it highly explosive or dynamic, but it was clean and smooth none the less. He may not have changed much in the arrangement, but he redefined the limits of the sound taking it out of the TRON confines and placing it into a softer, slower Moby-World. It's not bad.    End of the Line (Boys Noize Remix) - A breath of fresh air. I am just proud to see Alex pull of successful work like this again. He always seems on target when remixing, unlike his original work of late that has strayed into experimental. He found a sound between his early work and the \\"Oi Oi Oi\\" album that was the formula for success, and his definitive touch. He has brought it back here, and blasted this track full of it. This mix takes the original lines of the song and translates them into the bloated Electro versions that slam from verse to verse through the track, backed with the balance of his synths to drums at a clean ratio. Very much dance-floor material while still maintaining a discreet level of listen-ability.    Rinzler (Kaskade Remix) - I like this track quite well, most especially because I feel of almost all the tracks on here *(except Derezzed (Avicci Remix) - which also carries away into a pop-feel), he may have imbued his song with the most of his own influence and sound. Straying, but not too far, away from the original score, he places a unique timing and rhythm changes the track and builds a very solid progressive House song in the process. It's by no means a complicated affair. This remix has formula, and I think it works very well for the song. He uses a lot of bright sounds and the synth work is enjoyable. At the same time, he still brings the original song to full meaning during the introduction, and the breakdown in the middle. He calls back to the theme and brings it into his track so well. Well-done Kaskade.    Encom Part 2 (Com Truise Remix) - I don't know what's with the \\"Tom Cruise\\" but that aside, this remix is a fairly accurate representation of the original with a soft and mellow glow. It has a methodical slower churning groove, and some very glamorous synth work. The track has a smooth almost \\"Japanese-Pop\\" sound to it, then brings back the main theme towards the end.     End of Line (Photek Remix) - Here's one for the beat-junkies, as Photek spins out this heavily disto-laced Electro banger. There's a decent amount of bit-crushing as well through the soundscape. It brings new verses to the original theme and a general dance-floor format to the original track. Quite a phat number.    Arena (Remixed By The Japanese Popstars) - This track is fun! It was impressive, to say the least, to see what they could do with this song. The format chosen here is a decent fusion between a sustainable progressive and Electro themes, while still bouncing back into the origins throughout the mix. This song has a very strong formulated arrangement and a certain amount of class. The rolling drums, along with the rest of the track work, just keeps the track flowing from one side to the other. While sounding new and fresh it also showcases some very old techniques and almost has a classic, more-vintage-electronica sound to it.    Derezzed (Avicii Remix) - This track is very catchy. I won't use the word \\"Pop\\" because it has no reference, but I will say that this is a very Classic House Style. However, it grabs hold of new Electro techniques and sounds wonderfully enthusiastic and just down right happy. This bright influence is a breath of fresh air to the sounds found on the album especially since the TRON theme was a fairly dark World.     Solar Sailer (Pretty Lights Remix) - This song fits the remix artist name very well; it is \\"pretty.\\" I was really enchanted with this sound. The original track is one of the slower songs by Daft Punk, so I was curious to hear what a remix would sound like. Somehow Pretty Lights have figured out just how to take a slow song and still make it banging. It hubs, jumps, cuts, and pumps. It's got a decent amount of grime, and that is matched with a healthy dose of the aforementioned \\"pretty\\" sounds. Their sound bed is quite ethereal and spacious, but they've managed to slam a fair drum track into the mix as well. I was surprised by how much I like this mix.    TRON: End Titles (Sander Kleinenberg Remix) - Another classic shout-out. While I find this track enjoyable, and even a decent remix, it simply isn't amazing. The generic big boshy, moogy bass popping around like a goofball just doesn't hold my attention. The 8-bit resolution lead synth lines are friendly enough. In this mix it just feels like the whole \\"epic-ness\\" of the TRON theme has been down-graded to a video game-like sound. Having said that, the rhythm of the track carries it along through the theme and combines a lot of funk with a more classical sound from the theme score.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This series is amazing. I highly recommend this getting the complete series collection. If only our government was run like this.

B0025KVLU6|4.0|Well, I love the Beatles and always have. Any other group just does not measure up as a package. Here the package is clearly divided into box, tape, directions and substance in the middle. With the supreme songwriting talents of Paul and John, their crap is most peoples' diamonds, you never have a tune that can be dismissed out of hand-there is always some aspect of quality, some refusal to hide behind spurious notions of dignity that dignifies the worst of the material. That being said-Good night is an atrocious song to include on a rock album-mawkish, over produced and saccharine-suitable for children who need soothing to make nightmares go away. If you feel that need, then this song is great....Lennon however is in fine angry fettle performing with his usual abandon and more venom than usual. Every one of his contributions, although credited to Lennon/McCartney-clearly a footnote to 2 years prior, are worthy of attention, with the exception of Revolution and Revolution 9. Number 9 is actually worth a listen, but it is not the product of tendons, vocal cords and strings. If you buy the record, you can get through it and find some amusement in its' sprawling pretentious montage. It is not a reason to buy the record, but rather one to avoid. The problem is some of the songs are so damn good, you just have to put up with it.Revolution is lame-I prefer the single where the implicit apathy of the lyrics is equally matched by the conviction of the performance  which sneers at  the worthless limited vision of the world revolutionaries who thought Mao actually had something going on-stupid idiots who had no clue of oppression. Someone once said it was a stunning preview of post-Beatles music-I agree wholeheartedly.Paul vacillates between fluff and actual meaning churning out great stuff like Blackbird and veering of into camp: Rocky Raccoon (which is charming in it's inoffensive way), Martha My Dear (rhythmically daring and melodically great-but ultimately a self-satisfied song about a man and his dog). Paul makes it all work because he is an honest unpretentious passionate performer, which was the core of the Beatles appeal in the end. George, well it took Eric Clapton to put an indelible stamp on a great tune, comes into his own here. I have always thought that George's work had an unabashed honesty-notice a theme here- that is appealing. Ringo-well-great, great restrained drummer who does not get enough credit as part of a superlative rhythm section of McCartney and Starr.Not a great songwriter, but a gifted drummer. Get it-it is far better than anything else out there these days
0307476154|5.0|It is unfortunate that Larson didn't live to see his trilogy in print or film, the success of both genre is astounding.

0071752854|4.0|Read it in a day.  On my second read with highlighter.  I've been in professional sales and fundraising for over 38 years and, from my perspective, Klaff has truly discovered a new approach to pitching.  Some of the writing was a bit awkward and a few of the concept threads seemed like they needed a bit more editing (hence the 4 versus 5 stars).  Nevertheless, if you are involved in pitching investors get this book.  Read it carefully.  Begin implementing the concepts.
0670022411|5.0|Yes, it's a novel about witches, vampires, and other creatures that inhabit a thoroughly modern world filled with oblivious humans. It had the potential to be a trite Gothic bodice-ripper from the pen of Barbara Cartwright or Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner's character in \\"Romancing the Stone\\"). Normally, I would avoid it, but it came with high recommendations from a friend. Amazingly, the story line drew me in quickly and held my attention to the end - not my usual reaction to such books. What a welcome relief to discover a very un-Gothic and intriguing page-turner from the pen of a new author, Deborah E. Harkness.<br /><br />The plot has an abundance of twists and turns swirling around a pair of star-crossed lovers, but Harkness avoided the trite by creating a multitude of characters with enough depth to hold interest and adequate realism to allow the reader to enter a world where witches, vampires, and daemons hide in plain sight. Her research is evident in the details. The territory around Oxford is accurately described, including the stores, the river, and the Bodleian Library; the background of historical witches, incidents, and individuals create a thick web of interest. Still, this is a light read, an enjoyable read. Careful scrutiny might uncover slips and flaws, but it is a wonderful novel and it arrived just in time for lazy summer days.<br /><br />Unfortunately, readers must now wait for book two in the trilogy and hope that Ms. Harkness can deliver a fitting sequel and still have sufficient yarn to weave a suitable climax in book 3. I'll keep my fingers crossed and pre-order book 2 as soon as it is available. Meanwhile, I'll re-read this book to ensure I catch all the threads in her intricate brocade.
0061134007|2.0|This novel disappointed. The plot is convoluted, which I probably could forgive, but it is just too unbelievable. The research is poorly done - it is not difficult if the author wanted to use a black South African as one of the characters, to generate a typically \\"black\\" surname - this was not done. The death penalty was abolished in South Africa prior to the 1994 elections - the novel is set in 2000 and the death penalty is still used. The result for me, was that I disengaged from the novel and felt insulted that the author did not do even basic research.

B000PC6Z48|4.0|Django stands out as an early spaghetti western that helped establish the tone and themes of the genre. In fact the film became so popular that studios started slapping the name Django onto all of their westerns, which resulted in hundreds of unofficial sequels that really had nothing to do with the original Django. Franco Nero inhabits the iconic titular character who manages to match Clint Eastwood's disquietingly monosyllabic man-with-no-name character. The plot borrows elements from A Fist Full of Dollars (which in turn borrowed elements for Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which in turn borrowed elements from Dashiell Hammett's novel, Red Harvest). I won't hold the fact that Django is a twice told tale against it, since most of these films trade in homage and bricolage anyway and because director Sergio Corbucci brings an economic style that marks the film has wholly his own.    Early in the movie, the titular hero, Django, who appears to drag a coffin with him wherever he goes, saves a woman, Maria, from being flogged to death at the hands of an unruly mob. He brings her back with him to a nearby town that is nearly abandoned except, naturally, for a whorehouse, which happens to employ Maria. The residents of the town have been trapped between two warring factions, a rogue contingent of the Mexican army and a gang of Southern white supremacists. Django appears disinterested in these small town politics at first--a position reinforced by Nero's minimalist performance--but we eventually come to understand that Django carries around more baggage than that old coffin.    As for what is inside the coffin, I won't ruin the surprise, although the trope has been borrowed often, specifically in the space-western anime, Trigun, that you likely have a good guess already. I will say, however, that the item in question becomes an all purpose device, serving as means for Django to carve a way out of a corner he has trapped himself in and, later on, as a macguffin to drive the plot forward. Of the two gangs, the ex-Confederate, white supremacists are the most menacing. These men wear red, pointed hoods that are obviously reminiscent of the KKK and capture and release Mexican farmers so that they can shoot them down like pheasants. Naturally, they don't take kindly to the Django's Union uniform.    The film itself is decidedly low rent. We are told that the town Django stumbles into is deserted because of the warring gangs, but most audiences know that the town is deserted because extras cost money. Unlike some of Sergio Leone's westerns, Django doesn't transcend the genre (it's less Raiders of the Lost Ark and more The Rocketeer). At times the commanding score by Luis Bacalov appears to be the only thing keeping the flimsy sets standing. And yet it's impossible to hold all of the films B-movie trappings against it, and not only because the filmmakers do a tremendous job with so little. One of the joys of the spaghetti western is that the genre has been emptied out. All of the weight of American myth, the trappings of manifest destiny, the world wearied job of nation building, have been dropped in favor of the truly essential elements of the genre, and then the filmmakers proceeded to push these elements to the breaking point. Unlike John Wayne and John Ford who became responsible for galvanizing the country around symbols of America, Carbucci and Leone had no such responsibilities. They saw the western genre for what it was: a fiction. They have not lied to themselves that these stories are anything other than movies removed by centuries, an ocean, and a few tropes from their source material. Spaghetti westerns are less concerned with the American west than they are with American movies.    I suppose this is why spaghetti westerns have captured the imagination of contemporary filmmakers like Tarantino, Takeshi Miike, and Jee-Woon Kim. Spaghetti westerns are movies about movies, the sort of meta-narratives that appeal to film nerds who have consumedthe entire repertoire of whole directors. It is also the reason why Django feels light footed, making its way from scene to scene without the burden of history. It is also why, as much as I love some of the work by Ford and Hawks, when it comes to stories about stoic men with a fast draw, I'll take Leone, Carbucci, Eastwood, and Nero every time.

1594202710|5.0|Dr. Kissinger has had personal experience with four generations of Chinese leaders, as well as building an appreciation of its long history. His \\"On China\\" primarily covers China's initial encounters between China and modern European powers, the breakdown of its alliance with Russia, rationale behind and its involvement in the Korean War, and President Nixon's historic trip to Beijing. The book is an attempt to explain differences in how the Chinese both view themselves as an exceptional civilization (cultural; non--applicable to other nations) and think about foreign and military strategy, vs. the U.S. (God-given, with an obligation to spread to others). Most of \\"On China\\" consists of a readable, but detailed history of China, along with how those events have shaped its leaders. Kissinger's historical accounting begins with with Confucius, and goes on to also summarize the forced opening of China by Great Britain and other 'barbarians,' Japanese and Russian occupation, Mao's takeover and creation of continual chaos, reclaiming former boundaries (India, Tibet, Inner Mongolia; crises over Taiwan), rationale for Sino-U.S. rapprochement, the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, and China's subsequent healing and economic resurgence initiated and led by Deng Xiaoping.<br /><br />Early China was plagued by internecine conflict that threatened the empire's sustainability. Confucius (551 B.C.- 479 B.C.), an itinerant philosopher largely ignored in his lifetime, provided the 'glue' that has both kept the empire together since, while uniting its people, and providing much of Asia's 'state religion.' Expertise in Confucian thought became the key to advancement after the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - A.D. 220) adopted Confucius' thinking. In doing so, the State assumed a moral obligation to provide virtue and harmony, and its people took on an obligation to obey the state as well as honor their ancestors and emphasize learning.<br /><br />Between 1405-1433, China's Admiral Zheng sent out a fleet of large, technically advanced ships to Africa, the Middle East, India, and other closer locales. The fleet's size, number of vessels, and sophistication dwarfed that of the Spanish Armada that was created 150-years later. The purpose of the voyages is unclear to historians, and the next Emperor ordered the fleet destroyed, along with Zheng's records of those voyages. The expeditions were never repeated. More significantly, withdrawal from Western nations limited access to new ideas and led to China being physically and economically dominated by others from the mid-1800s until the 1990s - its 'Century of Humiliation.' (China's share of the world's GDP was about 25% in 1500, grew to approximately 30% in 1820, and fell to about 4% in 1950.) Deng's re-opening China's economy in 1979 brought China back - it is now the world's #2 economy and expected to become #1 in about 15 years, based on purchasing-power parity.<br /><br />As an aside, Kissinger also notes that China's turbulent history has taught its leaders that not every problem has a solution, and that too great an emphasis on total mastery over specific events could upset world harmony. Important lessons that the U.S. could benefit from.<br /><br />Keys to understanding China: 1)Confucianism - a single universal standard of conduct and social cohesion. 2)Sun Tzu - outsmarting an opponent = good, conflict = bad. 3)China's recent history of humiliation. 4)Fear of social disorder.<br /><br />Human-rights activists will not be satisfied with Kissinger's lack of umbrage on human rights in China - especially regarding Mao; realists, however, will recognize that the passage of time, China's rapid economic improvement and Confucian history make the topic much less important to the Chinese. Those more sardonic will simply note that Kissinger's firm does extensive business in China and he does not want to risk that. Kissinger also does not cover China's newly acquired economic power vs. the U.S. via its extensiveholding of U.S. debt, our recent loss of respect due to the 'Great Recession' and our loss of manufacturing leadership. Regardless, \\"On China\\" is essential reading; it also clearly demonstrates why Dr. Kissinger is renowned among foreign policy experts.f respect due to the 'Great Recession' and our loss of manufacturing leadership.

Somedays I do the whole workout, other times I mix it and do a different cardio workout, then Cindy's upper body and abs, or vice versa.  It is a good hour long. Adequate warm up and cool down. She doesn't talk too much. The background is different - I love the desert part. I would say this is my favourite all time Workout DVD.
0553805371|1.0|The authors make the claim that religions such as Christianity are a way of trying to explain what cannot be fully understood.  Yet, many the theories they present have to be taken on faith. A major premise of the authors' is that the universe we see if one of many. Even though that may be mathematically possible in his equations, there is no way it can ever be proven. In other words, we have to take it on faith. I'm sorry but I already have a faith, and I prefer mine over the authors' imaginings. Watch them come up with another even better `theory' once the sales of this book fall.
0439023491|3.0|Admittedly, my review and opinion on this book are colored by having also read [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]. I will try to restrict my review to this installment, however.<br /><br />I really enjoyed [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]. I found the concept completely new, which is rare for any book. The writing was superb, as it still is in Catching Fire. With Catching Fire, however, things start to get a little predictable. I could see where this was going a mile away, which greatly reduced my enjoyment of it. Without the suspense of the first book, there was little to carry the story along, in my opinion. The writing and characters are excellent, no worries there. Just be warned, if you really loved the first book, you may be disappointed where the series is headed.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I am impressed with how cheap this great quality backpack is. I have 2 t2i with battery grips, 4 lenses, hoods, chargers, tons of other accessories and they all fit in this backpack. It feels great in your back and it has enough pockets. I doubt that you can find something this good for this price.
B003UESJHE|5.0|I've been aware of King George's struggles for a long time but did not realize how debilitating they were.   This movie is sublime.   I find it refreshing that such a mesmerizing story can be ever bit as engrossing as any of the \\"big bang\\" blockbuster extravaganzas.   The acting is extraordinary.   I think it would have been good to pay a bit more attention to the importance of the King's speeches during those dark days of WWII for the brave British.  I'm primarily writing this simply to get another five star rating for this worthy Academy Award winner.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|Reminiscent of those 80's high school comedies, 'Easy A' adds a refreshing feel to a very old premise. Emma Stone is excellent as a girl who can't say NO, but what she doesn't say No to is why you need to see this film. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are fun as Emma's liberal parents and the entire cast seems to be enjoying this delightful and fun romp through high school for the umpteenth time.

There are great projects to get started and continue with templates to help decide what shape you want to work with.  This is the best bead embroidery book I have ever bought.  The book is also great eye-candy.

I am not much of a reader to begin with this started out with it being a reading assignment but the second I started reading this, I would read it purely for the enjoyment of it! This book takes you into the Taliban infested mountains of Afghanistan with a team of the worlds best warriors, the US Navy Seals. This book begins with the rigorous and tough training of becoming a US Seal, then it takes you into the mission itself which is the most epic and suspenseful pages one will ever read!
1595826971|5.0|Few game creators are as recognizable as American McGee is. Even people who have never played his Alice game recognize the artwork (such as myself- I watched a friend play it), so it makes a lot of sense that McGee would eventually venture back into the insane world of Alice. And because of that there's all new glorious artwork to behold!<br /><br />Just like with the original game, the artwork in this is just incredibly beautiful & freaky to behold. There's just so many different art styles here to look at & all of them are wonderfully detailed. Also included in the book are several explanations behind the characters, the ones that made it in & the ones that didn't. This is about the closest you can come to picking McGee's brain without pulling a Hannibal Lecter on him!<br /><br />The only downfall about this book is that now a whole slew of people are going to be eagerly awaiting the new game's release in June. This is just a gorgeous book & I can't wait to see what this all looks like in action. Seriously, this is one of the more beautifully laid out artbooks I've seen.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />(ARC provided by Netgalley)
0634049011|5.0|Fantastic workbook on learning guitar scales.  You do need to have a basic understanding of the guitar to begin with, or as one of the reviewers said, you'll be lost.  This is not a how to play the guitar book.  This is a workbook on learning, memorizing, and understanding scales of the 6 string guitar.  I have been looking for a learning guide like this for a while.  Although I have been playing, on and off, for nearly 30 years, I had never had a lesson other than books.  This workbook, by far is the best that I have seen on learning the neck of the guitar.  Finally I understand.  I highly recommend this workbook.  But, get the workbook and not the kindle version.  The Kindle version makes it hard to copy the pages so that you can do the lessons.  I'm still trying to get the ink off of my computer screen. :-)
1582701709|2.0|I thought this book was pretty vague, but overall, it will help you understand the Law of Attraction and just how important it is to keep your thoughts focused on what you want to attract.  We should all practice positive thinking and use positive affirmations on a daily basis.  There's nothing new in this book, but it's a good reminder which we all need every now and then.  I do have to add that I think the marketing people behind The Secret did an excellent job in creating a lot of buzz for this book and movie.
0307472841|1.0|As the old saying goes, \\"even Homer nods\\".  Mankell not only nods in this novel, he falls from his chair.  Despite the interesting speculations around the new versus old China, there are numerous flubs in the novel (the Chinese brothers on their way to Canton eat their last supply of food several nights in a row).  Much of the novel is obvious and predictable and the protagonist is saved by divine intervention at the last moment.  The weaving of the story is clumsy, strained and slow.  Too many dead ends.  Characters generally are poorly developed and the only strong character, Vivi, fades into oblivion.  Her disinterest in following the Chinese connection is out of character for her strong, assertive and independent character.  Time for Mankell to leave Mozambique, forget about shipments to Gaza, leave Mars and come back to earth.  Kurt Wallander is much more believable.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I've been a fan of the Stargate genre since the original movie, and have watched SG1 and SGA from the start of each series. When SG1 was cancelled, and then ultimately SGA, I was greatly disappointed. But with the possibility of SGU coming into the fray, there was hope to continue the theme, but also to see a new twist on the original. SGU had the potential for wonderful things: further glimpses into ancient knowledge, the wonders of the universe (and new and unknown villains), as well as commentary on the wrong people in the wrong place making a go of it in spite of seemingly overwhelming odds. I enjoyed the cast-based episodes, the crew's interactions with one another - some found the prospect of continuing more than they could bear; others found it mind-expanding. It was more than simply good guy vs bad alien (or other humans who were bad); it was more than saving the planet and the galaxy each episode - for every explosion, we witnessed what we might really see from people who were NOT trained to go forward when the walls were crashing around them (non-military, scientists, etc., and well, let's face it, some of the military people as well). Although this is the end of the series (sadly), I do hope that its ending provides a jumping off point for a DVD/BR-mini-movie, or several \\"specials\\" on the Sy-Fy Channel. It's not that I expect to see a miracle happen, and they're all magically transported back to Earth, but the manners in which this series should really end are as endless as the potential for alternate realities.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I have been a Yes fan since 1975. It is amazing the way they interpret the song Ritual from Yes Topographics Album. I watched the video with these young people and Yes and using a Bose sound. I'm really happy to say that all the songs are really good including the songs from Magnification and Fragile albums. The only thing is I missed Rick Wakeman and William Bruford. Good for the group becaused after more than 30 years they are still very good and continue making the best. I wish the best for them, they are alredy part of the progressive rock forever.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|I read this book after seeing a pretty display in Barnes and Noble.  What a mistake, and one I will not make again.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT******<br /><br />This books is a contradiction.  It deals with some adult themes such as oral sex and it has the same character calling horse manure \\"poopie\\".  Yeah, that's right.  \\"Poopie\\".<br /><br />The character is supposedly in high school, yet all of the references to movie stars and celebrities are old middle aged people.  If a teenager is going to reference a celebrity, chances are it will not continually be someone in their forties and up.<br /><br />The entire rumination of \\"coolness\\" gets old.  If you are reading this on your Kindle, do a search on the word \\"cool\\" and see how over used it is in the book.  It is just ridiculous.  Coolness is pretty much like air, the only people who worry about it are those who are trying to live without it.  I think the author is insecure in her own self to be honest.<br /><br />And the writers prejudices show through out the entire novel.  She is very anti-Christian.  Even goes as far as to reference \\"People of The Faith\\" and \\"The Faith\\" with capitalization.  All of her Christian characters are evil or bad characters.  I am not a Christian, but being of a faith that has been demonized in the past, this is troublesome to me.<br /><br />Basically, this book reads like a middle aged lady trying to \\"be cool\\" and her prejudices show the entire time.<br /><br />Oh and this is a \\"traditionally published\\" piece of garbage.
B0000264PW|1.0|the editorial review says \\"the only Japanese remastered version\\" of this gem. I was so thrilled when I got my ordered copy of what I expect to be the remastered version of this album just today. to my surprise, I got the same 1988 original album pressing! I was expecting it to be in a different packing since I thought it was a Japanese version. I have been waiting for so long to have this album remastered only to get very very disappointed! to the editorial staff at amazon you should be giving right and appropriate descriptions of the products you are posting for that's what and where we, the costumers refer our choices whether or not to give it a shot. the item is good, only not remastered.

1936041111|3.0|Frankenstein is a wildly imaginative book by a brilliant author, Mary Shelley. Shelley, way ahead of her time, writes a story very different from those seen in modern horror movies. She uses the technique of reeling her readers in and then playing with them. In Frankenstein, the character Victor is a curious person; he yearns to learn the secrets of the earth. Attempting to fulfill his desire he comes up with the insane notion to recreate life after it has been destroyed. Of course, afterwards he sincerely regrets it since the monster he creates wreaks havoc. Shelley shows the horror of the aftermath of playing creator and sends a chill down the spine. Shelley forces readers to rethink their own lives and desires. I read Frankenstein not as a piece of fiction, but as a piece of Biological Literature.<br /><br />There is a very short amount of time in the book that talks about Biology, but when it is discussed, it is almost as if Victor is able to use his brief education in human life to bring a creature to life using electricity and parts that are pieced together. Conveniently enough, Victor never reveals his secret to life, in case someone were to repeat what he did and create another monster like his. This, we know, is completely impossible, and since Shelley herself had no education in biology, we know that she was using a literary device known widely as \\"black box science\\", in which something works because the author tells the reader that it does--a truth universally acknowledged.<br /><br />There are several scientists in recent years who are attempting to follow in Victor's footsteps and are trying to grow blood cells and skin tissues from corpses, in an attempt to prolong life or even cheat death. Their success rate will be questionable, of course, but their reasoning is seemingly much more noble than that of Victor Frankenstein.<br /><br />It was an excellently written book in terms of fictional appeal, but in the way of biology, it is quite lacking. To find more about the impossibility of the act of creating life from death visit the following websites, which offer articles concerning several different topics having to do with Shelley's ideas in Frankenstein.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]bility of the act of creating life from death visit the following websites, which offer articles concerning several different topics having to do with Shelley's ideas in Frankenstein.

B004124VG2|5.0|Sufjan Stevens is a mastermind when it comes to making music. Every time Sufjan makes a song you can tell it's him. His critically acclaimed album Illinois was known for the orchestral arrangement of melodies and adding layers of strings and trumpets, and all sorts of interments in it, while also having great poetic lyrics about history, culture and aliens.<br /> It would take Sufjan five years to come out with The Age of Adz album.<br /> He once said in an interview with pitchfork, \\"I'm getting tired of my voice. I'm getting tired of ...the banjo. I'm getting tired of...the trumpet.\\" He wanted something new, and he felt like he wasn't going anywhere creatively.<br /><br /> He got inspired to make a new album when he helped his friend film a documentary on a Louisiana artist names Royal Robertson. Sufjan became inspired and found that he began writing lyrics based on the artist's visions and paintings, and Royal Robertson's personal life, and thoughts and views of the world.<br /> Around this time Sufjan became very ill. After helping his friend, Sufjan found himself being almost bed ridden and unable to make music. During this time, Sufjan really focused on life and death and living, and also remembered Royal Robertson's views on the world; consequently, you can hear on this album in his voice has some urgency he uses his voice in layers and gives himself a ghost-like feel, and you here in his lyrics the views of death ; for example, he writes a song about himself and uses his own name in the song called \\"Vesuvius.\\"<br /><br />Sufjan would later end up using Royal Robertson's artwork in the Age of Adz cover and inner sleeves. At first listen, you will find the opening track \\"Futile Devices\\" will have Sufjan with beautiful arrangements of acoustic guitar and piano playing that is soothing and a typical Sufjan Stevens sound while still having trumpets, horns, harps and a choir in the background, giving an opera feel to it which the rest of the album will consist of.<br /> Sufjan manages to give you layers and layers of sound and many tones in a track; as a result, you find yourself replaying the album, and trying to name what instruments and what sound you just heard.<br />On the album title track `'The Age of Adz,\\" you will hear instruments, but also you will hear what sounds like a car alarms and chants and find yourself in a circus type feel and have mixed melodies. Listen and you will find that he gives you imagery in his sound and organization of song form and lyrics. I found myself wondering what he is meaning, and the more I listened I started piecing it all together.<br />Then I found out that Royal Robertson suffered from depression and went crazy after his wife left him and all he did after was make signs and write his thoughts of the future. It all starts to make sense that Sufjan used his life and mixes Royal Robertson's life and combines them and writes lyrics that will fit him and Royal Robertson, and bring the listener into this world which makes you as a listener feel like you are let into ones person's life, and you go through this roller coaster of a story with him.<br /><br />I will admit at first listen I wasn't sure what to think of this album. I found myself at a record store, and I Loved the album art of the Vinyl LP and bought it because I knew of Sufjan's previous work, and I liked a couple of tracks from his last album Illinois.<br />It came with an mp3 download card which allowed me to download the entire album. I put it on my mp3 player, and I began to listen to to. At first listen, I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't until I put the vinyl LP on my turntable that I realized how amazing this album is. The instruments' sounds have room to breathe on vinyl, letting you hear how detailed and beautiful this album is.<br />Sufjan Stevens goes for a big dynamic sound which you will hear in The Age of Adz. You will find his writing style is more of love and loss and more about Sufjan himself, which is a firstfor him, but also he has this end of the world theme coming from Royal Robertson's thoughts about the future and of dooms day artwork he always painted. The last and final track of Sufjan Stevens' Age of Adz is a twenty five minute track called \\"Impossible Soul.\\"<br />This is my favorite on this record. It tells a whole story in itself and keeps you engaged until the end. It leads you into a story about a man and his mind set after a girl leaves him, then switched to a different point of view, then goes back to the man's mind, then goes to the woman's' mind, then you are left with something beautiful.<br />If you are a fan of music and like to listen to albums as a whole, I think that you will find much depth in this album that you might not get it on the first listen. But when you give it a little more listening to, you will find something that is truly a masterpiece.for him, but also he has this end of the world theme coming from Royal Robertson's thoughts about the future and of dooms day artwork he always painted.

0446364495|1.0|Usually the movie does not do justice to a good novel (the reason why I will not see a movie of a Jane Austen novel).  Here, however, the movie is far superior to the original.<br /><br />The author has an idea, but no gift or joy for writing about the idea.  He writes \\"and then she went back to her boring, uneventful life.\\"  Really?  Tell us why it was so boring.<br /><br />I also dispute that Iowa or the Midwest is so boring.  It's an unexplained, unexplored assumption and presumption.<br /><br />This book is a collection of cliches like that.  Other cliches in this book is that men of a certain age want to live near the water.  That the guy never forgot her or had sex with anyone else till the day he died.  Yeah right.<br /><br />Or that neither of the two resented that the other did not check in to see how they were doing. C'mon, there was no resentment whatsoever?  They just \\"respected\\" each other?<br /><br />Or that she could not hire a detective to find the guy's whereabouts after her husband died.  Or she couldn't hop on a bus and explore Washington state herself.  She was so tragically landbound.  C'mon, she is intelligent and has some discretionary income!  Her kids were grown.  What was the real reason she does not do so?  Because she is afraid of rejection?<br /><br />This book is more like an outline for a screenplay.  The dialogue is very paltry - like cues for a professional writer to \\"write it out,\\" elaborate.<br /><br />Merciful that it is so short - you can read it in three hours.<br /><br />I howled with laughter at the last part of the book where the \\"soulful\\" black jazz artist is describing in his colloquial slang-filled \\"black English\\" how deep and feeling the Kincaid character is.  What a cliche.  I am glad the movie left that whole chapter out.<br /><br />I think the ideas are good - so few books are about a middle aged woman's life changing affair - just that a better writer was called for to explore the complexities.<br /><br />What would Annie Proulx have done.  Compare this story to Brokeback Mountain.  At least Brokeback showed that it looked like it was the affair of a lifetime, but the Jake Gyllenhaal character was actually a cheat, though he also sincerely loved Heath Ledger.  Brokeback in less pages covers much complexity and paradoxes of the human heart.t least Brokeback showed that it looked like it was the affair of a lifetime, but the Jake Gyllenhaal character was actually a cheat, though he also sincerely loved Heath Ledger.

B0042J6VUS|1.0|It was cool to find a tripod that held the new iphone 4 with the case still attached.  The picture online and right on the package showed that the iphone or other smartphone can be mounted in the holder and used vertically or horizontally. When I attached the iphone it worked ok in horizontal mode but as soon as you put it vertically it tips over right away and every time!  Not a good product.  It could use some design changes so that in the vertical position the 2 legs are on the opposite side for stability.  There is only one grove on one side of the tripod that the holder can fit into.  I had to send it back for a refund.

0345529057|1.0|I agree with the other comments.  The price for this series is ridiculous.  I purchased the 1st book in the series just before the mini-series started for $4.99 (the remainder of the books were $5.99 or $6.99).  When I went to purchase the second book, I was stunned to find the price raised to $8.99.  I can by the paperback version at Wal-Mart for $6 and some change.  These books are overpriced.  Only greed can account for the recent price raise.  Drop the price and I will buy the remainder of the series.

B000001ES9|5.0|Rush (1974) is the debut album of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and John Rutsey.  Yes - John Rutsey on drums.  This album was before drummer Neil Peart joined the band and replaced Rutsey, who left the band.<br /><br />Ever since Neil Peart entered the fold in 1975, the band has never been the same.  Peart's masterful drumming and lyrical genius catapulted the band into superstardom.  He single-handedly changed the direction of the band.  Gone were the days of simple lyrics and straight up regular hard rock.  Peart's lyrics combined with the musical ability of all three members not only added a whole new and different dimension to the band, but the band was taken more seriously and gained a tremendous amount of respect from fans and some critics.  Suddenly this band that released this self-titled debut album in 1974 with simple lyrics was being viewed as a thinking man's hard rock band that appeals to brainy fans.<br /><br />Now about this album...<br /><br />Lifeson's guitar is heavy, Lee's vocals are super high-pitched, and Rutsey's drumming is very good.  This album features the classic Working Man.  In my opinion, every song is great.  Finding My Way, Need Some Love, Take A Friend, Here Again, What You're Doing, and Before And After are my favorites.<br /><br />If you want to hear Rush's roots, the beginning of their career, then get this hard rocking album.  Don't let the fact that John Rutsey is the drummer turn you away from this album.  It rocks.
B0041T4ML4|3.0|Okay, I read others review before purchasing. I actually got into the book after slogging through the first few chapters. One of my problems was that what appeared to be interesting characters simply dropped off, like Hiroko. Okay, I like loose ends tied up, I admit. The ending just seemed rushed and as one reviewer pointed out, an opening for a sequel. It was almost as if the author said, \\"I'm tired of writing now, let's put this to bed\\". In short, it left me pretty unsatisfied in the end.
B004SBB0LU|4.0|I recieved my Box Set Yesterday and spent most of the night listening to everything. Today, I listened to all 3 versions of Queen II that I have. The '91 Hollywood Records release, the Crown Jewels release, and the 2011 Remastered release. There is a slight increase in volume, but not overly done. I felt that the '91 version was slightly flat compared to the 2011 release. I can only compare the versions that have been officially released here by Hollywood Records. With that being said, I found that the changes made by Bob Ludwig to be very subtle and unobtrusive.      After reading one review, I was a little concerned about the audio compression. So, I compared several songs throughout this box set with their '91 counterparts through audacity. The \\"Loudness\\" of the 2011 releases have been raised, but not as much as I would have expected. There appears to be plenty of dynamic range left with these releases. The sound quality is impeccable and have never sounded any better on a U.S. release.     Unfortunately, I feel that the bonus E.P.'s are lacking. There is so much unreleased material that could have been used to fill out the rest of these discs. For this reason, and the fact that the albums were not released in surround sound, I did not give this set 5 stars.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|Title says it all....we LOVE this movie. It's a tradition in our household, ever since I was a child too, to watch it Christmas Eve while we hang stockings and wrap the remaining presents. My children love this movie as much as I do.
B001675SOY|3.0|I repeat my review of \\"Something Wild...\\" here: \\"This was just a little too Yngwie Malmsteen for me. I was expecting a little bit more straight-forward thrash. It's not bad. Just not what I was expecting. There are lots of keyboards and the vocals, oh, the vocals, if you could call them that, are just high-pitched screams. It's very technical guitar and very fast-paced, which I like, but I don't really care for the Malmsteen-esque classical influence, the high-pitched scream vocals or the excessive, over-the-top, doom and gloom keyboards. I should have sampled these guys more before I purchased. If you are looking for a more straight-forward, less-niche sound, stick to the Exoduses and Slayers of the world.\\"  I will say that this release is a bit more refined.  I CAN listen to this music, it isn't terrible, it just isn't my preference.  I was thinking I would get something like 5FDP or maybe Shadows Fall, something newer but still in a Thrash-ish vein.  Not so.  I guess this is \\"black metal\\" or something like that.  Whatever it is, not really my thing.  Give me Megadeth or Pantera.  Maybe I'm just too old...
B001BPQT8A|5.0|After reading all the complaining about the price of this blu ray I waited, and waited, and waited some more to upgrade one of my favorite movies.  Well I should not have waited because the Blu Ray is definitely worth the upgrate.  The picture quality is simply beautiful and you are also given a choice for listening to at a new 5.1 sound mix which is also excellent.      Don't wait. Upgrade to Blu.

0307346617|4.0|I was somewhat of a latecomer to this recent \\"zombie fiction craze,\\" but easily recognized this book as being on the crest of the wave, rather than one of the imitators.  As others have noted, the tone here is unique for the interview style the author adopts to tell his story.  So the result is a \\"first hand\\" acoount of the entire zombie plague from the earliest stage of outbreak to the end of the war.    As one might expect, some of the interviews fall flat.  But the majority cut right to the bone, each exposing another gritty detail of the post-apocalyptic breakdown of society.  Especially impressive was Brooks' attention to detail here.  He really seems to have given a lot of thought to considering all aspects of what might happen if society really was to collapse as a result of some sort of outbreak.  The fact that he uses zombies as his literary device gives the whole thing an added edge that should appeal to both fans of the zombie genre and others just wading in for the first time.    If you're looking for a novel that deviates from the norm, but still provides a nice, dramatic, punch, you can't go wrong by picking up this book.
B0049D1TCM|4.0|I will say that this album is a great listen overall, because of the fact that it is for both fans of pop and/or rap music. This album has both these genres mixed that give the album the ability to be listened to by a larger fan base of both of rap and/or pop. Her songs are fun, catchy and can definitely see which other songs will be on the radio. Her album should be enjoyed for the fact that it is just a fun, catchy album. My favorite tracks are Roman's Revenge, Fly, Moment For Life, Super Bass, Blazin, and Save Me.

B004INNRFK|4.0|David Foster is a genius when it comes to writing and producing music, but the artists on his first CD/DVD were more popular (Celine Dion, Peter Cetera, Michael Buble`, Katharine McPhee, Andrea Bochelli, and several others).  The performers on the \\"Return\\" CD are not as good, or lesser known.  They were still good, but if given the choice, I'd go for the first Hit Man!  Wonder if he'll come out with another \\"Hit Man Returns Again\\"?  It is an excellent variety of our favorite hits.

B004K4IZ54|4.0|Plot and acting are just alright, but film is visually stunning. The whole film wasn't shot in 3d, but 3d portions look great. The regular BluRay is amazing. This is 3d content worth owning, and on it's own the 2d BluRay is incredible too. If you're a sci-fi dork, but this now.
1594202842|4.0|Having been raised by strict Asian parents who emphasised academic achievement and obedience to elders, I initially defended Chua's \\"Chinese\\" approach and assumed most of the critics were culturally biased \\"we're-all-winners\\" types who'd only read short excerpts or newspaper articles about the book.      Well, I have finally gotten around to reading this memoir and I can tell you that the widespread criticism of Chua's parenting approach is indeed justified.     I certainly agree with some aspects of Chua's book - such as when raising children, we must assume strength, not fragility. However, Chua's methods of bringing out her children's strengths is horrifying. She openly berates her children. She doesn't know the meaning of picking your battles wisely (a tactic I believe every parent of a teenager must master, whether Chinese or Western). There is not a single moment of interlude for these poor kids, as Chua even rents out piano practice rooms every day during overseas family trips. Then she sways to bribery and cajolement when threats fail to achieve instant obedience. Often I found myself shaking my head, thinking that this is not \\"Chinese parenting.\\" It's controlling parenting.     There are certainly elements of Asian parenting that Western parents can learn from, just as Asian parents can learn from their Western counterparts. But Chua is a fool to expect that two children raised in America will thrive on a totally Chinese approach. They do not live in China. You need to take into account the environment in which your children grow, without necessarily abandoning your traditional approach. After all, isn't that what Chua herself expected of her parents when she married a Jewish man? I find it so sad that her children weren't allowed to interact with their peers as kids normally do in America - playdates and sleepovers and all.      To give Chua credit, she does acknowledge that her rigid parenting was the wrong approach for her younger child. However this admission comes with great reluctance - it still \\"pains her every day\\" that Lulu quits the orchestra and negotiates to practice the violin by herself for \\"just\\" 30 minutes a day. When Lulu was finally permitted to play tennis and showed signs of aptitude, Chua immediately goes into her smother mother mode, researching the best trainers in the area. She only retreats unwillingly after the horrified Lulu pleads her not to \\"wreck tennis for me like you wrecked violin\\" with demands for perfection and endless practice. Chua's reluctant change of tactics don't redeem her enough in my eyes after years and years of harsh control and obsessively perfecting her daughters' musical skills.     In her obsession with grades and musical achievement, Chua seems to forget that excellence in academia does not guarantee success in life. Often it's the social skills and other intangible traits that enable people to win that important project, to get along with your boss, to charm a difficult client. Many excessively strict parents who emphasised academia above all else are today wringing their hands asking why their perfect, Harvard graduate child can't seem to find themselves a job, or unable to keep a job, or constantly passed over for promotional opportunities. The equation of success is more complex than being the best pianist or the student with most A-plusses in the year.     Throughout the book Chua seems fixated about enforcing her notions of \\"Chinese-style parenting\\". There is nothing Chinese about neurotically controlling every minute aspect of your child's life and then resorting to emotional blackmail, bribery, and sarcastic criticism when your child refuses to obey. This is called \\"bad parenting\\" across all societies. As a Korean mother married to a Chinese husband, I find her ideas of Chinese parenting not only inaccurate, but repugnant.    With such sentiments, do I recommend the book? Yes. The book is like a train wreck you can't take your eyes off from. Despite the creepyhelicopter parenting it still makes an intriguing read, if only to delve into the psyche of an obviously bright Yale professor who makes abysmally poor parenting choices. But don't reward Chua's neurotic smothering with royalties for this book - borrow a library copy if you can. I don't think I can quite stomach a second read, anyway.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Back in October 1998, I was working in the Gallery Place neighborhood of Washington, D.C., when on a lark I went into the old Olson's book store (RIP) near the Shakespeare Theater on my lunch break. The science fiction and fantasy section of the store was pretty meager, but it was the only bookstore in the neighborhood, and I had time to kill. As I scanned the titles on the single row of hardbacks, my eye caught something I couldn't believe I was seeing -- A Clash of Kings by George R.R. Martin. Sitting on the shelf, a good three weeks before street date. Of course, I bought it -- I was incredibly thrilled at my luck. No other fans had read it! When I got home, I posted the chapter list on Usenet, and to my surprise, almost every single response claimed that I was lying. I chalked it up to sour grapes and finished the book before it event hit the street.<br /><br />Now, thirteen years later, I have just re-read A Clash of Kings as part of my epic re-read of A Song of Ice and Fire corresponding with both the HBO television adaptation of Game of Thrones, and the imminent release of Dance With Dragons. Clash of Kings is still an immensely great book, which like the first, centers on the arrival of a new king's Hand -- in this case, the unlikely Hand, Tyrion Lannister -- in King's Landing. Unlike Ned Stark, however, Tyrion is much better equipped to deal with court politics, but a different set of personal weaknesses endanger his reign.  Meanwhile, war engulfs the river lands, Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis both vie for the Iron Throne, Dany continues her journey to the east, and the Night's Watch strikes out to discover where all the Wildings have vanished to.  Theon Greyjoy is added as POV character, and along with Tyrion, offers one of the most interesting arcs in the book.<br /><br />It's somewhat easy for Clash of Kings to be overshadowed by Storm of Swords (the best in the series thus far) and Game of Thrones, but there is still much to recommend about it. The ending is both sad and hopeful at the same time, a true Empire Strikes Back style ending, and Martin begins to turn the screws on his characters in ways that not even Game of Thrones could anticipate.sad and hopeful at the same time, a true Empire Strikes Back style ending, and Martin begins to turn the screws on his characters in ways that not even Game of Thrones could anticipate.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth was an extraordinary natural history documentary, reviewing life on earth in 13  x 50 minute episodes. This BBC (2007) series is a superb complement to the international 2010 Biodiversity Goals and the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment project, providing a much needed global perspective on biodiversity and its value to us, particularly in its appeal to our sense of wonder. Planet Earth was produced by Alastair Fothergill with much narration by David Attenborough, and additional narrators giving voice-overs to the audience. The quality of footage was exceptionally lush, with the aim of the production team being to use \\"the power of the scenery\\" (Fothergill) to showcase the immense beauty of natural and wild earth. The series focussed on the behaviour and interactions of charismatic species in wilderness landscapes. Biodiversity is visualized at a profound level - we see life in ten terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine biomes around the world, in ways that we have not seen before. Planet Earth combines population, species and ecosystem perspectives on diversity, explores ecological interactions and the processes of change in species and ecosystems.<br /><br />The series was ground breaking in several ways. Firstly, innovative new technology, such as the heligimble, allowed stable filming from helicopters, hot-air balloons and ultralight aircraft, with cameras that could film wide-angle landscapes and zoom from kilometers away to high resolution close-ups, without disturbing the animals. With this and other technologies the series gave a novel perspective on wild landscapes and was able to capture behaviour, such as a African wild-dog pack hunt, that can only be understood from the air. Secondly, a sense of purpose combined with a lavish budget led to filming in numerous locations, some of these in very remote places with extreme climates, such as winter in Antarctica. The  highly motivated film crews combined with a willingness to invest sufficient time and patience to film rarely seen iconic species throughout the earth - snow leopards, six-wired birds of paradise and oceanic white-tipped sharks are but a few memorable examples. The final footage was of unstinting quality. Scenes that we have seen previously were done better, with a focus on interactions and behaviour rather than simply recording the species. In addition there are even more scenes that we have never seen before; bouncing frogs on Mt Roraima in the Venezuelan tepuis, massed hordes of sea-snakes hunting with predatory fish on remote Indonesian reefs, and an immense mound of cockroaches in a Bornean cave. A third innovation is that the film crew emerges from behind the camera to become the human focus of the series - acknowledging that they themselves are also a driving force for conservation. At the end of each episode there is a 10 min documentary about the experiences of filming in one location, with scientific consultants and local residents just part of that crew rather than the focus. The series goes out of its way to approach the issue of conservation from the perspective of a wild earth. There are rarely shots of developed or degraded landscapes and the narration is focussed on wild nature, avoiding negative hectoring about environmental destruction.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Planet Earth does have a message: there is a biodiversity crisis, we have a lot to lose and we can do something to prevent this. While the first ten episodes convince us through their beauty, the last three episodes of Planet Earth comprise lucid and insightful discussions, interspersed with footage from earlier episodes, giving the sometimes conflicting wisdoms of conservation leaders, senior public servants, philosophers and scientists about the environmental challenges facing humanity.and patience to film rarely seen iconic species throughout the earth - snow leopards, six-wired birds of paradise and oceanic white-tipped sharks are but a few memorable examples.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|During a recent sleepless night, I happened to \\"click on\\" OWN and saw that Hachi: A Dog's Tale was beginning.  As a dog lover, I was attracted to the title and as a woman I was attracted to the human star of the film, Richard Gere.  I sat and watched and have never been the same since.  It was the most beautifully done movie about the bond between man and dog that I have ever seen.  Why this movie never made it to a national release, I do not know.  It has made millions worldwide and it was a deserving movie to accomplish this.  You will fall in love with both dog and man in this film and when you watch the last 5 minutes you will need tissues...a box of them!

Blue Velvet is strange with various plot scenarios and it's full of quirky characters that are flawed and completely deranged.  Dennis Hopper's character was annoying and he cussed way too much, every other word was the f word. I've seen Blue Velvet at least 3 times and I still don't know what it's about.

B00004UEE5|4.0|This is one of the most perfect classical music DVDs that I have ever seen.  The venue is simply gorgeous.  All of that wood on the stage must have cost a fortune.  The orchestral playing is magnificent, especially the all important brass.  Unlike some Vienna Philharmonic DVDs, the musicians are a mix of both men and women which is much easier on the eyes than all men.  There are even three female horn players, which is very rare.    However, I had to rate this DVD only 4 stars because I disagree with Barenboim's interpretation.  The Mahler 5th is a very powerful and passionate symphony.  Playing the music as written, it is exciting and quite moving.  That is how Georg Solti conducted it in his famous recording, also with Chicago.  Barenboim stretches the music, he tries to add to its power by slowing down passage after passage, adding about 7 minutes to the music.  Other conductors play it this way also.  I like it played straight.      I would recommend the Abbado/Lucerne Festival recording.  The playing is not as perfect as Chicago but the interpretation is much cleaner and in the end much more enjoyable, in my opinion.

0307454541|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  In fact, this trilogy has become my favorite books of all time!<br /><br />It all starts with this one - \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  There are several gruesome and disturbing scenes, but overall it was absolutely thrilling!  Some of the Swedish names were difficult to keep track of, but make sure you do your best so you won't get lost.<br /><br />If you like mysteries and thrillers, and are not intimidated by a pretty rad heroine, I highly recommend this book!
B0001I562I|5.0|I bought this for my neighbor's 9 y/o. She has a weigh-able imagination and I was introduced to SciFi about her age. I had to do with a copy of Heinlein's 'Have Space Suit, Will Travel'; but this is a good intro for a kid to the land of \\"what do you mean, it's impossible - free your mind.\\"<br /><br />Good little flick for this. With any luck at all she will find Zelazny by the time she is 20.<br /><br />Read like a lift off, little one.<br /><br />The movie arrived on time and in good condition. Of course I watched it first.
0316098329|5.0|Wow!  This was definitely a great read!    At first, I was hesitant to read the book because of it's disturbing premise - a young girl who was kidnapped and gave birth to a boy, living through horrible and abusive conditions.  But, due to the high number of positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.    I thought the book's beginning was a bit slow and felt a bit annoyed reading it as a 5-year-old child would speak - some run-on sentences, grammatical errors, etc.  But, later realized that this was actually necessary to set the plot, so I kept reading.  There were several parts that were comical, particularly in the second half of the book, and many that were emotional.  Suffice it to say, I cried at the end.      If you can get past the disturbing premise, I highly recommend it!  Embrace the unique writing style, and just keep reading.  The story also makes good points on social issues relating to imprisonment and captivity.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Don't need to summarize the book- everyone else already did. That's not reviewing, gang. Short review: Very good stuff. Heinlein would be proud. The whole series is good, this one was my favorite, though.

0312600844|5.0|i read this book because of the hype... and i enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />i found all the characters believable and lovable for various reasons. they are all humans with their own shortcomings and their selfish motivations. but despite these i find almost all the main characters lovable and i sympathize with them. i think this is because all the motivations behind each one's acts were well explained (without sounding like preaching).<br /><br />this book is long and took me several months to finish as i never got to read for more than 2 hours at one setting. but all the characters and events were quite vividly depicted that i never had to go back to revisit anything. so overall i think this is a serious fiction with lots of humor embedded and serious topics covered with many nice touches of heart-warming...
B004ISVH5W|4.0|Richard's first solo CD (Alone with Everybody) lends itself to repeat listening - I've probably heard it 50 times. His 2nd (Human Conditions) was a lower energy affair but still pretty good. His third (Keys to the World) featured songs that were more compact than we were used to hearing from him, but again, other than the single \\"Why Not Nothing\\", the energy level was generally decreasing from that of his first solo CD and his work with the Verve.<br /><br />His new CD (United Nations of Sound) has the energy that has been largely missing from his last two solo CDs. I still have to spend more time with it to fully judge it, but after two sort of quiet CDs it's good to hear him get loud again.

B00362DRNG|1.0|Personally, I never really fell for the remasters - at least not for the last 12 years - a period of considerable 'remasters' terror that record companies practice mercilessly on the consumer... Not that I don't have some of today's remaster favourites, but altogether the whole remastering campaign became so frustrating, confusing and completely contra-effect.    For a long time now it's being obvious that every two-and-a-half years period (if not every year), a (major) record company is about to launch another \\"special\\" edition of the album that's been already out earlier in some already \\"special\\" edition - obviously, no matter how \\"special\\", \\"de-luxe\\", or \\"extra plus\\". A typical form of manipulation by the market. One might think it's regular releases that became quite rare and impossible to find... All these reprints, digipack redesigns, and not to mention vinyl re-releases are so artificial these days - sterile, plastic, so 'new'... you can tell from most sleeve reproductions (practically a medocre TIFF of what once was a real thing).    Which makes it all truly and utterly (and predictably) boring with all these editions - because, it's nothing but competing in how exaggerating a CD packaging can get, in order to persuade the consumer to rid himself of some more considerable cash for something he already has and has been overplaying to bits (just look at the special edition rape of Primal Scream's 'Screamadelica' or Bowie's \\"Station To Station\\" re-issues).    I understand the fan's urge to collect his/her favourite album in best quality available - but did anyone ever ask themselves, when the hell there's ever gonna be the ultimate, last sound (and visual) update?! Well, the conclusion is up to you - because it's an obvioous rhetoric question with a big NEVER on the end of this horrific consumption tunnel. It dependes on you and you alone - if you'll buy something every time it turns out,  no matter how many variations you already collected, just for the sake of it - then there's nothing particularly wrong with the industry, something is seriously wrong with YOU.    And now for the infamous Duran Duran - yes, their debut was one among those rare situations where I swore I would buy a representative re-issue. And when I saw the double disc digipack edition in the local shop, I was very happy - despite the fact I still enjoy my original LP, a CD covering Duran at their earliest commercial breakthrough immediately sounded like a bliss. Without suspecting anything, and mind you, the packaging is really nicely restored (if only it could have been without the 'New romantic' dance instructions sheet reproduction and that too metallic silver foil), I payed for the CD, rushed home and pressed play - and then, mere a few seconds into 'Girls On Film', I felt like being unscrupulously robbed (think of a robber cutting off the arm to add insult to injury). Didn't pay much attention to the rest of the album, the sound quality, etc. Hearing that the camera snapshot intro was damaged, this whole re-issue CD thing immediately turned into such an expensive farse, I simply rushed back into my local shop where I bought it, and asked for an exchange. I decided to trade DD for Robert Wyatt's EP's box set instead. All nicely printed - and remastered... Forgot about the \\"Duran Duran\\" re-issue. Erased it from my memory. Will not buy it, despite the corrections supposedly been made. Because it is all a bloody fraud.    On the other hand, secondhand compact discs (and records) no matter how old, have always had far more sentimental value to me. Townhouse, Nimbus, PMDC, PDO... Not that these weren't experiencing mastering/pressing problems - remember PDO CD's with disc rot? But despite that, all these LPs/CDs age with some grace. Nowadays, both LPs and CDs don't age - they just continue to die a slow and painful death... and take many fine albums with them, washing them down the drain.    And anyway, 'labels' like EMI are anything but music. Remember that.

0201721481|5.0|I've read 2 c++ books before. This C++ primer 4th ed. is the 3rd one and the best. The previous c++ books I've used are either too brief to clearly clarify the key concepts, or too wordy such that it easily makes the readers get lost while reading inbetween the lines. In contrast, This 4th ed. C++ primer is concise and meanwhile intensively convering almost every aspect about c++ that a novice shall be aware of. The most interesting, while most valuable part about this book is, it introduces the usage of class type from the very begining and keep getting the readers involve deeper and deeper, instead of only involving the class type at the last part of the book (as many other books do). The benefit is obvious. By so doing, the reader naturally accepts the key concept of class type and becomes more and more familiar with its usage and underlying idea of it: c++ is a strong data type language, everything can be treated as a data type. I think this is the essence and beauty of c++, and this book clearly manifests this point. Strongly recommend it to those who has some experience with c++ but still looking for a clear-writen, intensive, and extensive c++ tutorial.

B004SBQAN8|1.0|This was the only movie I've ever walked out of.  I Am Number Four is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. It felt like one of those straight to video B-grade crap you find for two dollars at the bottom of some bargain bin deal that you only look through because it's there. Everything about this movie is horrible: the story is pathetic- teenage kids(who look like 24)with powers (sort of like a toddler version of X-Men) fight evil aliens (rip offs of the truly creepy aliens in Dark City). The acting is pretty bad. When the \\"movie\\" introduced the \\"sexy-girl-blowing-up-her-house-why-she-walks-in-slow-mo-set-to-rock-music\\" I actually started laughing. The fact that people stared at me at my local theater with frowns was just plain sad. How stupid are American audiences becoming? Pretty stupid to have this movie chart at number 2 during its release. In fact writing this, having to actually explain why this movie is bad-beyond-belief is just making me nauseated. It doesn't even dignify a review. I felt embarrassed that my friends sat engrossed throughout the entire thing like it was Citizen Kane or something while I waited in the lobby counting carpet stains. In summary: if you want to feel stupid and perhaps wind up a little dumber - see this movie.
B000W1YYRC|5.0|Bands with such profound genius are rarely experienced twice in a lifetime. Sigur Ros have simply altered what we believed to be possible in the world of music.    From the moment the drama begins with the \\"guitar-plugging-in\\" sound until you notice it again seemingly turning off the the album, you journey from the most dreamish landscapes to the coldest and richest atmospheres and back. Although there is a reduction in the amount of instrumental layers involved (when compared to their other works), () offers an intensity, magnitude, and pure epicness that is unmmatched. A subtle hope is established as the backdrop of the first half until it transitions into a darker more contemplative state during the second, all to leave you seemingly physically exhausted from the massive and infinitely epic conclusion of #8.     If you want to experience new depths of life and music, () is an album to lead you on a journey.
B001NCJO60|5.0|First thing:<br /><br />Maybe amazon had at one time, the wrong version of the album (the censored version) here, but let me assure you that every f-word and other goodies are here.<br /><br />Second thing:<br /><br />I've been listening to this album since it came out in 1995 and I still love it. I like the way that they incorporate sound bits from B-movies and, yes, B-porno-films (More Human Than Human). These sound bits make the album sound bigger than itself. The music itself is very well done and the album as a whole sounds very good.<br /><br />I can't recommend this album enough.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is fantastic and has already been said, this is NOT a diet book. It's an in depth analysis of why we get fat, the biology of our bodies and why physics cannot be applied to something that is a hormone/insulin process.    Brilliantly understandable.    What's more? I've had this book a mere two weeks...and it's already changed my life. I don't mean that in an unduly dramatic way. I mean that thanks to this book, I have broken my plateau and actually lost most weight in the last couple of weeks than I have the last couple of months. Even though my original interest in this book was what it discussed in disease like in \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" it's insight into obesity is what led the way.    I highly recommend this book. I'm amazed, highly pleased, and found that it adequately explains and hints at things I have casually observed. As Mr. Taubes suggests, I think the science community needs to take a closer look at this so that we can explain what the data shows us versus what is current 'conventional wisdom'....
B0050G3NWG|1.0|i have read on numerous occasions that the camera negative for  CITIZEN KANE no longer exists. my point being with \\"older\\" films  unless the camera negative exists don't bother issuing a blu-ray   disc. look what happened to KING KONG(1933). the blu-ray disc issued  last Sept. 2010 by Warner Bros. Home Video was not mastered from   the camera negative which no longer exists but from the best quality   print they could find. while it was the best the film had looked and   sounded on home video there were wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to many  scenes that may me go-\\"this is a blu-ray disc?\\". so i don't have high  hopes for the blu-ray disc of CITIZEN KANE.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne is one of the best singers I know, and I love the lyrics she writes. This album was fantastic!  Take Me Away-10/10 My favourite for a long time. I identify with feeling unable to control my thoughts and how painful it is in this case.  Together-10/10 It's sweet and sad, and full of feeling. Need I say more?  Don't Tell Me-8/10 Pretty, I guess, but while it's popular, it's not that great, even if it is a single.  He Wasn't-7/10. More so than \\"Don't Tell Me\\".  How Does It Feel-9/10 Drags on for far too long, but I love the idea behind the song.  My Happy Ending 11/10 Seriously, what's not to love?  Nobody's Home-10/10 I sometimes feel this way. How does Avril get into my head like this?  Forgotten-6/10 Just a bit boring.  Who Knows-6/10. OK, but a bit boring.  Fall To Pieces-8/10 I don't really get Avril's idea, but I love the song.  Freak Out-10/10 Love it!  Slipped Away-7/10 It's just a little hard to get into.  I Always Get What I Want 7/10 The idea's boring, but I like the song.

6305229449|5.0|When this movie came out I was a preteen and could easily relate to Mulan. I am not Asian but I still related to her attempt to find herself. This is one of my favorite Disney movies (Aladdin , the Studio Ghibli releases, and Lion King being some of the others). Recently, I purchased the VHS for my son and he absolutely loves the movie too. This will be a family favorite for a while.
B003Q6D27S|4.0|Let me talk about the product before I talk about the movie itself. Im a HUGE fan of \\"Behind the scenes\\" & \\"The Making of\\" and \\"Behind the traps\\" which ALL of the previous Saw films had, all 6. This one had NONE, granted I did enjoy the Deleted scenes on this and I like that it has 2 commentaries but they totally dropped the ball on the behind the scenes stuff.     Now for the movie itself. IM A HUGE fan of the Saw franchise. That being said, I think this was rushed. The writing, and I can tell. This is \\"supposedly\\" the final chapter, but theres so many lose ends and so many unnecessary things. I enjoyed the splatters and all the traps very much, but idk, it didnt feel right. Maybe it was because Torbin Bell was hardly in it. And this film confirms what I've been saying since I saw part 5, the biggest mistake they made in this Franchise is killing Jigsaw off in the 3rd film, they should've kept him alive in a few more. 6 Was a much better story and film and twist than this movie    That being said I hope theres a part 8, in fact, no I HIGHLY doubt that there wont be a part 8, its like they left so many things open, and so many little things that they didnt normally do...there almost has to be a part 8. And if there is a part 8, mark my word, it'll be out after 2011 which will give the writers more than enough time to come up with a amazing movie, one that is worthy to be their last one. BUT at the same time if there is a part 8, theres a very good chance it wont be the last one, especially if the box office performance is great. Wheather its next year, the next 5 yrs, or (in Screams case) the next 15 years, I know there will be a Saw 8 and it will kick Saw 7's butt.    So I give the DVD 3 stars & I give the movie 4 stars.
B004SC8XHI|5.0|Whether Booker T. and The M.G.s should've been so audacious as to remake the Beatles Abbey Road as an instrumental is now history. This was their next to last album from the Stax era with basic tracks laid down in Memphis. Having owned this on EMI UK vinyl, the original Fantasy CD (lacklustre), the ZXY 24 bit master from 2001 (improved somewhat but mainly in increasing the amount of tape hiss) and the Universal Japan SHM- CD  (2009 - excellent) I have to say that Concord's Stax Remaster is an improvement on the latter for a quarter the price - great to have. Booklet notes excellent - plus additional Beatles tracks from archives and other Booker T. and The M.G.s' CDs - what's not to like?  New management at Concord in the person of a Chris Clough is now overseeing the Stax label after the utterly embarrassing \\"all mouth and trousers\\" 50th Anniversary initiative which ended up - with the exception of an utterly excellent remaster of \\"Black Moses\\" in a facsimile of the album sleeve that was 20% the price of the SHM-CD remaster that was extremely difficult to find - adding nothing to the Stax/Volt legacy - was Dusty Springfield necessary on the US \\"Boy Meets Girl\\" reissue?  Where Mr Clough takes us from here will be interesting - surely \\"Melting Pot\\" and maybe the Cropper/King/Staples masterpiece \\"Jammed Together\\" (why only part 1 of Tupelo on the Definitive Albert King??).   Good to have Stax brushed off and polished up - but - as Concord's vision of Stax moves to upgraded 24 bit remasters of the archives - much to the delight of soul music audiophiles - the paradox is the rest of the world heading towards downgrading said upgrades to mp3s.

Specifically, the author, Ken Moody, a Chartered Tax Adviser, deals with employee share acquisitions which do not benefit from any special tax advantages.<br /><br />So, whether you're a director or employee, or if you're involved either directly or indirectly with the running of an owner-managed business, you would do well to have a read of this useful volume in its 250 page entirety. Moody explains how the rules for taxing such share awards as the EMI and ERS actually work.<br /><br />The rules governing non-HMRC approved share options are included, as well as options which qualify under EMI. Capital Gains Tax, PAYE and the implications for national insurance are also covered, together with deductions made against corporation tax which may be claimed by the owner-managed company.<br /><br /> `It is difficult to simplify what is not simple,' admits the author adding that whatever your queries as an adviser in this specialist and somewhat abstruse area of tax, you'll no doubt find the answers you seek in this book.  Certainly, a glance at the Table of Contents and useful index will indicate the wealth of detail contained therein.<br /><br />Despite the complexity of the subject, Moody takes a plain English approach and the meticulously numbered text and commentaries are therefore approachable as a result, especially as they are accompanied by any number of practical examples to illustrate salient points.<br /><br />In the words of the author, a tax expert of over thirty years standing, the objective of the book is to provide professional advisers with the tools to enable them to give proper advice to owner-managers of (largely) unlisted private companies in matters relating to employee share acquisitions, an aim in which we've no doubt he has amply succeeded for the professional community.<br /><br />One can only applaud his thoroughness!  For those wishing to do further research, the book also includes an extensive Table of Authorities but this is very much a `what you need to know' book for your legal library.years standing, the objective of the book is to provide professional advisers with the tools to enable them to give proper advice to owner-managers of (largely) unlisted private companies in matters relating to employee share acquisitions, an aim in which we've no doubt he has amply succeeded for the professional community.

I would not be able to run my practice without it.'<br /><br />This terse and appreciative comment by a typical chartered accountant typically spotlights the usefulness and indeed the necessity of acquiring this latest edition of Tolley's Tax Guide, particularly if you're involved professionally in any matters relating to UK tax.<br /><br />Unlike other tax guides which specialize in one or two categories of tax - stamp duties for example, Tolley's Tax Guide covers the full range of UK taxes.<br /><br />Aimed primarily at tax advisers, the book is also deemed to be equally accessible to business and personal taxpayers -- and on the whole, we would agree, except that we're sure the more accountancy knowledge you have, the easier the subject matter is to understand.<br /><br />Nonetheless, you can be confident that whatever your tax query, the answer resides in Tolley's, whether you're concerned with income tax and capital gains tax (self-assessment included), or corporation tax, inheritance tax, value added tax (VAT) and stamp taxes.  Also covered are council tax, business rates, statutory sick pay, maternity, adoption, and paternity pay as well as NI contributions.  Worked examples abound and are typical of the book's practical approach.<br /><br />One of the well known and much depended upon range of Tolley's annuals on tax, this guide is now in its twenty-ninth edition and bang up to date. The wealth of new material therein includes commentary on the third Finance Bill of 2010 published and in receipt of Royal Assent in autumn 2010.<br /><br />All chapters incorporate changes that have taken place since the last edition and most of the chapters feature `tax points' which usefully point up the various tax planning opportunities available within the various categories of tax.<br /><br />Presented in straightforward language, this latest edition should prove indispensable in helping you gain a fuller understanding of tax, thus assisting you and those you advise in reducing tax bills.  Certainly, the guide is made as easy to use as possible, with a terrific fifty page subject index, detailed table of contents and of course, tables of rates and allowances, plus handy summary of the main tax changes.<br /><br />In all, Tolley's continues to live up to its reputation as `a great reference book', well organized and packed with practical information and strategies... and certainly remaining a title you should re-order each year.this latest edition should prove indispensable in helping you gain a fuller understanding of tax, thus assisting you and those you advise in reducing tax bills.

It is, rather, an excellent starting off point for those who wish to explore a particular issue or aspect of European employment law, and/or the employment laws of particular European states.  The authors therefore refer to it as `a comparative guide' rather than a `definitive' guide, which they modestly insist it is not.<br /><br />This new Second Edition published 2010 by Spiramus begins by reviewing the ways in which labour law has evolved within the EU...it examines the varying regional approaches to employment and social welfare...and it considers the numerous pressures for change in line with the controversial process of creating `social' Europe.<br /><br />The handiest part of the book is the summary in outline of said employment regulations in each of the now 27 EU member states, from Austria to the United Kingdom.  There's a further section covering future EU enlargement if, or when the two aspirant states, Turkey and Croatia join the EU.  Check the table of contents for the sub-categories with which you are concerned, from contracts to working time, to pay to dismissals.<br /><br />It is enlightening to be able to compare, almost at a glance, the differences and similarities in employment legislation between the diverse member states.  It's also heartening to note that, as a requirement of EU membership, each member state has had to bring its system of employment laws -- despite variations --into line with EU standards.<br /><br />So, if you are an employment lawyer or HR practitioner faced with cross-border employment issues, or in charge of employment policy in a European country, this book will help you understand and (it's hoped) avoid the various pitfalls and obstacles inherent in the many regional variations in employment law and practice throughout the EU.

1907444432|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3BGUT5ZGS2JP2]]HERE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TAX ARBITRAGE.<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />\\"International tax arbitrage is a form of legitimate tax planning.\\"  So declares Nigel Feetham, the author of this really quite enlightening, fascinating and thought provoking book, which sets out to explain arbitrage: what it is, what it does and why it has engendered such controversy, particularly in the UK -- even though, like it or not, it's legal.<br /><br />As a partner at a leading Gibraltar law firm and Visiting Professor at Nottingham Law School, Nottingham Trent University, Feetham is both an international lawyer and an academic.  His book is therefore useful if you wish to understand the ins and outs of arbitrage -- and it is not to be unexpected that he emerges as an extremely competent advocate of the practice.<br /><br />`Tax Arbitrage' is, in his words, `unashamedly not a technical tax book nor is it a typical law book.  As such, it's as much intended for...interested (laymen) and business people as it is for tax practitioners and students'.<br /><br />As mentioned in the book's introduction, arbitrage is one of two kinds of international or cross-border tax structuring (we assume that means avoidance?). One emanates from zero tax jurisdictions, commonly termed `offshore' or `tax havens'.  The other is `tax arbitrage' - for which there is apparently no single definition and in which, because of its specialized nature, there are no more than three-hundred practitioners worldwide.<br /><br />Feetham has therefore set out to demystify tax arbitrage. He examines some of the resultant press coverage, including some recent court cases, as well as campaigning by certain pressure groups. He also considers the confusion over the boundary between `legality' and morality' as well as the difference between `avoidance' (legal) and `evasion' (illegal), an issue which should of course be of abiding interest to lawyers, accountants and others in the financial services industry.<br /><br />Basically, tax arbitrage is a `commercial activity that...seeks out differences in tax rules in two or more jurisdictions to achieve a tax benefit.'  The term seems to have originated in the Wall Street Journal in 2006 in which `tax arbitrage' was described as a system which `plays off one nation's tax system against another to reduce the banks' tax bills'.<br /><br />Subsequently, the term became rather better known when the post-banking crisis finally emerged, with governments (make that taxpayers!) having to bail out financial institutions - hence the topicality of this well-written book and the interest it will inevitably create.<br /><br />For further research, the book provides useful sources relating to this highly specialized subject, together with Table of Cases, appendices and index.  The publication date is 1 March 2011 and this work gets the informative legal balance on tax arbitrage just right.ccountants and others in the financial services industry.

0780619951|2.0|and that was $3 too much!  I had recently read the classic H G Wells' novel on which the movie is based and wanted to see the latest theatrical adaptation of it.  I know some reviewers liked the campiness of this movie, even elevating it to cult-classic status.  I, however, am not a fan.  Yes, there are some strong performances (I actually liked Brando and Kilmer in their roles), but the lead actors were rather weak and the story was drastically changed in the up-dating.  Unfortunately, I don't think there is a more decent movie version of the novel, so if you are planning to show this as a tie-in to the book (I work as a teacher), you might use it as a counterpoint to the novel (eg, Why were things changed from Wells' original?)
0738206709|5.0|The most recent previous review is now about three years old, so an update may not be out of place. This book is a decade old, published shortly after the turn of the millennium and, more importantly, a couple of years after Gnu/Linux and the open source movement finally hit the big-time; i.e., acceptance by, and endorsements from, some of the major players in the computer arena, like IBM, Sun, Dell, Intel, etc.<br /><br />The author boasts that, at the time of writing, the Apache (open source) server software was used on about 25% of servers on the internet; today that figure has tripled to an astounding (approx.) 75% share! The Gnu/Linux operating system, largely fueled by the Ubuntu distribution and the Gnome and KDE desktops (GUIs), is used by a respectable share of the desktop computer community world-wide, and is growing at a healthy rate.<br /><br />While the author's predictions for the future of Gnu/Linux and open source software was decidedly optimistic, it was still somewhat tentative. However, subsequent growth during the last decade has been phenomenal. Not only does it appear that open source software is here to stay; it may even eventually come to dominate over traditional costly, proprietary software. There is now no shortage of experienced computer users, myself included, who are willing to make the case that the Gnu/Linux operating system, the Apache server, and the Firefox browser are much superior to the offerings of their closed source, for-profit competitors (e.g., Microsoft and Apple).<br /><br />This book is still an excellent place to start for anyone interested in both the history of, and philosophy behind, open source software. Here's where to learn about the formative years and the leading figures behind the movement, larger than life characters like Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Eric Raymond, Larry Walls, etc. It's also a good place to learn just why it is that the open source method of creating software has been able to produce such superb products. Highly recommended.superb products. Highly recommended.

I hate to give a book that I haven't read completely only 2 stars but the kindle version prevents me from reading a portion of this book.

0553805371|4.0|As usual, I understood half of a book on this topic, but anything that explains life and the universe and our place in it keeps me interested. There were times I was just reading words, but it was still enough that I could pull something out of it. Any more detail and I would've drown.<br /><br />The authors attempt to infuse light-hearted humor into this topic for uber-nerds but the jokes come off like uber-nerds writing their own jokes. If you want good humor mixed with exposing the secrets of the universe, try Death by Black Holes by Neil deGrasse Tyson.<br /><br />Nevertheless, The Grand Design lends a hand to us mere mortals that we might understand the nearly unexplainable.

What they don't know is that a group of goblins had laid a trap to kill the unicorn and take the horn. Lily helped trap the unicorn and didn't even realize it. While she was petting it, Blix, the leader of the goblins shot a poison blow dart at the unicorn, killing it. He then cut off the horn and gave it to his master, the lord of darkness who is really the devil's son. After that, the world is plunged into a state of dark winter. Jack, with the help of his forest friends led by Gump must right the wrong that was done by Lily's harmful but innocent attraction to the unicorns. The goblins capture Lily and the surviving unicorn. Jack gets armour and a sword and sets out on his mission with Gump and the others. Meanwhile back in darkness's lair he develops an attraction for Lily and seduces her with jewelry and a possessed dancing black gown. She dances with it until it swoops her up and she becomes the dark princess. Darkness's bride. Darkness then magically appears through a mirror and tells Lily his intentions toward her. Take note that she alternates between the innocent Lily we knew and a more worldly and cunning Lily. She even goes so far as to provoke Darkness and laugh coyly at him when he becomes enraged. She decides to play Darkness's game for a while and asks Darkness to allow her to kill the unicorn as a wedding present. Of course Darkness is overjoyed at just the thought of this. Meanwhile Jack, Gump and the rest of the gang are listening in while Darkness tries to woo the princess. They overhear him tell Lily that sunlight can destroy him. They get to work setting a trap. They position several large plates to reflect the sunlight at Darkness when the time comes. Darkness and Lily prepare for the ceremony to destroy the unicorn. Gump tells Jack to shoot Lily with an arrow before she can kill the unicorn. Jack hesitates and still believes she is good despite her appearance. Gump did say judge her with your heart and not your eyes. Indeed Lily does prove Jack right and she strikes the chains instead freeing the unicorn. Darkness strikes her in the face and knocks her unconscious. Take notice that Gump's bow was still drawn on her hinting that she is no longer the innocent girl that Jack knew. Darkness goes for Jack and a swordfight ensures. Jack realizes he is not physically a match for Darkness. He graps the cut off horn and stabs Darkness in the chest with it. Gump and the others direct the sunlight on him while he is wounded and he falls into the dark void. Jack returns the horn to the unicorn and all is right with the world again. Of note is that even though Jack was the hero of the story, it was really about Lily's journey. She was the one who fell to temptation not once but twice. First when she touched the unicorn and second when she allowed Darkness to seduce her. Lily has confronted her dark side and at this point we don't know if she may or may not be changed beyond redemption. It's only when we see her free the unicorn that we see she still has good in her. Prior to that we didn't know what her intentions were. In the end Ridley Scott shows good overcoming evil not by rejecting it but by overcoming it. While it's true that Lily has been touched by the dark side, her heart remains pure. She is now a woman. Her experience will serve her well in the future. The Lily who outsmarted the son of the devil will make a much better queen than the Lily who thought no harm could come to her if her intentions were pure. The question is will Jack still love her even though the Lily he knew is gone? In her place is a more mature and stronger Lily. And quite a beautiful one at that.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|For months I've had trouble shaking up on time. I had even resorted to multiple alarms. I saw this app for free on Amazon so I tried it for fun and it has totally changed my mornings. I actually wake up on time and even earlier when I need to. THANK YOU!
B0013FSL0C|5.0|\\"In Treatment\\" is riveting television.  The series' first season will never be surpassed, a point that can be made more definitively now that HBO has declared a quasi-end to the show after the third season.  [There was announcement of an end followed by some waffling by HBO, so who knows at this point.]<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne is the engine that makes this show work.  His role of Paul Weston calls for long stretches of silence and active - almost aggressive - listening.  Then, when he talks, his words are sparse and impactful.  His understated delivery gives his observations a powerful punch.  Not everyone can pull this feat of minimalism off.  Gabriel Byrne can.  His casting is a masterstroke.<br /><br />Season 1 provided us with one breakout star: Mia Wasikowska.  She's simply amazing as Sophie a young suicidal gymnast.  Those of us who caught Ms. Wasikowska here feel like we were in on a secret.  The rest of the world's caught on now.<br /><br />I also relished the episodes with Embeth Davidtz (always a personal favorite) and Josh Charles (his 'Jake' here is a marked change from The Good Wife's Will Gardner) as well as those with Blair Underwood.  I always joke that Blair Underwood does Blair Underwood very well, but he opened my eyes here with some truly fine acting.<br /><br />Melissa George's Laura episodes left me a bit cold and uncomfortable, and I simply never cottoned at all to Paul's sessions with Gina (Dianne Wiest) - they're just so combative.  However, I do like Michelle Forbes and felt like she was underused as Paul's wife, Kate.  I would have had more Kate, less Gina.<br /><br />I'm fascinated by In Treatment's heritage as the Israeli show Be'Tipul ([[ASIN:B001QWX850 In Treatment (Be'Tipul) - The Complete First Season (Hebrew)]]).  I wish I could get an English subtitled Region 1 DVD of that.  Ayelet Zurer (The Ice Princess) and Lior Ashkenazi are two of my favorite actors.  They're the Laura and Alex equivalents in the original.  That kind of thing thrills me to know.
B003FSTN6Q|3.0|I love the Ghost Whisperer, I own all five seasons, and after viewing the fifth season on DVD I remembered why I missed a lot of the eps of this season on TV.  The romance between Jim and Melinda is just GONE, I mean they act like roommates and are hardly affectionate with each other.  He is actually downright RUDE to her on at least one occasion when he is frustrated over the ghost stuff, it's such a total shift from the first four seasons.  I did not mind the addition of their son, he was cute and brought some interesting story lines, but with Jim and Melinda being so completely out of sync my attention just wandered.  I also didn't really care for Jamie Kennedy, I can't even remember his character's name.  As an actor he did a fine job, but first they got rid of Andrea, who I just LOVED, and then they got rid of Professor Payne...he was hilarious and SO inappropriate sometimes, and they replaced him with Jamie...who was just okay.  The character did nothing for the show IMO.  Delia was also just an okay character.  So basically the removed all the excitement and spark from the show for me, and with Melinda being the only interesting person left on the show, I can see why it went off the air.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|A lot of people gave this show some harsh reviews, primarily nerds like myself that read the comics, but I'm here to say that the show, I thought, was great. I liked seeing a different story because I didn't know  what was coming next. If it was too exact it would have been boring. Anyway the characters are great and the show was awesome and Blu-ray just makes it that much better. Enjoy.

B0001I55SS|4.0|The Black Hole(1979) was Walt Disney Pictures' attempt at cashing in on the success of Star Wars(1977). The Black Hole was also the first Disney movie to get a PG rating from the MPAA. A spaceship crew are trapped on a derelict space vessel run by a psychopath. Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens lend their voices to sympathetic robots. The Black Hole is visually stunning and it has nice art direction, but it also has some corny, comic book-style dialouge. The late, great John Barry composed an epic, sweeping, atmospheric music score for the film. Siskel and Ebert weren't impressed by this film, but it's still fun to watch.   Among the cast are Maximillian Schell, Anthony Perkins, Yvette Mimieux, Ernest Borgnine, and others. The Black Hole is one of the darkest films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I do not know how much more I could add that the nearly 1,000 other reviews have said, so I will give it a whirl.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is about the infamous Kvothe setting the record straight on many of the stories that spread about him. Kvothe's story is very interesting and fascinating. The setting is great, the pacing works well, there are plenty of characters to love, hate, and wonder about, and after the last page was through, I wanted more. So much more. While the magic system employed is somewhat vague in how to use it and how it works, it is not used as a gimmick and very much compliments the story. This book is well worth your time, effort, and any sleep you lose.<br /><br />A truly fascinating tale that feels like it is not long enough!
B004IQMXD4|1.0|I listened to all the audio samples and just couldn't find anything that really seemed to have any merit, as far as quality tracks. I will have to pass this time. Good luck, Stevie.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I had the pleasure of finish The Name of the Wind a week before The Wise Man's Fear came out, at which time the library was holding a copy for me to pick up and devour. This book is quite long, sitting at 1008 pages. It took me 10 days and countless hours of sleep lost to read it, and it was mostly worth it. Kvothe's fascinating and intriguing tale continues and takes you further into the past that turned a boy into a man into a modern day legend.<br /><br />For the most part, the pacing of The Wise Man's Fear moved swiftly, despite this book and The Name of the Wind covering only one year of Kvothe's past. This book suffers two lulls in the story that prevent me from giving it a five star review: Kvothe's time spent with the Fae, and later when he lived among the Ademre. 200 pages were focused on these two arcs and shortly after starting them, I was hoping to be done with them. The mythical Chandrian are given a little bit of attention, but after turning the last page, you are not left knowing much more than you did before, except their names. I suppose that is significant, given the story's attention to people's names, but it was a bit unsatisfying. A lot of people have suggested Kvothe was out of character during several monumental events, and I can see what they mean, but this did not bother me so much as the two arcs mentioned above. There was also a lot of sex going on with Kvothe, so much so that Kvothe seemed to have an unquenchable hunger no matter how many women he bedded.<br /><br />There were two other parts that bugged me. When Kvothe travels from Tarbean to Junpui, he goes from riches to rags, save for his lute and its case. The details of this misadventure were extremely brief in chapter 52. The information about the route he traveled was longer than the brief details provided. Kvothe's reasoning for not including any of this was because it had nothing to do with the heart of the story. Fast forward to chapter 141, and more time is given to a \\"delightfully uneventful\\" return. Granted it was one paragraph more, but this really annoyed me. His trip to Junpui sounded far more entertaining than the 70 pages with the Fae and 130 with the Ademre.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear is still an awesome read, even though it did not live up to the reputation The Name of the Wind presented. I am very eager to know where this story will go and how it will end. Aside from the retelling of Kvothe's life, there is the mysterious story to be told about his assistant, who I am guessing is a demon. It has been a few months, so I do not quite remember what he is, except that he is not human. This book is worth the read, even if there are some glaring issues and character inconsistencies.\\" return. Granted it was one paragraph more, but this really annoyed me.

0307477479|5.0|First things first: Jennifer Egan's \\"A visit from the goon squad\\" is great! Now that the truth is out, one can dig deeper, and find out more - eg, why it is great. To begin, many authors have been tried to capture the zeitgeist, the way we are and live right now - most of them fail, because they don't seem to give room between now and the future or the past. In this book - that is more a collection of interrelated stories rather than a novel - Egan is capable of talk about our ages using past and future.<br /><br />Music is the means and the end - the metaphor and the subject for creating and relating characters, events and actions. Sasha, Bennie, Dolly, and so many other characters breath life through the pages of \\"A visit from the goon squad\\". They seem to exist over the helm of fiction, they sound like real people, who we can meet walking in the streets - rather than characters created for `living' for 20 pages.<br /><br />Their lives and attitudes are what moves forward the plot of the stories - or chapters if you prefer. We are able to meet their pasts, their presents and futures - not necessarily in this order. Their connections, in the hands of a lesser writer, might sound farfetched, but Egan makes them organic: they meet, becomes friends (or not), becomes lovers (or just have an one-night stand), never meet again, kill themselves, meet other people, get married... the list is long and contains all the important events of the human experience.<br /><br />The style varies from story to story. Of course, the most talked about is the Powerpoint presentation (than can be seen and listened to in full color and sound and glory in the writer's official website). It is excellent because the form, in this case, is as important as the content - in other words, it makes sense to tell the story as Powerpoint slides. But as most people talk about this one, the other seem to be less good - which is not the truth. Egan's prose is strong and captivating - no matter if she is writing a Hollywood star profile or the fall of a PR dealing with a military dictator.<br /><br />The line that divides past, present and future is blurred and the events of one time reflects, interferes or changes another one. In Egan's book (as in life), we are the consequence of our past, and the essence of our future. The last story/chapter establishes a beautiful dialogue with Gary Shteyngart's \\"Super sad true love story\\" - and to tell more is to spoil the pleasure of reading both books.<br /><br />The Pulitzer Prize for fiction that the book received some weeks ago is more than deserved. \\"A visit from the goon squad\\" is what there is best in American Literature nowadays. It is inventive, it has an accurate view of our time and age, but above all, it is timeless because it has humanism at its core - it is about us, and this is a subject that never feels out of date.tar profile or the fall of a PR dealing with a military dictator.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|After a blisteringly beautiful intro, `The Diary of Alicia Keys' truly starts things off with `Karma', one of those singles that becomes instantly recognizable and infectious, even to someone who hasn't heard the song in quite a few years.  This sets a perfect tone for the album; one that hits a lot of great notes, scouring that piano for the right sound and in the process finds a few of them.  Sure, there are some lower points (some oddly dated sounding material) but overall, this album shines as brightly as the beautiful artist sitting behind those ivory keys.<br /><br />The Motown influences that wrap themselves around `Heartburn' are certainly welcome, adding so much color and spunk to this track.  It may (MAY) be my favorite track on the album.  It is just so infectious and likable.  The medley is a form of music that I normally cannot stand, but `If I Was Your Woman/Walk Away' works brilliantly, with dueling musical arrangements that are stellar compliments.  We have all heard the beautiful ballad, `If I Ain't Got You', and it still stands up today.  The message is so genuine, and the way that Alicia sings so tenderly over a simple yet powerful melody works such magic on this record.  It showcases Keys' major talent and has the power to send shivers.  She follows that track up with `Diary', a beautifully sung ballad that follows a similar formula; simple yet moving.  The track remains mostly mellow until the finale, where it reaches heights pristine quality.  `Wake Up' bounces in all the right places (Ah-oop), and maintains a sweetly effective vibe that makes me smile.<br /><br />And then she hits me with the best thing on this album.  Yes, I know I said that `Heartburn' may be my favorite song (it's just so fun), but there is no denying that the award for BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM is easily handed over to `When You Really Love Someone'.  Keys just lays it all out there, delivering such a brilliantly layered ballad that is up-tempo enough to get your heart beating in perfect harmony with those bass lines; and that chorus is just insanely catchy.<br /><br />Some tracks, like `You Don't Know My Name' and `Slow Down', are very good songs yet they feel slightly dated; very 90's.  `Dragon Days' has moments of greatness, and then it kind of feels slightly campy in others; I'm torn.  `So Simple' is kind of a mess.  It just doesn't work, especially that chipmunk-like chorus collaboration.  That squeaky voice thing only works on certain songs, and this is not one of them.  I also wasn't too keen on `Samsonite Man', a track that wasn't bad but just felt like forgettable filler to me.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty great effort on Alicia's part.  The majority of the album is top notch, and even the songs that don't quite reach those heights are still `good' songs.  Nothing is bad here, nothing demands to be skipped.  `The Diary of Alicia Keys' is a pretty interesting read, err, I mean `listen'.rmony with those bass lines; and that chorus is just insanely catchy.

B004SEUJNM|3.0|I don't know why they did what they did with this version of the film. The transfer is great. The booklet is great. What happened to extras? NO extras AT ALL. I didn't realize it until I got it home. I love the booklet stuff they do, especially Warner because they don't do it cheap (300, Shawshank, Dr. Zhivago) but these 20th Century Fox/MGM are a bit on the cheap (Quite smaller than the WB's). But no extras should make this a $7 item. That is the reason for 3 stars; small booklet and no extras. I would pass on this high $ item until it drops, if you are a Sly fan! I got it for $14.
0345522478|5.0|I don't think I've enjoyed an urban fantasy this much since the first time I picked up one of the Dresden Files.  Hounded is a fast, fun read just chocked full of Celtic lore and great characters.  I was a bit hesitant when first confronted with these Celtic names and the wide variety of gods and goddesses, and I wondered how I would ever keep them straight. Thanks to the author for giving us a pronunciation guide!  He has written the story with a skill that allows the reader to dip into these intricate mythologies just enough to enjoy all the fast paced action and to revel in the wit and humor that is bound to ensue when gods deign to mix with mere mortals (and druids).<br /><br />Atticus is a fine lead character.  I enjoyed his mix of 21st century slang and Shakespeare quotes.  Any man who can talk to his dog, run his own bookstore and still manage to slay some demon a** is a winner in my book.  He's fun to read and the author mixes in just enough sex to give things a bit of a sizzle.  This is a well told story that any fan of The Dresden Files or Repairman Jack will simply love.  I've already pre-ordered the next one and can't wait to see what walks through Atticus' door in the next volume.  Recommended.

B00006JMQG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, still mind-blowing today despite the fact that it was made in the first decade of the 20th century. It is renowned for its expressionistic images which, of course, retain their power to shock and to keep the viewer disoriented...but the overall script is a pretty sophisticated affair, too. The restoration is excellent, making this DVD a must-have for film buffs.

If you are looking at this book on amazon you are most probably a person who will appreciate it for the treasure it is!  Yes, the price is more than many cake decorating books, but this book is worth every penny and then some!  It is a massive book, very high quality in it's presentation and visual appeal........ This is not a cheaply assembled and thrown together book.  The content is so priceless, not to be found anywhere else in the books that are generally out there.  And the wonderful thing is the thoroughness, and the endless tips and advise to help as you work your way through this book!  And yes, you will want to try every design and technique here, they are all that gorgeous and that special!  The gorgeous full page photos show all the detail and specifics!  I really wish they let us \\"look inside\\" this one here on amazon......it would show this to be the absolute treasure that it truly is!

This is a collection that has so much footage, so much music on it..it is insane! It's a great, great collectors item especially for the price and he was definitely a very happy person when he received it on his birthday.

I liked the book and had trouble putting it down near the end.    I am looking forward to another installment and I have to go read the first two books.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This movie was crazy and it will remind you of a V.C Andrews Book for anyone who might be a fan?  There are tons of masturbation/sexual scenes.... did we really have to see that?  Portman is completely psycho in this movie and it hurts just to watch her.  Mila is cunning and annoying, I just wanted to slap her. I blame her mother for turning her daughter into such a psychotic head case.  I definitely recommend. This movie was also pretty scary. Her hallucinations will freak you out. So be prepared. Then again I watched this movie with headphones on, in the middle of the night with the volume turned up. :)

B004TTMYQG|5.0|I have to say that I was totally happy with the stock calendar on my Captivate. It wasn't anything special but it synced with my google calendar and that was all I really needed.     Since I downloaded Business Calendar I can't believe how much better it is! The appearance reminds me of google calendar and it has a lot of nice features. Dragging a finger over a group of days in month view zooms in on those days so you can see what is scheduled. This feature alone is worth the price for me. I can see that I have someone visiting from out of town for 3 days next week so I drag my finger over those days and it zooms in, pushing everything else out of the way. The events I care about are front and center and I don't have to be bothered with unrelated days.     If you need a good phone calendar you will like this one.

0756404738|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss picks up right where he left off with The Name of The Wind and has created another quick moving tale following our hero Kvothe in this fantastic sequel.  Don't be afraid of the length of the book as I found it hard to put down and was wanting more as soon I finished.  Some have commented that the story sort of starts and stops, but I never found that to be the case.  There is a lot more introspection and character development sprinkled in-between some great action sequences that make you want to just keep reading and reading.  If you were a fan of the first book you definitely won't be disappointed here!    This series is kind of like Harry Potter only with more edge and depth, so if you're looking for something similar with a twinge of dark that does not always a sanitized, happy ending, this is the perfect set of books to jump in to.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|This book, much like the Imperfectionists by Tom Rachman, is told through a series of short stories starring characters from previous chapters.  Enjoyment of the book is based  purely on whether or not you can relate to the protagonist the chapter you're reading.  The kleptomaniac, Sasha, kind of anchors the book, she opens the book and shows up in snippets throughout the book.  Each story on it's own is meh, but they all come together like a tapestry, a very sad tapestry that focuses on failure and lost chances and unfulfilled potential and guilt.  Ms. Egan has written a beautiful book that managed to make me question my own life.  Am I happy?  Am I successful?  Could I be doing more to become more successful?  Could I be doing less to become more me?  Kudos to Jennifer Eagan for winning the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  Well deserved.

B00026WU7I|5.0|The man sounds as if he's already on the way to his retreat in the mountains, or Tangier, or Italy for that matter. The marriage has gone broke and now all is full of knowing sighs. Even when the Idiot Wind blows, it sweeps himself away in the end. No use trying to outwit one's feelings; the truth is that she made him lonesome when she went. \\"Life is sad/Life is a bust/All ya can do is do what you must/You do what you must do and ya do it well/I'll do it for you, honey baby, can't you tell?\\" That's as direct as he ever got.
B0018B1O7I|4.0|I agree with the other reviews that speak to the mastering and correction of the speed issue. Having been familiar with album since 1966, it was a first a bit jarring, but quickly resolved into greater appreciation of the material.     Like other reviews, I was severely disappointed with the inclusion of the SP version of Light My Fire, and this mislabeled as \\"LP Version\\". Remembering the first time (when I bought the LP) I heard the true LP version, I was looking forward to hearing it in its remastered glory.     Like I'm sure many others did, I've gone back and also downloaded a true LP Version of the song and re-sequenced the listings for my own use. Also like many others, I think it would be just of Amazon to at least give those who have had to do as did I a $.99 refund. For those who didn't download the extra (and correct) version of the song, Amazon should offer them the download for free.

It wasn't until the very last scene did I understand , and put it together  that is,some of those unanswered questions about some of those scenes that you go ..huh?  Watch it to the end, and you'll know exactly how things ended up, well,   you'll be able to reason what the future holds for her and why.  A humaness that dictates the end makes this one of the most bizarrest flicks I've ever seen,  and I'm not kidding you.    I wish I can say more.Just stick with it, and maybe you'll understand  the end and maybe you won't.  This movie will be on MY mind for quite sometime.
0810989956|5.0|Like virtually every other kid on the planet, my 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter both LOVE the Wimpy Kid series by Jeff Kinney. My son hates art - hates it - so I didn't think he'd like the Do-it-Yourself version. I was so wrong. Not only does he love it, but he'll sit for ages trying to draw a \\"just right\\" picture. When he's not around, I'll catch my daughter sneaking the book to her bedroom (I am NOT making this up). When she sees me, she says, \\"I'll just do one. He won't like this one, Mom, I promise.\\" It's adorable. I plan to buy her one of her own.<br /><br />If your kids are on the Wimpy Kid bandwagon, don't pass this one up. It still has lots of reading, but it has plenty of writing/drawing opportunities that will hook even art haters.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I recommend this CD. The movie and this accompanying sound track were a great way for me to find my way back to country music.
0307595862|5.0|One of the finest Scandinavian policemen, Harry Hole, is back is this new release from Nesbo.<br /><br />During the first snow of the season in Oslo, a young boy wakes up to find his mother has disappeared.  Outside of his window there is a new snowman wearing his mother's scarf.  Harry Hole and Katrine Bratt are investigating the disappearance when another woman goes missing during a new snowfall, and again, a snowman suddenly appears.  But this time, the killer has added part of the woman's body to his icy sculpture.<br /><br />Harry received a strange letter months earlier that made reference to snowmen and a serial killer from early in his career.  He realizes that the anonymous letter is connected to these new murders but he doesn't yet know what the connection is.  As the investigation and murders continue, it's apparent that the killer is taunting Harry personally.  With his bosses and the press breathing down his neck, the race is on to find the killer.<br /><br />Nesbo continues to paint Hole as an intelligent and intuitive investigator, but at the same time a lonely and damaged man.  Harry still struggles with his drinking problem and his relationship with Rakel is all but over.  She has moved on, but Harry is having trouble letting go, in part because of the sexual tension between them.<br /><br />Darker than Nesbo's previous novels, THE SNOWMAN is a stunning and complex mystery that deserves to go to the top of your reading list.  Lynn Kimmerle
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I was leery about buying this book even with all the glowing reviews but was not disappointed.  From start to finish (4:30AM )I was captivated.  Looking forward to sequel
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This series is a stunning work of art.  Watching the whole series again on Blue Ray is very satisying as the video and audio quality is stunning. Especially the special effects scenes, since they are digital creations.  Commentary on Exodus: Agathon and Adama mistakenly refer to vipers as \\"planes\\" (like airplanes????!). Overall, well worth the purchase.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I have two sons becoming Navy SEALS and they, no we, have watched the series multiple times together and read now this book. I was not disappointed. It opened my eyes to the desire of men to be a part of something greater than themselves even though the pain and effects are lifelong. I admire these men who became brothers and in some part wish I had been a part. I watch the gleam in my sons eyes to enjoy somewhat of this in their lives. Thank God for men who were willing to shoulder liberty for us. But it continues today and my sons will learn it too. Thanks for the help Stephen Ambrose. And thanks for the sacrifice in reality men of the Band of Brothers.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I have not heard a new album quite like this before. Right away, that's a bonus. Their folk sound is one rarely heard in today's music. Aside from that, their lyrics are very powerful and touching. Marcus Mumford's rustic yet melancholy voice adds emotion in every word, including anger, sadness, forgiveness, and strength.
0811879542|5.0|The first time I prepared to read the book to a class it was checked out by an upper  grade student when I wasn't looking.  Finally today it was back and so I read it to a class of kindergartners.  I asked one boy to come up to help me.  Although I enjoyed the book on my own it was seeing it through 5 and 6 year-old eyes that made me really appreciate it's brilliance.  They loved it. They laughed and begged for more.  Recommended for everyone!  Update: now sharing it in the school library I was transfered to.  As I read it to a class of second graders, mostly ELL's, the teacher walked in and one students said \\"look, it's a magic book!\\"
B000SEIK2S|4.0|War and tech stuff is cool, plus the characters are interesting.    Overall, a good book. But not great. Here's why it's not great:    1. He skips chunks of what could have been interesting, and then shifts out of first person perspective to omniscient and glazes over all the cool stuff we missed. This is VERY ANNOYING! I didn't realize this was what he was doing until I finished the third book.    2. He can't decide if this is a war book or not. This comes out when he starts skipping over stuff.    It's a good read, and pretty fast, and I ultimately liked the ending, but he needs to stop switching perspective after I finally get interested in something. And then glazing over it with a crappy recap. This series is good, but I won't pick up any more Scalzi books unless recommended by a friend.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I recently purchased the Plant Earth DVD series and I am wonderfully pleased.  The photography is excellent as expected and a absolute pleasure to watch. I am a 7th grade World Geography teacher and my students really love Planet Earth.  They continue to ask when will they get to watch more.  Its got to be really special to hold the attention of middle grade students for any length of time.  I purchased my set used but it looks in excellent condition.  I am very pleased with the product and the price.  If you enjoy beautiful photography and nature at its best you will love Planet Earth.
B000YPUF9W|2.0|What a missed opportunity one just about every level. After the first film (which was just OK) then the second, which is my favorite in the series, but still not a great flick, comes Resident Evil: Extinction. It's completely un-entertaining, if fact a stupid film. Zombies in jump suites using kung fu....give me a break!!!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|i love the coud player option, but would love to see a audible.com style share what i am listening to button. Hearing and seeng what others are listening to is a great way to find new music. i would love to share and see what others are sharng via twitter.
B000002LSV|4.0|THIS ALBUM Was ok; had a few songs I did not like but still worth being in my library
B004K4IZ54|4.0|Blu-Ray is definitely the medium of choice for this movie. the visuals and eye-candy in the movie more than make up for a hair-thin story. If you are a TRON fan, watch this. If you have no idea what TRON was, this movie may not make sense to you but watch it just the same. Loved the new light cycles and the overall feel of the visuals. The Daft Punk music score is another awesome highlight.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|At first I thought this movie was a little strange. Different from what I am used to. But I really enjoyed it. Great casting and acting. Gerard comes through again. So glad he decided to become an actor instead of a lawyer. Lol. He ROCKS!. So glad I bought this movie.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Having just finished a vacation trip to Italy and learning of Catholic Priests' efforts to help escaped Allied prisoners avoid the retreating Nazis, I searched to find a video depicting this historical event.  I ordered \\"Scarlet & Black\\" with Gregory Peck, updated on DVD and was extremely pleased to have the DVD arrive ahead of the projected delivery schedule and in excellent condition at a fair price. The video was a wonderful story probably overlooked by most people and we thoroughly enjoyed it and are loaning it to others in our family to view now too. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
B0001I55OC|4.0|The story was good but kind of slow sometimes. But it is the kind of movie I could watch again. Don't know if I could say that if Gerard Butler was not in it though. He makes the movie worthwhile for sure.
B002TG3C8A|5.0|\\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\"<br />We purchased Rammsteins special deluxe box set. Not only was it a fantastic price, but it shipped insanely quick!!!! we were going to the show in Edmonton Alberta, and our goal was to meet the guys and have them sign the box set....we did get to meet them and they did sign the box set, had this not arrived so incredibly fast we would have missed this opportunity....I cannot thank you enough!<br />Erin717
B00006JDVV|3.0|I would not have liked this movie so much if Gerard Butler had not been in it. As usual he made this movie watchable with his charm and talent. It was an 'alright movie'. I only bought it because I am collecting Gerard Butler's movies. But he was not in it as much as I would've liked.
B000002KLP|5.0|Years ago(1980 or 81')I went to NYC to see Saturday Night Live,as I recall Eddie Murphy was doing a stand up routine when he noticed Prince,Dez Dickerson,Dr.Fink and a few others sitting in the audience behind us. He called them to the stage and they broke into a fiery version of \\"Uptown\\" when the song was done the band \\"slammed\\" their instruments down and immediately walked of stage..it was a Rock\\"N\\"Roll moment! This is my introduction to the music of Dirty Mind.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Interesting puzzle kinda game.  Its fairly short (about under an hour long), not too difficult either.  I personally enjoyed it while it lasted.   For everyone that says it Forces Closes, the same happened to me on my Epic 4G.  All I had to do, was simply slide my keyboard open and start the game and voila!  When I close the keyboard at any time, it FC's though. (If you dont have a slide-out keyboard, maybe you can force your phone to display in landscape prior to running it) I hope that helps any FC errors and allows everyone to enjoy this game :-)
B0043M4OTE|2.0|First, I adore this series - I've been following it since my college years, and the short story collection was lovely. While, I agree that it was short, I did love the little encounters between the various characters (especially Alec's dad and Alec). The fanart was also lovely - lots of various styles and perspectives.   I would probably give this four stars, if not for...    Mostly, my problem is with the kindle edition (I couldn't wait for the delivery), and I was disappointed by the formatting problems. There were huge, awkward gaps between the text and the pictures - I couldn't tell if the written section had ended or what. Very crudely done.
B004G600A4|5.0|I'm very choosy, as a mother, what my children view on screen.  My 5 children (ages 4 - 15), along with my husband & I, viewed this movie together.  We all laughed at the funny parts, were on edge at the intense parts, and some of us even cried at the touching parts.  The movie was very well done and kid friendly while appealing to an adult audience, as well.  The only part I talked with my children about after it was over, was a remark Flynn made re: a little bit a rebellion being good.  My 14 year old actually picked up on that and knew that was not necessarily good.  The kids are quoting many of the funny (& appropriate) parts even weeks later.  Great movie! Way to go Disney!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This little app is so great!  I can actually get to verses quicker than those with a regular Bible.  I love the different versions available and the many Bible plans.  Such a wonderful little app!  The only problem I have is that it doesn't hold highlights.  You can highlight but the next time its gone.  Minor issue.  This won't replace my big Bible but when its not with me, I can still read and grow.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I bought this game for my 9 y.o. son for his birthday.  This quickly went from, \\"eh.. a board game\\" to \\"DAD!  This is the best present ever!\\"  There isn't a day that goes by the he doesn't want to play.  The rules are simple enough the my 6 y.o. plays and has fun.  The strategy is as simple or as complex as you can imagine.  Overall, a great buy!
B003UESJFG|4.0|Megamind (animation, action, comedy)<br />Directed by Tom McGrath<br />Starring the voices of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill<br /><br />DreamWorks   2010   96 min   Rated PG   Feb 25, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: Dolby TrueHD 7.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />Hollywood has made more than its fair share of superhero movies since Superman (1978) was released, but the genre remains one of the most popular. Viewers, especially in North America, enjoy recapturing childhood memories and seeing their heroes on the big screen. Most of the plots are predictable, but that doesn't detract from the fun.<br /><br />Megamind deviates from the traditional plot in the same way that Despicable Me did. We are asked to sympathize with the villain.<br /><br />The movie begins with Megamind (Ferrell) leaving his parents in a ship when his planet is on the verge of destruction. Does that sound familiar? References are made to Superman throughout the film. While this is happening, a child is sent to safety from another world close to destruction. The two children fall to Earth and experience very different childhoods. Megamind lands in a prison yard, while the other child falls to wealthy parents and grows up to be Metro Man (Pitt).<br /><br />Metro Man is squeaky clean and spends his time doing good deeds. He can fly and he's invulnerable. The city worships him. Megamind leaves jail and decides that he can't compete on those terms, so he decides to be bad. Metro Man is loved by the media and Roxanne Ritchi (Fey) is the reporter who plays the equivalent of Lois Lane in the story. Megamind decides to capture her to lure Metro Man into a trap. It works and Megamind discovers an apparent vulnerability in his rival, resulting in Metro man's death just 20 minutes into the movie.<br /><br />The city mourns the loss of its hero and Megamind begins his reign as an evil overlord with the help of his sidekick, Minion. It's hard to hear the name Minion without thinking of Despicable Me. This Minion looks like a happy piranha balanced on the body of a robot. Some of the humor is left to our imagination. For instance, what kind of reaction would Minion get when he buys coffee and donuts to take home to Megamind?<br /><br />Both movies ask us to focus on the villain and see that they are not all bad. Megamind regrets the death of Metro Man and finds that he can't adjust to life without him. He functioned better when he had a natural enemy. To remedy the situation, he develops a gun designed to infuse its victim with special powers. He inadvertently shoots Roxanne's cameraman, Hal (Hill), and decides to groom him to replace Metro Man.<br /><br />Megamind has the ability to change shape for limited periods of time and that's the source of much of the humor. Hal is renamed Titan. Megamind gives him a costume and begins to school him while appearing as Jor-El and sounding like Marlon Brando. Titan isn't cut out to be a hero and struggles to learn. He eventually finds that he prefers using his powers for criminal purposes rather than for good. Megamind has created a monster.<br /><br />This is where the movie deviates from the expected path somewhat. Megamind is the only one who can stand up to Titan and so he starts to become the good guy. We root for him when he's battling Titan in scenes similar to those in The Incredible Hulk when Bruce Banner fights Emil Blonsky.<br /><br />There are a few more plot twists and I won't reveal them here, but the movie works. It's funny, fast-paced, and the action scenes are frequent. Megamind is a character with many frailties and we're allowed to see them. That's why we aredrawn in and made to care about the outcome. Ferrell is particularly good as the voice of Megamind, but none of the actors disappoint.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />Modern animation is well-suited to Blu-ray and usually results in flawless transfers, but Megamind falls short of a perfect rating. It looks good for the most part; colors are bright and detail is strong. However, on closer inspection, you'll find frequent aliasing. Whether it's in hair, buildings, escalators or fire escapes, you'll see it often. This causes a slight flickering which can be distracting at times. The other problem is not a fault of the transfer, but the source material. Compare Megamind to a Pixar title and you'll see what I mean. The image, particularly in the background, appears flatter and lacking in detail. It looks less realistic than something like Up. These quibbles aside, it's still a good-looking title.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The English: Dolby TrueHD 7.1 track does not disappoint. This is one of the better titles for showing off your sound system. There's a lot going on at all times and you'll find yourself completely immersed in the action. Ambient sounds are strong and well separated throughout. The soundtrack includes a number of driving rock songs and they sound great on this track.<br /><br />Special Features 4/5<br /><br />Audio Commentary with the director, producers and writers<br /><br />The Animator's Corner with a PiP track<br /><br />Comic Creator<br /><br />Behind the Mind<br /><br />Deleted Scene (1 minute)<br /><br />Meet the Cast of Megamind (9 minutes)<br /><br />Inside Megamind's Lair (7 minutes)<br /><br />AnimatorMan (2 minutes)<br /><br />You Can Draw Megamind (13 minutes)<br /><br />Mega Rap (1 minute)<br /><br />The Reign of Megamind: Video Comic Book<br /><br />Spot the Difference game<br /><br />Megamind: The Button of Doom - animated short (15 minutes)<br /><br />World of Dreamworks Animation<br /><br />Trivia Track<br /><br />Previews<br /><br />Megamind is an enjoyable romp with plenty of laughs.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|As the author notes, there are plenty of diet books utilizing the low-carb philosophy out there, in various forms, and in fact there have been for several hundred years.<br /><br />What is unique to me about this book is its focus on the science, and the rigorous yet open-minded approach that the author takes to his investigation.<br /><br />He has a very level-headed, down to earth writing style, and he seems to embody the very best of the scientific method -- a willingness to accept contrary data, and a curiosity to find the best solution that comports with science and experience.<br /><br />While not a diet book, it's impossible to read this book and not come away with a new approach to diet and fitness.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 is a must see and stepping stone to the much anticipated Deathly Hallows part2 (July 2011 release).  This movie is set at a slower pace than previous Harry Potter movies, and is not the typical Hogwarts setting.  For non book readers it might not be their favorite, until they see part2.  If you are a book reader I think it is a wonderful movie that was able to stay more true to the book than most of the previous movies.  Despite the fact that it is a bit slower moving, there is still action and adventure that will keep you on your toes.  Overall this movie is an excellent addition to the series, and I recommend it to anyone who is a lifelong fan or is new to the Harry Potter scene!
B004JVXTL8|1.0|I enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity but this movie is just a cash grab by filmmakers. There is nothing innovative in a way of story telling and the plot does not unfold until the last 30 minutes of the film. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie or if you're really bored  just watch the first PA.
0345529057|5.0|The product came just as described! Great price too compared to the electronic copy... you would think the paperbacks would be more expensive than the electronic copies but its way cheaper! Great read too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am an avid reader and very rarely do I read books more than once. I read this series twice in one month. I can't say enough about how entertaining it was. This is a must read for everyone!!
0440241901|5.0|I love this book and the way it describes the office life, the struggle and even dirty competition at work. I was moved when Jack shares his little secrets. Just a small point that I was not really convinced is somehow Jack manages to calm down so quickly after learning that his greatest secret is going public. Anyway, love has its own reasoning. I will read the book again and again!
B000286RKW|5.0|Great deal, great film, a classic, you will watch it over and over and over again....ray liotta's best film by far
B000A2WT7K|1.0|I totally forgot to review this awful purchase! It said it was a special edition - see that cover picture? I bought it for my boyfriend, who had the movie but not the special edition. The \\"special edition\\" cost significantly more than the regular edition, might I add. Well I got it in the mail, compared the two dvd's, and they were exactly the same. The cover was even like the regular edition, which is not the picture you see attached to this product on Amazon.<br /><br />Anyhow, I contacted the seller, who asked that I return the dvd for a refund (I also don't think I ever got that refund, but enough time passed where I just figured lesson learned, buyer beware, never again), but they did not reimburse me for shipping and made me pay for shipping it back.<br /><br />Again - BUYER BEWARE
B004RC8NXI|1.0|awful, raunchy, and a waste of time. I thought it would be a funny film. But should be thrown in the trash. I would give it a 1/2 star if that was a choice.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Not good as a horror film, not good as a story, not good as a theatrical music piece.<br /><br />A well polished turd.<br /><br />I will compliment this movie on the musical score it was very nice.<br />I will also compliment on the adaptation of Swan lake that was also nice.<br /><br />However... the story couldn't be more awful. A girl with an over obsessive mother becomes a black swan once she releases her sexual frustration? How raunchy can you get? This isn't even a movie about a love story. It's like someone had an idea for a skimpy movie about a good girl gone bad and tried to sugar coat it by dipping it into the theatrical arts. What you get are the good pieces of the adaption of swan lake and the bad pieces the story of this freaking movie. The end result is this crap. Potential to turn this movie into something great was very high. Too bad they missed every step on this one.<br /><br />and no I'm not upset I watched this thinking it was a horror movie...<br /><br />I'm upset because I watched this and got a movie that didn't have a good story.<br />This coming from a guy that usually likes these awkward types of movies (see my other reviews). I can't stand \\"raunchy\\" films like this where they expect you to take it seriously. It's not even tasteful and it disgraces the beauty of performance.<br /><br />I can sum this movie up in one sentence:<br /><br />\\"You want to be a good dancer? Have sex with either men,women,or yourself\\"<br />Because that's all this movie is about.
1416955070|3.0|I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this book, and It's been one that I have picked up countless times, but never could bring myself to buy. I had heard that it was a rip off of Harry Potter and Twilight, and Cassandra Clare wrote HP fan fiction and is a wannabe J. K. Rowling, blah blah blah.     I ended up getting the audio version on Audible., and after two weeks of starting and stopping, I finally got into the story. Mainly because the narrator's voice got on my nerves the first few chapters, also the teenage slang Clare used was a way to much (and I'm 18). It was kind of like listening to your parents mimick you talking, using all the out of date words that were cool when they were young.     As I got into it though, I surprisingly found myself enjoying it. Sure there were a lot of similarities to Twilight and HP, but I decided that I was going to pretend that I had never read all those bad reviews and just enjoy the book.     It was predictable, and at times cheesy, but I liked it. It wasn't amazing, and it wasn't terrible. It was just okay. Nothing to really get excited over.     I loved the character of Simon and Jace, though. Right off the bat, Clare starts a love triangle that I am curious to see how it plays out. Especially after reading the ending.     Clare has twisted since of humor, and I loved that she made me laugh out loud at Jace's sour attitude or something Simon did. It was very entertaining in the sarcastic comments department.     Overall? I'll be reading the rest of the series. It won't blow your socks off, but it will entertain you for a few hours. I give it a thumbs up.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|It came in and wouldn't play; so they were supposed to send me a good one and I've not heard back from him in about 2 wks; I really would like the replacement, and to be able to send the original one back to them....at least I can usually get an answer by email. np

I haven't utilized the charging feature yet, as I mainly use this for playing 20 minute TV episodes for my child.

B002IRYYE6|1.0|As has been stated several times before, the Audio Fidelity gold disc is a complete train wreck. The phone ring from \\"The Phone Call\\" is missing (but that was allegedly not on the English master, so it can't be blamed on the mastering engineer), and the ridiculous overuse of compression is unconscionable. As usual when he botches a project, Steve Hoffman disowns the mess and blames it on someone or something else. But this isn't a personal attack; it's a criticism of this particular Audio Fidelity CD. Everything--voices, instruments, effects-- congeal into a sonic ball, with no separation or air whatsoever. To my ears, it's bordering on MP3 quality, it's that bad.The two-disc Rhino remaster is FAR superior: much more open and natural sounding. It's what the Audio Fidelity should've sounded like. It's a shame, because \\"The Pretenders\\" has always deserved first-class treatment as one of the most important rock records of the last 30 years, and I really thought the AF disc was gonna be IT. Unfortunately, it turned out a complete disaster, and I place the blame squarely at the foot of the guru himself, Mr. Steve Hoffman. If he knew the tapes were allegedly such a mess, he should've backed out instead of disowning the project in public and making some cryptic remarks about it on his forum. If you're considering buying the AF gold disc, turn around and make haste. It's most definitely not worth your time!

B004RE29PO|5.0|Due to the review posted by the person who hadn't actually yet purchased the blu-ray to confirm his concerns, I am posting this very quick review to assure buyers that the [[ASIN:B004RE29PO Aliens [Blu-ray]]] product has BOTH the theatrical release, and the 1991 special edition release with ALL the extra footage!  (Which is definitely the version of this film that you want to watch).    I saw this film 5 times in the theater when it was initially released.  I love this film.  It is a work of sci-fi / horror genius.  And I can also confirm that this is indeed the best this film has ever looked or sounded--on a par with, (or maybe even better than!) the quality of the theater experience.    No need to wait for a later special release of another Aliens Blu-ray version.  This is the one you want!
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|The inexplicable success of Stieg Larsson's mysteries is the best thing that has happened to Scandinavian writers since Selma Lagerl&ouml;f. Larsson's untimely death left a void that publishers are trying to fill desperately. Scandinavian names, long descriptions of cold weather and depictions of carnage in Sweden, Norway and Denmark are suddenly in vogue. Since many Americans are a bit confused on where Sweden is actually located, all European mystery authors are experiencing a surge of interest in their books.<br /><br />As you can see from the cover of Jo Nesbø's The Snowman, this author's publishers are doing all they can to milk Stieg Larsson's fame for all it is worth. This, however, is something that, in my opinion, this author doesn't need. This book is very good. Its only defect is that it is too drawn out. In his zeal to create as many twists to the plot as humanly possible, Jo Nesbø goes a bit too far and creates a 100 or so pages somewhere in the middle of this long book that feel quite redundant.<br /><br />If I had to compare Jo Nesbø's style of mystery writing to another author's, I would say he bears no similarity to the weirdly boring Stieg Larsson. Rather, Jo Nesbø is the Norwegian version of Michael Connelly. (Connelly apparently agrees and has published rave reviews of this writer's work.) Nesbø's protagonist called Harry (sic!) Hole is a police officer on a mission. He is also a lonely drunk and a die-hard romantic who gets treated badly by the woman he loves. Nesbø isn't nearly as good as Connelly in creating a complex and richly-layered protagonist. His Harry looks a little cartoonish at times. He is much better than Connelly, however, in writing the ending to his mystery. Connelly's endings tend to be much too abrupt. This gifted writer doesn't seem to realize that you cannot announce the culprit's name on the last page and just be done with it. The laws of the genre require that after the culmination there should be a winding-down period where the readers are offered an explanation of either what drove the murderer to commit the crimes or a description of the deductive process of the detective that resulted in solving the mystery. Nesbø's ending is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />The Snowman is a serial killer mystery. In the novel, Norwegians seem quite frustrated with the fact that they alone, of the three Scandinavian countries, have failed to produce a serial killer of their own. There are other cute moments in the book that have a very specific Norwegian flavor. See, for instance, the following passage that would have Ayn Rand die all over again were she around to read it:<br /><br />`It's a very small shop. We don't have many customers. Almost none until the Christmas sales, to be honest.'`How. . .?'`NORAD. They support shops and our suppliers as part of the government's trade programme with Third World countries. The message it sends is more important than money and short-sighted gain, isn't it.'<br /><br />This is, of course, a very dangerous game that the third richest country in the world (after Luxembourg and Qatar) is playing. Oil comes and goes while people who have been corrupted by such ridiculous handouts remain.<br /><br />There are some sparks of wisdom in this novel that I wanted to share with you. One of the characters says, for example: Our generation has turned itself into servants and secretaries of our children. . . There are so many appointments and birthdays and favorite foods and football sessions that it drives me insane.<br /><br />Anybody who has observed the frantic scrambling of the Western parents to organize endless play dates and activities for their children will have to agree with this observation.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book quite a bit and recommend it highly. Of course, it didn't hurt that snow was mentioned pretty much on every single page making this summer heat somewhat more bearable.rs are offered an explanation of either what drove the murderer to commit the crimes or a description of the deductive process of the detective that resulted in solving the mystery.

B000AXSN5G|4.0|I love this album by Neil Young. Why? It's because it represents Neil's signature folk sound, and is a little bolder than previous albums. In other words, this one has a little more pep, and will appeal to those who want songs that have more of a beat. On this one, you get it all: folk rock, some blues, and even horns. The title track has some brass in it, which was a surprise when first heard, but it seems to work well. I also want to point out that Neil Young has a knack for naming his albums effectively. While Prairie Wind isn't a sophisticated title, it nevertheless projects the image and ultimate feel of the album. I love all of Neil's acoustic folk albums, such as COMES A TIME, HARVEST, HARVEST MOON, SILVER AND GOLD, and of course this one. This album sort of takes a person back in time to when life was simpler. Just the fact that the front and back covers are in sepia says something. While this isn't Neil's best folk album, it is good nonetheless. I particularly like THE PAINTER, PRAIRIE WIND, THIS OLD GUITAR, and NO WONDER.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I got this because we loved Cranford and was hoping to find something longer with more modern characters that would still portray historical trends.  The minute we put it on, I knew it was going to be a major hit in our house and that we would all watch it many times.  The location, Oxfordshire, is undergoing big changes at the end of the 19C.  There is a village, Lark Rise, with many characters who are moving to the bigger city, Candleford, for work.<br /><br />The narrator is the cousin of the woman who runs the post office, which is a private enterprise of great social importance for the village.  The owner is a remarkable woman - one of those protean social hub types - who meddles in the affairs of others but is also stunningly clever and competent.  She is a spinster, but has much history in the town, including a youthful love affair with the current squire.  But there are many other vivid characters, including an angry moralist, a drunkard whose husband is always on voyage and yet she keeps having children, a stolidly eccentric delivery man, and two sisters who run the tailor shop and are almost always identically dressed.  Each character has much history behind them, which is slowly revealed during the season.<br /><br />This is a wonderful achievement and a treat for the eyes, for the mind, for humor's sake.  We will watch all 4 seasons.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I never really saw much of the show when it aired but what i did see was very very good. So when this one came up for sale I bought it, cause I knew I couldn't loose. You won't either enjoy.
0553805371|3.0|Not one of his best.  Just a \\"rehash\\" of physics.  It was OK, but I did not find much of interest inside.  A short book too.
0670022411|3.0|This book starts off great, it's a quick, entertaining read. It goes haywire in the middle, with too many details and overlapping stories that don't offer anything to the main story line. Finally, the ending does not answer any of the ongoing questions, or even set up a good sequel. I liked the main characters and wanted some resolution of their story. It just left me disappointed.
B000HWZ4CA|3.0|Still enjoyed the movie as much as ever; however, was not pleased with the sound quality as it faded in and out through the movie which did tend to be a distraction.
B001FB4W0M|3.0|I enjoy the series very much. I was disappointed in the quality of the season four blu-ray version. I have season three in dvd and the color and picture quality is better than season four blu-ray! amazing.
B003R0MF5I|4.0|As a series, Chuck has everything I am looking for in TV entertainment - a love story, character development, and excitement. This season was no exception, although it seems that the writers had a harder time writing it. There is some back-story that explains why this season isn't as strong as the first ones: apparently it was on the chopping block at NBC, despite the fact it was one of their strongest shows. The fans of this show are amazing though, and have brought it back for yet another season by means of a grass roots campaign for Subway and some of the other advertisers. I like to think that I played a tiny part of this, buy buying the DVDs for the first three seasons, preordering season 4, and writing a few emails to NBC executives. The possibility of a Season five was looking bad right up until the week that the final episode of season 4 aired - then NBC announce it would bring back Chuck for a fifth and final Season, and give it an ending that it deserved. I look forward to Season 5.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|This was one of the most enjoyable, entertaining and witty movies that I have seen in years. Woody Allen and I go back to Bananas, and this is by far his best. See it, rent it, buy it. And if you dont love it, i will refund your money.
141690977X|1.0|The book overall had a few good points. Obviously, it was written for a certain type of woman, the woman who is in a dead end relationship, the woman who wants more from the guy she is dating than what he is willing or able to give, the woman dating a man with commitment issues, or some type of issue that keeps him from devoting himself to her and prioritizing her.     Obviously, this book is not meant for ALL women, as some women are more independent than others, and some women have already figured out how to only date guys who are into them, and do more of the controlling in relationships because of that. Not all of us are hanging around dudes who only put in half the effort we want them to.    That being said, the book does have a few good points : If a guy is too lazy, doesn't want to, or can't be bothered with calling when he says he will, doing what he tells you he will do, calling you and keeping in touch after sex, calling you as frequently as you would like, wanting to meet your family and for you to meet his, making dates with you, asking you out, etc, then he isnt worth all the analyzing and overthinking.    All those are good, healthy, common sense points that are easy to forget when one finds herself in love with a bloke who doesn't return the favor.    What I don't understand, is why Greg has to throw in such insulting, sexist comments. WHy does self help for women have to treat us like we are stupid, talk down to us like we are idiots?    Greg says that we are supposed to look pretty and let men do the choosing. Greg says that we shouldn't expect guys to change, because they are \\"just guys\\" Obviously you don't want to wait around for someone to change, because people rarely do, but I think the \\"I'm just a guy\\" excuse is something that men use to get away with some pretty atrocious behavior.    Why does it have to be dripping with so much sexism? Women can pick too, it isn't just up to us to look pretty, please men and let them pick us. THey need to look good for us, show up and make and effort for us, and let us pick them, too. isn't that what the book should be about??
B000002KIK|4.0|Never Say Die (1978) marked the end of the Ozzy era of Black Sabbath. The band would boldly move forward and record with Ronnie James Dio and produce a fine first album with him (Heaven and Hell). When listening to this album, however, one can clearly see (and hear) the cracks in the machine. However, this album isn't without some very good songs. My personal favorite is Junior's Eyes, which has a nifty guitar solo in the middle and is raw heavy metal at its finest. I also like Over to You, which has a similar sound. Air Dance is an unusual number, and I can remember my nephew rolling around in the snow on a cold night while listening to this one (long story). I've always wondered how and why Iommi went with a most unusual guitar sound with this album. It almost sounds garage-like. Still, it's unique, and overall I think the album works. It's certainly not vintage Sabbath, but can hold its own nevertheless.
0670022411|2.0|This review is not about to tell you this is the worst book ever written. It is not. In fact, the book contains a plethora of richly described scenes that make visualizing the action and settings remarkably easy. However, a very promising book that starts out strong and original devolves into a sappy Mary Jane driven plot complete with sappy soul mate love story. Nothing against soul mate love stories but this one robbed several strongly developed characters of their integrity. The romance plot seemed to have several characters' personalities doing a 180 in the wrong direction. Still, the way the history and mythology (real and fictional) were being woven together holds some interest for the storyline until the final chapters, when it just peters out to a predictable ending. Not the worst written book but a very disappointing read in the end.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Great movie, it was inspirational. This movie was the best real story movie i have ever watched. The story was interesting. This movie truly deserved the Oscar it won.
B0025KVLV0|4.0|Their contract was up.They didn't re-sign. End of story. But what a legacy! No matter HOW you MIX it!    My title is what McCartney said when asked about the White Album being too long and should have been cut down to a single, better record.    The Beatles songs are cemented into my own personal being just like all the things that happened to me along the way that make me who I am today.    And I'm talking about the first time I heard the song. Where I was, my age at the time, the whole life experience. It's as deep as my mother reading to me as a child.    It's the Beatles! Shut up!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This was a steal of a deal!  I have watched and enjoyed these blu ray movies over and over!  The ONLY downside is that there is no digital copy, but who is going to watch an ipod movie over seeing it on the blu ray tv screen anyway?  Great investment, no regrets!
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I'm probably going to get yelled at for this, but I find that a lot of the 1-star reviewers seem not to understand that this movie was all the things they hate it for ON PURPOSE. It was supposed to be over-the-top and campy. Michael Cera is the antihero. Asking questions like \\"How can this dweeb get such hot girls?\\" is just as ridiculous as asking how quarters fell from the sky when the villians were killed. This was SUCH an uber-hipster movie. And as I'm sure everyone knows, hipsters do it ironically. That's why Scott wore that ZERO shirt and that's why all the girls looked like comic book characters...because they were. This is not a film to be taken seriously. It's a silly little comedy and I find that its viewers shouldn't try to make anything more out of it than what it is. I took off a star because I didn't think it had ENOUGH funny dialogue. Certain fight scenes seemed to drag on too long without any funny lines to fill up the lull. Also, the camera angles sometimes made me dizzy. I loved the retro video game feel, though. A solid 4/5.    UPDATE: I just got the Blu-Ray/DVD in the mail and when I tried to redeem the digital copy it said the code expired. So I looked in the DVD insert and in really teeny tiny writing down at the bottom it says \\"code may not work after 4/30.\\" It doesn't say this anywhere on the item details page. It didn't work for iTunes so I'm now trying it for Windows Media Player (when you try to redeem the code, they ask you to choose a player). I'll update further with whether or not it went through.
B0042L78MG|5.0|Wow!  What fun it was to listen to this album.  Caro brings a fresh wind to the Jazz vocal scene and somehow manages to make it sound like it came from yesteryear.  The lyrics are fresh, nothing from the \\"Jazz Standards\\" book here, and the rhythms are catchy.  I don't think you can go wrong getting this album so go ahead, you're ears will thank you.

B000SEGUDE|3.0|I was astonished to discover that this version of Cloud Atlas is CENSORED, with numerous swear words as innocuous as d___n edited out of the text. This is absurd. I neither need nor want Amazon deciding what is and is not appropriate for my little delicate sensibilities.  I wonder what Mitchell thought of this bowdlerized version of his elegant writing.    Unadvertised censorship aside, I am a great fan of Mitchell's prose with its rich vocabulary and witty, elegant phrasing.  I thoroughly enjoy his rich descriptions of southeast asian cultures, general insights into humanity, and storytelling ability. Cloud Atlas is no exception.

B000042O1O|5.0|After the lacklustre 'Movement', New Order slowly began to incorporate electronc elements into their sound over the next few years. The end result is 'Power, Corruption and Lies'; their best, most focussed, and most consistent album.     Part of the reason for its classic status is that there's really something for everyone here. About half of the album is dominated by the icy electronica that characterised their smash hit 'Blue Monday' ('5-8-6', 'Your Silent Face', 'Ultraviolence', 'Ecstacy'), but there are also nods to their Joy Division past on 'We All Stand' and 'Leave Me Alone', and to their poppier future on 'Age of Consent' and 'The Village'. And the different moods on the album (warm, reflective, unsettling and even sinister) added a human element to a style that was often perceived to be emotionless and distant.    Most elements of the typical New Order sound were in place by now. Peter Hook's bass, played at the upper end of its register, takes the lead role. Gillian Gilbert's keyboards are now warm and inviting. Stephen Morris easily adapts his Krautrock-based Joy Division drumming into dance beats. And while Bernard Sumner wasn't the greatest singer in the world, he shows some variation in his vocals, at different times sounding wistful, detached or intense.     The best part of this album is its consistency, which you can't always say about New Order albums. No song sounds weak or out of place, and the musicianship and lyrics are some of the strongest in the New Order catalogue. The band sound confident and assured, which is a welcome sign after struggling for a few years to develop their own sound.     Quite simply, a classic of the era.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|When I saw the previews for this movie, I knew I had to see it.  Despite following in the footsteps of the other Karate Kid movies, it had something different.  After seeing it, I still feel the same way.  I liked it.<br /><br />Dre and his mother move to China when she is transferred for her job.  Right away Dre starts getting picked on by the local boys when they think he gets to close to a local girl.  Discouraged, and in the middle of getting beat up yet again, he is rescued by the maintenance man at the apartments who manages to fight five other people.  When tensions are raised, he takes on Dre and trains him to fight in a competition.  But there will be some fierce competition to overcome.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Jackie Chan: Mr. Han<br />Jaden Smith: Dre Parker<br />Taraji P. Henson: Sherry Parker<br />Wewen Han: Mei Ying<br />Zhenwei Wang: Cheng<br />Yu Rongguang: Master Li<br /><br />I think the characters were really well cast.  Jackie Chan especially did a great job.  Jaden was ok but he over acted in some parts I thought.  The rest of the characters were well done too, but they tended to go to the extremes as far as good, evil, etc.  Master Li was an especially evil character.  I did find Dre's mother a little annoying as well.<br /><br />I thought overall the premise of the movie was good.  It had some cultural issues revealed and handled them truthfully but gently as well.  I also like how they had Mr. Han teach Dre Kung fu.  The jacket thing was funny but useful at the same time.  There were some beautiful scenes in this movie as well.  I liked that there were many shots of China and the different things there.  The music was pretty good as well.  It was a mix between English and Chinese but there was always a good beat to it.<br /><br />Not too bad.  It can definitely stand up there with the other movies no problem.  If you liked the others, give this one a try.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011
0307272702|5.0|Excellent - clearly written - simple and effective. I will never starve myself or count calories again.  I will no longer spend hours on an elliptical machine or running in an effort to \\"burn calories\\". Instead, I \\"work out\\" now by doing what I love to do, what's fun, and only because it makes me happy and strong, not because I think it will help me be thin. My weight is normal and my health is fabulous, and I eat when I am hungry until I am full. I do not obsess over calorie content or if what I eat will lead to excess fat on my body. It won't. Because I simply don't eat grains and legumes (i.e. excess carbohydrates). I have never felt so liberated in my life. Truly a paradigm shifter.

0618918248|2.0|I'm finally getting around to reading a few books from the \\"new atheists\\". I really don't anticipate that they will rock my theistic boat, simply because the arguments for and against the existence of God are ancient and well worn. The battleground changes over time, but the debate is eventually reduced to old fundamentals in every case with which I am so far acquainted.<br /><br />In my view, Dawkins suffers from two weaknesses in The God Delusion.<br /><br />First, because he is viewing theology from the outside (and very insistently from the outside), he seems incapable of differentiating between its most rigorous thinkers and its kooks. Consequently we find him contending with a Watchtower pamphlet over the matter of irreducible complexity, and an obviously deranged letter from a vicious opponent commands as much focus as C.S. Lewis (perhaps more, since Dawkins adores an easy target). This tendency undermines his credibility severely among the initiated, who (unless he's only seeking applause from those who already agree with him by writing these books) I would assume he seeks to persuade. His horror at certain biblical passages is understandable and common. But his conclusions about what those passages represent to people today and how they are viewed and applied are wildly incorrect.<br /><br />The second weakness is that he seems to have no awareness of how severely his arrogance blinds him to nuance (although he does concede that, perhaps, Hitler was not a model Catholic). At least as articulated here, in Dawkins' view virtually all of those who believe in the existence of God are primitive idiots who have no curiosity about the universe, and who seek to halt scientific inquiry. That's demonstrably false. It's false today, as evidenced by the fact that Christian evolutionary scientists exist, and it has always been false, as evidenced by the advance of science, through the toil of theistic thinkers, over many thoroughly religious ages and periods. Dawkins also has some rather disappointing news for any of you who see love, beauty or a motive to sacrifice on behalf of others in the Christian concept of substitutionary atonement, all billion or more of you. It is barbaric, psychologically traumatic and repulsive, because he says so. That settles the matter. Next!<br /><br />It struck me as strange to hear Dawkins continually talking about religion as if it were some malevolent, independent force or disease foisted upon humanity, rather than (if we embrace his conclusions elsewhere about charity or considerateness) a product of natural selection that served, or serves, an evolutionary purpose. He might suggest that, now that we are sufficiently intelligent beings, we can recognize our tendency towards belief in gods as a liability and reject it. In other words, natural processes have brought us this far, but intelligent design will allow us to progress yet further.<br /><br />Speaking of that dangerous, misguided, evil concept called intelligent design: it must not be given so much as a single second of thoughtful consideration in the naturalistically orthodox Church of Dawkins. Its proponents are all stupid (or worse, creationists), and they have nothing to contribute to the discussion. At every intersection with rational modernity, they are always and everywhere shown to be bumbling fools. They confront every scientific difficulty with an immediate appeal to God, and suffer from an acute lack of desire to know anything more. I've actually read \\"Darwin's Black Box\\" by Michael Behe, and I found Dawkins' caricature to be almost weirdly off base. In my experience, intelligent design proponents are nothing more than scientists who find Mount Improbable a little too improbable. That's all. I don't think it's time to include this concept in every public school science curriculum, but is it a humanistic sin to discuss the merits of the idea?<br /><br />Interestingly, in the final chapter he abruptly drops the aggressive posture, and speaks with genuine humility and wonder about vast new discoveries at the vanguard of science. It's the most enjoyable chapter in the book.<br /><br />I believe that hostility is generally driven by fear, and Dawkins strikes me as a rather fearful person. In fact, he appears to suffer from a textbook case of prejudice. The result is a book that vilifies, that paints with broad brushes, that jumps to conclusions, and ultimately tells me far more about Richard Dawkins than about the alleged delusions of others., and speaks with genuine humility and wonder about vast new discoveries at the vanguard of science.

I highly recommend this book!  If you don't read any other books this year or the next make sure you read this one.  You won't regret it.
1594132054|5.0|I recieved my book in the time frame promised and I am very happy both with the book and the vendor I purchased it from!
0307266303|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It's extremely divergent, reading it a fairly quick span (3 days for me) I was able to keep up with the author... in reading. The running heroics in the book are quite extraordinary, but it did motivate me toward getting fit and running. I may not get back to marathon running conditioning again, but I found it motivational, informative and entertaining.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Foo Fighters opened their tour for Wasting Light in Tulsa, OK this past Tuesday. To be honest, I know Foo Fighters hits, but was kinda of not looking forward to the concert because I had not listened to Wasting Light yet. With me, very few songs do I connect with the first time. I was shocked how I just fell in love with it and had to run out and buy it. They played almost the entire album.  Any other recording for almost any other artist could not pull this off unless it was a true classic album (i.e. Roger Waters touring Dark Side of Moon). Look at the aisles at a venue if an artist says 'this is off our latest...\\" the line for the beer and bathrooms start growing if the song has not already been released in a single.  If you are a fan of rock, this is worth the purchase. If you are a fan of Foo Fighters, this is a must and find away to get to their concert supporting Wasting Light, you won't leave your seat.

Best all time and I usually hate remasters.<br /><br />Don't believe all the negative reviews here that come from a faction of an anti-MFSL internet forum that I will not honor by mentioning it's name.
B003UESJHE|2.0|After all the hype around this movie, I expected a lot more. It was little more than a story that could have been told by the History channel which would have had the same effect. I feel like I wasted those 2 hours of my life and I want them back. I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, I just think it was possibly the most over-rated movie in history.
1932100660|5.0|I am reading this book for the third time. It changed my health and life in a very positive way. I use less pills, lowered my weight, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Combined with the new movie, Forks over Knives, you can expect the meat and dairy industry to attack his theories aggressively, since he could seriously affect their bottom line. The USA ranks 38th in the world in longevity, with health care costs double any other country. Preventative medicine! What a concept. Would you believe that Humana, a for-profit insurance company, pays for all my costs of going to a local health club. Also they provide free prescriptions that are generic, as a part of Medicare part B and D. Guess they have figured out that if I am willing to exercise, they are better off financially. What if our federal and/or state government came to the same conclusion.  This book is very well written and profound.   P.S. Anybody that served in Vietnam during the war is entitled to VA benefits regardless of age, because of Agent Orange. Pesticides can be dangerous to your health.  P.S.S If you see the movie Food Inc, you will think twice about eating meat

0670022411|1.0|Unlike many other reviewers, I felt OK with the plot and pacing.  I would have even read the sequel(s) and recommended it to friends, but for one (HUGE) problem.  The male lead is very sexist, and the female lead only seems to love him more for it.  Some scenes were so demeaning toward women that I would get a physical, angry reaction.  Examples:    - When Matthew doesn't want Diana to move, he restrains her physically.  - His mother continues to instruct Diana to obey him, which Diana agrees to.  - At one point of anger, Matthew reminds Diana that the family is not a democracy, he is in charge, and she is to follow his       instructions without hesitation from now on.  - When war strategy meetings need to take place, Diana and all the other women are summarily dismissed from the room.    These are only a few examples - they come continuously throughout the story.  Of course, a heroine facing disrespect and sexism doesn't diminish a great book - but this lead female never seems to have any anger about how she's treated!  She is a modern, supposedly intelligent, capable, professional woman, who allows herself to be ordered around, left out of decision-making, and treated as a child.    I kept reading to the end, assuming two things.  First, that Diana would finally grow into her powers, show a little anger about her treatment, and demand a more equal relationship with Matthew.  She never does.  Second, that the book - although I knew it was part of a trilogy from the beginning - would have a clear ending unto itself.  Most books in series do, after all.  But not this one!  My advice?  Don't even start reading.

1936719010|4.0|\\"A work-in-progress generates its own energy field. You, the artist or entrepreneur, are pouring love into the work; you are suffusing it with passion and intention and hope. This is serious juju. The universe responds to this. It has no choice...\\" -- From Do the Work<br /><br />I've you've read Seth Godin's [[ASIN:1936719002 Poke the Box]], or even Pressfield's [[ASIN:0446691437 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]], you're pretty much getting the same stuff in Do the Work.<br /><br />It's good stuff, mind you...very inspirational. It will get your off your butt if you're slacking and not \\"making it so\\". Here are some gems illustrating the type of motivation you'll find in Do the Work:<br /><br />* \\"A home-run swing that results in a strikeout is better than a successful bunt or even a line-drive single.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Ignorance and arrogance are the artist and entrepreneur's indispensable allies.\\"<br /><br />* \\"A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It's only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Don't think. Act. We can always revise and revisit once we've acted. But we can accomplish nothing until we act.\\"<br /><br />However, if you're an Intiator like me--someone who's ballsy, passionate, innovative and productive--you may need something a little deeper. For example, here's a phrase from the book that echoes some of what Seth asserts: \\"Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.\\"<br /><br />When Seth, or Pressfield, start getting into \\"soul's evolution\\", that's when it all breaks down for me. You see, I'm a Mind/Body/Spirit author and expert, and the quest (and discovery) of meaning is one of my passions--especially helping others find it. For me, the world view above had steered me to much frustration, disappointment and even heartache.<br /><br />Or, rather, the lack of specificity as to what determines \\"importance\\" or \\"call to action\\". Now, I'm not being picky here, honest. It's just that I've discovered that The Resistance often disguises itself as a \\"creative mandate\\", a \\"productive should\\" or a \\"thing I must do\\".<br /><br />Just because you feel an urge, even an obsession, doesn't mean it's your \\"soul\\" (or even a \\"calling\\" to expand your soul's parameters). Why? Because The Resistance often hides itself in the goals, brass rings and expectations of others--tribe, country, family, religion, cultural mores, \\"the factory\\", etc.<br /><br />That's The Resistance, not the soul. And gauging importance doesn't necessarily come from a sense of urgency as much as a niggling sensation that won't go away. It's what we daydream about. What makes us excited. What makes us wonder, \\"What if...?\\"<br /><br />And that kind of soul-nourishing fun doesn't necessarily breed The Resistance or fear (though, admittedly, it can...especially if you're not used to taking risks or care too much about what others think).<br /><br />This distinction matters to me as an Initiator, because I often have many opportunities to \\"Do the Work\\"; my challenge is to pick only a few so I don't get burned out. So advice like \\"do it, do it, do it...push through\\" are worse than just counterproductive for me, personally.<br /><br />So with that caveat, if you enjoy Pressfield's work, or Seth Godin's, then by all means get Do the Work. You'll likely feel a shot in the arm that comes from someone \\"understanding\\" you, or cheering you on to Initiate, Risk, Act and Produce.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the movie, I went back and finished the series. As escape fiction, it rates a one-star rating for me. As a commentary on the world where The Capitol is us, it was very well done. We are killing our children as violently as the people in the series are doing. Abortion is excruciatingly painful for the child. If you don't believe me, watch an ultrasound of an abortion.<br /><br />We can be like the people of the Capitol and happily enjoy our lives of excess or we can stop and look at the world around us. There isn't much we have inside the United States that isn't here because of someone else's suffering. So I am changing my one-star rating to a five-star rating. If THE HUNGER GAMES achieves an awareness of who and what we are doing, it was worth wading through all the horrific scenes.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|OK, well, the section on sex certainly benefits the woman. But the primary reason this book sells is its diet and really in MY opinion the eating plan is difficult for us ladies. I think it's wonderful for men, and both my hubby and I have been on it for 2 months or so. I HAVE lost some but he's lost more and loves every second of it. I start craving milk (we drink only whole, raw milk which is healthy and not bad for you like the homogenized, pastuerized garbage at stores). But I think I will continue a little longer until I'm down a full 15 pounds, my goal, and then I am going to start bringing milk back into my diet to see if I can maintain with milk but while keeping to the rest of it. I'll update here when I know more.
B002NHIK1E|5.0|LOVE it! And I'm talking from the  point of view of someone who does not like vampire shows or movies! New actors (I don't care how old they really are - they do a great job!), new plot (not that old-fashion vampire \\"scared of the cross, diabolical figure\\"), and hot guys and gals! My whole neighborhood and family watch it. I'm a science fiction lover, and the show \\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"Supernatural\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"is my favorite, but  The Vampire Diaries are now my second favorite!!! I have seen the actors off stage and they make a great team.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Not a heck of a lot to say that has not been said previously.  I LOVED this flick, being a child of the 80's and growing up identifying with every JOHN HUGHEs movie, I was instantly hooked.  Emma Stone is a natural in this role and I could watch this over and over.  This movie will become a cult classic.

I BOUGHT ALL SIX SEASONS AND WATCHED THEM IN 2 WEEKS!!!!!<br /><br />JARED AND JENSEN REALLY COULD BE BROTHERS IN REAL LIFE.

0307389839|3.0|I had mixed feelings about this book. It was interesting to me because I'm a distance runner as well, but I was turned off by the author at times. His training method seemed unorthodox and he believed a lot of myths about running. Like that you should try to run everyday, and like you should never walk in a marathon. He also talked about how he builds his endurance by a gradual increase of distance, this is not how you become faster. Running like most sports you improve faster, when you cycle your training not gradual increase. But he isn't a great runner and doesn't claim to be. He is just a runner who is very passionate about running and that shines through his writing. For what it is, it's almost like a unique look at a average runner who cares about \\"running\\" but not necessarily about getting the best time that he can.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I saw all the great reviews and decided to watch this movie and it was certainly worth my time. The movie was not only entertaining, but also very informative and educational.    This movie really brings to light the injustices and disservice that the US food industry (Tyson, Monsanto are some of the corporations named in this movie) is doing to our nation and our people. Throughout the movie, you see the fear and threats farmers and ranchers have to deal with from the food industry. You see how much of the food industry is controlled by a few big corporations, and how they have infiltrated our government and agencies such as the FDA. Food companies refuse to label food from cloned animals. The movie even tells of a story about a young kid who died because of E-coli in his hamburger meat. And we all thought that technology is supposed to improve our lives...    But there is hope. Ultimately, things are based on economics, and even corporations like Wal-Mart will respond to consumer demand for things like milk from cows not treated with rBST (growth hormone). Every time you purchase something from a grocery store, that's a vote from you telling the grocery store, and the food industry, what kind of food product you want.    I know I left a lot out of my review, I just want to say that you should watch this movie. :)
1402238843|3.0|While well-written with her usual witty characters, I didn't care for this novel as much as Heyers' many gems.  Like A Lady of Quality, the heroine is older, independent and protective of those in her charge (her younger, bookish brother who has a bad hip).  She falls for the \\"wicked Baron\\" next door and finds they have laughter and conversation in common.  Like A Lady of Quality, she flouts the advice of her relations, but this one didn't work for me.  By telling her relations that she doesn't care if her beloved rake is reformed and will accept his bad behavior, future affairs and mistresses, I think the author goes too far.  It is one thing to believe in the better qualities of a much-maligned man, it is another to praise destructive behavior.  I lost respect for the heroine at that point and couldn't root for her independent spirit because she was choosing an unhappy life over the advice of many who cared deeply for her.      I've noticed that Heyer novels change focus over her lifetime of writing and this novel may be seen as the pinnacle of her career, but I found it otherwise.  It reads like an experiment gone wrong to me.  I enjoyed the early part of their relationship and the heroine's determined efforts to dislodge her two local suitors, but the latter part of the book, when the lovers are parted, is just awful.  The \\"wicked baron's\\" noble determination to save our heroine from himself and her determination to condone his self-destructive lifestyle for herself both ring false and the novel just falls apart in my view.    Choose another Heyer - she is brilliant at capturing the period and the dialog is incredibly witty; but this one falls short on plot and character.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|This series does not play properly on our Blu-Ray player , the first time I've ever had a problem with my blu-ray. It starts fine but either locks up on the selection page or sometimes starts but the picture is garbled/broken up like its being filtered for some reason. However it plays fine for my wife in the bedroom on the HD DVD player so I'm only marking it down to 4 stars. Not sure if this defect is the norm or just on this one set. Otherwise it works fine and is a nice addition to our collection.
1416575464|5.0|This is a great and easy decor book. Very easy to read and not pretentious. It has great visuals and has lots of options for decorating your home. The categories are well divided and organized. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to decorate and/or renovate their home, or even to add a few new things to their rooms.

1596680296|5.0|This is an excellent book, comprising of all the basic skills required to knit top-down socks using a set of five double-pointed needles.    It includes clear instructions, colour pictures, a set of five basic patterns covering all foot sizes and most wool types, followed by more complex patterns for the experienced sock knitter.  I am thrilled to have just knitted my first sock, entirely via the guidance of this book. Highly recommended for the intermediate/advanced knitter!
B0009MAO46|5.0|I already had Toy Story 3 and figure I will eventually have all three.  Toy Story (aka Toy Story 1) was my second purchase of the trilogy, and I'm glad I bought it.  I had remembered it from the theatre, but I still enjoy watching it with my 3 1/2 year-old.
B004SC7B6M|4.0|Man, this was an incredibly hard review for me to write. In fact, I've been listening to The Unforgiving album for over a month now (maybe closer to a month and a half) and it's still tough for me to actually sit down and write this review. Even now, after probably 30 plus album listens, I'm still conflicted. This isn't the Within Temptation of previous albums, this is someone new, different, fresh and more mainstream. This isn't the WT I fell in love with, but could it be a completely new musical romance?     Let me back up a little bit, at least for context....    I've been a fan of WT ever since middle school when I accidentally came across \\"Ice Queen\\" online. At this point, Enter and Mother Earth were the band's only albums. I spent nearly all of middle and high school with songs from these albums on repeat, and added The Silent Force and later The Heart of Everything to the mix in college. During that time I fell in love with other symphonic metal bands (yes, WT was my first) and really grew into that epic, grand sound where metal meets classical. I know that WT's sound has evolved from album to album since they appeared on the music scene, starting as more of a doom metal band on Enter to a more symphonic metal sound on Mother Earth and The Silent Force to a symphonic rock style on The Heart of Everything.    When I started hearing about The Unforgiving album, I started to wonder. They were talking up a \\"new sound\\" (which can always be alarming), also well as a unique multi-medium concept combining music, film and comics. I was especially concerned when I heard about the comics part -I was worried that the music would be super-cheesy. I was wrong, instead WT delivered a rock album with strong 80s pop influences that is the most unexpected and diverse album from the band to date, ranging from harder rock/metal to catchy, pop-friendly rock tunes, melodic rock and even pop/dance tunes (yeah, you heard me).    My favorite song on the album is definitely \\"Iron.\\" Not only is it the closest to WT's previous sound, but it's a powerful, gut-wrenching explosion of symphonic metal with inspirational lyrics that's easy to get behind. I also found that \\"A Demon's Fate\\" was also a great addition -it's a heavier song with edgy, emotional lyrics and fabulous string sections. Then there's \\"Murder,\\" a darker, gritter song that has power, strength and takes the album into dark places.    Then there are the songs that had to grow on me due to their popp-ier nature, such as \\"Where is the Edge?,\\"  \\"Shot in the Dark\\" and \\"Faster.\\" I actually find it interesting that the album's first single was \\"Faster,\\" as it's one of the weaker songs on the album -it was probably chosen due to its catchy, and more radio-friendly sound, not the mention the overt 80s pop influences.    Then...there's \\"Sinead,\\" the song that shocked me -and probably many other WT fans. \\"Sinead\\" is a dance/pop song with strong string sections (probably the only thing that keeps me from deleting the song from my iTunes) worthy of Lady Gaga. I know, I just mentioned WT song and Gaga in the same sentence. Yeah, I can see this one becoming big in clubs. As you may expect, when I first heard this song, I freaked. Did something accidentally get put on the WT album? You have to be kidding me. What is this??    For some odd reason the slow songs didn't really do it for me on here -which is absolutely not normal for WT! Out of \\"Fire and Ice,\\" \\"Stairway to the Skies\\" and \\"Lost,\\" I'd have to go with \\"Lost\\" as the most moving (and haunting) with \\"Stairway to the Skies\\" in second.    Note on bonus tracks: the North American version is actually the most complete with \\"Empty Eyes,\\" \\"I Don't Wanna\\" and \\"The Last Dance\\" (not to be confused with \\"The Dance\\" or \\"The Last Time\\"). Other versions include \\"Empty Eyes\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna\\" along with the previously released \\"Utopia.\\"    Interestingly enough, I thought that The Unforgiving offered some of the best and most cutting-edge music of WT's career. In particular, the guitar work here is, without a doubt, the more complex and impressive guitar work the band has ever delivered. Really, almost every song has a guitar solo and it never ceases to amaze. Oh, and Sharon sound just as amazing as ever. But, some of the pop/lighter sounds here still make me cringe when I heard them...but that doesn't stop me from listening.    I know this isn't the WT I first loved, but they have found a new sound here that feels like a natural progression from their previous albums. While yes, there are something things that I still find myself cringing at, I enjoy the album for the most part. I really respect the band for doing something so diverse and different, even though it may have angered some of their fan base. The Unforgiving is an excellent album that's filled with power, inspiration and amazing creativity.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Stunning movie, anyone expecting anything less than a masterclass in psychological horror should steer clear. As a study of a womans decent into madness it (almost) rivals Polanskis Repulsion. But the Blu Ray... Triple Play Edition simply shows that the Blu Ray quality is NO different from the DVD... have distributors given up on HD? That aside, a major treat for true fans of grown up cinema.
0439023521|5.0|I'm going to assume you know what this book is about already and go straight into my review.<br />I really loved this book. I like how there is a bit of space between the time Katniss is chosen and she actually enters the game. The plot is enthralling. There's just the right amount of action in the games with enough detail to make you slightly disgusted but not totally turned off. Oh, and Collins's writing kicks butt!<br />But what I loved more then anything about this book was the characters! Katniss is what a real \\"strong heroine\\" should be like. Seeing someone like her was refreshing, because so many heroines these days are either incapable, two dimensional, or \\"I'm just as strong as a man and need to prove it every five minutes by being a jerk\\"-ish. Peeta... How we love thou Peeta... Quite honestly, I thinks it's nice to see a \\"nice guy\\" the love interest for once. Browse the Amazon shelves and read the descriptions. You're bound to find more bad boys then good ones the object of girls' affection.. I won't spoiler too much for you by telling you about every character, but let me say, these characters are a big part of why I love the Hunger Games!<br />While there are laughable elements (like \\"Peeta\\" being a baker), I think every fan needs to be able to snicker at their fandom. It is so unbelievably easy to look past these.<br />While I wouldn't recommend this book to EVERYONE, as it is too dark and gruesome for the more gentle among us, I would recommend it to anyone who loves strong heroines, amazing plots, action and romance, star-crossed lovers... the list goes on.

B004XQO90O|4.0|Lots of weird things happen in quantum physics. But they happen at subatomic levels. Collision results \\"happen\\" microseconds before the collision happens. Some particles appear to go backwards in time. That's the only way to explain it. Tachyons. The famous Cat of Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger's paradoxical thought experiment, you can solve the equations two different ways, like quadratic equations. Solve one way and Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat lives, solve it the other way and the cat dies. But what if there are multiple realities where the cat lives in one and dies in the other? But what if these micro subatomic physics events happened on a larger, on a human level?<br /><br />This sad and clever scifi story deals with a terrorist who tries to blow up a train and a city. When he fails he tries again. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the former fighter pilot who tried to discover him and stop him. Michelle Monaghan plays the cute, sweet, love interest in a short skirt.<br /><br />The movie deals with the wild weird world(s) of quantum mechanics with multiple realties and time streams that exist simultaneously, and advanced computers. It has things in common with such diverse movies as the classic \\"The 12 Monkeys\\" , the silly comedy \\"Goundhog Day\\" and the the \\"Einstein Bridge\\" from M John Harrison's very strange quantum physics scifi book \\"Light\\". And the quantum physics stuff in Neal Stephenson's \\"Anathem\\". As they point out in the movie, it \\"isn't about time travel, but multiple realities\\" (!) The complex plot deals with how these simutaneous multiple realities resolve themselves.<br /><br />A \\"concept\\" movie, if you like \\"Inception\\" and \\"The \\"Adjustment Bureau\\", you'll like this.<br /><br />Without giving more plot away, the movie is ultimately creepy and sad, but suspenseful and consistently holds your interest. The ending has a tacked-on quality...
0486237664|5.0|I've had this book for years and I'll add to the other praises for this book, that it is indeed awesome. I use books like these and this one in particular as drawing reference for textures and illustration styles (I use historical styles as a base for my own work and modernize it a bit). This one and Heck's Pictorial Archive of Nature and Science are almost always the first two I pull off my shelf when I start doing research for a new illustration.
B0035RZNTI|3.0|Arjen thought his audience was two different groups: Prog rock fans and metal fans.  For The Universal Migrator, he made a prog rock album (part 1) and a metal album (part 2).

I love his other Ayreon works because they combine great aspects of prog and metal together in a way that doesn't bore the ear the way a lot of prog rock does, and doesn't fatigue it the way a lot of metal does.      There are a couple good songs on this album but on the whole I rate it as the weakest of the Ayreon project.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|How's this for a backup band? JD Souther, k.d. lang, T-Bone Burnett, Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, and more. Good Lord. And they all adored Roy, and this CD is why.<br /><br />This album, evening, & event showcases the unparalleled talents of one of the all-time best rockers and songwriters and singers. He was called The Voice, and you have only to listen to Running Scared to know why. The Beatles opened for him in 1963. Opened! His performing career spanned four decades; this evening's concert was recorded not long before his untimely death in 1988. He'd just been inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and released The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 (there was no vol. 2), [[ASIN:B000008LOV The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1]], a CD by a delightful band comprising Roy, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne.<br /><br />Bob Dylan, though I can't properly attribute this, was thought to have said of Roy that he sang in \\"three or four octaves that made you want to drive your car over a cliff.\\" Something like that.<br /><br />Only rarely has anyone come close to writing or composing such deeply textured, emotional, fully human songs, and this is why we still listen in awe to his astounding works. He speaks to the deep, dark, scary places in us all that we keep secret, as well as to the rapturous heights of requited romantic love. Sidelong glances at what could have been, haunted narratives of rejections, gleeful celebrations of never expected acceptance. All the stuff we started to understand as adolescents and have never stopped learning.<br /><br />If you can afford only one Roy Orbison disc for your library, this should be it. The DVD, [[ASIN:B0006QAIFA Roy Orbison - Black & White Night (DVD & DVD Audio)]], is another great. You can see the largely younger audience wilding it up over their first experience of Roy, amazed and thrilled. It doesn't get old.<br /><br />A lot of us just start tripping over our words trying to express how awesome is this man's work. It's a superlative salad, but it means something, and it's all true.'s a superlative salad, but it means something, and it's all true.
B001NLKT60|5.0|In this story, you're going to be taken through an exciting mystery, surrounding a sex trafficking scandal.  If you're thinking that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was a perfect ending to the story and you don't understand how the characters could possibly develop further, than you clearly haven't even tried the sample, because when you're finished reading this one, you'll being dying to know what's going to happen.  Salander is in deeper than ever, and could use the help of her closest friends, including Mikael Blomkvist. It's a very intricate story that evolves Salander's character more than you may have thought possible.

0316056863|5.0|Bought this book because I was going on a road trip and needed something to listen to so that I didn't die of boredom. I'm a big fan of 30 Rock and thought...maybe this will be funny. It didn't let me down. As I guy without kids there were several part of the book that I couldn't relate too, however, Tina is just funny and she writes so even I, with no experience of being a woman or a mother, could still fine the humor.
B0004Z33EG|3.0|I love the movie, by far the best of the Rambo movies.  However, the DVD quality was not too good.  The movie was very dark, very difficult to watch and really see what was going on.
B0045DO8NI|5.0|I got this CD as a gift and I love it. This is a really good greatest hit CD, if you like Pink and pop music. I would recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't mind buying hit CDs, especially in this day of age because of the economy. And even though I like to buy full albums from a vast of artist I listen too, I can't wait to hear more in the future from P!NK.
1603420398|5.0|This book is wonderful! The contrasting color photos of each motif show details perfectly so you know what to expect with your finished product.  They also serve as great motivation and inspiration.  In the interest of economy, I tend to borrow books from the library as opposed to purchasing.  However, this book is an absolute MUST OWN!!!!  This book, some yarn and a crochet hook is a great portable craft to carry with you in waiting room situations!
1439181780|5.0|We are all searching for contentment. The contentment we desire exists on many levels: Emotional, financial, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual and occupational. The Secret: The Power by Rhonda Byrne provided me with effective, rejuvenating, and usable tools which when put into practice created a state of serenity. The book helped generate an array of attitudes, behaviors and wisdom that opened a window for personal growth.<br /><br />Everyone wants to live a fulfilling life. We all have objectives, goals, and dreams whether business or personal. In this highly stressful and tension-filled world, there can often be nothing more desirable than to get a glimpse into some timeless wisdom.<br /><br />I was able to grant myself permission to get away from the commotion, noise, and the accelerated pace of city life. I took this book with me on a holiday where I was able to feast my eyes on meandering coastlines, tree-filled forests, mountains, lakes, rivers, and picturesque towns. The book complemented the clean air, roaring fireplaces, satisfying food and tranquil surroundings.  I created the perfect sanctuary to rejuvenate and recharge my batteries. Having the book with me really enhanced my capacity for enjoyment.<br /><br />I especially liked the concept of using my emotions as a form of fuel to generate the outcomes I desire. The Power taught me how to embrace life, and expand my capacity to love. I feel much happier, freer and optimistic since reading this book. I have hope for the future.<br /><br />Reviewed by: C.J. Good, Author ~
159562015X|5.0|This is a great book, with excellent information.  The value of this book is in taking the StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment and then reading about what your top five strengths.  This is a very solid concept - to focus on people's strengths rather than their weaknesses.  Wonderful!
B001993Y3G|2.0|I had very fond memories of this movie as an early teen, and truly for the time it was made, it was a decent piece of entertainment. This movie, unfortunately, hasn't aged very well. I find, as an adult, that I have a much harder time getting past Kevin Costner's wooden acting, possibly because since this movie we've had the \\"opportunity\\" to see Kevin Costner fill more roles he is similarly ill suited for.<br /><br />However, the Prince of Thieves film is still entertaining, worth owning if you can find it at a decent price. It was a milestone in creating historical films that looked more \\"lived in\\" and reasonably authentic to what we'd seen previously, and PoT has a solid cast overall.<br /><br />I can't, however, recommend this extended version. Director's cuts and extended editions tend to not work out too well, generally speaking. They're generally cut a certain way for a reason and watching it cut differently, even if the scenes are passable, can ruin the pacing or atmosphere of a particular piece. (Ridely Scott films tend to be the exception as I have yet to see any of his director's cuts that were not a stark improvement over the original, including, by the way, his rendition of the Robin Hood story.)<br /><br />The extended scenes do very little to add to the film, and in fact, make it feel even cheesier than it did previously. The scene in particular where the Sherrif (along with his new Celtic ally) has a confrontation of sorts with the barons certainly did not need to be in any cut of the film. This is the sort of garbage that belongs in the special features under deleted scenes not cut back into the film. This would be forgiveable if it were possible to watch the original cut of the film, but you do not get this option.<br /><br />As far as I know, at this time, this is the only bluray edition of the film, but frankly, as the bluray doesn't look any better than a upscaled DVD, you're really better off getting the DVD of the original version of this film. I got this for $5, and frankly, I got robbed. I'd rather not own the movie at all then to have this garbage extended edition. Yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />My two cents.<br /><br />Edit: Some poor soul doesn't know the difference between disagreeing with a review and a review not being helpful.ly, I got robbed. I'd rather not own the movie at all then to have this garbage extended edition. Yes, it's that bad.    My two cents.

The colours are dreadfully enhanced, the screen rolls..don't buy it.  I have since however purchased a zone 2, and am now able to enjoy this delightful production. An evening in the company of the characters of Cranford is most pleasantly spent!

B003OWVHVC|2.0|I bought this CD after hearing his first two singles, and I also like the work of his label mate Mayer Hawthorne.  I was disappointed in this effort, I did like some of the songs such as Green Lights, Miss Fortune and Life's So Hard, but the rest of the songs I find are underwhelming, well it's not really the songs, but his voice, his voice is marginal at best.  I'd read some other reviews comparing him to the greats such as Sam Cooke and Donny Hathaway, to me those comparisons are absurd.  If you like marginal voices, with decent lyrics over decent songs, then this one is for you.

B0034G4P80|2.0|Branagh, Portman, Hopkins - they've all done great things. This isn't one of them, however.<br /><br />Effects are only soso. That \\"Bifrost Bridge,\\" for example, might have looked awesome before anyone ever played Myst, but looks a bit steampunk by today's standards, and the rest of Asgard rises to the same unimpressive standard. (That assassin-bot was pretty cool, though.) Acting? Well, technically, I suppose that's what you'd call it. Thor and Loki both came across as shallow, childish, and mercurial. In fact, among the Aesir at least, the only one who really interested me was Heimdall. Given such weak central characters, even very good work in the supporting roles (and there was some) couldn't save this.<br /><br />Branagh's done a fair job with Shakespeare's work. That skill just doesn't transfer to what should have been a glorious and heroic effect-fest. I don't recommend this one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
0060936223|5.0|I picked the book up at Target as I wanted something different to read after a long weekend of work.  I had no idea that this book would be so masterfully written, engaging, and insightful.  Patti Smith's writing style is pure poetry in and of itself, and she transported me vividly into a time and place I knew nothing about.<br />Her love and respect for Robert beautifully seeps into every page and she reflects upon her time with him in a passionate and revered way.<br />Even in you have no history of Patti Smith or Robert Mapplethorp, this book is well worth reading.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|I rated the Pavarotti/Battle Elixer of Love DVD 4 stars but continued to search for a better one due to Pavarotti's inability to act. While Pavarotti is a buffoon playing a buffoon, Villazon is a dashing Nemorino masterfully playing a charming buffoon. So well in fact that you think Netrebko would fall in love with him without the Elixer, which is of course the point of this wonderful comedy. Donizetti's enchanting comedy 'L'Elisir d'Amore' was performed with such brilliance, playfulness and sense of fun that I found myself hoping Elixer of Love were four hours instead of two. I would agree that there is a special chemistry between Netrebko and Villazon that is absolutely charming and at the end they engage in a smoldering embrace and kiss which leaves me believing they must be an item. Villazon delivers a tenderly sung 'Una furtiva lacrima' bringing down the house and requiring an encore. The snake oil salesman played by Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and the Sergeant Belcore played by Leo Nucci are superbly sung and acted. Staging, costumes, acting, orchestration, video quality, audio quality and subtitling are all superb. This is a perfectly charming and touching opera.
B004VQK9XW|5.0|I wish, so badly, that I didn't like this. This started off as one of those random Amazon suggestions that landed in my queue. Just so I could hate on this with impunity, I decided to give it a listen. The track that I picked was #2 Lies of the Beautiful People. Mistake... It's awesome. I then picked Skin because I was sure it was going to be a pretentious piece of crap with that title. It was great. Powerful, thoughtful, and beautiful.     This is wonderful and even as a cynical dork with all of the requisite angst and pre-built loathing, this is terrific. It's well produced (but not over produced), thought-provoking, and generally enjoyable.    Give it a try. There's nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure now and again.
B004X4QW42|5.0|This is a classic style Martial Arts film and no doubt will end up as one itself. The down side is its not a English version but if you have the time to read the subtitles its fine. I am not too bad with 3 forms of Chinese so I probably got by reading alot less subtitles than most. Its worth watching twice . Once for the words and once for the action so you dont miss anything. I would really call it a 4 star film because there was no English version but again since I can understand it I gave it a 5 . Its worth a watch . If you liked the original I would say this is close to that in quality and action. With any luck we will see this young actor in future rolls other than Ip Man as well. Its been way to long since we had martial arts films to watch and a good story behind it never hurts.

B000FC1MOQ|4.0|Even after being called out on how his story had parts that were embellished.  I still thought that it was a really gripping story about addiction and becoming a functioning being.  Keeping in mind that it was half in his mind, I still would recommend this book.
B001DF68MA|4.0|I purchased this because my bike did not accept rear seats due to the way it was made.  I have had it for a few weeks now.  it was easy to install, and we immediately went for a ride. I love it, since my daughter can sit in the front and see everything.  We would ride around and she points everything out.  Its alot of fun.  Initially, The shoulder straps fell off her alot and i and to use a string that i used with a needle to thread them closer at the back so they do not fall off the shoulders, and it worked fine.  The unit was installed secure, but wish the plastic at the back was a little more stiff.  I definately recommend this, and the shoulder strap issue, and the back support is why i gave it a 4 star. Also if you have a large kid, this will probably not be as good.

1416562605|5.0|It was probably about two years ago when I read this book. I bought it because I was looking for something to read and it had won the Man Booker prize. I was definitely not disappointed. The novel is supremely intelligent, funny, ridiculous with the ring of truth. I had never read a classic at the same time that it has come out until I read this book. It is rich in important themes like class struggle and the imbalance of international economics, but the plot never skips a beat, so one is exposed to these realities without the any lecturing or preachiness. The themes are just there in the background, and the novel has the impact of real experience. I've seen some negative views on here from the Indian community and others, and I get the feeling that some of the dark humor is lost on them, perhaps because some of it hits too close to home. If you happen to be one of those people with more \\"refined\\" tastes, that shys away from the true violence of reality, this book isn't for you. But if you can take it with a grain of salt, you will see it as pure brilliance. Adiga is a sharp and skilled novelist, and I hope that he has a bright future ahead of him.

B004X0Y8LU|5.0|There does not seem to be much a following for the Wild Beasts in the US, but they have been delivering some very enjoyable CD's for the last couple years.  Smother is another solid release.  It lacks the giddy silliness of the previous efforts, but it just feels more mature and smooth as a result.      I have recommended this band to several friends and gotten very lack luster response.  Honestly they take some listening to to.  It took about half a dozen listens for me to realize how amazing Limbo Panto was.  Two Dancers was a little bit more accessible, but that may have been because I was already sold on them.  Smother comes right out of the gate with 10 solid tracks that are easier to get your ears around.    We had a nice, long, uninterrupted listen over a bottle of Malbec and it was an aurally pleasing experience.

B002LL13BQ|4.0|I treasure this production of La Boheme even though musically it's not the best on offer.  This is Zeffirelli doing what he has done so well before - giving us wonderful sets and superlative lighting effects to create a Boheme that really takes you to the Paris of that period.  The two lead singers were presumably chosen for their youth and good looks rather than vocal ability because though Stratas and Carreras make a very credible pair of lovers their singing just isn't in the same league as the many others who have interpreted these roles - Carreras is not Pavarotti and Stratas can't hold a candle (if you'll pardon the pun!) to Freni or Fowles.  I think the chap who sings Marcello is splendid (can't remember his name) but James Morris (never a favourite of mine) is a rather insipid Colline and the other soloists are adequate but not outstanding.  Renata Scotto is a lively but rather screechy Musetta.  If the singing is not wonderful, though, it is always acceptable and the acting is excellent throughout.  Carreras is particularly suited to the role of tender and sensitive (if somewhat weak) lover (remember his Don Jose?) and he makes an irresistable Rodolfo.  Stratas looks a bit frog-faced and even for a consumptive her make-up is startlingly pale, but she has the acting ability to give us a Mimi who is youthful, vulnerable and by turns playful and pathetic. At times this is a bit overdone but she does have such big, expressive eyes!  The death scene is particularly well done.  Sound quality is not wonderful if you are particularly fussy about such things, but I find it acceptable and would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a truly enjoyable, authentic and traditional (in terms of sets and costumes being appropriate to the period) La Boheme.
0316067598|5.0|When I first picked up this book at Costco, I figured it would be nothing more then another leftwing bash of the american military missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. It was a great thing to find it was just the opposite. A true story of the nightmare that is war in a territory where those of the cutting edge are not given full authorization to protect themselves at all times due to 'political correctness'. The bok splits its narrative between BUDS in Sab Diego, CA, and the actuall Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan. The US Navy SEALS are considered possibly the best in the worl for special operations, as the training section proves as they are punished left and right to pass BUDS. These four warriors never gave up, keep true to one another, and all save one gave the ultimate for a nation that wavers on its support. Read these pages, understand Luttrells beliefs and attitude for what it was, the true Navy SEAL.
0307887960|3.0|Low fat pure protein for days and then a touch of vegetable matter is allowed.  Weight loss on any deprivation diet is expected and, if you really like lean meats, you will like this.  As a semi-vegetarian, I have to pass.  I would even prefer the cabbage soup diet.<br /><br />Some medical studies will have to be done to see if this way of eating (and it is a lifestyle change) is safe over the long run.  If you are older or have medical problems (which we older folks tend to have), it might be wise to discuss it with your doctor.

0439023513|5.0|I can only imagine Ms. Collins choosing each word in this story with extraordinary care, crafting exactly the ending that fit her vision of the entire story arc. I was afraid she would chicken out, give us an easy ending, one that so many readers wanted.    But she didn't. It is an uncompromising ending to a horrific story. It could not have been more horrific if Kitness had died, or Peeta, or Gale. Instead, they all live, broken, less than they might have been, and yet more.    Kitness was 17! There is no world in which a good outcome can be had for 17 year old children when they live through horrific events such as are in this story. These are the child soldiers of Africa, of the Palestine, of the drug wars in Latin America, where the enemy of your enemy is not your friend, or even a ally.    This story is almost too adult for adults. It is too real, too gut wrenching, too... much. It is a great story.

1608191664|5.0|This book is clear, insightful and honest. A joy to read.    The Author does not pretend to have a \\"neutral\\" position on his subject. On the contrary, he is very open on his defence of regulated, as opposed to radical free market variations of capitalism. Indeed, he argues that there is no such thing as a free market to begin with.    Mr. Chang deserves praise for introducing laypeople to some of the most pressing questions of our time, while avoiding the oversimplifications so often seen in popular texts. On the other hand, his book is obviously not meant to be a treatise on political economy. Therefore, it sacrifices depht for broadness at some points -- never turning shallow, though.

B0050PYNOY|3.0|This is similar to Krod Mandoon (which was cancelled) in that it pokes fun at all those medieval hero movies. This one also incorporates aspects of Greek mythology. There are two princes, Fabious and Thadeous. Fabious (James Franco) is patterned after Perseus. He has rescued his princess, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) from the ogre and is to be wed. During the wedding, the evil magician (Justin Theroux) shows up and abducts the bride. The king orders the portly, foul-mouthed, vulgar, inept Thadeous to join his brother on the perilous quest to rescue the would-be princess from the evil magician and bad script. Natalie Portman, who failed to read said vulgar script prior to accepting the role, joins the quest with her push-up padded bra and thong bikini. Their goal is to stop the wedding of the evil wizard and Belladonna during the eclipse of the conjunction of the 2 moons which will lead to the birth of a dragon, who will be under the control of the chosen one. Got all that?<br /><br />The humor is crude and sexual. I didn't mind it up to the point they had to masturbate the wise wizard (a muppet take-off of Yoda). At this point I realized they had squandered an opportunity by constantly substituting crude sexual humor for good satire. This is one of Natalie Portman's worst films.<br /><br />Nudity, f-bombs, mf-bomb, crude sexual humor, crude gay humor, sophomoric humor, multiple penis jokes.

The crowd is one of the bests of the world and we have INFINTE material of the band playing, so when you have something to showcase in a DVD release, well, go do it well! The crowd is amazing, and the image looks superb, you can almost recognize EVERY face from the crowd at an amazing distance... kudos to the HD cameras here...    On the DVD, I think it's amazing. Maybe it seems better to me because I was at the River Plate concerts, (I went to the December 2nd show) and watching all my people there, singing, jumping in joy is just breath taking.  But that doesn't mean the DVD is bad, actually, it's amazing, take a look at \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" , \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", \\"TNT\\", \\"Let There Be Rock\\", \\"Hells Bells\\" , \\"The Jack\\", all are amazing versions that beat by far the ones in \\"No Bull\\" and \\"Stiff Upper Lip Live\\" and are there up with \\"Live At Donington\\".    Yeah, sure, the split screen is messed up at some points, but is it not great to see the band doing something and the crowd's reaction at the same time? Didn't you like watching Ang and Mal playing the Back in Black riff at the same time? or some great shots of 3 members at the same time WITHOUT changing angles so quickly?  And about that, here's some major improvement for the ones who doesn't like quick camera changes.... the end of \\"TNT\\" says it all.    Just go get the thing , sit down and enjoy more than 2 hours of the greatest rock n roll band on the planet and don't complain about the little things,you should be thankful that a bunch of guys at their 50s and 60s are still around and kickin ass!
B002ZG99N6|3.0|A group of thugs from Charlestown, Boston, Mass. rob a bank. They take the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) along with them. They take her license and leave her by the ocean, only to find out she lives 4 blocks away. Ben Affleck, the brains of the group, stalks her to find out what she knows. He starts to date her and falls in love, or at least a Charlestown version of love, he buys her dinner, they have sex and he gets her a necklace. The relationship was not well developed due to the bad writing of Affleck who was more concerned about his scene shots than giving us a believable script. Ben and his boys rob more places. The FBI knows everyone in the gang who committed the crimes and start to close in to a final climatic scene.<br /><br />Not Affleck's best role. Never write, direct and star in the same movie. Sex, F-bombs, no nudity. This movie was referenced by the GOP to describe their relationship to the Tea Party with Affleck being the GOP and the Tea Party being his psycho killer friend...and the Tea Party liked the analogy.(Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger.)
1439153663|5.0|This is the best book that I have read all year.  Once you start reading you can't put it down.  I've recommended to many friends and people I didn't even know personally.  Although this is a work of fiction, there was history behind this story that I did not know, such as the large number of Irish that had been captured from Ireland and brought to the Carribbean area and the United States.  Also, this book was a selection read by the Book Club to which I belong and we all really enjoyed reading \\"The Kitchen House\\".
B004WCTLNY|3.0|The movie starts out great. I thought it was going to be Jason Bourne vs. The Matrix. As it turns out if was a bizarre love story involving fate. Matt Damon, due to an oversleeping \\"angel\\" or controller accidentally discovers that \\"God\\" aka \\"chairman\\" (apparently Frank Sinatra took over that spot) has a master plan for humans because we can't do anything right on our own. The chairman uses \\"angels\\" to control the outcome of major events in the world by tweaking people's thoughts and sometimes causing accidents and deaths.<br /><br />Matt meets a girl and they immediately hit it off, however they were never supposed to meet again as that would change the game plan. When they do, it sends ripples through that ultimate game plan, apparently flexibility is not one of the Chairman's virtues. The movie is about them trying to be together vs. fate keeping them apart. It is perhaps more of a love story than anything else. For people who believe in a higher power, it is as thought provoking as the book of Job and make it a 4 star movie.<br /><br />This movie has no great special effects as Matrix, no fast speed fighting, no great sound track, no nudity, no sex (just implied) and I don't recall any F-bombs.

B00006878K|5.0|\\"Born Under A Bad Sign,\\" (1967), was a seminal, great hit-making record for blues giant Albert King, and was the first record he made when signed to the legendary Memphis-based Stax.  It was a partnership made in musical heaven; the talent the record company threw at this release was extraordinary.  Booker T. Jones, of the studio's \\"Booker T. and the MGs,\\" co-wrote the many-times covered title song, as well as \\"The Hunter.\\"  King was, of course, a greatly talented guitarist, but the studio gave him Steve Cropper as backing guitar.  Add Jones, and Isaac Hayes, as pianists; Donald (\\"Duck\\") Dunn on bass; Al Jackson Jr. on drums.  And don't forget the wailing Memphis Horns: Wayne Jackson, Andrew Love, and Joe Arnold.  Finally, I can't find it anywhere in print, but I believe I read/saw somewhere that the great stride pianist Champion Joe Dupree, who provided the same service on the Glasgow-born blues shouter Maggie Bell's magnificent take of the same song, provided the piano on King's \\"As the Years Go Passing By.\\"<br /><br />The title song here, King's signature tune, lives on, and has been covered by such talent as Eric Clapton, and Cream.  \\"I Almost Lost My Mind,\\" by Ivory Joe Hunter, and \\"The Very Thought of You,\\" by Ray Noble, show King taking a quick trip through mainstream music.  \\"Kansas City\\" was a Leiber-Stoller ditty.  \\"Crosscut Saw\\" is a masterpiece of concision.  And for funky blues, try \\"Personal Manager,\\" which King himself had a hand in writing, or \\"Down Don't Bother Me,\\" another one King wrote, on which his powerful attack and purity are well displayed.  Or \\"Laundromat Blues,\\" which was King's first hit single for Stax, in which we meet a musician who can be full of sass.  And the moody \\"As the Years Go Passing By,\\" by Deadric Malone, one of my all-time favorite songs, though I must admit I love it slightly better in Maggie Bell's femme-oriented version that was recorded on Atlantic in[[ASIN:B000BW5SO0 Queen of the Night]].<br /><br />King was born in Indianola, Mississippi, on April 25, 1923, as, coincidentally, was B.B. King - no relation, nor is the third blues King, Freddie King. However, Albert did, perhaps, like to fudge things a little: he called his favorite Gibson Flying V guitar Lucy, as B.B. King calls his guitar Lucille. I actually did get to listen to Albert live, quite a few times; his power could energize a room.  In fact, I followed Albert around for two weeks observing him on his first, possibly his only, tour of the United Kingdom, in, I believe, 1969.  I almost didn't get to go.  I was, initially, to be traveling on a ticket meant for a Memphis Horn.  But when the impresario of the tour discovered the Horns weren't coming, he was furious, and cashed in those tickets.  However, I'd already pre-sold my article on Albert to \\"Cavalier,\\" a magazine current at the time.  So Stax bought me a ticket.<br /><br />At any rate, B.B. is still with us, and still making music, but Albert, who based himself in East St. Louis, passed of a heart attack, as a relatively young man, on December 21, 1992.  He could bend a guitar to his will in ways we're not likely to see again.  A must.ippi, on April 25, 1923, as, coincidentally, was B.B. King - no relation, nor is the third blues King, Freddie King.

B00511ONPG|5.0|Even though I work with the author and have heard these stories many times, I still managed to learn something. So many marketing and social media books try to give you advice in the form of vague statements like \\"have great content\\" or \\"be responsive\\" but the advice normally ends there. This book goes beyond the vague suggestions and cliche terms. Dave outlines exactly what counts as \\"great content\\" and exactly what steps are required for \\"being responsive.\\" Each chapter tackles a necessary component to being successful in social media marketing and each chapter ends with action items that can put his words into a reality for your business. If you want to learn where to begin with using social media for your business, I would recommend this book. If you already think you know everything about social media marketing, I would still recommend this book because so many of the obvious necessities are the things we forget to do everyday. Overall, education & fun to read! Very #likeable!

0756404738|3.0|Rothfuss is a great storyteller, but the flaws of the first book remain. The first-person narrative lacks depth for other characters. The story arc moves slowly. Coincidences used to move the plot along are even more glaring now that the magic of the magic is no longer novel. But though sections of the book will bore even fans, and the tale much more straightforward than most other good books, enough happen to rescue it, and they do delay the end of the book. It'll be years before the next one arrives.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Play \\"sigh no more\\" and you will be tapping your foot & singing along no matter where you are! btw, M&S are like my other fave band, U2, in that their live performances are even more exciting. Catch them at a venue near you, as soon as you can, because their popularity is skyrocketing which usually means higher ticket prices can't be far behind.
B003Y74KC0|4.0|When my wife received her iPhone4 she was ecstatic.  She was one of those people like in the commercial that was waiting forever for it to come to Verizon.  So when it finally came she was not disappointed.  But now a new dilemma presented itself - there are about a billion different products for the iPhone and some are created for the AT&T version and some for the Verizon version.  This silicone case ended up being a good find since it did not add extraneous bulk or weight to her phone, but yet provided a level of protection against minor bumps and scratches.  Most importantly, it also precluded her from the dreaded signal disappearance by the wandering pinky. The silicone itself helps to prevent it from slipping on many surfaces and has additional grooves molded in the back to help improve its grip.  And of course, having a pink one helped to give her a level of distinction and envy in the office.  I would say that the only minus part is that it has a big Amazon logo branded on the back.  Since it is molded into the skin, it is hard to see from afar, but very visible up close.  Depending upon your preferences, this can be annoying.   But if simple and cheap is what you are after, it is hard to beat.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was in near-perfect form when he made \\"Rear Window,\\" a stylish, minimalistic blend of mystery and dark comedy. This thriller explores \\"what you shouldn't see\\" skilfully, with a few funny bits thrown in. And having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />Photographer L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries (Stewart) got run over during a shoot, and is crankily waiting for his cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some (\\"Miss Torso\\") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down.<br /><br />But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.<br /><br />Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. In the case of \\"Rear Window,\\" that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.<br /><br />Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone. All the action takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.<br /><br />Jeff is likable as only James Stewart could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite that. Kelly does an equally solid job as the \\"girl who is too good for him,\\" who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.<br /><br />\\"Rear Window\\" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous.

0385333846|5.0|I have a friend who reads lots of books about WWII. That's not my favorite genre, so after I finished the acknowledged classic Slaughterhouse Five, I was excited to finally have a book we could discuss together.  Imagine my surprise when I found out she hadn't read it! Turns out she thought it was science fiction, so didn't feel compelled to read it. What a mistake. Why are we (myself included) so afraid to step outside of our boundaries and read something different? No wonder many authors, Vonnegut included, chafe so at being classified as this-or-that genre.  So limiting. Even my scifi book club, for which I read Slaughterhouse Five, was mixed over whether this book was scifi or not. But we agreed it didn't matter.  It is simply a Great Book.  And Great Books are Great no matter what their subject, genre, or era. The genre thing comes down to this: I do not want to spend my precious time reading mediocre works about WWII, and the same goes for my friend vis-a-vis scifi.  But brilliant works like Slaughterhouse Five or The Left Hand of Darkness (which won the 1970 Hugo Award over Slaughterhouse Five) really should be read by everyone. Yes, that means YOU!
0307887960|5.0|I am on day 11 and I have lost 9lbs. A friend and I are doing this together and she has lost 13. Because I am extremely hypothyroid, it is very hard to lose weight especially when my numbers are off, as they are now. However, I am losing and it has been pretty painless. I haven't cheated at all and I haven't been hungry. The freedom to eat yogurt, especially greek yogurt has been great. My energy level was low the first 5 days of the Attack phase, but I'm feeling normal again. Not every diet is for every person -- you might want to give this one a try.            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Her talents speak from the pictures published in this edition of her works. The lessons, poetry, rhythm are silently shared as the captured moments tell their individual stories.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This review has nothing to do with the movie, you knkow it's great.  I bought the 3 pack because I can watch the Blu-Ray disc at home with the kids, the regular disc goes in the car for long drives and the digital download goes on my iPad for my business trips.  3 different ways to enjoy the best movie of 2010. BTW it was a good price and the shipping was reasonable too.
B000001GAM|5.0|I do not know much about Bruckner and which performances are considered to be at the pinnacle. But let's just say that among Berstein, Karajan and Guilini's versions, the latter is the one that sends most chills through my spine.   If you have a decent sound system (i.e., CD player, hopefully a DAC, an amplifier spike mounted speakers, and good cables), this is a real sonic treat.

B003M98792|4.0|The definitive version of Lone Wolf & Cub as far as I'm concerned.  The American editors had the hindsight the original filmmakers could never have and they've nudged two good films into the realm of greatness.  The addition of the child's voiceover (voiced by a real child so it has the same vibe as the old Peanuts cartoon voices) really makes the film work.  Whether you have a copy of this seminal samurai film or not, the step up to Blu is impressive.  While it's not as crisp as a modern transfer of a modern film, it's the best SA has ever looked.  Ignore the extras, as they're mostly filler since none of the Japanese cast or crew is involved, but it's worth owning for the fine transfer.
B003UESJH4|4.0|The King's Speech, which of course won the Academy Award for Best Picture, was not, in my opinion, the best film of 2010, but it was pretty close. (I thought the biggest highlights of that year were The Social Network and Toy Story 3, but that doesn't affect my opinion of this stellar film one bit.) Memorable performances anchor this story of overcoming adversity and the friendship that develops between King George VI and his speech therapist. The approaching second World War is the secondary focus of the film, which at times struck me as a little odd (surely the conflicts in Europe should carry more weight than a man's stammering problem), but this is not a World War II picture so much as a personal one, set against that historical background.<br /><br />The special features give some added background on the real people portrayed in this film and provide good balance for this single disc presentation of the film. Overall, this is a good release and a great choice to add to your dvd collection.

1862055149|5.0|I have to say that I really love this book.  Chef Thompson has provided an excellent resource, with extensive research on his part of the Thai culture and most importantly the true Thai food experience I've been searching for these past many years.  As another reviewer noted, this book is not for the faint hearted, however I hope this doesn't discourage those who truly enjoy and love the culinary Thai cuisine as much as I do.  There may be some labor, but it is worth it for me as I've been searching for as close to authentic as I can get.          As any good chef/cook should first do is get to know their location,  understand what you may be limited to in terms of produce, and if anything check out the menu at your local Thai restaurant and get to know what menu items are available.  If you have questions about something you can always ask.  That being said, there are some items called out for in this book that is not available to me, but this hasn't stopped me from trying the other MANY recipes in this book that I can make.  Once again, I enjoy this book, I enjoy cooking, I've worked the line and I know what is labor intensive and what techniques to use.  There are other Thai cookbooks that can give you less intensive recipes, for example Vatch's Thai Street Food which is another excellent resource.  This book, however, has exceeded my expectations and continues to be valuable as my love for the cuisine provides a drive to learn Thai cooking.
0345509617|5.0|I hate most of video and computer games. My son has been nagging me to buy a video game for 2 years, and I didn't do it.     Last time, when he was at the peak of his emotional vent when he knew anyone else in his class has a DS and most of kids have video games. After failing to persuade him not to buy a video game for 2 weeks,I agreed  to buy a Star War computer game (an old cheap one) for him since he is a star war fan. For some unknown reasons (we are not good at computer stuff), it didn't work on my computer, so he could not play it. At the same time, I found this book, I tried to persuade him that this book is better than other video or computer games. After he read the feedback, he  agreed to buy this book and not play any games at home (he does play wi sometimes when he is at his friend's house).He hasn't asked me for any video games since then. I am so happy my strategy worked out and thanks for this wonderful book. He is a 4 student in his class, and his teachers said he respects them very much. He is getting along with most of kids in the class.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Love the series but was very disappointed with the final episode of the final season.  It left me feeling \\"let-down'.  I think the writers had written themselves into a hole they couldn't fully write themselves out of.  So they settled for this simple but lame explanation.  It loosely explains the overall reason for the characters existence on the island but it falls short of explaining the multitudes of mysteries that were constantly introduced in every episode of every season.  Yes, many of the mysteries were answered earlier but I guess I was expecting some kind of grand finale revelation in the final episode and instead it was just what it was.<br /><br />But, I want a complete series so of course I bought the final season.

B001V9LPWQ|4.0|This is a classic and should be in any collection. The nice thing about this Three disc version is that if you don't have blu-ray yet is that you have the dvd version until you get blu-ray and have the best of both worlds.
B000002KGT|5.0|I am very aware that a lot of people will disagree with the title for my review,but I will try to explain my point. After so many years of listening to it (I was first introduced to it by my father when I was 7 years old, now I'm 40) I couldn´t understand why the album sounded better after each time I played it. I just couldn't understand the basis of its greatness. It was after listening to the Rumours songs on Glee that I realized what makes this album so special: timelesness.  The songs on this collection don't seem to have been recorded in 1976. You can listen to them and truly think that they are contemporary hits.  And all the songs convey an ample amalgam of feelings: love, passion, betrayal,hope for the future...  You can mention \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Exile on Main St\\", \\"The Memphis Sessions\\", \\"Thriller\\", but for me RUMOURS is the best album of all time.  And I am quite sure that there will never be another album that can do what this album has done.
B004XUDJII|5.0|We've heard several of the songs already on this album and am so pleased with the others! Mine, The Lonely- wow- great songs. She has a great voice and I just love how real the songs are...no glossing over love with Christina. Just beautiful.

1878424319|1.0|This book starts out sounding like a typical self-help book, however uninspired, but then what really jumps out at me are the little gems like the following quote that are almost nonchalantly slipped into the rest of the mundane drivel:<br /><br />\\"The mind has an ability to talk to itself. But it also has the ability to hear information that is available from other realms. Sometimes you hear a voice in your mind and you may wonder where it came from. This voice may have come from another reality in which there are living beings very similar to the human mind. The Toltecs called these beings allies. In Europe, Africa and India they called them the Gods.\\"<br /><br />Wha-wha-WHAAAAT?!  Yes, apparently the little voice in your head is actually the voice of an alternate-reality-mind-alien.  He also states quite plainly that you shouldn't say bad things about people because words have immense power and that you will hurt the people you're talking about...LITERALLY...like a voodoo curse!  He says that if you say someone has cancer then it could GIVE the person cancer!  I guess if you like play reality fast-and-loose then this book will find a nice spot in your library right between \\"Dianetics\\" and \\"The Healing Power of Crystals\\".  Say \\"hi\\" to Bigfoot for me.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I'm a big fan of LOST and I watched every episode when it aired live throughout its 6 seasons.  I do think that the 1st and 2nd seasons were the very best.

B004HKE96K|1.0|The limited edition vinyl was horribly warped. like another reivewer here my copy wouldnt play at all, either disc. 5 stars on the album, 0 stars on this pressing. Do yourself a favor and get the original version on vinyl. This is a great album, but a horrible horrible pressing. Shame pn you lost highway.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|I've loved this album since I first listened to it in college back in the 90's. It is a great introduction to the sound of reggae and the stylings of Bob Marley. I really love the collector's set that was a 4 CD set. It had some great early recordings of his, including original versions of some of his bigger hits. \\"I'm Still Waiting\\" is one of my favorites from that set. Once you've enjoyed this album, be sure to explore his other work.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This Mobile is great! My son absolutely loves watching it rotate and the leaves going up and down! I definitely recommend!
B00122BEXW|5.0|It's hilarious that no one has rated or commented on this album!  Despite the fact that this one \\"only\\" sold 8M copies and that the RHCP's themselves have said some lukewarm things about it, it still holds up b/c it retains the trademark funk influence along with a slightly harder, edgier guitar feel to it thanks to Dave Navarro!  \\"Aeroplane\\" and \\"My Friends\\" were great, radio-friendly tunes, \\"Pea\\" is the first and only song recorded with Flea singing alone & accompanying himself on bass, \\"Coffee shop\\" features a blazing bass solo, \\"One Big Mob\\" features a rap-chant approach that harkens back to the earlier days with Hillel, \\"Shallow Be They Game\\" sounds like an extension of the tracks from the previous album, \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic\\" and \\"Tearjerker\\" hints at the mellower side of the RHCP's -first evident in \\"Under the Bridge\\" and thoroughly emphasized in \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" with Dave N's shimmering guitar work-- The group clearly took a fresh approach in this effort--bass/guitar/vocal go in directions that they had not explored up to this point in their history.  So Hillel and John F. weren't in the group.  It's still a cool piece of the RHCP's history and Dave Navarro did a great job on this album.
0440178002|5.0|This is simply one of those books that takes you far away for a long period of time until your current life and the world created by the author of this book blend into each other leaving you changed in ways you can't, at this moment, begin to imagine.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|I've been reading the books since i was a kid and they first came out. I have to say I appreciate how closely the movies stick to the books, although every once in a while i shout \\"How could they leave that out!\\" These last two movies based on the final book I understand will be very difficult to put into movie form, but so far they seem to be doing fairly well although my inner harry potter geek cringes at some of the changes that they had to make in this movie, but it is a really good movie.
B004I1AGTM|5.0|This is one of the best fighting movies there is. RATE: 10++++     HUGE fan of IP Man !
B004XONU8I|5.0|I love this show, it is really fun to watch.  Alot like X-Files (without the Scooby-do endings) with a lovable Mad scientist, and kids that were science experiments... I'm hoping there is another season, not sure due to the ending of season three.
B004GBIE3Y|2.0|Beware the five-star reviews. This is a slow, cliche-filled, horribly-acted, unfunny, cloying disaster of a movie. I'm a big Zach G. fan, but he doesn't begin to salvage this crappy flick.

B004H4XI5O|4.0|I loved the stories, the research on all things memory.  Well written and researched, I learned a ton about how our memory works while being entertained following the Author's story from outsider to the US championships.  Just beware that this is NOT a book on techniques to improve your memory.
B004EWFUQY|3.0|I have been waiting for this book for six months. Finally its here and I have tried it. There is one big problem, one I should of recognized early in the reading of this book: this book is not for people who have GERD. Most people will do well on this diet, it makes sense and I'm sure it works. But for us who suffer from GERD, this diet is hell. I tried the first two days, with all the yogurt and cottage cheese, my GERD kicked in high gear and I was totally miserable for the entire week having to add several medications to offset the added dairy products. I talked to my GI doc and he said that I would be asking for more discomfort if I tried this diet any longer. So I dropped it. Oh well, back to the drawing board.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Series itself as you all know is great.<br /><br />I only want to mention on English subtitles in the season 6 and 7.<br />When you set Closed Captioning (CC) on your TV (not DVD player), you can see Closed Captioned sentences.<br />Since there is no English subtitles information on discs, DVD player cannot show any English subtitles.<br />However, as I said, CC works very well! - so do not worry about the subtitles.
B0013N3DSE|4.0|Was stunned how good this movie is. The restoration makes it look incredible and the story is a Clean adventure. To tame by todays standards but a FAR superior movie than all other Robin Hoods. This should be the way other same genre movies should be compared.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a Xoom and this app works perfectly on it.  It syncs seemlessly with my Kindle and allows me to be never without a book.  I would recommend this app (which is free) to anyone who enjoys reading.
B004HZYHGM|5.0|This version contains a functioning table of contents, its proof read, the pictures are beautiful, and there is a reader friendly 'notes' section in the back which gives the reader some context and backstory to the tail.  There is also a 'Waiting for Godo' like one act play in the back between Captain Smollet and Silver, which I skimmed through for laughs.  If you are going to read this on the kindle, forgo today's cup of Starbucks and buy this version.    The book itself was a lot of fun. I am 30 and had never really heard of this book, but I got caught up in the suspense and excitement of it pretty quickly.  Its  a quick and fun adventure story featuring pirates, and I look forward to reading it to my son when he is about 5+ years old.

B003R0MEZ4|5.0|In its sixth season, \\"Criminal Minds\\" continues to be an outstanding police procedural about the agents of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.  The show offers intense weekly drama as the agents track various serial killers and kidnappers.<br /><br />A strength of the show is its superb ensemble cast, featuring Thomas Gibson as team leader Aaron Hotchner, Joe Montegna as veteran Special Agent David Rossi, Paget Brewster as Special Agent Emily Prentiss, Matthew Gray Gubler as Dr. Spencer Reid, Shemar Moore as Special Agent Derek Morgan, A.J. Cook as Special Agent JJ Jareau, and Kirsten Vangness as computer whiz Penelope Garcia.<br /><br />This season brought cast changes.  JJ Jareau was involutarily reassigned from the BAU at the beginning of the season, then helped out in a mid-season case involving Emily Prentiss.  Her brief appearence in the season finale suggests she will return.  Rachel Nichols joined the cast as young Ashley Seaver, a new agent plucked from the FBI Academy for her specialized personal knowledge of serial killers.  At season's end, a burned-out Penelope Garcia was contemplating a less traumatic career choice.<br /><br />The highlight of the season may have been the series of episodes involving a man from Emily Prentiss's past.  The charming, vicious arms dealer Ian Doyle, formerly the target of a Interpol undercover operation, stalked Prentiss over three episodes, in the process endangering the rest of the team.  In a shocking climax, Doyle kidnapped and tortured Emily while the team raced to the rescue.  In a stunning conclusion, a fight to the death caused the loss of a team member.  The BAU dealt with that loss in the remaining episodes.<br /><br />\\"Criminal Minds: The Sixth Season\\" is very highly recommended to its fans.  As of mid-May 2011, \\"Criminal Minds\\" had been renewed for a seventh season.
0547258305|5.0|Loved it! I'm not into going into detail of the plot and everything, but I think it is a great teen fantasy book, age group would probably be about 13-18. There is one mildly sensual scene, but it is non-descriptive. I don't think there are really any other red flags, so I deem it age-appropriate! It really is a great read, and I would recommend to any fantasy lovers.
B003NHRIUW|5.0|Bought this movie as a gift and was completely surprised that the movie was actually watchable. Much of the acting by Miley was terrible, however the story was actually pretty good. The movie should have been done from the perspective of the love that a parent as for their children even when the kids might act unlovable, but that's my opinion. My daughter really liked the movie for the young man who plays the love interest for Miley.
B001E45XT4|5.0|About three months ago, I got my first time ever gaming laptop! I was tempted to pay over $100 on a gaming headset worthy of my new laptop (over $3,000 worth) but after having looking and looking, I decided to give these a try. To make this quick... they are INSANELY comfortable, have a way better than average sound quality and great microphone quality! The sound could be better, but this is the best there is at this price range and perhaps all the way up to the $100-$150 price tags. The concealed microphone and style is quite neat, even if they DO look gigantic it's worth looking slightly funny while wearing these giants. It's been three months, almost four of intense gaming and music usage and they are still rocking like if it was the first day. Dropped them a couple of times.... hard. Durability seems to be incredible.     They are worth 5 stars in my opinion.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I didn't know much about Tina Fey before reading the book, but now I'm a big fan.  I may be a little late to the party but I'm glad I got the invite!  The book was very funny from beginning to end.  Must Read!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Folder organizer is an excellent application.  The developer updates frequently and changes appear to be well thought out.  I have used this tool to categorize all of my apps.  I've switched between various launcher tools, and it works in conjunction with all I've tried.  The app can utilize icons from other apps, and most icon packs that are labeled for use only with a specific launcher.  Customizable widgets, hierarchical folders; it has all the features I need.  Take it for a test drive!
032147404X|5.0|The Digital Photography Book by Scott Kelby.<br /><br />Great book so far. Scott Kelby makes you feel right at home with his wit and humor. As he fills you<br />with informative and useful information on how to get the most from your love of digital photography.<br />Digital Camera Shooting techniques on when best to shoot; how to shoot; were best to shoot from and<br />what lens best to shoot with. I can go on and on about what's in the book but I'm sure you get my drift.<br />The book is great and Kelby's break down of the book is right down to earth, plain and simple. I definitely<br />recommend it anyone interested in digital photography.
B003KLGKAA|5.0|Season Four is another great continuation from season three but it gets even bolder. The doctor gets more daring when he tries to save the world but he gets too daring for his own good. That's where his new assistant, Donna Noble, comes in.    In the second episode you meet Donna Noble for the second time (she was first introduced in season 3). Unlike Dr Who's two previous assistant, Donna is an older woman. She has low self-esteem but she never shows it. She hides her low self-esteem by being boisterous and obnoxious at times. But there are humorous, witty, and caring parts of herself that really shows through. Her humorous side makes you grin and laugh. She always says she nothing but an ordinary person who works at unfulfilling jobs at a temp agency but Dr Who shows her that she isn't ordinary but extraordinary. Donna is Dr Who's better self. When he gets too daring, and gets himself into trouble, Donna puts him back into perspective and saves his life.     Donna is not a grounded person but more of a dreamer. When she first met the Doctor, she thought his world was filled with fantastic voyages that didn't involve any danger or pain. When she got a real taste of the Doctor's life, she almost regrets being with him but decides to stay because even though she got more than she bargained for, the pains and dangers seems to change her perspective about her life for the better.     David Tennant who plays the Doctor and Catherine Tate who plays Donna Noble are the best combination of actors for the Dr Who show so far. Catherine Tate is a professional comedian that brings a lot of her best talents in humor to this series. David Tennant's portrayal as the Doctor being a little eccentric compliments Tate's humor. They make a wonderful team.      I love season four but I thought it was too rushed. When I watched all of the episodes, it seems that the producers, directors, and screenwriters were on a deadline to finish season four to make way for season five.  In the lastfour episodes, the stories didn't elaborate enough for you to understand everything, it was simply rushed. I think the reason why they rushed it was because they revamped Dr Who for season five with a new lead character and a new assistant. In season five, the screenwriters took the story telling to a whole new level with different style of storytelling from past seasons. In order to take Dr Who show to a new level, they had to finish things up with the characters from season one through four.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I have a flashlight that is between the size of a Mini-Mag and a \\"D\\" cell type.  My flashlight stays put when I holster it.  It is securely held.  Not only that but in certain situations I can rotate the holster to put the beam where I want it and still not tie up my hands.  I bought two, one for me and one for my son.  I really like it.  It takes a little effort to put my flashlight in it, but that only means it's snug.  I'm not sure if I'd like this holster if I had a larger flashlight, so I'll reserve my judgment on anything larger.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|This is one of the best cds ever it contains videos and music. The price was good and if you are looking for it in a store good luck finding it.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|The graphics in the game are amazing. The general game play is great with very realistic ball movement. I haven't tried any other ball games like this but they probably wouldn't be as good as this one is.
1416550550|3.0|Having read and enjoyed Morten's The Distant Hours, I thought I'd give this novel a try. While the former had an interesting conclusion, where you might ask yourself \\"what would I have done in that situation?,\\" this novel did not inspire me to think or wonder.  It was merely an interesting, formulaic romance.  Morton is a good storyteller and she keeps you turning the pages, but it's a story that won't stick with me in the days and weeks to come.

B003YLK2RI|3.0|The audio is only 192 kbps, like a m&eacute;dium quality mp3. Usually a high quality audio on dvd's is more or less 1400 kbps. i just do not understand why they give us fans this cheap audio.  The show is  incredibly strong and amazing, they are top musicians.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I think the movie is excellent and that all the Academy awards it won were deserved.  It is an excellent historical movie and deals with a subject of which most people are unaware.  The company that sent it was very quick and the video arrived in fine shape.
0439023521|2.0|I really wanted to like this more than I did, sadly. I think the setting and the characters are well put together. I think the writing is top notch, and I don't say that lightly. I just couldn't find my way \\"into\\" the story.     I recognize the author's ability, and the genius behind the story. I honestly do. It was just not presented in a way that I felt comfortable slipping into and really enjoying.     I know that most everyone who has read it absolutely loves it. I don't dislike it. I just don't think the presentation is quite my cup of tea. <shrug>     I hold hope for the film adaptation of this book, as I believe I'll be able to fall more into the world and enjoy it far more than I did this book. Sorry.
0307887960|1.0|My friends and I were so excited about this diet! I ordered the book, read throught it and was ready! While chatting with another friend about this new find, she suggested that I talk it over with my doctor who said \\"For a short run, this diet will offer the desired results; however, in the long run, continued use may affect your kidneys due to the amount of protein ingested\\". Hmph! So, I decided that this particular method of losing weight was not worth my worrying about kidney issues. ....Oh well.    I can't really rate the book, but I CAN say that it was an interesting read.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|Each season of 'Desperate Housewives' has had its own special theme; from the 'sizzling secrets' season, to the 'dirty laundry' season. Each of these themes link in with whats currently taking place (or what is to take place) in the lives of our Favorite television desperado's. But this season I didn't really get the theme...It looks as if the people who create the concepts for each season's look, this year, went 'we haven't done a western theme before' and decided that this would be the look for season 7, without taking into consideration what actually happens this season, which is more scandal, secrets and LIES (The only show on television that doe's this perfectly and in style).    And leading us into another paragraph is a review of the most secretive and revelation-filled seasons yet. Anything you've been wondering about from earlier seasons (one/two) such as 'what happened to that person?' or 'Where is that character now', is answered in season 7. We see the return of Felicia Tillman, Paul young and (only for one or two episodes) Paul's son, Zach Young. At this point in this rather short review of a rather long season, I realize that the theme of this season doe's relate to the things that occur in this series because it is rather 'wild' that I think of it!
B003UM8T3U|4.0|Who says you can't make a great picture cheaply and on a very tight budget?  This is only the 7th Criterion Blu-Ray release that I've seen after [[ASIN:B001WLMOG4 The Seventh Seal: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B003ZYU3TQ The Night of the Hunter: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B00393SFU2 M: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B003ZYU3T6 Modern Times: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B00393SFWU Stagecoach: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B003KGBISY Seven Samurai: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]] and \\"Breathless\\" is as unique and extremely enjoyable to watch as the rest.  This version of \\"Breathless\\" firstly comes with an excellent 80-page booklet containing essays by Godard among others. The picture quality is pretty good having been well restored and while not pristine perfect is still good to watch and one cannot overstate just how much better black and white films look on 1080p. The sound quality is less good as I would have liked to have had a DTS HD MA lossless 5.1 surround option but perhaps this mono is the best they could do. The special features are also great with the interviews of Godard and Belmondo being the standouts.<br /><br />It is obvious that this film influenced countless others as in its almost documentary-like feel with handheld cameras following the actors and shot in the streets of Paris it reminded me of William Friedkin's work in [[ASIN:B000BZIST4 The French Connection (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] and even Scorcese's work in [[ASIN:B004IFYMYI Taxi Driver [Blu-ray]]] while the overall story of amoral figures running around allowing circumstances to dictate their actions reminded me a lot of films like [[ASIN:B0010YVCHK Bonnie and Clyde (Blu-ray Book)]].  Also the way this film was made on the ridiculously cheap probably inspired films like [[ASIN:B0024FAG6M Easy Rider [Blu-ray]]] and The Blair Witch Project [Blu-ray].<br /><br />What really impressed me was the \\"surprise\\" ending with the enigmatic actions of Seberg's character at the end which made me laugh when I realised that she fooled us all along and that the naive American girl was actually the most cunning and totally self-serving (others may consider it just being realistic) character of all.  It was obvious from the start that Seberg never really loved the Belmondo character and in fact she was trying to get rid of him but like a rash that wouldn't go away she simply tolerated him knowing that it wasn't wise to upset a murderous gangster and when she saw a chance to get away from him and from his manipulating her into agreeing to go on a trip to Rome with him when she clearly preferred to continue studying at the Sorbonne at least for me all her actions made a lot of sense in the end.  Beware the naive and innocent looking as they may just turn out to be the very opposite.  In fact, the Belmondo character was on the outside what the Seberg character was on the inside and vice versa: remarkable!  I enjoyed this film so much that it too will now make it onto my shortlist of annual classic film viewing.<br /><br />Very unique film that impressed me no end and a must-have in any self-respecting movie fan's video library.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!the enigmatic actions of Seberg's character at the end which made me laugh when I realised that she fooled us all along and that the naive American girl was actually the most cunning and totally self-serving (others may consider it just being realistic) character of all.

B004N44SOI|2.0|Heroin diaries was amazing, and I'm a big Nikki Sixx fan, but what is this? Track 2/LIES OF THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE-when I first heard this on the radio I thought it was the band HOOBASTANK. Track 3/ARE YOU WITH ME-sounds like something Daughtry or Adam Lambert would do or has already done. Track 5/SURE FEELS RIGHT-is this a modern day country song? Track 7/SMILE-one of the lyrics mentions \\"are you still asleep\\"? Actually this song will put you to sleep. Track 11/SKIN-you can only take so much of the whining voice on this one. Makes me wanna slit my wrists. The book/accompaning cd \\"formula\\" worked for The Heroin Diaries, but this doesn't seem genuine.

B003IWZ1D8|4.0|Although not my favourite Hitchcock movie (that would be [[ASIN:B0017HMF6W North by Northwest (50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Book)]]) fans of this his great thriller will be very happy indeed with this blu-ray transfer which has now become the definitive and best version of the movie that is currently out there.  In addition to very good special feature documentaries we get a very good 1080p picture quality transfer and an even better DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround sound quality as well albeit there is really little surround sound to appreciate from this mostly front-heavy sonic source material but still both picture and sound quality far exceed the dvd version that I previously owned.<br /><br />The problem with whodunnit's and thrillers like this though is that the original scare value and hence appreciation of the film drops off substantially once you know the ending and unless you are a film student having to write a paper on the film or a budding director trying to learn Hitchcockian technique most casual viewers may struggle to find great rewards from repeated viewing well at least that's the case for me.  There is no doubting that this is a great classic and is essential viewing if you haven't already seen it and if that's the case this blu-ray release is currently the best way to do this.  Although I've watched this a few times I can still see myself revisiting this film from time to time although not as regularly and with great anticipation as I do for other films that I do so annually such as [[ASIN:B00003CXB2 Lawrence of Arabia]], [[ASIN:B000NTPDSW The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B001DJLCPE Dr. Strangelove  [Blu-ray]]] and especially [[ASIN:B000Q66J1M 2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray]]] among several others that I seem to be amply rewarded with each subsequent viewing.<br /><br />Great content, great picture and sound quality as well as special features makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!.    Highly recommended!
B004H1YH66|5.0|A better recording of the Conan the Barbarian score has always been on my personal \\"Man, I wish someone would make a...\\" list and, like almost everything else on that list, I held out very little real hope that someone would ever create one.  Why would they?  After all, the movie is rapidly approaching thirty years in age.  I used to play my old Varese Saraband cassette tape to shreds in my car when I was a teenager and later bought the CD.  But as my tolerance for listening to anything that wasn't a good recording shrank, my desire to listen to an old mono recording of a film score, no matter how much I liked the score itself, waned substantially over the years.    Now this finally comes out and I can cross that item off the list.
B000FC2L1E|2.0|I am a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon and the Outlander series, however, this installment came up grievously short.  While the Jamie and Claire reunion was great, the rest of the book had too much going on and was too hard to follow, she just went a bit too far.  Be that as it may, I'm still looking forward to the next book.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting the new release from the Foo Fighters and when I heard it was recorded in Grohl's garage and it would have a rawer sound than we are used to, I was even more excited.<br /><br />This doesn't disappoint in the slightest and from the opening riff of `Bridge is Burning' and those thumping drums, you know you are in for a treat.  Grohl's vocals are raw and this song is infectious.  I adore `White Limo' (which has an awesome video with Lemmy, check it out on YouTube) and this gets me tapping my feet and bobbing my head within seconds of it starting.  I especially love the ferocity of Grohl's vocals.  `Arlandria' is slightly gentler and reminds me of Them Crooked Vultures, but this still manages to chuck a chorus at you to get you bouncing along with pure joy.  The last two tracks `I Should've Known' and `Walk' ease us out in style and `I Should've Known' has a great intro which then builds throughout the song until it finishes with typical Foo Fighter grit and flair.  `Walk' is also a song that builds and by the time you get to the end where Grohl screams `I never wanna die' you are singing along with full gusto and feeling every emotion conveyed.<br /><br />This album was well worth the wait and whilst it may be classed as a lo-fi production, it in no way sounds it and the harder direction the band went in suit's them to a tee.  The Foo Fighters always knew how to write songs with infectious hooks, ripping riffs and scream along lyrics and this album is no exception.  If you are an existing fan you won't be disappointing and if you a new to the band this is as good a place as any to start.  Just be warned, you'll soon be going back and buying the rest of their albums.  Simply great stuff.<br /><br />Feel free to check out the article on my blog about their set at the BBC Big weekend, the web address can be found on my profile page.
1439152780|5.0|I usually like books that \\"get on with it\\"-- no long descriptions, no fooling around with lots of twists and turns, just a straight-forward story. This is not a straight-forward story and it takes awhile to get to the solution, but I have to admit that by page 300 I had an idea of where it was going. I just had the wrong character.<br /><br />But there are so many surprises along the way, so many of those twists and turns that I frankly could not put this book down. And it's not a book that you can put down for a couple of days and go back to and pick up the story without a bit of going back to review. It skips back and forth between 1939, 1941, and 1992, and makes you want to keep reading. It is not complicated, but the language and sentence structure is beautiful.<br /><br /> Three sisters living in a castle, dark hallways, a tower, a face at the window, yet this is not a horror story, rather it is a love story. An unusual love story, with a couple of murders thrown in, but reading it there is sympathy enough for all the characters and there are no intentional villans, just people wanting peace and happiness. A superb book.

B000JRYOPG|1.0|this movie is BEYOND POINTLESS! I don't want you to go through what I did, which is sitting through this violent and disgraceful story thinking that in the end there is going to be some sort of statement made. If you don't know that dealing drugs and threatening people with guns and shooting people will eventually get you and your associates in prison or killed, than maybe you are just ignorant enough to enjoy this movie. I liked the film Belly because it at least had a positive message about transformation and choosing a better path at the end. This is a pure disgrace. It sensationalizes, glorifies, and glamorizes extortion, violence, and the objectification of women. It is disappointing that a child of Bob Marley, who has his father tattooed on his arm, would be part of a film as negative as this. The fact that this film got so many positive reviews on here does not reflect well on humanity.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I loved this movie! Of course anything with Jason in it is going to rock! Can't wait to get my own copy!
B004XQO90O|5.0|Source Code is a suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent, occasionally touching, movie that's far better than I'd expected it to be. With tight pacing, great editing, good acting and fine directing by Duncan Jones, best known for Moon, it's a very good sci-fi action film released outside the usual summertime area for such movies.    The film tells the tale of a man (Jake Gyllenhall), who wakes up on a train. He has no idea why he's there or who the woman across from him is. As he's trying to get things sorted out, an explosion goes off, killing everyone. He then comes to inside a capsule where it's explained to him that the train was blown up in a terrorist bombing. The terrorist was kind enough to do a practice run and apparently plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Chicago. Due to some sort of \\"quantum\\" effect he can \\"leap\\" into the body of a man who died on the train and live out his last eight minutes of life. Doing that will, with luck, enable him to find the bomber.    If it's a premise that sounds familiar, that's because it is. It's perhaps no surprise that Scott Bakula's voice turns up in a cameo during the movie, since it clearly owes a lot to his most famous work. In fact, it's basically Quantum Leap mashed-up with Groundhog Day while managing to be better than the first and at least as engaging as the second.    There was really nothing I disliked about this film. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and, sadly, will likely be the best science fiction film for quite some time.
0307454541|5.0|I started reading this one afternoon and found myself canceling plans and staying up till 5:30am to finish it. it is a complete and total thrill ride, and if you like murder mysteries YOU MUST READ THIS!<br /><br />The beginning is filled with many introductions and several people told me that they almost quit the book because of it.  Skip over the all the business financial stuff in the beginning if you must, because you will know enough to proceed (or may just come back to it when your interest starts to wonder) because once the book gets to the description of the events that surround the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, I assure you that you WON'T put the book down!  It is so superbly written, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />I can hardly wait to start the next two books and view the movies!
0723259674|3.0|These are indeed the unabridged Beatrix Potter tales -- all 23 of them -- but the pages are consolidated so that illustrations are on the same pages as text where they ought to be on separate pages.  Not a big deal in itself, but something about the way the illustrations are arranged with respect to the text is unattractive.  And the covers aren't the classic, old-fashioned design.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say it's worth what we paid for it ($18ish), but I think the other, authorized editions are probably worth the extra money.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This film is interesting because of the way it is done. The story is less captivating than other ones. But it is beautiful and I am happy to have seen it.
B0014GJ08W|4.0|I heard one of Soha's songs and was immediately struck by her unforgettable voice. D'Ici et D'ailleurs is a wonderful mix of Afro-cuban songs laced with the influence of her experience in France.  While the music is enjoyable, it's not the kind of collection that I found myself able to play over and over like other favorites.  I play it, enjoy it and put it down for awhile.  Then put it on again a couple weeks later to discover something new.  Worth a listen and I'll look for more by this talented artist, too.

B003UESJHE|5.0|The King's Speech is like going a step back in time watch the man who became king going through a tough personal problem and overcoming it.It is similar to a documentary since the acting was perfect but its more intimate.  Colin Firth  \\"Bertie\\" who overcame his stammer and was eventually king, Geoffrey Rush his amazing doctor, Helena Bonham Carter the loving wife and queen. If you have not seen its,you should. If you have not purchased it you should. Its a perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon or summer night.  For my children and grand children this will become a \\"classic\\".
0394721780|5.0|I had this book a long time ago and in moving I lost it, so it is good to replace it now. I grew up watching Julia Child on TV.  She was funny.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|Wanted to like this movie, I really did.  The only good thing I can say about it is I didn't pay to see it.  Gotta love gift cards.  Red Riding Hood with werewolves, easy way out in my opinion.  Probably would have gotten over that if the acting wasn't so damn bad, Gary Oldman is the exception but that man is good in just about everything.  This fact is even more annoying since there are a lot of good actors in the movie.  The people who are supposed to love each have no chemistry and the movie didn't even creep me out.  I'm all for reinventing fairy tales but this one is ridiculous.  The only other good thing about this, other than Gary Oldman were the sets.  Everybody's tastes are different so I won't tell you not to buy it but I will tell you if you haven't seen the movie rent it first and form your own opinion.  In mine it's a waste of your hard earned money.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought there were lessons to be learned about life in the book.  I also loved that it was being narrated by a dog, which added humor even with the tragedy that befell the family.  If you've ever had a dog living in the house with you as part of your family - not one tied out in the yard, which honestly doesn't count - then you can relate to Enzo.    I read some of the negative comments, and I had to agree with the complaint about the ending being a bit \\"Disney.\\"  I would have preferred an ending where Danny is celebrating a huge win in Italy with Zoe at his side, and they're raising their glasses in a toast to a picture of Enzo taped to the dashboard. On the other hand, while I also understand that we all read into a book and take away from a book things that directly relate to our individual experiences, I feel compelled to comment on some of the complaints.      First - from someone in a book club: \\"The dark drama with the wife and daughter were so off-putting that some of our members didn't even finish the book.\\"    COMMENT: What a pity.  Life isn't always ice cream socials.  Stuff happens, things much worse than what was in this book.  Perhaps these readers were after a heart-warming dog story.  If they had finished the book, they might have been rewarded.  It was heartwarming in spite of the tragedies and the Disney ending.  The true story was about how we handle ourselves when we have those dark moments.      Second:  Too much information on racing.   COMMENT: I thought the racing was what developed the strength of Denny's character and influenced the way he handled his troubles.    Third: The characters weren't developed enough.   Then, from the same review: \\" I just didn't care about Eve at all, I greatly disliked her parents. I could see what they were doing a mile away because I've known people just like this in my real life. The worse they got, the more I cared about Denny.\\"    COMMENT: It appears that the characters were developedenough to evoke an emotional response in this reader.    It's a novel.  Dogs probably don't have such sophisticated thoughts, and they probably aren't concerned with their own mortality or whether or not they have opposable thumbs.  Yet, I have seen dogs do some pretty amazing things that make it clear that sometimes there may be more understanding there than we imagine.     For me, the pleasure I derived from this book came from Enzo's comments about life, his solutions to problems, his own frailties and lapses in control, and from his honesty.  \\"Maybe I'm not ready to be a human, after all,\\" he laments after witnessing the extremes of human emotion, and the way Denny handles himself throughout his trials.  I also love being moved by a story, and I was moved by this one.      Finally:  I agree with another reader:  I knew how the book would end for Enzo, and I dreaded the tears that would come - and they did; but I couldn't wait to see Denny succeed.    Good book.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I used this to listen in on local sports simulcasts when I was out of state. I loved that I was able to pick up the local affiliate and listen to the normal announcers. It also works well for listening to that single radio station that you love on long road trips.<br /><br />The only problem I ran into was that the sports stations kept ending, with TuneIn Radio Pro telling me the event had ended. This prompted me to have to reconnect and buffer again and again, expecially at the end of events.<br /><br />A minor flaw in a great program.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Good buy here! Keeps my Phenom II x4 940BE 125W at 38C in a room that is 80F! And that is with 1 fan. It is quite large but fits in my Rosewill Destroyer Mid-Tower case, which says has 7.5\\" clearance. Actually there is maybe a cm headroom between the cooler and the case cover, taking into account the cpu and mb mounting. The size of this cooler is 6.3\\"H. I have a full size A770de+ mb,and the cooler fan sits about  a mm from the memory, plenty of room for the 2nd fan on the other side. I use ASRock OC Tuner to control fan speed.     My case has the cpu cutout so technically i could just remove the rear panel to install the cooler, but it is easier with this giant to take the mb out. Installation was pretty easy, easier i think than the ones with K8 clips. All you need is a Phillips head screw driver. There is a how-to video on the CM website that is more explanatory than the directions, which they should include a magnifying glass for! I recommend the Arctic Silver 5 Compound, it is much easier to work with than the CM stuff and will not drip over the edge of the cpu. Plus it looks cool.

0143038419|1.0|I really wanted to like this book. It's a great concept turned into a Hollywood film. However, this book is nothing but a long boring rant and soul-searching journey of an annoying, self-centered 35 year old baby. I really wanted to finish it, but couldn't. It's indescribable how awful this book is so I will say that my negative review encompasses the points of all the other negative reviews for this book. Read those reviews instead of the book... It's much more enjoyable.

B004K8WJ3Y|4.0|The reviews of the \\"bluesy\\" sound of this album had me thinking Coverdale and the boys might be returning to that Moody/Marsden early Whitesnake sound, but the music and singing are pretty much the same late-80s blues-metal style the band has followed since their 1987 self-titled album (the only time I've heard Coverdale return to the early Whitesnake sound since the mid-80s was on some of his solo album \\"Into The Light\\"). And for those who note the Zeppelin influence in later Whitesnake, one of the songs on this album (Whipping Boy Blues) sounds an awful lot like Zeppelin's \\"Bring It On Home\\"!   That said, Forevermore is a pretty good late-Whitesnake album, much of it rocks pretty well and Coverdale and the band sound great. Note that I said \\"much\\" of it rocks - there's quite a bit of slower/midpace songs on Forevermore - it doesn't rock nearly as much as \\"Good To Be Bad\\" (which is a fantastic, rocking album) - in fact, the overall pace is as close to \\"Restless Heart\\" as it is to \\"Good To Be Bad\\" - you have to skip a few tracks in the middle if you're in a rockin' mood!   But, they're all good songs, it just gets a little slower in the middle of the album.  Also - maybe because of the replacement rhythm section and session-musician status of the keyboard player - it's also noticeably less heavy than \\"Good To Be Bad\\" (and the new studio tracks from the recent live album); \\"Good To Be Bad\\" was definitely an updated, modern heavy sound, but \\"Forevermore\\" sounds more like the late 80s.   So, if you like 80s style classic rock (hair-metal, pop-metal, hard rock, whatever you want to call it), and you don't need an album to be 80% fast rockers, you should enjoy this. Just don't expect something that rocks like their last album or sounds like the early Moody-era Whitesnake.

It is annoying and complicated for kids.

0143038419|2.0|I had waited to read this book, and had been looking forward to it.  When I got it for a trip home to read on the plane, it turned out to be a big disappointment.  Eventually when I got stuck in one airport for five hours, with nothing to read but this book, I ended up buying a new book as I could not read one more page of it.  The first thing that bothered me about the story was the horrible decisions she made.  I had no connection to the protagonist.  She was not a woman I respected.  Plus her perspective was very indulgent of her behavior and almost bragging, while pretending to be self aware.  This woman just seems to meet gorgeous intelligent men who all want to date her wherever she went.  Which seemed unrealistic for many reasons.  The worst part (I had skipped around hoping to find a part I could tolerate) was the last section on finding the love of her life.  Basically we get to hear about their constant wonderful lovemaking ad nauseam.  It seemed an immature focus of a book written by a woman no longer in her twenties.  Overall I did not find it enlightening or inspiring, just embarrassing.
0345457692|2.0|I very much wanted to like this book, but found it a disappointment. The central character is as cliche as they come - mysterious military/assassin past, tougher than everyone else, etc. The central mystery was intriguing, but the book was all action, all the time, with little character development. It was like reading a book ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS, ALL THE TIME. The main guy goes from battle to battle, each one trying to be more outrageous than the next. Beheading! Rape! Set on Fire! Vivisection! etc. Finishing it was a struggle.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Just a warning for anyone thats going to be buying this from Amazon. I received my package today and guess what! The seal on my Intel i7 box is broken and the CPU is missing!!!!!!   GOD I WAS PISSED OFF! But after I contacted Amazon's customer service I was told I'd get the refund after I return it--the box and the fan that is.  I really hope someone gets fired over this. Now I'm gonna have to wait a whole month before I buy another CPU. Of course, I won't be buying it here... Unless I get an email telling me that they caught whoever did this!    Oh, and by the way, I'm pretty sure this has happened before. I remember reading a review on the i7 980 where the same thing happened. I just thought \\"Oh, that won't happen to me. What are the odds.\\" *sigh*

B004NSULHM|2.0|If Thom Yorke stuck his head in an oh so deep mud puddle and blew real hard into the murky depths would the resultant recorded sound be considered brilliant music by the Radiohead faithful? I suspect so. And that my dears is the problem with Radiohead in 2011 and the new album The King of Limbs. Clocking in at under 38 minutes and with a scant 8 tracks this would have been a nice book-end companion to Yorke's failed solo album The Eraser. At this stage in their career Radiohead can put out just about anything and it will be gobbled up by the faithful like mother's milk. So, I'll confess, I'm an OK Computer Radiohead guy. I love that album. Give me some more guitar fellas, and leave out all the incessant crackling, blipping, and noodling. Much ado about nothing, I say. But let's get down to a track by track assessment to be fair. Bloom starts things off not badly, except for the annoying crackling and popping nonsense built into the percussive effects. A bit of almost classical piano, horns and a trancey feel to this tune. It's OK. Morning Mr. Magpie is more interesting, funky and the guitars chime. I think the way Yorke sings in a cooing way is rather fetching. I quite enjoy the lines \\"You Stole it, give it back\\" -- or something like that. Further along \\"You know you should, but you don't\\" is sung in an out there way that is appealing on a number of levels. The birds chirping at the end -- if those are real birds -- beats computerized bleeps and beeps any day. The next track Little by Little also has guitar, which is encouraging. I like the trippy vibe on this one. Feral is, well, feral. Actually this \\"song\\" is really brutal and epitomizes what's wrong with Radiohead these days. Repetitive nonsense and noise. Press skip and move on. Lotus Flower, which I guess is the single, shows the album moving in a better direction. The reverb-drenched chorus is cool. But this track does meander a bit musically and lyrically. Codex is suberb! The piano is lovely, as are the strings. The song is a slow burner. Yorke intones fairly sweetly on Codex: \\"Glide on...jump off the edge into a cool lake.\\" Indeed; more please! At this point the album has me hooked-in again, briefly. Give Up the Ghost is a wondrous thing. There's acoustic guitar on this song. Like Codex this one just seems to evolve as it goes. The layering of the vocals is particularly effective on this tune and it has an almost, dare I say it, pastoral feel. Separator, the album closer, is a return to the same rather ordinary beats. Not bad, I guess. So 9 albums in Radiohead seems to have found itself in a deep rut and it's one that they may never get out of. You know I can't understand why a band like Radiohead -- with such a thin catalogue of really good music -- can still sell millions of albums while a truly great band like Australia's The Church languishes in relative obscurity. Folks, if you are reading this review and you like guitar-based alternative rock check out The Church's brilliant 23 studio albums. Now, there's a band with legs and enduring greatness.

0802798225|5.0|My summary:<br />Brittany is from a wealthy family, on the outside her life seems perfect but in reality Brittany struggles to keep up apparences. In chemistryclass the teachr announces that they're having a project and Britney gets partered up with Alex Fuentes, a mexican student who also happens to be a gangmember. Everyone knows that the wealthy cacuation inhabitants of the city and the mexicans doesn't intermingle and for Brittany's family this is a disaster. What would their neighbours think if they saw a gangmember knocking on their door? It gets worse.. Brittany falls head over heels for Alex.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />Perfect Chemistry was a beautiful love story. I carried the book with me everywhere and read whenever I had a second to spare. The story reminded me of a modern mix between Westside Story and Romeo & Juliet. Westside Story is the first movie I have a really strong memory of watching actually, I was quite young the first time I saw it. I remember I could cry just thinking of the story for days later.<br /><br />I instantly connected with Brittany as a character, not that I'm like her but her world feels so real and I felt myself empathizing with her. As for Alex he was one likable bad boy, he really wasn't all that bad he was just looking out for his loved ones, I think I fell for him just as hard as Brittany did. He might be up there on my fictional boyfriend list along with Jane Austens Captain Wenthworth.<br /><br />Author Simone Elkeles has taken inspiration from a town near Lake Michigan, where the Caucasian and the Mexican inhabitants in a very little degree interact with each other. Elkeles does something wonderful with her story, she reminds the reader that everything might not be what it appears on the outside. It's not uncommon for young adults to build an image that isn't true to who they really are as a person on the inside.<br /><br />I recommend this book for girls up to 100 years ++

B001152TL6|5.0|Add another piece of the puzzle every time you view this film.  I've seen it like 3 times and I still don't completely get it.  You can analyze it over and over and good luck by the way.  I love all the performances.  Patricia Arquette is one of my favourite actresses and her understated role in Lost Highway is restrained yet bizarre.  I liked the love sequence between her and Bill Pullman while a gothic song is playing in the background. I think it's by Dead Can Dance.  I hope David Lynch makes another weird film, he's one of my favourite directors and he needs to get to work again.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This was money well spent. I love the idea that you get all of the seasons and the two made for T.V. movies.

B004KA9MQO|4.0|Jennifer Hudson, the singer-actress who did not win the American Idol title but went on to win an Oscar, scores a home run with this album. As a vocalist, she ranks very high. The strength of her voice is phenomenal, and I didn't hear a note on this album that she did not nail. The music in general makes me think of 80's and 90's R&B. What I hear is the energy and musicality of Natalie Cole, combined with the assured self-expression of Mary J. Blige. Also very noticeable is the absence of techno, and in its place there is lots of piano, sometimes sounding like that of early 90's club music. However, this does not mean that the album sounds \\"retro\\", but rather \\"classic\\". Like most successful artists, this one has borrowed from the past to create something in the present. Some of the contributing songwriters are Ryan Tedder, R. Kelly, Alicia Keys and Diane Warren. A high level of contemporary energy is prevalent until Track 10, \\"Still Here\\". For this ballad, the actress joins the singer as Jennifer warmly describes a love that has ended, but in a situation which has left her feeling still positive and grounded. The next track, \\"Feeling Good\\", is a Broadway standard from the 60's (\\"Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel\\"), but the arrangement on this album has a bluesy, southern feel. It works. The final track, \\"Believe\\", is very gospel-inflected, which is perfect for Jennifer's voice. Ms. Hudson should be around for a long time if she continues to be the center around which such quality recordings can be produced. This album, and her voice, make me feel good, and that is what it's all about.

0316056863|1.0|I'm amazed at how little substance was in this book. I know Fey was on SNL for years and did movies and such, but the way she relates stories is so uninteresting. No depth, no substance, no attachment, no humor.    I'm not a big Tina Fey fan anyway, but I read this because my wife is a big fan and left this in the bathroom. If it took twenty minutes to read this it was only because I had two phone calls during. I had funnier wipes than this.    Writing humorously is the most difficult form of comedy there is, and I don't mean a skit or play or screenplay. I mean you and the page and the reader. Write something funny. Very difficult, and very difficult, seemingly, for a comedian or comic writer who hasn't had the experience writing anything over a three minute skit.    If it's any consolation, hardly anyone does it well. Not Carlin, Stewart, Maher, Handler, Martin or Steve Allen. Woody Allen comes the closest, but he's hit and miss.    It's like differing types of carpentry. The framer is not the finisher is not the cabinet maker. All use the same tools, all accomplish their job, but all are different.    Fey's different, all right. Not funny, though.
B00000AFFF|5.0|So many musicians, especially pop musicians, grow stale with age. They make one or two great records in their youth, then start recycling the same old thing and become a pale imitation of themselves (or, in the case of Elvis Presley and the Stones, a parody of themselves). How gratifying, then, to find these two masters at the very top of their game. And given their caliber, that means the top of everyone's game. These songs are as strong as anything Burt Bacharach wrote at the height of his years with Dionne Warwick, and, thanks to the influence of Costello, the songs are structurally even deeper and richer than his glory years. Every song has multiple chains of melody, each more compelling than the last, building to indelible choruses. And in classic Bacharach style, those choruses feature startling, even strange harmonic intervals, yet you find yourself humming them all day long (the fact that Bill Frisell covered this album with his own band speaks volumes for the harmonic sophistication on display). I must have listened to this CD a hundred times, and it only sounds fresher and more compelling with each listen. I just can't recommend this highly enough. It's one of the best CDs of the last 20 years.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This is one of those movies where you know, going in, that no one is going to be winning any presigeous awards but the entertainment value is very high! And you'll want to come back for multiple viewings. I know I will! That's it in a nut shell.<br /><br />This should be an awesome exhibition for those of us with home theater setups too!...
B00009PBRP|3.0|I've seen this movie many times before, growing up.  Looked forward to watching it w/ my kids the other weekend.    Got the DVD, and when put in, got the \\"wrong region code\\" error; won't let me play it.  Funny, since I bought it used, from a US vendor, to be delivered to me in CA.    Go figure.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is without a doubt a modern day masterpiece! And, I really love how it just rips the whole fear fueled by the media/fascist government/terrorism by our own government wide open. It is a great film that deals with the freedoms of speech, thought, and religion being stripped away from us in a facist community, allowing a government to rule over the people instead of the people ruling the government, as it was intended when the government for the people, by the people was created.<br /><br />This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to De Palma's \\"The Black Dahlia\\"). The political statements about \\"terrorism\\" and how it can be induced by the very same government that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. Our freedoms are being stripped one by one. This film is about a facist government that installs fear in its people by acts of terrorism, blaming such acts on 'enemy' foreigners, when the acts were committed by the very same government that's supposed to be protecting the people from such terrorist acts; like our own country! I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who knows the REAL reality of our fascist state. It will bring out the 'commie' in most people who oppose our fascist politicians and the ongoing senseless war. This is without a doubt a masterpiece, entertaining and bravely 'open' about our current state of political stance in our 'free' world. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independent, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!<br /><br />People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independent thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song \\"The Mob Rules\\", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"1984\\", \\"Logan's Run\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"They Live\\", \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", \\"Metropolis\\", and Michael Moore's documentary \\"Farenheit 9/11\\", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since \\"Bound\\".<br /><br />We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is considered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We started quickly declining into a fascist state when our former president was in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say \\"Stop!\\" before it's too late. And, it's definitely time to stop all of the hate crimes!<br /><br />This is an important and entertaining movie that you'll want to view over and over. It's political and romantic, and very intelligent. Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure genius! Very well written, brilliantly directed, and intensely acted by a topnotch cast! It is definitely one you will want to own so you can view it over and over, like a favorite album.

B004MWI2M0|4.0|its lego. fun for all ages. over the years, quality got worse and worse, and finally, lego listened to the complants and suggestions of the people that have been buying the product for years. newer set doesnt have loose legs, printing is more even. whats more, the instructions arent dogeared. they come in plastic bags with a board that keeps them flat.    lego has made lots of collabs over the years. they made toy story, prince of persia, indiana jones, and even batman.  this newest edition (but soon to be old, cars 2 legos is coming out) happens to be the pirates of the caribbean series. it came out just in time for the forth movie, on stranger tides.    this particular set is from the second movie, dead man's chest. it features the bell tower where will turner and admiral norrington fight over the key to the chest, and the wheel of the mill that contains studs on the inside and outside for your minifigs to be placed inside of for play or show. this set is missing the lil part of the columns from the movie where most of the swordplay takes place.    this set contains 3 minifigs. you get jack sparrow, admiral norrington in beat up clothing, and hadras - the crewman from the flying dutchman whose head gets knocked off and turns into a hermit crab (which is unique currently onto to this set).  a new component for legos, is that they have \\"sling\\" shaped pieces that are placed like a messenger bag over the character, which allows them to hold their swords in their sides, when not in use.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Using this with the cheap but good quality pre-amp from ART (around $30), see my review there as well.  Before this purchase I didn't know a whole lot about the various types of Microphones and cabling and pre amps and amps and balanced versus unbalanced but finally have a setup that works though requires a pre-amp. Some things to consider:    1. Use a pre-amp for any dynamic cardiod mic (like Behringer xm8500). Low impedance microphones like xm8500 require pre-amps or perform better. Without the pre-amp, I had to turn my receiver full max to barely get any sound from it and I was afraid I was going to pop/blow the speakers if I switched inputs by mistake     2. Phantom power is NOT required for this Mic.  This is not a condensor mic     3. Use XLR male to XLR female cable between Mic and pre-amp. I had ordered XLR to 1/4 headphone jack cable and even though it physically connected to the 1/4 input on the pre-amp, the gain was not sufficient (has to do with impedance, balanced versus unbalanced and so on)     4. The output from the pre-amp can be either 1/4 or XLR, I am using XLR to 1/4 cable (I had one so why not) and then a 1/4 female to RCA into my receiver. Of course if I wanted to, I could use a different connector to plug into my computer and record if I need to (haven't tried it yet)     Now that I know this, it all seems so trivial but I hope it helps someone who wants to just setup a decent Mic for vocals cheaply. The Mic is flawless and I am quite happy with it.  It seems good quality for the price.    Happy singing.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|I cannot believe this movie got nominated for Best Picture and that Natalie Portman got Best Actress.  She was like a wooden soldier walking around, so uptight I wanted to strangle her.  It seemed to have gratuitous nastiness for people who maybe like that kind of thing.  I kept wishing for a little lightness of being, humor, real feeling, but instead gagged at the awful scenes like Natalie watching blood roll off her back where she dug her nails in, or her boss trying to show her how to seduce him.  This was a gutter movie.  Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and just stopped it about 1/2 way.  I have better things to do than be grossed out.

B003UYUP6M|5.0|Every page of Mr. Levy's book is packed with detailed information about Google's technology and business, certainly detailed enough to reveal the essence of each topic.  Yet, as one zips through the book, reading and learning, one finds it to be entirely effortless, highly enjoyable and thoroughly absorbing.<br /><br />To structure the material, Mr. Levy chose to associate the presentation of each topic with the story of one of the key people who worked on it.  So, as the account of the development of the company's technology proceeds, the reader is introduced to a cast of characters, and simultaneously learns about the culture of the company and the sort of folk who work there.<br /><br />\\"In the Plex\\" joins \\"Dreaming in Code\\" and \\"Renegades of the Empire\\" at the top of my list of books about the business of software.

B001HPP2XW|4.0|It used to be that iconic actors and actresses were thought to have no need to resemble the characters that they were meant to portray.  If Renee Zellweger had assumed the role of Bridget Jones 50 years ago, you would have have been presented with the contradiction of a pole-thin British woman who spoke like she grew up in Texas--though, nevertheless, generally considered to be a bit overweight.  I wonder what southerner Truman Capote made of his hillbilly girl gone Yankee gold digger, but speaking as if she had taken elocution lessons from Henry Higgens (evidently a foreshadowing of things to come)?  Perhaps if Rex Harrison had shown up as Audrey Hepburn's erstwhile husband instead of Buddy Ebsen (whose role in The Beverly Hillbillies was probably launched by this movie), I might have been able to accept the central premise of this film.  But upon first seeing this movie on TV as a young teen, I was completely confused by Ebsen's appearance (\\"What is Jed Clampett doing here?\\").  As it turned out, however, Ebsen might have been the only actor able to play his role credibly in this movie, with the others seeming to have beamed down from an orbiting spacecraft populated by beings whose only knowledge of Earth came from movies made before 1968.  As for Peppard's character, although I could easily imagine him as a sort of boy-toy, he did not strike me as an inspiring young writer.  Still, I have chosen to give this film four stars in light of the limitations imposed by the gendre that it represents--that of the American equivalent to Kabuki theater.  Also, the casting of this film might be credited with elucidating the enigma of Jed Clampett's seeming lack of interest in finding a wife in Beverly Hills. After all, once a character is identified as the ex-husband of the heavenly Ms. Hepburn, to what other woman's company would he care to aspire?
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|This is a great show and fun to watch!  I thought the concert/tour was pretty good and this video captures the band at a critical time when they were getting their \\"act\\" together...worth the money and multiple watches and a great addition to the collection!
B004SEUJK0|5.0|One of the things that continues to amaze me about good actors is the transformation they undergo as they assume a role.  My wife once made the observation that I found Renee Zellweger really attractive.  As I tried to explain, however, it is not Ms. Zellweger the person or the woman who I find attractive--although it may be a character that she opts to play.  The horribly mercenary woman that she played in \\"Chicago\\" was ghastly--and also really too skinny.  I liked her in \\"Jerry McGuire\\" and \\"Nurse Betty\\"--but in \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" she really hit her stride--at least as far as I am concerned!  I am not talking as if I imagine myself to be be a film connaisseur--I just know what I like and what I find attractive--and the character that Ms. Zellweger embodies in this movie seems truly wonderful to me.  The Yiddish word \\"Zaftig\\" (i.e. juicy) conveys for me what might be called the \\"well-fed farm girl look\\" that Ms. Zellweger has achieved here.  And I can't say that this is my ideal concept of feminine beauty--but in this case it just seems to work!  I loved her awkward introduction of Salmon Rushdie at a publisher's event, as well as her confused appearance at a party dressed as a Playboy bunny because somebody had erroneously informed her that the theme would be the ever-fascinating \\"Vicars and Tarts\\".  Not all of Bridget's tastes appeal to me.  Smoking--forget it!  And tiger striped panties are not what I would consider \\"sexy knickers\\".  But her inappropriate frankness and endearing insecurity are traits that I find strangely attractive.  As Colin Firth's character said, here is what I would change about her: nothing (except for the smoking).
B00503BN1M|3.0|I consider myself to be a solid judge of a movie based on the previews, and this movie's previews definitely piqued my interest.  As a single woman, begrudgingly falling into the stereotype, I'm always seeking a good love story that I can relate to. Unfortunately, I felt that this one fell flat. A decent overall movie to watch on a rainy day, but a uninspiring storyline.
B0050SS1EE|5.0|I totally agree with Tony T and I never will forget Smallville. This is, and ever will be, my most favorite show. A decade is a long time for a TV series (especially one on CW). Therefore, I am honored to have witnessed the development of a clumsy, unsure, superpowered teenage boy who finds out he's from another planet. His exploratory journey featured some struggles between emotions and duty, selfishness, and trials. But most importantly, we got awesome beatdowns, supervillans, superheroes, the world's best sidekicks and companions. And OMG, all that is covered in that short amount of time. So, if you're not a Smallville fan, but a Superman fan, you still need to watch it. All great journeys must come to an end. This marvelous journey ends with our hero realizing that he is the only one that can save the world that he has come to love. Of course we(fans) all knew that 10 years ago, but we cheated. Clark needed a little extra time and I appreciate the delay. Thanks to all involved for a decade of SuperAwesomeness!
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|In which Dylan adopts a less mysterious persona and lets the listener inside by bringing his actual life into his art. On a few cuts, his family life gets played out through mature eyes and it affirms him savoring this simpler existence. Yet he's slippery enough to sneak in two lightweight closers concerning religion that still might edify those who hear them. Piano and organ dominate the sound proceedings with Dylan and sessionman extraordinare, Al Kooper, divvying up the chores. This enhances its diversity and scope. There are bursts of blues, gospel, folk and rock fervor. His robust vocals, blending raspiness with sweetness, help make this one of Dylan's best albums. It gets off to a good launch with the already-standard \\"If Not For You\\". But it's the several great obscurities that put this over. With \\"Sign on the Window\\" his idyll is building a cabin in Utah where he finds a wife, has kids and catches rainbow trout. \\"One More Weekend\\" is Dylan at his bluesy strongest with just him and his wife taking it on the lam, away from the kids. He enthuses of the time he grabbed his honorary doctorate from Princeton on \\"Day of the Locusts\\". Above everything else, maybe, is the jazzy eccentricity of \\"If Dogs Run Free\\". Al's piano and Maeretha Stewart's skatting threaten to upstage Bob's spoken vocal. Synergy speaks! His credibility as an artist continues to be proven by not mirroring himself to his mid-sixties heyday. And this album seems symbolic of his survival instincts and his needs.
B004GHBQCE|5.0|I have never reveiwed an album before but when I saw that this album did not have any reviews on it I had to add one.  This album is amazing and contains some of the most heartfelt music you will ever hear. Hurt and Personal Jesus are both wonderful.

B00080ETV8|5.0|I have seen every version of Jane eyre created. This by far is the most accurate of all the many versions put on film. Though some may dissagree. I think Timothy Dalton  is fierce yet vulnerable and as another reveiwer put it perfectly. Yes he is good looking, yet craggy enough that he fits to perfection the part of \\"tortured\\" Mr Rochester. Yes there are faults with the mini series, the early 1980s lighting is a bit too sterile and bright,that is bleaches out many contrasts and drama to the landscape of the film. Mr Rochesters charge, Aldele whom Jane teaches has a very poor french accent, her very british accent is very evident as she speaks her brief lines in french. Aside from all those minor things, I do like the feeling and the trueness this film has to the book. It takes you in from the moment you start to finish.  It really is wonderful.<br /><br /> Other Jane Eyre versions I like are the recent one done wirh Toby Stevens. Though it has a more contemporary take on the story of Jane. It really is very refreshing to view. I also like the 1944 Orson Wells version for its gothic victorian film Noire style. The most recent version is fairly nice too, but The actor who plays Rochester is too wooden for my taste. It is well worth a watch too however.<br /><br />To conlude. Yes do purchse this the 1983 version of JaneEyre with Tomothey Dalton. You will not be dissapointed.

B003TXSF5C|3.0|First, I am a big fan of Stephen Hawking.  I've followed his theories since I was in high schol (back when he could still speak on his own).  A Brief History of Time was absolutely wonderful.  I had high hopes for The Grand Design.  Unfortunately, I came away from it feeling somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />I am not a physicist or mathematecian.  But I am fairly educated, and I anticipate that Hawking wrote this book not for the professional physicist, but rather for the mass market fan of science and physics (yes, those people actually exist).  I have a rudimentary working knowledge of physics and math, so I wouldn't say the book was over my head, although some parts of it were daunting.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that Hawking spends most of the book describing past theories of the universe, such as the Ancient Greek, or Mayan civilization, or religious theories, and builds up to being able to refute them through science.  He never gets there.  It is impossible to prove that God did not create the universe, and Hawking does not claim this.  He only claims that it is not necessary to involve God in a theory when science is perfectly capable of explaining everything.  Here is the spoiler:  The universe we experience is only one of 10 to the 500th power of the number of universes that can exist, and we just happen to have developed on a planet with a certain eliptical orbit and distance from a sun/star of a certain power at a certain period of time in history.  All of this combines to form the neccessary elements of life, and evolution takes it from there.  However, all of the theories seem to be assumptions built upon assumptions.  For example, quarks are the building blocks of subatomic particles such as neutrons and protons.  However, quarks cannot be isolated.  Thus, sub atomic particles, such as quarks, mesons, bosons, etc. are mathematical principles used to explain anomolies in the data.  We assume they exist because doing so fits the data.  Also, he relies heavily on Feynmann's theories of quantum physics.  In the famous double-slit test, Hawking describes that the pattern of interference lead Feynmann to believe that the particles, or \\"bucky-balls\\" don't just take both paths through the slits, but they take all possible paths.  This is the basis of Feynmann's \\"alternative histories\\" theory.  However, bucky-balls are 60 carbon atom balls, which on the grand scheme of atomic physics, is like a beach ball.  Why can't we create bucky-balls using a radioative carbon, like carbon 13 or carbon 14 and use a radiographic analysis to see where the particles actually go, instead of theorizing that they go everywhere in the universe at once?<br /><br />At the end of the day, Hawking states that the universes come into and out of existence spontaneously, as long as the energies balance out correctly.  It is in this wehre our universe has been formed.  We are a statistical anaomoly.  Also, while the big bang is assumed to be true, we cannot study the big bang itself because it is a singularity.  So again, we assume it.  I certainly am not advocating that its the big bang or God, but I don't think Hawking goes far enough to prove his thesis, and in postulating spontaneous generation of universes, leaves the eager reader feeling somewhat underwhelmed.eynmann's theories of quantum physics.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I've read the reviews by people who don't think this movie is true to the original series as well as those reviews that think it is one of the best movies made of the saga.  I am solidly in the second camp.  I grew up watching all the original TV shows first run on TV, then watching them again several times in rerun.  They were great for a sci-fi buff but only a die hard Trekie would not admit that the TV show was at times campy and downright bad.  Remember in first run it was marginally successful for the network and only in reruns did it start to take on a cult status. This movie restarts the franchise in a very good way. My family and I have watched this movie five times and because of this movie, my kids got interested in the original TV shows.  This movie will bring the next generation of youth into watching the TV show where they may have never considered it otherwise.  For this reason alone, Trekies should respect what this movie accomplishes or someday there will be no more fans left alive.      The only problem with the Blu Ray version of this movie is the sound quality.  It was mastered poorly and seems more than just dumbed down to CD quality of 16bits and 48kHz.  That is all the good old CD does but CD's go back to the 1980's and the computing power and recording industry has come a long ways. Really good sound on Blu Ray can be done at the same standard as modern recording studios which is a much higher 24bits 176kHz digital signal.  For those of us who have a few thousand dollars invested in a quality surround sound system the difference in sound quality is dramatic; almost as big as the difference between low-def TV and high-def TV.     I'm not sure what was going on here with the mastering of the sound of this movie.  I have CD's that sound very good and the sound of this movie is not great.  It seem compresed. If it was that way with the original movie then they need to hire a better sound crew.  If it was goofed up in the process of converting to Blu Ray, then I hope someday they fix it. I did not take a star away for this because the movie itself is do darn good.
B001PBRCVI|5.0|July 1942 marked a dark period in the history of France where thousands of Jewish families were rounded up and forcibly kept in the Velodrome d'Hiver. They were then sent off to transit camps in France such as Drancy, before being packed off to Auschwitz, a Nazi death camp. What is disturbing about this whole incident is that the rounding up and mobilization of Jews for deportation was done by the French authorities.<br /><br />Based upon this seldom mentioned, little known piece of French history, author Tatiana de Rosnay has crafted a well-written novel that alternates between the past in 1942, and the present. The past centers around a 10 year old Jewish girl Sarah Strazynski who is forced to go to the Velodrome d'Hiver with her mother and father, innocently leaving behind a 4 year old brother Michel locked in a secret cupboard with the assurance that she would return to let him out when it was safe.<br /><br />The present revolves around writer Julia Jarmond, a transplanted American who is married to a frenchman and finds herself being consumed by the story of the Vel d'Hiv incident. As she digs deeper, she uncovers dark secrets surrounding her husband's family which are connected to the deportations of Jews from France. As the truth emerges, the author deftly handles the question of guilt caused by supressed secrets and how the truth can sometimes not only bring about pain and disrupt the regularity of life, yet also have the ability to heal and move forwards into the future.<br /><br />The method employed by the author, which alternates between the past [1942] and the present is an effective tool for it ties both periods together and brings the story to a satisfying conclusion. I do confess though that I found the story of the past much more dramatic and interesting than the one which deals with Julia in the present. On the whole though, it was an engrossing read and I would recommend it, especially to those interested in the genre. I'd also recommend the following books which deal with the Holocaust and France: \\"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews\\" by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction), \\"One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France\\" by Fred Gross (memoir), and \\"France:The Dark Years, 1940-1944\\" by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period).ith the Holocaust and France: \\"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews\\" by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction), \\"One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France\\" by Fred Gross (memoir), and \\"France:The Dark Years, 1940-1944\\" by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period).

B00008A7QK|5.0|OK. I personnaly think \\"Bang A Gong\\" is one of the absolutely greatest three minutes in history...sleezy, sexy, and oh, so perfect! Suprise! The whole of the album delivers on that promise and produces swagger enough for all! Glam? Yeah, we got it. Damned great rock 'n roll? Nothing is better. Necessary.
0060989157|5.0|First of all, I was never a Motley Crue fan. I spent the summer of 1989 in Los Angeles and saw all these bands that looked like Motley Crue and I was over it. Fast forward 20 years and I've read a lot of rock biographies, but then I picked up this one and could not put it down. It was almost a trashy novel with more twists and turns than most fictional books. The fact that the book was written with all the members point of view was a masterstroke. It really gave them a character they had to play. It's tragic, funny, heartbreaking, but it worked for me because it touched me. Amazing stuff!!
B004HGBUVG|4.0|I thought \\"Car Wheels On A Gravel Road\\" was the most dangerous and erotic song ever but this new stuff is almost as good. \\"Copenhagen\\" will make you swell out of your ordinary world of \\"whatever\\" and deliver you to places that are sumptious and frightning. Oh, and oddly erotic! You must, I repeat MUST grab this one. Ragged and polished. You go, Lucinda!
B002LCOQS2|2.0|To retrieve the name 'Techno Pop' is quite illusive, knowing the fact it was released originally as 'Electric Cafe'. Yes, 'Techno Pop' sounds more consumer friendly a title, but 'Electric Cafe' made its contents less obvious - and a bit more intriguing. Not necessarily with a common theme like any of their previous album up to that point, still 'Electric Cafe' was a nice excursion into the future world, graphically (if not entirely musically) stripped down to its bare minimum.     It's nice to see a bit improved outer/inner front cover graphics, with four computer-generated, severed heads floating in a black vacuum - but in all, additional image memorabilia (especially from this fascinating 3d set produced by Rebecca Allen and Steve Di Paola) could have been more representative of this era for the band. Instead, Kraftwerk played a little too much with 'less is more' here - basically a mere fragment of the fascinating video 'Musique Non Stop', mainly displaying Ralf and Florian's face segments (at least the two have shown some dignity of keeping the original contributors on this album's artwork - Karl and Wolfgang - intact), while some of the images inside the booklet look like bad jpeg reproductions (the images reproduced provide larger pixel display).    And now for the contents - 'Techno Pop' is still a brilliant electronic album that won't age. But the sad part, it is a forced 'Techno Pop' album. Because the contents are slightly changed. One thing I am glad about Kraftwerk's albums - they DO NOT include bonus material. Bonus material would just make these albums a cheap collection of scrap. Kraftwerk made too many concept albums, with a common theme to keep some six to seven pieces together. A perfect dose.    'Techno Pop' ommits the original, and far more brilliant 8-minute version of 'The Telephone Call' (which is a shame) to a far more inferior, shortened remix of the song, plus its deadly boring variant 'House Phone' - which shows only how stupid the idea ofincluding any bonus would be. If you decide to collect the remasters, 'Techno Pop' makes inevitable part of the series and in its own right it turns out to be 'unique' - but if you are not into collecting the entire set or these, I still recommend you should check \\"Electric Cafe\\". Because that's the original album - on 'Techno Pop' there isn't much to miss.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I wanted to like this book. I really tried to like this book.  In the end, though, I am left with few good things to say about the book.    I first noticed this novel when it started appearing in best seller lists and then started gaining praise in the blogosphere, especially on Goodreads. Then, people began asking me if I had read it; and, when I responded in the negative, they proceeded to rave about it, using phrases like, \\"deeply disturbing\\", \\"amazing\\", \\"moving\\", and \\"powerful\\".   \\"Wow\\", I thought, \\"I need to read this.\\"    And so I did. I downloaded Emma Donoghue's much lauded book to my Kindle on Tuesday, 17 May and read for about twenty minutes. The narrator's voice (the one thing most people rave about when discussing this book) was grating and inauthentic. There were so many discrepancies in his five year old voice. The voice alternates between a partially literate 5 year old who refers to all nouns as proper nouns and an eloquent, articulate most decidedly NOT five year old voice.  The unnecessary capitalization was distracting and tedious to read. \\"Stick it out\\" said my friends--\\"the narration and capitalization will all make sense, the longer you read, the more it will grow on you.\\"    I concede that an adult writing in a child's voice is a difficult undertaking, one few authors succeed in.  Mark Haddon is a notable exception to this rule. However, constant references to \\"silly penis\\" and \\"melted spoon\\" were not cute or endearing, they were just downright annoying.  Further, I don't understand the narrator's obsession with Left and Right--a five year old breastfeeding, really?  There was no need for this, as the characters were provided with food--it's not as if this was his only option for survival.    On Wednesday, 18 May, I picked up the book again and this time, read about 60% of it. The voice did grow on me, in the same way a canker sore might grow on me. Beyond that, the plot itself was meandering and often unbelievable. Mid-way through the book, when readers finally see our main characters leave the room is one of the most unbelievable, sloppy plot contrivances I've ever seen.  After that, the book goes even further downhill.  Life outside the room is not much more exciting than life in the room. What does change outside is the relationship between mother and son. The mother, previously dependent upon her son to the point of obsessiveness (as evidenced by the breastfeeding) seems to resent her son and to want to be separated from him.    On Thursday, 19 May, I finished the book; and promptly wished for the time I spent reading it back.  Cursory research showed me that the plot had been based on several well-publicized cases involving kidnappings and abductions. This made me snort, as there is a line in the book indicating that those who profit on the tragedies of others are heartless.  Oh, the irony.    The book's plot is drawn out in some spots, rushed in spots where it should not be. It is full of plot holes and bizarre inconsistencies. I wanted to like it, I really did--but I did not.  Not even a little bit.     (..)
B004SKLD9A|2.0|This new blu-ray has horrid video encoding and audio mixes. There is another one on amazon that has the 5.1 Dolby Digital and true 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It still isn't the best (the japan release has the best audio mixes.) But it is better than this one. [[ASIN:B002HFWAWW Equilibrium [Blu-ray]]] That's the one I got. It is the Canadian release done by Alliance(has double sided box art one in english one in french) and is actually good.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Pro Elite Wireless Controller for PS3  Let me start out by saying that if you're one of the crazy people with baby hands out there who loves the Dual Shock 3, steer clear of this controller and stop reading this review. If you're like me, however, and you like to use a controller that doesn't add a barrier between you and the video games you love so much, continue on.  I'll go on record and say that the Xbox 360 controller is the best controller ever designed by man (minus the horrific D-pad). It fits perfectly in the hands, all controls are within reach, triggers function flawlessly, etc. After a minute or two, you forget you're holding a controller and it stays that way until you put it down. The Dual Shock 3 controller is possibly the worst designed controller on this planet. I've heard people say that the N64 controller deserves that award, but I never owned an N64, so can't confirm or deny that. The Dual Shock 3's thumbsticks are awkwardly placed and seem to be coated with Teflon. The triggers are worthless (which explains why all games use L1 and R1 for shooting related duties). The controller itself is entirely too small, unless you have baby hands. Constant adjustment is required to attempt to keep it comfortable, although it's ultimately futile. Fingers are bunched up in the back due to lack of room. Pushing the L and R buttons requires super-dexterity if controlling the thumbsticks. I could go on and on. Suffice it to say, the person that designed the DS3 should probably be whipped with 1,000 USB cables.  Along comes the Pro Elite Wireless Controller for PS3. They've essentially tried to copy the design of the 360 controller, although not quite to a T. Overall the controller feels pretty good in your hands. The matte black finish is nice. The build quality seems good. The left thumbstick is where it should be, off to the side. The face buttons have a nice backlight that can be turned on or off, a nice little touch. The triggers are infinitely better than on the DS3. Unfortunately, most games force you to use R1 to shoot and don't give an option to change that. It's pretty annoying having decent triggers at your disposal, and having no choice but to use the buttons above them to fire a gun. I wish Power A would have taken this into consideration and perhaps put switches on the controller allowing you to swap the 1s and 2s.  The Pro Elite is definitely a win and a huge step up from the DS3, but it's not without flaws. I'm not a huge fan of the grip where your palms rest, but you get used to it. The placement of the right thumbstick is a little farther inside than it probably should be, making it a bit of a reach if you have smaller hands. The controller requires a dongle connected to the console, which seems silly, but maybe it's the only way to do it without Sony's blessing. This prevents you from turning the system on with the controller. It's a little bit on the light side. Some heft would make it feel a bit more solid, but that's a preference thing. Lastly, my biggest gripe is with the thumbsticks. The dead zones are a bit larger than they should be. It's not a deal-breaker, but it's definitely noticeable.  In closing, if you like games and hate the DS3, based on my research it looks like this is probably the best you can get, short of building Ben Heck's PS360 controller (or better yet, paying him to do it). Some slight modifications on the design, fixing the dead zone issues and making it Bluetooth and this controller would be a perfect 10. As of right now, though, it's only about an 8. Which is still good, but not perfect.
0300169787|5.0|This book is stunning, in every aspect. It is beautifully bound, printed and it is a bargain! Absolute must have for any fans of McQueen! The photographs are in abundance and very masterfully taken. It is such a joy to flip through this book and be given insight on McQueen's inspiration or processes. This book will be highly treasured in my collection!
B0041EVYVK|5.0|I first heard Black Dub doing an in studio live performance on a Morning Becomes Eclectic podcast. I really liked their sound so I ordered the CD.<br /><br />On the first listen I liked the CD but not as much as the live show. Over the next month I have listened to it several more times. What finally made it a five star CD for me was when I listen to the music concentrating on the Rhythm section. They are great together. Focusing on the drums and bass and letting the guitar, vocals and production flow in around that pushes this CD into a great listening experience.<br /><br />This one does require some patience to get into it. Their songs are not very hook oriented so they don't grab you right away but well worth multiple listens.
B004JKMDHA|3.0|If you are a fan of the ORIGINAL Fleetwood Mac, this CD might be just what you are looking for. I bought this knowing that the songsmp were from that era so I wasn't disappointed. The cover implies that Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks perform on this CD. That's not the case. If you buy this, you will be getting the early works of the band that predates the Rumours era lineup and even Bob Welch.
0064430170|5.0|I am thrilled to have this book to give to my Granddaughter. I read it to my daughter, now she can read it to hers. The circle of life and all that. The shipping was really, really fast, book was in perfect condition. Thanks.
0316098329|5.0|Other reviewers have provided plot summaries, so I'll just add that I think what makes this book so compelling is its exploration of opposing forces: captivity/freedom, parent/child, Inside/Outside, self/other, etc.  This book raises hard questions about these concepts that makes us re-examine our beliefs about them.  For example, once Ma and Jack engineer their Great Escape from captivity, are they really free?  Was Jack free-er Inside or Outside?  Where are the psychological boundaries between parent and child?  (This last question, by the way, is probably best symbolized by the references to Jack's breastfeeding at age 5, a fact that seems to have left some people pretty disturbed, but I think its an important detail precisely because it simultaneously establishes a clear parent/child relationship but also blurs the boundaries between self and other.)      Overall, a book that lingers on in thought for days afterwards.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Jack Black stars as Po, a goofy, lovable loser panda who suddenly has destiny call to him to be the \\"dragon warrior,\\" much to the chagrin of the much more skilled warriors. Black does a solid job of giving personality to Po, making his status as underdog come to life, as he stumbles, and bumbles his way alternately through skills tests and stuffing his face. The master often laments, \\"There are no accidents\\", but when you see Po's \\"skills\\", you begin to wonder if the master could be wrong.     Kung Fu Panda is a great family film. It does have a few minor parts of crude humor, but where it excels is in its entertainment value, personality, and ultimate message about belief in fulfilling your goals or dreams. So often you watch animated films that force the sentimental moments and they come off as a little too forced or cheesy, but Kung Fu seems very genuine in the way it presents life's lessons in not giving up.

B004SKLD9A|1.0|The whole point of BluRay is that the people who have it are in it for the best most accurate picture available. you release the incorrect aspect ratio for the people who still have VCR's and rabbit ear tv's... unacceptable. To cut a 2:35 aspect ratio to 1:77... UNACCEPTABLE. What a piece of crap. A hidden gem like this movie is deserves so much better. This company should be ashamed of themselves.

0307887960|2.0|I wanted to make sure that, before reviewing this book, I had completed several weeks of the diet, in order to actually speak to the results.  Having read it, gone through the first \\"Attack\\" phase (3-5 days of nothing but lean protein, pinpointed more accurately on the Dukan website), and transitioned to the second phase (a month or so of lean protein alternated with lean protein+veggies), I can say that the diet did not work for me as it was offered.  To be more accurate, I GAINED five lbs on the Attack phase, which is billed as a \\"radical transformation in your body,\\" and as a rapid weight loss phase.  So here are the reasons I think this was not the diet for me:    - I am a vegetarian.  Dukan devotes several pages to explaining how vegetarians can follow the diet as well as anyone, and even recommends specific foods.  So I went right out and bought gobs of those recommended foods, such as nonfat cottage cheese, morningstar farms grillers, etc.  And they were delicious!  Eating those things was no problem, at least until I got pretty bored with them.  Even then, I ate nothing but what he had listed (the above, plus egg whites, very low fat string cheese, sugar free treats, low sugar soy milk, Greek yogurt with a tablespoon of oat bran everyday, made one attempt to made the disgusting oat galette, etc).    - I have hit a weight loss plateau, after losing 75lbs (from 220lbs to 145lbs) a few years ago.  I gained a little bit back in the years since, and was looking to trim and tone from this diet, especially after a long and indulgent winter.  For me, it's really hard to figure out how to cut any more calories from my day without being exhausted or feeling famished, mainly because...    - I workout.  A LOT.  The Attack phase definitely left me too tired and feeling woozy to do my normal routine of 45mins of cardio and 30-60mins of circuit weight training every day, so that week I skipped the gym and instead walked the dog at least 50 minutes a day.  Still, I found myself getting winded at the slightest walk up my stairs, and my muscles just didn't want to work.  Even worse, my brain just felt sluggish.  High protein diets are staples of body builders (research shows they help burn fat and gain muscle), but without glucose provided by veggies or carbs, it's really hard to get your body fueled properly.  I spoke to some trainers at the gym (one with a PhD in exercise physiology), and they all strongly recommended that I at LEAST add veggies and fruit to the diet.  Thus, after the Attack phase was over (3 days according to the Dukan site, but I gave it 5 days because I didn't see any results), I took their advice and started eating lean protein+veggies+fruit.  Dukan's prescribed diet just wasn't for me.    HOWEVER, in the long run, I DID change my eating habits.  I was eating a lot of bagels and drinking a few glasses of wine with dinner every night before I started the Dukan diet.  The radical shift that happened when I ate nothing but lean protein all day (Attack phase) was enough to make me realize that I wasn't getting enough protein.  In addition, by snacking on a lot of carbs all day, I was creating a lot of blood sugar spikes and false feelings of hunger, even after having eaten 1500+ calories for the day.  So one of the nice take-aways I had from this book was the shift from carb-based eating to protein-based eating.  I'm making significantly more of an effort to eat tons of lean protein, and I HAVE lost 7 lbs since the Attack phase ended.  I can't say it's all the Dukan plan, however, since I eat all the veggies I want everyday, as well as fruit and even the (very) occasional [[ASIN:B003NTZ9LU Arnold's Select Sandwich Thins - 100% Whole Wheat, 8 ct. bag (Pack of 4)]].  My body needs more than the Dukan plan offers, but responds well to the significant reduction in carbs that's more consistent with the [[ASIN:1439190275 New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great.]].    So, all and all, I think it might be great for some people (probably best for meat eaters).  I count calories everyday as a routine on my iPhone, and I can say it's well nigh impossible to get more than 1400 calories everyday from lean protein.  You feel STUFFED by about 1100 calories, which is nice.  If you can handle the side effects of tiredness, bad breath, food boredom, and (at least for me) a possible increase in weight in the beginning, this could be a long-term solution for you, simply because you will find it so hard to eat more calories than you burn on a daily basis.  I also can say that, by avoiding all carbohydrates, my IBS and lactose sensitivity just disappeared, leading me to do more research into cutting gluten out of my diet completely.  If you like structure and can handle a huge shift in your eating habits, this is the plan for you.  I can only offer up my experience, though, and say that by adding back all of the fruits and veggies during the \\"Cruise\\" phase (really, by just skipping to a modified Stabilization phase, similar to what he suggested for teenagers and children), I was a LOT happier with both the efforts and the results. However, this isn't what he recommends (he constantly reminds you to follow the diet to the letter), so I can't review the diet any higher than two stars.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|What a fantastic app. It quite literally does stream practically everything out there from local stations around the world to thousands of shoutcast streams to podcasts. It's even got dvr-like functionality allowing you to pause, fast forward, rewind and even record. Shows album art and program schedules where supported and also has a great alarm function. The only radio streams this doesn't do are last.fm and pandora but that's totally understandable and acceptable given all that this already converges together and presents in a beautiful and intuitive user interface. My elderly mother could work this app without much coaching so it's dead simple. Spend a buck, these guys deserve it and you wont regret it. I got this on amazon when it was free and I wish I could pay for it now because its so good.
B004OEIL54|4.0|Finally we get all the SCREAM films on blu ray and here we have the first and best that was hugely original and put a much needed original kick in the horror movie genre.  We all know the story and we also know that when an older classic film comes out on a blu ray transfer it is really important to find out the quality and if the transfer succeeded.  I was thrilled when I popped this movie into my blu ray player and was itching to see the infamous opening scene with Drew Barrymore.  Sadly it was a huge disappointment.  The audio was great but the video totally lacked clarity and seemed blury and overly grainy.  For me the full effect of the scene was lost.  Luckily when we get to the next scene with Neve Campbell at her computer the video had hugely improved.  The picture was pretty crisp, colors were vibrant, flesh tones realistic and I was then impressed.  Throughout the rest of the movie the video quality gets about a B.  The dark scenes work well.  Black and white ratio is clean and the colors do blend in well.  The graininess after the opening scene is there on purpose and looks fine.  When the villian dashes in and out of the picture the black and white of the costume looks great.  But the part of the movie that is a truly huge improvement over the dvd is the audio.  The DTS HD Master 5.1 audio track uses all surround speakers to full effect.  Dialogue is crisp and you will be jumping out of your seat in all the right moments.  The track is perfect for this classic horror movie and shines.  The soundtrack blends in with all the films sounds perfectly.<br /><br />But the video is where opinions will clash.  For me the upgrade to blu ray is much better than my dvd version.  I never liked the dvd presentations and the blu ray is in a 1080p enhanced widescreen which makes viewing the film better.  There is some fine detail but the picture overall just does not POP like a quality blu ray does.  I think when most people watch a blu ray they want that crispness and clarity that just makes it far surpass the dvd.  It can become almost like you are in the movie.  I think people forget the film is 15 years old and overall the picture is acceptable but the poor quality of the opening scene just leaves it lacking for me.  When the movie is offered on blu ray at a steal price which Amazon seems to be doing now it is definitely worth a buy but if you are pretty satisfied with a dvd version you own I would think before purchasing it at full price.that just makes it far surpass the dvd.

B004L35GAQ|4.0|My relationship with AWOLNATION actually started back in 2006 when Aaron Bruno was part of a different band called Under The Influence Of Giants. They did one self-titled album (which I own) and called it quits. In looking up what UTIOG had become I saw that Aaron Bruno had formed AWOLNATION. So I figured what the heck, and bought \\"Megalithic Symphony\\" since I liked UTIOG.<br /><br />\\"Megalithic Symphony\\" is a pretty solid album with only a few missteps such as the first two opening tracks, both less than a minute each. Not a sharp way to start out. Plus the interlude at track 9. That leaves 12 tracks, and it would have been better just to eliminate those other three tracks. That being said, the only weak tracks here are \\"Guilty Filthy Soul\\" and \\"Wake Up\\". \\"Soul Wars\\" also gets a little old after repeated listens. The rest is one solid track after the next. In fact, \\"Megalithic Symphony\\" is unusually strong coming from Aaron Bruno, who is not a household name, and who has not sold millions of records.<br /><br />The best thing that could be said about \\"Megalithic Symphony\\" is that it has variety and originality. It doesn't sound like anyone else, and there's plenty of memorable choruses, verses and hooks. My favorites are \\"All I Need\\" with its gospel chorus, \\"Burn It Down\\" my favorite song about arson, \\"Sail\\" with it's classical keyboard style, \\"Kill Your Heroes\\" with it's uplifting, yet somber message, \\"Shoestrings\\" with it's reminder of how family plays an important role in everyone's life, \\"People\\" with its anthemic message of hope and \\"Jump On My Shoulders\\" with its Robin Hood message to steal from the rich and give to the poor.<br /><br />Finally, there's the 12 minute \\"Knights Of Shame\\". I am not afraid of long pieces (being a fan of Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, Rush, ELP, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, etc.) \\"Knights Of Shame\\" grew on me the more I listened to the time changes, instrument changes, and tonal shifts throughout the track, it made me appreciate Aaron Bruno's musical talents. The track has a little bit of everything thrown in.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like AWOLNATION, you should hunt down Under The Influence Of Giants. Aaron Bruno also did two albums (one unreleased) with his first band Home Town Heroes back in the early 2000's.<br /><br />I give AWOLNATION four stars as its not perfect or classic, but it is, for the most part, good, worthwhile indie pop not far removed from MGMT.The track has a little bit of everything thrown in.

B004R15SIW|5.0|How did America get in the economic mess that we are in? Big Business and our Government! Watch this movie and you will  be shocked and angry. I streamed this video from Amazon. Very good quality picture and sound. Amazon allows you so many hours to view the movie. I couldn't stay awake to finish it, and the next night I only had about an hour left. Good thing I was almost at the end. A very good movie that allows everyone a chance to get an answer to the lingering question.....How exactly did we end up in this economic mess? And, who is to blame? Every single American should watch this movie and remember it while they think about their vote come election time.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Star Trek TOS. And after I read some of the reviews about this particular item, I decided on purchasing it. I was not disappointed. I love the fact that I can watch it as it was first created or the remastered edition. They're both found on the disc. I enjoyed the remastered episodes. I agree with many of the other posters that if the technology had been there when they were made, that's how Gene Rodenberry would have wanted them to look. The colors are so vibrant; it was a thrill to watch. I definately recommend this item.

B00466HN6S|3.0|(Written by the teenager in residence)    Upon first hearing of Hop, I had high hopes for it. Although the premise - holiday figure gets injured in accident, everyman has to replace him - has been done before, one detail caught my eye - \\"From the people who brought you Despicable Me\\". Despicable Me is one of my favorite modern-day animated films, with interesting (and entertaining) characters, solid plotting, and a good dose of heart. Naturally, I expected this movie to be on the same level, or at least have some solid execution. It delivered in the entertainment value, but it left a lot to be desired.      Story: 7/10 - As mentioned, the premise combines several cliches - kid has legacy, kid wants to be something else, kid runs away from home, is in danger of having his birthright or whatever stolen by some other guy if he doesn't make it back home before a certain date. It also has the standard everyman who can't hold a job, but has his life changed when he accidentally injures, maims, or even kills a holiday figure (in this case it's the former) and eventually finds his place in the world. It's been done a million times, and the fact that said holiday figure is a talking CGI animal and the humans are all in live-action draws parallels to Alvin and the Chipmunks.    Depth: 4/10 - Now, a cliched premise is not a bad thing, and some works have managed to excel despite (or because of) their uses of cliches (like BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger), although mileage varies. A bungled execution, however, is certainly not good. The interactions between the human protagonist(Fred o'Hare) and the rabbit (E.B.) don't have much of an emotional impact - it's same old, same old. There are some interesting plot points that never get explored further - E.B. wants to be a drummer, rather than the Easter Bunny, but we're never really given a clear reason why (except for \\"touring the world\\", but his father (the incumbent Easter Bunny) points out that easter bunnies go all over the world,too). The Pink Berets, sent to bring E.B. back home, aren't developed, don't have a single line of dialogue, and are generally incompetent (they mistake a Butterball for a bunny by the end). And the fact that the easter bunnies live on Easter Island could have been used for some interesting, if far-fetched, plot points - maybe the Moai are actually sentient guardians of the factory where the Easter Bunnies make their candy? But no - all of these plots are wasted.    Characters: 5/10 - Most of these characters are underdeveloped and underused throughout the movie. For example, Fred fits squarely into the archetype of \\"beleagured slacker with a good heart\\", and doesn't show much depth except for his desire to be the Easter Bunny. To his credit, he does show that he's willing to work for his goals, but that's really it. The main villain, Carlos, is an obvious bad guy with cliched motives, but he is the most sympathetic character - considering how big of a jerk the Easter Bunny is when Carlos tries to show that he can be competent, it's easy to understand why he's so ticked off. The sad thing, though, is that we never see that Carlos could be a good easter bunny - indeed, when he takes over, he almost ruins the holiday experience for non-birds. All of the human characters except for Fred and David Hasselhoff (don't ask) are underutilized as well - his older sister, Sam, is used to give him a job interview that E.B. fumbles for him and a lecture on responsibility, but doesn't really do anything else. His younger sister, Alex, acts like a jerk and hassles Fred during a family dinner, but ends up upstaged and humiliated by a \\"ventriloquism\\" act that comes across as disproportionate karma. The whole scene doesn't have that much of an impact on the main plot, either, except for straining Fred's realtionship with his family even further. And don't get me started on the Pink Berets - seriously, don't.     Entertainment: 8/10 - Despite these glaring flaws, Hop proves to be entertaining on the first go-through regardless. It's only when examined with a keen eye that the fridge logic sets in. The jokes are relatively funny, the animation is fluid and avoids uncanny valley, and the soundtrack is decent, although not magnificent. The MST3K mantra - \\"It's only a movie, I should really relax\\" - applies in full here, but it still manages to be a nice diversion overall.     Overall: 24/40 - Like I said, there are many flaws and cliches used in this movie. There are a lot of wasted plots and potential characterization gone down the drain, but it still manages to be a nice experience on the first go-through. My recommendation would be to see it once, laugh a lot, and don't think too much about it. For the kiddies, take them to see \\"Rango\\" - a vastly superior animated experience - or watch \\"Despicable Me\\" again before you go see this. It's a good time on the first go-through, but overall, it's just... meh.
0143035711|5.0|This is classic, a great book.  If you think you'd like to read a book about VN that's also about helicopter flying, you will love it.    The one problem with this book has always been that it lacked the photos Mason talks about having taken in VN.  It still does (too expensive to print?) but at least now they're available on heck Mason's site, robertmason dot com.
0307887960|5.0|Fantastic!  Easy to understand the process.  Have lost 16 lbs. and inches in 5 weeks (and I only eat fish).  Have recommended to three other friends.  Much healthier than Atkins.  I have plenty of energy and love that I can eat when hungry without measuring.  The oat bran pancake is delicious and is a great appetite killer.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|This album sounds wonderful from far away with the volume turned down low, but actually trying to listen to it is painfully difficult.  I'm a big fan of trying to recreate a \\"vintage\\" sound, which suits the Fleet Foxes well, however, I think the sound engineers have grossly overdone it for the album \\"Helplessness Blues.\\"  The reverb in particular, which is mainly applied to the vocals, is much too intrusive and greatly drowns out the other sounds.  I have a strong feeling that there are many wonderful musical moments within the tracks on this CD, but I find it nearly impossible to pick them out under the muddied vocal reverb.    On my living room system I felt the urge to turn the volume up higher than normal to try to pick out the lyrics of the song, but of course everything else became louder too which further drowned out what I wanted to hear.  All the lower frequencies tumble into a muddy droning soup which my subwoofer belched out to further confuse my ears.  I turned the subwoofer down in an effort to avert some of the lower frequencies which helped a little, but I don't need to do that with any of my other CDs, so why should I need to do that with this one?    Trying not to lose hope I decided to put on my headphones (reference quality).  Headphone listening was OK on some tracks, such as \\"Blue Spotted Tail\\" which doesn't have too much going on, but on most songs it just felt like I was sitting at a concert with  my head in a bucket.    Despite all the harsh feelings I have about the sound mix of this album, I still found myself wanting to give it 3 stars.  The music itself is good and I like the Fleet Fox style.  I just wish the sound itself was something I could enjoy as much as the music.  I have a feeling it will sound better in situations where I'm not likely to want to focus on it too much, such as while driving or while doing work around the house.  Maybe I just need to get some low-fi vintage stereo equipment, or would that make it even worse?
1604680547|5.0|This book was certainly a surprise,  when I ordered the book I was expecting motifs not much else but motifs that I could use for my quilting journey.  When my order came through it was a delight for inside were the motifs that I had expected but there was also on each page of each motif were diagrams of how to use each motif as is, or in borders, on corners, to make four sided blocks, and many other ideas, it is good to see how they come together when you may be having a senior moment .  Now my biggest decision is where to start
B000FCKGPC|2.0|When I read the first book, A Game of Thrones, I was enthralled. By the time I got to this book, I was bored. Whichever critic who called Martin the \\"American Tolkien\\" should have his head examined. Honestly, this barely counts as fantasy and Westeros and it's surrounding climes can barely touch Middle-Earth. The story is too cyclical, with the same events happening again and again. Most of the characters I liked get killed off, or are constantly getting captured and re-captured. In the fourth book we never get back to the Wall, which seems to be a keypoint of the series, and never hear of Brandon and Rickon. I wish Catelyn, who actually should have stayed dead due to her foolish decisions, and that Cersi would finally get killed, since she's really become a boring character. Jamie, who I started out really hating, I've started to like, but where was Tyrion? It seems that after the second book, Martin just threw a bunch of ideas in the air and then put them in any order he liked. Too many important parts happen off stage; Robb's wounding, his romance with Jeyne (can anyone in this series keep a lid on their libido? Sex, sex and more sex gets dull after a while.) I miss the Direwolves most of all. And what's with all killing and violence toward Dog's in this series? Can any happy events happen? Is Martin clinically depressed? The books after A Game of Thrones never live up to the promise of that book, and while I will read the fifth, filling the coffers of the publisher a bit more, I likely will never re-read them, unlike say, The Lord of the Rings, The Alvin Maker series, or the Once and Future King, which are great, top-notch fantasies.
B004R63MWQ|2.0|I loved seeing Jeff Bridges and Bruce, but this was long and boring. And why one of the characters was suppose to be so important was never fully explained. Nice setup, but then it just died.
B001LM1456|2.0|Love Norton and Tyler, although this movie didn't give them much to work. I am surprised this averaged 4 stars.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I think that for lack of a script that was suitable for the power and visual control that Zack Snyder wanted for his next motion picture, he \\"had to create\\" this story as an excuse to raise the film industry to a visual level never before achieved.  It is hard to imagine someone with the mastery of camera, colors, lighting and cinematography that Zack Snyder have, so buy it and enjoy it in a relaxed way, because it is the work of a genius ahead of his time... and script writers...  Plus, my girlfriend loves this movie and I love Emily Browning!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|AMAZING!  Why had I not heard of these guys before?  Each song has a similar quality yet owns its own story.  I had heard Rolling Away Your Stone while in the car and it blew me away...the banjo and base are amazing.  Winter Winds another beautiful song...banjo with a touch of mariachi trumpet...who does that???  Mumford and Sons thats who.  And they do it so well!  The lyrics are amazing as well...true poetry...true verse...take this line from Sigh No More:     \\"Love it will not betray you, dismay or enslave you,  It will set you free\\"    I would very much suggest picking up this whole album...you will not be displeased...just give the songs a few chances to tickle your ear and fancy your heart.    Thanks Mumford and Sons for appearing out of nowhere when I was in need of something new.  I am a fan of Coldplay and Blue October...I'm pretty sure Mumford and Sons has in a matter of 24 hours become my third alltime favorite band!    All I can say is:  Get it!

B003539QKO|4.0|I think he should just play the music he wants to play and enjoy artist freedom of more than one project. Honestly, the man is sick that's why he's on the street so much and I personally think he's trying to Go Vegan, something all Americans might want to consider also because of a polluted eco-system making it even harder to live a full life.
B003UESJH4|5.0|ENJOYED THE MOVIE; ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED THE PROMPT DELIVERY SERVICE ON THIS FILM; I WAS NO. 99 ON THE LIST AT THE LIBRARY AND THOUGHT THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY...THERE WAS  AMAZON.COM.  B. WHATLEY
B001OQCV6A|2.0|With two excellent actors (well, one and a half), a villain straight from the nether realms, and a sexy female complete with pouty lips and a total inability to locate her bullets when she really needs them (typical American), you'd think this movie would have been better. But, as things stood, it was merely mediocre verging on boring.<br /><br />The problem (one of them) was that the plot was sheer nonsense.  The evil villain, Lord Blackwood, has a plan to take over the world and create an empire! Mwahahahaha ...<br /><br />Did anybody notice that Great Britain already HAD taken over the world? Did the phrase \\"The sun never sets on the British Empire\\" ring a bell? Hello? Anyone?<br /><br />Aside from that minor point, the rest of the movie was pretty much dull as dishwater.  Lots of pointless fast action fight scenes, dialogue that was mostly mumbled (thank god), and some silly stuff beween Holmes and Watson (or House and Wilson, if you prefer) that was supposed to be funny, but really wasn't.<br /><br />This movie could not have been further from the original Sherlock Holmes if Guy Ritchie had tried. (And it's pretty obvious that he didn't.)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|If it weren't for \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" being highlighted on Glee, I'd never have discovered Adele, and what a treasure I'd be missing. Absolutely fantastic vocals, full of soul and heart. Thanks Glee!
B00005JLEU|5.0|What an amazing imagination this man has! He is my hero! This film makes you want to go into chihiro's world, I wish that such a world existed lol. I saw Princess Monoke with my boyfriend and he loved it but I didn't understand it. Love Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky! His imagination just amazes me. Really hope he lives a long life and makes more movies!
B00007KWHP|5.0|With The Yes Album behind and Close to the Edge ahead, Fragile lies between two tall musical peaks. Recorded at the end of 1971 with Rick Wakeman as a newcomer, this is an album which surpassed anyone's expectations - something big came together when Yes entered the studio to record it.     Fragile mixed individual ideas - five songs, one for each member with four full blown group contributions, something which lent a distinctive flavour to it and ultimately gave more power to their creative differences. This is also the absolute peak of Jon Anderson's voice in my opinion while Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Bill Bruford are all at the top of their creativity and sound truly inspired all through the record with Rick Wakeman's colourful ideas as the icing of the cake. Everything blends into a highly inventive and most unique experience which was surely unheard of at the time of its release. 1971 was a most unbelievable year in music when defining albums such as this, Led Zeppelin IV and Jethro Tull's Aqualung - among many others - were recorded.    Although Yes would still fly high for the next few years, with Tales From Topographic Oceans being one of my all-time favourites, this is where they reached this musical brilliance and complexity for the first time. Songs such as Roundabout, South Side Of The Sky, Long Distance Runaround and Heart Of The Sunrise are all classic Yes without a doubt, and would stand out on any album by anyone for that matter.       As for the Rhino remastered 2003 reissue, I can only say that this was/is the release you'd been waiting for. Great sound allied to great packaging can only bring great results and that's exactly what you get here.
B002UJIY70|3.0|ok, so it's not the BEST movie and until a friend recomended it i never even heard of it. my friend is infatuated with Timmothy Olyphant. it was a lttle on the predictable side and way to formulaic for me. the acting is not great, the script leaves a lot to be desired. there are just better Olyphant titles out there that are better....such as Justified
B004QPOVG4|4.0|I was there, on Bs. As. and went to the concert. Unforgettable, amazing fun. I was hoping for these DVD to come out, and was everything I was looking for. Incredible.

B004QITJC2|5.0|\\"Human Remains\\" is the brand new, debut album by British heavy metal band \\"Hell\\". \\"Hell\\", originally part of the NWOBHM movement of the early 80s, were active from 1982 to 1986; at which point they had become an established live act and recorded demos on numerous occasions, still their inability to establish a record deal, combined with the death of their frontman David Halliday (vocals, guitar) disbanded \\"Hell\\". 25 years later, original members bassist Tony Speakman, drummer Tim Bowler and guitarist Kev Bower reunite, joined by lead singer David Bower and guitarist Andy Sneap. Andy Sneap, the highly acclaimed metal producer is actually responsible for the reformation of \\"Hell\\" being the force backing this line up and new album (having produced it as well as performing on it).<br /><br />\\"Human remains\\" features brand new versions of strictly classic material, a total of 11 tracks all of which were written and demoed back in the day. Still as one would expect the album features state of the art production, breathing new life into the material. In terms of musical direction, the sound of Hell draws considerably on the sound of early \\"Accept\\",  and \\"Judas Priest\\" yet the vocals are the main point of differentiation being somewhat theatrical and sarcastic, while remaining consistently clean.<br /><br />There is not much sense into talking about favourite songs, as the album is a classic at its own right. For fans of NWOBHM, traditional heavy metal or power metal, \\"Hell-Human Remains\\" will definitely prove an intriguing experience. (The limited edition of the album is a double digipack/booklet featuring the album plus a second CD with the original demos mentioned above).<br /><br />\\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 317) marks this album with 9/10 commenting: \\"I know I will be playing this album forever amongst my favourites.\\"
0756404738|1.0|Talk about a sophomore slump.  I was really looking forward to WMF after reading and rereading TNOTW.  This book was awful, I don't really care how Kvothe came to be such a great lover.  Really, sex with a fairy, then more sex with a ninja teacher?  I assume Rothfuss is trying to make some statement about our societies view on sex, and that we're a bunch of barbarians until we become \\"enlightened\\" enough to go around doing it with everyone?  Maybe not, just felt like it.  I'm also going to assume Tempi and all the others were wiped out by STD's at some point in the future.<br /><br />Even putting aside the sex thing, this book went no where.  I could barely put down TNOTW, I could barely pick up WMF.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This story was so refreshing it is totally different from all the other PNR books out there. I must confess that I absolutely L-O-V-E books about dragon shifters. Dragos is a \\"bad ass\\" dragon and he is super sexy. I like that he is not easy or adorable for everybody as-a-matter-of-fact everybody else is afraid of him! Pia is a great heroine she is funny and and strong. A \\"girly-girl\\". The supportive characters are likeable too. In this book you have a world with a dragon, elves, goblins, a thunderbird, and so much more that have not ben introduced yet. Now I did get a little cross-eyed when Dragos and Pia started talking about \\"Other Land\\" it was just a little too scientifc for me. But don't worry it is only a paragraph or so long.<br />My little review doesn't do any justice for this book. All I have to say is read it and you will not be disappointed. I look forward to the next book in this series.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes: \\"Back-up girly girl\\", \\"I see the lunatic inhabiting your body is alive and well\\", and...\\"Let me make this perfectly clear. Just so there's no mistake. You all have come to mean a lot to me. She is mine and I'm keeping her. If a single hair on that young woman's head is harmed you four bastards better be slaughtered and in pieces when I find you.\\" Love you Dragos!!!
1400063736|5.0|Words exist to communicate.  They carry an idea from one brain to another.  Sometimes they are not very good at their job.  For example, sometimes we are left guessing just exactly what someone meant when they said, \\"We all know what the problem is here.\\"     But other times words are incredibly efficient--for example, when someone yells \\"Fire!\\" and everyone runs out of the building.  In this particular instance, that one word carries a lot of information.  It manages to say, \\"To all of you who can hear me right now, there is a fire in this structure.  It is a dangerous thing.  If you can hear me you should get out of this structure as quickly as you can.  You should also tell others of this danger.\\"  As a ratio of meaning to words, \\"Fire!\\" packs quite a wallop.     On the train on the way to Philadelphia today I finished reading Colum McCann's kick-in-the-stomach collection of interconnected short stories called Let the Great World Spin.  It got me thinking about words and their efficiency.  Edgar Allen Poe had a theory about short stories.  He believed that a short story should be about one precise feeling or effect and every word in the story should contribute to that effect.  Even the most lyrical and beautiful of sentences should be cut if it got in the way of the feeling the author hoped to create in the reader's soul.     Somehow, in his 349-page collection of eleven stories centered on the true-life walk of Philippe Petit from one of the World Trade Center towers to the other on an August morning in 1974, Colum McCann manages the literary equivalent of yelling \\"Fire!\\" Taken as a whole, the stories of the twelve characters in Let the Great World Spin manage to convey the full range of what it means to be a thinking, feeling human in the world.  This book is miraculous.     It is one of the most efficient books I have ever read.  The meaning-to-word ratio is huge.  Some of my favorite sentences are below:      \\"No shame in saying that I felt a loneliness drifting through me.  Funny how it was, everyone perched in their own little world, with the deep need to talk,  each person with their own tale, beginning in some strange middle point, then trying so hard to tell it all, to have it all make sense, logical and final.\\"    \\"I guess this is what marriage is, or was, or could be.  You drop the mask. You allow the fatigue in.  You lean across and kiss the years because they're the things that matter.\\"    \\"She likes the people with the endurance to tolerate the drudge, the ones who know that pain is a requirement, not a curse.\\"    \\"The only thing worth grieving over, she said, was that sometimes there was more beauty in this life than the world could bear.\\"       And sometimes more pain.  And somehow Colum McCann has taken both--as well as everything in between--and put it to just the right words to say it all.  And more.    \\"The world spins.  We stumble on.  It is enough.\\"     [...]
B000002GB2|5.0|Styx on this one created a real masterwork. This hasn't a bad song on it and is a really solid in every regard. This one is truly a masterwork from this band it's progressive rock and yet it's more accessible than most prog rock in it's tight layered singing and playing.  This version of styx is far from the good pop rock band they would become but that version was a good version too imo but this is like a rock masterpiece. (so is the grand illusion' imo).<br />I just saw this band in colorado springs in 2011 and they still play 'lorelie' as good as back in this era! Which says alot about how good this cd really is.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|I bought this movie on a recommendation from a friend. It delivered in the entertainment department! Also, Kuriyama Chiaki and Shibasaki Kou are in it and I love them!  The movie itself has a few weird points but I took it for what it was and enjoyed. The violence is brutal at times but there are characters you root for so that makes up for it. Good action movie that you don't have to think to hard to enjoy~
B000066C6Z|4.0|I recall, from seeing the original movie, that there were several signs and bits that were edited out of the DVD.  The entire scene where the rock star was outfitted with his tux was eliminated. Still a funny movie.

B004I11VZA|4.0|Having been a fan of the first IP Man, I was really excited for the sequel. Even though the premise of the plot is pretty much the same as it is in the first movie... IP Man 2 still delivered a wonderful backstory mixed with superb martial arts action. Even Mr. Sammo Hung had a role, whereas he was simply the action choreographer in the first (I think). This is martial arts action at it's finest. With this movie, however, there was a little bit more wire-work with Donnie Yen's action sequence (especially with Sammo Hung in the scene when they go fist-to-fist). Fortunately the wire-work is very minimal - and the rest of the movie is very, very enjoyable. I took a star simply because the sequel's plot is virtually the same as the first movie; instead of Japanese soldiers, this time Ip Man is faced with defending China's honor against the British. It's still an awesome movie for those fans of the martial arts genre.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|Another Christmas, and Hollywood has another remake of the Dickens' classic ready to go.  This time we have Jim Carrey playing Scrooge.  Though this might seem crazy at first, as Carrey is a comedian and this story is a drama, remember that Carrey carried the the live-action adaptation of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas.  And he does it again with this movie, which I think is the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  All the previous CGI-flicks directed by Robert Zemeckis has finally led to this impressive work.  The music is good, the animation is spot-on, the dialog is perfect, and the action is engaging.  The special effects are probably the movie's  highlight, but they serve the movie, allowing the film's story to be told in new ways, and do not distract from either the plot or the dialog.  And like Tom Hanks in Polar Express, Jim Carrey plays multiple characters in this movie, including the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future.  It is his acting in these scenes that show him at his best.  The movie's representation of the ghost of Christmas present was the best one I've ever seen, with an innovative way of having the ghost take Scrooge around London to show how his peers are talking about him.  Overall, probably the best Christmas movie of the year.
B000SEGTI0|1.0|DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP is a very poorly executed dystopia, and it's all due to the soullessness of PKD's writing. The mass extinction of animals, the decay of all matter into \\"kibble,\\" and the abandonment of Earth by a majority of humans to off-world colonies all underscore the bleakness of the future.<br /><br />However, the effect is lost on the reader because there is no one that warrants empathy. With the exception of the pathetic J. R. Isidore, the characters, androids and humans alike, are automatons: boring and lifeless. Conversations are completely flat and unaffected. They don't talk to each other, but rather past each other, so they hardly react to what is going on around them. Blink, and the reader will miss a startling revelation. There's no natural break to reflect, \\"Oh, my gosh, she really is an android!\\" or \\"Holy cow, their religion is a fraud!\\" What's worse, these revelations are mere unpopped kernels of philosophical insight that PKD takes no pains to explore.<br /><br />The reader is sometimes told how the characters feel, but PKD never shows us how they feel, or offers to explain why. There's no deep explanation behind Rick Deckard's moodiness; he's just moody. He buys a black Nubian goat on impulse and has sex with an android on a whim--there's no indication he even enjoyed it. He changes his mind in the middle of a conversation (\\"I won't kill her/Maybe I will\\"), but the reader has no clue where he will come out, because we have no idea what he's thinking.<br /><br />The plot is terribly straightforward but mired in wild, incongruous details, like Deckard being kidnapped by a shadow police unit that, unbeknownst to itself, is comprised entirely of androids. This would appear to be a game-changer, but Deckard forgets it ever happened. There's also the paradoxical Voigt-Kampf test: not only can Deckard not rely on it to tell androids apart from humans, but the test itself is unnecessary, as Deckard already knows the names of the androids he's looking for.<br /><br />PKD's laconic prose is as soulless as the characters. I don't mean the text is descriptive enough. I mean it presents events in a monotonous, minimalist cadence that fails to convey any sense of excitement or urgency. Whereas the final battle with Roy Baty in the movie included a 10-minute chase culminating in a poetic rooftop eulogy, the novel's climax is literally wrapped up in a single paragraph.<br /><br />The only redeeming trait is the character of J. R. Isidore, whose brain is defective due to fallout sickness. He captures a spider in his apartment building and is sickened when the androids he is helping to hide from Deckard begin dissecting it while it was still alive. This is a scene where the \\"less is more\\" writing style actually works, because we can posit our own reaction on J. R. Isidore. Too bad the rest of the novel could not have carried the same moral presence.PKD's laconic prose is as soulless as the characters. I don't mean the text is descriptive enough. I mean it presents events in a monotonous, minimalist cadence that fails to convey any sense of excitement or urgency. Whereas the final battle with Roy Baty in the movie included a 10-minute chase culminating in a poetic rooftop eulogy, the novel's climax is literally wrapped up in a single paragraph.    The only redeeming trait is the character of J. R. Isidore, whose brain is defective due to fallout sickness. He captures a spider in his apartment building and is sickened when the androids he is helping to hide from Deckard begin dissecting it while it was still alive. This is a scene where the \\"less is more\\" writing style actually works, because we can posit our own reaction on J. R. Isidore. Too bad the rest of the novel could not have carried the same moral presence.

B000UPGQQW|5.0|There is nothing like seeing some hot guys who actually know how to dress wooohooo! The rock was awesome and brought back many memories when people used to know how to have fun on the beaches of Santa Monica and Half Moon Bay. These were places where we used to go to party. So the movie brought back a lot of good times. I love the ending of this movie and got a good laugh out of it. Nicely done! Def two thumbs up from me and a fan to cool off with is needed!<br />Clarrissa Lee Moon<br />[...]

Ah ha Danny Trejo!!! Thats his name. Love the tats...and another big name guy, an old timer ...been around for a while ( just cant recall the name right now) anyways...the vampires were so cheesy. I mean really chheeesy. and no history of them, no tribe, no why are they...just a part of the back ground and dare I say again...cheesy.<br />But it was funny, too. The original parts came from watching these bad a....es kick butt..and a guy having a gun flip out from a pocket in his crotch and fire ammo. LMAO ok now the recoil action would have hammered more delicate parts in real life-- but ok...he also had this whip made of steel ... a real Indiana Jones thing --that was cool...never saw a metal one before and the kick rear scenes were good. Loved seeing George Clooney play a partial bad guy part. What was funny is how these bad a....es could whip rear while they were human but be so easy to kill when they turned vamp- OMG really? ok What was truly hilarious was seeing Cheech Marin play four different parts in this movie...it would have been ok if it was pulled off better but it really didn't fit in this type of vamp movie....it did have some original story line parts- the ending was a surprise and for once -not typical..I can deal with it...but all in all...one thumb up for some originality another thumb up for cheesiness!<br />Clarrissa Lee Moon<br />author of (...)mb up for some originality another thumb up for cheesiness!

B003OML23K|5.0|This has quickly become my ALL TIME favorite book! The entire series is incredible for young adults and older adults alike. I have listened to it twice on audiobook and now I want the original hardbacks to read and add to my collection! I have never written a book review (or any other review) in my life, but this book is so incredible and compelling, I just had to speak up. If you are reading this because you are not sure if this is for you, it is! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!

B004RC8NXI|1.0|Not even worth the one star but I couldn't figure out how to leave none. I am a fan of foulmouthed humor but humor has to be the main ingredient. I hung in for about 20 minutes and had to give up. The only scene that was even mildly amusing was Adam's wake up call in Emma's apartment. The sardonic roommates were hilarious, the moment ruined by the clumsy sex that followed. YUCK. Run away from this mess.
B003102JDM|5.0|People who try to make a movie that does not follow Hollywood plot lines can turn a typical childhood into a soap opera that never ends. Americans going through this mishmash in real life turns my stomach as much as ludicrous entertainment. I liked the movie because the mystery was so much of everything all the time.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I do very few reviews on amazon but had to get my feelings re this dvd out there. I'm 39 and never danced in my life until about a year ago when I discovered the joys of belly dance. I've practised yoga for years and had heard mention in a magazine article that the drills that belly dancers practice would be great for yoga practice, now I was sceptical I will admit but I decided to give it a go, also I seem to fit snugly into the long line of women out there who are curvy and who are made increasingly aware that 'curvy' is not acceptable for a womans body type in this media driven world(at least according to all the magazines out there!!)I discovered that belly dance drills were great for learning to isolate but I also had an amazing experience, I actually found myself loving my curves!!! and began to experience my body in a completely different way, so I continued to buy a few more dvds and also purchased Serpentine.  This dvd is spectacular and difficult and challenging but amazing and I'm so proud that I can do most of it!! and get a great work out!! So whether you have dance experience or not I suggest you buy this dvd, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!

B0015DROBO|4.0|I actually listened to this book rather than reading it since I was making a long drive.  I have to say I thought the storyline and the characters were fresh and not something I had read before.  The reason I gave it only four stars is that the reader was forced to slog through a lot of financial and legal mumbo jumbo.  Poor editing in my view.  But, I did love the story even though I wasn't thrilled with the way the relationship ended up.  I have the Girl Who Played With Fire and am looking forward to reading the next chapter of the trilogy.
0316056863|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was funny and very entertaining.  My only complaint would that it didn't give much insight as to Tina as a person.  It's more of a biography of her work and working in the industry than a biography of her personal life.  Overall, however, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.

B003GK21U8|2.0|After reading Pillars of Earth, I thought of reading other Ken Follet´s books. Based on the customer reviews i picked this one, but what a crappy book, it starts really slow, and gets interesting until you reach 20% of it. I agree with the reviewer who said there was a huge hole in the plot, but i think the worst part was the ending, how come suddenly Follet makes this lame woman the hero of the book, unbelievable. Honestly, every time I had to read events related to this woman and her family I skimmed through the whole thing. The ending sucks so much, that it ruined the whole book for me, I don´t think that I´ll be reading Follet for a while.

006201563X|5.0|Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's first published novel, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Marianne is young and flirtatious and has very set ideas about what sort of person her true love, her knight in shining armour will be. Elinor, much more restrained, mature and sensible, has quite a different attitude to life and love. Both meet the man they believe is for them, but for neither does the course of true love run smooth. This charming novel has some very likeable characters, as well as a few to despise or disdain, and plenty of muddles, misunderstandings and wrong assumptions. Altogether a delight to read: easy to understand why this is a classic.

1907590102|4.0|I have been curious about this book for a long time, both because of the Bill Murray movie and [[ASIN:0099468646 Earthly Powers]], Burgess' book featuring a fictionalized version of Maugham as well as an ending featuring a destructive cult that may be a rumination on the spirituality of Larry. Finding out that the Larry character is based on Christopher Isherwood makes it all the more interesting (although Isherwood's dabbling with Eastern mysticism didn't make him asexual and his later years were lived in blissful cohabitation with a man 30 years younger).     So I was a little startled to discover that Larry is not the main character of the book. Larry is merely a template for Maugham to meditate on his view of America which is a country that Maugham sees as capable of embracing everything with an enthusiasm - whether it's materialism or spirituality. Larry is the spiritualist side of the American spirit with his wanderings in every conceivable occupation including coal miner and Hindu mystic but his former fiancee represents the materialism that will always be chasing after the spiritual and having it elude him. In between is Sophia, the woman that Larry gets engaged to as a means of saving her soul even as Isabel connives to destroy her. She works as a creature of excess who has potential for grace or self-destruction.    I was not prepared for the Maugham filter in which everything the main character (Larry) does is filtered through the lens of Maugham (writing as a character in the story) who is world weary and cynical and therefore taken with Larry's mystical air of a man cut off from the world and seeking meaning beyond the vulgar materialism. As far as Maugham's narrative is concerned, Larry's wandering and wondering is as foregin to his sensibilities as the \\"money money money\\" attitudes of the rest of the characters. The only one that Maugham really feels a kinship with is Elliot the snob who is self-consciously being a snob to compensate for not being oneof the idle rich. What's even more interesting is the way that Maugham can see that Larry's rejected fiancee (she wants him to be normal but WWI changed him) Isabel is a vicious woman without scruple - and finds it obvious that she left an open bottle of alcohol for the tragic Sophie to indulge in when she was attempting to stay sober. Maugham doesn't judge her because he understands her, but he also knows that Larry wouldn't be able to notice her sins.     I was hoping for more about post-WWI veterans and the lost generation, but this is not a lost generation novel. It is a work of fiction entrenched in the drawing rooms of the pre-war era and seeking something for more.
0061122416|4.0|The story was real engaging, I enjoyed the writing and it was a real quick read. Not sure the Personal Legend concept itself is as good as the writing and story, so that's why 4 stars instead of 5.
B000E41MRC|5.0|Propaganda. Today's movies, newspapers, TV shows, books, can be considered propaganda for propaganda is a general term.      Given that said, \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is a historical documentary of events as it happens, no re-enactments. Non fiction and \\"Filmed on location\\".    A few historical facts.    1. Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP was just a political party with Nationalist Socialist goals. A legally elected party of a population of 70 million or so. Think Democrats or Republicans.    2. Germany had 6 years of peace, ignoring the propaganda war by the USA/others, from 1933 thru 1939. Economic programs initiated by Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP created jobs and the Autobahn. Germany before 1945, under Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP, had their own Germanic culture, economics (Nationalizing of companies and such), and banking system - zero interest loans for starters.    3. Poland.  A nation of 20 years created by the USA imposed \\"Treaty of Versailles\\". Poland was originally Germany for 200 years. Poland had two military dictators. The first dictator was OK with Adolf Hitler, non aggression pacts and agreements. The first one died and the second Polish military dictator was a menace. After all, the newly created nation of Poland had a blank check guarantee from England and France. Adolf Hitler was forced to take action against half of Poland. Poland was threatening Germany.  Russia invaded the other half two weeks later. Bottom line, the \\"invasion\\" of Poland was a REGIONAL conflict. Not worth a world war.    4. Adolf Hitler was trying to save a nation called the German Empire united in 1871. WW1 and the Treaty of Versailles took advantage of a weak Germany. Germany was forced to accept territorial concessions - Poland and Czechoslovakia, 70 year fines, and military occupation. Much more than just the \\"War Guilt Clause\\". The \\"Treaty of Versailles\\" was all about control and redefining an independent European nation called the German Empire. In reality, Germany was fighting a 30year war - 1914 thru 1945. Adolf Hitler was elected Reichspresident in 1933.    5. Adolf Hitler, the NSDAP, and Germany before 1945 were the good guys. American GI's and the public were tricked into war with Germany. The anti German propaganda was downright silly at the time. And today.    6. One must break free from culturally ingrained 70 years worth of propaganda. I have.     7. Finally, I enjoy watching \\"Triumph of the Will\\". I see nothing wrong with it. A small tidbit of much larger historical puzzle.
B000RJO578|5.0|This is probably one of my top five favorite movies. It's so perfect. The script perfectly mirrors Action Movies and presents a boring English Town in as exciting a way as it can. The ridiculous twists of the script, the fantastically over the top performances that keep it just this side of straight parody and enter into a sort of reverence, this is a great comedy simply because it doesn't treat itself as one. It's a movie that happens to be a bit gory and happens to have a few explosions in it, and happens to have some guys who are REALLY good at throwing knives, but that's all just incidental to the fact that the Goose has escaped and needs to be put back ASAP.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|The color animation was spectacular. A movie that should be seen in 3-D. The plot and dialouge are slightly less than colorful. It Is not one of those movies designed to keep parents overly entertained. There are a few things kids won't get, like the Carmen Miranda hat on the bull dog. The movie is about poachers, breeding almost extinct birds, and the question of animal captivity. Blu, the last blue Macaw is happy in captivity and can't fly. Jewel, his would-be mate, hates captivity and loves to fly. Animated girls in bikinis, booty shaking, and Anne Hathaway as the naked Jewel bird (She just can't keep her clothes on anymore, even in an animated film.)<br /><br />My 9 year old grand niece loves this movie and has seen it about 3 times.

1594202842|3.0|This book is interesting and a good read. This woman made an excellent memoir. BUT... I completely disagree with her racist us against them mentality. This is not the Chinese way to raise your kids. The Chinese do not raise their kids like this. Complete psychopaths do. Trying to show your kids you love them by humiliating and berating them has nothing to do with \\"chinese\\" and everything to do with OCD. No the C is not for chinese. I agree with trying to instill a work ethic and drive into your children but not with holding love and encouragement. Shame on you. Calling this \\"Chinese\\" is akin to calling the Branch Davidians cult \\"The American way\\"

1400031001|4.0|I found this book both fascinating and frustrating. Fascinating, as the life Mountstuart leads is exciting and unpredictable, yet frustrating as one cannot understand the motivation that lies behind the seemingly random events of the protagonist's life. This was an enjoyable read, though for completely different reasons than usual. Typically, I love to read about the inner workings and motivations that lie behind the actions of the main character, yet here the reader is left somewhat bereft.     I loved the simplicity with which Mountstuart views life, as a series of events that happen to him out of chance; yet at times I wanted to strangle him for lacking the ability to learn from past mistakes and never having the foresight to plot any sort of future for himself.     This was a fun break from the norm. Mogadishu.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 1 Blu-ray Review    Distributor: Anchor Bay Entertainment (US)    Some of us have been waiting patiently for a full blown zombie television series for what seems like an eternity and finally after many years of rumours and speculation we finally get Frank Darabont's The Walking Dead.    So, would the wait eventually prove to be worthwhile? Actually, it probably was.    The series begins with the story of a police officer shot during his regular day to day activities, only to awake in hospital some weeks later to find that in the meantime the world he knew has simply gone to Hell, quite literally. The story progresses across 6 episodes and deals with a handful of survivors battling hordes of the undead whilst trying to find a safe haven and avoid becoming the next zombie meal. With a fair amount of character background which builds across the various relationships, the struggle for survival brings a decent amount of tension to the screen with characters that you will actually care for and a couple of reasonably well placed twists along the way to keep you guessing. The gore factor is also pretty high for a television series and the effects look altogether excellent throughout.    Worth noting in fact, is that the gore looked so realistic, that in all countries other than the original US broadcasts, edits have been applied to a couple of the episodes during their major gore scenes. This also remains true of the Blu-ray releases as every other version apart from this US disc contains the cut print, so if you want to see the full version of the episodes, you will be needing this US release from Anchor Bay. The only problem there being is that this disc is unfortunately locked to region A. More proof if any was required, that a region free Blu-ray player is the only way to go.     Anchor Bay have released The Walking Dead with an excellent 1080p 1.78:1 wide-screen transfer which looks fantastic. Detail is superb with colours and black levels enriching the performance. Having watched the original broadcasts, the Blu-ray looks to be on a different level and really immerses you into the story. With no print damage on display and enough grain to enhance the atmosphere and still give that home made quality, this really is the ultimate way to view the series.    Audio is also excellent. Presented with a True HD 5.1 soundtrack there is plenty here to grab your attention. From the moaning hordes of re-animated corpses to the bullet ridden showdowns, the audio drags you kicking and screaming into the action. Dialogue is clean and crisp, explosions are bassy and powerful and combined with the already classic music score, an altogether brilliant performance is delivered throughout.    Extras are also of an excellent quality, including The Making of The Walking Dead which provides a 30 minute documentary delving into various behind-the-scenes features and interviews with the cast and crew. Following this there are six mini featurettes which each focus on one particular episode in turn, behind the scenes make up tests, a producers Q&A session with a Comic-Con setting and a couple of zombie specific supplements. Rounding all of this off, there are also a couple of cast interviews and an on camera tour of one of the shows sets.    All things considered, this set is a must have for zombie fans everywhere and although some parts of the series share more than a passing similarity to films like 28 days later and modern day zombie remakes such as the Dawn of the Dead, the story here is both fun filled and gripping with more than enough new concepts to please all but the most demanding horror fan. With Season 2 beginning later this year, there is no better time to revisit the first season again, especially in its new enhanced presentation.      \\"WHAT MAKES US HUMAN?\\"      BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for those less mainstream Blu-ray reviews - find us in Facebook
B004GYY714|5.0|I installed this TuneIn Radio app on my rooted Nook Color today, and am very happy with it. To test it out, I went to Talk Radio and clicked on CBS 880 AM, which I used to listen to for news when I lived in New York. I can get it on my car radio, but it is filled with static. Well, it comes in loud and clear on my Nook Color.    I also installed the Volume+ app on my Nook, and now I can crank up the volume about double of what the Nook was capable before. Previously, I could hardly hear the Nook's speaker unless I was in a silent room.    I highly recommend the TuneIn Radio app.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I've used the VideoMic Pro (stereo) for a few shoots.   I attached it to a Panasonic HD-TM900K High-Def camcorder operated in 2D mode with no lens attachments.  First impressions:    Upside  1. Gives the videographer much more creative control over the audio portion of the shoot.  Compared to the on-board 5.1 mike array (including when it is set for front-stereo pick up only via the camcorder), the VideoMic rolls off to-the-side audio (e.g., comments by the camcorder operator or from a noisy background) much more effectively so the subject's sounds are recorded crisply.  2. The gain/level control adjustments (-10dB, flat, + 20dB) coupled with the camcorder's on-screen audio volume meter or using the real-time audio output and earphones greatly help with balancing far away and near-field subject audio so you can record more precisely.  3. The rubber shock and isolation mounts effectively remove extraneous camcorder sounds (by the way, this camcorder doesn't have appreciable fan noise, contrary to a few negative comments about it).  4. It's compact and doesn't enter into the field of view of the camcorder even in its widest angle mode.    Downside  1. The camera's special audio functions, such as changing the angle of response proportional to zoom, won't work with the external mike, but the manual level settings help with this.  2. One more thing to stuff into the camera bag, but just get a bigger bag.  3. No case for the device, so get a ziploc bag to prevent damage or loss of the rubber bands during transport.    I haven't tried the high-pass/low-cut filter for suppression of noise from fast wind, but using just the supplied foam wind shield (not a dead cat), preliminary tests with < 10 mph wind shows effectiveness.     Overall, this improves my confidence in the audio quality of the shoot.

0670022411|5.0|I originally listened to this on a CD borrowed from the library in my car. The storyline was so engaging that I sat in my car listened to it even when I needed to go inside!! I loved it so much that I promptly bought the book so I can read it again (and not in the car!)! And I rarely read/listen/watch books and movies twice, so that's a testament to how much I enjoyed it. On CD, the person talking spoke with accents which added to the story and when I read it I will hear those voices in my head. I have a great interest in old books/manuscripts, calligraphy/fonts, and old architecture. I was enthralled with the descriptions of these things in the book! I could say more but I don't want to give too much away. Suffice it to say, I found this book enticing, long enough (so many are too short for me), and I am eagerly awaiting the subsequent two books.

As a writer, I marveled at the way she drew the reader in, made you believe that the story was true, and even included a CD of songs that by the end of the book, I believed was Zoe's voice.  Very clever idea. I loved it.    The second half of the book moved more slowly than the first.  I got a bit bored during the court scenes.  Perhaps they went on too long.  But I'd still recommend the book highly.  Overall, it was a great read.
B0000025T6|5.0|I did some sound research about this album before purchasing it. I've always been a \\"casual\\" Boss fan, and have enjoyed his mainstream hits, such as Born to Run, Dancing in the Dark, Streets of Philadelphia, etc. But it was this release that people were saying was so different from the rest of his work. I read many reviews, and people talked about darkness to the music, lyrics, the album cover, and the overall simplicity of his approach (with just an acoustic guitar and harmonica). I'm pleased to say that the reviewers (Rolling Stone included) are right. This album has taken some time to grow on me, but is deserving of 5 stars. This album loosely tells a story about struggles in life (a Boss trademark), while meshing it with dark music and a feeling of despair and depression. I love the black and white album cover, as it depicts a long endless road with no one around, or no one to help. It's Nebraska, and the clouds have taken over, and it's gonna rain. It's almost insult to injury; this album sets the mood early, and triggers the imagination. I like the title track, as well as Atlantic City, Mansion on the Hill, State Trooper, and Open All Night. I will say that you need to be in the right mood (and frame of mind, for that matter) to listen to it in its entirety; it's best to play it in the car as you're driving to the pond to go fishing, or if you plan to travel a great distance. This is a folk album with a lot of emotion. Get it, and hear another side of THE BOSS.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|This is probably the best movie I have seen yet in Blu-Ray 3D. The 3D really pops out at you. The movie itself is such a wonderful, funny, animated movie. Despicable Me is great for kids and adults of all ages. I really like to bonus features on this Blu-Ray. My favorite is when they explore 3D by popping out of the screen at you. My daughter loves it and tries to grab them! So funny! If you have a 3D TV don't miss this movie!
B001VZY4MS|5.0|Neil Young's first offering, simply titled, \\"Neil Young\\" is a nice opening act to his solo career. Released the same year as his departure from Buffalo Springfield, it lays the foundation for subsequent releases in the genre of folk rock, such as Harvest, After the Gold Rush, etc. I really like THE LONER, THE EMPEROR OF WYOMING (though instrumental), THE OLD LAUGHING LADY (has a nice fade-in), HERE WE ARE IN THE YEARS, and THE LAST TRIP TO TULSA. In addition to these songs, there are a number of wonderful 2-minute+ songs that are catchy, such as IF I COULD HAVE HER TONIGHT, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY LIFE?, and I'VE LOVED HER SO LONG. The latter is my favorite among the shorter songs just mentioned. This is a strong effort by a great talent, and one of my favorite artists of all time. We all know what happened with the next album, and the rise to superstardom that followed; it's all owed to this pivotal release from 1968. This is one of my favorite Neil Young albums. Great melodies abound with this one. 9/10
014241543X|4.0|This beautifully written story begins with Mia, her parents, and her younger brother eating breakfast and deciding how they should spend their snow day. The next thing Mia knows, she is looking at her parents dead bodies and watching her own body be put into an ambulance. The next 24 hours Mia spends in the ICU as an invisible observer deciding if she should stay and live her life without the love and support of her Mom, Dad and brother, or give up and face the unknown. Mia has to make the ultimate choice and she doesn't take this decision lightly.    I knew going into this book that it was probably going to be one of the saddest books I've ever read and I wasn't wrong. Within the first few pages I was already crying. At the same time, If I Stay was so beautiful and hopeful that it made me want to read more. I can't explain why, but this story is so powerful. Adding to the story are the flashbacks Mia tells the reader about her awesome and supportive parents, her best friend, and her adoring and loving boyfriend, Adam. Forman gives every character in this book a voice and personality, even the ones who died in the first few pages.    Reading Mia decide what she should do was unbelievably sad and heartbreaking.  The ending had me hysterical and I loved every minute of it. Despite the sadness, this book really is something. It's thoughtful, sweet and wonderful. I highly recommend reading it.
B004LUHQ1G|3.0|Nothing special. I only liked two songs at first listen, most of the songs sounded like all the rest of Foo Fighters' stuff. I guess I was just expecting something more revolutionized.
0525422943|5.0|I finished Where She Went within a day and I honestly don't think anything I say or write will give this beautiful story justice. Where She Went was fantastically written and I really want to give Gayle Forman a big hug for writing it! If you haven't read If I Stay, I strongly suggest you do, if only to be able to read Where She Went.    Where She Went begins three years after the events in If I Stay. Adam and Mia are no longer together, and Adam is a big time rock star. He is also depressed, lonely, and angry. He is definitely not the same Adam we all fell in love with. Told in the present tense, as well as flashbacks, we see the events that led Adam to the point he is now. Also, at the beginning of every other chapter, we get snippets of Adam's lyrics. They were also beautiful and touching! You can really feel Adam's anger in the lyrics. I wish Shooting Star was a real band, I would totally buy their CD!    Adam, alone and walking around NYC sees Mia again and they end up spending the night walking around the city together. Through flashbacks we see her family again, and we learn just how much the tragedy changed him. I really thought Adam and Mia were going to stay together after the accident. As much as I hoped they would, after reading Where She Went I understand the reasons they didn't. I also feel the way that Mia did deal with the tragedy was very realistic.    Forman has an excellent way with her words, and the reader can feel everything that the characters can. That is why I love these books! She made Adam so raw, that my heart was breaking for him throughout the entire novel. As with If I Stay, I was crying at the end of Where She Went. The ending was so perfect! As soon as I finished it, I wanted to read it again! Just writing this review makes me want to read it again!

0802798225|5.0|Perfect Chemistry is an excellent book. I thought it was just going to be a cute, simple love story about two people from completely different backgrounds, but it was so much more than that! The story, told through a dual-narration, is about Brittany Ellis, the stereotypical popular, blond, rich, cheerleader and Alex Fuentes, the Spanish gang member from the wrong side of the tracks. Brittany hides her family secrets with her perfect appearance, and Alex, who plays the part of the bad boy thug, is really a smart, caring person who is just trying to protect his family, and little brothers from gang life. I loved knowing both Brittany's and Alex's POV, because I love when the author goes beneath the surface of a character so the reader can find out who they really are. What I also really liked about Alex is he is so much more than a gang member, he's loyal, and confident, and unlike many other gang members we see in movies, or read about in books, he knows what he is doing is wrong, and refuses to do certain things, such as dealing drugs. Alex struggles every day with his choices and doesn't see a way out, until he meets Brittany.    I just really loved this book. As soon as I finished, I was ready to read it again. Right now I am reading, Rules of Attraction, which is about Alex's little brother, Carlos, and I am loving is so far. Simone Elkeles just has a way with words that is absolutely perfect!
1582406723|5.0|This series is surprisingly well done for its genre. It delves deeply into the lives of characters rather than focusing on the gore factor, making it something you definitely can't skim, or you can expect to miss out on many important plot points. The story revolves around relationships in this book, and without the lifelike characters this series would be collecting dust on an old shelf.     That said, there is a significant amount of violence, gore, and language, making it a bad idea for kids, and maybe even young teens. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a weak stomach, although I can't stress enough that it is one of the most impressive graphic novels of all time. Definitely read this if you have not already.    Altogether, these books provide hours of entertainment, tears, jumps, and smiles. You can expect to be moved by this series, and very impressed. Definitely try out this amazing series, if not for the plot, than at least for the beautiful graphics and lively characters.
B004TE6F66|5.0|I read Shiver, the first book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series, a few weeks ago and I was taken back by this beautifully written story. I loved it! I could not stop thinking about the characters and how much I connected to them. I was afraid to read Linger, because many times, the second book does not even come close to how good the first one is! This was clearly not the case with Linger, and it exceed all of my expectations. Linger is about Sam, a boy who was once a wolf, and Grace, the girl he has loved since he saved her from the wolves when they were both children. As their relationship progresses, Sam is dealing with the trauma in his past, and Grace is dealing with her parents, and trying to figure out why she is so sick all of a sudden. In Shiver, the book is told through Sam and Grace's points of view (POV). In Linger, Sam and Grace are still prominent characters, but Stiefvater adds two additional POV. One is Cole, a singer in a very popular band who decided to become a wolf to escape his pain, and the other is Isabel, whose brother became a wolf in Shiver. I don't want to spoil anything so I am not going to say much except, THIS SERIES IS A MUST READ!! I can see myself reading these books over and over again, and have suggested this book to all of my book loving friends! The words flowed beautifully, the plot was original and exciting, and the characters were easy to relate to. The third, and final book in the trilogy is called Forever, and will come out July 12, 2011. While Shiver ended on a very happy and promising note, Stiefvater thought it would be fun to torture us and ended Linger with a major cliffhanger. I can not wait to get my hands on Forever! July can not come soon enough!
B000CCIVDO|3.0|I want to like these headphones, the sound is clean and accurate with solid bass.  Sadly, the HPS5000 is the most uncomfortable headset I've ever owned. The ear cups are small and stiff, the overhead plastic band feels like a clamp and is poorly adjustable. Ten minutes and I'm ready to settle for the ratty little speakers in my laptop.
0307405095|5.0|In our area of Michigan there is wonderful fruit available almost all summer starting with Rhubarb in May.  I love this pie book because there are so many variations on lots of pies.  So I tend to make some fabulous combinations that I would not normally think of.  I will combine two of her recipes & fruits that I have used before.  It's great to come home from the Farmers Market with fresh fruit and know that I can make a delicious pie.<br /><br />A lot of her pie recipes came from family and friends and the pictures are wonderful.  I haven't found a single recipe that didn't work out.  (This is not the case with the Entertaining book).<br /><br />I have two copies of this book - one for the summer cottage and one for the winter house - both are well used and loved.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I once read an introduction to one of Robert E. Howard's books that stated he was a \\"natural storyteller.\\"  The writer's point was that, without the ability to tell a story, all the narrative gifts in the world are useless, just as all the trim and finish in the world can't make up for the fact that a boat doesn't float.    By golly, Suzanne Collins is a natural storyteller.  You know how I know?  Because, even though there are some shaky premises to the world she has created, I really didn't care.  For example, I never really got a good grasp on this world she's desrcibing.  It appears to be scattered all around North America, with 12 habitable zones connected by something like high-speed rail.  I never got a good sense as to why the rest of the continent was no longer inhabited, or why anything that rendered so much turf uninhabitable would have spared 12 spots.  Nor did I get a feel for the population.  I sorta got the impression that there were about 20,000 people in her home burg -- but that would give a continental population far too small to uphold the high-tech civilization we witness.  So the background was vague and implausible and didn't hold together.  But I never really cared!  There might have been problems with the setting and the sociology, but she was telling a thoroughly absorbing story, peopled with interesting characters, vivid drama and irony, genuine intrigue, and a few moments of suspense to equal any others I have ever read.  She kept me engrossed and turning pages right up to the end, and even convinced me to plunk down more of my money to buy the second volume, because it's never available at the library.      You can pick up on details of this post-apocalyptic dystopia from other reviews or the publisher's account.  But I'm here to testify that Suzanne Collins has told a really good story, and richly deserves her success.  Enjoy!
0307591549|5.0|Shawn Achor proposes this overarching principle: \\"Happiness is the center, and success revolves around it.\\" (p. 37) Achor depicts happiness like the core of a wheel, powering a smooth and speedy glide, or a lack of happiness putting a brake on the spin of success. This idea is meant to contrast with the notion that success comes first, bringing happiness in its wake.    The author is a management consultant, and he marshals an impressive spread of research from the fields of psychology and management, as well as consulting anecdotes. A witty and concise writer, this book is a joy to read as well. Overall, Shawn Achor argues that increasing people's day-to-day happiness will pay off with more successful teams, more successful organizations, and more success in people's individual careers. He offers big-picture reflections as well as a handy toolkit for increasing one's quotient of the Happiness Advantage.    The author's advice on how to increase happiness in the workplace is meant for anyone in the working world -- not just CEOs. The primary focus is on the person reading the book, sharing advice on how to boost one's own happiness in an organizational context. It speaks to \\"the ripple effect\\" too -- spreading happiness around to others, brightening the ambiance and contributing to overall success.    I like this book a lot. At the same time, I can imagine a results-driven line of skepticism that might ask, aren't we happier when we're winning? One might think that high achievement will tend to give rise to happy people on teams and happiness individually in careers. Right? Shawn Achor says no, it's the other way around -- that happiness is a driver of success in organizations and individual careers. While this book may not fully resolve a chicken-and-egg conundrum to everyone's satisfaction, it surely puts something very good on the table. Achor targets happiness as an independent factor in the workplace. He offers an impressive spread of evidence for the \\"Happiness Advantage\\" and a helpful set of practical tips and techniques. I'm happy that I read it.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|Since our whole family enjoys this wonderful adaptation of the beloved classic and we were disappointed by the DVD release, with its washed colors, we pre-ordered the Blu-Ray set the moment it became available. This release did not disappoint, it is as fresh and colorful as its BBC original (and our VHS copy of it). A pleasure to watch again and again, this movie has no equal amongst all the other P&P adaptations, and it may just have ignited a new reading revolution, seemingly sprouting tens if not hundreds of \\"what-if\\" books or new endings to the original.

B003LL3NOK|3.0|This ain't the greatest zombie movie of all-time. It ain't even near the greatest George A. Romero movie of all time. It is a George A. Romero movie however and if you are a classic slow zombie fan you must see it.<br /><br />The introduction by George A. Romero is kind of funny. He's shooting zombies!<br /><br />The story is pretty much of the zombie version of the Hatfields and McCoys or the Zombie Conservatives vs.the Zombie Liberals. One side wants to kill zombies and be rid of them and the other keeps the zombie family members chained up in hopes of one day rehabing or curing them. All this takes place on an island.<br /><br />One of the selling points for me, for the DVD, was the George A. Romero interview extra. Romero explains how he would like to bring characters over from each of his zombie movies but they are all owned by different people and that means copyright payments. Romero is frustrated by the fact he wrote the movies but can't tell the zombie movie story he wants to put together and tell.<br /><br />I won't spoil a big part of the movie for you but the Obama Zombie Liberals want to rehab the zombies by teaching them to eat some kind of animal instead of humans! Rush Limbaugh would laugh a man's laugh at this line of thinking.<br /><br />This isn't a great, classic horror movie but it is a good little zombie story with a well thought out ending.
B004G600A4|5.0|I've been a Disney fan all my life, but some of their recent offerings haven't been as much fun as they could be. This remake of the Rapunzel story, however, takes me back to my childhood delight. The characters are fun and surprising, with just the right amounts of wicked and winsome.
0316077054|5.0|I don't always have faith in sequels, but I love a good series and \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" was a fine and promising supernatural adventure.  I am so happy to declare that its sequel keeps the magic running and the southern town of Gatlin all the more interesting. The wonderful authoresses have hit their stride in their writing style and tell the story with all the personality of the first in even more skillful prose.  It's simple, but lush and thoughtful and well-suited to this supernatural romance.<br /><br />Lena and Ethan's relationship is struggling due to Lena's depression that followed the events of the first book.  With the choice of Light or Dark still hanging before her, she strays from Ethan's company to follow her Dark cousin Ridley and a strange new boy by the name of John Breed.  Meanwhile, Gatlin's many mysteries deepen.  The result is delicious spooky fun of Caster cats, even more secret tunnels, and plenty more magic.<br /><br />The beloved characters from the first are back, joined by Liv, a British Keeper-in-training.  I daresay their personalities and characters have grown.  They are rich, definite, and deftly balance that fine line between believable and subtle characterization and that zany almost over-the-top quality that makes them memorable.<br /><br />For those that shrug these books off as just more mind candy for the Twilight crowd, these are so much more.  They remind me of the Lois Lowry books I read as a kid, full of atmosphere and bizarre creativity.  These books are astoundingly magical and imaginative with a strong sense of setting.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Darkness\\" is just as magical and captivating as the first, if not more so.

030746363X|1.0|I have been involved in the health and fitness industry most of my life. I have seen trends come and go; diets, supplements, training styles and fitness personalities. Any type of extreme fitness protocols will always fade away and inevitably leave a debris field of injuries, half used supplement bottles,disappointment and disillusionment.<br /><br />Health and fitness is a matter of daily, unremarkable behaviors, behaviors that can be maintained throughout a lifetime, producing visceral, lasting results, and if a particular fitness protocol is only for those who can afford it, and leaves behind huge segments of humanity who have important demands on their finances, then it is little more than self-indulgent elitism. If fitness and well being is for anyone, then it is for everyone.
1400052181|5.0|The most utterly fascinating book I have read in a long time, if not ever. I have done little else this weekend but devour this book.
B004QSQM72|5.0|My first exposure to Wild Beasts was with \\"Devil's Crayon,\\" where Tom Fleming's beautiful baritone voice is most prominent. Then I watched the video for \\"Hooting & Howling\\" and was blown away with how original Hayden Thorpe's falsetto singing is. They truly have a unique sound, and \\"Smother\\" showcases their talents. Listening to these two very different voices is just magical stuff. Much has been made of the fact that this album is a little more somber and doesn't have all the explicit sexuality of their previous two efforts, but there's still that boldness here that draws on references to gay and/or straight lovemaking as metaphors for something more that's going on in the relationships. These are far from your standard love songs. There's a lot of synthesizer work here, but a video that shows Tom and Hayden doing an acoustic version of \\"Reach a Bit Further\\" on a Paris footbridge above passing cars, shows how awesome they sound even with nothing but a single guitar as accompaniment.<br /><br />1. Lion's Share - 4:14 - Starts with a minimal synthesized beat and Hayden doing his wonderful vocal gymnastics, later the tempo builds and Tom provides gorgeous background vocal support. It's one of 2 songs on the album (the other being \\"Plaything\\") in which Hayden plays the part of the boastful lover, bragging about taking the lion's share of the relationship and of his lover's body. Elegant piano playing is mixed in with the synthesized sounds.<br /><br />2. Bed of Nails - 4:18 - Hayden on lead vocal in this mid-tempo song. It's a pronouncement of a masochistic devotion to a lover (\\"I would lie anywhere with you, any bed of nails would do\\"). Continuing in that masochistic theme, the chorus draws on the name of Hamlet's lover, Ophelia, who killed herself over his mistreatment, although in the chorus Hayden and Tom play on the sexual punning that name always invites, and even sing with a Donna Summer-esque, in-the-throes-of-ecstasy moan. (The metaphorical lines about how immersed he feels in his lover's attention are also interesting in that Ophelia drowned herself: \\"Surround me like me a warm bath, set me up like an epitaph.\\" )<br /><br />3. Deeper - 3:01 - Tom has the lead vocals in this slow tempo piece. As their songs often do, the lyrics make reference to the physical act of lovemaking while also suggesting something more metaphorical. Tom's inviting his lover to go deeper with him, realizing the risks of raising their passion -- \\"Dare we put our tongues to the flames.\\" The chorus of \\"deeper, deeper\\" with the harmonizing background vocals is just exquisite to listen to.<br /><br />4. Loop the Loop - 4:06 - A slow song with Hayden on lead vocal. As he said in an NPR interview, it's a song about human acceptance, and he says he picked up some of the lines, like \\"Forget now,\\" from watching Pedro Almodovar's \\"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.\\" There is a chorus line about \\"people are the strangest things\\" and then he explores why in a repeating line that changes its final verb in 3 variations \\"All that the heart requires it what it can't - recognize (1st), compromise (2nd), sympathize (3rd).\\" Basically, I take it to mean we all depend on forgiveness and acceptance, but it's hard to give. The music has a soothing, almost lullaby-ish \\"loop\\" with a bongo and drum supplied rhythm.<br /><br />5. Plaything - 4:21 - Not your typical love song, and brilliant in its courageous boasting. A slow synthesized buzz starts things off, followed by a drumbeat, then Hayden comes directing his lover to \\"take off your chemise, and I'll do as I please.\\" The chorus is the repeated declaration about having the upper hand - \\"You're my plaything.\\" While there's some concession that he's worked to make himself appealing/available --  \\"I've ransacked myself, I've flatpacked for your ease\\" -- there should be no mistaking he's in control, and the song ends with \\"I concur, I conquer.\\"<br /><br />6. Invisible - 2:58 - Tom takes the lead vocal here with a song about the rest of the world becoming irrelevant when a couple is in the throes of love: \\"Things vanish one by one, invisible watch them go.\\"<br /><br />7. Albatross - 3:12 - Beautiful slow-tempo song featuring Hayden on vocals. Albatross is a play on the expression of an \\"albatross around my neck.\\" In this case, the unwanted burden is a lover whom he blames for \\"all of these things I've been through.\\" Still he realizes, with the lover hanging around his neck, that they're in their fate together. Amid all the synthesized sounds there's some beautiful piano playing.<br /><br />8. Reach a Bit Further - 3:36 - In a gorgeous, mid tempo song, Hayden & Tom take turns singing lead vocal. The lyrics are about apologizing to a lover for bad behavior (\\"I was angry and brash as a bull\\"). But with Hayden's lines there's a mischievous bent, as if he's looking for credit for his obsequious stance (\\"Will you by any chance, remember the olive branch?\\"). With Tom's lines, I'm not clear if he's seconding the apology to that third -party lover or if they're intended as a response to Hayden's request - as Tom sings, \\"Yes I will do all the things you ask of me,\\" and it becomes a back and forth dialogue between two lovers. However you read it, the song's a beautiful illustration of how interesting their two voices are juxtaposed.<br /><br />9. Burning - 4:44 - Starts with a jangly synthesized sound and then Tom sings about a lover saving him. He's grateful for the passion his lover has brought him - it feels like he's saved him from a burning building. But while he admires his lover's boldness and courage, he knows he can't match it. (\\"I see you walk into the room, do the thing I can't do\\"). He has to admit that by comparison, he's tentative and weak as different verses end with: \\"I'm ashamed,\\" \\"I'm afraid,\\" and finally, \\"I'll wait.\\"<br /><br />10. End Come Too Soon - 7:33 -The song begins with one of those slightly repetitive rhythms that circles around itself but keeps getting wider and stronger with each revolution. (I saw Here We Go Magic open for The Walkmen and they do a lot of this.) When the lyric portion begins, Hayden sings about disappointment over the fact that the act of physical passion can't last forever, and always must have an end. He sings the praises of his lover: \\"Whose butter fingers read me like Braille? Whose dirty mouth would have made Mary hail? Whose wholesome heart had bore down on me? Who ushers dreamers into such harems?\\" Then those circling rhythms come back in a mesmerizing way, with some chant-like shouting, before Hayden returns to complain, \\"It's too soon\\" and \\"The end it comes too soon.\\"ant when a couple is in the throes of love: \\"Things vanish one by one, invisible watch them go.\\"    7. Albatross - 3:12 - Beautiful slow-tempo song featuring Hayden on vocals. Albatross is a play on the expression of an \\"albatross around my neck.\\" In this case, the unwanted burden is a lover whom he blames for \\"all of these things I've been through.\\" Still he realizes, with the lover hanging around his neck, that they're in their fate together.

B004LL1HM4|5.0|This album has all the same elements that made Fleet Foxes' first, self-titled album spectacular - Robin Pecknold's wonderful, high voice, the terrific harmonizing of the rest of the group, and the beautiful playing of these classic folk/Appalachian instruments - guitar, mandolin, fiddle and more. Thematically, the album is positively brilliant. The songs really carry the listener through an emotional cycle, beginning with regret over self-absorption, to songs about both pain and anger over lost loved ones (not just lovers, but perhaps a father figure too in \\"Sim Sala Bim\\"). The ambivalence and pain over difficult relationships then gives way, ironically in one of the most musically upbeat songs (\\"Blue Spotted Tail\\") to despair that life may have no meaning at all. But that nadir of hope relinquishes to a final, stirring wish in the close-out song, \\"Grown Ocean,\\" that there may be something more, something bigger behind everything, even though the singer is resigned to the fact that he may have to \\"wait all my life to attain it.\\"<br /><br />The 12 songs on the album are:<br />1. Montezuma - 3:37 - A beautiful slow tempo-ed lament about having too much ego. Now that he's reached the age his parent were when they were children, Robin rues the self-centeredness of his youth (\\"could I wash my hands of just looking out for me\\"). As he realizes everyone meets the same end (\\"the slave and the empress will return to the dirt\\"), he's embarrassed by his former self, \\"Oh man what I used to be.\\" (Some astute observers on songmeanings.net noted the line about \\"Montezuma to Tripoli\\" is an allusion to the Marine fight song, which I take as a reference to his former gung-ho-ness.)<br /><br />2. Bedouin Dress - 4:30 - Opens with sweet guitar picking and a foot-stomping rhythm. The singer expresses more regret over the selfish one-sidedness of his past relationships (\\"If to borrow is to take and not return I have borrowed all my lonesome life.\\") He then hopes he can get to Innisfree - the island that served as a metaphor in the famous Yeats poem for the idealistic escape. The song concludes with a memory of seeing a lost lover in a dress so beautiful its design still sticks in his mind. There's some great jazzy sax playing that will be echoed in a later song that also has an Innisfree reference.<br /><br />3. Sim Sala Bim - 3:14 - A wonderful slow, then fast-tempoed song about abandonment by someone important - a father figure maybe. The singer has no respect for what that person's doing now (\\"are you off somewhere reciting incantations/Sim Sala Bim on your tongue\\"), but the singer had his revenge (\\"Remember when you had me cut off your hair, Call me Delilah then I wouldn't care\\"). The final minute is an instrumental, lyric-less flourish of great, fast-tempoed guitar picking with an electric violin and mandolin accompaniment.<br /><br />4. Battery Kinzie - 2:49 - A beautiful mid-tempo song in which Robin sings about losing a woman to another man, who keeps her under tight control.<br /><br />5. The Plains/Bitter Dancer - 5:54 - This song opens with one of those beautiful crescendo-ing chants that was featured more prominently in the last album. When Robin's lyric comes in, it expresses a concern over the return of a troublesome figure (\\"At arm's length I will hold you there\\"). Then there's a short, beautiful a capella bridge in the middle of the song, which gives way to more of that gorgeous harmonizing, simply with repetitions of \\"Oh, oh.\\" Terrific flute playing is laced throughout.<br /><br />6. Helpessness Blues - 5:03 - Begins with another regret about having been raised by the kind of parenting style that gives a child an exaggerated sense of his own importance. Now he longs to be a small part of something larger. (\\"I'd rather be a functioning cog in some great machinery serving something beyond me.\\") That gives way to a fantasy of a simple rural life with a lover. (\\"If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore and you would wait tables andsoon run the store.\\") But then, in what seems a subtle recognition of the fact that the band's folk/Appalachian style of music probably fosters an illusion about their leading a simple, rural lifestyle, he admits he'd like to live up to the fabrication (\\"Someday I'll be the like the man on the screen\\").<br /><br />7. The Cascades - 2:04 - A short, but wonderful instrumental with great guitar, mandolin playing.<br /><br />8. Lorelai - 4:25 - Very upbeat guitar-picking and chanting harmonies, lead into a lyric about annoyance - sung with a beautiful lilt - over becoming irrelevant to an ex-lover. (\\"So I guess I got old, I was like trash on the sidewalk\\" and the catchiest chorus line on the album, \\"I was old news, old news to you then.\\")<br /><br />9. Someone You'd Admire - 2:29 - A slow tempoed song about the multiple personalities - good & evil - that lurk within us, clawing to get out. (\\"One of them wants only to be someone you'd admire; One would as soon just throw you on the fire.\\") Great concluding line about not knowing which side will win out: \\"God only knows which one of them I'll become.\\"<br /><br />10. The Shrine/An Argument - 8:07 -- This gorgeous-sounding and masterful, mini-epic of a song has four distinct parts. In the mid-tempo opening, Robin's sings about times and people gone by and his sense of loss about them, even though he has \\"sunlight over me no matter I do.\\" He puts a penny in a wishing fountain, clearly hoping for reunion with a lost love. Then the tempo picks up and there's an almost angry remembrance of his lover leaving him and erasing him from her memory. (\\"In the ocean washing my name from your throat.\\"  In the 3rd section he's back totrying to talk himself into feeling hopeful in his solitude (\\"Green apples hang from my tree, they belong only to me\\"), but wishing the ocean will carry him out, again, to that metaphorical island of escape - Innisfree. The fourth, and concluding, section is an instrumental with some very modern jazzy saxphone, and the agitation in those sax blurts doesn't suggest he'll find the escape he's hoping for. It's an echo of the sax played with the earlier reference to the Yeats' poem (in \\"Bedouin Dress\\") but the playing now possesses a tension not present in the earlier, simpler fantasy.<br /><br />11. Blue Spotted Tail - 3:05 - Tonally - with the style of singing and playing - this is the easiest going, most upbeat song on the album. But the lyrics themselves are the bleakest. All the existential themes explored in the other songs have now bottomed out to despair and defeat. (\\"Why is life made only for to end?\\" and \\"Why is the earth moving round the sun? Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one.\\")<br /><br />12. Grown Ocean - 4:36 - An ubeat, rocking conclusion about a vision of one day attaining a state of wisdom (Heaven, Nirvana, earthly happiness .. whatever), and there's a hope - which the rousing music makes you feel could be possible - that a state can be attained where everything will make so much sense, you won't need anyone to come to you with answers anymore. The song & album concludes with a beautiful a cappella set of lines about wanting this to dream to come true.tle recognition of the fact that the band's folk/Appalachian style of music probably fosters an illusion about their leading a simple, rural lifestyle, he admits he'd like to live up to the fabrication (\\"Someday I'll be the like the man on the screen\\").    7.

B00009V7OL|5.0|The Abyss is an earlier movie from director James Cameron.  He is the director that brought us Titanic, Avatar, Aliens, Terminator 2 and True Lies.  This is a great movie with added film footage. You get your money's worth and entertainment value.
140131046X|4.0|Mitch Alboim is an outstanding writer and storyteller. He knows how to keep the reader's curiosity alive throughout the narrative. This is true here as it was in the only other book of his I have read, 'Tuesdays with Morrie'. There are in fact close parallels between the two books. In both he spends a great deal of time listening to an aged dying mentor. Here instead of a revered university lecturer the subject is a revered Rabbi. The Rabbi Albert Lewis was Alboim's Rabbi from  childhood years through his Bar- Mitzvah and at a distance through his adult years. He asks Alboim his no doubt most famous congregant to write his eulogy. So they begin a series of discussions which last for over eight years. The Rabbi is a man of integrity, strength, strong faith, great love of people, and an upbeat spirit manifested in his love of song and his great sense of humor. Alboim tells the Rabbi's life - story, one in which a poor Bronx son of Yiddish speaking immigrant parents went on to build a large congregation in his New Jersey shul and serve it for many years. The Rabbi had a loving relationship with his wife Sarah. They had four children one of whom tragically died from a kind of asthmatic attack. The Rabbi is a loving family man and a person greatly admired and loved by his congregants.<br />Rabbi Lewis is however it seems to me a somewhat less interesting character than Morrie whose physical agonies were far greater and who it seems to me had a sharper intellect. Yet everything about the Rabbi is admirable including the way he goes through his long final illness. Even when he himself is gravely ill the Rabbi continues to show concern for the congregants and families he has known for so many years. Along with the story of the Rabbi Alboim tells the story of a black- minister who has through faith in God succeeded in leaving behind a life of crime, drug- dealing. The black Minister has a church for the homeless which Alboim in the course of the story becomes involved in helping become financially solvent. The parallel story enables Alboim to present his major message which is one of the value of Religious Faith and of kind and compassionate behavior. It is a Message which Alboim wants to see is the true religious one, the one which all great faiths share. It is opposed to the kind of narrow- minded religiousness which leads to violent and exclusive contending with others.<br />In a way Alboim's stories here have a kind of American and universal message in regard to Faith.<br />While valuing highly  Alboim's message I would nonetheless raise one question about the enterprise. I wonder if Rabbi Lewis doesn't himself downplay his own traditional message to the Jewish community in regard to Intermarriage. I wonder if Alboim doesn't largely ignore this theme also. After all the theme is a major one in Jewish American life today with Intermarriage seen by many as the major threat to the continued well- being of the community. Would it been more honest for Alboim who himself is intermarried, and the Rabbi to have considered the full implications of this even though it might contradict the overall spirit of the book?become financially solvent.

B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This is a really solid game that's easy to pick up and play, but that has lots of detail once you learn the finer points.
0061433047|5.0|Wonderful, just wonderful. The wonder, the magic, the language, the positive image of young woman's competence and power -- it's all here in Terry Pratchett's latest book. If you're a Terry Pratchett fan, this is a must-read.<br /><br />If you're not -- now is the time to get started on this most wonderful addiction... This follows up on a prior book with this character, but you don't need to read the previous book to enjoy this one -- though do yourself a favor and read the previous one anyway. You'll be glad.<br /><br />Then get all his previous books. You'll be poorer in your pocket and richer in your heart.
0061733199|5.0|This book has it all and was written by a professional Suvivalist with 26 years of training, most of it I already knew, but some things I re-learned, things I had forgotten from 30 years ago and rarely use in the bush anymore ~smiles~.    If you want to survive, or at least greatly improve yer chances, even a newb civilian can understand this book ~smiles~.    Would be a great investment for those who have been out of the loop for a while to refresh as well ~smiles~.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Good product, delivery was slow and not on the date requested but came a few days later. Worked well and well packaged. Seemed to be missing the booklet that normally comes with these dvd packages but dvds were all there and working great.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This was actually purchased as a gift but we saw it in the movie theatre and I have never heard/saw my children laugh so much at a movie. They loved this movie so much we have rented it a few times since seeing it at the theatre, I guess I should have bought a copy for us as well.      Delivery was fast with Amazon Prime.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Nostalgia, refreshing new characters, and solid animation are among the strengths of the movie.<br /><br />- Back to the old days. Many flashbacks, familiarity, and fond memories are brought back and fused with the new story line.<br /><br />- Plot. Awesome! The daycare provides a good setting for an interesting story.<br /><br />- New characters. The new characters are a welcomed addition and my favorite is Ken. The relationship between Ken and Barbie is hilarious, cute, and entertaining throughout the movie.<br /><br />Themes of family, teamwork, childhood, and growing up are present in this movie. Great for kids and adults alike.
0451228375|5.0|This was the book that I took with me everywhere, trying to sneak a page or two here and there. This was the book that kept me up at night. This was the book that, when I hear of someone who is just beginning to read it, it makes me jealous.  Read it.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|My favorite movie of 2008!<br /><br />-Wonderful score. One of the best I've heard. Adds a lot to the scenes.<br /><br />-Great storytelling. Flashbacks and time changes were not confusing. Very well crafted.<br /><br />- Settings, costumes, props, buildings, lighting, everything just worked together flawlessly.<br /><br />- Character development was phenomenal, especialy for benjamin button. You could really feel his struggles and lack of experience throughout the movie. The scene in which the main characters cross ages almost the same is beautifully done.<br /><br />You'll come out of the experienced amazed with benjamin's life.<br /><br />I'll leave with a wonderful quote (the response to the wonders of death):<br /><br />\\"If they don't die, then you won't know how important they were to you\\"
B004XZR63M|4.0|This is a very interesting book. I finished it in two days; was so hooked to it once I started reading. I wish I had read it 10 years back. It would have helped me save a lot more money than I have today.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|The Smiths are a gifted bunch and I'm looking forward to seeing him in more movies. Jackie Chan also shines as the usual marital artist, but his acting is surprisingly good<br /><br />- Action. Can't ask much for more. The fighting scenes and competition at the end is entertaining<br /><br />- Story. So well done, you'd start to feel his fear of being bullied. Mr. Han's story is also well crafted and presented.<br /><br />- lessons. Hard work and  perseverance are emphasized throughout the movie, especially with the constant jacket routine. You'd feel his pain and impatience.<br /><br />Good movie for both kids and adults. Touches upon childhood romance and mildly on struggles of parenthood
B0015DROBO|1.0|LONG drawn out explanation of a million different characters, of which the main character is odd and unrelatable.  Boring plot and setting until the VERY end of the book.  I kept reading thinking it's a best seller and would eventually be interesting but was disappointed when the interesting part was over so fast. Would NOT recommend this book!  I bought all three of the series so hopefully with all the background information out of the way, the second and third books will be more action and less fluff.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Bam! Angelie Jolie continues to shine as an action star<br /><br />- Solid story. A very epic and exclusive approach. It makes you feel like you're part of the movie and training to be an assassin. Very cool<br /><br />- special effects. Awesome! Nice slow motion, focus, and effects.<br /><br />- motivation. You'll come out of the movie feeling motivate do make something of your life.
B00007E7K0|5.0|Item was exactly as described.   I had lost my previous one & needed another to replace it...& this one fit just right!  Works like a charm.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|Jake Gyllenhalal and Anne Hatheway are both established and rising stars. Before the release of the movie, I was definitely intrigued with this duo. I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />- Story. The Viagra story is nicely crafted into this movie. The scenes that satire the drug's success is interesting and comical.<br /><br />- Believable romance. The chemistry between Jake and Anne is very realistic and believable.<br /><br />- Love scenes. Wow, I wasn't expecting this much, but there is a a lot of sex scenes and nudity. I mean, A LOT.<br /><br />- Parkinson's theme representation was decent. The movie explored the disease just enough to not bore me.<br /><br />Overall, entertaining romance flick.
1594202842|4.0|First few chapters summarise the  main thesis of the book..Punchy, tiger claws attract ...Chinese astuteness and fierce household routines..Promising  start..      After that, the bubble bursts and  the book becomes  another  litany of  \\"my daughter's great achievements at school\\". No literary turns of thought to keep the flotsam and jetsom afloat...All the secrets given away  at the beginning ,then an unsatisfactory  bunch of fillers and \\" how do we end this book ?\\" musings..       But, by all means get it ,if you need  a kick up the pants  to  stop your laissez fairey parental ways..
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Steve Carell's personality and voice shines!<br /><br />-colorful and good characters. All of the characters are painted beautifully. Cute, funny, sad, and all of the emotions bundled up into one movie. The minions are very amusing and are funny every time they appear during the movie.<br /><br />-Good animation. The actual CGI and look of the character models, textures, and color are impressive. No complaints here.<br /><br />- Strong moral/life lesson emphasis. Almost sublimely done, themes of family, love, sacrifice, and compassion are present.<br /><br />A good movie for kids and adults alike.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|~ START DATE:  16 May 2011 - Day 1     I wanted a diet that didn't require counting & measuring - just give me simple and give me results! That is exactly what I got from The Dukan Diet!! I lost 10 pounds in 4 days! I am someone who's daily fluid intake was several mugs of coffee with Hazelnut flavored liquid creamer, a huge sweet tooth and ate whatever I wanted whenever I felt like it. Since I started this diet  I drink one cup of coffee in the morning with splenda and non-dairy powdered creamer and I drink 84 ounces of water throughout the day every day. I will be honest the first day was the hardest, I literally kept telling myself I can get through this one day. I took it one day at a time and it got easier by day two and by day three it was like night and day - you won't believe just how much easier it gets! I can not wait to weigh myself on day 10 of this Attack Phase! I am following his instructions and eating strictly protein. I Love this diet and am so excited about the benefits I am getting and will continue to get as I follow it for my Health and Weight/Appearance.  The quick weight loss is the best motivator and more! I also feel proud of the healthy changes I am making and that with the ongoing weight loss really makes me feel great about myself!! I finally found something that works for me.       ** UPDATE #1   01 June 2011 - 18 DAYS On The ATTACK PHASE:        I am 5'9\\" tall and almost 46 years old.  I have lost 15 pounds since May 16th, 2011 and I even have my period so I am expecting to weigh even less soon.  I am continuing with the Attack Phase. I have so many allergies, (indoor/outdoor and various foods) that every week I go for an allergy shot.  I still get my weekly allergy shots but am so happy that I no longer have to take a Zyrtec every single day nor have I had to use my nasal spray.  I am thrilled by the results because they are more than just aesthetic.  I was 200 lbs and now I weigh 184 lbs. :)
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Absolutely amazing animation film. The CGI is mind blowing and still is one of the best animation flicks ever.<br /><br />- Stars, ships, buildings, and everything is realistic and pretty to the eye<br /><br />- Romance. Wow! Great job showing the love between Eve and wall E<br /><br />- Interesting injection of current issues. No Pixar movie has had such a smart and thought provoking movie. Themes of obesity and environmental issues were very much  important parts of the movie. They were presented in a subtle but still pleasant manner.<br /><br />Well done!
1595826971|5.0|[...]    This book depicts amazing, macabre and wonderfully disturbing art. The talented artists behind the video game The Art of Alice: Madness Returns (Electronic Arts will publish the game in 2011 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC) have helped create a book of their journey from original concepts to the finished product.    In 2000 the PC game American McGee's Alice emerged as an early action adventure game and then kind of faded into obscurity. 11 years later McGee and EA are releasing a sequel to his macabre work. Dark Horse Comics and Spicy Horse Games have given fans a 184 page sneak-peak at the game and an amazing visual experience. The concept art work is captioned by McGee or a producer telling how a picture was created and describes the goal they were trying to achieve. There are also many finished pieces that made it into the game. There is an introduction by McGee and the rest of the book is broken down into chapters that focus on different aspects of the game such as locations, characters, and Alice's costumes. You also get to see some brainstorming sketches that were eventually scrapped for one reason or another.    The art work is beautiful and horrible at the same time. Horror fans, gamers and casual or occasional readers of comic like me will appreciate this collection. This isn't your mother's Wonderland .      5 Artistically creepy sheep!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Heath Ledger's death added to the movie's hype, but this movie is still quite the experience<br /><br />-Awesome score. Hans Zimmer is amazing.<br /><br />-Good settings, costumes, props, and of course the batman toys.<br /><br />- Edge of your seat action and drama<br /><br />- Two-face is very dynamic. Aaron Eckhart had a breakout performance. I'm looking forward to his next batman movie role.<br /><br />Overall, a well spent 2.5 hours. Characters, scenes, and everything about this movie is believable and sometimes hauntingly possible.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I came by this title a few months ago, of course there was no english dub yet, so I won't be able to comment on the english voice actors.  But, what I can tell you about, is this awesome show.  The replay value of this flick is unbelievably high and I haven't even scene it in english yet.  The story was so well told, the flow was so smooth, the action was so vivid and intense, and the characters were so very life like and human (well the martial arts was maybe a little too awesome for human standards but who cares IT'S Martial arts, I mean, I bet you Jet Li or Jackie Chan could do it).  I was always on the edge of my seat waiting for the next development, I have to honestly say that this anime did such an outstanding job on the whole zombie thing it made me want more zombies even though zombies have been soo over played over the decades that I couldn't care less for the next zombie flick.  When the series ended I wanted so much more that I just had to go back to the beginning and watch it again.  The flick is almost completely flawless but like everything else in the world nothing is perfect and the only problem I had with the show was the fan fare.  Way too much, but I must say they did some pretty cool things with the cg and some of the girls bossism ;).  Plainly the show just didn't need it, any true fan or even your plain John and Jane Doe would love this flick with out the fan fare.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show to anybody well... as long as your old enough to watch and enjoy.
B002ZG980U|5.0|One of the best cinematic experiences to date<br /><br />-wonderful cast. Star studded and from leonardo dicaprio to Ellen Page, all of the actors and actresses give top notch performances. I was particularly entertained with Tom Hardy's performance. He is very believable as the wise one in the bunch. He provides many laughs and adds some light-heartedness to the film.<br /><br />-unprecedented plot. Wow! I was blown away with the plot and story. Original and very innovative. The complex dream levels were crafted well.<br /><br />-Special effects. Amazing! Whether it's the snow, city, slow motion, or train, special effects add the fantastical part of the film. Very immersive and breathtaking.<br /><br />- thought provoking. Definitely makes you think, far after movie ends. I won't disclose whether I believe the totem falls, because that's the beauty of Nolan's work: making you wonder and interpret the way you would like to.
B003L45JLW|5.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers in that this is maybe the best LP since Wildflowers. TP & the HB show that not only can they do Blues; but, that they can do it really, really well. Mike Campbell is on fire throughout - he's been given free range to show off his considerable talent.  I believe he's one of the top five rock n roll guitar players ever, maybe the best.  Tom Petty has an inate gift to surround himself with the best.  When Stan Lynch left I was very disappointed and thought he'd never be able to replace him. However, Steve Ferrone has turned out to be a pleasant surprise and although he has a different style that Stan Lynch, he fits in so seamlessly that it again shows TP's talent for adding just the right drummer to fill Stan Lynch's big shoes. Thats all for now.  Buy MOJO & buy it NOW!!!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|You will laugh your socks off!<br /><br />-The mock trailers at the beginning of the movie is absolutely hilarious<br /><br />- The satire of different \\"stereotypical\\" movie stars was well done.<br /><br />- Robert downey jr does a great job as the film's lead. Jack black and ben stiller still provide comedic flare.<br /><br />- Great satire and ideas.  Ideas from platoon and other movies were used to make this a unique movie experience.<br /><br />- Cameo with Tom Cruise. I've no words to say. He is comedic gold in this film. Experience it yourself if you haven't already.<br /><br />Wonderful to watch everyone once in a while. Guaranteed to make your laugh every time
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I still have not recieved the May update! i want to keep playing but cant! when will it come??? this sucks
B003UYV08E|5.0|Awesome sequel. The movie keeps what works (strong character development, great action sequences, entertaining script) and adds in some new (characters, sex appeal, racing)<br /><br />- Action packed. Racing scene was particularly one of my favorites.<br /><br />- Suit. Impressive and flashy. Loved it!<br /><br />- Themes. I liked how family was weaved into the plot. You could relate with him throughout the movie. I also liked how the movie emphasized hard work as one of the determinants of success.<br /><br />A+ Can't wait for the third.
0765356147|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. There were points in the second book where I had to keep struggling to continue, but compared to some other books I've read, there weren't that many. I would recommend these books to others. The overall concept of burning metals or storing things into metals was quite interesting. I love a good scifi read, and this proved to be different then any other books I've recently read. By the time I got to the end I could only think, \\"wow. How did I not see that?\\" All of the pieces fit together nicely. The ending was amazing. Bravo, Saunderson. These books have officially made it to my favorites shelf on the bookcase.
0439023521|5.0|Oh my. I just finished this book and now I want to go out and buy the second one. Now. I don't think I can wait till it comes in at the library. I couldn't put it down, and stayed up into the wee morning hours reading the past 2 nights.<br /><br />I was appalled at first by the premise of the book - how the government puts on a game show where kids are chosen as tributes by drawing names out of a bowl. The tributes are then put in an arena and forced to hunt each other down and be the last survivor on live television. Honestly, I didn't think I would like it or want to finish. I loved it. I'm so glad I was curious enough to know what all the fuss was about and requested it from the library.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is well written with both lovable and despicable characters. It's a story of survival, love, and friendship. I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed a book so much! I highly recommend this book, though I think it more suitable for older teens and adults. This is not a children's book!

B000H6H81Q|5.0|My son has lots of Schleich toys and they are all great quality, virtually indestructible, and wonderfully detailed and lifelike. The Mammouth is bigger and heavier than the typical Schleich animal. I wouldn't recommend it for a very small child just because it is so heavy, but for an older kid who is interested in prehistoric wildlife it's a great buy. Most Mammouth toys are usually cartoon type tie-ins for the Ice Age movie series, so my little boy was excited to find a \\"real\\" looking Mammouth.
1563894696|5.0|I'm new to comics. But I love Batman. I read a list on ign.com about the 25 best batman comics to read. My Dad has that awesome Year One/Dark Knight Returns/Batman Christmas (or whatever that middle one was). I read that whole thing in one sitting. I was amazed. The two best Batman comics in one day. So I have been working that list and I bought the Long Halloween. It is a really great story about Dent and how Two Face comes to be. The mystery is awesome, although I was kind of confused about the ending. Maybe when I re-read it before I get to Dark Victory it will become clear.     Like I said, I'm new to comics, so it was awesome to see the reference from the Dark Knight on the building with Batman, Gordon, and Dent. \\"He does that.\\" I love it. I do have one small complaint. I read a review saying he wasn't impressed with the artwork, that the Joker looks stupid. I think the artwork is awesome, but I do agree that the Joker's teeth look crazy and not realistic at all. But it didn't prevent me from enjoying the story, so ultimately who cares. 5/5

0802798225|5.0|This was a great YA romance.  Alex is a gang member; Brittany is the high school princess.  When the two are assigned as lab partners in Chemistry class, their worlds begin to turn upside down.  They are powerfully drawn to each other and both are willing to sacrifice their worlds to be with each other.  Alex and Brittany are well-written characters and readers will get totally swept away by their stories and how much they go through to be with each other.  This was a great read and I enjoyed it.  I want to read the next book, Rules of Attraction.<br /><br />[...]
B004V7EXO2|5.0|Paul Simon's influence is currently as infectious as a rash as evidenced in the recent excellent free CD from Uncut \\"Homeward bound\\" which demonstrates his impact on artists as diverse as Nathaniel Ratcliff, Villagers, Doug Paisley, Josh Ritter and let us add more recently the Fleet Foxes. \\"So beautiful or what\\" is like all Simon's album you pick out snatches of melody or a clever lyric upon your first listen. Further deeper plays reveal vivid storytelling, compelling rhythms and a great pop sensibility which doesn't betray the real depth to found here in what is a very spiritual record.<br /><br />We would all recognise that there is a classic Paul Simon template song which draws together all the elements above and the bouncy opener \\"Getting ready for Christmas day\\" is one such track. Its feel is more New Orleans than Yuletide carol but it is completely infectious and a great start. Next up is the \\"Afterlife\\" a complex shuffle of rhythm and lyrics which sees Simon narrating a tale of an ordinary mortal's rather bureaucratic passage to heaven to meet his maker. The jazzy \\"Dazzling blue\\" draws on those sparkling Graceland harmonies and bubbling guitar backdrop as does the brilliant title track which tackles the assassination of Martin Luther King in a fantastic song which is so loose its almost tight. Your feet will tap wildly and you will press the repeat button as soon as it concludes. Another standout is \\"Rewrite\\" which is underpinned by a flowing sitar and which Vampire Weekend will no doubt utilise as a primary source in the not to distant future and ironically could sit happily alongside \\"I think ur a contra\\" almost as a distant cousin. It wouldn't be a proper Paul Simon if it lacked some deeply beautiful melancholy and the utterly gorgeous \\"Questions for the angels\\" is a delicate beauty and a lovely reflection on the human condition where Simon observes in a passing line that \\"Downtown Brooklyn/The pilgrim is passing a billboard/That catches his eye/It's Jay-Z/He's got a kid on each knee/He's wearing clothes that he wants us to try\\". Another hark back to some of the preoccupations of Gracelands comes in the storming \\"Love is the eternal sacred light\\" which revisits the \\"bombs of the marketplace\\" mentioned in the \\"Boy in the bubble\\" and contains the sharp barb to playlist FM stations that we should \\"Check out the radio, pop music station/That don't sound like my music to me/Talk show host, what's that boy's name?/Politics is ugly\\". Simon as you can tell is on top form lyrically and the gently rolling guitar instrumental \\"Amulet\\" is no throwaway but adds real depth to the album.<br /><br />\\"So beautiful or so what\\" is both a sparkling and thoughtful album from a great songwriter who doesn't always get his dues. The dread words \\"return to form\\" do apply with a vengeance here particularly after the patchy \\"Surprise\\" album. which was a a real curates egg. One of the best songs on here is the quietly funky \\"Love and Blessing\\" where Simon states there \\"ain't no song like an old song Charlie\\". Whatever the case old or new, Simon deserves the highest praise and massive respect for a glorious music career which on this evidence shows him back to his best. Unreservedly recommendedot a kid on each knee/He's wearing clothes that he wants us to try\\".

B002ZFQD0E|4.0|Janelle Monae is unquestionably an extremely talented young woman (and snappy dancer to boot).  Every element of this album is beautifully orchestrated, or wonderfully beat-y, or thought-provoking.  And yet, as a whole it feels bloated and random.  Rather than building to an epiphany in the way my favorite concept album, Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On,\\" does, it rambles.    Still there are many great moments on this CD and I look forward to following her career.
0316098329|3.0|I listened to the CD of this book.  I found the voice of the child was unrealistic when he used many words a 5 year old wouldn't use and annoying when he consistently referred to inanimate objects as personified.  He didn't use \\"the\\" with nouns.  I may have felt differently if I had read rather than listened to the book.    Admittedly it is quite an undertaking to write a novel from the perspective of a child.  I give Emma Donoghue credit for this.  Also, I realize when she wrote, she was probably typing, in black and white, so she wasn't hearing what she was writing.  Sound adds a whole new dimension.     I found this book totally different from Slammerkin, which I couldn't put down.  I will definately read more by this author.  I think she is talented and interesting.  I would be interested in learning more about her.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I come away from this album feeling like I am witness to a significantly and singularly important, momentous musical birth.  I have not been this excited about a group since I got my first Muse album in 2005.  Not that they sound like Muse, but they're Muse-like in their intricacies of music genre combinations and stylistic changes from song to song all the while keeping cohesiveness in the album.  They both also have a sort of rage against authority theme with exquisite lyrics.    And to think I found AWOLNATION in the most round-about way.  I was watching a cool video about dancing Android robots and Sail was the background music.  I HAD to know who the group was and where the song came from.  Thank god for apps like Soundhound.  I located a video of theirs on Youtube and was just stunned.  After watching a couple videos I headed straight for Amazon.  I HAD to have this album and was shocked and thrilled by the price.  I listened to this album over and over again last night and I'm listening to it again right now for the third time this evening.  I can already tell I'll be listening to this almost daily.    There is no simple classification for AWOLNATION.  Their music is complex, but completely accessible.  I hear a blend of alternative rock, indie, hip hop, electric, fabulous choruses, hints of Beatles, Pink Floyd, Traffic, and even heavy metal. Always there is a driving beat, heavy bass and percussion and something that is constantly stirring some deep musical memory in my mind that I can never quite put a finger on, and so many of the choruses are almost instantaneously absorbed so that you find yourself singing right along.    The first song is kind of what I'd call an introduction, like you'd find in a book.  This is a hint of who we are, but now you need to read the book.  And the second piece (it's not a song) is reminiscent to me of a quirky tidbit out of a Tom Robbins book.  From there on out the album continues to build and build with every new song andeach is different.  No doubt, Sail is a star.  There is something magnificently anthem-like about it.  It makes me want to stand up and cheer.  However, you'd be hard-pressed to find a single slacker in this album.  What a rarity.  So many albums today have one or two good songs, but an entire album of songs that all could individually be chart hits?!?!  Wow.  While many of the tunes can be bouncy or boisterous or even marvelously frenetic, All I Need is so much like a Beatles tune it's startling. It's not a cheap imitation.  It's just that good and the singer sounds almost like Lennon.  There are so many other songs on this album that I simply worship-adore, like Jump on My Shoulders, Kill Your Heroes, Wake Up, and Knights of Shame.  The rest I just love. lol     I shall be evangelizing this group and this album to anyone and everyone who will listen because I so want them to be successful and produce more and more for years and years to come.  Do not hesitate.  Buy this album!

B000089Q9D|5.0|I've loved this movie for a long time, and I'm glad to own the original version of the movie now.  The extended cut causes the movie to lose its magic and changes everything.

I love that I'm able to do that.   Recommend!
0316056863|5.0|In her latest book, Bossypants, Tina Fey comes at you from all angles. Her humor is dimensional and sprinkled with all kinds of what may best be described as sneak attacks. The pictures of her growing up! I'd be impressed with anyone who saw those hairdos coming! It's more, though, than the dated \\"looks\\" or \\"dos\\" that are hilarious. Those are just icing on the cake, if you ask me. Listen if you've got ears to hear because Tina Fey's got something to say. She is a storyteller. And a wise and funny one.  Among the many gems in Bossypants there are 3 stories that stand out for me. There's the chapter about when she was at summer theatre camp where she's hanging out with her mostly \\"in the closet\\" gay and lesbian friends and how she comes to witness homophobic discrimination and speaks up. There's the chapter about working at Saturday Night Live where you get behind-the-scenes glimpses of her days and late nights there working with a strong circle of women comics, the gifts and challenges of being a female comic and her male comic colleagues peeing in jars! And then there's the chapter about her dad. I'm here shaking my head and grinning just thinking about that one. My favorite thing about Bossypants is that it's a life tour and through the lenses of Fey's mind, heart and eyes the reader gets to experience how a very funny person frames her world. When you do come to the book's end you might just find yourself finding life a little bit funnier than before.

B003L77GG0|1.0|It's official, Smallville butchered Superman.   The series stuck to its original goal of preventing Clark from becoming the Man of Steel for as long as possible. And when he finally does change, the scene are the worst Superman scenes to be filmed. There's only two maybe three shots of Tom Welling in the suit and the rest of the time Superman is shown in a far away shot done with incredibly poor computer animation.  The series decided to do its own version of Superman saving an airplane and its absolutely pathetic. The film Superman Returns has a far superior scene and it even won several awards for it. But that's because that film was actually done by Superman fans and by people who had actually read the comics. Smallville clearly isn't done by Superman fans and they maybe have read about ten issues, and obviously hated them. Hence the reason why Smallville stays away from Superman for so long and doesn't even give the characters their original names.  The Blur? Velocity? What stupid names to give Superman and The Flash.   Now what really is awful about the finale is how it ends. Lex is barely in it, and maybe the actor had two, three days of filming. (but more than likely just one.) And Clark doesn't even fight Lex or Darkside. I was at least expecting a fight scene between the those two once Clark became Superman, but no he just moves the fire ball away in the last ten minutes of an hour and half show. The whole episode is horrible and boring because most of it is Clark and Lois complaining about getting married and complaining about their futures. Boring!  Now if people really want to see a good version of Superman, check out the animated films from DC Animated Warner Studios. Those films are marvelous, stay true to the comics, get PG-13 ratings because of all the action, and they show why cartoons are the best way to deliver comic books as movies. Live action films are just horrid, cartoons, that's where it's at.
B0025KW29U|5.0|One of the great tv pleasures of the past 15 years has been watching the insane yet profound imagination of Joss Whedon unfold. It is unfortunate that his most recent tv ventures--Firefly and Dollhouse--were cancelled so quickly; because of the short time given to them on the air, we were not allowed to see how the story arcs would have developed (as had the longer running Buffy and Angel shows). Dr. Horrible, which I only just recently was exposed to (my internet awareness is, admittedly, limited), once again displays the witty and wild sides of Mr. Whedon. And, most importantly, it also displays his depth of understanding of the human psyche--as the story's protagonist is faced with the ultimate consequences of his choices. I know of no other artist in the modern video media who is so able to entertain and instruct us at the same time. Bravo!
B004XWLN20|1.0|Smallville killed Superman, the creators obviously hated the character and that's why they stay away from him for so many years. And when they finally bring in Superman, he is animated poorly, has just three close up shots, and the scenes with him are incredibly poor renditions of classic Superman events. This is due to the fact that the creators clearly read maybe ten issues of the Superman and hated them so they decided to reboot him as winey teenager who becomes a winey adult and only one time is referred to as Superman. Most of the time he's given a really stupid name called the Blur or he saves people as just Clark. Problem with that is Clark never wears glasses and isn't nerdy to hide his identity. So when Superman arrives everyone knows its Clark.  For about half of the series the show is teen drama with small amounts of Superman events, but most of it is just kids wining about their lives and messing up their chances to hook up with each other. The other half of the show delivers a bit more Superman events but ends up giving all the action to Green Arrow. And that doesn't make any sense, everything Green Arrow does is what Clark should have done as Superman. But because Clark doesn't become Superman until the last ten minutes of the last episode, Green Arrow does all the action Clark should have been doing.  Or during the season Supergirl shows up, she does all the action Clark should do, but since he's not Superman, Clark doesn't get to do the action.  The creators also took it upon themselves to ruin Doomsday. They basically turn his character into a poor version of the Hulk. Doomsday spends most of the time as human who turns into a monster when he gets angry or jealous. And then he kills Jimmy Olson, what kind of Superman world would it be without Jimmy Olson? A stupid one created by people who hated the world of Superman and decided to change it poorly.   There is one good episode of the series and that is when the Justice League raid a plant owned by Lex. But that doesn't occur until about halfway through the series. Reason why that episode is good is because they characters finally perform Superman actions and are given a story which is ripped from the comics. And that is interesting story telling, but there are barely any episodes like that in this show. Small amounts of action occur in the last fifteen minutes of a episode and the rest of it is just talking about feelings and have the characters feeling sorry for themselves. Boring, and not Superman at all.  Now for those that want to watch good films of Superman and other comic book heroes, check out the animated films from DC Films Animated Studios. The films are done by fans of the comics and they stay true to the characters. Films are released about every six months, they're just under an hour and a half, and end up getting PG-13 ratings because of all the action. You get more action in 80 minutes than in an entire season of Smallville.

B0051YGX6U|4.0|I love this show, and I don't want to spoil anything.  If you are a Supernatural fan you have to watch this.  I enjoyed Jared Padlecki's performance (which was a nice bookend with the paired finale episode, \\"Let it  Bleed,\\" which showcased Jensen Ackles).  But the plot twist at the end of the show made me feel bad.(Last season's finale, \\"Swan Song,\\" was poetic, tearjerking, and uplifting).  I hope the show's producers and writers allow redemption and not destruction of a very favorite character in Season Seven.  Those guys are the reason we watch the show!
B002TVQ4GW|1.0|Allowing for the possibility that I am just too dense to understand it, this seems as pointless as it is boring. With the same repetitive scenes that make little if any point the first time, any more than the rest.  Certainly not plausible, even for fiction, this is bizarre film of a crew that takes a cruise on a small boat, capsizes in the Bermuda Triangle, its passengers rescued by a passenger ship without passengers or crew.  One of the woman keeps reappearing, after being killed over and over again, frequently by herself (a double, triple, etc.)  I watched this my wife who agreed with this.  Even the genre is not clear  -- not exactly a horror film; certainly not a mystery, except for the mystery of why it was even made.  Don't waste your time or money.
031603438X|4.0|If you want a book that is not 'told' by Keith Richards and takes a different perspective on his life, this is not the book for you.  But if you want to read Keith Richards' story, as he tells it, then you will enjoy the book.   It is a bit surprising what he focuses on and what he remembers and what was important, but it does give you insight into who he is and how his mind (and vocabulary) work.   As first I couldn't believe how bad the writing was and how rambling and superficial the content seemed but when I got done with it, I thought 'hey keith, hats off to you and three cheers'.   The book is about life - his life.  What I really liked was that after all he went through - particularly the addiction to heroin, things turned out ok for him.  He remained close to his children, has had a good marriage to Patti, made peace with his father, respected his mother and now it appears has some time for a rather nice life in his retirement.  We can't make him into something else or ask him to remember about things we might be interested in.  This is the story he wanted to tell and he told it in his way.  And in the end, you will come to understand even more what the saying 'sex, drugs and rock and roll' means and why it is 'only rock and roll but i like it'.
0670022411|4.0|I could not put this book down. I tried to go to sleep when I was a little passed half way through but my mind kept turning to it so I got up and read some more. I ended up finishing a little after dawn. At first I wasn't too sure if I'd be interested but some how I got sucked into the book.    It's a strange combination of fantasy fiction and science. It does run on a little long and I think there second half should have been a second book. The 2 halves didn't flow together too well but that can be overlooked if you are really into the plot.    I recommend this book to anyone who likes a touch of logic with the whimsical.

B002ZG99IG|2.0|After watching this film, it is obvious that Cam Gigandet needs a good deal of work in terms of his acting. He was awful in this film. And talk about a twinner, the two female leads look so much alike that one can barely tell Minka Kelly and Leighton Meester apart. Both actresses are annoying when they try to be cute, and over the top when they try to be sinister. As for the movie plot, if you have seen \\"Single White Female\\" than you know what happens with this film. Combine that film with a little bit of \\"Cruel Intentions\\" and you get this film.<br /><br />It has every standard cliche, right down to the sappy male love interest, the horny male college professor, and a slew of dormatory co-eds who are clueless as to what is going on. Particularly awful in her role is the girl from Aly & AJ. This actress actually struggles with playing a sleazy, partying college girl.<br /><br />Meester does alright through most of the film, and she does have a charming innocence about her, kind of a girl next door thing, and it works. But there are just too many dull moments, and the suspensful scenes are not that suspenseful. Other than boasting an attractive young cast, this film has very little to offer, and is below the grade of many made-for-TV movies.

B004F9OV5C|5.0|After three consecutive disappointing reads - all much lauded literary fiction titles touted as among the year's best - I was more than ready for a pick me up, so as if to prove the critics wrong, I turned to William Boyd's latest, the critically ignored \\"Ordinary Thunderstorms (OT)\\", for relief and boy, was I glad I did ! It rekindled the joy of reading I thought I'd lost after the recent slog.       Boyd is no literary slouch as readers of serious fiction will know - his \\"Any Human Heart\\" is a timeless masterpiece and \\"Restless\\" is also excellent. With OT, he experiments boldly with the page turning thriller genre and proves himself equally adept, producing a real heartstopper, rivaling and not a million miles away from the kind of literary novel Ian McEwan writes with such great aplomb (think \\"Saturday\\", for instance). Less dark perhaps, but you get the drift. The story is crawling with greedy, selfish and unsavoury types but the scene is London and in big bustling cities you get more than your average share of these bad human specimens.         OT has been panned by some readers for its absurdly implausible plot - I have no problems with that. What is implausible about contemplating a casual spontaneous act leading to a spiraling personal nightmare that completely transforms one's existence and identity ? We watch such stories on tv or in the movies all the time but we don't complain. It can happen to anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time. A bit of harmless escapism perhaps, but surely it can't hurt to go on an impossibly thrilling ride to nowhere if that's what the author has promised in the blurb of the book?    There are a couple of plots running alongside each other and they all come together and tie up nicely in the end. However, plotwise, the denouement could have been stronger  - it didn't quite deliver the decisive knockout punch I was expecting. Having said that, Boyd may have been more concerned that we readers noticed how the gruelling nightmarish existence endured by our protagonist had turned a victim into a criminal, albeit under extenuating circumstances. That alone should send a shudder through us.    OT may not be Boyd's best work - I will leave that to the experts - but it brought me great enjoyment and for that I am grateful.

They probably think all it can do is repeat after them, and of course it will get boring pretty quickly that way.<br />The way I use it is to record and share messages. Now if you consider how much this app costs (nothing), why would you complain and give it one star??? This just makes me angry...
0198711913|3.0|I am reviewing the first edition of this work, which I have had for many years now. It is not your standard edition of the complete Shakespeare. Those coming to the plays for the first time should be warned off this version, since it does NOT present the plays complete. It presents them with passages cut, and the omitted passages included at the end of each play, with notes as to where the cuts were actually made. In other words, Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film of \\"Hamlet\\", which features the whole play, is actually more complete than the version included in this volume. These passages were supposedly cut with the approval of Shakespeare and his acting company, though how the editors arrived at that conclusion, it is difficult to know. Of course, the volume is beautifully printed. My copy is a huge hardcover edition, probably its first printing ever, and the binding does not appear to be weak, since it has held up for quite a while.<br /><br />I have owned several editions of Shakespeare's complete works, and all of the others gave you each play complete, and with no lines published as an appendix as the Oxford Shakespeare does. (And these are not lines that nobody has ever read or heard, but standard lines that frequently are retained when the plays are produced onstage.) The editors have tried to make their edition unique and different by publishing it like this, but whether you prefer reading edited versions of the plays and then the omitted lines as appendices is strictly up to you. I am reluctant to criticize this book as it simply looks truly beautiful, but I prefer Shakespeare's plays complete. I leave edited versions of the plays to film directors such as Orson Welles or Franco Zeffirelli. It's one thing to watch a two hour Shakespeare film, but quite another to read an abridged version of a Shakespeare play.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|My friends and I missed Dexter when it was initially being aired.  Now that we have discovered him, we plan time when we can watch each episode together. We then speculate about how the plot will evolve -- always trying to guess the ending of the season as well as the action of the next episode. Great fun!!
0307887960|5.0|My husband and I saw this on the Dr Oz show and my husband said after seeing what this was all about said, \\"I can do that.\\"  I ordered the book and we started the day it came.  My husband has lost 8 pounds and I have lost 6 pounds, in 6 days, on the Attack Phase and we are getting ready to start the Cruise Phase.  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to lose some weight.  I have tried so many diets and none have ever worked before. We both are feeling so much better.  Not quite where we want to be, but the boost this gave us has us both very excited.  Good Luck!
B001ED7C58|4.0|Even if you don't like the movie, this soundtrack has many great songs on it. I especially like 'Super massive black hole' (from the baseball scene), 'Decode' and 'I caught myself'. Plus 'Bella's lullabye' is simple yet powerful. The only weird song for me was 'Go all the Way'. I don't remember it from the movie, though it might have been there, and the lyrics don't match the themes of the 'Twilight' story. (A song about sex really has no place in a movie in which the characters don't have sex). I'm not saying it's a bad song (though it's not my favorite) but it doesn't seem right on this soundtrack.    I especially like this for driving because it has both upbeat and slow songs that cover many emotions. A great soundtrack to pick up (even if you're not a Twilight fan).
B003FMESLC|5.0|It's good toy, good quality, good looking. We had it not for too long so i can't say if it lasts. My daughter loves to sit there and somebody should push her.... while my son rides it.<br /><br />UPDATE: We do not like this toy at all... it's just staying outside and my daughter tries to ride it, but it is very hard for her witht his bike. it is also very uncomfortable to push it around. After having it for over a year i can say that i would not recommend it to my friends, and if i knew before i would return it.
B0021AEIUU|5.0|This is a classic gothic novel, written in the Victorian era in England. The external story is a tale of the mad scientist Dr Jekyll and his monsterous alter ego Mr Hyde. Which in itself is a great gothic novel to read.    For literary content: it's interesting to know that this novel was written shortly after Stevenson's friend, Oscar Wilde was imprisoned in Redding Gaol under the La Bouche Amendment. The La Bouche Amendment was a law passed in England which basically deemed homosexuality to be a crime.    There are many instances of homosexual 'code' within the novel and the public reaction to Mr Hyde in the book is symbolic of a Victorian's reactions to a homosexual - they react with anger, not fear.    There are also many other literary interpretations of this novel, but the time period it was written in and the historical facts do point towards it being a veiled homosexual novel from the Victorian era.    Much as many Gothic novels are instrinsically about sex and sexuality, in a time period where the subject was taboo, this novel is also a treasure trove of secret meanings from another age.

0316044938|3.0|This book was a real rough read for me as the subject matter is so unthinkable and disturbing.  I really had to push myself to get through it.  It's well written though, and the notions about how someone who has passed continues in the lives of those left behind were fascinating.  Grief, pain, and loss are all dealt with poignantly.  I'd definitely read more from Alice Sebold.
0756405890|5.0|There are like a hundred reviews on this site, so mine will likely never be read. This novel is a hybrid Robert E. Howard's fantasy work and Harry Potter. It's mature fiction, but it could pass as young adult because it's not as soap operatic as George R. R. Martin. Anyone who regularly reads fantasy or pulp fiction will immediately realize The Name of the Wind is a fresh breeze in a genre that is quickly becoming a mess of cliches and movie franchises. Rothfuss doesn't reinvent the wheel, but he surely puts a new spin on it.
030726999X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, just like I did the other two.  I am so sad that Mr. Larrson has died, I would have loved knowing how his characters matured.
1416955070|2.0|Ok, I literally just finished all 486 pages just now and I'm so irritated I can barely type!!! Let me start off by saying that I love supernatural books with good story lines and good plots and this one was recommended to me, so I gave it a shot. Once I got to the part about the scorpion, centipede, demon that talked I wasn't planning on continuing to read because that's not something I would normally be interested in. However, I found myself saying just one more chapter then the next chapter would come and say the same thing, until I was more than halfway through and could focus on the very intriguing plot and not the unimaginable weird looking creatures!    I found myself not particularly liking the main character Clary. I found her a little too young and naive for a book that would have been a lot more on the mature side, if she were a couple years older or had an older mindset at the beginning of the book. I know she has to mature throughout the book, but at some points she was all over the place and sometimes untreatable. However, I LOVED Jace and his unpredictable attitude. I love that Cassandra threw in Alec for the twist, and added just the right amount of something to the story. I don't know but when she was describing the characters I found Simon and Luke entirely to similar! I feel like Simon is Luke but 10 years younger!     The story line was good for the most part and something I enjoyed. I think it could have been cut a little bit shorter because it seemed to drag at times. I liked the unpredictability to not knowing whom to trust, and I found myself constantly guessing who was the good guys. I was pissed when Luke turned his back on Clary and her mom, but of course he ends up being the hero. I figured as soon as Hodge told her that her mom and Valentine were married that he would end up being her dad. We all knew Simon was in love and I truly felt bad for him because of course he is a good guy so I was really hoping that him and Isabelle would work out. I don't like the idea of flying motorcycles I thought that was too much and tried to skim through those pages as quickly as I could. Also I thought the hunt for the cup could have been way more interesting, I hated the pulling stuff out of artwork idea, it was stupid! There were some things that were extreme and hard to believe, but I think it was pretty well written and I enjoyed it for the most part.    However, lets get to the big effin elephant in the room. Why tease the readers with such a good chance of a love story and then rip it out from under us? WTF is that about? It honestly ruined the entire book for me. How are you going to have such an intriguing love interest (the hard to get bad boy and the shy good girl who has no idea what she's getting herself into [isn't that how all the great love stories start out]) and completely ruin it? I was into it, I was waiting for them to finally kiss then when they did he made her feel like crap, I was wanting more. I was wanting him to break his hard image and tell her he loves her, or maybe even leave her and let them meet again in the next book or even get with Simon until he wanted her. But brother and sister, really? That is the whole reason I'm writing this review, not something I normally do, because it just irritates me so badly. Then to top it all off she's all okay with totally being in love with her brother and making out with him, and then is like \\"oh lets go see our mom together\\" and \\"let me wrap my arms around you while we fly into the night\\" C'mon that's the most disgusting and unbelievable thing I've ever read. Maybe in the next book they find out different and end up together who knows, but I wont be reading the next book to find out because this completely ruined it for me!!! Sorry, I had to vent. All in all if you want to read a pretty interesting book with a HORRIBLE let down at the end well then this is the book for you!
B003L77GH4|5.0|For anyone who love the Twilight series, you have to watch this show!! It is full of drama,romance,action, and soo many sexy characters:) After I watched the first episode of the first season I was hooked and since bought the season and have watched it over and over. Can't wait to get the second season!!
B000K7VHLY|4.0|After Titanic, this was the movie that made me love Leonardo DiCaprio. The rest of the cast, except for John Leguizamo as Tybalt, did a very nice job-John was too over the top for me, Miriam Margolyes as the nurse was pretty funny, and Claire Danes was very cute as Juliet. The music fit the mood of the story very well. If you like Shakespeare's work, you may like this film as well. I saw BL's version of Moulin Rouge-which was good, but this is better. Now admittedly, the first ten minutes of this film may be hard to take for some, it seems more like a gangster shoot out sequence than WS, but oh well, those who don't have the urge to turn it off, the rest of the movie is very well done. How would Shakespeare feel about this film? Honestly, I don't know, my High School english teachers liked it, but they also liked the Farrelly brothers Kingpin, and I thought it was grossly stupid, so use your own judgment.
B00138F080|5.0|I discovered this group, incidentally enough, by hearing one of their songs (\\"Electric Feel\\") in an episode of \\"American Dad.\\" I was about the buy just that song when I decided to listen to a sample of \\"The Youth\\" and was like, I have to buy the whole album now!
1400052181|5.0|As a professor, I always think of how a book could be used for educating students. This book would be relevant to so many majors--health, nursiing, and medicine; psychology (child development, family psych, and social psych); sociology; biology and genetics; philosophy ( ethics); and even business.  I was so entranced that I kept updating my husband on the book's revelations.  This is a wonderfully written, deeply engaging story. My kudos to the author . . . Although an important story, her strength and integrity are what made this book possible.  Truly a timeless story.
B002H3EUAE|5.0|My wife and I just received this in the mail on Friday. I have read a lot of reviews about the quality and sound of the movie and my two cents worth is, yes you really cant tell a big difference in the quality but there is a difference. There is a little more depth in the blu-ray than on the regular dvd. I loved all the little trinkets that came with the blu-ray!!!!!! Some people complained that they were crappy and cheap, well what do you expect for something that costs less than $40. If you wanted high dollar memorabilia then maybe you should try an auction instead of a mass produced blu-ray tin!! All in all I love the blu-ray and the trinkets that came with it.
1400097029|3.0|John Banville has stated that he \\"tries to give his prose the kind of denseness and thickness that poetry has\\", and this is what he does. The descriptions are often very well done, but overall this book was not my cup of tea, and I was disappointed. The story seems to drag on and on, with nothing happening. A trip to the beach, in which nothing remarkable happens, seems to take 20 pages. The narrator comes off to me as overly educated and hopelessly introverted, so caught up in his own world and words that the characters of the story are at pains to get a word in edgewise. When the story does get moving along for a single slow, long mile, as, for example, it did when Max described meeting up with his daughter and going out to a restaurant, it was complex and enjoyable.<br /><br />I realize that my opinion is a minority opinion, and there are some--perhaps more sensitive to language than I am--who positively exhalt in this book. Some will see this as a high point for literature, while I simply disagree on a basic level. I need to be amused and impressed, while erudition, apt description, and long words alone simply do not do it for me. I suppose I want prose to be more extroverted with more action and dialogue. The prose seems to me to harken back to a former age, romantic, perhaps? Or previous? Some will embrance this old, aristocratic, philosophical sound with relish, but I could not shake the feeling that the language often did not fit the subject matter. (Some of the philosophical implications were quite good, deep, and interesting, and would provide ample resource for a thesis of some sort.) At its best, I found the book amusing, at its worst long winded. To be sure, there were moments when I did get lost in the descriptive prose that so many have spoken of, but I was always awakened by the desire to know what was going to happen next long before Banville was ready to deliver it. In a word, it wasn't my cup of tea. Then again, I'll never see a Booker, either.
0316548189|5.0|Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of reading Nelson Mandela's autobiography is the causal, peaceful, and conversational tone with which he documents his (anything but ordinary) life: the childhood, the early political and family struggles, the trial, his incarceration, and ultimately his role in the fight to end apartheid in South Africa. A powerful and a truly inspirational story - great read.
B004LZRRRE|1.0|A-Ha went to great lengths to produce a live DVD that was as good as a studio album, and this DVD just doesn't do it justice. First, the DVD does not contain the extras it's advertised as having: the documentary and photo gallery. Both are missing from the DVD. Second, the quality of the DVD is non-existent. My first DVD stopped playing half way through the concert. So I returned the item for a replacement. Bad idea! The second DVD is even worse. It doesn't even make it through the first song before the picture becomes pixilated, and then the DVD stops playing altogether. And you can't get around it by choosing another track from the menu, because none of them will play. I hear the Blue Ray disk is fantastic, so if you're considering purchasing the final concert, you may want to skip the DVD and pay for the Blue Ray disk. Too bad the manufacturer has messed the DVD up so badly. I'm giving this one star because it is A-Ha and the CDs are still good, but the quality of the DVD doesn't even deserve that.
0316056863|5.0|Wonderful book - had me hysterically laughing at her childhood stories, intrigued about her experience in television, and touched about her endearing words regarding her daughter.

We have watched the Blu-Ray version of Country Strong at least 10 times in our home.  I am sure there was some doctoring to the voices of the celebrities, but even knowing some of the shortfalls, the music will keep you coming back again and again.  If you like country this is worth a look.

0375842209|5.0|This book is so wonderfully written and it made me feel as though I were living right there in it's pages. It isn't the sort of book that leaves you feeling excited and happy. It is the sort of book that likes to creep back into your thoughts from time to time, when you aren't expecting it. It is the sort of book that makes you take a closer look at the world around you, your life and the life of others. I think it was very clever of the author to use Death as the narrator. It took a look at the events from an entirely unique perspective.    I've read a lot about the holocaust as it's a subject that has been written about extensively. It's always so unbelievable to me that it actually happened, though we know it certainly did. This book, somehow, made it more personal to me. It was like standing on top of a mountain and looking at the town below through a pair of binoculars. It gave me a closer and more intimate look at a small slice of the events. I saw a much more intimate picture of the people and what they endured. So the book is quite unforgettable and I am sure that it will continue to creep back into my thoughts on a continuous basis.    Don't think of this as \\"just another book about the holocaust.\\" It's more, much more than that.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I looked fwd to doing these exercises with my wife. I opened and tried the DVD the day it came in the mail.  Wow, a super workout, even at level 1.  And Jillian's comments and encouragement were not too bad.  Immediately after the workout I was pretty trashed, but in a good way, and was recovered in a few hours.  Even that good-kind-of-sore the next day.    Now day 3 (one off for rest), and I eagerly wanted to start my 20 min workout. But, NO.    I'm forced to wait thru 5 min of \\"Lionsgate\\" produced, and then Jillian hyping the program that I've already bought.   Then wait for more: the slowly scrolling \\"precautions on beginning an exercise program\\".   No way to FFwd thru, or to skip to \\"Disk Menu\\".  Hey folks (in production), this is not a movie; I want to do this every day or two, without delay.    I also found Jillian's encouragement (\\"no shame here, ladies\\"), a little tiresome on day two. So will not stick around for day 10 or Day 20.    You can suppress \\"Jillian's instructions\\", and leave on the music, but then I'd have to constantly look at the DVD rather than be in proper position.    I'd suggest they offer a \\"terse talk\\" option.    BTW, when you register at her site, you can get THIS DVD, and another DVD, AND a month 'subscription', for $14.95. So she has marketing channel confusion, too -- competing with her distributors.    Oh, well, on to Jackie Warner.
B00335EQ0E|3.0|Disney had an affinity for Alice novels going back to his initial years in the industry with Alice and Cartoonland. He attempted to make a live-action version with Mary Pickford in 1933 while affiliated with United Artists though its more than obvious that it was not commercially viable firstly because of Paramount's adaption secondly has to with that its not fathomable for that type of adaption to have the same impact as Snow White which shaped the family film market as we know it today, contrary to what people might have previously thought however is that Disney's films did have psychological undertones not akin to what would be seen in a children's movie.    Alice in Wonderland seems to be Walt's original labor of love gone awry due to conflicting interests in other endeavors such as building up Disneyland or advocating for the space program to counter the Russians Alice among other films took second seat. Again Walt is quite the multi-tasker in the 1950's that not every film is to up to par with what he had previously established. Being invested in so many other endeavors inhibits Walt to invest at the film at task since he is so focused on other endeavors this is exactly what sabatoged a good bulk of his movies.     One of the redeeming qualities is Mary Blair's conceptual influence on the film. However it doesn't seem to have much else artistically or stylistically going for it. Its episodic, serialized like many other previous Disney endeavors however in many cases the atmosphere itself seems the same throughout. The environment doesn't really change because it is inherent of Mary Blair's influence, while talented it is overly dependent on her skill. The other thing to take into consideration is our heroines naivety which makes many of the bi-polar villains in this film such as the Queen of Hearts and Mad Hatter unwilling to cope. She never really shows remorse because personality is not effective and she acts as if she has no muscles or any actual sincere emotions, only Milt Kahl and Marc Davis animate her effectively again it seems that there are conflicting interests to focus on other things instead of this film so there is little invest to make this project work. Also again when it comes to coming up short on personality this is a contradiction of the company who established personality in the early to mid-thirties when they were technologically building up their company.

1594202842|5.0|After reading the book, I feel like the author, Amy Chua, did a fantastic job on narrating her Chinese approach of educating her two daughters.  I think the reason that this book received so many negatives reviews and became a controversial topic in America over the past couple months is b/c ppl took the book the wrong way.  Just b/c Amy forced and pushed her two daughters extremely hard to play instruments, instead of letting her two daughters to make their own choices doesn't necessarily make Tiger Mom is a horrible book.     In the American society, our culture emphasizes strongly on individuality and freedom.  One of the things that Americans always have in mind is that it is my life, i will live my life the way that i imagined; whether it is practice violin for 5 hrs each day or play video games 8 hrs each day.  I do everything in life simply b/c i want to it, not b/c i have or obligated to do it.  For this reason, we see that Nobel prize winners are often from america or european countries, instead of place like China. On the other hand, in today's america, we are also seeing an overwhelmingly # of ppl who rely on calculator to do simple arithmetic, dropping out of school at a young age and young teenage girls become pregnant while they are still in hs or even middle school.  When it comes to education, i don't think there is a wrong or right way of educating kids, because both educating method (Chinese and American) have its pros and cons.  Ultimately, it is up to the parents to decide how am I going to educate my kids.  In Amy's book, she basically argues that the Chinese way of educating children is the way to go when it comes to educating kids, because it brings discipline, high academic performance, respect and ultimately a brighter future to the kids.  And i think in her 200+ pgs book, she did an excellent job explaining her reasons and also openly talked about the conflicts that she had with her younger daughter, lulu.   For that reason, I am giving thebook a 5 star.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I read many Amazon reviews before buying this, but they didn't prepare me for how it felt in my hand.  Wow.  I didn't think that it might be too heavy duty for EDC.  Also, since purchasing, I decided I'm not confident in my ability to maintain a non-stainless steel blade in the wild.  Fortunately for me, I showed another blade-loving friend of mine this knife and he immediately expressed an interest in buying it from me.  This saved me the trouble of getting a return.  I think I'm going to buy a Fallkniven F1 for EDC and a separate wood chopping/cutting device (parang or hatchet).    The price is amazing for such a durable survival knife made in the USA!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The director's cut was great because it eliminated all the confusion of the theatrical release. I had seen it on TV but much of it didn't make sense especially the attack where the uncle is mentioned plus Sibella's role, etc. I liked the extras which gave an insight into how Scott worked and also lots of detail on the costumes and how the digital additions were done. A couple to minuses were that Scott kept talking about what would have happened in North Africa (where he shot the film) and not in Jerusalem which is not in North Africa. Also I think there was a mistake in the dialogue when the patriarch of Jerusalem says the bodies can't be burned: Bodies that are burned cannot be resurrected until Judgement Day. All bodies cannot be resurrected until Judgement Day. Believe this should have read \\"cannot be resurrected on Judgement Day.\\"

B003UBTX72|5.0|The thing I like most about this type of book are the tasty nuggets you're treated to that wouldn't normally come out in a traditional interview or biography. For example, the story about the scruffy little terrier that found it's way into Keef's dressing room and became adopted. We get to learn that Keith talks to his dogs, constantly, because they listen. Quite a bit of time is spent on the riff with Mick and drugs, as can be expected. It's the nuggets that kept me pressing the Next arrow on my Kindle.

I wasn't a huge Twilight fan even though it was inspired by that, but to me combining Stevie's voice with the darkness and mystery of vampires is a winner! She has really played to her strengths on this album as a whole too, and so far I think the videos and images from the album are perfect. She has always had this whole witch image that people are intrigued with so it seems ideal to play that up. As she has said, she sees herself more as Glenda, and the cover is that image: Stevie as Glenda.<br />The other standout tracks to me are Secret Love and Annabelle Lee. I think the collaboration with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics is brilliant and it's great to see him in the videos too. Go buy the album!

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is an intense workout. I have definitely seen results, in toning my muscles, as I just moved to Level 2. I am at a weight loss plateau and this seems to help just a bit as long as I eat extremely cautiously in conjunction. Since it is a 20 minute workout, I can see why Jillian doesn't allow a water break, but due to it's intensity, it is impossible not to stop (and miss some exercise) in order to hydrate. When doing this workout, I have to give myself a lot of positive self talk, as it is extremely intense, and Jillian lacks in this department. I am hoping to figure out how to turn off her voice next go around. She is pretty rough around the edges and is the only thing about this video I wish I could change.

B00521LT8O|3.0|They tie in the series arc with the doctor doing a full body scan of Amy Pond with the positive/negative result, as well as the woman looking through the slit in the door.    Never a fan of multiple part episodes.   I wish they'd simply show them as a longer episode.   This is the typical doppelganger (ganger for short) show.   Everyone wants to kill their counterpart, which is typical of doppelgangers.   Not sure how the Doctor got duplicated, because he wasn't in their machine, but he did touch the liquid in the pool.  They are unable to reach the Tardis because it's mostly submerged in a pool of acid.   Rory plays a bigger part in this episode, bonding with one of the gangers.   All pretty confusing, and I expect it to be resolved in the conclusion.    To top this off, the episode will not queue to download.   Customer service said that it was a mistake with Doctor Who episodes, and it would have to be sent back to the studio (factory??) for fixing.  This glitch started for some members with episode 4, and seems to be becoming more wide spread instead of getting fixed. My previous episodes still queue to download, but not this episode.   I think a partial refund is in order since the episode will not queue to Tivo.    5/25/11 - Episode now downloads to TV    5/29/11 - No episode this week.   Not only do we have a to be continued, do we have a hiatus too?   Why the break for the holiday weekend?
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I'm not a ballet fan, but I've always been mesmerized by the signature melody (Dance of the Swans) of SWAN LAKE that I probably first heard as a wee lad viewing the original DRACULA (with Bela Lugosi) on TV. I didn't--and actually still don't--understand why the theme was used in the DRACULA opening credits. Of course it's totally logical in THE BLACK SWAN. In addition to this, I missed the opening credits & didn't know who the director was, or who Natalie Portman was--OR that Barbara Hershey & Winona Ryder (both favorites of mine) was even in the movie. In other words, I was a sort of \\"virgin\\" for the first screening. If this isn't enough, I had no idea BLACK SWAN was a horror movie. I thought it was just about artistic rivalry--like THE RED SHOES or THE TURNING POINT.<br /><br />If I had been aware that Darren Aranofsky was the director, a lot of things would have fallen in place sooner. I previously reviewed Aranofsky \\"Pi\\" & pretty much gave it a rave review. Certain elements of the low budget production were mirrored in this upscale, technically proficient film.<br /><br />The plight of Natalie Portman's character is actually not so unique--just think of all the \\"Stars\\" who have been ground into dust in the performing arts milieu, particularly in the United States. Judy Garland was worked to death and many others (like Michael Jackson) were drugged to death. In this regard I think actor Vincent Cassel got his character just right. Push, push, and push. Always needing to keep the financial donors on his side, egomaniacal, often indifferent to the pain his artists were experiencing--a knave with genius. I've always thought that ballet was basically sadomasochistic & Cassel plays the perfect sadist. In the character's defense, he pushes his Swan Queen to the edge in order to bring out the aggression & seductiveness of her Black Swan role.<br /><br />I felt that all the main actors were excellent. One reviewer faulted Portman's dancing--I thought she was pretty darn good all things considered. I mean you can't have everything (most of the time). She is an actress & does a great job revealing the dancer's morbid insecurities & the pressure that is assaulting her from all corners. Her portrayal of the Black Swan at the end is astonishing. Here we see the artistically integrated person, the girl transformed into a woman. Unfortunately for her it comes too late. Portman is stunningly gorgeous in this scene.<br /><br />This is one of the best horror movies I've seen. It will be utterly fascinating to see what Aranofsky has next for his growing audience. THE BLACK SWAN proved that he is a really BIG player & force to be reckoned.. I mean you can't have everything (most of the time).

B0034G4OUY|2.0|The Best Straight-up Action Film of the Year. As stated on the front of the Blu-ray. Make no mistake I am a huge fan of the Rock, Dwayne Johnson. I've pretty well watched everything he's done that are movies. He's in the top 3 of my favorite action stars. Sadly, he was also in this movie.    I am reviewing both the movie and the Blu-Ray in this and any other review I do here. I paid for it and I want my money's worth. I definitely did not get it here because I paid full price. This is at best a 2/$20 deal.    THE MOVIE: This was a director's attempt, in my opinion, of trying to capture a cross between something like Kill Bill and Fast and Furious but with a more serious edge. FAIL.    The Rock played a quiet part in this and that is just not the Rock's style. Billy-Bob Thorton however played his part as he always does, extremely well. There is something magical about the guy, reminds me of Brando for some reason. Like Brando I don't go out of my way to see his movies but seem to enjoy watching anything he ends up in that I am watching. The rest of the cast was ok. Sadly though the movie failed miserably in capturing what I believe the director was going for and that is what makes it watchable only once. (RATING: 2/5)    THE BLU-RAY EXTRAS: There were two decent mini-documentaries on the Blu-Ray. A behind the scenes \\"Criminal and Cops: The Case of FASTER\\" which was ok. Seemed kind of a normal \\"He was great...she was great...it was an awsome experience.\\" George Tillman who Directed the film offered some interesting commentary. The same can be said for the Weapons and Wheels Featurette.    Deleted Scenes and Alternate Ending were both very good and personally I preferred the Alternate Ending. I also would have liked to have seen the deleted scenes in the movie.     The Animatics was also cool to watch but nothing over and above. I could take it or leave it. (Extras RATING: 3/5)    FINAL THOUGHTS: I liked the concept of the movie. I had a feeling of where the Director wanted to take it. Unfortunately it was like watching a talented athlete give a half-ass performance. You expect to see something wicked take place and it just keeps falling short. That's how I walked away from this.      RATING: 2/5 stars. Why? Because I can't say I would watch this again. As mentioned I am a big fan of the Rock, love watching his movies but because I can honestly say this is not likely to be one I will watch again, 2 stars. The director has potential he just needs to try again.

B003PIUBZS|4.0|UPDATED BELOW!    The dialogue will make you groan, as will the cheesy direction. You will discover this in one of the series' very first scenes. It begins in a room crowded with scantily dressed men. WWF types, all of them, except for the wise old man character, who calls for silence by barking, \\"Hold you f'ing tongues.\\" He didn't actually resort to an apostrophe. As the scene unfolds, our hero walks unimpeded through the crowd of scantily clad WWF types to the front of the room. So immediately we know, \\"Oh, he must be the main character.\\" Everyone is reacting to an emissary/warmonger from Rome who is trying to convince the gathering -- apparently, they're the men of some village -- to join with Rome in a fight against some barbarians. During the emissary's pitch, the men of the village break out into another boisterous uproar. In a soft voice, our hero asks: \\"To what end?\\" Louder, angrier: \\"To what end?\\" Silence.    Emissary (smug expression, grabs belt): \\"Victory.\\"    Hero: \\"And how is it to be measured? The Gedai have raided our village in the past ...\\"    (WWF types break out in an uproar: \\"Yeah!\\")    Hero: \\"Raped our women!'    (Crowd, louder this time: \\"Yeah!\\")    Hero: \\"Killed our children ...\\"    (Crowd is even louder with the same remarks of agreement)    Eventually, the wise old man character speaks up again: \\"Our hero speaks out of turn yet the truth falls from his mouth.\\"    Much later, in a whole 'nother scene, our hero is complaining to the best-friend character about the emissary. \\"The pompous, arrogant boy-lover all but called us liars!\\" The best-friend character asks why he thinks that. Our hero explains himself, and the best-friend character asks, \\"No, no. About the boys, how do you know he favors them?\\"    If the cheesy dialogue and directorial clues over-dramatizing almost every scene aren't enough, well, the CG is really awful, too.    So you're gonna be watching this, wondering why Amazon customers rate the show so highly when it's just plainawful, when the answer comes in all its glory: Full-frontal nudity, soft-core sex-scenes, sizzling bodies.    It's true, sex sells, and it's really all this show has going for it.    I'm giving Spartacus two stars instead of just one because, well, the nudity is pretty good.    Update: I have changed my rating to four stars. The formulaic story-telling remains, but as the series progresses the dialogue improves and the show begins to focus on the gladiators. There are gruesome scenes in the arena, and they are superbly choreographed. \\"Spartacus\\" just may be the most action-packed violence on TV, except during the NFL season.    Oh, and the beautifully waxed, full-frontal male nudes are no longer jarring.

B002NPY7FE|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book. Most movies made from popular books take too many liberties with the acutal story in order to get it on film and maintain an audience. Tough changes were made here also I enjoyed the movie overall. It took a second viewing to accept the ending in the movie which drastically changed from the book. Both are enjoyable to read or view and would reccomend them to anyone who enjoys horror and Stephen King!

B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is highly entertaining.  The sidekicks are such a highlight to the overall movie...funny stuff...I think it's kind of sad and pathetic when some of  the posters/reviewers here break this thing down to social issues..really??  How sad that some just can't enjoy this for what it is..a cartoon about a fairy tale!  Ever read the REAL fairytales?  Life isn't always roses and crumpets...  Great movie, very well done, and watchable many times over, highly recommended.  Loved it!!!!!
B001993Y3G|5.0|This story may not be true to the folklore and previous written history of Robin Hood, but compared to many that I have viewed, the story is entertaining, action packed and well acted. Even some newer, more recent versions of this character, (Robin Hood) played by well known and talented actors do not beat this version.  This is a well made action movie with some laughs and a good overall story line to catch the interest of many age groups and interests.
B002ZG983M|5.0|\\"Kick Ass\\" is a spoof of superhero movies, but a very affectionate spoof.    It's got a shocking amount of blood, shocking language, and at least one actor that verges on child-porn, at least in the eyes of some.    But it's great.    Very well written, has interesting characters (even the villains, who are cliches, are interesting), and a wildly skewed take on everything from teen nerdiness to who's really the baddest ass.    And of course, best of all, the baddest of the very badasses is a skinny little 10-year-old girl with a purple wig.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This and other TV series of it's kind are rarely historically accurate. But hopefully, if one takes an interest in this subject, then comes the \\"real\\" study of this historical subject. However,keep in mind that written history can sometimes be just as inaccurate as this kind of visual historical drama.  Having said that, I have a question:  Is this complete series the same as that that appeared on HBO?  I've seen more expensive versions that boast themselves to be \\"UNCUT.\\"  Is this $90 version uncut?
0515142247|4.0|I just finished the book and I enjoyed it so much.  From beginning to end this book was so hard to put down.<br /><br />I won't go into the synopsis, but this book definately had you wondering how it was all going to be resolved, how was Jack getting out of this one. Lee Child does a wonderful job writting this story.  He makes you feel like you right there with Jack every step of the way, from riding in the back of a hot truck, to feelings of claustorphobia.  What truly amazes me is the obvious amount of work and research that goes into writing the books.<br /><br />If you haven't checked out one of Lee Child's series, don't delay.  I don't think you'll be disappointed<br /><br />Stats:<br />Ebook Page #: 356<br />Narration: 3rd Person
0525422943|4.0|Following the haunting ending of If I Stay, Where She Went is told entirely from now-21-year-old Adam's point-of-view. This change fits perfectly with where the characters - Adam and Mia - are in their lives after the events of If I Stay. Where She Went certainly held my attention and the characters are as well-drawn and fully realized as the first book. Mia and Adam's mutual hurt and love come across as very genuine. Gayle Forman has a gift for getting into the point-of-view character's head and expressing their emotions in heart-wrenching detail. Her writing is as lyrically lovely and bold as it was in If I Stay, but this time imbued with all of Adam's anxiety and self-deprecating bitterness. The musical influences, including Adam's emotionally raw lyrics, are intrinsic to the story and really add depth to his character. One of my favourite aspects of Where She Went is that it examines the grief of a person who is not the most closely related to the deceased, showing the spore effect of death.    Despite being beautifully written, I feel as if Where She Went lacks some of the emotional impact of If I Stay. Mia's story just seemed so immediate and the uncertainty of whether she would chose to stay or go haunted the story, while parts of the sequel felt somewhat predictable. The fact that Adam is a super-famous, tabloid-fodder rock star, Mia is well-known in the cellist world, and even her best friend Kim is taking photos for National Geographic also lends a sense of surrealism to the story; consequently, it loses some of the realism that, for example, made Mia's middle-class family so endearing in the first book.    Nevertheless, Where She Went is a must-read for fans of the first book. Though not necessarily lighter than If I Stay, it is more romance-focused and cathartic in its examination of Adam's pent-up emotions and choices.
1600108512|3.0|For the most part, this graphic novel version of the story covers the same ground as the film. The look of the characters very clearly was inspired by the film version as well. The small additions to the plot in some places, and the subtractions (like the tree that freaked people out the most in the movie), made me even more curious to read the original novel. That is definitely a thing I need to do someday.<br /><br />The graphic novel is definitely pretty and oh so colorful. However, its brevity means that a few things have to be cut. Much of the trimming took place in the latter half of the tale, making it rather confusing and, did I not know the story, I likely would have been confused by much of the time spent in King Haggard's castle.
0439023521|4.0|I first heard about this book about 6 months ago, and didn't want to read it due to all the hype about it- I figured it was the Twilight Saga all over again. My friend lent it to me yesterday after having to read it for her sci-fi lit class, and I finally finished it today. I didn't think that it would be so rivetting, but it is!! I felt like I was standing behind Katniss' shoulder through the whole book, the imagery is so vivid! If you have the oppertunity to read it, do it. I hesitate advising you to buy it, but I'm definitely going to order the next 2 right now :)
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|This movie is a train wreck. The only one who can carry a tune is the actress that plays the daughter. I don't know how this made it to the public, anyone watching the dailies could have told you it stinks. The story was terrible, the camera work was worse & the actors except where noted above cannot carry a tune. It was like watching 2 hours of Jr. high bad music. I can't figure out why so many people love this movie. I'd rather have a toothache than watch it again!
B004VD3PE0|5.0|If I Stay was a very powerful read. In fact I'm still reeling about it actually. If I could sum this book up in one word it would be: Heartbreaking.<br /><br />If- If I Stay was a movie, it would be in the same class as P.S. I Love You. Tear-jerker all the way. The first time I saw P.S. I Love You, I sobbed- NO, no cried... SOBBED- weeped uncontrollably until the hubby finally came upstairs and suggested it was time for a tiny break.. Yes, I'm a complete train wreck of emotional instability.<br /><br />If I Stay was like that. It touched me so deeply that I literally had to take 'breaks' from reading it!<br /><br />I can't even remember how long its been since I've cried and cried like this through a book! At the end there was a hallow ache in my chest... *shaky sigh* Don't cry thinking about her baby brother! Don't do it Ashley!!<br /><br />I only have one query... The blurb on the front says,<br />\\"Will appeal to fans of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight.\\"<br /><br />Now this blurb had nothing at all to do with why I read this book, I actually didn't even notice it until halfway through reading it so it totally doesn't matter... But, If I Stay was absolutely NOTHING like Twilight in any way, shape or form. *confused Brunette* Can someone clarify this for me?
B002BSHXJA|2.0|even though I got it for $99 I was sceptical that it was worth the price- its more then worth it. It doesnt have abbey road or let it be =just found that out. the word mono scared me off- but this is HD 3-D sound so much better then the streo remasters.  there is a big differance in listening to these on Dolby II and DTS its hard to hear the differance from the streo or the remastered stero oh yea 2 stars because its the lest amount choosen if its like your selfish purchases of the month its at least not wasted.I dont know if its worth sacrificing for alternatevly. But I am really enjoying it. Im listening to Sgt pepper and I have to say Im enjoying it more then I did the recent remaster the benifit of mR kite sounds actually much better then the other versions, I got it for $99 at Best buy today Im kinda cheep but I really like this version of Sgt pepper Im listening to it on Dobly but I think when its done I will listen to it again on DTS, But its really good in my stupid opinion. In fact I think I may perfer this version its mono but it sure sounds more 3-d then you would think. it just seems the individual insterments are sepeate and distinct more then the stero versions- and for that matter the singing seems clearer, I gues that would sum it up its kinda like putting your glasses on- you could see it before but this is clear and sharp. if I had 2 discs I would recomend because the sound differance is so clear- and awesome it would be Sgt. pepper (so far) nad Fear of music talking heads in 5.1,, can you tell im saying buy this if you are on the fence I didnt feel the sound differance on the remasters was worth the price- but I just put on revolver and really the sound differance is worth the price if thats what your wondering about. So far these sound vastely better then the streao versions and if you change from Dolby to DTS its like two new versions so that makes it even better- Wow Eloner rigby might sound even better here then it does on the Love DVD.but ifyou dont think its worth it skip it. My feeling is I am soo glad I bought this it sounds so good so if your after that type of feeling you got it here. Im listening to the white album which I think was recorded for streo but this relly sounds better, I can say that the mono box sounds deeper Softer- and DirtyerLike nice soft black dirt thathas some worms in it. I just burned the white album onto 1 disc so I have listened to it recently but this version made me feel like I hvent heard it before Somehow the jet engines and the guitair are so sperate back in the USSR seems  like I never heard it before.Really you guys who gave it 5 stars should have just come out and said its vastely superiour to the steo versions, maybe just me butits that good to me. the way the background volcos float in dear prudence the stream in revolver Im just surprised that nobody sseemed to really say how great these versions sound  As to the sound it is sweet and clear-you can almost see the string viberating on the guitair now excuse me for Im going to bunalow bill asnd rocky racoon right here in my living room. while my guitair gently--mmm in four days I had more people read this becasue I GAVE IT 2 STARS THEN i bet read the hundreds of 5 star reviews- im only trying to get me some sleep christ you know it aint easy. Oh by the Weigh it doesnt have abby road or let it be,nobody told me- Im telling you.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis writes in a flowing yet detailed style.  He effortlessly flows from a gripping story about the  individuals who foresaw the crash (the trees) to an educational discussion about the general nuts and bolts about the subprime mortgage bond market (the forest).      I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how titans of Wall Street brought the entire financial world to its knees -- though Mr. Lewis leaves it open to debate whether they did so knowingly or through the gross negligence of a blind-faith belief in the decisions of underpaid employees at ratings agencies.
1416585710|2.0|It amazes me what Stephen King can get away with some times.  Make no mistake, King is an amazing writer and has written some of America's best horror novels.  Here however, he buries a possible good story under four hundred pages of near indecipherable time/reality jumps with newly created words that do nothing for the reader or story.  I was so disappointed by this novel.  The usual King creepiness is there only sporadically the general plot was all over the place.  Overall, this is just a minor speed bump for King but should be skipped unless you are King fanatic.

B003CIG7AE|5.0|BAND OF HORSES - INFINITE ARMS  Band Of Horses have come a long way in the last seven years or so. Formed circa 2004 in Seattle by South Carolina native Ben Bridwell and his friend Mat Brooke , early promise saw them land a deal with that fine city's most famous label Sub Pop.  Two albums, \\"Everything All The Time\\" and \\"Cease To Begin\\" followed fairly quickly (Brooke left after the former and formed his own band Grand Archives) and some amazing live shows helped cement their reputation. Along the way they also found time to gather up a pretty fanatical group of followers. I well remember my first introduction to the band when i saw them on TV performing live at the Glastonbury festival, it was an amazing show but what also caught my attention was the crowd, my jaw dropped when the BBC cameras panned 'round to reveal punters dancing along merrily with large papier-mâché horses heads on ! It was a surreal sight and i've pretty much been hooked ever since.   There have been a good few changes since then and band mates have come and gone along the way, Ben Bridwell being the only remaining founder member. At the moment the current line-up seems pretty solid and they've also re-located operations back to South Carolina and signed to Columbia Records for their third album \\"Infinite Arms\\", an outstanding release which was not only a firm contender for 2010's Album Of The Year crown but was also Grammy nominated. It lost out to \\"Brothers\\" by The Black Keys, another fine album. But that's for another day, for now we concentrate on the matter at hand - \\"Infinite Arms\\".    On the first few plays, what leaps out at you are the influences. The band wear theirs proudly on their sleeves and there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever, especially when you take them and mould them into something fresh , new and exciting. What it all adds up to is a very modern take on what can really only be described as Americana, indeed it's as close as anyone has come to that mythical \\"Cosmic American Music'\\" as envisioned by Gram Parsons all those years ago. That's a weighty term but it's one which Band Of Horses bear with ease.  For me anyway, there are strong echoes here of the likes of The Band, The Beach Boys (Brother Records period) and Neil Young/Crazy Horse. Also, musically, there's a delicious cross-pollination of styles and indeed genres going on here : Rock, Folk, Power- Pop and, maybe best of all, a healthy dollop of Country on top. Sweet melodies, lush arrangements and love-lorn vocals abound, it all adds up to something special indeed.  Lyrically it's crafty as well, fragments, gentle-nudges in the direction of the tale for the most part. Often, the listener gets just an idea of what's happening and is left to piece it together, fill in the blanks on their own. This is a big part of what makes the record intriguing and  keeps you coming back to it.    The overall excellence makes it hard to select highlights but i'm fond of these ones:  Bluebeard / exquisite harmonies and backing vocals are the making of this track, it's almost a tribute to \\"Sunflower\\" -era Beach Boys. The end section is flawless and makes a great song even better.  Evening Kitchen / A sparse folky number, gorgeous effort with a wonderful double vocal and an infectious guitar hook.  Laredo / This one's very much in Crazy Horse mode, it fairly struts along, catchy as hell and a real contender for best track on the album.  Older / This is a beauty. Written and sung by keyboard player Ryan Monroe, it's laid-back number, sounding somewhat like a mellow Flying Burritto Brothers if they had Carl Wilson making a cameo appearance on the mic ! Utterly sublime.  NW Apartment / ferocious, driving guitar on this, pounding drums and lyrical postcards from various locations.    Although the album is a real team effort by the band it would be remiss not to mention the immense input of Ben Bridwell, he's the lead singer and main songwriter and he turns in a superb showing on this one, he's getting better with each release and if that keeps up the next album will be mind-blowing.    It all sounds thoroughly modern and bang up to date due to the excellent production but also, firmly rooted in the past, there's a heart to this music that can mainly be found in ancient tradition, there's also timeless music, expansive and wide-reaching.  Americana in it's very best form.
B004M18AX2|5.0|I really like the new CD alot,all the songs sound great the music is really cool also. I have been a fan of Britneys Spears music from the beginnging,I have all her CD's collected.If your a fan of her music you should have this CD in your collection.
B0002S947K|5.0|Another new artist I just enjoy SO much. Thanks to FM station WXPN in Philly (88.5 or 104.9 in Allentown)for turning me on to new music. Life is too short for top 40!
0440423023|2.0|a much respected friend praised the jack reacher books up and down so i found a copy of THE HARD WAY at a used book store and decided to give it a try.  it took 200 pages into the book before the plot picked up.  jack reacher's character is well developed, but the story line started out so darn slowly.  i will give lee child another chance in hopes that my first book choice was a weaker choice.  two more used lee child books await...
B0037QGS0K|1.0|It's difficult to know where to begin in critiquing this movie.  Perhaps its most glaring failing is its predictability.  It's a \\"thriller\\" that is completely lacking in suspense because the major plot twist is telegraphed within the first fifteen of the movie and painfully made increasingly obvious as the plot plods along.<br /><br />And it does plod along, at a glacial pace that increasingly made me want to reach for the fast-forward button.  The cinematography and lighting are polished and intriguing, but the director is a little too in-love with them, and they become tedious after a while.<br /><br />All of this could be forgiven if the characters were well-developed, but they are not.  At best, they are cardboard-caricatures placed in an unusual situation.  Considering the caliber of the actors, I can only assume that the fault lies with the script (the dialogue is spartan and unimaginative) and the director, who never really seems to want us to get to know them.<br /><br />Even the brief, but explicit, sex scene between Seyfriend and Moore is not enough to gain this movie a second star.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|No Direction Home the film made by Martin Scorcese on Bob Dylan is a worthwhile documentary on Dylan’s life. Part 1 (late 50s-’63)describes his early years in Hibbing Minnesota.The kind of influences on the radio and in music. Bob gives from the perspective of weary-eyed wisdom the kind of place Hibbing was,the cold winters,the helping out now and again in his dad’s hardware store,the monotony of the life,the average ness of Bob’s attempts at music-making. He describes his two girlfriends with their exotic names, and his attempts to woo them with his music. Dylan felt the need to get away as far as possible from his hometown. He learned as a musical expeditionary to steal a collector’s records of folk and popular music, absorb all influences, develop a back story which is closer to mythology of where he’d been, how he developed, what he’d done. He returned 2 months later to show what he’d learned..  Friends who knew him are quoted. Suzie Rotolo, David Van Ronk, Liam Clancy. The Greenwich Village years. His early process of absorbing everything Woody Guthrie had done, his way of telling stories and his left wing sense of injustice. Dylan absorbed the way other musicians performed, the best ones had a certain look in their eyes. He donned new identities, had a Charlie Chaplin quality. Later Joan Baez loved his songs, found out about him and sung at concerts with him or introduced him(she being then more famous). They loved each other, but Dylan reacted vs. being adopted by the left -wing protest movement(of which Baez was a part), and his genius threw off the shackles of the topical songs he sung, moved to a more internal muse in songs like Hey Mr Tambourine Man and The Chimes of Freedom. He severed his links with Baez , leaving her with a wounded love she never got over. She saw all the new electric phase as decadent, but she reflects now he didn’t want to go down one tunnel, he was his own man, with a choice of many roads. She acknowledges his genius.  Liam Clancy remembers being irritated by his presence, always hanging around, having no definite identity. But after seeing him at Newport Folk Festival in 1963, realized he was a shamanic receiver for his generation, picking up all the influences, expressing what everybody thought. We get the decisive break with his folk fans at Newport in 1965 when he ‘went electric’ in a group with Al Kooper and Paul Butterfield. Pete Seeger, one the idols of his folk music, wanted to cut the cables, due to the noisiness of the sound when Dylan played for 15 minutes. All the time the historical context (with the background of JFK and Martin Luther King) feeds into the music-making. ‘Like a Rolling Stone’ seems to symbolise the break between his music and politics, almost a put-down of the former fans/non musical journalists and it’s played several times in the film. Dylan seems to be unaware of the source of his song-writing or its meaning, he typed away on his type-writer, not sure if he was producing a novel, play or song. Dylan is shown bemused at press conferences. &#34;I'm a song and dance man&#34;.  Ginsberg expresses something which had to change when he shifted over to electric. In his singing says Ginsberg, he `had found a way for all his consciousness and intelligence to be focussed on his breath'. That connection would become broken when he played electric guitar. The organic quality, the magnetic hold with his audience would become lost. The group played loud, Dylan shouted over the guitars. Mr Tambourine Man was his break away from public manipulation into inner worlds. He learned from The Byrds how it could be done and he learned from the Beatles, that pop and rock music were the future. He injected real intelligence into pop lyrics. He shifted for a while into country music after his motor-cycle crash rest period(where Part 2 ends).  Dylan gives sober commentaries looking back on his elusive, mercurial youth. He's very clear-eyed and matter-of-fact.For instance: &#34;I had a perspective on the booing...because you can kill somebody with kindness.&#34; We have had his Chronicles I, which gives a literary take on the period covered here. Scorsese has crafted a seamless mesh of documentary footage, concert out-takes, history(Kennedy, King,The Cold War,early singers ,Hibbing footage),interviews with those who were there at the start, Van Ronk, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, producers, Al Kooper, Cash, Neuwerth, The Band. There is a gap in what made him world famous. It's hinted at-as with The Beatles-the vacuum left after Kennedy's death , also the incredible changes going on with the baby-boomers, the space race, Vietnam, colour TV, post-war leisure and wealth. Part 2(1963-66) gives a series of takes from concert footage, especially In England, including the famous one where he’s called ‘Judas’ and shouts at the Band to’ play it f……… loud’. He usually played an acoustic set followed by an electric set. The diehard fans asked for Dylan to stay as he was. Dylan: &#34;As a performer, you can never say you've arrived. You've always got to be moving on.&#34;   Dylan himself remains an enigma,always moving, unable to be pinned down, avoiding definitions or analysis, yet curiously likeable, approachable, down-to earth, focussed, human. His genius was the innovative transformation of traditional folk melodies and source materials. Whether Dylan likes it or not,it was as an acoustic guitar-playing(with harmonica)singer-song-writer and folk singer that he became so famous world-wide. Those early, idealistic, traditional themes were well captured by his lyrical fecundity, guitar-strumming,his wordplay, his emotional range and stylistic diversity. But above all it was his amazing voice, highly-wrought, plaintive,sarcastic, tender, humorous, full of conscience and yearning that bowled people over. His longetivity and chameleon changes,testament. Part 2 is less absorbing lacking the integral freshness of part1 and wecould have gone up to the mid 70s, There are lots of scenes taken from Don’t Look Back and Festival. Dylan meant more than it’s possible for any singer to matter now. Who but Scorsese can do justice to him?

B004CLYKLI|1.0|I read this book for book club this week and had been looking forward to it. I had heard the hype and read the excerpts and expected that as I actually read it the logic and love of her parenting style would become clear. Unfortunately, it was nothing more than a very disturbing foray into a diseased mind. I was so distressed I could barely finish it. My main conclusion is that this book is nothing more than an apologia for her abusive behavior, brought on largely by an awful confrontation she has with her then 13 year old daughter. I think Ms. Chua was shaken and disturbed herself by how awful her relationship with her children was and she chose to write this book as an explanation to them and a defense of herself. The fact that it has become a best seller is nothing more than a side benefit. The end of this story has not been written yet. At the time this book was finished, her children were still living at home and still under her draconian control. It will be very interesting to see how much they adore this \\"Mommy Dearest\\" once they have escaped her. As a final note I blame and revile her husband for knowing better and standing idly by and allowing his children to be so grossly mistreated and abused. Do not buy this book. If you have to satisfy your curiosity borrow it from the library but please, please do not put another penny into this criminally abusive parenting pairs pocket.
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|What absolutely brilliant composition by The Chemical Brothers. This is now one of my favorite albums of all time. The emotion and mental images transmitted through the music are unsurpassed. It is hard to describe. You'll just have to give it a listen... or ten. 10/10.
0439023513|5.0|Collins delivered a cohesive, action-packed conclusion to her \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy. I loved every page of this book, and was amazed that the action just kept growing and growing, chapter after chapter. This volume in particular portrays her strong skill as a writer. Sometimes in trilogies, the author doesn't portray the confidence to give a clean finish in the last book. Collins went into the story balls-out, and delivered a beautiful end that left me disappointed that there wasn't more.<br /><br />My only complaint was the resolution to the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. I wish I would have felt closer to this part of the story, and there would have been more emphasis on Katniss making a decision instead of it just of falling into her lap. That being said, I still highly recommend the entire trilogy.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|Brilliant and different second album- Paulo continues to do his own thing- influence by many genres but exclusive to none- a young man with a distinct way with words. Excellent
B004ISVH6G|1.0|Have followed this guy for many, many years, some albums were mixed bags, while others were sleeper gems (Temple Bar & Mask Of Smiles). First off the listener will notice right away that John is no longer singing a full line any longer; he'll sing a  few words, pause + mix some heavy hard rocking guitars and then complete the sentence. Seriously,  the singing voice might not be there?  Mention might because the guy simple  doesn't sing on this album.  You hear way too much hard rock and even some blues rock, which I have no problem with, but I didn't buy the album to listen to a backing band play.      The songs aren't catchy, including the remake track.  Avoid this one and after listening to this, it is clear that John Waite's musical career is finished.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Stevie Nicks enters a new decade with an album that makes you wonder what took her so long; the cover drops Stevie from a crystal bubble, with a hazy white horse and the songstress entering from what looks like a location shoot from \\"Lord of The Rings.\\" The picture teases you in a fashion that states, \\"You wanted a welsh witch? You got it.\\" \\"In Your Dreams\\" delivers all the kind of music you'd expect from Stevie, even forty years since her rise to super-stardom.<br /><br />Listening to \\"In Your Dreams\\" is a potent reminder of exactly how much Nicks' has influenced singers (not just women) for the past four decades. The nervous sense of drama, the urgency of all things mystical, the forcefulness of her femininity, these are all on display on this album. At the same time, I couldn't help but think of younger bands/singers. Everyone from Taylor Smith to Coldplay have copped some of Stevie's dramatic style for their own. Heck. there's even a vampire song her that she claims was inspired by watching \\"Twilight.\\" Somewhere in England, Muse is rejoicing.<br /><br />What makes \\"In Your Dreams\\" an album of the now is just how Stevie has kept to her own muse. Picking apart an Edgar Allan Poe poem (\\"Annabelle Lee\\") and recreating it as a song is pure Stevie, while name checking Anne Rice and having a spirit flit from woman to woman in \\"Soldier's Angel\\" (my favorite song on the album) takes to back to such classic albums as \\"Rumours\\" or \\"Bella Donna.\\" Producer Dave Stewart even gets into the act by being Stevie's Don Henley on the closing song \\"Cheaper Than Free.\\" Or, some might say, his Lee Hazelwood to Nicks' Nancy Sinatra. Either way you look at it (and you can add Lindsey Buckingham to the list of bargains on the album), \\"In Your Dreams\\" puts Stevie back into prominence.
0439023521|5.0|My first impression of this book was Shirley Jackson's short story, \\"The Lottery\\", on crack. I went into the story with an idea of what's going on (but not really), and a growing desperation to fight for the main character, Katniss--both for her life, and the lives of those she loves. It possessed a beautifully written, well thought-out plot that begged me to turn the page. Collins did an impressive job of making the reader a part of her imagined world. I couldn't wait to get started on the next chapter of the story, Catching Fire. As a side note, this was written in present tense--something you don't see a lot, but Collins did it well.
0553582038|2.0|Others have posted a more comprehensive review that will amplify what I have to say about this series.    First, you should always finish a story that you start.  RR has exponentially increased the number of new story lines, without giving real closure to others (that we're more invested in at this point)    Second, a good writer, while holding audience captive, should not leave his mob \\"presuming\\" the story line.    Third.   After 4, now 5 books, this story could have been told in 3.  He even confesses at the end of this book in his own author notes that \\"this one was a bitch\\"--  a confession from the author that he even feels lost to the real arc of the story. Also, the LAST \\"chapter\\" entitled \\"meanwhile, back at the wall\\" (like some batman graphic novel!) the author also identifies this gaff by not really keeping true to the story line.    MINOR SPOILER:   Here are characters you will NOT read about in book four:  BRAN, JON, CATELYN (despite red wedding and epilogue of book 3); DAVOS, TYRION (how can this be?) and Queen DAENERYS (holy R'holler!);  FURTHERMORE, you have to adjust to RENAMING of characters:  ARYA's and SANSA (aka ALAYNE).     As a consumer only, I feel I have the wits and authority to know \\"epic\\" writing and stories:   goodkind, brooks, tolkien, perhaps even jordan.  (I'm not bestowing their greatness on RR Martin to be sure).   And this review may be an ill fated incompatibility to emerge between myself and the author's style.     R.R. has strayed WAY off the kingsroad with this tome-  introducing new characters to story lines that scarcely seem relevant; IGNORING others that we have a vested interest in since book one.   Too much for me.      He has departed the westeros for the dollar and cheats his audience -- with no direction, no clarity, no closure to be certain.  I'm not referring to his character vs. chronology style here-- I'm talking about story telling that makes sense to the story. I happen to come to enjoy the character based chaptersuntil 60% of all my characters were suddenly and inexplicably dropped in book four (no not the dead characters).    Regrettably, I am sucked in.    But I warn the reader of this review;  may the others take you and the seven gods punish you if you think this book gets you any further through the blundering morass of a plot the author has chosen to make for us.   First 2 books are great story telling-- 3  almost as good.   The FOURTH creates a shambles of what was started.      While I don't know the man, it is this kind of \\"straying\\" that leads me to believe he is more interested in the COIN than that of his story and the world he originally created.    BEWARE with this book, R.R appears to have emerged our mad king!!!   Take Heart!
0143115014|2.0|Although this is certainly a fun book to own, with some excellent writing, there's NO doubt in my mind that a lot of these reviews are slapdash.    For example, from the review of Escentric 01 it's PAINFULLY obvious the reviewer never actually smelled the fragrance.    Both Molecule 01 and Escentric 01 are described as being composed of \\"only Iso Super E,\\" which is untrue: Molecule 01 is Iso Super E only; Escentric 01 is primarily lime and pepper, which could only be omitted from a review if the fragrance had never actually been sampled (or never researched: not sure which is worse).     While I understand the task of putting together a fun, comprehensive volume of this size is daunting at best, still the writers do a grave disservice to the EQUALLY grueling effort of the perfumers when they fail to take the proper care and time in their own creative undertaking.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Tried them all and Evernote is by far the best. I use it all the time, from the Web, my MacBook, Dell and Droid X. Evernote is intuitive and has a fabulous supportive and instructive website.    Feels like I can take any data and just throw them at Evernote - and they will be right where I need them next time I open it!
0316069353|5.0|One of Connelly's best!  He had me guessing right up to the very end and even then I couldn't figure it out until almost the very last line or two.  One of his that kept me up very late at night for a couple of nights.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This was an excellent DVD movie.  It was too short though.....  I could have watched more and more of it.  It was interesting.
1400031567|4.0|I had a hard time putting down this book. I've read five of the books and this one has the tightest plot. The girl who commits suicide by burning herself up in a rapeseed field catches your attention at the beginning and Mankell pulls you along with murders, revelations and suspense until the very end. In his personal life, Wallander has to deal with a long distance girlfriend, the World Cup, a father who has Alzheimer's and a distant daughter. Mankell makes decaying Swedish society a character in the plot. There's a melancholy tone in the novel that fits in well with Wallander's ambivalence to his job.      The translation is good, but quirky. The book is a good read.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Simply put, the greatest piece of animation of our time, and one of the best of all time. Perhaps not the greatest animated film of all time, but we still have two more installments to go.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Delivery was fast, and packaging was great, but trying to install this was a little difficult because the manual was extremely minimalistic. Basically the manual consisted of maybe 3 pictures and a sentence or two that weren't very descriptive. However, with a little time thinking, staring at the pictures, and laying out the parts, I was able to figure it out just using common sense. After installing it, temperatures dropped by almost 50 degrees Celsius from my stock fan (Intel i7 2.67 Ghz). My temperatures stay in a range of between 41C and 55C while I watch videos, play World of Warcraft, and browse the web. It's the perfect heatsink/fan, and I'm sure I could overclock my processor with it if I need to. I'm extremely happy and satisfied with it.
0316098337|3.0|This definitely has an original story line.  Can't say I've read anything like it, and it kept me reading.  I wasn't captivated however.  Probably because it didn't move fast enough for me. I was warn down by the ongoing pages of day to day things they were doing in Room in the beginning.  Perhaps this was needed in order to create a picture of their lives together as captives.  only three stars here, didn't love it, didn't hate it.
0446581348|3.0|Bobbi Brown is not like other makeup artists. If you know Brown from her other books, then you know that her style is natural makeup. If you know Brown even more then you know this book is a big improvement for women of color. However, the book retain the usual subjects (skin, face, lips, and eyes), adds a few new subjects, and expand on old ones. However, you will soon see why this is not the best book for African skin tones.<br /><br /> Well received was the tutorial for the correctors and Brown teaches how to choose correctors and foundation, step-by-step apply them, recommend more foundations shades if needed, and did a tutorial on how to bridge the two. The tutorials were the best of the entire chapters because they dealt with problems African women have that are not touched upon in other makeup books. African women had better enjoy those tutorials, because that all African women receive. That is where the problems begin.<br /><br /> Powders are briefly touched upon and we arrive at bronzers. Brown lists only two tones for African skin: \\"Dark\\" like Vanessa Williams or \\"deepest\\" like Venus Williams. Before she recommends a bronzer for women as \\"medium dark\\" as Jennifer Lopez. However, Vanessa Williams is light tan and Venus Williams is not \\"deepest,\\" an example would be Alek Wek. Giving bronzer recommendation for only two out of maybe 8-10 dominate skin tones in the African community is ludicrous and unhelpful.<br /><br /> Blushes are broken down into about seven types, but only three types get tutorials. Brown should have given a tutorial on chubby pencils and cheek tints, which she says herself, are the most difficult. There are also no recommendations on blushes for skin tones. So many African women are scared of wearing blush and do not even know where to start, or if they can even wear blush. Brown does do a table on what colors would be great to achieving a natural lip colors for different colored lips and expanded the table for anyone that does not have pale lips.<br /><br /> In Brown's Beauty Evolution book, she give pales lips four shades options. If you had medium lips or two-tone, you had two options, if you had dark lips, one. It is offensive that people with the palest lips had more options than darker lipped people did. Now, everyone can choice between five shades. It is offensive as an African woman to read that you can only wear so many shades, colors, and hues while fairer women have an array of options.<br /><br /> In the brows section, Brown does not mention on how to bring out golden or warmer tones in African skin, which is possible with brows. Sam Fine has done it and Brown can too. She does not even give tips on which brow colors. It is the same dilemma in the eye shadow section. No mentions how to use Africans tones to create a look, highlight color options, or how to make eye seem more awake.<br /><br /> Ten-step guide and the Diverse Beauty are the worst. There is no ten-step guide or many tips in the Diverse Beauty section for African woman. \\"African American\\" women receive three tips. Why does Brown name it \\"African American\\" beauty? There is no difference from Nigerian, Ghanaian, or Jamaican beauty. We are all the same race. However, you will be happy to know that other women with different backgrounds receive around 5-8 tips.<br /><br /> African people only had about two tutorials thought out the whole book. Good, though there could have been more. If you are African and looking for a makeup book to help you, I would recommend Sam fine's \\"Fine Beauty\\" and the DVD \\"The Basics of Beauty.\\" They are for beginners, but Fine's materials are a lot more helpful for African skin than Brown's provides. Because Brown skimps for African women, it gets three stars. Some chapters are useless, other have less depth, and with so few tutorials, the book is not very helpful.
1905236379|5.0|My 2 year old LOVES this book and the included sing along CD. It tells about what they see on the car ride home from Grandpa's house.  -A white helicopter, purple train, pink tractor, green digger, black crane, blue barge, etc. It includes detailed, interesting pictures.  I would highly recommend it!
B003UESJEM|5.0|Every year there seems to be an intelligent, quite worthy film that gets completely overlooked when the Oscars and other critical awards are given out.  THE COMPANY MEN (2010) is such a film.<br /><br />Exquisitely written and directed by John Wells, THE COMPANY MEN is a sad chronicle of our times.  It yearns for an earlier period, not that long ago, when Americans made \\"things\\" that they could point to and be proud of (e.g. cars, ships), rather than just \\"make money\\".<br /><br />The story deals with America's economic downturn and the devastating effect it has on three men, all highly successful and in upper management or executive positions, who are the victims of corporate downsizing.  Once they finally comprehend the realities of their dire circumstances, each of these men deal with their individual situations in completely different, even tragic, ways.<br /><br />The cast of this film is superb, not a false note among them.  They include Ben Affleck, Chris Cooper, Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Maria Bello, Rosemarie Dewitt and Craig. T. Nelson.<br /><br />The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment has a number of extras, including audio commentary by Wells, a \\"Making of\\" featurette, several deleted scenes and an \\"Alternate Ending,\\" which, frankly, I think works better than the one used in the final film.<br /><br />THE COMPANY MEN may deal with a painful subject, but it is an excellent movie.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

1416914307|5.0|I absolutely love Cassandra Clare's writing style in all of the books I have read by her.  Her writing instantly grabbed me and made it where I could hardly put the book down to do other stuff.  There was plenty of action throughout the book to keep a person interested.  I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series and the Infernal Devices.  If you like fantasy and supernatural, this is definitely a great read and well worth the time spent.
0345529057|5.0|Someone at Barnes and Noble suggested this series to me and i found it on amazon for 4 books in a set at the same price that one would have cost me at B&N. I fell in love from the first page and find myself staying up way too late at night just so I can find out what happpens next! Buy this series! You will love it. The box set is convenient and compact and it arrived in perfect condition!

B003Y5H54W|5.0|to all of u naysayers who gave this 1, 2, or wished to give it negative stars; there are innumerable horrible movies out there that makes this one look incredible! u all should really get out more... the film is visually stunning, has an intriguing and mysterious storyline, wonderful cast, and is well acted. perhaps u should suspend ur negative judgmental minds B4 seeing certain films or possibly not even go at all, if u can't b open minded... even the worst things in life have good and positive things about them, if ur brave enough to actually look... instead of hyperfocusing on the bad... ENJOY!!!

It's also moving (that may be because I can relate to it well?) with lovable characters, no matter what they are!

B003Y5H542|1.0|My wife and I were very excited to see Rango, especially after seeing the previews. The only positive side of this movie is the absolutely gorgeous computer animation. The textures, colors, characters look incredible. However this movie put both of us and most of the audience asleep. The children in the theater were restless and MANY families left half-way through the movie. In our humble opinion, this movie was soooo boring. NOTHING like Ice Age, Shrek, etc.. The comedy just wasn't there, the desert / wild west theme got old quick, and the story really was quite boring. I will pass on this Blu-Ray disc. This is not a children's film and has none of the humor you would expect.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have some of the same issues as others, occasionally it drops the station, perhaps this is more related to the quality of the stream or the wi-fi or 3g/4g networks. I do not believe it to be the fault of the app, as I see it occur with other similar apps.  Even with the minor issues, this is still a 5 star app!
0811876373|5.0|This book is super cute. Lots of pictures, lots of detailed instructions and tons of tips. Theres information on which candies to use, where to buy prodcts and measurements too... A super helpful book for beginners and perfect for experts. Still trying to work on the difficult ones... I recommend this book to all.. Have fun

B00004XPPB|4.0|Slightly depressing at times, but overall a good reenactment. I'm not sure how accurate it is compared to the true events, but I think it portrayed the interactions and emotions as they might be in that situation. Very well done.
B000060MMI|5.0|Having heard one of the tracks from this album on a film recently I thought I'd give this a go and I am so glad I did.  `Drunken Lullabies' is one of those albums that is truly infectious and which leaves you with a big grin plastered over your face.  Flogging Molly can best be described as Irish punk folk, but they aren't too heavy and the folk side is perfectly balanced with the punk.  The album opener `Drunken Lullabies' shows you what a treat you are in for, with it's thumping drums, addictive fiddle and punk/folk vocals you are soon captivated and stamping your feet along with wild abandon.  The rest of the album continues in much the same vein, but one of the gentler tracks is `If I Ever Leave this World Alive' which is a beautiful ballad with poignant lyrics, and a gentle build-up throughout the song where more instruments gradually come in, until the song reaches it's crescendo.  Magnificent stuff.  This album manages to offer a good mix of music that lifts the spirits and leaves you wanting more.  There is also a bonus track at the end of a live performance that show their live audiences love them as much as you'd expect after hearing this.  This band is well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0618680004|4.0|Even as a man who believes in a creator I enjoy a strong argument and keep an extremely open mind to different possibilities and ideas. He even suggests books like Finding Darwin's God by Catholic/Biologist Kenneth Miller for people who feel slighted by Michael Behe's proposal. As a person who is not an atheist or a catholic/christian I have enjoyed both of their work. I subscribe to the notion that the answer is somewhere in the middle which seems fair. There are strong points that I agree with from Dawkins book about Religious Organizations, money, and filling in gaps with god. Some of his points are subjective as far as describing \\"God\\" and have a hint of a teenager mad at his parents for not letting him go out to the theatre on a school night. Dawkins is very clever and obviously intellegent and his book The God Delusion should be read by everyone who is looking to shape their perspectives and for theists not afraid to take a punch on the chin.    More works that I have enjoyed of this nature have been; The Science of God by Gerald Schroeder. God is not Great by Chris Hitchens. God According to God by Gerald Schroeder. The Case for Judaism by Dennis Prager.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|In 1966, after a hallucination in a hospital room, legendary Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman got the idea for \\"Persona,\\" a film about personality, humanity and the doubtfullness of general existence. This is Bergman's best film ever, as it paints a vivid and visceral portrait of human life and shattered personalities. Some of the film's imagery is troubling and shocking, and the visual language of the movie speaks volumes about the human psyche. Bergman's best creation, this fantastic film is right up there with Citizen Kane, The Godfather, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, There Will Be Blood, Network, Goodfellas and Un Chien Andalou as one of the ten best movies in all cinematic creation. Astounding.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|I decided to read this book after a friend recommended it. I have to be honest and say that the first 2 chapters I was not impressed. I kinda laughed because Hannah seemed so pathetic and stupid for sending out these \\"tapes.\\" However, as the story unfolded you begin to see the world of a young girl start to crash down. and i can understand these feelings so well. i honestly loved this book and i read it in 3 days. I could not put the book down similar to how clay can't stop listening to the tapes. The amazing part of this book is that we all have felt like hannah some point in our lives. at the end of the book, you begin to really feel her pain and i found that quite incredible. a must read for every high schooler and college student seriously. i learned from this book that your words can kill somebody. i hope the movie gives the book the credit it deserves!
1601251505|5.0|I have been playing this system with a group of friends for months, and always asking to borrow a book to attempt to quickly locate something I need was always slowing thing down. Now I can look up my pages and such ahead of time, pre-read what I need, and not have to have everyone else help me with me character when they need the time to deal with their own. The games go SO much more smoothly now!

B004DMIIOG|5.0|So... in the near future the internet has coalesced into the online VR realm known as 'Oz'.  This online world is populated by avatars of nearly every person on Earth with access to a computer and internet.  People, companies, governments, all are online in Oz.  Very similar to the internet we know today except that this online world is hosted in a virtual reality interface of sorts.<br /><br />So to the film:  Though this isn't quite as solid as their film \\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\\", it is a stunning film nonetheless.  The animation is fantastic, especially the computer animation used to depict Oz.  The characters are all likable, and the Japanese voice acting solid.<br /><br />Essentially this is a story about friendship, family, and togetherness.  There are a few sad moments, some funny moments, but overall it is very touching and heart warming.  The computer program as a villain is nothing new, but it is given a new and sinister twist in this film.  It is enjoyable to watch the main character Kenji fumble around, lacking common sense and confidence in the beginning, 'man up' as the movie progresses.  The film is well paced and I never felt it was too long or too rushed.<br /><br />Madhouse has something good going and I hope to see more of these types of films being released from their animation studio.
0316044695|5.0|Could not put the book down,a very good read. Made me very proud of our military, but very upset with our rules of engagement. This needs to be changed to protect our troops in time of war! This story proves it.

B0036T31YY|5.0|This is a movie that starts off one kind of way with a bog standard cast and a bog standard \\"creepy ship\\" and then goes on to a very different place.  Part of the accomplishment of this movie is that it's not based on shock value or on high production.  It's based on psychology, and the lead actress carries off the emotional beats perfectly.
0061841935|5.0|Very well written and at times very funny autobiography of comedian Craig Ferguson. He talks about his childhood in Scotland and his numerous careers, his desire to become an American, and especially his drug and alcohol problems. The audiobook was nominated for a Grammy for \\"Best Spoken Word Album.\\" He's an excellent narrator and his Scottish accent is a joy to listen to. I highly recommend the audio book. Great to listen to in the car on the way to work.
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|There are artists much older and much more experienced who never make albums as solid and raw as All We Know is Falling. The instrumental is fantastic. The vocals are powerful. The lyrics are sometimes clumsy, but no more childish than a lot of songs we hear by adults on the radio.     Paramore couldn't have had a better debut to the world. They manage to fit into the pop-punk-rock mix that was becoming hugely popular at the time, while at the same time avoiding the whiny self pity that a lot of other artists in the genre were full of. Instead, All We Know is Falling was heartfelt and sincere.     Paramore would go on to do bigger and better things, but their first album was still an impressive accomplishment  that set the stage for a promising career.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is an adult film... we'll let the kids watch it too. But it is entertaining on an adult level.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|On Brand New Eyes, Paramore returns as a more bitter and road-wary group. Their lyrics are full of apologies, anger, and warnings against getting caught up in your dreams. They question their relationships, their faith, and themselves.<br /><br />Some of the biggest hits off of this album (\\"Ignorance,\\" \\"Playing God\\") are some of the angriest, while others (\\"The Only Exception\\") are all about putting past failures aside and learning to love. This one goes in all kinds of directions. It chronicles the lives of a group of people in a band about to fall apart, as we learned later. It's a very naked, emotional album. It's also a group of people growing as artists and experimenting with sounds and writing their most versatile album ever.<br /><br />The aforementioned \\"Ignorance\\" is a blistering rock song. At the same time, out of nowhere, comes the quiet and somber \\"Misguided Ghosts.\\"  Then there's the soulful and (at first) subdued \\"All I Wanted.\\"<br /><br />Brand New Eyes is a success however you look at it. It shows the band growing and evolving, while simultaneously falling apart. Nothing makes for better music than that.
B003UESJH4|5.0|In today's techno world. A dubbed recording is nothing. Take two or twenty it makes no difference, the package is always perfect. In this film the new King must face three enemies. Hitler, his speaking problem and the infernal machine that will broadcast his live voice to millions. The cast is fantastic the script both touching and humorous. The story of accomplishment outstanding.
0756655730|5.0|This is a gorgeous book!  You can read it straight through or pick it up and turn to any page, and it has a world of information in there, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates that lived through the ages and even little biographies of different scientists as well.  The thing that really makes this book though is the pictures, they are absolutely amazing!!!  My 3 year old loves to turn the pages and look at all the pictures (especially the dinosaurs) and will look at every page in turn it is so enthralling.  Excellent book and totally worth the money!

B004X0XA82|1.0|The continuum here is from Beach Boys (Phil Spector) production to Paul Simon's vocal delivery. Only, we're stuck with songs where the singer asks why the earth revolves around the sun. Stuck in prog's past, you wish there was some fresh idea outside of the failed free jazz experiment of \\"The Shrine/An Argument.\\" Pretentious song titles aside, why has no one written about the outright theft of Bob Dylan's \\"Fourth Time Around\\" which magically appears, guitar melody and all, in \\"Lorelai.\\" Maybe they'll settle out of court or at least give Bob the songwriting credit it deserves. In the end, the Crosby, Stills, and Nash albums are not very good either. Musically, this seems as uninteresting as their first. Then again, I didn't care for The Association's \\"Windy\\" or \\"Cherish\\" either.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This film is excellent. Yes, it isn't full of action for the Facebook/Twitter ADHD generation, but if you watch this movie for it is, a detached masterpiece of escapism, then you will fall in love with it. With everything. The characters. The story. And the \\"slowness\\".

1594744769|4.0|Miss Peregrine's is more dark fantasy then horror - it reminded me a little of some of Guillermo del Toro 's movies, such as Pan's Labyrinth.  Lots of weird imagery and foreboding atmosphere.  It makes for entertaining reading.<br /><br />The story starts with the close relationship between a boy and his grandfather, a colorful old man fond of telling tall tales - or at least that's what they seem to be at first.  Jump ahead a few years and the grandfather has died mysteriously, ravaged by some powerful animal in his back yard.  The boy, now 16, looks into the old man's dying words, something about a book by Ralph Waldo Emerson, and what he finds gets him to thinking that there might be more to the old man's stories then he'd thought.  The premise might sound familiar, but the story moves in some surprising directions.<br /><br />Don't let the narrator put you off either.  He comes off as an overpriveleged, self centered, whiny, suburban teenager early in the story(not really a bad kid, just annoying), but he does grow up quickly once the story picks up and he faces some adversity while investigating the island that his grandfather had told him about.<br /><br />The book is heavily illustrated with photographs that feature in the story.  There's a new one every few pages and they are always interesting.  Sometimes absurd, funny, creepy, or all of the above.  If you are a kindle owner, you might want to think about getting the paper copy of this book.  I love my kindle, but I'm not sure that it could do this book justice.  The book itself looks great, and is one you might want to have on your bookshelf.
B004TRKHSK|5.0|This album comprises years 20-23 of my life.  The naivety, the innocence, the unrelenting energy, but above all- passion.  Rickets is likely the most honest way to sum up the album. \\"You're probally right...but this time I don't wanna listen.\\"  Unknowing that White Pony was around the corner of Around the Fur, this album could have been a pinnacle that so many bands couldn't even find the path toward. Be Quiet and Drive is the love song of the 90's...period.  Having seen this band for the thirtieth time, they are definitely aging and past their prime, as am I. What has yet to happen is that the music has passed its purpose...the emotions, issues and themes attached to this recording are as timeless as any classic American work.  Youth is all about energy and no outlet or answer.  The honesty expressed in this album and approach that counters Adrenaline was bold, ballsy and counterproductive to royalty checks. While the secret track will likely always remain in main top five because it expresses that true love often involves hate (sooner or later)...this is only the beginning to the career of a band that still has a thing or two to say yet. Only if we all could be so lucky.
B004G6009K|5.0|Disney once again proves itself by the release of Tangled in 3D.  The effects are amazing and worth it for anyone who has access to a 3D television.  The movie itself is wonderful in 2D but the effects of 3D certainly take it to the next level.  By all means, see it if you can.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|I had to watch this for a film class I took and I found it to be superb.  All of the various camera angles,cuts and, dissolves were just flawless.  I felt like I was watching the first \\"modern type\\" of movie that was ever made.  Films I've watched before this seemed dated. I could go on and on but I don't feel like typing anymore.
0307887960|3.0|The Dukan Diet is difficult to follow because you're always hungry and feel weak. My husband has been on this diet for 2 weeks and has lost 7 lbs. which isn't that bad but, not that good for as little as he's been eating.  He has included the Wheat Bran Flakes and is still having trouble with constipation.  He will continue onward and we both hope for the best!  When you cook the \\"Galette\\", warm the skillet to medium, put galette mixture into skillet then turn down the heat to lo.  Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Higher heat, it will scorch.  I serve it with sugar-free maple syrup because otherwise, it's very bland.
B004SEUJN2|1.0|Gee you shouldn't have.  I read somewhere that this disc would have all of the extras ported over from the special edition and that the movie would be remastered.  Well there are no extras only movie trailers.  About the remastering well my picture book makes no mention of it.  I did not buy the old blu ray because there were no extras.  Now I have a 'picture' book with no extras.  Maybe that's why Amazon didn't bother putting up a picture.  I upgraded this disc with Se7en.  The latter is a COMPLETE book with a superior picture and great EXTRAS.  This picture book SO not worth the money.  Buyer beware!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I know many fans are disappointed with this cd but I feel that this is the real Josh... his voice isnt strained and he isnt making it sing a genre of music that his voice obviously from the last recording was harder on his vocal chords....Yes this cd is very played down from his last BUT its more relaxing, clear, even toned, controlled and I can tell he put alot of heart in this recording and I Love it!!!
0060254920|5.0|One of Maurice Sendak's most well know children's book \\"Where the Wild things Are\\" is a book about a little boy named Max that gets sent to  his room without supper and goes into his own world where he meets the wild things. This book is written in the genre of fantasy much like most of Sendak's books. The book is a good look into the imagination of a child and what they can think of. This story is easy for any child to relate to because it is very possible that when they are sent to their room they can think of something like this. The illustrations are what makes this book easy to enjoy because of their use of textures and the different looks of the different monsters. I read the book when I was a kid and read it again as an adult and the story and pictures still make it an enjoyable read. When I'm a parent I'm probably going to read it o my own child and hopefully they will love it like I love it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Hi. this isnt a review but a question . Can anyone tell me if the R1 version of this series is cut ?.. Apparently the version submitted to the BBFC in the Uk is a pre-cut version with cuts to episodes 2 and 5 . Starnge as it was aired on Uk tv uncut (so i believe)... Can anyone help me in this matter ?  Many thanks .
B000GIXIGY|5.0|The album was a big part of thew transition in which rock musicians in the early seventies were determined to show that there music was legitimate and required talent Not Just gliiter and lifestyle. This movement spawned the likes of Yes, King Crimson and jethro Tull.   Renaissance provided and epic combination of Classic Piano and vocal  (definitely Prescient of the celtic woman style) a direct break with the blues tradition  yet still  neatly fit with the pop rock genre of the time. A must have recording.
B000M341QE|5.0|When the TV ads for this film first popped up, I was telling friends that this was the first Scorcese film in YEARS that I was actually excited about seeing, and it was the same time as a De Palma film as well. But, since Brian and his film (\\"The Black Dahlia\\") took such a beating for God knows what reasons unknown to any intelligent person, I took a 'political' stance and trashed Scorcese and his film, because I have felt for the past 12 years that Martin Scorcese is the most over hyped, over praised, overrated director in the industry; with people throwing roses at his films, while in the meantime they hate my favorite director Brian De Palma, and want to heave meat cleavers at his classic films. But I do love \\"The Departed\\" a lot more than I ever thought that I would.<br /><br />Yes, Martin Scorcese is the most overrated, overly hyped, highly praised director living today. And, for what? Well, I'll tell you: It's for his latest film, \\"The Departed\\"! He did once make some really great films, like \\"Mean Streets\\", \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"The Color of Money\\", \\"Raging Bull\\", \\"The Last Waltz\\", and \\"Goodfellas\\". But, that's been over 15 years ago. \\"Casino\\" was alright, but it was just an attempt at remaking \\"Goodfellas\\". And, films like \\"Gangs of New York\\", \\"Bringing Out the Dead\\", and \\"The Aviator\\" just didn't strike my fancy. His remake of \\"Cape Fear\\" was good, but nowhere near as great as he used to be.<br /><br />But, lo and behold, Marty has remade another film, \\"Infernal Affairs\\", and made himself a new classic that he deserved every accolade thrown his way for. He definitely deserved the Best Director award at the Academy Awards for this. For all of you people who praise Scorcese like he's God, well, I have to say you're right on this one. This is an extremely deep and profound and intense fast paced masterpiece of modern cinema that will leave you utterly breathless in practically every scene. And, it is rich with irony! Especially the plot of having, not one, but two moles, each one on a different side than the other.<br /><br />Brilliant storytelling at its best! I just didn't like that a certain character got killed in the end that should have lived, but that's not going to taint my judgement of this great film.<br />Scorcese is on fire here, making quick cuts left and right, entering scenes through a circle point of view, cutting back and forth between scenes and characters, past and present, and using an extremely terrific soundtrack to boost the film along like a freight train to H*ll. This kicks people like Tarantino back into Kindergarden!! This is possibly the best crime thriller genre film that I've seen in years.<br /><br />Everybody in the film is perfect for their roles, and their performances all shine through. This isn't near as gory as a lot of people make it out to be. It is violent, but no more so than any of Coppolla's \\"Godfather\\" films, and even less so than Scorcese's own \\"Goodfellas\\". Marty really out did himself with this one. Higly recommended! Thank you. :>)g, not one, but two moles, each one on a different side than the other.     Brilliant storytelling at its best!

1594202710|1.0|Kissinger got many facts wrong.  He praised Butcher Mao highly for toppling the feudalistic empire, liberating and unifying China.  My blood almost boiled upon hearing this from Kissinger.  How much worse can a politician twist facts.  It was Sun Yet-Sen, the founding father of Republic China, who overthrew the last emperor of Qing dynasty and established the first republic state in China.  It was Mao who reverted back to a feudalistic-like totalitarian regime and divided the nation to a red China and Taiwan.  Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia have suffered so much under the communist rule that not a single day the people there cease to dream of separating from the red China.<br /><br />However, facts twisting is not the worst part of the book.  Kissinger ignored the plight of Chinese people under the communist rule and focused only on amending relationship with the power broker of the most bloodthirsty regime.  Principle and humanity are merely empty words to Kissinger, power and wealth are more appealing to him.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app! I have had trouble waking up for...well, forever. This alarm has an option (set as default) to wake you gently with a gradual increase in volume. Add to that the giant snooze button and smaller dismiss button, the option to do math problems (setting the difficulty and quantity of problems), and the ability do decrease the duration between snoozes (ie. 10 mins for first snooze, then decrease by 2 minutes each snooze thereafter), and/or increase the number of math problems after each snooze.

0316098329|4.0|I figured that with a 4 star average after 850+ reviews this book must be good and I certainly was not disappointed. The first 50 pages start out a little slow as you are wondering what the hell is going on and trying to be patient with all of the first person dialogue from a 5 year old. The book is divided into five \\"chapters\\" and as soon as you get to the end of the first \\"chapter\\" you're instantly hooked and don't want to stop reading. This book is very unique and very well written, with my only complaint being that some of the first person dialogue from the 5 year old seems a little advanced and at times hard to believe. With that said, the author does a fantastic job of capturing his world and the world in general through the eyes of a 5 year old and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way to keep you turning page after page.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|liked it as much as let the right one in.many people would have probably ruined the storyline from the original film like many movie remamkes had in the past.but this one isn't such a film because i really enjoyed this one and was pretty close to being like the original.definetely got to check this one out.really good movie worth the watch

B001GMH8TM|5.0|Not being much of a movie person, I was surprised to just learn that right-wing Christians apparently love to give a reactionary Christian interpretation of this film. And in my untutored cinematic mind, and addicted to Ockham's Razor, I thought always of a simpler explanation. Since it is set in one of those \\"pre-planned\\" communities in Florida, often with a very conservative bent behind them, I thought the movie was a simple commentary on the the conformity of such environments, and the busy-body obsessiveness of them as well.<br /><br />But since people apparently having been using this movie as a screen for their religious projections for quite a while, I am going to give my own interpretation. Since I went to college seminary in Miami it fits with Florida. The movie is really about being in the seminary in Florida. You are basically watched 24-7, and yet you are told you are happy and progressing in spiritual growth. Some escape, but others stay in the show forever, getting sicker and sicker.<br /><br />I praise God that I escaped the show so many years ago!

B004EPYZUI|1.0|Are you people insane?? Do you have brains whatsoever?  People who likes this movie, is people who only wants no-sense action and visuals.  It really takes you out of the equation when it comes to criticize a movie.  Really.    There is no connection between the scenes or the themes, or the characters \\"motives\\"    It is the worst movie I've saw in the last few years. And I saw a lot of Z-Movies that I think are far better than this.  There are really few bad movies. And I mean BAD movies. Movies that go against everything they teach you at film school. And this one does it.    If you like this movie, star thinking about taking cinema classes or judgment if possible.
B003L77GG0|3.0|My favorite episodes of Smallville were when they introduced other superhero characters.  So I LOVED the beginning part of this season where they had a bunch of different superheroes.  But at the end?  Clark adopts \\"superboy\\" and when Clark disappears for 3 weeks, no mention of Superboy.  The same with the Wedding (that did not happen).  No superheros show up to see their best friend get married?  Come on?  What a let down.  As for budgeting, the budgeting constraints were very obvious in the 2nd half of this season.  Very low budget.  If you watched this show all of the way through, you are going to buy the tenth season no matter what.  For me, from what was being said at the beginning of the season, and the quality of the first half of the tenth season, I was disappointed in the second half of the tenth season.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This has been so entertaining.  We never had HBO and the reruns on television don't do justice to this fun giftset.
081297381X|4.0|Interesting book that helps you think differently.  However Taleb is pretty full of himself and he spends a lot of time bragging about how smart he is.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! seriously like kick ass... non stop action... great story line... and is pretty freakin funny as well... i can't imagine anyone not liking it... definitely more better than good
1601251556|5.0|It is exactly what it should be. Wet or dry erase is convenient, and two sides lets you prep a detailed encounter without ever showing it to your group and avoid the setup time of drawing the whole thing. Just remember to buy markers before your first session ;)
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Gave this as a gift. Have not heard any feedback as of yet. Delivery time as promised. Product was received in great condition. Keep up the good work!!!
B0013N7AD8|5.0|This blu-ray set is really good, you get all the old Batman movies in it.  Its the same disc as the single release blu-rays so don't expect anything extra that aren't on those.  It is cheaper to get them all in this set and for me was worth it.
6304779607|5.0|Delivery time was terrible. Received about 8 days past estimated delivery time. Item was in good condition. Tracking info not consistent!!
B004L79VUI|5.0|The interplay guitar work on songs with EC, the cathartic & healing depth of lyrics, multiple of virtuoso performances,  all help to form a wonderful journey through the past, present & \\"know what's to come\\" ;)    PFL
0307887960|1.0|I wish I had reviewed this book more thoroughly.  This diet seems impossible to me and I feel I have wasted the money on the book.  There is no perfect diet!
1594744769|4.0|More years ago than I care to contemplate, I fell in love with a book destined to become a classic: Jack Finney's \\"Time and Again\\". What first interested me was its concept of building a story around a collection of old photos the author had discovered. This, I thought, was a wonderful creative challenge, one that Finney rose to brilliantly. Since then, there have been other books that used the same, or similar, starting point. Although few have come anywhere near Finney's, I keep buying them, reading them, and hoping.  Finally, after all this time, I've found a worthwhile succesor. The photos that surround the story, whether \\"found\\" or posed, who knows, are marvelous.   And then there's the title.  I mean, it wasn't as if author Ransom Riggs (is that REALLY a name?) made it easy!  Look at that title. What story could EVER be as fascinating as that title suggests? Indeed, what story could even BE about that title, and these photos, literally. They would have to be used merely as metaphors... wouldn't they?  This book is about THAT title... literally.  This book is innate to those photos... literally.  This book contains so much wonder that I won't tell you another thing about it because, if the title and the concept are not enough, you're just NOT going to \\"get\\" it!  I WILL, however, say one final thing about the \\"positioning\\" of this book.  For reasons I will never understand, publishers have decided that some books are to be categorised as \\"Young Adult\\". I don't know what this means. But, if this book is ghetto-ised a YA... and you ACCEPT that, you'll miss out on a great reading experience.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|Boy LED headlights have come a long way since my Tikka that I have been using for years.  This model has three modes; flood, spotlight, and mix of both (at what appears to be 50% power for both lights.)  It comes with the standard strap and a mount that clips directly (and securely) into my Petzl Vertx Vent helmet.  Slick.  It is a bit heavier than I am used to, but seems solid and it throws some serious light.  Another nice feature -- the light itself rotates all the way around for storage, ultimately pointing the lights back at the helmet for protection and making it impossible to turn on by accident.  The selector switch itself is easy to use while wearing gloves.  I'm very happy with Petzl equipment in general and this seems to be a great purchase!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Hearne has taken our world and made it a whole lot cooler. He has added everything from witches to demons to godesses, and made me completely fall in love with a big dorky Irish wolfhound. Not to mention a two thousand year old Druid. But this is not a romance at all, in fact there are a lot of bloody sword battles.  I have never in my life preordered Book #2 after finishing only the first chapter of the first book in a series, but not only did I do that, I preordered Book #3.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it highly enough, and I do not normally read Urban Fantasy. I have found a new auto buy author!
B0026PW67W|5.0|I recieved the map in perfect shape. I love it . It is very detailed . I guess I will have to learn to read latin , HA .
B0017YDPI2|5.0|This show is just one of the best 'supernatural' aka horror related shows of all time. It's got lots of humor and this season; while it's a short one it is still dynamite in terms of writing and acting. The show also has a broad streak of humour to it and that's a good thing too. This blu ray looks great just like the rest of the series does on this format as well, It's a dark show and this really comes out on blu ray as this wasn't shot on hd film.  It has plenty of extras too, thankfully the boys will be back for a seventh season in 2011-12. And that's more good news. I intend to buy this entire show on blu ray for my personal collection; that's how good this show is.
B002ZG9774|5.0|My Lord, what a voices have Christina and Cher, I bought the Blu-Ray and after I saw the movie I ask me, Why I don't see this movie in Big Screen?. The critics are unfair to this musical, for me, is a wonderful musical, good drama with marvelous voices.<br />I think that you can add this movie  in your personal collection without regrets.
B000002JEV|5.0|The bbc just put microphones in front of bands so the sound quality isn't as great as it could be , but that's true for most live recording from this era.  This is a great band live here and it's worth owning for many reasons. For a feel from the era , for the pure rawness of it , to hear a classic band do it right as well. It's not going to make some fans happy though who want live recordings done with better equipment than a radio show had.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This movie starts a lil dull but blasts into instant action afta the aliens \\"impact\\" the earth. Tho it would have been cooler with different variety of aliens they were well imagined and had great graphics.
B000002GBB|5.0|This band was still at the top here. They were one of the worlds best selling bands and for good reason they made great songs like 'renegade' , 'I'm Ok\\" and the rest of the songs on here. It was quite a accomplishment to make FOUR great discs in a row \\"equinox' , \\"Crystal ball\\" , \\" the grand illusion\\" , and then this one.  The next one would be far more of a pop rock deal and than this rocker and while they made  a good pop rocker they weren't at this level again till their<br />'paradise' cd.
0545091020|3.0|I absolutely LOVE The Hunger Games Trilogy. I've read the books many times and then purchased the audio book for a friend to listen to in her car on her route to and from work. The narrator Carolyn McCormick is awful! I couldn't stand listening to her, she did not read the story the way I read it in my head. She made the characters sound whiny. Which they are not. This is a great series and should be read.
B000002GB9|5.0|This one and 'equinox' are both modern masterpieces of music. They rank highly up there with the best that rock ever put out imo. This is prog rock of course and slimey people say prog rock shouldn't exist but they are wrong. I love punk and new wave too , metal turns me on but this one did everything right and it's still one of my favorite prog rock discs of all time!  Many people who have heard this also rate this very highly and for good reasons it all just clicked here for this band musically and they seemed even avante garde at the time!  So 'come sail away' with one of the most accessible and well crafted prog rock discs ever.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I love this movie.  I have seen it at the theater, on pay preview and final purchased it.  It has great affects.
B000002GB4|5.0|I can't fault styx on this one in the least it's very well made prog rock and it's still commercial with great songs. It's not as perfect as 'equinox' or 'the grand illusion' but it's sure filled with excellent songs. This isn't a power pop one as latter styx could throw out. I loved those too though.  Mr roboto is highly underrated in my opinion but lets be fair this is a cut above styx in that era still.  It was a solid disc at it's time and it's still very enjoyable to the max.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER. THE LOVE OF TWO BROTHERS. \\"THE WORLD WOULD HAVE TO BE UPSIDE DOWN TO UNDERSTAND\\". PASSION,ROMANCE, INFUSED WITH INSEST. VERY LOVING AND THE ACTORS ARE JUST GORGEOUS;)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Disc set was in perfect condition & arrived ahead of time.  I saw one episode before my purchase & wanted to watch them all asap so I bought the set!!!       Anyone looking for a different type of show to watch this is a great purchase.  My only regret was to learn that the show was cancled after a short run. I would suggest buying the Movie also \\"Serenity\\"
B003UESJF6|5.0|My son loves this movie, and I actually like it too!  Thank you, Amazon, for having it at such a great price.  This made a wonderful gift for my boy.
0451450523|5.0|I enjoyed this book because I remembered the movie from when I was little. Wish my dog hadn't eaten it before I finished it though.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|First: Amazon.com's \\"Watch it Now\\" downloads? I love 'em. With iTunes, I have to wait for a download to finish before I can start watching a new show, but not with Amazon. And that's how I watched the entirety of Season 5 of Dr. Who.<br /><br />Second: This season of Dr. Who was my first, and I do believe it's the closest I've come to seeing a perfect season of television. Considering what a TV addict I am--Buffy, Veronica Mars--that's saying a lot! I'm an American, but Dr. Who shows how to avoid so many pitfalls currently plaguing network television:<br /><br />* The fairy-tale start and the crazy introduction of the Eleventh Doctor create the exact right suspension of disbelief. Network shows, too often, either take things so seriously that the audience (also serious) questions everything, or is so tongue-in-cheek that it doesn't seem at all real. Not Dr. Who! Everyone sells the situation, even the \\"terror\\" of the Daleks, but there's enough humor that the audience plays along, which is as it should be. Heartbreak and humor! It's positively Whedonesque... or, more likely, Joss Whedon has Whovian elements to his work. Creativity may be faily timey-wimey itself.<br />* The romance--oh, the romance! I like a good (preferrably happy!) romantic subplot to my television, which is why I'd avoided Who before now--as I understood it, the rare romance was generally unrequited? And yet on American television, shows like Bones tempt the audience with will they/won't they situations while all the time fleeing an imaginary \\"Moonlighting Curse.\\" This season of Dr. Who blew that away. The Amy/Rory romance. The Doctor/River romance. They weren't allowed to overwhelm the story (duh), but they were completely satisfying.<br />* The artistic unity. By the final two episodes, I was savoring the callbacks to previous episodes and how beautifully everything came back to form a perfect circle. No episode or secondary character had been wasted--which means Nothing Was Forgotten. Too often, American television seems to lose some of its continuity. This season of Dr. Who was absolute continuity. AND--they resolved everything. On an American network, the series would have ended with the 2nd to the last episode and the tragic cliff-hanger, as if audiences can't be expected to tune back in unless they're held hostage by a need to know. Dr. Who gave us an ending so satisfying that I'll be a repeat customer. What a concept?<br /><br />Finally--the time travel. I can take or leave the space aliens, but I do love a good time travel. As a huge fan of Audrey Niffeneggar's The Time Traveler's Wife, I loved how it flavored this season of Dr. Who, from the out-of-sync romance of River Song to the redheaded girl waiting for her time traveling friend to return. I've loved time travel television from Voyagers! to Journeyman, and this season of Dr. Who in particular has shot to the top of my list.<br /><br />Watch it.ms to lose some of its continuity.
