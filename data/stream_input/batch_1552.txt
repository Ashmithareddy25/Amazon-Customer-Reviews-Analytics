0793542049|5.0|If you're still crawling on bass, Ed will lift you up and get you 'walking' in no time. I've gone through this book twice now and each time I just get better and better. The trick is to use a metronome and be patient. Listen to the recordings and play along...without stopping, that's the key.<br /><br />Thanks to this book and many others by Ed Friedland, harmonies and basslines have become second nature to me now. You'll learn about \\"approach\\" notes, which are central in melodic and jazz bass and extends to most current music styles. The greatest lesson I learned, however, is the importance of the \\"chords\\" in a song. That's really the main task of the bassist in a band--to outline the chords and support the lead and acoustic guitars.<br /><br />I really can't emphasize enough how much \\"Building Walking Bass Lines\\" will probably be one the most important bass books you'll ever study. It'll get you walking and then eventually running laps around the fretboard with ease. Buy it!!

B004JZBGWI|4.0|(Original Review) Not only is it difficult to \\"find\\" the notes you've already typed, but it just isn't a very good note pad.<br /><br />Update:  OK, I was a dode when I first starting using this App. My original rating above was a 1 and now I have to say that after using it again after my initial review, I need to update that review and my rating.<br /><br />I now have this app on my second desktop on my Android Evo and use it quite often for common lists such as Grocery List, Gear / Hardware, Music etc...I simply start the \\"note\\" with \\"Grocery List\\" for example, and then I can access that note  and then edit/delete items as needed such as when I pick up those items at the store (there is a \\"Checklist\\" feature as well that's pretty cool, but for my grocery list a \\"note\\" just seems to be easier, you'll see the differences...)<br /><br />My only suggestion for an area of improvement: When I tilt my phone horizontally in edit mode, the lines and color are lost.  It just changes the look, not the function, but I like the colored background and lines, and it would just keep it uniform in the visual aspect.<br /><br />And there it is...and here we are.  Enough already...get back to yer shoppin or onto the next review, or go outside and shovel some snow, or ...make somebody smile...ya know, something, because I have to go to the bathroom now...thank you for reading my review.  I hope it helps :0)

0345803485|5.0|This is not just a romance novel, nor is it porno,,,I see it as an intense love between two very different individuals; character development is fasinating; while the ending of Vol I is fairly predictable,it makes me want to begin Vol II III right away...you will love it as I do...
0446310786|5.0|A truly beautiful book. Scout is my little heroine and I'd love to have a daughter like her. Atticus, Calpurnia, Miss Maudie are examples of good kind hearted people and a reminder that there are still plenty of good people out there. On the other hand, people like the Ewells, Stephanie Crawford are what I call the majority. Classic examples of ignorance and hatred based on nothing but old and ridiculous believes that being a certain color or race makes you superior. This is a book that should be required reading in high school.
B001F6ZIXW|3.0|Like any series of this genre, I found there was a lot of down time.  It was entertaining, but I did not find it as compelling as a show like 24 or Breaking Bad.

There is no story, no narrative...is this an essay? an MFA thesis? something to support a grant proposal? who cares? There is no sympathetic character anywhere in sight. Self-indulgent, pretentious rubbish.

B0013O123Q|1.0|Ok I thought with the reviewed stars so high I figured this might be ok movie....guess too many drug addicts watching this trash piece...because with the stupid swirling camera, I could not figure out much of any plot.<br /><br />As for the violence...pah...seen more and better...if graphic violence is a few smacks and punches, wonder what true graphic violence is. Overall, the movie just was blah....blah blah blah....not much else.  Oh and some penises and tits....woohoo if you cared about that, otherwise trash.
B0087HT36U|5.0|$.99 is all it takes to have a great time while killing is as well (time that is)  I know a lot of people compare this to angry birds, but they shouldn't. it should stand on its own for the good game that it is. it's just a well designed, cheap game that has me wanting more from the developer. a ton of levels, bright, well thought out time killer, runs perfect on kindle fire. its funny, but I didnt think of angry birds once while playing it, but this is just my opinion. meat has spoken
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Normally I'm very suspect of any book that has only 5 star reviews, but this has 203 5 star ratings. So unless this author has a great many friends ... I thought I would give it a chance, it is a relatively cheap purchase after all.<br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The book is easy to read, has characters that are well developed, a plot that isn't easy to predict and doesn't lose itself in a myriad of subplots.<br />My one gripe is I presumed that since the title said Book One, that there would be a second book for me to purchase if I liked the first. Now I'm in a position where I want to find out what happens next but must wait until the author finishes writing it.<br />Minor Issue - thoroughly enjoyed the book. Would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to read a Fantasy book that doesn't rely on vampires, werewolves or teen angst.

B006WZLCZ4|3.0|I prefer unpainted wooden products because I've seen the Melissa & Doug painted toys chip too many times so that's one thing I appreciate about this set. I expect it to be durable based on what I see so far.<br /><br />The other thing I love about this set is that the salt and pepper shaker make noise. These instantly became baby's favorite pieces of the set. They make a realistic sound as if spices are shaking inside.<br /><br />My issue with this set is the proportions. First, the frying pan and pot are very shallow so if you put any toy foods in, you can't even stir them around with the spatula or spoon that come with the set. Second, when you try to rest the spatula or spoon inside the pot or pan, they fall out because of the shallowness. Also the silverware is larger than the plates. I feel there needs to be a little more attention paid to the usability.<br /><br />Note: the towel is not included although the description mentions one.

They don't play with ridiculous blinding speed in every piece anymore, but they more than make up for that with incredible technique developed over each guy's 50 plus years of experience at the top of the music world. And if you need speed, they can still crank it up.

I have had several instances of flash drives frying and losing all my writing.now I don't worry as much. I use it on my kindle fire and my laptop. I write A LOT and don't even come close to the quota so the free version makes it even better. :) if you are a writer give this a try. I think you will like it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Good book. The errors in editting or complete lack of editting hurt the flow of it some, but the story and characters make up for it. TOR should pick this up and clean it up much like the ryria books<br />by Michael Sullivan. Well worth the humble price however and the last half of he book you'll find yourself racing thru and excitied for the hopefully better editted sequel.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|My title says it all because that's exactly how this book makes you feel, and feel you do!! Great read and the book pulls you in to the emotional roller coaster that is Abby and Travis.
B004EPYZT4|3.0|The character of Conan the Barbarian needs no new introduction. Most people know a few things about the pop culture icon Robert E. Howard created, which Arnold Schwarzenegger played in the 1982 film adaptation. In the 2011 \\"reboot\\" of the Conan franchise Jason Momoa plays Conan the Cimmerian seeking for revenge, being the sole survivor of the massacre by Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang), a cold-blooded warlord.<br /><br />The film starts out promisingly, but it then goes downhill, descending into a sort of randomly assorted action set-pieces. The story often feels rushed, jumping from one action set-piece to another, without telling us much about the characters we are supposed to care. Jason Momoa looks perfect as a sword-wielding hero, but what he does soon becomes repetitious. Rachel Nichols (a 2009 film \\"Star Trek\\") plays Tamara, a character that always looks bored. In fact, Rose McGowan's character, an evil sorceress with a Goth makeup, was much more interesting with knowingly campy overacting.<br /><br />The film's action is certainly gory and visceral, with the stunt that in itself is decent, but \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" lacks creativity and imagination. The hectic editing that hardly lets us know what is going on does not help.<br /><br />It seems Marcus Nispel, who began his career as a film director with the 2003 version of \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\\" is specializing in remaking. \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" is the fifth work directed by Mr. Nispel, whose previous works include the 2004 made-for-TV film \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"Pathfinder,\\" a remake of a Norwegian movie, and the 2009 version of \\"Friday the 13th.\\" I have only seen two of them (\\"Texas\\" and \\"Friday\\"), and was not impressed. They are not terrible; they are just mediocre, just like the new \\"Conan\\" here.

0525423273|4.0|Anna and the French Kiss was an enjoyable read. I would have given this book 4.5 stars, if I could. This book is one of those that I can see turning into a popular chick-flick movie.<br /><br />It's told by Anna's POV, and we're inside her head as she leaves Atlanta to attend School of America in Paris (SOAP) after her father (who is a best selling author) decided it would be good for her to be on the other side of the world. Anna is the kind of character, that most girls can relate too. Being inside Anna's head was mostly humorous, then at times, you wish you weren't inside her head. Anna knows what she wants, and she'll go through anything to get it.<br /><br />While starting out in Paris, she befriends her neighbor, Meredith and her group of friends who consist of Rashmi, Josh and the wonderful St. Claire.<br /><br />St. Claire is swoon worthy in a gentlemanly sort of way. He's sweet, adorable, funny and he has a british accent (I have something with that accent) that Anna just falls in love for.  Anna falls for St. Claire while he helps her with speaking French, but there's two problems, Meredith also has fallen for St. Claire and, St. Claire has a girlfriend (dun dun dunn).<br /><br />Anna also left some people in Atlanta, her mother, her brother Sean, her best friend Bridgette and her soon-to-boyfriend Toph. Sean was an adorable little brother, I'd take him any day. The thing that happened between Bridgette and Toph wasn't surprising, to say the least, in the real world, that would've probably happened.<br /><br />There was alot of drama in this book, I noticed. Alot of crying (from Anna) and cheesy lines (St. Claire). I think that's what put me off with giving this book 5 stars. At times I just wanted to throw something at Anna for crying so much, she just cried at the most unresonable times.<br /><br />Other than that, this book was enjoyable, and did keep me entertained through-out. I enjoyed reading about a book that wasn't based in America, and Stephanie did a really good job with explaining and presenting this novel. The romance was awe-worthy and set at a resonable pace. The thoughts that were going through Anna's head were realistic. The ending was something I was satisfied to read.did a really good job with explaining and presenting this novel.

B007N0REX6|5.0|This is an incredible record.  Slash is at the top of his game.  Obviously he has found the right chemistry to produce what I believe is the best rock record in a long time.  Myles Kennedy is fantastic.  I love Alter Bridge, but I think Myles has found a greater and more creative collaboration here. Every track is fantastic, but if I have to pick a favorite it would be #8 Anastasia. This track is pure GNR nostalgia.  Myles is a much better singer than Axl Rose could ever hope to be. This seriously feels like it could be a GNR record. Buy this record it Rocks!
B001EC3JME|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3DYAA8Y0YWTRQ]]I own several flashlights with battery tube diameters ranging from one inch to 1 ½ inches.  I needed a belt holster to carry them and luckily I found this product.  I liked how it expanded to hold flashlights of various diameters but most of the ones that I will use it with are close to the same tube diameter for the battery power cells.  I don't hardly use many D cell flashlights any more as when I need a powerful light I use high intensity LED flashlights that use 18650 power cells that are rechargeable.<br /><br />Some of my flashlights can be long in that they can use three 18650 cells and I liked how this flashlight holster rotates  so you can wear a flashlight with a larger head and long battery tube more comfortably.  The ballistic nylon construction is nicely done and is rugged.  The rotating belt clip locks into 8 positions and it works well.<br /><br />The manufacturer claims that this holster will also hold C and D Cell flashlights.  I imaging it can but the fit would be very tight.  I would think that if you used a D size flashlight in the holster that it would then be useless for a smaller mini Maglite or 18650 power cell flashlights as it would be stretched and it would no longer hold the small flashlights securely.  I am also sure that you would have a difficult time inserting a D cell flashlight into the holster while wearing it.  It would have to be stretched quite a bit.<br /><br />For what I use it for I am extremely happy with it and I recommend it to you.  Please watch my video so you can get an impression of the holster and how I use it.  I hope the video is useful to you.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Like a lot of you, I bought the first book because it was a NYT bestseller. Less than 10 pages into it I wanted my money back. It took me almost two weeks to finish it and I spent most of the reading time smirking, gagging, snorting, convulsing and wondering how the Hell such an untalented, immature author could make the bestseller list with this drivel.<br /><br />I bought the first book and regretted the wasted money. A friend loaned me the second book and I skipped more pages than I read, hoping to see where Ana finally comes to her senses and dumps Grey or at least beats the shit out of him in his sleep. Never happened.  The friend that loaned me the second book also gave up on the trilogy and decided not to waste another $10 on the final book. The only way I am going to read the third book is if it shows up online somewhere, free.<br /><br />If I was the richest woman on Earth I would still refuse to pay money for this book. I will not reward a literary hack of the lowest order by adding to her undeserved wealth.<br /><br />And hey, I've found I can glean most of the story of book #3 from these reviews, without all the Oh. Oh no! Holy Crap! ad nauseum, and details of their depraved sex life.thanks!

0375714839|5.0|I realize it's a cliche, but the book is always better than the animated feature (which was excellent). Still, with The Complete Persepolis, I discovered so many depths that I missed in the film. One thing that was so cool was that even in repressive societies, such as Satrapi's revolution-era Iran, she was an Iron Maiden fan like me. There's always something hopeful about the youth in these cultures, that they always find a way to flout the rules. It's an eye-opening glimpse into a world few of us in the West truly know much about, save for what we're shown on television news--which is always suspect.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that I own an e-reader, this was a book that just had to be savored physically, and I enjoyed every beautifully illustrated page.<br /><br />Marjane's struggles as a young woman are universal. All young women worry about fitting in, about doing what's \\"expected\\", about whether they're going to find the right \\"one\\". We often wander in this search for self and find ourselves lost. It happens in Los Angeles Like most human beings we're often our own worst critics. I cheered at Marjane's bravery for speaking out against over-thr-top strictures concerning the veil and other things. It was both hilarious and humbling, when one considers that she could have been killed for being so outspoken. In fact, many of her family and friends had been jailed/killed for even smaller acts of \\"defiance\\".<br /><br />An illustrated novel such as this with these universal themes set against the backdrop of war, repression and state-sanctioned murder once again makes me wonder why there are authors who have no problems crafting vampires and werewolves, but can't seem to grasp the universalism of human beings of varying hues.<br /><br />My favorite character by far is Marjane's grandmother. Much like grandmothers of every stripe, shade and size, she is a fountain of great wisdom, strength and comfort. So glad that I finally got around to reading this. Go Iron Maiden!iden!

0345803485|1.0|Horrible writing.  Incredibly overrated.  Subject matter is 'vanilla' and lame for anyone over twelve years old.<br />The same phrases are repeated over and over.  No originality, wit or humor were involved in the making of this book.
B008578PRK|2.0|The movie was full of predictable situations.  Daniel Radcliffe was a lifeless character encountering a mysterious ghost who's intention seems to be centered on the proper burial/reunion with her son.  I gave it a two star only for the movie set location.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I LOVED this book. I will have to say I wasn't as captured at first because of the blatancy of what was happening but then it twisted and twisted again and again.

0525423281|4.0|I read Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins as an audiobook. I started Perkins' other book, Anna and the French Kiss, before I started Lola, but was having a hard time getting into it. Once I started reading/listening to Lola, I didn't stop for two days. The reason is simple: Lola is more likeable than Anna.<br /><br />Granted, there are plenty of things that make Lola a flawed character. She lies frequently in order to keep the peace -- with her dads, with her friends, her boyfriend, etc. On the one hand, it's admirable that she cares enough about these people to protect their feelings, but Lola tells some selfish lies as well. Regardless of her flaws, Lola is interesting. I had a hard time caring about Anna because she's very girl-next-door, almost blandly so, but Lola (ironically) is anything but.<br /><br />Lola is a budding costume designer, and since she was a little girl she has lived every day of her life in costume. She dresses up as characters, themes, inanimate objects -- all tastefully, of course. She's over-the-top, with wigs, makeup, and a self-made wardrobe comprised of recycled and repurposed garments from thrift stores. She's one of those fascinating creative types, and hearing about her wardrobe projects/inspiration brought new levels of depth and fun to the narrative. She would seem superficial if her plans for the future didn't revolve around designing costumes for theatre -- she's practicing for adulthood.<br /><br />Joining Lola as she navigates first love are her parents, Nathan and Andy, her birth mother/aunt Nora, best friend and sleuth Lucy, boyfriend/rocker Max, and boy-next-door Cricket Bell. Each of them is well developed and distinct, teaching Lola that love isn't always easy, the ideal lover might not be the right lover, and that breaking up is hard to do.<br /><br />As an audiobook narrator, Shannon McManus does a good job of bringing the voice of teenaged Lola to life. I had a giggle the first time the word panniers came up, though, with flat American pronunciation. Can't win `em all, I guess.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a fun, light YA contemporary. It's a well-paced, balanced story with endearing characters and a memorable protagonist. Give it a try on your next rainy day at home. I guarantee Lola will bring a little sunshine into you life.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because I heard a woman in the hair salon talking about how the book was SO good that since the sequel was sold out, she bought a Kindle just to get the sequel.  So I thought, it has to be good, right?  WRONG.  Now, in fairness, I only made it about 1/4 through the book so if the last 75% is outstanding (which it doesn't sound like it is from the other reviews), then maybe this review isn't accurate.  It is so poorly written, I totally agree with the other reviewer that stated she checked to see if the author was a teenager.  I think this book is only so successful because it is \\"trendy\\" and therefore a socially acceptable way for mommies to read porn.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of my favorites of John Green. This book will make you cry your eyes out, but changes you in an amazing way. MUST READ!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible. Very easy to use. Finding passages is very easy. l like being able to adjust text size.  would like to see a background change to a softer white instead of black.
B002UXRGM0|4.0|The series is very impressive, and although I still have a few more episodes to go, I'd say that BBC's other take, Planet Earth, seemed to have more content and just as much 'wow' factor.
B000068CNX|5.0|It arrived very fast! So far, the discs are playing fine with no skips and no scratches were on the discs. It also arrived in full packaging. Very happy about this product!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Me and my son live this game because it's just like Mario but with a little Irish fella! Two thumbs up!
B00785P2QC|4.0|im onlynposting this for the free stuff. the game is fun but its no fun spending real money on virtual games. anyway. hhhhhhhhhh
B0086700CM|5.0|i am obsessed  with this game. i would  play  it on my friends iphones and beat their high score. once i start playing i cant stop. ITS AN ADDICTION!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very simple concept that turns out to be an excellent way to kill a few minutes. ads aren't intrusive and everything works smoothly.
034580404X|4.0|I love these books.  I have only had them a short while and I am almost finished with #3.  This is the first erotics that I've read but I hope E.L. James writes more because I am hooked.  They are very hard to put down.  I love them and I am sharing them with everyone.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|If you buy the full version does your game data from the free version transfer? If anyone could shed some light on this question it would be an immense help. (on the kindle fire)
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|I bought this album knowing that it would be good and it was. Bob Marleys music is a classic that never fails.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is in a word fantastic. The story is gripping and really keeps you reading. This is one of my favorite books.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|Like Blues Deluxe, this effort is Joe going to the music he loves and making it his own. The best track of the album is an updated version of Jimmy Barnes' \\"Too Much Ain't Enough Love.\\" Joe's takes on \\"Stones In My Passway\\" and \\"Who's Been Talking?\\" are awesome. As for the rest of the album, Joe does what he does best in being the best playing Blues today.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Despite all the hype, I did not expect the like this novel since I don't usually read ya or dystopian novels. But I loved it! The characters are very well written, as is the plot and the setting. The story line is dynamic and keeps you turning the pages. I am not going to summarize the plot, as this has been done by other reviewers. Suffice it to say, if you haven't read Hunger Games yet, read it!
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|I can listen to this CD almost the whole way through without skipping songs. I am amazed at how many great artists are featured, like: Nicki Minaj, Flo Rida, Taio Cruz, Usher, Akon, Ludacris, Chris Brown, Snoop Dogg and the list goes on! It's like a lineup of all my favorite artists! I particularly like these songs for either running or dancing.
B0052T7KDO|5.0|Rory Gallagher is the greatest Irish Blues Rock musical artist ever. From \\"Bad Penny,\\" to \\"Philby,\\" on on through \\"Off the Handle,\\" these legendary tracks have inspired countless musicians playing today. As for the quality of sound, it sounds like the music was recorded yesterday.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a fun game. A good brain teaser. it makes you think the more levels you move up. Fun for all ages.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I was happy to find this movie on a DVD.  I still have the original on the VHS and was afraid it would break someday.  This classic movie should be preserved forever so no one forgets the horror of Faceism and Marxism. I wanted my grandchildren to see what happens to people under a demon spirit led dictator.  If we are not forewarned, Satan will raise up another such dictator and our wonderful American dream will be caught and bound in this nightmare.  Millions of innocent people will die a horrible death as they did in Nazi Germany.  Families must educate their young people about this horror.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Amazing! I absolutely love that you can watch the videos you've downloaded without any wifi! I've looked for an app like this forever. You won't be disappointed! ;)
B00129H7VS|5.0|Not only does Band of Brothers best any war movie ever made, it's the best film, TV show, or mini series of all-time. Completely mesmerizing, and it sticks with you forever.
0307592731|4.0|Cheryl Strayed's Wild is simply a great read. The story has two parallel plot components - her actual backpacking trip and her personal journey. Both parts are constructed with honest, blunt detail that will pull the reader into the story. My only complaint is a somewhat minor one. I sometimes found myself distracted by the author's tone, which to me implied that she believed her situation was exceptional. Her personal tribulations are heart-wrenching, to be sure, but they are certainly not unique nor are they beyond the realm of the tragedy of ordinary people. Indeed, I think that because her hardships are, in some ways, quite common, the reader will identify with her situation and become fully engulfed in her story of finding strength.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|This movie The Lost Boys is my favorite vampire movie of all time so far.  Noting I have seen ranks up there with the one liners, humor, horror, and the music is amazing.  I have watched it mutiple times threwout the years, I never ever get tired of watching it.<br />Plus added benifit was the bonus material on the discs.  So if you love yourself a classic horror vampire movie, with great preformances and great special effects then pick this movie up and be amazed at a great horror movie.  With it having horror, humor, little drama, and tons of action scenes.  You wont be sorry.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|The 2 lead characters would never have dated much less \\"been engaged\\". They were so mis-matched that the premise of a wedding was UNbelievable anyway.Owen Wilson was wasted because he was merely a body-double for Woody Allen. The writing was childish- not even good at a fairy tale level- & the interesting people from the 1920's were basically foils for Woody's dream of being able to go back in time and suggest ideas to them that they then would be remembered for in the future.(or so the lead character could use his inside infomation from the past to win arguments in the present) Quite the fantasy and not a bad idea but poorly realized in this movie.I think this movie was made BY Woody Allen FOR Woody Allen & that too could be OK If the writing and acting were better. The opening is a love letter to Paris and it is beautiful & the first half of the movie was....... tolerable but then it became a repetetive waste of time. And a giant boring cliche. Yikes what a let down after having this movie recommended to me by some friends and reading all of the glorious reviews in entertainment magazines. Did they see the same movie??  Made me sad because I wanted to like this movie and I really really did not enjoy it. Neither did my husband. He came up with the \\"annoyingly neurotic\\" phrase. You expect some of that with almost any Woody project but this was over the top..........Owen WAS Woody as much as he could be &  he did a great job with the vocal inflections and hand mannerisms but the movie could have been so much better if he had been allowed to use his own persona or create a new one for his character. But even then the whiny, petulant, little boy lost routine might have de-railed any actor in this role. 2 stars because it wasn't horrible but it could have been SO much better.I won;t watch it again it won;t be in my permanent movie collection.
B00005J73X|4.0|This was a very good live CD but I just didn't care for the songs Something to believe in because of certain lryics on the song as it was sung.  Also I didn't really enjoy the song I don't like monday's.  But to me rest of the CD rock because it had most of the hits all on one live CD.  I think if your a true Bon Jovi fan like myself, then pick this live CD up, then also buy the CD called Cross Roads which has the main hits all on one greatest hits album.  Then between the live CD and the greatest hits CD you have the whole set of Bon Jovi.  Then you can sit back and relax plus enjoy song after song of their music.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my mom has this on her I pad and I was thinking, I want this on my kindle but they don't have it.  it was like the amozon people read my mind because the next day, BAM they had it.  I really love this app.  and joker don't like many things.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I have to say I actually enjoy this movie.  Hugh Jackman did the movie really good in my viewpoint, plus Kate Beckinsale was very entertaining preformance as the princess.  It had enough plot line for a good movie, this movie basically ends up being a love it or hate it movie as I call certain movies.  It had enough chessy parts to make for a mindless entertainment value.  Just remeber to keep an open mind while watching certain movies, some might end up surpising you just like this movie did for me.  It was better then imagne it could have been.  Plus I enjoy certain horror movies anyways, and most live up to the hype.  So if you need a good laugh and some good speical effects then pick this movie up and enjoy some good lines and action scenes.  Then after watching it make up your own mind about if you like it or didn't like it.
044042335X|5.0|As usual Lee Child delivered another great Jack Reacher story.  For some reason, I found this one a little slow getting into but that could have just been me.  By the time I was a couple of chapters in, I was hooked and enjoyed the book.  I can always count on a Reacher novel to keep my interest.  I'd highly  recommend this book - or any Jack Reacher book - to anyone that likes murder/mystery/action type books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Entertaining, challenging and fascinating .  Haven't had any difficulties with the program.  Love the bright colors and new challenges with each level.
0307352145|5.0|\\"Quiet\\" by Susan Cain is brilliantly done in explaining the introverted self.  She starts the book by giving a brief history lesson on the rise of \\"the extroverted ideal\\".  At the turn of the 19th century the \\"rise of the Culture of Personality\\" took hold among the American population.  Infatuation of movie stars, and advertising only hastened the change from the \\"culture of character\\" to that of personality.<br /><br />The author delves into the different aspects of life where the extroverted ideal reigns.  She shows how the ideal touches on the entire school life from pre-school through college.  Also, how the ideal is prevalent in the work place.  After showing examples of the ideal and how it touches most every part of our life, she goes into the biological studies on the introverted mind.<br /><br />Author Susan Cain stays away from the in depth medical terms, which makes this portion an easy read.  She includes studies that are not only short term in nature, i.e. brain scans, but also long term studies that started  with infants and concluded when they were college students.  She then devotes a chapter on how the introverted mind can go beyond itself and stretch its boundaries.<br /><br />The final part of the book the author offers suggestions on how to love and how to work.  She offers some advice on both personal relationships and work relationships.  The biggest point she drove home was for an introvert to find their quiet time.<br /><br />This book is wonderfully put together, Susan Cain touches on so many different aspects of the introverted life/mind while not getting too technical in her descriptions.  This book is excellent for both the extroverts as well as introverts we all meet.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone in a leadership position.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is not a game for little kids unless you turn off in game purchases. I play without gem purchases and do fine. You start with a small restaurant and you make drinks and snacks for your customers. You use coins and/or gems to pay for decorations, expansions,  and new equipment. It is completely &quot;possible&quot; to play the game without gem purchases; but it requires self control. Some items for purchase are only for gems but they are not mandatory to play,  if you want a certain design or you can't wait for your food to finish, you &quot;pay&quot; tor it. You will earn a gem at level 2 and 4 of each item. Different equipment will have different items to make. As you expand your floorspace or build certain items you, will need to add neighbors. That is easy to do,  just post a message on your own message page with your id,  add people who post on you board,  post yours on someone board after you tip them. Or just scan through the review page for ID plugs. Mine is &quot;attrya&quot; on restaurant and bakery you can add me if you need a neighbor.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great way to keep from boredom. Love to pass time with this game! Not very challenging, but great for.passing time!

B0042RUMH8|5.0|Some people criticize Jennifer for doing everything. What that don't seem to understand is that she does everything well. Yes, she is not Celine Dion (Who can be?), but that doesn't mean this album isn't fun and exhilirating. I've listened to it more times then I can count and it's addicting. The only song I'm not sure about is 'Run the World', however I'm also comparing it to Beyonce's 'Run the World' (Probably not a good idea to compare Jennifer to Beyonce. They don't even sing the same style of music). However, my favorites are long and many 'Good Hit', 'I'm Into You', 'Papi' (The reason I bought the album), 'Until it Beats No More', 'One Love', 'Invading My Mind', 'Starting Over', and 'Hypnotico'.<br />If you decide to buy the deluxe edition I highly recommend it. It includes the fabulous 'Everybody's Girl' and 'Charge Me Up' ('Take Care' is good, but more for a die hard Jennifer Lopez fan), and 'Ven A Bailar'. It's 'On the Floor' in Spanish, and for some reason it's even better then the orginal in English. Maybe Jennifer and Pitbull should always sing in Spanish. This is a one of a kind album, and the best dance music put out by a mainstream artist in a long time.
0345803493|5.0|i absolutely love this! Was worth the money spent, would buy again & look forward to the third book! Very happy with my purchase & shipping was very quick.
B00338QENI|5.0|Wonderful, eye-opening, educational piece of work. It reads like a novel, while educating the reader of the atrocities of the past. I couldn't put it down.
034580404X|5.0|Great series. Read all 3 in 6 days. I couldn't put them down! The only thing that I could complain about are the sex scenes. They get old and repetitive. I started skipping them because I was more interested in the love story than the sexual aspect of it.
B0083EM24C|5.0|After the excellent first LP \\"Manners\\", \\"Gossamer\\" is another home run from Passion Pit. It's not really better, nor is it any worse. It's a continuation of what we loved on \\"Manners\\" and the band delivered it just as well. By that, I mean well-crafted songs that melt together Michael Angelakos' falsetto, electro beats, bass guitars, and pop melodies effectively.  I wouldn't say any of the songs on \\"Gossamer\\" are bad. It's a strong LP from start to finish.<br /><br />Along with fun., Foster The People, and Grouplove, Passion Pit is part of a wave of recent bands that combine the aesthetics of indie music with upbeat pop. Its music that is not as bland as some pop is, but also not as challenging as indie music often is.  Unlike the mentioned bands, Passion Pit hasn't any top 40 success. That should change, because Passion Pit is even better.<br /><br />\\"Gossamer\\" is a personal album that reflects Angelakos' recent struggles, as well as joys. Most of the songs are upbeat and danceable, even when they exhibit a negative mood. It's a modern sounding album with 80s influences, sometimes 70s.  \\"Take A Walk\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"Constant Conversations\\", \\"Cry Like A Ghost\\", and \\"Hideway\\" are my five favorite songs on the album.  \\"Take A Walk\\" does something I've never heard an indietronica track do - address socio-economic problems. \\"Constant Conversations\\" combine indie pop and classic soul. Angelako' falsetto sounds amazing on it.  \\"Carried Away\\" is a 80s new wave revival that impossible not to dance to. \\"Hideway\\" has a power-pop sound and reminds me a bit of The Killers.<br /><br />Seeing Passion Pit in concert is on my bucket list of things to do.
1469984202|5.0|If you are reading this, then the title of my review has done it's job & I am glad for it.  Having cut my teeth on the works of Asimov, Clarke, Niven, Bradbury, Heinlein, etc, it has been a bit of a challenge to find more modern authors who have the ability to tell a story rich in character development, gripping story, imaginative, yet believable.<br /><br />So, since book reviews are meant to guide the next possible reader, let me cut to the chase first, and then I will go to work on the review of the books:<br /><br />******* BUY THIS SERIES NOW! *******<br /><br />Do not waste your time trying the sample, just go ahead and buy all of the works in the WOOL collection (six, as of this writing) right now.<br /><br />If you do not buy them all, and you find yourself without an internet connection and you just finished reading one of the books and you know there are others available you will be extremely annoyed, distracted, pi$$ed off, etc till you get the next one & start reading it.<br /><br />Having read hundreds of books, many in the SciFi genre, but also many biographies, and historical works (european & british history especially) I was absolutely blown away by the Wool books.  To be completely honest, I almost put the book down maybe 30 pages into it. I was on vacation on an amazing little island off the coast of North Carolina, no cars, no distractions except miles of beaches & ocean waves when I searched on my Kindle for some Science Fiction to read over the 15 days I was away.  Since I often read SciFi books that are based well in the future, take place off-earth, etc, I was not really prepared for the way Wool opened. It was dark, depressing, and not what I thought I wanted on my vacation with the sun shining and the seagulls singing and the waves crashing on the sand. But I stuck with it, and that is why I am here today, writing this.<br /><br />First of all lets backup for a second and talk about the name of the book. WOOL. You wear it (sometimes).  Butit has numerous other uses, including, apparently, as the name of a book.  I didn't know what to even make of it.  I mean look at most of the titles under SciFi, & you get the space war sagas, the alien invasions, the boy-meets-space travel stories, etc....  But WOOL?? I couldnt fathom it would be a book that would interest me for very long, and so I again reveal how mistaken I can be.  Important Lesson learned? : Dont judge a book by it's cover, nor by it's NAME.<br /><br />One of the many great yet very subtle parts of this work is when you actually connect the name WOOL with the line in the story that reveals the connection.  It's not too far into book 1 and you know what, you might not even catch it, and it might not mean much to you- but it did, for some reason, to me.<br /><br />It brought home to me that Hugh Howey had put me in a place that seemed at first to be so incomprehensible, but later came to be seen as a very possible, plausible place not so far removed as to be unimaginable, yet still so staggering in it's implications.<br /><br />If WOOL had only been the short, single work of book 1, I would have been upset that it wasnt taken further, or approached it's potential.  In fact, I didn't know there were more books at first and I really was upset. I thought \\"WOW- SO MUCH POTENTIAL, this was an amazing story, but look where it ended!?\\"  And then I checked back on Amazon and saw the remaining books and grabbed them all (hence my earlier suggestion to do the same).<br /><br />Without spoiling the story for those of you who have not yet started, I do want to say that this is one of the most fascinating, smart, stop-for-a-second-and-say- `Oh my god!' reads I have ever picked up.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the way I first tried to figure out where this was taking place.  Was it on earth?  Somewhere else?  When?  How did it come to be...?  Did any of that matter...?  As I read on, and parts of those questions were  answered I was very very pleased with the depth of the story, and so glad that there wasn't a flaky, thin, all-is-revealed at once to put it all together for me.  It came together carefully, methodically, and at just the right pace.<br />The fact that the characters in WOOL are just people, with no super abilities, paranormal talents, etc, makes them all the more important to the way you see them move through the story.<br /><br />While all of the books were gripping to me, I particularly enjoyed the flashbacks to see how it all came about.  Without spoiling this particular part, I will just say that it was extremely well done and has some fantastic but subtle connections between the characters and story that could easily be missed.  A great example of this: A sister of a congressman only gets mentioned briefly and almost as an aside in passing during a brief conversation, yet later you realize the implications of the circumstances and again have another \\"WOW\\" moment.<br /><br />Yes,  I realize that was pretty vague, but trust me on it.  If you miss it, my apologies, if you get it, no other comment is required..;)<br /><br />Well, this is by far the longest review I have ever written and I still feel like it is not even close to being as compelling and passionate as I had envisioned it when I decided it had to be done.  But in closing just a couple of things to say:  No doubt, this is a book I will read many times over, and as another reviewer summed it up so well, I only wish I could read it again for the first time.<br /><br />Will it become a movie?  I don't know, but I hope so, but ONLY if it can be done well (an example of what it should NOT be like: Steven King 'The Stand' book vs. movie.  The movie was an insult to the book in my opinion).  The Scott brothers certainly have the ability to do it right.  I actually care less about the movie possibilities than the fact that the deal may help Mr. Howey devote more time to writing!  We will see....  Regardless of the outcome of the motion picture issue,I hope that Mr. Howey keeps this series going for a long time.  I do understand that talented authors, artists, actors, musicians, etc need to move on and create new works and new characters and new stories, but the selfish part of me hopes this story will keep intriguing us and challenging us for years to come in new installments and characters and situations.  The foundation exists in as solid a form as possible.<br /><br />In my opinion this is already a classic work of fiction, here to stay, and Mr. Howey should feel extremely pleased to be in this stratosphere of talent that comes along so rarely.  These books will be talked about in classrooms, in living rooms, family rooms, bookstores, etc for a long time to come and I really hope you will enjoy them as much as I have.

B004OR199G|4.0|This book is funny, it's emotional and it's inspirational! And if you are looking for being inspired and don't care about some irregularities - just go for it! But if you are like me and you care about both style and facts being true - maybe try some other book. Kris is somehow \\"creative\\" with the facts and statistics:<br /><br />\\"He &lt;Michael Pollan> reports that in 1960, 18 percent of out national income was spent on food while 5 percent was spent on health care. Today 9 percent of our income is spent on food and 17 percent on health care. &lt;Emotional, but not truthful conclusion> Clearly, the less we spend on food, the more we spend on health care.\\"<br /><br />The thing here is that technological progress in last 60 years made food much cheaper. And health care became more expensive. \\"The less we spend on food\\" means nothing in this context.<br /><br />People die from cancer more because many lethal deceases from last century are now curable, so statistically we see more cancer fatalities.<br /><br />The book is full of conclusions that are emotional, beautiful, but just not true. So just read it, enjoy the style and don't try to analyze - this will destroy all the magic!
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|My fear with this one is that Daniel Radcliffe wouldn't be able to convince me he wasn't Harry Potter. How wrong I was! The character he plays is such a departure from Harry Potter that I didn't even think about it after the first 10 minuets or so. I also have to say that Mr. Radcliffe is such a great actor. I never really paid much attention to the acting in Harry Potter - that wasn't what I watched those movies for anyway... But I think Radcliffe has really proven that he's a great actor with this one.<br /><br />This is one of the better \\"horror\\" movies that I've seen in a while. It used sound and light to create suspense, while the story was being built up. There were quite a few \\"jumpy\\" moments, which even though I was expecting them got me. My dog even woke up with a start twice.<br /><br />The story was pretty good. A young man must go to a village where he's unwelcome and while there he uncovers their secret. As he's putting the pieces of the puzzle together children in the village start dying. The young lawyer is trying to figure how all this connects together while he accepts the hospitality of one of the wealthy families in the village. The wife appears to be a bit crazy, but she does help put some fire into plot.<br /><br />The only reason this did not receive a 5 star rating was the ending. It wasn't a horrible ending, but I was expecting something different. After the puzzle is \\"figured out\\" I thought that would be the end. But the ending is much more sinister than I would have imagined.<br /><br />I would have to say despite the PG-13 rating that it shouldn't be watched by younger kids. I think I would have to say 15 or 16 rather than 13 as the appropriate age limit. There's some graphic scenes, although they aren't necessarily violent they are disturbing none the less. There's not much in the way of strong language, I honestly don't remember any but it could have just slipped my mind.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a wonderful app. I've got it on my KF and it works great. But spend the extra $.99 and get the ZPREMIUM version. The added backgiround sounds make a world of difference. Either way I'm sure you 'll be happy with it!

B004CLYKLI|5.0|Actually, I loved this book. Amidst all the horrified reactions to Ms. Chua's writing, the point seems to be missed that in the end she lightens up, so to speak, and realizes that she has been pretty extreme in pushing her children to excellence. Also, there is a self-deprecating tone/humor throughout that shows she is  well aware of how manic she is being in the pursuit of such excellence and achievement in her offspring.<br />I did find it a refreshing antidote to the slacker, condescending style of typical American parenting found nowadays, where huge accolades are heaped on children for merely breathing in and out. The lesson of the book, leading to some moderation in the end is that more should be expected of children, instead of just letting them \\"do their own thing\\" for 24 hours a day (and then applauding the result, or non-result, as it were). I have to wonder how much of the outrage is due to some guilt by parents on being too lazy at the other extreme, and trying to justify that.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Book was a waste of $$. I bought all three at once because so many people recommended it. Its boring.
B00785P2QC|4.0|my dislikes of the game is the badgering to post on facebook consistantly. and the need to purchase credit in order to progress in the game. not to crazy about it being a continuous game. like how the others were leveled. aside from that, like the game a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|i am disappointed the first two were probably the best books i have read but the third??? I feel like many others that the tried book was just sloppily and lazily done collins made several pointless deaths and i felt she did that just to get closer to the ending the first two i also felt let down because the narrator of a story is not going two die the first two books 5 stars this one 1 star
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome could do without the adds tho but still the game is pretty fun and still its awesome
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have to say, this is the easiest, user friendly Bible app i have used so far. I'm sure there are others that can add several commentaries, dictionaries and the like, but this offers so much for the average person wanting to enjoy reading and studying the Bible. Several Bible studios to choose from and shareable features. Awesome resource!

B000FUF6QS|4.0|When horror movies are done right, they are a wonderous thing.  The problem is this isn't what I or apparently many others would deem a horror movie but it's still wonderful.  Though this originally came out in 1973, I only saw it recently and probably would have passed it by except for having seen the remake starring Nicolas Cage (which I kind of liked)and was a little curious about the original. The plotline is fairly simple, there is a missing girl on a Scottish isle and Sergeant Howie, a policeman from the mainland comes to investigate.  The people who inhabit the island are polite and seem like ordinary folk except it's apparant they are giving Howie the runaround.  While I would label this film more of a mystery, I would also label it a musical.  If you like folk music with a Celtic edge, you will love the music in this film.  There are some tunes in this film that I just can't get out of my head (and I mean that in a very good way) like Willow's Song, Gently Johnny and Cornrigs.  This is defintely worth viewing.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|enjoyable and fun as is. some preset quests you may have already done pop up in story line but by then you may have spent your currency or reached level daily limit. however you earn money fast and level fast and for most instances it credits you or lets you play practice mini games to count. it is also vert addicting and fun!

B0045HCJKS|3.0|Written and directed by Michael Crichton, Westworld revolves around the concept of a distant-future amusement resort. Spending their time in one of three fully-functional, authentic sets, guests are free to live out their life-long fantasies as a wild west cowboy, medieval knight or indulgent Roman elite while a convincing, lifelike cyborg supporting cast absorbs punishment and boosts egos. The big selling points are that anything goes and nobody gets hurt, but when a park-wide malfunction grants free will to the robots, those guarantees are immediately called into question. It's a fun premise, on par with some of the era's better sci-fi concepts, but spends too much time dilly-dallying and vainly soaking up the atmosphere when it should be advancing the plot. That gives the impression that, like so many Philip Dick properties, it doesn't really know what to do with itself after the ground rules are established. Crichton's work in the director's chair leaves a lot to be desired, but he doesn't get much help from the film's hammy, made-for-TV quality special effects. Most of that can be attributed to the age of the picture, but it's tough to take the drama seriously when folks bleed neon red. Yul Brynner turns in some quality work as the ruthless, stone-faced lead cyborg, but the rest of the cast is droll, vanilla and forgettable. Too much frosting, not enough cake.

B004XWLN20|1.0|So the packaging sucks... 'nuff said about that...<br /><br />The series itself only had about a single good season of episodes worth watching, maybe two.  If you put all the good episodes together that were about Clark finding out who he was and then finally becoming Superman, then 80% of the series is trash.  All the others, especially in the first half of the series, are of him saving his friends, mostly Lana Lange, who is ALWAYS in danger.  It was very irritating to see such a great cast go to waste over and over again with such horrible stories.  It got better near the end with the addition of Lois Lane, Erica Durance, who is 30,000 times a better actress and hotter than anyone else on the show.  I still felt satisfaction when he ripped the front of his shirt in the last ten minutes of the last episode and the classic John Williams score for Superman came up, but having to endure ten years of stand alone, horribly acted, episodes of nonsense was way too much.  Really, what moron would stay in love with someone like Lana, who is ALWAYS trying to get herself killed and then just leaves him anyway.  Kind of pathetic, just like most of this series.

0307887448|5.0|This book is one of my top 10 reads over the last decade.  I do not recall enjoying any Sci-fi book this much since Orson Scott Card's \\"Enders Game\\".<br /><br />I had some concerns going in, because the synopsis makes something of the fact that the book contains a lot of quirky 80's references, and normally camp for it's own sake does not appeal to me, and I was nervous that this book would be one long yawn inducing inside joke.  It proved to be anything but.<br /><br />Make no mistake - the 80s references are there, but so is a protagonist (Wade) that immediately captures our sympathy as a seemingly hopeless overweight underdog whose future living in the \\"stacks\\" looks gloomy until he takes hold of an opportunity to win a contest that would set him up for life.<br /><br />The Oasis is vividly painted in this story as a huge virtual world of all kinds of scenarios, including D & D adventures, Arcades, Night Clubs, as well as places for work and living.  Throughout the story the theme of an alternate reality is always present, as the earth has been so devastated by various events that the Oasis is seen as the only route to happiness for many.<br /><br />The tech references did get me I admit, since I grew up in that era, so I got and enjoyed most of the references to semi-obscure 80's trivia in the book.  But the book also succeeded in creating romantic tension with Wade's friend in the Oasis  - Art3mis.<br /><br />If you are even a mild fan of sci-fi and of good writing in general, you will enjoy this book.

B008BRC6NS|4.0|My review for those who are new to Jennifer Lopez's music: Get this collection. All of the songs on it are really good and you shouldn't pay attention to my minor nitpicking details, because this is definitely the best way to get familiar with her music.<br /><br />My review for those who are already Jennifer Lopez fans: I'll start off with the bad. First off, who made the track listing for this? The order the songs are in seems completely random and doesn't exactly flow well. It would have had a better flow to it if the songs were in chronological order. Some of her biggest hits, \\"Play,\\" the Track Masters Remix of \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright,\\" and \\"I'm Glad,\\" are missing, while minor hits like \\"I'm Into You\\" and \\"Feelin' So Good\\" rest comfortably on the standard track listing. Not to mention the 2 week #1 hit \\"All I Have\\" is only a bonus track on the deluxe version, while it should be on all editions. In the booklet and back cover, \\"Jenny From the Block\\" and \\"Feelin' So Good\\" are labeled as remixes while they are, in fact, the original album versions. The version of \\"Get Right\\" used on this album is the version featuring two raps by Fabulous, however I'm fairly sure the main version of the song without a rapper tacked on was the more popular version.<br /><br />All complaints aside, this is not a bad collection. Many criticize Jennifer as an artist, but she sure knows how to pick her songs, even if she doesn't write the majority of them, or have the strongest voice. All of the songs included here are pop gold (except the new song \\"Goin' In,\\" which as of right now I don't care for), and have glamorous videos to go along with them. The DVD looks and sounds great. Although they made the mistake of putting the Fabulous version of \\"Get Right\\" on the CD, the music video on the DVD is thankfully the original version in which Jennifer plays all the different characters. Still, the DVD doesn't hold a candle to [[ASIN:B0000DJZ83 Jennifer Lopez - The Reel Me (DVD & CD)]], but it'snice to finally have her newer videos. The booklet (of the deluxe edition, at least) is very glossy, and features 24 very colorful pages of pretty much every photo from her CD booklets from On the 6 to Brave, as well as a few extra shots. If you haven't seen the booklets, you wouldn't know which pictures came from which album era, because this woman does not age!<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent collection. It could have been much better, but it also could have been much worse. If you are a casual Jennifer Lopez fan, particularly one that doesn't own all of her albums, I recommend this set.

B000FA5TTW|5.0|This is a great book. I saw the movie first and expected them to be similar. The book however is much more brutal in the description of the attack. I love the book but did not expect it to be so graphic and brutal. They really softened it down for the movie. If you don't have a weak stomach and can handle the brutality it is a great book.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I have been eagerly awaiting the porting of this game since getting my Kindle Fire in Nov. I have played previous iterations on XBox Live and the iPhone. this version seems to suffer from very peculiar end-game scoring. Human leads disappear into thin air while the AI miraculously recovers in game after game.<br />It was only about a month in that began to suspect that the fix was in and that I was beingplayed like some gullible hick at a dishonest carnival. I experienced this when trying to complete certain achievements.<br />So I wanted to ask other players if they have experienced this or if I'm just a crummy player.
0060936223|5.0|One of the funnest and most moving books I've read in a long time. Has a very light, self-effacing touch, even as she's grappling with big questions of art and life, and building a fascinating picture of the scene(s) she and Mapplethorpe emerged from. Gosh do I love her.
B0017I1IZA|3.0|I've been reading the Stephanie Plum series all summer. At first I loved it. I literally found myself laughing out loud at many parts and getting tangled in the love triangle that comes along with Stephanie's life. However, I feel like by the 8th book there should be some growth and change.<br /><br />I am about a quarter of the way through this book and already I feel as if I know everything that will happen to Stephanie. The story never changes, she always \\"loses\\" her man, there is always some annoying character that follows her around, the love triangle never ends, and someone always wants to kill her. I'd like to see some growth and change and see her become better at her job. However, I know there are at least 10 more books in this series and I don't know if there is growth and change, but I'm sure I won't stick around to find out.<br /><br />I loved these books in the beginning, which is the reason it only took me 3 months so far to get through 7 (almost 8) books. This may be the last one I read, sadly.

B001UAX56A|5.0|Lauryn Hill was so far ahead of her time when this most popular, genre mixed Cd was released.  It was a \\"must\\" have then and now required to have a complete Cd library.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|This CD starts with the first 2 singles; \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\", who are two strong tracks. Then the title track \\"Clockkwork Angels\\" is even better with his catchy melody. Then it's followed by some tracks that shows some interesting moments, but the songwriting is not as strong as the first three tracks.We have to wait for the song \\"The Wreckers\\" to see some more inspiring music, where the band is more focused on developing their ideas, instead of following their instincts. \\"Headlong Flight\\" is the third single and is another heavy song that is very enjoyable. \\"Wish them Well\\" is the weakest tracks of the CD. And the standout track is at the end, with \\"The Garden\\", showing the band going in a different direction, with a powerful ballad with classical arrangements, a nice piano break that is the entry to the beautiful Alex's guitar solo. The lyrics are really perfect here, matching the music very well, to release all the emotions.<br /><br />The musicianship on this CD is flawless, no surprise coming from this old band. But i really think that Geddy Lee is stealing the show with his bass sound throughout this CD. His sound was high in the mix , so we can appreciate all the nuances of his playing. As for the influences of the music with previous material, all this being purely accidental, and subjective, i would say that this is a logic evolution of Snakes and Arrows in terms of music style, but very different on the composition level. But it's obvious that the band sound is closer to their hard rock style of Fly By Night and 2112, then the sound of their progressive era after those 2 CDS. The band is now making heavy prog that as more to do with hard rock then prog, which is like they were returning to their roots since the \\"Counterparts\\"'s CD<br /><br />In conclusion, Clockwork Angels is a little stronger then Snakes and Arrows, but there also some inconsistency in the quality level of compositions in the middle of the CD. It's a solid work, but this is not your classic \\"Moving Pictures\\".
0439023513|2.0|It was a shame that the pacing of this novel was all over the place. Parts of it were very technical and dragged and then others important scenes that were rushed. Key scenes seemed to abruptly end with Katniss passing out (surely there is another way of wrapping up a scene or getting the character to another location?) But my biggest disappointment centered around the fact that character development in \\"Mockingjay\\" was largely sacrificed to relentlessly push a war-is-hell message which caused the plot to circle aimlessly. And the conclusion of the love triangle was unsatisfying for me as well, it felt like a cop out.
0061726834|4.0|I loved the concept behind this book. The idea of love being a sickness that ultimately causes ones death and needs to be cured was one I just loved. There was a part of me that wondered just how an entire society could suddenly make such a shift in thought about love, and it did feel like that background wasn't developed enough, but Oliver did make up for that in showing how the society continually enforces that view of delirium being fatal. Throughout that book there are excerpts from the literature and texts that the citizens are exposed to. Propaganda that the governing forces indoctrinate the people with. It made things more believable.<br /><br />Lena was an interesting enough character. At first she seemed a bit dull, and predictable but as the story grew and her inner struggles built she really took shape. By the end I wanted to just give her a final push in the direction I wanted her to take. The friendship she had with Hana was perfect, the way that they view each other and the effects the cure has on their relationship felt real. Alex's appearance was a bit predictable and his not being cured very obvious. But he was a great character. He had such a different view of the world from Lena, and Hana and the rest of the cured. There was enough likability and genuineness to him that he didn't feel like a forced love interest, but rather an important character to the story.<br /><br />The only issue I had with Delirium was that there was a sense of been there, done that to the plot. If you've read Matched by Ally Condi, then this might almost seem a rip off. I don't think it is and by the end I didn't feel that way, but there were some similarities that occasionally had me shaking my head. If you can get past the slight similarities then it's a great read.
0439023491|3.0|I really enjoyed Catching Fire although it didn't keep my interest as the first book in the series did. It definitely felt as though the scope of the story widened as it became less about Katniss and more about politics and war.
0452295548|3.0|What an awesome opportunity to read about a stroke from the perspective of a neuroanatomist with such keen insight to brain function. I learned a lot about the right brain and about what it felt like to experience a stroke, both as it initially hit her and in the early stages of her treatment and recovery. I appreciated the author's great honesty and vulnerability in revealing this information. I was confused at some inconsistencies, such as speaking about not being able to make out the boundaries of people, who seemed like energy fields, and then two paragraphs later speaking of the expressions on their faces or saying that she couldn't understand speech and then telling what the person said.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was that I felt like one of her main purposes was to try to help people understand how they could take control over their brains and choose what circuits to turn on and off and how to access right hemisphere bliss at any moment. The extended chapters on this at the end left me totally without comprehension. I truly wonder how many people who have not gone through a left hemisphere stroke as she did, can isolate brain circuits or even brain hemispheres as she describes or have a clue how to control them.<br /><br />Another disappointment was that her journey of recovery was quite truncated. I think that the book would have much more value to stroke victims and caregivers if more of her recovery journey was covered.
0545123275|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"Shiver\\" and I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Hauntingly poetic and magical, this paranormal romance immediately put me under its spell. Not only is it a refreshing take on the werewolf genre but I found Grace and Sam's love story beautiful, sweet, and heartbreaking. While some may dislike the slower pacing of this novel, I think that in some ways it adds to its charm and gentleness. The author wisely allows the story to breath and gives us some intimate glimpses into the lives and thoughts of the characters. By the end, I was captivated by the story and the characters had melted my winter heart.<br /><br />If it weren't for a few minor plot points that seemed a bit underdeveloped and one course of action that was far fetched, I would have given this book 5 stars.

0316236535|5.0|My preschoolers love it too, but my 1 year old nephew goes crazy for this book, and it's the perfect way to teach them \\"eyes\\" \\"ears\\" \\"nose\\" ect. First every page the monster gains eyes, then ears, then hair. So with each page flip something appears and then you say \\"I'm not scared of you grenn monster, go away purple hair, go away blue nose\\" Not those exact words, but each time you flip the page a body part dissapears and it creates a lot of excitement with the toddler to watch wis face dissapearing piece by piece. Now he's been saying \\"eyes\\" \\"hair\\" ect. thanks to this book. You will love it, it's not any old book, this is a classic for sure!
B007SUW24W|5.0|I have not been this affected by a debut CD since I first heard Tracy Chapman's back in 1988. Like Chapman, Ed Sheeran takes the conventions of folk-music and the singer-songwriter genre and upends them for his own personal style. It's hard to pigeonhole \\"+\\" into any singular category, as this man is influenced by everyone from the Everly Brothers to Elton John to Eminem. I type that line without any irony whatsoever; it makes Ed's first full-length major label album both unclassifiable and unforgettable.<br /><br />Like Chapman, he also has the knack for writing songs that suckerpunch you like \\"Small Bump\\" does, or in the way he machine-guns his way through his cult-hit \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You.\\" More often than not, he stays to the thoughtful singer-songwriter traditions of \\"The A Team\\" and \\"This,\\" yet it is mashing of styles on the likes of \\"Lego House\\" or \\"U.N.I.\\" (You And I) that makes him so fascinating. \\"+\\" is an intriguing and exceptional calling card by an artist to watch.
B000HL2ETW|4.0|Hmm you know what I'm not seeing where the hate for Enterprise stems from...maybe it's because it's not all about diplomacy and federation bureaucracy? There seems to be more suspense and action in this series than I'm used to in Star Trek, but for me it's a welcome addition. As far as first seasons go I can't recall a Star Trek that started out as strong as this series has so far. Take a look at TNG; probably my favorite ST of all, but half of the first season is almost un-watchable....and most ST fans will admit that.<br /><br />A good episode here: The story makes sense, it's not predictable, and the visual effects are impressive, but not invasive. As I mentioned I'm really starting to enjoy this series, and that's a pretty big deal since I'm usually rather critical.<br /><br />T'Pol update 2012 *sigh*:<br />I wanted to give Jolene some episodes before I judge her acting, but my opinion has just gotten worse :\ She's the perfect example of just how hard it is to play a Vulcan. Maybe it's the directors fault, maybe he's telling her to read the lines in a robotic monotone quiet voice...When Compared to Tuvok or Spock you see just how tough it has to be for an actor to BE vulcan, sorry but Jolene fails so hard it takes you out of the moment every time she speaks. Okay; so she's easy on the eyes, but then again so was Seven of Nine, but Jeri Ryan masterfully played that Borg-Human like a damn pro.

0307592731|5.0|I must have considered reading Wild about a dozen times over the past couple of months - every time I browsed the Editor's Picks on my Kindle.  It kept popping up.  I would think, \\"yeah, well I'm interested in getting started with backpacking. Maybe this is the book to inspire me,\\" and then I'd read the description of the book and respond to myself with \\"well, she was a few years younger than me when she did this hike and it seems like it's going to focus more on sentimentality and introspection than the actual hike itself.\\"  I've read more than enough \\"person experiencing tough situations in life and so takes a spiritual journey to find herself\\" memoirs. I also am a bit unnecessarily ageist when it comes to anything autobiographical and didn't think she'd have the self-awareness at 26 that I'd relate to at my somewhat older age. When I read that she'd made the hike in the 90's and was now in her 40s, I changed my mind a bit - ridiculous reason to finally give it a chance, I know.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed's memoir is different. She doesn't just venture ever-so-gently into self-reflective territory; she's unflinchingly honest, her emotions painfully raw. We're not just told about her sadness when her mother dies; we bear witness to her suffering.  She doesn't simply imply she's made questionable decisions with men, but gives us every bit of evidence to prove it.  While laying bare her weaknesses, I could easily see her strength of character.<br /><br />Inspiration is an over-used word to describe memoirs, no doubt, but how else can I describe my own feelings from almost the very beginning of this book. Cheryl sets out to do something for no specific purpose other than it occurred to her to do it. At that point in her life, she felt so lost that she needed to do something huge to save herself. The Pacific Crest Trail was huge.  I know that feeling, and it's just so easy to imagine being in Cheryl's place, feeling desperate, stubbornly following through on a decisiondespite having doubts just because you know, for some unknown reason, it's important.<br /><br />As an avid memoir reader, I generally hope to get, at the least, new insight into a world I know little about.  At the best, I hope to feel what the author felt, see what she saw and be as much there sense-wise as I can be. Wild is lovely that way.  Cheryl's a wonderful, vivid writer.  She doesn't overwhelm us with inane detail but the ones she chooses to give out are there for a specific pupose. When she approaches a water tank on a brutally hot day only to see a 'no water' sign, I can almost cry from the disappointment. When she sits alone in her tent, her only protection against the harshness of nature, I can imagine the physical relief and pain of a body coming to rest after pushing it to its limits.  I can feel the heaviness of a giant backpack on my own shoulders as she walks, the pain of too-tight boots, the ever-present danger of men potentially preying on single female hikers and the surreal embarrassment of being forced to wear duct-tape sandals. Most of all, I can sense the dark and sad thoughts swirling and whirling around and around as she immerses herself in solitude.<br /><br />I've read other adventure memoirs that have disappointed for lack of introspection; they function more as a way of laying down the facts. I'm currently reading AWOL on the Appalachian Trail after seeing it recommended by several people who enjoyed the backpacking adventures of Wild, but after experiencing Cheryl's emotional and physical upheaval, it reads as more of a guidebook, monotone in voice, lacking any form of despair, intensity and hilarity, all of which Cheryl gives us in abundance.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have criticized Cheryl for her sexual choices and heroin use, but it's important to note that she's not defending her behaviors, just simply being truthful about them. While's she's not proud of some of her decisions, she doesn't hide in shame either. Such openness should be lauded rather than judged. She reveals herself as a person just as full of flaws, quirks, pain and humor as we know ourselves to be, and that's what makes the journey of the author such a rich experience for the reader.
B000HKWCOA|4.0|It's strange how it works, when I first gave this a viewing I couldn't get past the first 3 minutes of the first episode. Once that opening theme soft rock clearance-sale-band started in...my friend and I turned to each other and said \\"Are they serious with this?\\" and proceeded to run away as fast as possible. But...I decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did (now I can skip the intro). The special Effects have evolved to a point where they actually enhance the experience, and it makes me wonder how TNG would be if it was made now. It's a small plain cast, but there are some standout characters and I'm loving the idea of the show and the action.<br /><br />As of now Jolene Blalock is the only disappointing part about the show...her acting as T'Pol is lacking. I want to give her a few episodes before I judge her too harshly (maybe she needs time to learn her character?). But as of now it's almost like watching Data try and impersonate a Robot, definitely shows just how talented Tim Russ (Tuvok) and Leonard Nimoy (Spock) were. That's got to be the toughest acting to do; to suppress emotions, but still convey them somehow.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of those rare books that come along infrequently.  The story grabs you by the hand and leads you through the visuals that comprise the night circus.  Fantastic story, great writing, wonderful book.
0441013597|5.0|Much has been said about this masterpiece here, so I will not attempt a full review.  Here are some reflections from my recent re-read of this classic:  in a master stroke, the author makes his characters as beautifully waterless as his landscape.  Not a hint of frivolity, not a moment of wit or humor do any characters display through their hundreds of pages.  Romance is all serious passion, childhood subverted by the harsh political climate.  Just as human life must hold on with grim strength on the barren Arrakis, so Paul, Jessica and the rest forebear all light-heartedness and even wasted dialogue, focusing grimly on the need to survive, politically and physically.  Perhaps a callow reader might long for Jessica to try to stump Chani with a knock-knock joke . . . but such devices would be as destructive to this work as taking a noontime stroll on Arrakis without a stillsuit.
0525478817|5.0|I'm not here to tell you about how wonderful this book is or that you must read it now. You've seen the rating, probably read some of the reviews, so if you're still interested just read this book like a normal book. Don't be expecting a masterpiece or something, and if you don't read books often, it's probably not going \\"change your life\\" as others lead you to believe.<br /><br />The book was hard to get into at first. The dialogue does have some \\"big words\\" and the story didn't seem to go anywhere. The prose is filled with sarcasm and frankness, which I eventually got used to and and began seeing them as quite hilarious. It's definitely a page turner after you got \\"into\\" the book. Hazel and Gus don't talk like normal teenagers, but they are not normal. What draws me into the book is precisely that - how semi-unusual their interactions were. Normal teenagers don't really exchange books to read or speak in metaphors all the time, but that's what so interesting. It's really a breath of fresh air from the usual romance that develops in other books.<br /><br />Even though Alaska remains my favorite John Green character, the book as a whole is his best yet. For someone who's quite normal, I was very curious in Hazel's life, because it seems a lot different than mine. And the same goes for most of the characters - they feel realistic but not what you would typically expect. The book does play with my emotions, capable giving me highs and lows within the same page. For what one would consider a serious book, there are lots of playful outbursts, such as:<br /><br />\\"Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks the Butts of Children.\\"<br /><br />And sometimes there are lines that are so good at making sense:<br /><br />\\"What a slut time is. She screws everybody.\\"<br /><br />That's what I like most about this book. John Green is a smart writer who is very capable of letting you experience his characters' thoughts and feelings. The Fault in Our Stars was an exhausting adventure, but I felt like I learned something new, and it was worth it.

0765316994|3.0|If that sounds like faint praise, it might be. I'd been anticipating this book ever since I heard Mr. Scalzi read the prolog during his tour for Fuzzy Nation. Perhaps I pushed my expectations for it too high. Even so, it was fun.<br /><br />In case you can't tell from the title, or haven't bothered to read the backcover blurb, this is a book about the phenomenon of the high mortality rate among low-ranking starship crew members during away missions. When Mr. Scalzi read the aforementioned prolog and asked the audience to guess at the title, the almost unanimous response was \\"Red Shirt\\" (if you still don't get it, watch an episode of Star Trek with the original crew).<br /><br />This story is told from the viewpoint of the low ranked crew and the lengths they go to in order to avoid assignment to away missions or being stationed on decks that always seem to get opened into space during battle. What they discover about their situation and how they choose to deal with it came as a bit of surprise and a bit of a disaappointment. I'd hoped for a different direction. But decided to go along for the ride and mostly enjoyed it.<br /><br />What works in this book is the fast pace and snarky, inside-joke humor. If you get a joke, you're grinning. If you don't, another is coming right up. What doesn't completely work (although I couldn't put my finger on it at first), is that same fast pace. It focuses on dialog and moving the plot along, at the expense of description and introspection. The characters are often difficult to distinguish (you have to remember their names) and scenes take place in featureless voids.<br /><br />Even so, it was fun. I wish I could give it another half of a star.

159514188X|4.0|I started this book a couple of days ago and usually start my reviews then. But I wasn't looking forward to it. I was, I picked it to read, and I am doing a book talk on it tomorrow, but the subject matter is a little icky for me.<br />Hannah Baker completed suicide.<br />A Baker's Dozen tapes have been left for the thirteen people who brought her to that decision.<br />Clay is one of the thirteen.<br />On the surface this is Hannah's story, it is her feelings and thoughts spoken out loud for all to know. But beneath that, just under that surface, the story belongs to Clay. He is dealing with a friend's suicide, he is dealing with know that he is one of the reasons she is gone, he is trying to hold it together.<br />Hannah isn't always a sympathetic character, she blames herself for so much. She internalizes everything, every little thing that happens is thrown into her life in such a personal way.<br />Clay doesn't see life that way. He is hurt that he even has to listen to the tapes. He is hurt that Hannah hurts. He is concerned that no one helped her - even himself. He hates people that hurt her.<br />Clay is the reason to read this book.<br /><br />I hope that the subject matter doesn't scare you off. It really is a fantastic read. It is quick too.<br />Most of all, it feels so honest, so genuine, so real.<br /><br />Hannah might be gone, but she is Clay's guide to the path of healing and forgiveness.<br />You can't hold yourself responsible for everything.<br /><br />Check out my full review as well as some great suicide resources on my blog:<br /> [...]

B008BM9L72|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. The story line was good and engaging and I couldn't put it down! I would recommend reading it, it is brilliant! The amazon kindle price was excellent too as I bought all three for just over £8. The fact I was able to purchase all three books together meant I didn't have to wait to read the next book which was very convenient. A must have book to read! :)

B007R3AZNK|5.0|I haven't been this happy with taking a chance on a cd in a long time. The more I hear it, the better it gets. If you have a quality sound system, buy it, have a drink and kick back with the volume up enough to hear it loud and clear, and you WON'T be disappointed. I was raised in a musical family, my Dad has a Doctor's degree in music and I've always been very critical. I'm kind of new to the blues and I'm still learning about what's out there. I like the balance of instruments on this cd and as good as he is on the guitar, he doesn't ever overdose you with it like a lot of what I've heard so far. I highly recommend it!

B004QX07G4|1.0|I really enjoy Ellen, however I did not enjoy this book. It was extremely disappointing. So much of it felt like filler, and was just not funny. She makes a joke about accidentally agreeing to write this book and I think she might have been serious. I didn't want to finish it, I only did so I could move on to my next book. I have her stand up, I watch her show, and I have read other books. This pales in comparison.
B000A2UBN4|2.0|I remember going to the theater to see \\"Cape Fear\\" when it was released 20 years ago, and walking out thinking that it just wasn't very good. I decided to re-visit the film just to see if I would like it better now that I'm older and have a family of my own, and the short answer is No. If anything \\"Cape Fear\\" is aging horribly, and outside of the two lead performances, and the re-hash of Bernard Hermann's theme, there really isn't much to recommend about this film.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the story, then quit reading this and watch the original [[ASIN:B00005LC4D Cape Fear]], as it's a taut, suspenseful thriller, with unforgettable performances by the whole cast, and stay away from this dated, bloated remake. The basic story is that Max Cady (Robert Di Niro) is being released from prison after a 14 year sentence for assault. While in prison Cady discovered that his lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), suppressed information that may have gotten him acquitted. Cady tracks down Bowden and begins to terrorize the lawyer and his family. Bowden knows that Cady is dangerous, but also very cunning. Cady bends the law, but does not break it, which means there is very little Bowden can do to stop Cady's harrassment, short of breaking the law himself.<br /><br />While the basic storyline of a ex-con making a lawyer's life hell remains the same as the original, so many story elements which made the original such a fascinating film are altered or thrown out altogether. Martin Scorsese seemed to want to tap into the Alfred Hitchcock mode for this one, so we get a ton of odd camera angles and a variety of overhead shots. It's almost like he's sacrificing substance for flash at times. The cast is horrible beyond the two leads who both put in great performances. Di Niro and Nolte are the only reason to watch this movie. Jessica Lange doesn't really do much here, she gets to yell a few times, but overall she's wasted in the film. I'm not sure how or why in the early 1990's Juliette Lewis was put into films and made a \\"star\\"?? She plays Juliette Lewis with an accent, and umm.....well she was Juliette Lewis. I did like seeing Peck and Mitchum make cameos here, but their being in the film was more of a novelty than adding anything.<br /><br />There is nothing in the remake that isn't done better in the original. So save your time and money, find the classic and do your best to forget this one every happened.Juliette Lewis was put into films and made a \\"star\\"??

B007SGM084|1.0|This trilogy is the biggest pile of poorly written crap I have ever had the misfortune to read. The narrative reads like it was written by a horny 16 year old girl imagining a life with a some rich stranger. I will kick myself for weeks because I fell for the hype surrounding these books.<br /><br />Ana Steele, our \\"heroine\\" is a stupid, spineless, weak-willed, sniveling brat with about as much personality as dish rag. She gives in to all of Christian's demands with minimal argument or resistance. She never makes decisions for herself and allows Christian to control her life, both personal and professional. He uses physical punishment and sex to keep her under his thumb. Every time they argue or Ana tries to assert some form of independence, Christian seduces her and she bends over and takes it.<br /><br />Christian, the \\"dark hero\\", is a controlling and abusive psycho. He uses his wealth and power to take over Ana's life. He is frequently \\"mad\\" at Ana for some discretion and then proceeds to \\"punish\\" her by flogging, spanking and orgasm denial, at one point. His total possession of her is evidenced by his frequent uses of the phrase \\"You're mine\\". He isolates Ana from all of her friends and family and actively stalks her.<br /><br />To suggest that this is, in any way, a love story, is irresponsible and dangerous. This is no Cinderella Story. It is, however, a horribly written example of dysfunction. It is a travesty and disturbing that so many women are in love with these books.
B005TBWN0K|3.0|minimal effect changes but can save to gallery after minor fixes. Not the app you're looking for for color &amp; hue changing effects, etc.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This is simply the best film I have ever seen.<br />There is full view of the fights--never a shaky camera up close fast editing type of scenes. The full view of the action you get is just simply amazing.<br />The brutality hits are just so real looking. You know there are a lot of bruised up bodies in this movie.<br />The plot is insatiable. Very well put together.<br />Very good acting and just a great ensemble of actor/fighters.<br />Great job of editing and scenery. This building was perfect for the movie.<br /><br />Could there be some errors? None that took away from the movie. I just think this movie rocks and rocks over any of this bubble gum movie crap people like Nicholas Cage put out.<br /><br />OVERALL......FANTASTIC AND WORTH EVERY PENNY TO SEE.<br /><br />FINALLY A REAL ACTION FLICK that does not have to be sick, perverted or gory to achieve greatness.
034580404X|5.0|Ok, so I needed to see what the hype was all about.  Are the novels erotic--yes but not in a cheap trashy way.  Honestly, the eroticism has more to do with what women want more of-foreplay.  Take notes men! The love story between Ana and Christian is full of passion and deep love.  Yes, some would say that this doesn't happen in real life but of course women-emotional creatures that we are-wish it would.  Minus the monsterous baggage, Christian is a catch.  For women who find the need to be a nuturer this story is right up your ally.  The appeal of these books is that you find yourself in tune with the feelings that the characters are experiencing through out the story.  This is the pull these books have on the reader.  Yes, it is wonderful that he is rich and leaves Ana wanting for nothing but that isn't the attraction for her or the reader.  The attraction is the deep connection that these two characters seem to have for one another.  I am almost done reading book 2, \\"Fifty Shades Darker.\\"  I will soon be on book 3, \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\"  and I will be very sorry to see this story end.

Have cities from around the country and around the world programmed in so we can dream about being there, we're in Phoenix, this time of year, just about anywhere looks appealing...
1594744769|5.0|Oh my! What can I say about this wonderful, wonderful book? It has everything someone like me is looking for in a book. It has real terror, mystery, a touch of adorable young romance, kids with magical powers, time travel, fantastic explanations of historical mythology, monsters, mysterious legacies, and so much more! When Jacob's strange grandfather dies from a monster attack of which only Jacob experiences (and everyone else thinks he's crazy), he is thrown into a mystery that takes him to an island out of time. There he meets the peculiar children under the care of the eccentric Miss Peregrine. This story is enthralling and mixes lovable characters and their history with real suspense and action. I can't wait to read the sequel to this book which fantastically mixes the best qualities of Harry Potter, Supernatural, X-men and a so many, many other wonderful works that we have all enjoyed through the years. This may be the best book I've read all year!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|iv`e never read a book that has affected me so much. Emotionally brutal, physically sick, completely in awe of Green, and how this book has a pulse. A lot of what i felt about my illness is ingrained in the pages. i cried until i couldn`t anymore. Every page is tear stained. Beautifully written and every character has resonated with me long after the last page.
0525952616|5.0|Hey Bro,<br /><br />Thanks for the great read and the good PR, man. Frankly, that \\"Nevermore\\" stuff was getting old! We avians like how you reeled us in with this high-octane thriller about drones. It's a damn good ride, really gets your pulse going! I was on the edge of my seat, er, perch.<br /><br />But the clincher is how this story makes you want to ask questions. Reexamine your values. Like, what is privacy, really? And just how secure are we anyway? Do we really want to be doing this, dropping shit on people half a world away? And I mean drone-launched explosives, I don't mean guano.<br /><br />Great tech research, dude. It really blurs the line between fiction and non-fiction. We know these things could really happen--worst case scenario, of course. It's a look into a scary new world that is coming frighteningly fast. Thinking birds everywhere will thank you for writing this book.<br /><br />And the characters! Three-dimensional, man. Special-ops steely guy, a rainforest researcher, beltway flacks, shady perps maneuver while all hell breaks loose. Mind-blowing!<br /><br />Speaking of characters, don't you think we ravens are the unsung heroes of this story? Though of course, we don't sing, we caw. As a group, we're really big on national security and willing to put ourselves on the line. (Though I do have to say that cyborg beetle was nasty going down!) We rule the skies, dude, and we're not about to give that up to some surveillance drone that only looks like a bird--really, what were you thinking? And I'll tell you a little secret, we got the lovers together. Yes, we did. I'll say no more.<br /><br />Anyway, I just want to say to everyone, buy Kill Decision. This guy is smart and this guy is imaginative, so take advantage of it and have a fun ride.<br /><br />And to you, my man, keep flyin' high and keek keek<br /><br />Huginn<br /><br />P.S. Mu sends her love
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I gotta admit, I was avoiding Lana Del Rey and Born to Die when she blew up earlier this year. Her music just seemed so somber and depressing and I wasn't in the mood for that at the time.<br /><br />However, I finally gave in last week when I was browsing the top indie sellers on Amazon and there it was, Born to Die, at the top of the list. And for $3.99, I figured it was worth it to find out what the hype was about.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed; this album is straight-up sad as hell. But that's not such a bad thing - it has focus.<br /><br />Initially, I loved the sound. The album is beautifully produced with excellent instrumentals to back Lana's husky (and at times, surprisingly sweet, pop, and girly, for lack of better words) vocals and gloomy lyrics. For me, the first and titular track, \\"Born to Die\\", is my favorite as it sets the tone for the rest of the album and embodies the mindset with which Lana wrote the album.<br /><br />(Also note the hip hop influences in the music as well as the lyrics.)<br /><br />But after repeat listens, because this is the type of music that gets into your head and keeps you coming back, I began to think that it wasn't as great as I first thought it was. To me, it seemed like the content was what a 16-year old high schooler might come up with; the pains of love, existential crises, drugs and alcohol and money, and feeling a little self-destructive.<br /><br />Now, I understand that angsty teenagers don't have a monopoly on what I listed above, but it was the lyrics behind that enchantingly despondent, slightly dazed way Lana sings.<br /><br />-- 'You and I, we were born to die; I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers; You're so fresh to death...I will love you 'til the end of time; Money is the reason we exist; I wish I was dead; All my friends tell me I should move on...Loving you forever, can't be wrong.' --<br /><br />Just some examples - and actually the line, 'I will love you 'til the end of time', in \\"Blue Jeans\\" is one of my favorites from the album, but it also serves to prove my point.<br /><br />Which is: this album is shallow; a choice word a friend offered me in regard to Born to Die which I agree with wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Personally, I like her music, but this album was about a girl going through a bad break-up, talking about drinking and getting high, all camouflaged at first listen by the sophistication of funereal string arrangements and an overall amazing production. With repeat listens, the former overtook the latter for me and I couldn't get the word \\"shallow\\" out of my head. After six or seven songs of this, the second half of the album is more of the same and kind of blurs together for me.<br /><br />That being said, I truly did enjoy the album more than I didn't. It's sad and childish, but elegantly done in both regards. I hope Lana Del Rey follows Born to Die with a more diverse effort - in subject matter and lyrical content. And fosho, I won't wait half a year after it comes out to buy it.

In one sentence: it's a book about two people pointing fingers at each other, as the author builds your anticipation for a victory ending, only to provide you with the worst ending ever. I'd suggest you read the worst book you can image 50x before reading thi. You suck Gillian, I can't believe how lousey that ending was. Shocked.

B007WFR1MQ|3.0|Fear Factory delivers the goods with their new release \\"The Industrialist\\" but at the cost of innovation.  The first 3 tracks hit you in the face right away.  These songs show great musicianship, progression and are heavy, fierce, melodic and sinister.  This is the sound of Post-Millennium Fear Factory.  Then \\"God Eater\\" kicks in and we are no longer in Fear Factory territory but Machine Head land with its slower groove and gratuitous use of artificial harmonics.  Not particularly a bad thing but not exactly groundbreaking either.  From here on out the group goes on autopilot and we are treated to familiar sounds and structures.  \\"Depraved Mind Murder\\" could have been on \\"Archetype.\\"  Seems Dino took the initiative to rip off Christian for ripping him off on that particular album.  \\"Virus of Faith,\\" \\"Difference Engine,\\" and \\"Disassemble\\" sound like they could be on \\"Obsolete\\" or \\"Demanufacture.\\"  Once again not really a bad thing but for a band that lays its foundation on being innovative it seems they are using old tricks.  The album closers \\"Religion is Flawed...\\" is a short piano piece and \\"Human Augmentation\\" is an ambient electronic piece.  This seems like a lazy approach to close an album because they already did this on \\"Remanufacture\\" and \\"Archetype.\\"  Even lazier considering they can barely do their own electronics when they have Rhys Fulber at the helm.  He is vital though because he gives Fear Factory their sound.  Without him they lose a lot of atmosphere and depth.  Listen to \\"Transgression\\" and \\"Soul of a New Machine\\" for proof. The story itself is okay when listening to the album but kind of boring on its own and is derivative of Blade Runner.  So overall the album is decent but it does come across as sounding a bit too familiar at times.  It seems like they started on an album that showed promise and innovation but when they decided to go with the concept they slipped back into comfortable territory.  3 1/2 Stars.

I got this book today in the mail and I've been glued to it this really made me  sit back and look at all the guys I've dated thus far and i could honestly say that they just weren't into me as much . I feel armed and ready for the dating scene again prepared to happily turn down the less than worthy and stop trying to make all the square ass holes fit in my round hole!

B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great story.  As an adult reader it definitely had sufficient action and depth of description to hold me.  It was hard to put down and there was enough tension etc to keep me up until the wee small hours!!  I felt that the characters and situations were well developed.  I read the Kindle version and had no problems.  I only wish that the other two titles in the trilogy had been available in the Kindle format.  It's a good read and I would recommend it as a gift for early teens but adults, I am sure, would find it attractive.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know the books are all the rage; I hadn't heard much about content, just that it was the best trilogy to come out in years. So, I got all three. I am no prude; I love erotica, am not adverse to the occasional soft porn movie, and a little playful slap and tickle is fine in its place, but come on!<br /><br />I am disappointed to hear that so many women are excited reading a book that perpetuates the idea that a good woman can keep a man if she will only allow him to beat her, humiliate her, stalk her (or have her stalked), isolate her from her friends and family . . . Absolutely ridiculous! I got halfway through the first book, asked friends if it got any better as it went on, and after hearing their answer, trashed the set.<br /><br />The worst part is, I see teenage girls and boys reading the books. We work hard to teach our daughters that no man has the right to mistreat them, and one of the most telling marks of emotional/mental abuse in a relationship is one party isolating the other from friends, family, and activities--yet our kids are reading this, seeing us read this, hearing about hotels catering to those who want to 'experience the Fifty Shades experience\\", and thinking all is fine and dandy.<br /><br />What a shame.
0345803493|2.0|This is an unbelievably bad sequel to the previous book. The first one, after reading the introduction at the back, got me going and excited about reading. However, after finishing the book, I was utterly...dumbfounded. I can definitely write better than that! Comparing to all the erotica authors I have read, this book really felt like it was published from an amateur..without an editor! Or any editor who even let this book and the first one be published is an idiot. Or he/she wasn't doing his/her job. Poorly executed, psychotic, annoying, unrealistic characters. Can't believe I wasted my time on this book and the previous one.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|Take heed: there be spoilers ahead<br /><br />\\"If you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal... you become something else entirely. A legend, Mr. Wayne, a legend!\\" Here we are, seven years since Christopher Nolan saved the Batman legacy from the pit of bat crap that it fell into during the `90s. Batman Begins was, as the name implies, a fresh beginning, a reimagining of something that held great potential in a post 9/11culture. So, it is no surprise that the words of Ra's al Ghul should bring us full circle in The Dark Knight Rises. These words, \\"...an ideal...a legend...\\" expose the shadow of Liam Neeson's too-benevolent cultist throughout Nolan's trilogy. They unmask the difference between men and their legacies; they contrast the polarizing sacrifice Ra's al Ghul made with the Bat's sacrifices; and they reveal a story not just about superheroes and absurd villains but symbols, ideals, icons and the things which make them.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises begins with two symbols bred into Gotham's collective unconscious eight years earlier with the death of the white knight, Harvey Dent, and the betrayal of the dark knight, Batman. The Batman, billionaire Bruce Wayne's alter-ego, has gone into retirement. Meanwhile, Gotham is getting along well under the guidance of commissioner Jim Gordon (played once more by the always-talented Gary Oldman) and vigorous, noble cops like John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). That is until a slinky Selena Kyle sets into motion a chain of events that lead to the arrival of one of Batman's most notorious villains, Bane (Tom Hardy).<br /><br />The plot that unfolds involves monstrous action scenes, looming cityscapes, and a music score that, while not at all subtle, does exemplify Nolan's current embrace of epic, booming sounds. That said, if you come to this movie looking for constant emotional grip and release, you will certainly find it, not to mention a cast that becomes itself in terms of character and character development. You will also find socio-political satire that comments on both wings of American politics. And surprisingly, there is a comic lightness (in act 1) that was missing in The Dark Knight. But, above all of this, what really makes this film worth watching is Nolan's insistence on converging the physical world of Gotham, the mental planes of Bruce Wayne's mind, and the metaphysical shroud that makes objects like the Batsuit, Batcave, and Pit so enthralling for audiences. So how does he do this? That is where the making of symbols comes in.<br /><br />Throughout this trilogy, Nolan has taken a man and conveyed physicality, mentality, and metaphysicality all through his desire to create a society capable of knowing good. Of course, this is paradoxical--how does a man become more than a man and less than a man at the same time--and it is what drives so many to wonder if the Bat will die or live on at the end of this movie. Because ultimately, we come to realize that a man cannot live as a person and become a symbol at the same time. While he lives, he is judged by the actions he makes and will make. But, when he dies, like Harvey Dent and Ra's al Ghul, he is seen by what he has done. In truth, he becomes a legend.nd character development.

B000000H48|3.0|I like the overall sound of this CD as well as the story, but the songs on here are just not very memorable.  The disc starts strong with \\"At the Graves\\" and \\"Sleepless Nights\\" but then loses steam from there.  \\"Amon Belongs to Them\\" is a stellar song mid-album but that's about it.  I've listened to this cd several times over the past few weeks to get a really good feel for it, and I feel that 3 stars is right.  3 stars means 'okay' and I think that's what this disc is: okay.<br /><br />Would I recommend Conspiracy to fans of KD?  Heck yes!  But again, it's not their best.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|Caution! This movie does not whisk you away. You cannot bully it from start to finish with the rage of a juggernaut on acid. This is not that sort of movie, so you cannot watch it with that mindset. Instead, Take Shelter calls for a different approach. This is the sort of film that you must allow to move you. Let it work its plot slowly, not to torture you, but to build in you the emotions, the powerful tension, the stress that each character feels. And while these things are a long time (~2 hours) forming, the sheer magnitude of the climax makes that wait well worth it.<br /><br />Now, let's discuss a movie. Take Shelter is a suspense/thriller directed by Jake Nichols and starring Michael Shannon as Curtis, a quiet, hard-working member of his small, midwest town. Until now, Curtis's life has been normal. His wife Samantha, played by the talented Jessica Chastain, loves him and their deaf daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) with a quiet, but attentive ferocity. Curtis seems content with his job in construction. He enjoys winding down from work with a beer or two, and he's a member of the Lion's Club. Small town everyman, no? But, then Curtis begins having visions--not just dreams, but intense, disturbing events that make him both paranoid and hyper-manic. As the plot takes shape, these visions haunt Curtis more and more until finally, he is compelled to build a tornado shelter capable of withstanding far more than tornadoes.<br /><br />It is this performance by Shannon that really propels Take Shelter. His brooding eyes and half-slack jaw detail an interior struggle with his own apocalyptic fears and the fear that he is becoming increasingly delusional. Not a single word is wasted in Curtis's development, either. Every line delivers incredible tension, and each time Curtis speaks, we feel compelled to question the conflicts that arise between protecting those you love and allowing yourself to accept their protection. In ways, this struggle alludes to the Noah's ark narrative that so engrosses our cultural thought. We have always been consumed with the fear of social estrangement because of the need to fold fast to beliefs. Thus, the emotional toll in Take Shelter: there is a powerful `Sturm und Drang' here that elevates the plight of the individual as he falls victim to the wholesale wishes of his society at large.<br /><br />In short, Take Shelter sends us down a euphonic and visual rabbit hole that perfectly combines atmosphere with mood. And while the conclusion is a while coming, it is certainly worth the effort.tive that so engrosses our cultural thought.

039472903X|3.0|If we've learned one thing from reality programming, it's that everyone thinks they know how to make an ad. And that everyone is pretty much wrong.    Such was also the case when David Ogilvy wrote \\"Ogilvy on Advertising\\" in 1983. In Ken Roman's 2009 biography of Ogilvy, the former Chairman and CEO of the venerable Scot's agency described its reception this way:      \\"`The book of David' as Madison Avenue called it, was judged `as fine a primer on advertising as has ever been written.' John Caples said it was `the most exciting and instructive volume about advertising I have ever seen' and `a must for every ambitious advertising man.' In a peculiar comparison, The London Standard named Ogilvy `the Einstein of Advertising.'\\"    Which is great, of course, but you have to wonder: why, after writing \\"Confessions of an Advertising Man\\" in 1962 - a book that has few equals in our industry - did Ogilvy feel compelled to write another book covering many of the same topics? What had changed since then?    Well, the [to read the rest of this review, please visit theagencyreview.wordpress.com/ogilvy-on-advertising/]

0812550706|5.0|As so many others have said, Card clearly understood the mind of this child character and that's what makes the novel so widely loved to many who normally do not lean toward sci fi.<br /><br />But one thing stood out to me the first time I read it. How Ender's brother and sister managed to become widely recognized, published writers and thinkers at such young ages, anonymously on the nets. I think there's going to come a time when all people have their own online presence, and also freely create fictitious, anonymous personages for themselves, and I think this could be an incredibly healthy thing to be able to do, especially for the young.<br /><br />Why? Because people want to be able to say what is truly on their mind, experiment with their ability to express themselves, and, if they happen to take an experiment a bit too far, have the luxury of simply deleting that character and starting fresh. At the time Card wrote Ender's Game it seemed such ability to post anonymously was only going to become a richer, better experience. Sadly, the opposite is becoming true. Our online footprints are easier to trace than anything else we do. I hope that changes.<br /><br />But it is a fascinating aspect of Ender's Game that the title character's siblings, bred to be impossibly talented, find this mechanism to gain influence over the world.<br /><br />Another element to the story is the actual control interface Ender uses during certain battles, how it is three dimensional in a way that makes his 3d battle school weightless training relevant. I won't try to give away more than that, other than to say that not only was Card many years ahead of his time, Ender's Game holds up because it is simply a beautiful story. It seems to me that fans can tell when an author has fallen in love with his own characters.
0385335997|5.0|After reading [[ASIN:B000FC2L1O Outlander: with Bonus Content]], the first book in the series, I reserved the next two books at the Library.  [[ASIN:0385335997 Voyager (Outlander)]], the third book in the series, was the first to become available, so I read it out of sequence.  I have been enrapt as I read the story of Claire and Jamie Fraser, amazing main characters from different centuries; who find love, romance, adventure, and excitement as they travel throughout Europe, across the Atlantic, and through the Caribbean.<br /><br />Diana Gabaldon is an amazing author, who thoroughly researched the contents of the medical, historical, religious, geographical, and cultural aspects of her fascinating characters' stories.<br /><br />This series is so good that I went to the used bookstore and bought several books in the series so that I can continue to follow the amazing adventure.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I just finished the third book in the series of this Trilogy.<br />I think it was difficult to get my head wrapped around the fact that is centered around the entire thought of the hunger games. I felt it would be interesting to try to let go of reality and common-sense and try to see if I can get through the first book. I feel that the author matures as the books go on and although I didn't really enjoy the first book, I enjoyed the second book even more and really enjoyed the third book. Granted, I feel writing style is more for an adolescent, however the pure gore and violence is clearly only for an adult.<br />I liked it. It was a fun read. Obviously the main premise of the book is a young girl struggling with her own insanity and one must wonder if this is all in her head in some fantastic delusion..

B004LWZWGA|5.0|.<br />AS ALWAYS, NO SPOILERS HERE:<br /><br />How difficult must it have been for Christopher Nolan to have put together this movie?  With such lofty hopes (and $$) placed upon his shoulders, such fan expectations?  And then, to have had the terrible tragedy attached to its premiere...<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" really had a mountain to climb in order to even come close to pleasing the general public.<br /><br />And, the verdict?<br /><br />Here it is: \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is absolutely amazing.  I loved this movie, and consider it a remarkable achievement.  Sure...there were a few faults with it (and I'll address them in a few paragraphs) but all in all Nolan has provided us with not only a great adventure and a dramatically compelling storyline, but also a fitting ending to Nolan's trilogy.  It is a graphic novel with real gravitas, a fully considered finale to a sweeping epic.<br /><br />And DON'T WORRY, I will NOT include any spoilers as I discuss it.<br /><br />First of all: you should know what kind of movie you're going to see.  For those about to leave home to plop themselves down in a (hopefully) comfortable movie theater, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is not \\"The Avengers\\"...for good reason.  While the latter film is all action, action, action from the get-go, \\"TDKR\\" is much more drama-oriented.<br /><br />I've heard some complaints from people who said it was too slow, or too long, and this equated to boredom.  However, I think they simply didn't realize that Christopher Nolan is a serious director, and wanted to tell a \\"real\\" and serious story, not just create a typical pop comic strip in film format.  This is not to knock \\"The Avengers\\"--I think it's one terrific movie, one of the best I've seen in recent years.  Of its type.<br /><br />The beauty of \\"TDKR\\" and its predecessors is that Nolan and his brother Jonathan have created a three-story arc that sets a tale into motion, full of backstory and motivation, progresses that narrative through an exciting and sweeping character-driven tale that questions not only the ethics and morality of a single, powerful law officer, but then examines what outcome such an iconic man might expect.<br /><br />IF HE WERE REAL, in other words, what toll would crime-fighting take upon such a figurehead, especially given the motivations of those who chose to battle him, and how might a man of Batman's stature hope to conclude such an occupation\\"?  He couldn't expect to go on forever--so how might his story be resolved?<br /><br />In other words, this is not your grand-daddy's Batman who just went on forever, dispatching foes by the end of every comic book.  Nor is this even the movie begun under Tim Burton's initially competent hand, unfortunately fizzling out and all but sent to the death chamber under the inept Joel Schumacher (\\"Batman Beyond\\").<br /><br />No, \\"TDKR\\" is a real and plausible third and final chapter for this particular Batman legend --and please note that I am leaving the ending completely open to all possibilities.  I am only saying that Nolan is done; he is not coming back and he has fashioned his film in this manner.<br /><br />Okay: \\"TDKR\\" is not a perfect movie, as there were some rough edges in the story-telling.  For one thing, the time scale seemed off as the story progressed from Bane's takeover of Gotham City and neared its end...you weren't prepped as to when weeks between scenes switched into hours and then into minutes.  And certain developments weren't clear, either: where was Batman placed after his first entanglement with Bane?  And in this post-revolution city, which police officers were imprisoned and which weren't--and how did those who weren't stay out of the jailors' reach?<br /><br />Some of these questions will probably be resolved for me upon further viewings...and I do plan to see this film over and over again.  As with other really good movies, one can expect to see deeper and deeper levels every time they watch.  Christopher Nolan isone of those directors, and he populates his movies with all sorts of important dramatic planes that bear up to more intense scrutiny, allowing the movie to evolve from one viewing to another.<br /><br />As one might be able to tell from this review, I am a huge fan of Nolan's, and have followed him from his beginning in, well, \\"Following,\\" as atypical a movie as one might find, perhaps with the exception of \\"Memento,\\" his next one, which is told in reverse order.  In and around the Batman tales, he has also directed \\"Insomnia,\\" \\"The Prestige\\" and \\"Inception,\\" which are no slouches as films, either.  (Incidentally, he and screenwriter David S. Goyer are the writers of the next \\"Superman\\" movie, due out next year.)<br /><br />I hope this year Nolan's \\"TDKR\\" is recognized by the Academy as one of the best movies of the year--it was an injustice that\\" The Dark Knight\\" was not.  Whether a really great film started from a more entertaining genre like a graphic novel should not count against it--\\"A History of Violence,\\" \\"V for Vendetta, \\" \\"Road to Perdition\\" and \\"American Splendor\\" are all landmark films deserving of serious consideration on their own.<br /><br />After all, Mark Twain and Charles Dickens were serialized in newpapers each week.  I think they've stood the test of time, don't you?one of those directors, and he populates his movies with all sorts of important dramatic planes that bear up to more intense scrutiny, allowing the movie to evolve from one viewing to another.<br /><br />As one might be able to tell from this review, I am a huge fan of Nolan's, and have followed him from his beginning in, well, \\"Following,\\" as atypical a movie as one might find, perhaps with the exception of \\"Memento,\\" his next one, which is told in reverse order.

One thing in the book that took me by surprise was the ending, which I won't spoil for you if you haven't read the book. My favorite part was learning about fictional game creator James Haliday and how he created the virtual reality known as the OASIS. If you don't understand some of the video game terms that are used in this book, don't worry! Most of them are explained as they come up in the book. The tech vocab shouldn't stop you from reading this book. Overall, Ready Player One is one of the best books I have read in a long time, and I highly recommend it.

Your attention can only be sustained for short periods of time until the next article of clothing is being removed or...<br />3.  You are interested in knowing all of the possible places to have sex (including but not limited to tables, showers, elevators, cars, hotel rooms)... personally, I'm surprised the sidewalk was not thrown in there...<br /><br />Absolutely do not read this book if...you somehow think that there is hope that you will also find a 27 year old gorgeous, handsome, talented and rich (muscle rippled) man who will screw you endlessly, buy you a 7000 square foot mansion (as well as multiple cars and computers), take you gliding, helicoptering and sailing, kiss you daily with extreme passion and moan \\"Oh xxxx\\" (insert your name here) several times whilst having his 3 daily orgasms.<br /><br />Enough said.

B007SRLEFS|4.0|Fantastic new album from Glen Hansard! Simple songs with strong impact are a hallmark of this brilliant musician- at times hopeful and yearning and at others devastating and full of despair, it's all there. Mr. Hansard has mastered the art of storytelling with music!<br />A CD version of the album is included, but listening to the vinyl LP version really lets this music \\"breathe\\"- as it should! I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with CD or mp3 sound. Vinyl far surpasses both by creating a listening experience- more ambient, more organic, more real. It is difficult to describe verbally and should be experienced by all! I highly recommend listening to anything on vinyl!
B000002UA2|4.0|Like \\"More,\\" \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" is a soundtrack for a Barbet Schroeder film -- \\"The Valley,\\" in this case. Unlike \\"More,\\" the members of Pink Floyd clearly were ready for such a task, as this record is far superior.<br /><br />That's true even though -- again like \\"More\\" -- \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" features a number of instrumentals; of the 10 tracks here, only six have lyrics, with the rest being instrumentals. But the Floyd by this time had learned how to create atmosphere, so that even the instrumentals are evocative. Especially good along those lines: The title track, \\"Mudmen\\" and \\"Absolutely Curtains,\\" the latter of which does feature a vocal chant by the Mapuga tribespeople.<br /><br />But the songs with vocals are the most developed, and nearly every one of the four is very good. Exceptionally noteworthy is the haunting \\"Burning Bridges,\\" composed by guitarist David Gilmour and keyboardist Rick Wright; they share vocals on the song. Also deserving of merit is bassist Roger Waters' \\"Free Four.\\" Yes, lines like \\"the memories of a man in his old age / are the deeds of a man in his prime\\" can seem a bit quaint now, but this is one of Waters' early songs about losing his father -- a theme that would resurface on \\"The Wall\\" and really resonate on \\"The Final Cut.\\"<br /><br />I also like Gilmour's \\"Childhood's End,\\" inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke novel of the same name.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very fine effort from the Floyd. Certainly it doesn't hold together as well as the concept albums that would follow, but it's still a very worthy collection of songs.

B004ZN9UZO|4.0|More than a few critics were pretty hostile toward Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" when the album was released in 1977. Then again, the Floyd had set the bar so high on its previous two releases that it's not really surprising there would be a backlash. 1975's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and 1973's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" still rank as two of the greatest British rock albums of all time, with their grand lyrical scope and excellent music.<br /><br />And those two albums SOUNDED so good -- they were like the rock 'n' roll equivalent of tropical jungles, incredibly lush and richly complex.<br /><br />\\"Animals\\" was still a sonic pleasure, but it was a step down, partly because Pink Floyd was setting up its own studio, and the equipment and recording spaces just were not up to the quality standards of Abbey Road, where they (and a band called the Beatles) had recorded previously.<br /><br />Furthermore, \\"Animals\\" had a much harder edge. Gone were the Dick Parry sax solos that had made \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" sound so warm and appealing. In their place, guitarist David Gilmour was delving into a more aggressive style; his playing always had been quite good, but it never rocked as hard as it does here.<br /><br />Finally, there was the issue of songwriting. Of the five cuts -- the two parts of \\"Pigs on the Wing,\\" plus the longer \\"Dogs,\\" \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" and \\"Sheep\\" -- two were retreads. \\"Dogs,\\" previously called \\"You Gotta Be Crazy,\\" and \\"Sheep,\\" once known as \\"Raving and Drooling,\\" had not made the cut for \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" Bassist/vocalist/lyricist Roger Waters rewrote them, introducing the animal themes to go along with the \\"Pigs\\" songs and hey, presto! A new concept album was born, cast very much in the likness of George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" where the pigs are the intellectual but morally ambiguous overlords, the dogs are their \\"muscle,\\" and the sheep must follow blindly or be torn to pieces.<br /><br />This was Waters' scathing commentary on late-1970s English ennui and bitterness. Economic woes and a general sense of unease really were in the air -- and everyone knows that in bad times, people do tend to become a bit more animalistic.<br /><br />\\"Dogs\\" is my favorite track here. The lack of saxes aside, the 17-minute song features some absolutely blazing Gilmour guitar work. And the song boasts something a lot of fans (and critics) have missed over the years. Gilmour sings the first half of it ... and he sings in the second-person point of view, too (\\"you\\" this and \\"you\\" that). After the instrumental break, Waters takes over the vocals through the song's end, and Waters' contribution is in FIRST person (\\"I gotta admit...\\" and so on). The shift -- from Gilmour's more tuneful voice to Waters' more brittle one, from the slight distance provided by the second person to the incredibly withering personal feel of the first person -- is at once subtle, dramatic and effective.<br /><br />The other songs here are not as good. \\"Pigs on the Wing,\\" split into two parts on most formats, opens and closes the album. Musical historians and dinosaurs such as myself will remember that there was an 8-track-only version, which joined the two pieces with a solo by Snowy White, who played second guitar on some Floyd tours (Gilmour declined to do it himself, for some reason). \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is pushed along by a swirling organ part from keyboardist Rick Wright, and it sounds positively dated after the synth sounds Wright had created for \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sheep,\\" the album closer, was actually quite a powerful song, even though lyrically it displayed the same bitterness that marked the rest of \\"Animals.\\"<br /><br />Flaws or no, this album has long been a favorite of mine. My top two PF albums are \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish,\\" but I would put \\"Animals\\" third -- ahead of \\"The Wall\\" and definitely better than \\"The Final Cut,\\" \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell.\\"<br /><br />But this is also the album on which serious cracks began to develop in Floydworld -- big divisions and bad feelings between band members. For one thing, previously prolific keyboardist Wright had no songs to contribute, which angered Waters, who felt he was shouldering more and more of the creative burden (Gilmour co-wrote, with Waters, the music for \\"Dogs\\"). Meanwhile, Gilmour and Waters continued their bickering over how the Floyd should sound, with Waters preferring a more spare, \\"drier\\" sound and Gilmour pushing for more reverb and gloss. By the time \\"The Wall\\" was finished, Waters would insist Wright be fired. Waters himself then left the band after \\"The Final Cut,\\" and Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason brought Wright back for the two subsequent studio albums.<br /><br />Not until 2005 would Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunite with Waters, and then it was for a one-off performance at the Live 8 concert in London. Wright died of cancer in 2008, apparently bringing the Floyd era to its end.<br /><br />\\"Animals\\" is a reminder of how Pink Floyd sounded at their most forceful and bellicose. It's a great record to revisit after all these years.bum on which serious cracks began to develop in Floydworld -- big divisions and bad feelings between band members.

B000SEIK2S|2.0|Given the large number of positive reviews, I was disappointed with the actual product.  As noted, the book introduces a universe in which humans exist in Darwinian competition with alien species and retired citizens are rejuvenated to fight in defense of humanity.  The book has three sections, each of which is disappointing in its own way.<br /><br />The book starts well; I bought it after reading the sample chapter.  The first section introduces the main character, a 75 year-old widower, and follows him through the process of induction into the Colonial Defense Forces and physical rejuvenation.  This section introduces a number of interesting ideas: the species in the universe are nearly all expansionist and compete violently for resources; the ideal colonists come from high birth-rate cultures or countries; old people make good soldiers; and Earth, while still the population center of humanity, is technologically inferior to its colonies.  Unfortunately, none of these interesting ideas are explored in any depth.  The idea of 'old' soldiers is the only topic that gets much discussion and even then in extremely superficial ways: jokes about having to pee often and the assumption that the first desire of rejuvenated geriatrics is to have lots of sex.<br /><br />The second section deals with training and fighting in the Colonial Defense Forces.  It is essentially very bad military sci-fi.  The drill instructor is stereotyped.  The military procedure details have mistakes (e.g. first platoons have numbers and companies have letters to designate them; later platoons have letters).  The main character advances in a silly, idealistic way: he luckily impresses the drill sergeant; he has the best ideas in a training competition; he saves the day in his first battle; he saves the day in another battle.  He gets promoted from corporal to lieutenant (as though this is a normal military reward) and receives no officer training.  Actual character development is essentially nil.<br /><br />The third section introduces a mystery concerning the 'Ghost Brigades,' and the main character's deceased wife.  I'll avoid giving away the details, but this section too disappointed.  Some (new) complex issues are explored a little here, but only briefly.  Things come together too conveniently.  Elements of the romance feel contrived rather than emotionally engaging.  The action is again very poor (grenades are 'tossed' at one moment and fired from rifles the next; a senior special forces officer forgets where she put her ammunition).<br /><br />The bottom line is that the book has little to commend it except for a breezy story line and a few interesting plot twists.  These kept me reading through the end, but ultimately I was sorry that I had wasted my time and money.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|I purchased this video because Johnny Depp always gives a great performance. Also, it was filmed in Puerto Rico and intertwines with real and fictionalized events. The San Juan Star did in fact exist and many scrupulous characters in the real estate business always abound. The attention to detail with regards to the look and ambiance of early 60's Puerto Rico is dead on. The characters are believable and I remember the local newspapers reporting how friendly and courteous Johnny Depp was with the locals while he was here filming.Don't pass the opportunity to see this entertaining film.

B001GXYBY6|5.0|The critics didn't get it, audiences didn't watch it but the Wachowski Brothers' version of the anime 'Speed Racer' is absolutely brilliant!  Why do I say that?  For starters, you don't need to know a thing about the original anime to understand and love this movie.  I'm no fan of the original anime, I've never seen a single episode and yet Speed Racer is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.  It does help to know that the movie is based on an anime, otherwise you may wonder what the cartoonish look is all about.  Second, the Wachowski brothers nailed the feel and look of this movie.  A live action movie based on an anime about racing is not about character development, complex plotting or realism, it's about flat out, crazy fun!  This movie is just that; no excuses, no apologies, nothing but a technologically beautiful showcase for absolutely insane, utterly impossible racing!  I should add that the plot does make perfect sense but don't get lost in the details, they really don't matter.  The cast is very solid with the likes of Susan Sarandon and John Goodman but I especially loved Emile Hirsch's simple, determined portrayal of Speed and Christina Ricci's adorable and fearless Trixie.  Everyone's character portrayals were perfect fits for this movie, they were all 100% on board with the feel of the whole project.<br /><br />Full of anime style scenes and camera angles, bursting with every color your display can handle and the coolest, most crazy fun racing you've ever seen, Speed Racer is the perfect movie!  When I say perfect, I mean it knows exactly what it's going for and it nails it, dead center.  I could say a lot more but I won't.  All I will say is if you want to watch a movie that is built from the ground, up around pure, simple, unbridled fun, Speed Racer is your ticket!

Great work, everybody!\\"<br /><br />This was simply one of the worst compilations of \\"rock\\" music I have ever heard. The riffs are boring! The lyrics are boring! The music is boring!

Fork In The Road, Le Noise, and now this slapped together disc of clap-trap are good examples but this theme has occurred consistently throughout his career. WTF old man?<br />If you, like me insist on a totally complete Neil Young catalog, then buy this cd, listen to it once, write a similarly negative review and finally, file it away never to be heard again forever.<br />This guy has got to be great for us to eagerly await the next gem or turkey he releases.

B004VFYOA2|3.0|I finally watched this, bought it about 2 months ago......better than I expected......<br /><br />But, there is no way you can give it more than 3 stars. The quality of the audio would be 4 stars easily but the video is worth 2 at the most. The video is really bad. Let me put it this way: it is a video bootleg quality level.<br /><br />But I read the reviews before purchasing it and would buy it again. The reason why I bought it was to see Steve Vai playing with David Coverdale. And the band is great with Vandenberg, Sarzo and Aldrigde. The entire band is motivated, energetic and dedicated through the entire concert.<br /><br />David is singing great, really great.<br /><br />Another reason for you to buy this is that Whitesnake gets worse every year after this. The real Whitesnake, for me, is the one of the first albums. after Bernie left they still could come up with some good albums, Saints and Sinners, 1987, Slide it In, but as time went by David sung higher and higher, and the music of the band got heavier and heavier. This is not a problem in itself. The problem though is that Whitesnake is not a heavy metal band and David is not Glenn Hughes. That is what makes it complicated. The album David did with Steve for example is one of the bad ones, unfortunately. They did not gel in the studio I think. It was the beginning of the descend.<br /><br />Anyway, again, in this DVD David still has the incredible voive we know and love and seeing him together with Steve Vai on stage is an event in itself.<br /><br />Buy it!

B000003TAB|3.0|Incesticide was released in 1992, the same year that Bleach got a CD release (previouslyI Record Only) and Nirvana had their fantastic performance at the Reading Festival in the UK. There are a few good songs on here, but a lot seem to fall short. It's made up of singles, B-sides, covers, and some originals.<br /><br />(5/5) Dive - This was a really promising start to the album. Dive is fantastic and sounds a lot like Blew, also one of my favorites by Nirvana. This is my favorite song on the album, but  there isn't much to say about this except that it got my hopes up and was the b-side to the next song...<br /><br />(4.5/5) Sliver - Dive/Sliver make up the first two tracks. \\"Sliver\\" is the only non-album single by Nirvana (Excluding the Jesus Lizard/Oh the Guilt single because that had a different band on it) and was a pretty good song. Not fantastic, but good enough to warrant a 4.5. It's short at only 2:17, and is one of the funnier songs that Kurt has written. It's a short story about going to Grandma's house.<br /><br />(3/5) Stain - Not very impressive. This is one of only two songs where Kurt says \\"f**k,\\" along with Lounge Act from Nevermind. This is really where the album starts to go down. I mean, I was expecting one or two annoying songs, but not more than half the album!<br /><br />(3.5/5) Been A Son - This sounds WAAAAAAAAAY to refined. Kurt always hated having multi-track songs and refined sound. This sounds like some vocals were done more than some pop songs, and the guitar doesn't have any punch to it (if you play guitar, you know what I mean.) A lot of people think this is about Kurt's daughter, Frances Cobain.<br /><br />(2/5) Turnaround - This is a cover of the Devo song (yes, they made more than Whip It.) It doesn't sound like Nirvana at all, along with a few more on here. I understand why they covered this (basically every Alternative Rock band has to give credit to Devo, along with The Ramones), but they couldn't find a slightly less happy sounding song to use?<br /><br />(2/5) Molly's Lips - Another sub-par cover. This sounds way too happy, just like Turnaround the song after this. It's not notable, and not long either (there aren't many long songs on here.)<br /><br />(2.5/5) Son Of A Gun - This get bumped up slightly for being a good cover, even if it is too happy. It still makes no sense for Nirvana's sound, at it is over produced again, but, whatever, can't fix it now.<br /><br />(3/5) (New Wave) Polly - A fast version of Polly from Nevermind. That's seriously it, just an electric version of the original.<br /><br />(3/5) Beeswax - The only notable thing about this is the riff. I find this song quite annoying at times. I don't know why, but I always connect this with Big Long Now for some reason.<br /><br />(2/5) Downer - This is completely unnecessary. Bleach was released on CD the same year, and that's how most people bought it. This should have had the far better D-7 in it's place (it was on the Hoarmoaning EP, why couldn't it be on this!?).<br /><br />(3.5/5) Mexican Seafood - Not all that bad, actually. The speech is hard to understand, but other than that it's not terrible. I think it is literally about Mexican Seafood and it's effects on your digestive system (gross.).<br /><br />(3.5/5) Hairspray Queen - This is where it starts to pick back up. This sounds a lot like the Illiteracy Will Prevail demo tape by Kurt's original band, Fecal Matter. I have no idea what it is about, but there is one line that seems to confuse people: \\"I was your mine.\\" Everyone thinks \\"mine\\" is the word meaning \\"I own this,\\" but it really seems to refer to \\"mine\\" as a landmine or a bomb.<br /><br />(3/5) Aero Zeppelin - This song is apparently one giant reference to Aerosmith/Led Zeppelin. It has a nice riff, especially after the first verse. It isn't taken very seriously, and Kurt's voice is kind of annoying. It would have been better if it had been sung in one of his more familiar voices like in \\"Dive\\" or \\"Blew.\\" Itis a good song however.<br /><br />(2/5) Big Long Now - BOOOOOOOOOORING. Nirvana can do five minute songs well like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Heart-Shaped Box, or Radio Friendly Unit Shifter. The difference between those and this is that while those have interesting lyrics and riffs (and don't move at the pace of a snail riding a turtle), THIS is incredibly slow and NEVER changes it's incredibly boring riff. Nothing about this is appealing, just like Sifting from Bleach.<br /><br />(5/5) Aneurysm - Luckily, the album ends on a high note. This is a different version of Aneurysm than the original B-Side (this uses power-chords, the B-Side uses picking.) The lyrics are fantastic, as well as the riff. The singing style is actually kind of funny, and it's obvious that this wasn't taken seriously. It ends te album well enough and I'm glad they picked this to end it instead of one of the covers.<br /><br />While it may not be Nirvana's best release, it's not terrible and it has it's moments.

B005AFB69E|5.0|After reading the excellent reviews from buyers of David Ho (boyoyo) from Hong Kong, I purchased the region-free Bluray. My order was processed quickly and I received an email with shipping info and a link to their web site, which made me feel better about purchasing from overseas. The Bluray arrived sooner than the approximate arrival date (yay!) and I had to sign for it, something I didn't request so the seller must have - another plus for his attention to detail.<br /><br />As for the Bluray itself: fantastic. I had to ask myself if the picture was this clear in the theater (where I saw it three times)! Having since watched the movie on VHS for almost 3 decades, the picture quality is simply phenomenal, crisp and bright - so good that you can see the detail and texture and true color of the costumes even better. You can even see split-second shots which don't show up on the VHS version.<br /><br />My only complaint is that in two night scenes, some shadows appear like grainy dark red blots, like the movie is being watched on an old TV set where the color/contrast/hue needs adjusting. I assume when the movie was being formatted for Bluray that this was a technical problem which couldn't be fixed without affecting the quality of the rest of the shot. Or maybe it has something to do with the disc being region free?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I recommend any Ladyhawke fan to purchase this Bluray. IT'S WORTH THE PRICE.

B000002VMD|1.0|I thought this would be a nice background album to listen to as I enjoyed the movie. It is mostly her singing - not much of the soundtrack. Wish I hadn't bought it - won't ever play it again.

B002Z7FWBI|1.0|I ordered this movie as part of an ongoing project to own every movie I ever watched with my grandmother or that she rented for me. I've mostly relied on amazon for this as they pretty much have a monopoly on hard to find and out of print items. After receiving quite a few pieces of french canadian garbage and letting it slide as they were sent by canadian subcontractors I decided that enough is enough. Today I got this item with the movies intact but the box pretty much broken beyond repair both on the outside and inside. Customer service is pretty much a joke as they hire out people from other countries who could apparently care less about the passion behind my goal of aqquiring every movie I ever saw with my now deceased grandmother as a child and teenager. Someone of importance has 24 hrs to respond to this and either give me my money back or a replacement box (preferably in one piece) or I'm posting a video on my youtube channel thoroughly detailing the many f*** ups I've had to endure in my tenureship ordering from this God forsaken website. If someone important is reading this they got till tommorrow evening to convince me not to post a vid of this product along with some french canadian garbage they've sent me on my youtube channel which a considerable amount of both viewers and subscribers. After that I post a link in this section along with the sections of your no common sense having canadian business partners who lack the common sense to realize that when sending merchandise to people in the states, they should sent them copies with artwork in ENGLISH AND NOT FRENCH !!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love Flipboard!  The first time I used it on an ipad, I said \\"this is what the ipad is meant for.\\"  Works just as well on Android tablets.  The version for phones is still pretty good.  In addition to its graphical goodness (light years above traditional rss readers), Flipboard also does a great job curating content.  I recommend this app to anyone I know who gets a new tablet.
B00006EXCC|5.0|They reached the top with Aftermath, when Brian was innerly forced to give up the guitar to add some other instruments. The first Album, the Stones entirely wrote themself, Jagger/Richards all through. And Brian was the unwelcomed, hopefully aborted founder and secret star of the Stones with his brilliant flavours he added. Here, the Stones sounded like a night club band. When Brian died, they lost their soul and gnawed at the corpse all the further albums to come.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Puzzles are tons of fun.  I hope they come out with  more boards.  It didn't. take long to finish these.
0812550706|2.0|I really cant understand why this book is a classic. I've read a lot of Science Fiction and this one does not stack up to the likes of Iain M Banks for example. Its a story about kids but to be honest it reads like it was written for kids. The characters call each other \\"fart head\\" and this is presented as a cutting insult. The descriptions of the training video games he plays are so dated now, they read like the early text based role playing games \\"you are in a forest, there are different paths, there is a giant\\" etc. I appreciate this was written in the mid 1980s when this was the level of video game available but its not what you then expect to be described in a book set in the future. Final straw for me was early in the book, Ender is an outcast in battle school, he challenges a kid twice his age in one of he battle games and he wins and others start to notice him - what a cliche. No description of how or why he won, nothing clever or inventive or thought provoking. Just lazy writing if you ask me. This book is fine if you're 12 years old but for anyone else I think it will just grate.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Tolle Uhr zum günstigen Preis.Linkshänderuhren kosten sonst sehr viel mehr. Wenn es überhaupt Schöne & Gute gibt.<br />Der Service aus USA über Zoll etc. & in Euro abrechnen finde ich sehr gut!!
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I heard bad press about this movie so I waited until it was on line here, but I really enjoyed it!  I felt it was about how the friends were growing in their life stages and helping each other.  The photography of the Middle East was beautiful and it had a lot of humor in between the points they were making. Really fun for SATC fans! Gorgeous fashion and loved the ending!
0345803485|2.0|I finally gave in and bought this book because of my sister-in -law.  She loved all the books and informed me that Damon from Vamp Diaries was going to play Christian Grey in the movie version of the books.  So I thought what the heck I will give it a try.  What struck me first was how this book was stolen from Twilight.  Clumsy girl who is always falling down, who loves books and has never been in love meets the one guy no girl can have. He is mega rich, can play the piano, is domineering, has copper colored hair and of course, he is heart stopping beautiful.  He also warns her to stay away from him because he is dangerous for her. When she tells him not to stay away, he gasps unbelieving. And he acts like he is from another time period. He speaks like he is 60 rather then 26. Right out of Twilight. Give me a break.  Okay once I got past all of that, I find that when they do have sex, she can have an orgasm at the drop of a hat.  No she has never had one before and no she has never masturbated in all of her 22 years but by the power of a guy she just meet, she can suddenly have many by magic.  The sex just got more and more unbelievable.  They are in the tub and she is giving him a hand job with soap!!  Soap!!  Ouch.  Then she gives him oral sex with the soap still lathered all over him. Yuck.  When they go out to eat later that day, he orders for her, she tells him she wants a diet coke and he over rides her by saying the wine will go better with the meal.  What kind of women in this day and age would let a guy get away with that?  This is romance?  You give this stranger your virginity and then turn over all of your independence along with it.  She is going to sign a contract with him to be submissive to him in all things?  Really?  What is she getting out of it?  A STD?  I am not going to put down anyone who reads this book and likes it or loves it because we all have different opinions and mine is not superior to anyone else but I do wonder how any grown womencould have written this book.  It really does read like a teenager with lots of fantasies and no real experience wrote this book.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable work just as you would imagine. transfer speeds are great. my only gripe is that it didn't come standard with the fire when I purchased it. Though, wireless file transfer work really well on the fire. having the actual cable though, allowed me to root my kindle and test out the capabilities of the mighty tablet.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|What I loved most about the book was that the plot was tightly woven right until the end. The battle \\"scenes\\" are well written (I usually skip over these). It's a definite must-read for fantasy fans. Can't wait for book 2 to be released.
B005NF3LKI|4.0|Although I found my attention drifting after a half hour, it was quickly regained with other-worldly vocals and great lyrics to boot.<br /><br />4 stars because some excitement was lost midway through, but the set on this album is worth hearing over and over again.

B005LAIHR2|2.0|Wow! I actually watched my youth destroyed tonight. Virtually every song I ever loved was butchered by a nasal Julianna Hough. Diego Boneta, a name I had never heard before tonight wasn't too bad. The scene with Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand singing, \\"Candle in the Wind\\" by REO Speedwagon was the final nail in my coffin. Although they were not half bad, it was disturbing. That song was an anthem of love for teen girls in the 80's. I don't think I will ever get that image out of my head. Tom Cruise's character Stacy Jaxx reminded me of what I think he would be like in real life, a total space cadet.<br /><br />I had not idea it was a musical when I got there. I now understand it was a musical, but is there such a thing as too much music in a musical? I had to laugh or I would have cried. I am not sure if this was supposed to be a tribute to the 80's or if it was meant to mock everything that was fun about the 80's. At least my son and I had a good laugh. I plan to buy the dvd for people in my life that I want to ruin their youth too. I expect it to sell for less than a dollar.
B007N0REX6|5.0|R&FNR (the predecessor to Apocalyptic Love) was a fantastic Album.  Apocalyptic Love continues in the Slash tradition of powerful melodies, energetic solos, and memorable Riffs.  One of the songs from the album \\"Anastasia\\" really demonstrates the musical diversity that makes up Slash's signature style.  Myles Kennedy sings on the entire album, to my great delight.  He brings the energy of Axl with the non-falsetto range of Plant, in a stunning performance.  I was glad to see Slash include him on the entire album.  Apocalyptic Love is reintroducing Rock n Roll to a society that has become apathetically accustomed to basic power chords and blaze' vocal performances.  Add this to your collection.
006197806X|4.0|Wow, that's pretty much all I can say. This was an amazing book, describing Lena's times in the Wilds and how many other groups there are that face the hardships of being outcast by society. This is an amazing series, and you should read them. However, I think you should wait until next year spring, because that's when the final book comes out, and you don't have to wait with the cliffhanger ending of this book.<br /><br />Now there are going to be some spoilers, so if you haven't read the book, you should stop reading now, or the whole book is going to be ruined.<br /><br />I'd like to share my thoughts on the ending of this book. I can't believe that Alex is alive. I mean, I saw it coming and all, but seriously? I really hope this doesn't turn into another stupid twilight book, where  the main precise of the book is Lena picking who she wants to be with (that is the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars). I don't know what might happen next, but I really hope the next book isn't a let down. When I first read the ending, I was thinking really? You're going to have it be like that? But then again, there might have not been much of a story if Lauren Oliver didn't throw that out there. I really hope this next book proves to be good, because this is such a wonderful series. Can't wait until next spring! :)

1451608659|4.0|A truly great story; mesmerizing and thought-provoking.  I didn't realize the depth of the problem with national gymnastics; I hope somehow the system can be changed to be more fair.  I followed the Magnificent Seven and had no idea how they became a team and how different the reality was when cameras were off.  Dominique was very brave and strong to write this compelling memoir.  I highly recommend it.  (And YIKES, I sent my daughter to the Ranch for a one-week camp one summer!  She said she only saw the K's for a few minutes when they arrived)

030758836X|4.0|What a thriller! Of course we all try to guess and predict exactly what will happen next in every book we read and movie we watch, but this one got me several times. To imagine that another could go in to such depth to exact revenge is chilling. I agree that the end was somewhat melodramatic for me, but maybe I was just hoping for something different!<br />This is a hard book to review without letting some spoilers fly, so I will just sum this up with...if you enjoy a good mystery, you will love this one!

B008KTA64S|5.0|The thing I give Gaslight Anthem so much credit for, is that through 4 albums and 1 E.P., I can listen to their entire discography, and never skip a song.  There aren't many bands I can do that with... MAYBE 1 or 2 others.<br /><br />Handwritten continues that streak.  It's just good rock and roll... it's not too punk, not too pop... it's sort of the Bruce Springsteen/John Cougar/Tom Petty of the ages... no gimmicks, no experimentation, no digital screeching or wub wubs, no samplers, no attempts at rapping.  Just good old fashion rock and roll... the way it's supposed to be.<br /><br />The forefathers of Rock and Roll would be proud.

0142001104|5.0|This book MAY change your life!  And I do NOT say that very lightly.  As it states in the intro, this is a book of \\"practices\\".  And what makes life better other than practice.  So I find myself routinely using these practices many years after I read the book, on an almost daily basis.  I even bought a second copy, which I wrote an anonymous note on the inside of the cover and left the book for someone else to find.  I asked them to pay it forward when they were finished with the book.

B003I4LF3G|5.0|From the very beginning this film grabs a hold of your heart strings and won't let go. The acting is truly excellent. The worst and the best sides of human nature are seen in almost every scene. That John Merrack really lived, just makes the story all the more poignant. I  hope that we, as human beings would treat the less fortunate amongst us better today, but I am not sure that we would.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a fast read. Meaining, once you start you cannot stop.  Asside from the explicit sex, there is a great romantic story.  And it is a great introduction to the many ways sex can be achieved. I enjoyed it.  Great book to read.  I had no choice but to buy the other two books and wished there were more.  I wanted the story to continue and hopefully it will. I finished reading all three books in a few days.  Like I said, it was a great story.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I love this movie. Love. It's very weird that the first thought that comes to mind after having seen this is: &#34;these guys are adorable&#34;. I don't know why this movie isn't better known; it's hysterical. If I had any complaints, it would be that the jokes sometimes have too much of a lead up, you kind of see the punch line coming a few times. It's hardly trite, though-for example, I would have hardly expected to truly like Allison like I did. (She turns out to be every bit as likable as our poor protagonists.) Bear in mind that this is comparable to &#34;Army of Darkness&#34;, and can be quite violent at moments. For me, this adds to the humor and to the plot, because it's more apt and surprising in it's rampant silliness. You honestly can't predict just how stupid the characters are going to get-which is hilarious. This is so original. I've already seen it over and over. Never gets old.<br />I had to go back and give this five stars after watching a Kevin Spacey movie. It was a pleasant antidote.
B007SGM084|1.0|It's a shame that a writer like this will become, if not already, a rich person. Her vocabulary is very limited, the plot is thin and when she starts her sex scenes, which are way too many, you can depend on her limited use of words as though she has simply cut and pasted paragraph after paragraph. I started skimming these parts trying to find the plot. I read it because of its popularity, but sorry that I contributed to her wealth.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins, picks up right where The Hunger Games left off with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark as they take part in the Victor Tour of the Districts. While on the tour, Katniss discovers what appears to be an uprising in some of the districts and unbeknownst to her she is the cause of this rebellion. When she and Peeta eventually make it back home to District 12 they find that the Peacekeepers have taken over and have basically stripped everyone of their freedom and have threatened or even killed numerous citizens. Katniss feels horrible that all of this was caused by her actions so she makes a plan to escape while she is in the woods one day.<br /><br />Read my entire review at:[...]

B005KR6NS6|1.0|I adore dance movies, and normally I will sit through anything in this genre just to see the dancing - which is usually quite good. This film was an exception. I could forgive its lack of plot, its lifeless acting, its stilted dialogue, and the utter lack of chemistry between Pablo and Sally - but I simply could not forgive the awful dancing. Face it, Potter is a zombie on the dance floor. She has no energy, no spark, no fluidity. Veron had enough verve for the two of them (and it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for Veron to show off), but that does not compensate for his completely unconvincing dance partner. Why would anyone doing performance tango (which, by the way, absolutely cannot be learned after a lesson in \\"walking\\" and a trip to Buenos Aires) choose a marionette for a partner? It made no sense. (Well, alright, nothing really made sense in this film.) The one good scene in this film was when Potter goes to Buenos Aires and gets on the floor with a portly older gentleman. THAT is how you dance a tango. Veron could take a lesson or two from that guy.

B000002KYH|5.0|This was recorded at the heighth of his career in the earlier 80's. Many of the songs are great, the Chuck Berry songs are fantastic. The others are fine, also. Hot Legs,Tonight's the Night,Young Turks,Maggie May,Sailing,etc...but,my favorites are the two great dance tracks,Da Ya Think I'm Sexy and Passion. Both of these rock and are fast pace,great musicianship. Really,one could collapse in a fit of nervous exhaustion bugalooing to them. Both are better than the twelve inchers. Now hold on a minute before we go much further, Give me a dime so I can call my mother. That's so cute! PS Rod, thank you for \\"Georgie\\" you'll never know how much you touched us.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This release is modern science looking out for us music lovers. As well, the great friendship thriving among these men have paved my road for a concert trip. I hope they play most of this album on their fall tour. New sounds abound from all three. BRAVO!<br />...I should add that the lyrics are poetry and should be read. And for those that refuse, maybe a band-aid box would provide some entertainment, and I mean attainment. Sorry, it just seems that some humans are struggling and I don't mean to be cynical, I mean to just say....WAKE UP!!!!!
B003UYV08E|4.0|My daughters are just the right age to enjoy the comic book nature of the stories, and the movie is entertaining for my husband and I as well.  We love Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenneth Paltrow, and their characters are great together.
B0085W6II8|2.0|This thing sounds like the darker side of Steve and the uh..side of Chris without punch. Translated...VERY compressed. And really are aliens just us from the future??? I thought there were like 17 documented types representing obviously different planetary atmospheric conditions. Rubbish.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I am so excited for this blu ray release that I am jumping up and down and having trouble breathing. That is do to the fact that this blu ray set will have restored picture and sound plus seven hours of bonus content. STFU people who don't want to buy it because it includes the horrible Kingdom of the Crystal.<br />Besides that horrible movie you get an awesome boatload of goodies. One of those goodies is a frame by frame restoration of Raiders of the lost ark from its original 35 mm elements. plus a blu ray book like the star wars blu ray release, where the discs are situated nicely with poster art and pictures. Do not forget the temple of doom and the last crusade digitally remastered sound and picture. The thing that you should be excited about most is the bonus disc with seven hours of archival content, commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, and rare moments from the set, so quit your bitchin' and moanin' and buy the damn thing. You should be proud to want to get it and besides you can always throw the KOTCS disc in the trash or dispose of it as you want if you are that fussy. Anyway I hopefully will get this as a christmas gift as I will be begging for it. And no I don't have any after spending it on ET and Jaws blu rays which are ones that you guys should look into if you are reading this review and check out my other reviews on the ET and Jaws blu rays. Hoped this review helped. so bye!
B007ZBWJXI|1.0|The best song is probably the first track which is timely to a real world view. After that there are no new and deserving keyboard sounds and no new atmospherics. In fact the bonus track of How You Feel should have been the actual original. The first take on How you Feel sounds like Supertramp's Child Of Vision from Breakfast not only for the keyboards but also the bass line. C'mon!! And where is Steve on this record anyway?? He is only sneaking in a few parts. All said and done, maybe tracks 2 and 3 are worth downloading and maybe Face on the Bridge. But really Judas! Judas! blah blah blah.<br />I only hope that Geoff Downes doesn't wreck the Yes concert I am about to attend.<br />This is just fancy make a buck packaging. Don't expect Wildest Dreams quality on this one.

0307719774|4.0|This came in the mail today. I thought it was so neat. I love the formatting, the questions, the size, etc. I'm sure that, because it's so small, it will be a bit difficult to write in but it's alright. It will be easily legible. I showed this to my sister and she fell in love with it too, demanding I get her one for the closest holiday. It's great to get the creative juices flowing. I'm excited to see how my answers will change year to year.

B004YJZ5TO|5.0|I recently purchased this DVD because I am a big fan of Cung Le.  The acting was not bad considering Le's first major role.  It's good to see Van Damme back at it after his early blood sport years.  This movie is obviously for action and fighting scenes.<br /><br />The fighting scenes look real and I enjoyed the character of \\"Jonesy\\" who plays one of the bad guys.  \\"Jonesy\\" should have played more because he looks more like a gangster than the other casted members.  Anyways, overall good movie for entertainment for fights!

B00846TTDG|5.0|First of all I'd like to say what this film is; a tribute film. This movie seeks to pay tribute to the US Navy SEALs and servicemen and women. Those who cry that the film is too patriotic or serves as a recruitment tool don't seem to understand the goal of this film. Again it is a tribute film and to that extent it hugely succeeds, it is not a film that will be winning any Academy Awards due to it's stiff acting and somewhat typical plot but I didn't watch it for all that. I wanted a look at our SEALs in action and I walked away extremely satisfied.<br /><br />Also, for those saying that this film will brainwash youngsters into joining SEALs or military I'd suggest you think again. BUD/s (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL or boot camp for SEALs) has a drop out rate of typically 70% to even 90%. Statistically speaking everyone who tries to become SEALs won't even make it. It takes an individual of extreme mental and physical endurance to complete BUD/s and the ability to break all barriers within your way. Allow youngsters to make decisions for themselves and be satisfied with whatever decision they ultimately make, any mistake they make they will learn firsthand and hopefully never repeat again.<br /><br />I loved this film for the action (the best I've ever seen!). The scene at the end made me tear up in the theater and I found this film hitting very close to home. Know what you want out of a movie and understand what type of film you're about to watch. For those who love military films like We Were Soldliers, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, Flags of our Fathers this film won't disappoint. For those expecting a film that portrays our military negatively I'd suggest you search elsewhere.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|As long as I've been listening to music, the Foo Fighters have been one of my favorite bands.  I first came conscious of them with [[ASIN:B000QEIORG THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE]], and I've bought all of their records within the first week of release since.  One of my favorite things about the band is that no two albums sound quite the same.  This time around, the band's is refined (or roughened) with the help of producer Butch Vig.  The alternative pop-rock that propelled [[ASIN:B000020617 THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE]] was nowhere to be found in their next album.  The gloomy moods of [[ASIN:B00006JO4T ONE BY ONE]] weren't repeated in [[ASIN:B0009HLDFU IN YOUR HONOR.]]  In 2011's WASTING LIGHT, the band mostly sheds its acoustics for rougher edges -- the nuance and versatility of [[ASIN:B00138JAUY ECHOES, SILENCE, PATIENCE, & GRACE]] has been traded in for a brawling brand of rock-n-roll that was hinted in more recent albums.  One thing is for sure though: Dave Grohl & company are able to create tunes just as melodic and solid as anything they've ever done.<br /><br />Opening track \\"Bridge Burning\\" pulls no punches -- it begins the album on one of its heavier tracks.  This song and \\"White Limo\\" form some of the heaviest tracks the Foo Fighters have ever released.  The aggression isn't wasted: these songs are tumbling, rocking tracks.  The second track is WASTING LIGHT's lead single, \\"Rope.\\"  The song finds Grohl crooning over the sharp, rough verses before giving way to the melodic and powerful chorus.  One of my favorites off the album (though I recognize it's not the best) is \\"Arlandria,\\" a song about Grohl's hometown roots.  The song exemplifies one of my favorite things about the Foo Fighters: their albums are chock-full of great songs, even those that don't serve well as radio-singles (this song seemed to get the least amount of attention compared to others).  \\"These Days\\" begins a bit more mellow before diving into a brawling chorus -- Grohl's has a natural talent for pulling melodies out of songs, and this song is a great examples.  \\"I Should Have Known,\\" the albums penultimate track, is probably the most sonically interesting on the album.  Where most of WASTING LIGHT relegates itself to standard guitar-based arrangements, this song feels a little bluesy and a little more heart-felt than others.  The album closes with \\"Walk;\\" it's an optimistic song that stands out for it's happier attitude.  In an album full of aggression and angst, \\"Walk\\" ends the album on a good note.<br /><br />I was going to originally give this album 4 stars out of 5, because it is one of the Foo Fighters' albums that I revisit the least.  Putting things into perspective though, even though this album isn't the band's strongest, it's so much better than many albums that are released each year.  Additionally, it's incredibly consistent -- there's not a bad song in the entire bunch.<br /><br />When most bands lately seem to tamper down their rougher edges using Pro-Tools, synthesizers, or electronics, the Foo Fighters move in the opposite direction: WASTING LIGHT is the band's roughest, heaviest album to date.  Essential tracks to download: \\"Rope,\\" \\"White Limo,\\" \\"These Days,\\" and \\"Walk.\\"  If you have any interest in the Foo Fighters, be sure to check out this album.nt for pulling melodies out of songs, and this song is a great examples.  \\"I Should Have Known,\\" the albums penultimate track, is probably the most sonically interesting on the album.

0446541478|2.0|Overall, this was a very interesting and enlightening read about the complex yet highly successful business culture in Israel. However, at times, information was omitted or inaccurate, turning it into propaganda and cheapening the content.<br /> Ex. U.S. immigration policy banned Asian immigrants in the 1800s and early 1900s, not to mention the treatment of African \\"American\\" non-citizens. The last time I checked, zero was a numerical limit. I make no accusations, but it seemed to me that this section was an attempt to emotionally manipulate the reader, which I did not appreciate. In the same area, the authors also omitted Israel's policy on immigration for non-Jews (I wonder why...not so indiscriminate perhaps?), although I am no expert, I think violence has broken out in Israel due to African immigrants recently as well as law changes for the spouses of Jews. (However, these developments may be more recent than this book's publication). Their comparisons between Israel and other \\"similar\\" countries are also unfair, including Singapore, but especially Korea. Korea's strength is in manufacturing (unlike Israel's which is in tech.) and since South Korea has its own stock market, it is unfair to compare it with Israel on the NASDAQ. Korea has also established international brands, which Israel has admittedly failed to do.<br />I recommend this book for its insight into Israeli life, culture, and economy without the political overtures frequently imposed on other literature. However, readers shouldn't take its information as fact. Statistics are too easily manipulated, and info has (as I mentioned) clearly been omitted where convenient.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I try not to read too many books where the main characters are teenagers/young adults. The SLAMMED series is one to break that rule for.  I lean towards SLAMMED being my favorite over POINT OF RETREAT but they are both 'butterflying' good books!  WIth this series you are taken on an emotional roller coaster - laughter, tears, and innocent romance.  A wonderful read for summer!

0805095535|3.0|The cover copy describes this as an \\"unconventional memoir in which [Auster] writes about his mother's life and death.\\" Which is true, but only up to a point. There is one section that deals particularly with the life and death of Auster's mother, but it takes up only about 35 of 230 pages. That material, which also appeared in Granta 117, is easily the strongest in WINTER JOURNAL. Poignant, vivid, imbued simultaneously with his sense of his mother's individual tragedy and his awareness that on another level she must always remain a mystery to him, it's a model of the personal essay. Unfortunately, what surrounds it is (barring a charmingly sentimental description of his second marriage) formless, frequently dull recollections that neither capture Auster's visceral experience nor reveal anything about the human condition. It's all well-written on a basic level, full of long sentences that flow naturally and are never difficult to parse, but beyond that ease of reading there are few rewards.<br /><br />In Michael Chabon's WONDER BOYS, a character critiques the protagonist's still-incomplete gargantuan novel by suggesting that the inclusion of such details as \\"the genealogies of the horses\\" represents an inability to focus. WINTER JOURNAL is very short, but betrays a similar failure of focus. Nearly 60 pages are given over to a descriptive list of Auster's 21 permanent addresses over the years. There's also a catalog of scars and the stories behind them. Of course one appreciates the intimations of mortality and resulting reflections on the past that drove Auster to make these lists, but for readers lacking their own intimations and reflections, the resonance of this journal may be minimal. None of the homes and scars and snacks are described intensely enough for them to live on in the reader's mind as they do on Auster's, and so they are easily forgotten when another topic juts into frame. There is something to be said for an unconventional, unstructured approach to memoir, but there's also something to be said for a center of gravity, without which such a book becomes a weightless series of reminiscences. For admirers of Auster, especially those interested in his life, and for those who like him are inspired by middle age to consider the sheer vastness of a single life, WINTER JOURNAL may be worth an afternoon's perusal; for others, there is no particular reason to read it at all.memoir, but there's also something to be said for a center of gravity, without which such a book becomes a weightless series of reminiscences.

I am a collector, and it is very disappointing when you open a vynil and it is already NM or VG condition as opposed to Mint, as it has to be when never played. I will try to fix this with Amazon, but this is the 3rd vynil I order through them and  I have had problems with 2 already.

1468179993|5.0|There are probably a million worthwhile ideas out there that are not expressed and will never get to TED to be spread to the world. This book helps change that which is wonderful.  I am extremely grateful that Jeremey Donovan studied so many TED speeches to capture their secrets. His book is filled with excellent advice about creating TED talks, as well as, public speaking in general. It is clear, concise, and an easy read. I have a tendency to underline parts of a book I want to come back to and reread. After a few pages I realized I was going to underlying the whole book. Whenever I hear a good idea worth spreading I will highly recommend this book. I already have and will continue. I would love to see more.

He could see her again.<br /><br />David went to the club with her.<br />After that he confessed that his entire family passed away when he was still young.<br />After that... you know?

But I couldn't. This story is going too fast to catch my heart.<br />I even felt his background shouldn't be so as David seems to be raised in happy family as far as my opinion.<br />My favorite is Anthony(Harry) he's so cute and I like his way of speeking. so sweet.<br />Good thing about this film for me is not so thrilling like action films as my heart doesn't resist to watch it.

044654759X|5.0|I have wanted to buy the book for several months now, admittedly because I was attracted to the cover (a true safe haven image). It was very... Janet Hill Etsy kind of thing.<br /><br />But then I opened the first page, read on as I waited at the airport for more than two hours to go home. Kept on reading on the plane. Arrived home at past midnight. Crawled into bed, and read again until 3:30 in the morning. Before the story got to the final suspence, my eyes gave up and I slept. This morning, I picked it up again and finished it in a desperate pool of tears. It was great. Perhaps I needed an outlet to cry (too many things happened as of late), and this book gave me just that. But the book was also a mind gripper on its own. I still can't believe that such things can happen (in essence) to a woman like Katie, but I also know it to be true. Sad, but these things still happen in the real world, and not always with the pretty ending...<br /><br />Another reviewer was right. Don't, DO NOT peek at the ending! RESIST the temptation. It will TOTALLY ruin the surprise for you.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't. I accidentally brushed to the last page when I opened the book after getting some water, but I'm glad I didn't read through it. I had a very nice surprise, a very sweet nice surprise waiting for me at the end.<br /><br />I learned that the book is to be made into a movie. I hope it will do the book justice.<br /><br />Totally recommended. Five stars.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|this game is pretty silly, but it is fun to play for a few minutes.  after that it gets a little boring.  it is fun to watch my 3 yr old trying to solve.
0385360177|1.0|The novel itself was less than brilliant; the main character (Anastasia, I mean who's named Anastasia?) is pathetic.  And her cohort (Christian, again, who's named...?) is so far-fetched, even a science fiction buff would have trouble believing in his character.  The DVD version is positively torture.  The narrator has a nasal, pre-pubescent and very irritating voice.  And the narration is way over the top.  Ergo, when narrating the email conversations between the two main characters, please do skip the sixteen different readings of \\"To, From Subject, Date & Time\\".  Really, in the first disc, there's an email banter between the two characters, say four emails each, and the narrator reads the email headers out each and every time.  Twenty minutes into the this portion of the chapter, and probably seventeen of it was narration of email headers.  Awful, monotonous and really, just about the worst read I've ever had.  After three chapters, I cannot bear it anymore.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|This is an incredible package for a true fab4 disciple. As I started watching the film I felt I was back in the Miracle Theatre in  1965! The restoration on the film is excellent!! The added bonus featurettes are very impressive and very entertaining regarding the making of the film. The entire package including the script and poster and added booklet make it all worth while. It is a package to be enjoyed on a saturday night with popcorn! Lots of reading and finally the feature film with all the extras! You will not be disappointed!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book; true to Baldacci style and great characters.  This book had a character similar to other books, but with a soft side, more personal development for the hero.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It keeps you entertained for hours. Cute graphics. Unlike a lot of games out there you don't have to rely on limited energy levels. The only downside is its hard to put down!

1451626657|4.0|We've all experienced the catch-22 of being at the dentist's office, with the dentist all up in your mouth, while you're asked that question that you're expected to answer.  How can you talk while the dentist has his hands in your mouth?  Classic catch-22!<br /><br />I started reading \\"Catch-22' by Joseph Heller, and was incredibly surprised (and delighted at the coincidence) of a catch-22 that I experienced just yesterday.<br /><br />I have been a teacher for 5 years and my husband's job has us moving in the near future, so my job is going to change.  We'll be in transit somewhat and I figured a good option for me would be to substitute teach.  Denver, Colorado requires a background check with paper fingerprints (like getting the prints done on paper with ink), not digital like my county in Florida currently requires.  The Colorado Department of Education says to just show up or call ahead to a law enforcement office to get the prints done and the law enforcement office will take care of everything.  Unforunately, the Colorado Department of Education doesn't provide the paper fingerprinting form and neither do the law enforcement agencies!  How am I supposed to get fingerprinted, which is a requirement, but no one will let me have a card for the prints?  After many more phone calls, I found a way to order the cards, but still, that's a great catch-22, and such a welcome coincidence since I was currently reading the book!<br /><br />\\"Catch-22' by Joseph Heller was definitely a unique story.  I've never read a book quite like it!  Yossarian is a bombardier in the military in Italy who does anything he can to get out of flying his missions and to be sent home.  Unfortunately, every time he completes the required amount of missions, or gets close to it, the mission requirement is upped.  Also preventing him (and the other men) from leaving is the fateful Catch-22, which says that \\"a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.\\"  So you're crazy for flying the missions and should be sent home, but just asking to be relieved means you're sane enough to keep flying!<br /><br />\\"Catch-22' is filled with catch 22's and quirky scenarios.  One scenario has a doctor who is terrified of flying and has bombardiers lie to say he is with them in the plane (since he is required to fly a certain amount of hours).  On one of these instances, the plane crashes and those aboard die.  Since the doctor did not bail out (even though he is standing there with other soldiers watching the plane crash), the doctor must be dead.  His wife is informed, he stops being paid and fed, etc.<br /><br />\\"Catch-22' is a witty, quirky story where it seems that every situation has its idiocracy and a catch 22.  I would recommend it mainly because it's so different from anything I've read and it was humorous.  I wouldn't laugh out loud, but you have to give the book some credit for making me SMILE when someone dies, based on the irony of the death.t if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.\\"  So you're crazy for flying the missions and should be sent home, but just asking to be relieved means you're sane enough to keep flying!<br /><br />\\"Catch-22 is filled with catch 22s and quirky scenarios.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've been reading 1-star reviews of 50 Shades for about an hour and they are all spot on! This book is beyond AWFUL. I found myself locked in a battle of wills with the author; forcing myself to slog through her terrible, repetitive writing, her characters so boring that I just didn't care what happened to them, and her lifeless, uninspiring sex scenes in the vain hope that eventually a plot would develop.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />For all of you who are disgusted with yourselves for reading this, may I suggest that you soothe your soul with a good laugh? The parody: Fifty Shades of Silver Hair and Socks, by Phil Torcivia is a riot!
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|I love these people, \\" ooooohhh It's not like the soap opera\\" ooooohhhh. Tim Burton made it clear from the start it was to be a spoof and a comedy. Geeze, get a life.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the last book of the Hunger Games series, although it did seem a bit more gruesome than the other two.  Clearly the book could not have an ending without Katniss having to choose between Peeta And Gale unless one of them was killed.

B005EXA8LY|4.0|All of the people that gave any stars less than a 3 should read the current (August 2012) interview in 'Guitar Player' with Steve Wilson and understand the reasoning behind this album and the mind of this very creative and talented artist. I love Porcupine Tree very much and Blackfeild and No-Man and the many other groups this prodigy has going on. Steve Wilson is very under rated here in America and seldom written about in any of our music magazines.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|My cable came with the kindle, did not purchase separate.<br /><br />This kindle cable is perfect, until after about 3 or more years of owning... What happens after 3 or more years, is it starts to mold and it falls apart. There is nothing left except the wires on my 2nd generation kindle... :(
B008JGSM6G|5.0|extremely fun game i love it :) its a fun challenging game that gets ur mind going try it i really suggest this game if ur bired or just want something to do :)
0553582038|5.0|I have no idea why so many disliked this book. I thought it was excellent. I am very excited about the next one.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app used to be awesome. but now it wont play anything. slow refresh of playlists. hanging buffering. network errors.<br /><br />I was buying my music through amazon but i'm going to go back to itunes and google drive/player.<br /><br />I dont want an update to my phone to fix the problem. i want an update to this app. google play works fine. full streaming netflix works fine. youtube works fine. but amazon mp3 cant play a music file?<br /><br />why would i buy an amazon android device (kindle fire) if they cant even get a streaming music app right?!
B007VDN1PA|1.0|I do not recommend  this scanner. The DBTech scanner does a very poor job on negatives although it is very easy to use. Scans of our negatives were too poor of a quality to use, so I had them scanned at a photo shop instead.

0099579936|1.0|Please flush (don't blush)...this book down the next available drain<br />I would like to invite the author of this atrocious bit of (I'm sorry, I don't have a name for it) to my place of work, a club. On day one she would get to meet about a thousand people who dress in 50 shades of black, wear military style uniforms and lace dresses and dance to ESM/industrial music. Listening in on their conversations maybe she will get a glimpse of what a real subculture involving BDSM looks like. On day two I would \\"torture\\"<br /> her by locking her in the bathroom during a gay/lesbian party, to see what uninhibited kinky really is about. Apart from the nonexistent plot and the bad writing, the sex in this book is very, for want of a better word, vanilla. Not even an honest vanilla, but an artificially flavoured with lots of E numbered ingredients vanilla...If you want to read porn find something better, if you want to read about love try Shakespeares Sonnets. On another note, why do the girls in these books always have to be \\"fragile\\" and too skinny? Apparently you can never be too skinny...so ditch that concept please, I long to read about female bodybuilders forced into submissiom!

1400069289|2.0|Even the simple minded would get bored with this book. Too much reiterating of ideas, long stories that bring us to a very small conclusion. Once it delved into the AA stuff . . . the whole story etc ... I decided to stop listening. I think that was towards the end anyway. I have to say, this is a very interesting topic, I'm amazed how poorly presented this is, for 4th graders it seemed.<br />I'm also surprised that so many people gave it so many stars. All I can think is that we're hungry for what the book could be about, so we're asking for more complete and informative books by voting with our ratings?<br />If you want a lot of relevant information about habits - look for another book - when you find one please let me know.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|After being set down a little forcefully entire ear cup fell off the headset. Won't glue back together. way too delicate and hisses when i plays sounds.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I am not much into musicals, but this one is awesome!! If you're an Abba fan you'll love this movie. The songs are original scores adapted & re-written for the movie. Who knew Meryl Streep could sing ... she was great. I'm a huge Pierce Brosnan fan, (best James Bond protrayer - sorry Sean fans) BUT, the man can not sing! The story line is very good, and the supporting cast is great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is solitaire...you either get the game and love to play it or you don't get it which makes it less then enjoyable. I also think it is neat that they let you change the cards looks and the background.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|This is by far one of the best action movies I own. If you seek action, suspense and a get even plot with Washington beaurocrats then this is the movie for you. This one of Mark Wahlbergs best in my opinion. Rhona Mitra is HOT HOT HOT !!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was first not going to bother playing this game, but I found the free version and thought what the heck. Needless to say it is fun and it is nice how they update it and give you more levels. Most of the time they only do that for  the versions you have to buy.

1613771355|5.0|The publisher's website, Conlanpress.com, has the standard version and the deluxe version signed and personalized by Peter - they mention nothing about numbered but I expect those were gone in a wink!  Peter will autograph your book with a personalized message, which is plenty long enough for a really special note or some prose.  You may want more than one copy, or the original and the deluxe - the deluxe is so heart-swellingly beautiful that it's hard to look at it for long all at once, you start to get lost in it!

B000FQJAIW|5.0|In 1977, on a cold, rainy night in Inverness, Scotland a wee farm-girl saw a film called Star Wars. After that night everything was different. The original Star Wars (A New Hope) literally changed my life. At that point in my life I was living on a dirt poor farm and my whole life consisted of that little farm.<br /><br />I remember my parents telling me we were going to see it and I was not particularly excited though I did notice the boys in my family who were going were actually jumping for joy.<br /><br />I can tell you the instant I saw the first scene I knew it was something beyond special. I sat there in the cinema for two hours just so strongly spellbound that I froze in my seat. When the film ended I sat there trying to grasp what had just happened. To say my universe blossomed after that night would be the biggest understatement of my life.<br /><br />After the film my interest in the universe around me exploded so much sometimes I would get overwhelmed trying to get a grasp on it. I can say with no reservation, this film was directly responsible for me going to University and thus my success in life. I can also say after the birth of my children it was one of the most paramount events in my life.<br /><br />Our little farm became so tiny that I would get frustrated and begged my mum to take me to the library so I could study astronomy, physics, geology, religion, history, film, and the list goes on and on. I felt that this amazing door opened and the world transformed into this plaything for me to explore and understand.<br /><br />I ended up getting two Master degrees and for my first one my thesis was on Star Wars. I felt it was a way to honour something that without I probably would not have been interested in going to school at all.<br /><br />I know I gush and gush but there is just something magical about this film (and its sequels) that just tickles this special place in my psyche. It was the first full length film that I watched with all three of my children. Needless to say our house became a vessel to hold all of their Star Wars toys. I remember watching the looks on their faces as they watched and could see that same spellbound child that existed in 1977 in Inverness. I still tear up thinking about these two great influences in my life coming together and becoming something bigger than itself.<br /><br />I know most of you have seen the film many times but take some time to watch it again and for goodness sake may the force be with you!my children.

0547569653|5.0|I've been reading about Scott Jurek for years and he's been a role model for me - a successful ultrarunner, a vegan advocate, and a seemingly kind, generous person. This memoir describes his evolution from a dorky Minnesota kid to an ultrarunning legend - with plenty of recipes and training tips thrown in for fun. There's been plenty of joy and anguish in Jurek's life and he's out there through it all pounding out the tough, lonely miles. Maybe this book isn't for everybody; but it was right up my alley and I couldn't wait to read it each night as I train for a 50K ultrarun of my own.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves to read this book. We are introducing the potty and this book seems to help. Simple graphics, easy read. I would recommend it for both boys and girls.
B005D51JQQ|1.0|I love Sting.  Always loved the Police.  I enjoyed the Police reunion and bit on the dabblings in the Labyrinth.  But then it was Symphonicities.  then Live in Berlin.  And now this.  An unbearably over priced package.  Even having all the tracks, I would have still bought it because it's Sting, for completeness sake.  But, you have to draw a line somewhere.  Perhaps these unoriginal music events of the past decade have no discernable causal connection.  Or maybe they do.  I'll wait for Synchronicity III.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I have to say I wasn't a big Katy Perry fan from the beginning of her career but she grew on me and I love all of the singles she's released from this album and all of the other songs on there also.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I tried reading this book as it seemed so popular, but I never finished it and returned it for a refund. The writing style, plot and characters are weak. I just don't get what all the hype is about.
034580404X|5.0|I love this series...I originally bought the books separately and had already read it twice.  I had to get the boxed set.  I honestly haven't read an actual novel since high school and I could not put this series down.  I have to say this is my favorite series of all time.  I am reading other series but I think this will forever be my favorite.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I got hooked as soon as I figured it out. It was very easy to play! Have as fun as did!
B001EOOQEC|5.0|First of all I want to start off by saying I'm a Sabbath fan and I love all eras, but Ronnie James Dio is by far my favorite vocalist. I really enjoyed Heaven & Hell as well as Mob Rules and I consider Live Evil to be one of the BEST heavy metal live albums (we get to hear Dio do some of the classic Sabbath songs on there), but more importantly I love Dehumanizer it's very different from both the earlier work he did with Sabbath as well as his much lighter solo career. A lot of the negative reviews I've read on here have complained about how dark and heavy this album was, but its BLACK SABBATH! This album is pure heavy metal and I for one love Dio's angry snarling vocals on this album and would recommend it to any heavy metal fan. Stand out tracks on this album would be Computer God, After all (the dead), TV Crimes, Buried Alive, and I. Take a chance there's more to Sabbath than Ozzy.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|I usually like Bonamassa's work and this CD is no exception.  There are some really superb cuts on this recording.  However, I wish recording artists would avoid the temptation to lay down 30 seconds of someone talking/rambling (such as you hear at one point on this CD), as it rarely adds anything to the artistic effort and frequently detracts.  That said, the majority of this CD definitely contains material worth having in your Blues collection.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|So far I've had no issues with this processor. It's a nice upgrade over the dual core processor I was running. The sad thing is that these are becoming super hard to find and I don't know that I really want to go to the 8 core processors. If I have to replace my mobo after this, I think I'm going to go intel.

B0039TD826|1.0|\\"Greatest\\" album? What a load of hogwash! Though familiar with the Stones from the first time I heard 'Gomper' at a Masonic youth dinner in 1968, I really turned on to the Stones in 1986 when 'Winning Ugly' was burning up the Canadian charts. If you want some great rock music I suggest you check out Dirty Work or Undercover, or Bill Wyman's second solo album Stone Alone. Mick's first solo album She's the Boss is up there as well.

0679735909|4.0|This book was recommended as a good choice for after \\"The Winter Sea.\\" It has a bit of the same tone; but, that is where it ends. The story follows two scholar-types who start to unravel a poet mystery. The narrative goes back and forth between current time and history. I enjoyed the overall story, narrative, and conclusion. (The only part I could have done without was the actual poetry.) This is a long and satisfying read for anyone who enjoys literary history and mystery!
B00846REIS|5.0|I almost didn't read it because of the reviews..<br />I just finished reading this book. It is NOT 50 Shades \\"word for word\\"  I appreciate this book for what it is! To me...it's more believable than 50 Shades of Grey. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading the 50 Shades Trilogy, it was completely unlike any book I've read before...but the repeats got annoying quickly !<br /><br />I can't wait to read book 2 in the Crossfire Series  : )

The extraordinary introductory materials and the Kindle Oxford dictionary are a valuable tool to understand and enjoy Shakespeare. Notes on the actual text would help.

B002ZG9800|1.0|I don't enjoy watching straight movie stars having a self-indulgent ball playing gay characters. There's no way to watch this movie without seeing Jim Carrey overacting as he always does (except in Eternal Sunshine, when he had a director who kept him on a very short leash and made him act instead of acting up), but this time overacting a gay role instead of a straight role.<br /><br />There's no Steven Russell in this movie, just Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey but getting to say \\"fa9got\\" as much as he wants to. I hate it. I assume it's mainly straight people who like this movie; I can't imagine a gay person enjoying seeing an obnoxious goofball clown play an obnoxious goofball clown with \\"gay\\" written across his forehead. It's insulting and irritating. As a Southerner, I find his phony, erratic Southern accent insulting and irritating too.<br /><br />I wish this overpaid jerk would move back to Canada and raise pigs out in the sticks by himself where he belongs. Ewan McGregor is a little better, because he's Ewan McGregor and not Jim Carrey, but not enough better to make this insulting, self-indulgent star vehicle watchable.

B006BGZJJ4|3.0|My last Kindle cord became brittle and the insulation started falling off.  Same thing happened to my wife's cord.  I ordered this one, not realizing that the cord doesn't come with the power adapter, so then had to order that separately, since I threw out the entire old cord with the adapter still attached.  Perhaps the ad should state up front that the adapter does NOT come with this cord.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|///UPDATE:  price has changed to $9.99.  I still don't understand why it was originally priced at $29.99. But there you have it.  Check prices elsewhere before pulling the trigger on any product here.  Review stands.///<br /><br />I'm at a total loss...because Amazon claims the list price is $29.00, and that their price of $13.22 saves you $15.74<br /><br />But. That's. Just. Wrong.<br /><br />Directly from Apple, this handy adapter is only $9.99, certainly NOT 3 times that like the $29 Amazon claims.<br /><br />Just visit Apple's website. [...] Or search Apple's online store for \\"MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Converter\\" or MD504 or MD504ZM/A<br /><br />This product does work to accomplish what it says it does, and works quite well.  I think it's great for those of us whom already had a MacBook Pro and/or Air, and maybe had bought an extra adapter to keep always in one place that you used the machine most, and then one that stayed in the computer case/bag and ready to travel.<br /><br />My only issue is my disappointment with Amazon, because this \\"List Price\\" that they've drawn through to show how much you \\"save,\\" seems to be totally bogus, and so this naturally makes me wonder if they've have mislead me this way in the past!<br /><br />Ugh.  The situation is both confounding and disappointing.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ok, I admit it. I bought them and read them. I like the subject matter and thought it might be a fun read for a weekend. Sure, there are some titillating parts, but I was so surprised that it was written for what seemed like 8th graders. The writing style and repetition seemed so... juvenile? Lots and lots of British sayings that I've never heard anyone from Seattle and Portland say (they do go to Voodoo doughnuts later in the trilogy, though... someone put EL in the know). And why do they say \\"come\\" instead of \\"come on\\" or \\"come here?\\" I've never taken anyone's hand and said \\"come\\" in my life.<br /><br />The inner goddess thing was so irritating that about halfway through the book, whenever those words appeared, I completely skipped to the next paragraph. That, and that people seemed to constantly be mad at each other... lots of sex scenes, but more often people arguing and being mad. And somehow everyone is making everyone else gasp and whistle through their teeth, or clench their teeth and purse their lips into a hard line... arg. I wish I could make people bat their eyelashes, gasp, whistle, murmur and purse like this.<br /><br />So why did I read all 3? I wanted to give EL her due. To her credit, they are all a very easy read... but the further the story went on, the more boring it got, with more arguing and angry lovers and sappy story that seemed to get worse and worse. If she adds a fourth book, I'll skip it... even it's free from the Kindle Lending Library.

B000L3CHC0|4.0|I needed an everyday watch, but being a watch fanatic, I wasn't going to settle for a non-Swiss brand.  My conditions for a watch were<br />1) Swiss (Swiss quality is swiss quality)<br />2) Could take a beating (sapphire crystal preferred)<br />3) Doesn't break the wallet so if does get dinged up, my heart won't break<br /><br />This watch met all 3 conditions.  It's sapphire, swiss, and most places sell it under $500.  On top of everything, it looks great.  The stainless steel is  high polish so it looks great with a suit, a shirt, and even a t-shirt.  It's fairly light on the hand.<br /><br />The only thing you will want to consider is the warranty.  While the prices on here are way below MSRP, Tissot does not honor warranties if the watch is not bought from their authorized dealer.  Some of the sellers on here offer their own warranty, but I'd make sure and read it in detail. For some, it may be a risk worth taking because, after all, you are paying under $400, not $4000.
B008B7OQHM|5.0|This album is great. Having the Download show on cd is great to have. I cant wait for new music!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is irresponsible to glamorize perversion. The author romanticizes a serious mental illness, and encourages vulnerable young women to put themselves at risk.  I am not a proponent of censorship, but I made sure my daughters know the book is irresponsible and simply trash.  The author's style, incidentally, is sophomoric.
B0086700CM|5.0|I find myself playing this everywhere. weather it is a few minutes during commercial or hour long waits at the dr<br /> its so easy to get off quickly and feel accomplished.
B007SGM084|3.0|Book was hyped up to be great. However, I thought it was okay and could have been cut down from three books to two. The continuous sex became a bore after awhile because it was so unbelievable. If you took out the sex there was a story line, with his sex lifestyle, attempt at his life and the \\"love\\" of his life. How he grew as a man. If those areas would have been involved further I think the books would have been better. Books weren't horrible to read just a lot of sex and could be described as porn for the housewife. Overall more focus on underlying story and books would have received more stars.
B005WKKI96|5.0|I love this CD! A friend had the Zapata se Queda video posted on his Facebook page. I think I've watched it 100 times, it's mesmerizing. You can also see it on her webpage and various other sites. I love to see the whole community, young old, male female, participating in the procession. Now I can listen to the song on my CD. Even though my Spanish is limited, I now know all the words. All the songs on this CD are good in their very different ways. Lila Downs is very versatile musically and vocally. She is a singer who make you feel connected to body and earth.
B0086700CM|3.0|I've played this game on my cousins kindle, but it won't download on my own. it says that its free,  but it needs a credit card in order for you to buy it. I'm kind of lost. someone please explain why for me!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Im not a prude about sexually explicit reading material but there was so much it actually became boring. Also the character development was so pathetic that I didn't really care what happened....
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Joe Bonamassa has several CD's on the market and \\"Driving Towards The Daylight\\" is one of his best! I have been a fan of Joe's for a number of years now and once you listen to his latest CD, you'll be a fan too!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the first book down and wasn't sure if book 2 would be as entertaining. It was! The second book turned out to be my favorite out of the series. Grey was such a fascinating character.
B0074JODP8|5.0|If you know who Joe Bonamassa is, you need to add this DVD to your collection...if you DON'T know who Joe Bonamassa is but love GREAT guitar, you need to add this DVD to your collection. I have a copy of every CD & DVD this guy has put out so far and this is one of the BEST he has done to date. He absolutely shreds every guitar his crew puts in his hands...and there are several! Plus his vocals are REALLY good!<br /><br />BONAMASSA BLAZES at the BEACON!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Nice game. Very fun and easy but challenging as levels progress. Easy to play but requires thinking and planning as difficulty increases.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game .. very addicting I love the complexity of the harder levels it keeps me busy for an hour or two lol
B000001G50|5.0|Beautiful music and very relaxing. Purchased this to help relax and fall asleep at night. Excellent classical pieces and worth every cent.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like this games but it takes time to earn money. It took me a day to earn $40000 without playing it<br /> also it gets old over time.
0307594165|5.0|Like so many of Toni Morrison's novels, Home is heartbreaking and haunting, a story of race and loss and the sometimes bittersweet meaning of home. Frank Money is an African American veteran of the Korean War, attempting to find his way home to Georgia in time to save his dying sister. He travels from town to town, chased by memories of the past and concerns for his safety in racist America.<br /><br />I can't think of another writer who can create characters so real and so compelling that I have tears in my eyes reading about them. Home is yet another masterpiece from one of America's greatest storytellers.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
0060920084|3.0|I love travel books, and this was a fun one. Bryson drives from Iowa to New England, passing through countless small towns, and also such storied American cities as Charleston, New York City, and Plymouth. Then he drives westward nearly to the Pacific Ocean. Bryson's western loop seems more natural wonder-oriented, as he passes through such magnificent places as Death Valley, Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone.<br /><br />Bryson is British, though he has spent much of his life in the US. His wry, stranger-in-a-strange-land observations on encounters in small-town restaurants and attractions will make you laugh. However, at times Bryson doesn't seem to have enjoyed his trip very much, and his blatant relief at coming home to Des Moines echoes Dorothy Gale in saying, \\"There's no place like home.\\" I've crossed Iowa a few times, and my feelings are the near-opposite of Bryson's. There's nothing like finally escaping the cornfields and flatlands of Iowa!
B003Y5HWK4|4.0|I decided to cough up the three dollars it takes to watch the first episode.  I'm not sorry I did.  At first I was disturbed by how the main character, Nucky, was caked with so much make-up, lipstick included, that he looked like a walking corpse, fresh from a funeral parlor.  Once I got used to that, I was hooked.  As a fan of The Sopranos and Breaking Bad, I have come to appreciate made-for-TV, serial productions.  This one won't let you down if you like shows about real terrible folks played by great actors.  I'm three shows into Season One, and it just keeps getting better.  I'm hooked.  Check it out if you liked the two shows I mentioned, above.  I think you'll like this one, as well.
0765357151|4.0|End-of-civilization novels are my guilty pleasure. How do people survive the crash, and how do they cope with the aftermath? Perhaps I hope by reading such books, that I will pick up my own survival tips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I really enjoyed Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend.\\" \\"Omega Man,\\" a 1971 Charlton Heston film, has always been one of my favorite B movies, and I loved the superb \\"I Am Legend\\" starring Will Smith from a couple of years ago. I finally read the book, and while it has a less hopeful ending than the movies (which offered at least a chance of humanity overcoming the plague), it was a very interesting and entertaining read.
B008COPZ60|5.0|Being one of Justin Bieber's biggest fans, this CD definitely did not disappoint me. It varies greatly in different types of music and, what can I say? I love it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Fast connection with very little lag.  Best Remote Desktop I have ever used. Works from my tablet (ICS) and smartphones.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I'll state it simply.  This was an awesome book, and I am glad that I was introduced to David Baldacci.  Any one looking for a very easy, quick and satisfying read should purchase this book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is really fun and pretty cool I like lots of the games and they are pretty easy if you focus on it for a little while
0763650447|5.0|Such a fun book for young children!  Very colorful, cute, short story that your child will memorize before they can read!  This is always on my list to give as a baby shower gift to start the babies library!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I rented the movie for the kids.  It was an easy process and the download was very adequate.  Picture quality was excellent and the best part, it was continuous... no waiting for the download to catch up with the picture playing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The app I am playing keeps on shutting off when I start the game it's no fun so fix it it it was fun at first.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|So many other reviewers have went into detail about the characters and plot of the book so I will not bore you again. I want you to hear how this novel stayed with me for so long and I talked about it so much that my family started to roll their eyes when I would bring it up. I thought I knew some of what had gone on in North Korea. I have seen documentaries etc. This book was so detailed that I felt like I was there. The suffering is something you can't even relate to because it is so far outside a western realm of experience. Loss is something we do know and it is there that the reader can relate. Loss of innocence, faith, possessions, loved ones, basic necessities of life, everything that can be lost taken away or destroyed is done to these people. So why read such a tragic book? It also shows us the resilience of these people, against all odds how they survive. Then they rebuild and they do it for each other. I am humbled at the authors skill and how she weaves all these tales and makes us feel for these courageous people. Do yourself a favour and buy this book.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I did love this app. It did play well on the KINDLE FIRE BUT they have now updated it and since then I haven't been able to keep it steady.  I want so badly to undo the update.  It zooms which is nice for cell phones but the Kindle Fire worked better without the zoom. It won't let me match the tiles easily because it keeps moving. If I zoom it, it works a little better but then I can't see all the tiles. Very frustrating now. I still do like the shading of those tiles that can't be played yet. It has many shapes and a variety of challenges. PLEASE Fix the zoom or change the update back to the way it was. I am downgrading this to a 3 now rather than the 5 I had originally rated it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|would have given a 5 star  but I don't have facebook so hard to get acorns. also have had to purchase coins which was a bummer.
0345803485|1.0|Sad to see this book in the grocery stores for young teens to be able to read.  Young girls are being taught by example that abuse is okay. Some say it is only fantasy and a poorly written one at that. But what is next?  What else will we allow our children to be exposed to. Twisted idea of love. Only a twisted mind would enjoy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|cool game kills time. reminds me of Sim city but diff. don't like how top menu blocks ur buildings though
1466401885|5.0|Well, I am not exactly a YA, but I enjoyed this book very much.  So much that I think it is deserves 4.5 stars.  A love story, is a love story, and I remember being very much in love at the same age as the H/h.<br /><br />When I first read some of the reviews, I thought there would be a lot of graphic sex, crude language, and so on, but I found the sex scenes to be pretty tame and the language definitely tamer than 50 Shades.  I hate boxing, and the fight scenes were more graphic than the sex scenes.<br /><br />Would I want my teenager daughter to read this book?  Well, she is not old enough yet, but if she was 16, I would prefer she read this book than watch MTV.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book from netgalley.com
0307744434|1.0|After all the glowing reviews I was prepared to love this book, but I was a sorely mistaken.  The book was a gift and I therefore felt I had to finish it. The descriptions of scenes and clothing were amazing, but the story line was so confusing half the time I didn't know where the characters were, what time period they were in, or who was controlling who. I doubt I will ever read another book by this author.
0345803485|1.0|...the repetition...the eighth grade writing style...the repetition...the repetition...after 50 pages, can't...take...it...anymore...<br />Sound of hammer drawn back.<br />Sound of gunshot.<br />Sound of reviewer's body slumping to the floor.<br />The reviewer's face has a smile.<br />Why?<br />Because now the reviewer won't have to finish Fifty Shades of Grey!
034580404X|5.0|I was very pleased with the books coming in the Trilogy pack.  Its easy to keep them all together.  The books themselves were fantastic.  I read all 3 of them in less than 2 weeks, I had hard time putting them down.  I would highly reccommend any mature adult to read them, men and women.  They put your mind into a completely different world and your imagination and creativity into high gear.  I hope all of you enjoy them as much as I did. I certainly hope there are more to come from this author. Thank you E.L. James
B000VSYDRM|5.0|This movie is outstanding for many reasons:<br /><br />It is a visually beautiful movie with top notch acting performances, appropriate pacing, a seductively dark and original plot with a climax/ending that leaves all of the fantastic olfactory notes of the movie to develop in the viewer at their own pace.<br /><br />A more detailed report below<br /><br />1. Outstanding cinematography: There shouldn't be any debate on this; the movie is gorgeous.<br /><br />2. The acting is superb: Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman are, as expected, excellent and Ben Winshaw portrays a very convincing sociopath.  Laura's actress disappoints slightly, but Laura does not contribute much to the actual plot other than her existence so i found the acting to be easily overlooked.<br /><br />3. Brilliantly Paced: The movie is as methodically paced as its main character, creating an appropriate and comfortable tempo.<br /><br />4. Dark dark dark dark dark: I understand that the chilling and disturbing is not for some people and that is ok, you most likely won't enjoy this movie then. But if you are like me and are captivated by psychosis and the investigation of evil (i.e. Silence of the Lambs, The Shining) then this movie is certainly for you.<br /><br />5. Original concept: Nothing more to really comment on that front... watch the movie.<br /><br />6. The end: (no spoilers) many people claim it to be unsatisfying but , personally, the movie couldn't have ended in a better way. The main character, in his mind, was at the end of his story. So the movie ends. The ending doesn't have to be believable or realistic because the movie is FANTASY. If one complains that this movie is unrealistic and therefore somewhat unenjoyable, then they might as well say the same thing about any superhero movie/story.<br /><br />6 1/2. AGAIN... the movie is FANTASY. Do not pay any mind to other reviewers criticizing Perfume for being unbelievable and unrealistic because that is simply not how it is presented. Ofcourse no one could have the sense of smell that Grenouille does... accept that aspect as a given of the story's universe if for no other reason than because the level of realism in the movie is largely irrelevant to its plot, characters, and presentation.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have the G35 wired; bummer.  Turns out they break A LOT, and mine did, also after about 6 months.  Waiting on warranty.<br /><br />Got the G930.  Wow!  Better sound, I think.  Louder.  Clear with no distortion.<br /><br />Only BUMMER is that audio properties don't allow BALANCE in the Levels tab.  That is a big one for me, as I'm hard of hearing on my left side.  Consequently, the sound is imbalanced for me, which means when someone is sneaking up on my left side in DayZ, I don't hear them and I die.  WTF are they thinking - not offering balance in a 7.1 headset???????<br /><br />Battery life is good (8 hours) and the ability to charge while wearing them is fantastic.<br /><br />I've only had them a week, but - so far so good (except for balance).<br /><br />Now - if they only offered the ability to plug in an RCA plug to the USB base, that would be fantastic.
B0086DBE62|1.0|Simply put, I think this movie was a mess with a ridiculous convoluted plot....nothing like a Snow White story.  They obviously depended on Julia Roberts star power to raise it above mediocre.  They failed!!
030758836X|3.0|This book hooked me from page 1. I couldn't put it down for two days. I was recommending it to friends and family. Then I read the last page and could not believe it ended the way it did.
0345803485|1.0|I've read reviews on this book and it was brought up recently at a local munch as the new gateway to bdsm that is drawing in more and more people.  This completely saddens me.  I skimmed the pages available on amazon as I was not about to pay for this trash.  Please, please I implore those curious about bdsm, whether it just be in the privacy of your own mind, read something better!  The Shadowlands series by Cherise Sinclair are decent, as are the ever popular Beauty Trilogy by Anne Rice's pen name.  The writing for this piece of drivel is just terrible, even skimming it!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Lots of fun.  Can't put it down. I Love it. Will recommend to all my friends with Kindles. Thanks a lot.
B004SEUIWO|5.0|I have always really liked this movie but having it be for so cheap was just the icing on the cake
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|this is a good game but missing the mighty eagle so I give this game 3 stars maybe 5 stars If it has the mighty eagle
1419703692|5.0|So often you pre-order something like this, months in advance, and when it arrives it is a disappointment. Not so here. This is truly a beautiful book packed with stunning photos and behind the scenes info from all three movies in the Dark Knight Trilogy! I am exceptionaly happy with this and strongly recommend.<br />Even friends who have no interest in movie making have been picking it up off the coffee table and freaking out over it.<br />Awesome.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|The levels are short but great game. Its kid friendly , reminds me of mario.  dont really like time time clock but its still great : )
B002GHIPYI|4.0|For $35 these headphones are simply awesome.  As some people have already mentioned the highs can be on the outrageous side, but with an equalizer you can bring them down and fine tune them to your taste.  Everything sounds so bright, punchy, and clear.  Just keep in mind that these are $35 and not $100+ ones.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I just finished the book a few minutes ago and there's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said by many other reviewers, except: BUY THIS BOOK - or, at the very least, get on that free Kindle sample/Look Inside! feature.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure that the reason you are reading these reviews is because you're thinking: \\"Okaay... a 630 page book for $2.99 with 205 five stars.  This guy must have a big family.\\"  Well, I can't really say much in regards to that last portion, but.. No.  These ratings are very well deserved.<br /><br />For the mere price of a snack, you get: a top-notch story with excellent pacing and fully fleshed out characters.  There is a sequel for the book in the works, however, that doesn't mean that the questions and conflicts brought up within the storyline are left unresolved.  You will definitely get a sense of closure.<br /><br />There were, however, a few things that bothered me...<br /><br />The first being the size of the font.  It is ridiculously small and I had to bump up my Kindle font nearly to maximum size in order to read it.  Although it's not a huge deal, it did get quite annoying whenever I decided to switch books for a bit.<br /><br />The second is the editing.  A lot of people have already mentioned this, but it is a nuisance.  I found myself having to re-read some sentences a couple of times before I understood what was being said.<br /><br />Aaand... lastly, a bit of confusion in regards to transition.  During certain parts of the book, particularly the end, the text shifts from one period of time to another.  I'm not referring to the sections with Verniers, but within the actual chapters.  One specific portion is when Sherin asks Vaelin to explain his plan to her, and he says: \\"I don't see why not.\\"  The next paragraph is a flashback... but it's not really apparent until you continue reading in a bit, get a little confused, and realize that it's a different time period.  I don't know if this was an issue for anyone else, but it was something that bothered me due to the numerous flashbacks near the end of the novel.<br /><br />Another related gripe is that Ryan was not very clear that what we actually read in the chapters is not what Vaelin is telling Verniers.  There were more than a few moments when Verniers would ask something that was made explicitly clear a chapter or two back.  So.. which parts did Vaelin actually tell Verniers?  Who knows and.. really, who cares, since it's not meaningful but it got annoying that he kept asking redundant (from the reader's perspective) questions.<br /><br />In the end, those are all just MINOR issues that shouldn't deter you from this title.  This is a truly immersive novel and worth more than the price that it is listed for.  The Raven's Shadow is definitely a recommendation-worthy book and one of the best stories I have read in this genre.  I am so disappointed to have reached the end of the book and eagerly await the next installment.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game very fun entertaining a a a a Antananarivo. a a a a a a a a a a a
B007R6X9IK|5.0|Had to toss this in there after seeing the 2-star rating also listed today...gah! It's incredible to hear what Dave sounds like with a more orchestral sound behind him - it's flat out beautiful. Nothing against Depeche Mode because I love them too, but Soulsavers arrangements are sprawling and epic, while his melancholy lyrics and expansive voice are perfect for this pairing. I think if you're fans of \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion,\\" you really enjoy this...lots of guitar, gospel singers, and his gritty vocals. The Soulsavers tracks (La Ribera and Point Sur Pt. 1) are exquisitely done and it takes a big voice like Dave's to not get lost when the music kicks in. Don't expect any real rockers here, but perfect for a lazy day or a good road trip! This has been on rotation with his solo albums, and fits in wonderfully with his catalog.<br /><br />Favorite Songs: Just Try, Take Me Back Home, I Can't Stay, In the Morning, Presence of God
B007SGM084|4.0|Review from Allodoxophobia [...]    For those of you who have been living on a remote island for the past few months and know nothing about the series, FSG is about the very sexy and mysterious billionaire (and BDSM fanatic) Christian Grey and the object of his lust the young and naive Anastasia Steele.  EL James originally published the book on a \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction site so for Christian and Ana just picture a much darker and more \\"adult\\" Edward and Bella.  The majority of the story takes place in Seattle, although when we first meet Ana she is finishing up her last year of college in Vancouver, WA.  Fast forward a bit and Ana has met the disarmingly attractive Christian and is instantly consumed by thoughts of him.  He pursues her and opens her eyes to a world she never knew existed...BDSM.  Ana enters into a relationship with Christian hoping to be more to him than just some submissive play thing, and she gets her wish...although not without some heartbreak and pain.  The couple has their ups and downs but never fear, all ends well for the couple by the end of the third book.    Now, lets gets down to the good stuff.  I found myself jaw on the floor and cheeks red while reading many parts of this book.  Christian is without a doubt the kind of man who can make a woman blush.  Having never read an erotic novel before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Well, oh my...I felt like I should be sitting in a dark closet with my iPad somewhere just so no one could see what I was reading.  On a hotness scale of 1-5, 5 being set me on fire FSG scored a 6 :)  So, if you are looking for a book/books that will get you all hot and bothered, then FSG should be at the top of your list.  But if you are looking for a book with good writing, character development and a realistic plot- you might want to look elsewhere.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed reading the FSG trilogy, the writing isn't going to win any awards.  But that is fine by me, let's be honest I didn't read the books fortheir literary value :)
0061733199|5.0|This is one of those books that you hope you'll never need, but if the occasion arose... I believe that this is the book to have.  The title says it all... any climate, any situation.  This book is full of information that the average, everyday person would never know... but in a bad situation might need to.  If you buy, I hope you are as happy with it as I was and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its good if you like games where you have to be good at a lot of things to be good at the game in general.

B001Q7JD5O|5.0|I think this is a great movie although i think it does have some flaws.<br />It starts off a bit slow and them being on the island was a bit shorter than i wanted them to be. but all in all i like it
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was too strange and convoluted for me. It did not hold my interest. I generally love mysteries but not this one. Apparently I am in the minority though.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This was an excellent app...at least til I just went to open my purchased book & it is no longer on my computer...
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun. At first I thought it was complicated but when my friend showed me it seemed glfun. Its so additive.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|Take two talented and attractive actors, make them dull and ugly, and here's the result. Nothing's funny. Nothing's dramatic. The dialogue is mundane, and the only memorable scene doesn't fit. A much, much better Anne Hathaway movie is \\"Love and Other Drugs,\\" and no, it's not about narcotics. See that one. Skip this one.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|this is an awesome game!!  graphics are good and I look at it as playing an adventure game kinds like Mario!!  so far I have nothing bad to say about this game and hope I never to lol. definitely worth the 99 cents...I like it so much that I would have paid more BUT don't get me wrong I'm glad it was just 99 cents!!  lol

0425263908|5.0|This book was very interesting. If you liked fifty shades of gray you will like this one. I have ordered the second book. It comes in Oct, that drives me crazy
034580404X|5.0|I would recommend this 3 book trilogy set to anyone who is looking for a hot, steamy and intense read!!  This was the perfect way to order the Grey series...as soon as I was done with one, I moved right on the next!  I finished the three books in one week!
0345803507|5.0|I have read all of these books. I keep hearing they are sex books. They are not, they are a love story. You have to read the second book to really understand it. A lot of sex in the book espicaaly in the first one. When you get to number three it all comes  to gether. I am going to reread them. Series not complete without number three.
0240815807|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough--I've read quite a few books on mixing and this beats them all. The depth, detail and delivery is all there. I just started reading it again to comb through anything I sped past on the first read! Mike Senior really helped to put a lot of things in perspective--a great writer and extremely generous with his information.<br /><br />-JE
B007IXWKUK|4.0|very good book.  I was not going to purchase any after the first but after finishing the first I had to have the second.  Not so sure about the 3rd.
B008BIZ06M|4.0|I own every Offspring CD they have ever recorded & have been a fan for most of their career. I mention this as it gives some perspective to this review. The only reason I gave 4 & not 5 stars is that this is not my favorite Offspring CD. Like wine, beer, & art - it's all a matter of personal preferences. My favorite song by far on this CD is Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing - ranks up there with most of the classic Offspring. The song rocks & has a message, which has always been The Offspring's secret weapon. Makes you bang your head & want to listen to the lyrics as they have something to say. It's human nature to compare an artist's current work against earlier recordings & I'm no different. If you're a long time fan like me, it's a must have. If you're listening to The Offspring for the first time, I would suggest purchasing almost any of the earlier CD's to get a true dose of how The Offspring delivers a punch.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Really good movie and totally worth paying extra to see it Blu ray. They made it everything look really good. It brought back many memories! I am glad i bought it.
030758836X|2.0|Seriously THE most ridiculous ending ever...EVER!!!  I enjoyed it until the end.  I feel like the author just gave up!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The author warns you in the description of this book that it is for mature audiences. If that's not enough, simply read the reviews. Regardless of the review rating, they all explain that there is explicit content.<br /><br />Now that that has been said.... It is quite obvious that most people lack the maturity needed to read this novel. Yes, there is sex & BDSM, but that is not the only part of this book. There is a plot, a story behind the explicit scenes, but those scenes add to the story. Without them, it would be a dull and very short story. Some of them I read, some of them I skim over. The unfolding of the underlying plot is utterly amazing. It entraps you, intrigues you.<br /><br />If you are going to dwell on the sex & BDSM, then don't read this book (unless you are into that, then be sure to skim the \\"boring\\" parts). You will know by the time you are half way through if you want to continue reading the trilogy. I am so glad I didn't let the negative comments and reviews steer me away from this book, or the trilogy. It is a fantastic story, and E L James is a great author. I can't wait to see what her next novel is going to be.
0811879542|5.0|I find it sad that other reviewers were disappointed in this book.  I am incredibly picky, and overly critical of all things geared toward children.  After taking various reviews into account, I took a chance on this book and am thrilled with the outcome.  Fantastic addition to our collection!  Refreshingly clean and simple, herein lies the brilliance.  Order away and enjoy this clever, quality book.

B003XE3G0Q|5.0|These crocs are almost like the actual Mary Jane crocs. They are comfortable and I like that the back sling doesn't move.
B007BZM30M|5.0|I like music a lot. I have two ears, which means I should talk twice as much as a listen. There is nothing better than pop music today. Everyone plays instruments and writes really deep songs about things like being in clubs. As much as everything by Kesha, the Biebs and everything featuring Ne-yo are awesome, this song just takes all of that and makes a pot of stew. I'm not really that smart, but from the lyrics I gather that she has missed this boy she just met her whole life. She keeps saying over and over for him to call her and then throws a maybe after that. Talk about a curveball as good as anything Dwight Gooden ever threw. I would get all excited if a girl told me to call her, but if she said maybe after it I wouldn't know what to do. That is really confusing. I went ahead and had all of my neighbors over for a discussion of this song where we made vienna sausages sprinkled with pixie stick stuff. None of us had any idea if she really wants the guy to call her or not. She did mention ripped jeans a couple times which plays right into my wheelhouse. I love cutting off my jeans into shorts, but make sure they are short enough that the pockets show out the back. That is how you look totally hot and get girls like Carly to maybe want you to call them. I'd probably err on the side of calling her if I didn't know for sure because if you don't call, you are never going to get to go rollerskating with her. My parents would probably be able to drop us off and pick us up at the roller rink, which would only help my chances.<br /><br />This song is just really hard for me to figure out, but that, along with the fact that it is certified by the Biebs, make it something that should be in your collection. Don't come try to take mine though because my dog stays in front of my favorite cds so no one takes them again like two years ago.
0307276902|5.0|Once you get used to reading Frey's syntax and style you'll begin to enjoy this great book (easy read). Chronicling the recovery of a hardcore drug and alcohol addict this story immerses the reader in a highly vivid illustrated world of agony and pain, sorrow and grief full of gruesome scenes of the horrors one would face in the process of recovering.<br /><br />Warning: Not for the faint of heart and those delicate to explicit language

B000MX7V5M|5.0|My preference is for Hitchcock's grittier suspense movies, but &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; has so many things going for it, I can't give it less than 5 stars!<br /><br />It's the early 50's and in an introduction, we see the arms only of a black-gloved thief stealing jewelry. Then to a French Villa, where the housekeeper sees a newspaper heading: &quot;The Cat Prowls Again?&quot; The column continues, &quot;Is it true, or just a rumor - that John Robie, former cat burglar of Paris before the war, is once again on the prowl? Fashionable resorts on the Riviera are being regularly looted by a skillful jewel thief. Robie, once a hero of the French Resistance Army, was said to have reformed - however, the style of this new crime wave is certainly his.&quot;<br /><br />Robie, in his French sailor-like striped sweater with rakish red &amp; white scarf, is not amused when the police arrive in force to &quot;talk&quot; to him. He escapes (cleverly) and goes to the restaurant of another reformed thief/Resistance fighter, Bertani. Robie tells him that he is not behind the new robberies, but no body believes him: &quot;What I can't understand is how this thief can imitate me so perfectly. It has to be someone who knew every detail of my technique.... I've got to catch this imitator myself.&quot;<br /><br />And that's what he does, aided by Mr. H.H. Hughson, an insurance agent who is very nervous indeed. Hughson manages an introduction to a likely future burglary victim, the redoubtable Mrs. Stevens and her cool calm and exceedingly beautiful daughter, Frances.<br /><br />There are so many fabulous scenes between Grace Kelly and Cary Grant that it needs a book to describe them. And Grant has his humor on in several more scenes, such as when he's trying to escape through a flower market and a diminutive gray-haired flower seller stops him.<br /><br />These are the extras on the one-disc DVD &quot;Special Collector's Edition&quot;:<br /><br />1. Commentary by Peter Bogdanovich and Laurent Bouzereau. Bogdanovich knew both Hitchcock and Grant, and Bouzereau co-wrote a book about Hitchcock with the director's daughter, Pat Hitchcock. &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; was filmed right after the very successful &quot;Rear Window&quot;, and Bogdanovich said that the later movie has more of a vacation quality to it; Hitchcock could be more relaxed. In his own words, Hitchcock could rely on the charm of two leading actors &quot;who were beyond charming&quot;.<br /><br />Grant was 50 years old when he filmed &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, and he looks great. Bogdanovich and Bouzereau agree that he was in great shape, even though he never exercised. Or, rather, Bogdanovich tells us, Grant once told him that &quot;he never exercised, he just made love.&quot;<br /><br />Grace Kelly fell in love with Prince Rainier right after &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, so it's her last movie.<br /><br />2. &quot;Writing and Casting 'To Catch a Thief' &quot; a 2002 short with commentary by Pat Hitchcock (his daughter), Mary Stone (Hitchcock's granddaughter) and Steven deRosa (author, &quot;Writing with Hitchcock&quot;), accompanied by movie shots and stills as well as personal movies and photos.  One of the things they touch on is how Hitchcock got the innuendo-laden dialogue and shots between Grant and Kelley past the PCA (Production Code Association).<br /><br />3. &quot;The Making of 'To Catch a Thief' &quot;. The extras # 2, 3 and 4 were pretty much all filmed together, and then they divided them into three extras. Nothing wrong with it, but they could have put it into one long featurette.  Commentators in this short are Mary Stone, Doc Erickson (production manager), Steven deRosa, Pat Hitchcock and Sylvette Baudrot (continuity in France). Baudrot remembers that Grant showed up for filming the beginning in a dress shirt with buttonholes on the collar. The film was supposed to take place right after the war, in '48-'49, and Baudrot told Hitchcock that the shirt-style was more modern and American, at that. And that's why John Robie is wearing a sweater with a scarf tied around his neck!<br /><br />I also got a kick out of one of Mary Stone's reminisces. Her grandfather liked happy endings, she says, but he liked to have a last little twist at the end. In this case, the very last scene has Grant and Kelly embracing on his villa's porch and Kelly murmers, &quot;So this is where you live. Oh, Mother will love it up here.&quot;!!<br /><br />4. &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and 'To Catch a Thief': An Appreciation &quot; The same people as #2 &amp; 3. Still interesting tidbits, just not sure why they divided it up like this.<br /><br />5. &quot;Edith Head - The Paramount Years&quot;.  This documentary was filmed in 2002 and has also been an extra on a DVD release of &quot;Sunset Blvd.&quot;. I hadn't seen this documentary before, however, and I really enjoyed it. Head's career spanned 60 years, 40 of them with Paramount. Commentors include David Chierichetti (Edith Head biographer), Tzetzi Ganev (head of Custom-Made Dept for Western Costume at Paramount), Bob Mackie (fashion designer) and Rosemary Clooney (actor, who knew Head from the movie &quot;White Christmas&quot;).<br /><br />Head got her first big break when the lead costume designer didn't get along with mega-star Clara Bow. He gave Bow's assignments to Head, who learned a big lesson from that which she carried throughout her whole career: Get along with everybody.<br /><br />Head had told people that Hitchcock was her favorite director, and &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; was &quot;her all time favorite film&quot;.<br /><br />6. Trailer<br /><br />Lovely movie. I watch it for the humor - which can be tongue-in-cheek. Such as when Robie escapes by boarding a bus and ends up in the back seat. Between a woman with a bird in a cage and ... Alfred Hitchcock!<br /><br />Happy Readers more modern and American, at that. And that's why John Robie is wearing a sweater with a scarf tied around his neck!<br /><br />I also got a kick out of one of Mary Stone's reminisces.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Abby is a student at Eastern University. She's left her life behind in Kansas, and taken her friend America along with her. She's hoping to escape who she was, hoping to never be remembered for the life she's leaving behind. America has promised to be her conscience, and together at Eastern, they have each other's backs.<br /><br />One night, while attending an inner Circle fight, Abby comes face to face with everything she's trying to leave behind. Travis Maddox is the playboy of Eastern University, but for Abby, whom he calls Pigeon, he's willing to leave his playboy life behind. But Abby is resistant to his charms. They have both met their match and whether together or apart, they are a disaster waiting to happen.<br /><br />My Review<br /><br />*My goal with this review is to not give any spoilers! You just have to read this book for yourself!!<br /><br />It's completely a cliche, but....I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!! There are so many things that I loved about this book, I just am not sure where to start....so I'll just dive right in!<br />The first thing I LOVED about this book was Abby. Innocent, independent, beautiful, fun loving Abby. I loved this character from the beginning! She's moved to Eastern to escape a father who blames her for his downturn in life, and a mother who can't stay away from the bottle. Ready to start a life that's no where near what she left, she walks right into that same life when she comes face to face with bad boy Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox. She's completely resistant to his charms and has no intentions of being the next girl that he doesn't call back.<br />The next first thing I LOVED about this book is Travis. You just can't love Abby without also loving Travis. Travis is the buzz cut, tattooed, muscled-up playboy of Eastern University. There's practically a different girl every night on his \\"couch.\\" Travis isn't just rough and tough, never losing a fight in the \\"Circle\\" at Eastern, but he's also a frat brother, the man about campus, and a brainiac. When he comes face to face with innocent, cardigan wearing Abby at one of his fights, he has met his match. Abby isn't the only one trying to escape a past. Travis was raised by his dad and four older brothers, with little memory of his mother, who passed away when he was very young. Travis has built a wall, and Abby may be just the only person who will ever be allowed to knock it down.<br />The next first thing I LOVED about this book is Abby and Travis's story. Which is the entire book!! What a roller-coaster ride!<br />Some may think that Abby's weak and stupid, or even cruel and heartless, but at the age of 19, she's lived a life that most never do! It's a life she never wants to be known for, or to ever live again. That's the problem with Travis. He is a walking memory of everything that she's left behind. But it's more than that. Abby doesn't want to ever be blamed for being the person behind someone's downfall ever again.<br />Some may think that Travis is an arrogant bully who can't keep his pants on. Which is pretty accurate. But that all changes with Abby. There isn't much Travis wouldn't do for Abby, which is his downfall. But when Travis let's that wall down, it's a forever event. This is the Travis that I love most. I love the Travis that will lay his life down for his girl, even when she isn't his girl. I love the Travis that melts at her feet, and I love the Travis that he is with her. I don't love the Travis the comes out during the rough times.<br />What I loved most about Beautiful Disaster is everything!<br />This book isn't for the faint of heart. It's got a lot of language, sex, fighting, blood and gore. But it's got a heart and soul. This story breathes it's own life. It is a Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />FTC required disclaimer: I received this book from the publisher. I did not receive monetary compensation for this review.
B0006MT314|5.0|Great CD!  I love that they put \\"When the Stars go Blue\\" by Tyler and Bethany on this CD!  I've heard other versions of that song, but really love their version!!  It was basically the reason I bought the CD, but have come to enjoy listening the whole CD!  \\"Glad\\" by Tyler Hilton is probably my second favorite song.  I've become a fan of his since the show.  \\"Sidewalks\\" by Story of the Year is also a memorable song from the show, as is \\"Everybody's Changing\\" by Keane and \\"Mixed Tape\\" by Butch Walker.  If you don't recognize them by name, you will when you hear them.  I highly recommend this CD to any fan or anybody that enjoys a great mix of music!!
0385751532|5.0|Whenever a holocaust story arises, there is the expectation of the familiar (to some) stories and inscrutable evidence.  Boone allows himself the freedom to imagine the perspective of a child who has a front-row seat outside the gates of Out-With (Auschwitz), and creates a perfect foil in that child's newfound \\"friend for life\\" who lives inside the massive compound.  This is fiction based on reality but told as a \\"fable\\" (something meant to enhance wisdom and learning), but is so far from didactic.  Initially, I felt this book would be pleasantly enlightening but not anything new or groundbreaking.  Yet it is groundbreaking.  Having already seen the film, I felt there would be no surprises.  I felt shock as I read the last pages.  Tears.  There was not enough information to conclude the story.  Losses were not only tragic but cut-off into the great realm of  the unknowing...and the knowing stares one right in the face overall.<br /><br />The narration gives far more than can be presented on the screen.  The all too valid interpretation a child has on life, even its very worst impure realities is spoken--creating a true meeting of the minds between author and reader.  What more is there to say than that a child's purity is never to be taken for granted?
B007ELN8Y8|1.0|Why bother when you can watch great B/W on Turner Classic Movies. My friend is a member of the Academy and voted it for Best Picture. This is just a matter of taste. I just kept thinking, \\"Are you kidding?\\".

0312360266|5.0|Ok.......so i hav read all the books in the series and this one is not my favorite....<br /><br />I do like it though i am re-reading it for the 2nd time and it still draws my attention in like a moth to a light.....although compared to the later books that have the raven mockers and Kalona.....its boring.  But trust me it is well worth the read! Zoey is a cliche troubled 16 yr old and this is a vampire book but it is NOTHING like twilight!!! Whicg i hate (i know what ur thinking...what teenager doesnt like twilight!!!?!?...apparently me) there r no sparkling pale  vampire guys who drink blood....or where wolves....but instead there r evil angels who want to take over the world and destroy humans!! And zoey and her friends, even Aphrodite, have to save the world!! But that all happens later i  the series.....but without this book none of the action could have happened.......i am dying to read hidden (the 10th book) it comes out just before my birthay and its driving me crazy not having it in i my grasp... p.c and her daughter kirsten hav done a magnificent job and i applaud them for getting me and my friends addicted to yet another book series!! I L<3VE these books it is a MUST READ series...... ill stop giving stuff away so u can find out for urself.....if u dont like this book im sorry but its great and even if u dont i still suggest reading the rest of the series because it does get better!!!! I can promise epic battles and blood and bulls and fighting and killing and action and funniness and AWESOME SAUCE ( youll get that joke when u get to Destined the 9th book) but bye bye hope u buy this book!
B0089AF2DS|1.0|As a huge fan of Baroness first 4 releases, this album was a huge disappointment. Baroness seemed to move away from everything that made this band enjoyable (great driving rifts, ethereal nonsensical lyrics, great song writing) to a whiny pop-rock clone.<br /><br />If you're looking for a follow up to the red and blue album, don't bother with this. You'll be wasting your money. If you're looking for another meh band who complains  a lot in their lyrics you're in luck!

BTW using Samsung Galaxy S2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 app works great on both.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|do not get this app messes up your restaurants and always asks you to spend money do not get this app.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a total piece of rubbish from beginning to page 150 - where I finally stopped torturing myself. If you like poorly written, repetitive, excruciatingly slow stories about nothing in particular, mixed with a lot of sex in which Ana sounds like a pirate (she actually says \\"Aargghh!\\" every time they do it), then by all means, pick up this book. Otherwise, don't even bother. I wish I could give this \\"book\\" zero stars because it really is that awful.<br /><br />For me, there is not one redeeming quality to it. Both characters are one dimensional, even though she tries to get us to believe Christian is sooooo deep. He has issues with food, issues with women, issues, issues, issues. This book is nothing more than 500 pages of drivel about how badly a man can treat a woman, and how long she will stay with him through it all. It has nothing to do with real BDSM relationships (not that I know much about that, but from what people are saying this \\"book\\" is a very poor representation). It is an extremely dangerous thing to send this kind of message to women. This man is sick. He is not about love, he is about pain. He is not about mutual pleasure, he is about HIS pleasure. Don't we have enough of that in this world already?<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: I have read a lot of websites that have reviewed this book and laughed out loud at their interpretation of it (they hated it too)! Toward the end of the book there is a scene where he literally plucks a tampon from her hoo-ha. That is not sexy, no matter what scenario it happens in.<br /><br />I can't believe this is a best seller! More importantly I can't believe all the woman out there drooling over this man and saying that's how a woman should be treated! I have actually had women say that to me. It's sad.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how awful this is, but if you really want to read it, what difference does it make what I think? If you do pick it up, don't say I didn't warn you!

B000UU4NE4|1.0|How could anyone actually give this five stars? This is baffling to me. This could of been a good movie, and I still am unsure as to why they made this into a musical. But this is the reason why Spider-man was remade, and is now even more doodoo than ever. Please stop supporting doodoo movies.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Why had I not I read the reviews posted on Amazon, I would never have been swayed by the hype that was put out about this book.<br /><br />A few pages in I felt I had been hoodwinked as for the playroom, one visit was enough, so boring wasnt even exotic, playboy magazine is streets ahead if thats what you need to read to get a thrill,  she bites her lip so many times its a wonder she has a lip left,he is a poor excuse for a man, I could go on but please do not be swayed by the publicity on this book its not worth 1/10th of the money I paid and if I could get a refund I would, def not a book to recommend to anyone, writing is appalling, storyline pathetic  and as for the sex the author would want to get out more often and have a  life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game starts off easy and becomes more challenging as you go along.kid friendly and a great time waster. family fun game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love it!!! It's a really great game. If you like &quot;Where's my water?&quot; you will love this game. It's great for puzzle lover's.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Before there was Evil Dead and Army of Darkness. Now there is SHAUN OF THE DEAD. This film is amazing. Hilarious and still makes you jump at times. Simon Pegg has knocked on out of the ball park. This film magically combines comedy and horror. Wish we could see a trilogy from this film alone. However HOT FUZZ is amazing too !

031620157X|5.0|A must read for lovers of fairytales! Great for the younger audience as well as the young at heart! I am 21 years old and absolutely love it and recommend it to everyone. I can't wait for more books from Chris Colfer
B008ASLK8A|4.0|When the first came out I refused to watch it, because my inner Anglophile revolted at the thought of Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes. Such abominable casting was a tragedy of positively Hellenistic proportions to a true Holmes aficionado.<br />That said, my husband rented Game of Shadows last week and I was watching it before I realized what it was. To my astonishment, I found myself sucked in and thoroughly enjoying the experience. The only thing that bothered me (spoiler) was the incredibly trite \\"super villain amassing super weapons in order to start a war for profit\\" plotline. That part was boringly predictable and quite a letdown after the way it had been building up to that point. The sudden shift to comic book style villain was jarring and disappointing.<br />All in all, it was still a dramatically visceral take on Holmes and his world enjoyable enough to make me watch it twice and then rent the first installment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it is so fun and cool to play. Cool for yong kids and older kids.
030746363X|5.0|I'm still working on the implementation of the diet plan in this book (Slow Carb Diet), but to say this is a \\"diet\\" book alone would be totally inaccurate. There are some VERY good tips and helpful advice on everything from sex and fertility (and not just fairytale, late night television crap about increasing the size of your manhood) to outrageous sleeping pattern changes.  Can you imagine what life would be like only sleeping a total of 1-2 hours a day? If you are thinking that is impossible, just read the book and see HOW WRONG your many assumptions about health and life really are. Even if you don't implement a single item in this book, it is quite an fascinating read. But if you pay close attention and actually try to follow the advice of the author, you may find your life changed forever simply in the ATTEMPT.

B000IZXR7U|3.0|So let me set the record straight about this version of the movie from Amazon's Instant Video. It is the original Aussie soundtrack, not an English dubbed version. Between all the different DVDs and downloads, if you are interested in downloading this one, be assured that it is not dubbed. It is however, pan and scan. What that means for those of you who have never watched movies on VHS tape is that the screen is formatted for a squarish cathode ray television with a 4:3 aspect ratio, instead of the standard 16:9 ratio for widescreen HDTVs. So when you watch this, you're going to get the black bars on both sides of the screen. Yes, at first it is \\"widescreen\\" for a few seconds, but then it changes for the rest of the movie. In my opinion, this doesn't hurt the presentation.<br /><br />The movie itself is a victim of the storytelling of the late 70s and obvious budgetary constraints. That's not to say that this is a bad film, but it doesn't really hold up today, even against your typical B-movie actioner. Some of the acting is way over the top to the point of being ridiculous. I'm thinking of the barechested police chief in the black leather pants and black silk scarf smoking a cigar and watering his plants and yelling at Max down the stairs while still holding his orange watering can. But I guess in Australia in the  late 70s, this was pretty normal. I will say that the climax of the movie shows admirable restraint and I thought it was well-executed. The real draws here are Mel Gibson and the fact that this is the movie that sets the stage for The Road Warrior. That the Road Warrior came out of this movie is amazing. The quality of filmmaking rose proportional to the budget and what comes out of it is nothing less than a masterpiece. This movie, at the very least, has really awesome box art.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This mystery was presented in a unique way that kept me hungry for more.  The back and forth presentation between today's events and the diary from the past created a delicious tension.  This is one of those books that I was sorry had ended and I'm hoping there is a sequel
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Once you get that first hit of \\"Br Ba\\"  you will buy seasons 2-4 as well. Do not purchase unless you are able to buy the rest of the series within a week or two!
B001UV4XWY|4.0|*** Minor spoilers ***<br /><br />The plot itself is interesting,  a couple who are stretched for funds are offered a million dollars to press a button, and someone will die. They press it and then .... This first part. I have seen before in a twilight zone episode but what this movie does is continue this plot. Overall, I think the plot will keep you interested throughout. To me, it is a moral point at the end. A person has been killed, and his death should not go unpunished.<br /><br />The production itself is fairly cheap. There are no brilliant action scenes, the filming will not particularly impress you.<br /><br />Overall, I suggest you go watch it.
B008EEWN6I|4.0|I absolutely LOVED 'Elect the Dead' & 'Elect the Dead Symphony'. I wasn't feeling 'Imperfect Harmonies'. That being said, I'm happy to say that 'Harakiri' is a welcome return to form for Serj Tankian. The music is heavier that 'Imperfect Harmonies', and a bit closer to 'Elect the Dead', or even some System, while still managing to sound unique in its own right.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you like Serj, buy it. If you like System, buy it. Not as good as 'Elect the Dead', in my opinion; but far better than 'Imperfect Harmonies'.
0062060562|1.0|Not what I thought. This book is about being a victim, which doesn't interest me. I liked the premise, but was disappointed by the story itself. Not very believable, but then amnesia stories rarely are.
B008J040RC|5.0|Awesome compilation album! The essential Slipknot music is all present, and will be enjoyed by both diehard maggots and casual fans. Definitely splurge for the '2-Disc Special Edition' (with the 'Download Fesival' CD), as the live content is OUTSTANDING.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're even thinking about buying 'Antennas To Hell', you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!
B000FC0SIM|3.0|I finished this rapidly and enjoyed his background CV section. Then we got into tips and advice. Avoid the passive, leave out unecessary words, don't plot-let the story flow. Read as much as possible and be assured you will always remain in the division of writer you start in, or at best move up one peg. Steve advises he reads 80 books a year, I might read 300; but that is not taking me any closer to writing an Irwin Shaw (ala Nightwork). If I don't plot, I have no idea where the hell I am going and end up getting screwed up. Steve does not have this problem, because he is in another class, but he fails to advise you how to really reach a flowing Nirvana of such unconsidered prose.<br /><br />I like Stephen King both as an entertaining writer and for the open gentleman he appears to be. Don't get me wrong, there are useful tips here; but tips for professionals, not for hopeful scribblers. He spends a lot of time talking like a guy who can do it (which he can); though not much here will help us who are struggling in the surf much.
B004LWZW9M|4.0|From Director Garry Marshall comes almost the same movie as \\"Valentine's Day\\" with a huge spoonful of moviestar sugar (Zac Efron, Halle Barry, Jessica Biel, Ashton Kutcher, Katherine Heigl, Jon Bon Jovi, Sophie Vergara, Lea Michele......................just the tip of the iceberg).  Though the differences between \\"New Year's Eve\\" and the cloying \\"Valentine's Day\\" aren't great they are substantial enough.  While VD dealt solely with romantic love as connectedness NYE opens up the range of things that connect us, from people to brotherhood/ sisterhood to friendships to locales to even work and competitive egos.  And,yes, romantic love is in there too.  Anyone who has seen VD has already essentially seen NYE but NYE is still worth watching for its very warm and even pained humanity and essentially kind heart.  There aren't a lot of movies out there that pull this off.  There are several relational storylines that stand out but, for me, the one that stands out the most sees Paul (Zac Efron), a young and energetic courier about town who has bigger dreams, encounter Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), a homely old maid who has decided that life has passed her by and she wants to do a bunch of things (like a bucket list) all in one day.  She has tickets to a hot concert that she couldn't care less about but would fly Paul to the moon and so she challenges Paul to make her dreams come true (and, no, none of them are sexual at all) all in a day.  Now these dreams are impossible as some of them require intercontinental travle.  Aha, but Paul is a smart one and he finds unexpected ways to make Ingrid's dreams come true.  And she truly lives on that day and Paul's initially selfish goal of doing this for Ingrid (he sees her as a means to an end) morphs into seeing her for her sake.  It was a nice and touching storyline.  One of many.

1589946634|3.0|Recently, my city experienced some pretty major storms resulting in about a week of power outages. After the second day of laying around my apartment bored I decided to find a board game that could be played by myself, Death Angel was the result. Right off the bat I began reading through the instructions to learn how to play the game, the only problem, these instructions are AWFUL. Things are written about as though they had already received a full explanation when actually they won't be given any definition until several pages later. After fumbling with just doing the starting placements of the decks I threw my hands in the air and decided to go to youtube for a guide, that turned out to be a good move, I could now understand the game. After finally watching the game played and understanding the rules I took to playing the game for myself. Overall I'd say I enjoyed it. It's a game that may lack all the joys of a great social experience that most board/card games provide but it makes up for that with some thought provoking strategy and chance mixed together. I would recommend this game to people who don't have power at their house and need to keep themselves occupied because they are hermits. =P
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it is very similar to the 'tiny zoo friends ' game but I think this one has better design. for those who aren't familiar with 'free ' games: yes they let you buy in-game currency for money. if you want something for your kids, do your research on the games and educate your kids on wise spending.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is great fun. I enjoy trying to build my village.  The only thing I have trouble with is liking. other villages.  It does not give me credit. just a glitche?
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|This is an amazing album, some people make a mistake when comparing this one with the 70's era. It is a \\"different\\" band, in its own right. There are discussions about the band should have called it quits after Waters left but no one says the same about when Barrett left, all non-sense of course. Every \\"incarnation\\" of Pink Floyd is amazing. Give this album a chance, headphones on, set the controls for the heart of the sun.<br />PD: I am not sure if this is a new remaster or the one that was included in the \\"Discovery\\" box set.
B008MBXFEM|4.0|This is a very, very good soundtrack and some of the tracks on here are simply epic (\\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" and \\"The Fire Rises\\" are two that immediately come to mind). I'm not necessarily a huge Hans Zimmer fan but he really seems to want to give his scores for the Batman films a little more character than usual and I admire his creativity. For instance, with \\"The Dark Knight\\", he introduced a simple dissonant chord that would serve as the Joker's theme and it can't be denied that it's extremely effective. Here, the villain Bane is backed up with a chant that echoes through several of the tracks and it really serves to give him an added edge to his already intimidating persona. This is one of those scores where nothing feels out of place and it is very easy to listen to without the need to skip tracks.<br /><br />Several people are saying that the score has not been mixed properly for this release and truth be told, it COULD sound a little better, maybe even a little crisper. For the casual listener however, I don't see this as being a deal breaker. It's still very good music and a fitting end to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I think this album is a great debut, only bummer is that there isn't more from them, yet! It's a perfect feel good album, best I've bought in a long time.

B008GXHOFW|3.0|this review should tell you everything:<br /><br />this is a real fun game great graphics. I love swinging webs because its fast transportation and it a great way to practice swinging when you have free time if you suck. it an awesome game.<br /><br />now here are the problems:<br /><br />1. this game is way to much money. it should be like $4.99 or $3.99.<br /><br />2. memory not bad but game could use less memory. make sure you have 7-730 milibytes (game requires 6 hundred and something memory. I don't remember  but you could find how much memory you need in other reviews.)<br /><br />3. may glitches<br /><br />4. on one of the missons you have to destroy 4 bombs.when you destroy the first one the second location for the other one will appear. as soon as you start to go towards it, your screen will freeze. wait a little while for you kindle to start working again. either let the battery drain or wait for it to unfreeze. try to update it if you can. (it froze my screen 3 times. all you can to is press the power button to turn it off and on that's about it. if you take chances you will ruin you kindle for good. the game needs an update.)<br /><br />that's all the problems for now I will put up more later.
B0087UN94E|4.0|Music appreciation is a very individualized. Just because I like it, it doesn't mean someone else will. I think its a very creative interpretation of Americana music. The video's really make a difference and is the way to go as far as I'm concerned. Look at the samples and decide for yourself.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool...Such a phenomenal work of fiction.<br /><br />Imagine a post-apocalyptic society that lives in a silo under the ground. Ok, now read about it and how that society is to be maintained over the course of decades (or centuries).<br /><br />In my summer of reading, this is my 4th book and it should have been my first. I can't stop telling everyone I know about it.<br /><br />So, two days ago I am reading and I am into part 5 and I thought I would read a bit more before bed. I got about 30 pages in and couldn't stop. I needed to know what happened to Juliette.<br /><br />This novel is gripping. You fully feel invested in the triumphs and disasters of the characters.<br /><br />5 may not be a high enough score for me.

0767812166|5.0|John Carpenter has done it again! While not being horror like ''the thing'', this movie is more of a drama and fantasy mixed together. ''Starman'' depicts us, humans in all our savage glory. After inviting aliens to our planet, the first thing government wants to do is autopsy. Sadly, that's what any government would do. I liked the love story of an alien and a human and think that actors were quite good. Jeff Bridges behaved well like an alien and Karen Allen was just amazing. It's definitely a movie that must be seen at least once. A cult classic from amazing director.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I thought if was one of the best games ive ever played. completely great would recommend if to everyone. please download, provided God wills ut.
0880793082|5.0|THIS IS THE MEDIUM VERSION! It is about the size of normal playing cards & a little shorter than the average Tarot card deck. The Green Box Thoth is the \\"Large/Standard Version\\". I believe the blue box is the SMALL version.<br /><br />The deck I received was NOT green, despite certain reviews. That was years ago, due to some publishing crap. The borders on this version are a light grey.<br /><br />I was first drawn to Thoth and Crowley six years ago, at the very start of my Tarot and spiritual journey. I remember there being only two choices in my mind when I placed the order for my first Tarot deck: RWS or Thoth. I went with the Original RWS, and boy do I regret it! I made the choice due to the vast majority of material being used to learn Tarot was based on the RWS, and the common controversy over the Thoth (and what I'm now beginning to read into: Crowley himself). I'm now wondering where I would be if I had chosen the Thoth instead of or in addition to the Original RWS...<br />Since then I've had Thoth and Crowley in the back of my mind for years now!<br /><br />The deck itself is fantastic! I do not see what others claim is so scary about this deck. It is intense, it is detailed, it is bold, and it is beautiful! But scary? No! I simply do not see it. It is not morbid or dark. While I may be a little darker than the average person, I am usually very perceptive. This, however, I simply cannot wrap my head around.<br /><br />I was concerned with the common issue of the Thoth lacking scenic pips. I do not know if I was misinformed or misinterpreted what others have said in regards to the Minors, but for whatever reason I was under the impression they would be minimalistic. While they may not display a full scene of imagry, the pips are very talkative! The expressive style of Harris' rendering of them, in conjunction with the keywords make these Minors VERY readable! Add in astrological correspondences and Quabala, and BAM! -In your face meanings.<br /><br />I can see myself making the purchase of the Large Thoth deck for study and futher clairification of Harris' artwork. -Something I never thought necessary with the RWS! Those are so basic and bland in comparison to Harris's depiction. The imagry itself, in conjunction with Crowley's mad genius enlightenment make this deck stand far above RWS in my mind. Yes, Crowley was a stickler with Harris' artwork, but I have read that she pressured him to create the deck; she paid him money to tudor her in the ways of magick. But, as such, every symbol, every colour, every \\"backdrop\\" has meaning! I've read that The Book of Thoth and Thoth Tarot are Crowley's magnum opus, the final culmination of 45 years of magickal/esoteric/spiritual study. That in itself makes this deck far more approachable to me. I cannot wait for the Thoth to \\"meet me\\" at whatever level, and I cannot wait for it to grow and adapt to my knowledge base!<br /><br />Finally, I must add that the \\"official\\" Magus card is my favourite! The others are nice, too, but this one just \\"fits\\" with everything I know about the card. Perhaps it is not important to some, but the fact that I had/have a choice and chose the original speaks volumes to me. I am very individualistic, and I love personalization; but in this case I felt it was not necessary. Crowley's final decison resonated with me, and I'm thrilled!<br /><br />As far as it not being a \\"beginner's deck\\" - If you want it, go for it! I certainly wish I did. This deck has opened up so many new windows and doors of study for me and I'm loving every minute of it!<br /><br />***Do yourself a favour and buy DuQuette's 'Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot'. Then, or in conjunction with, buy/read Crowley's own 'Book of Thoth'.***<br /><br />**Then look into: 'The Thoth Companion: The Key to the True Symbolic Meaning of the Thoth Tarot' by Snuffin seems pretty good, as do 'The Crowley Tarot: The Handbook to the Cards' (more in-depth) & 'Keywords for the Crowley Tarot' (more concise & better for purely divination purposes) both by Banzhaf.**<br /><br />*Do NOT buy: 'Tarot: Mirror of the Soul: Handbook for the Aleister Crowley Tarot' by Ziegler OR 'The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols' by Arrien. I've read lots of bad reviews on them.*re concise & better for purely divination purposes) both by Banzhaf.**<br /><br />*Do NOT buy: 'Tarot: Mirror of the Soul: Handbook for the Aleister Crowley Tarot' by Ziegler OR 'The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols' by Arrien.

I do sometimes wish they were organized by season instead of in just six different booklets, but the episode guide rocks! It even has background information on the show and pictures from the set! The box it comes in is great, perfectly sized to fit on a bookshelf, so it doesn't take up much space at all! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to buy this for themselves or as a gift!

0824835921|5.0|Remembering the Kanji volume 1 aims to teach the most important characters in a reasonable amount of time.  It does not aim to teach readings. Basically you use mnemonics to help memorize the individual characters quickly then later once you know the 2000 or so most important then you can start learning the readings and connecting the dots.<br /><br />Personally I think for most people learning speaking and writting seperately makes sense for both chinese and japanese.  Basically you learn speaking and writting seperately until you reach a decent level at writting then you'll already know the translation and may already be able to speak it and thus have less to memorize when you learn words (make associations).
7500117124|2.0|We have this at home for our son, so I bought it for a friend as a baby gift.  When I received the book, I was very upset to find out that the entire book was written in both English and either Japanese/Chinese/Korean characters.  It was too late for me to attempt to return the book and get a new copy, but very upset to have to try to explain this to the friend for whom I bought this.  The picture shows the characters, but the description did not describe that.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|50 shades of wow! Not a literary work of genius but damn fun reading! A real guilty pleasure! It's like having a legal affair or if you're lucky and read it with your own Christian Gray, it's great foreplay! Enjoy!
0345803507|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, but not as much as the two first ones. I think the author got us short on very important parts of the story, like Anastasia's and Christian's wedding and the birth of their child. I think she could have saved a lot of pages describing the numerous sexual encounters and give us a little bit more of the story behind the characters. Also I didn't like the way she described the wedding, in the past, as a recollection . However , I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, after reading the two first ones you just have to read this one, the author didn't disappoint, very entertaining trilogy of books. Looking forward to E. L. James new book ( I hope there is one).
B006JD48NM|5.0|Senna tells a real life tale of life in F-1.  Outstanding.  Easily out does the big budget movies on F-1.
0811879631|3.0|While the book very nicely presented, the content wasn't what I was expecting. 2/3 of the book is color scripts, while nice, I was expecting more in depth art from each film, concept sketches, digital renders etc. Maybe this was too much to cram into this book since they cover 12 films which is a lot of art to put into a book. My fault for not reading the description more carefully. Still, I'll keep it, nice addition to the library.
B000022TSH|3.0|...before some hipster tried to convince you it was one of the greatest films of all time - it just isn't that great.  Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining and I was engaged from beginning to end, but one of the best film experiences I've ever had it ain't.<br /><br />You spend the complete 2+ hours with the barely likeable persona of Jack Nicholson's role, only to discover that the character you should've been empathizing with the whole time has barely been developed by the end of movie.  The twist at the end is not nearly enough to support the weight of a movie this long, this film easily could have been 30 minutes shorter.  Sometimes I feel Polanski's ego requires his films to reach that magical 120 min threshold come rain or shine, like he needs viewers to make a \\"commitment\\" to watching his films.  I really like most of his films but they do tend to contain lots of dead air.<br /><br />Also, the so-called connection to the title - Chinatown, is a joke and feels tacked on.  All in all, this is definitely a decent movie that's worth seeing, just enter with an open mind and disregard the associated hype.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|The first movie was a piece of crap. This is supposed to be a reboot and its not a sequel since it has no ties to the other one. That being said, they should have found a different actor for Ghost Rider. Nicholas Cage is too old and goofy. The rider looks much better and he's violent and the villain was good up until he transforms into Blackout then he's just as goofy with the cheesy one liners, but has cool powers. I'm still debating if I should add this to my collection, same thing with Thor. I'll wait till both movies are under $4.
B008MEM24S|3.0|It's O.K. I was kind of expecting more out of Disney, because It doesn't have &quot;Story Break&quot; pictures, which makes it seem kind of pointless. Also, I think the music wasn't that great, and something makes it seem 'simpler', but I don't understand why. I recommend this for kids 7 and under. I think they should have a free version of this out so I could try it first. NOTE: Be careful how you spend a dollar.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use headphones and earbuds when running.  Earbuds won't stay in and headphones are cumbersome.  These lightweight headphones are PERFECT! They stay put and I can't believe the sound for such an inexpensive product.  You can't go wrong.
B006DDO1D0|5.0|This book is the result of a vivid imagination, a mountain of research, and a lot of heart. Stephen King's own life experience figures in as well (you will know when you hear that particular section). The nuance and depth of the story is stunning. King pulls no punches in terms of vivid portrayals of gore and mayhem (no surprise) but also shows a touching, poetic heart and tenderness in a beautiful, fully realized love story within the broader tale of Jake Epping's adventures into the world of the 1950's and 60's. Leitmotifs abound. I can understand why other reviewers have said they listen again. I have found that I often \\"rewind\\" parts of the book, one of the more appealing aspects of listening to a recorded book. The plot is historically based with certain \\"fudging\\" as King himself admits, but who cares. We are engrossed and fully involved. By the telling, you really have no idea how things are going to turn out! Right up to the crucial moment itself on the date of the title we don't know what will happen, and the coda to the main plot action is extremely satisfying.<br /><br />The reader of the audio book, Craig Wasson, not an 'A' list name - although a familiar one - shows his considerable chops as dialect and accent specialist here, as well as an emotionally involved and sympathetic performer. His voice characterizations are consistent and committed, many voices for the many characters, and each distinct in its own way. Of course, there are expected stereotypes, many of them funny and endearing. King's language is often visceral and blunt, and Wasson's delivery is terrific. This must have been a grueling process, reading and recording all this. The result is very much worth it. I started listening on a long car trip and was immediately engrossed in the unfolding of the tale, which has a circularity and interconnectivity to it that is remarkable. The return trip, and subsequent car and air travel provided more opportunities to return to the story. I was eager to, and knowing the next chapter was waiting was a great pleasure.<br /><br />I love audio books, and this masterful riff on history is one of the very best. Highest recommendation.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|No literary value. Author was overly repetitive with phrases like \\"heard rather than saw\\" which was annoying. It wasn't well written. However I enjoyed wasting a few hours reading about the edible and deliciously sexy Christian grey
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I,have been waiting for this set, but I think at 69$ it's too much. As much as I want this I'll wait for the price to drop below 50$. My take on the four movies is as follows.... Raiders is four stars, Temple is two stars, and that is being generous, Crusade is four stars, and crystal is four stars. Everybody has their opinion and that is mine.
0312641893|5.0|I wasn't entirely sure what to make of this novel when I first heard about it. I've never been drawn to stories of cyborgs, but something about this novel intrigued me. I'm so glad I read it. There's not a single thing I can find to complain about. Cinder, a sixteen-year-old cyborg with no memory of life before she had her surgery, lives with a stepmother who hates her. She's a very believable character, and you can't help but feel for her when things don't work out her way. Prince Kai was cute and amusing, though believable, given everything that he's had to deal with. I liked the romance with these two. They talk and tease each other, and I could understand what each saw in the other. Each of their fears and reactions to certain events seemed realistic, as well, which isn't always the case. It was nice to read.<br /><br />I loved the side characters, as well. Iko was adorable.  Peony and Pearl had their own distinct personalities, and her stepmother was cruel and despicable, but in completely believable way. She's horrible, but you can sort of pity her and understand why she does what she does. All of the characters made sense to me. They had different layers, which was nice. I've seen many retellings of Cinderella in my life, mostly as a small child, and I've never seen one with this much depth to it.<br /><br />I can't even really put into words how much I liked this book. I stayed up until almost 3 last night reading it, and even then I only stopped reading because my boyfriend wanted to sleep. I'm sad that I'm finished with it. I think I love the book even more because it started as a NaNo novel - so not only is it a great story, but also it's inspiring. Apparently each book in this four-book series is based on a different fairy tale. I'm excited to see how the series continues.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|I ordered this plus Corsair 8GB, Intel i5 2400, and Asus DVD drive.  It all arrived even a bit early (but see below about the memory).  It is a beautiful-looking box, and everything works very nicely and it is extremely quiet!<br /><br />I have not had any chance to check performance or the Windows Experience Index, but it FEELS fast.  I'm running Ubuntu Linux 12.04.<br /><br />Just a few items that contributed to 4-* rather than 5-*<br /><br />1) The screws that came with it are not the right size to match up with either the DVD or the HDD that I had.  It needs a smaller size (which I luckily had)<br /><br />2) The heat sink compound is pretty think and hard to spread evenly.  Maybe it all is these days, but that is different from anything I have used earlier.  Having only done this a few times it made me a bit nervous that I was getting good thermal contact.<br /><br />3) The documentation consists of only a single sheet of mostly pictures and diagrams.  The enclosed CD/DVD had a manual (in different languages) but it was exactly the same sheet, not a more detailed text.  Without anything more than pictures it was a bit more nerve-wracking to put the CPU in.  In particular, there were three things that the diagram seemed to say I should remove (mylar cover of CPU socket, mylar cover on the ICE thermal connector, and something else on the socket).  Unfortunately I could not really tell what was what from the diagram and I could only find 1 thing to remove.  It turns out that there was one additional cover but it was in the accesories box and not actually on the socket where it was supposed to be.<br /><br />A couple additional cautions (which don't contribute to lowering the rating, but I wish I had known).<br /><br />1) The HDD space is for a 3.5\\" drive, not a 2\\".  I was installing a disk from a laptop, and it works but does not physically fit well.  I suspect it will not be a good thing to use forever since there is not much thermal contact with the case.<br /><br />2) One of the SATA cables was pre-installed and threaded to the back of the case.  That was a bit mysterious until I realized that it actually was in a good position to plug into the DVD drive, and having it threaded through the case keeps it out of the way.<br /><br />3) The Amazon catalog page suggested \\"other who ordered this also got...\\" an Asus DVD drive, which seems fine, but also Corsair memory from a Marketplace vendor.  I did not notice that it was not fulfilled by Amazon, until after I ordered it the expected delivery time was a week out rather than the normal Prime 2-day.  I was pretty annoyed about this!  I finally ordered the same memory from Amazon directly; it was not only less expensive but arrived in 2 days.  (The marketplace version has not arrived yet and they refused to cancel it!).  So use caution!  Prime eligible no longer means it will be there in 2 days!  (I'll review the actual items and or the vendor separately).<br /><br />September 1, 2012:<br /><br />Another couple of cautions:<br /><br />1) There is a very weird BIOS setting called EuP \\"Energy using Product\\" (well duh!).  It is apparently a quick way to set up some energy saving functions, and when it is on,  Wake On LAN can not be enabled.  If disable EuP, you can enable WOL.  Would be nice if it were a bit clearer what this particular function is for.  The text for it says \\"Enable EuP function\\".  Thanks.<br /><br />2) This particular CPU (the I5 2400) does not support hyperthreads.  This is not Shuttle's fault; I should have checked the Intel web site more carefully.  I looked to be sure it supported multiple cores and virtualization accelerations, but did not even notice the hyperthreads.  Not a big deal for me, just a surprise.<br /><br />Oct 10, 2012:<br /><br />One thing that I never mentioned, and pretty small:  The 'suspend' function works well, but there is no indication from the outside whether the system is off or in suspend.  Usually systems flash the power light when itis suspended.  I thought there might be a BIOS setting, but I could not find one.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazon had this as their free app for Christmas and I was super excited because I was looking for something just like it.  Turns out it was cooler than I had originally anticipated. I primarily use it at home but taking it abroad is convenient in the event that I need to upload something to my cloud. Super fantastic!
B002LHRM2E|3.0|Although this is an easy read, I found it somewhat low in concepts and details.  I assumed that this was \\"the book\\" on Critical Chain, but I suspect there are much more succinct yet more thorough sources of information available.  This one, like Goldratt's \\"The Goal\\", is in a novel format, which does not add clarity or value in this case.
B0086700CM|5.0|its so addicting its a very fun game going through the jungle getting chased by monkeys. idk who wouldn't love it
1577314808|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs some practical wisdom on turning there life around. I recommend it even more for the jerk down the street who lets his ego get in the way of everything! I bought it at the recommendation of a friend not because i'm an egotistical maniac but because knowledge of the ego and it's role in human life is vital too understanding our desires and aspirations. I wish i could say more but my copy mysteriously disappeared. I think it was my dad.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|everything was good with this game until the update every time u play I'm always stopped because of ads disguised as rewards over all its an ok game though
B007HNFREW|5.0|I can't remember the last time I was so caught up in a television show. Yes, it is an HBO program, and yes there are large amounts of sex, violence, and some language, but life isn't always as clean, neat, and proper as some of us would like to imagine. I feel as though Game of Thrones has captured George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire brilliantly; a story which touches on every emotion one could have thought possible in a series. Don't let the few bad reviews keep you from witnessing cinematic gold. If you are uncomfortable with sex (and I don't mean a little bit), violence, and language, then steer clear. But if you are willing to take the entire series as the sum of its parts, then I can honestly say that you are in for a ride that you won't soon forget. Bravo HBO, for adapting this story so craftily and thoughtfully.
0786956291|5.0|I ordered this on a lark.  I \\"played\\" D&D back in the early to mid-1980s.  I put \\"played\\" in quotes because there was a lot more reading of rule books than actual playing because the rules were complex<br /><br />I tried to get back into D&D when 3.0 came out, but found it too complex for the time I could commit.<br /><br />So, I got this on a lark.  My kid was intrigued by the pictures on the box and wanted to play.  I kinda cringed that D&D's complexity was about to alienate yet another kid, but amazingly, we both had a lot of fun.<br /><br />The adventure that comes with this starter set is very cleverly designed for a new player.  It reads kinda like a \\"choose your own adventure\\", so a player can work their way thought the story without having someone to play Dungeon Master (which is always a huge impediment for new players).  Sure, the choices are a little limited, but it is a wonderful way to learn game mechanics.<br /><br />And...regarding game mechanics, I love the way this adventure is designed to be played with little more than a character name and race.  Rather than the old D&D system where you had to create your character first, this takes you through a series of choices and encounters that flesh out your character.  For example, in the first encounter, you have to choose whether to fight the goblins, cast a spell on them or help a wounded person.  Depending on your choice, it determines whether you are playing as a fighter, wizard or cleric.  Then it helps you fill in your various attribute scores AS YOU NEED THEM, so you kinda learn the game mechanics along the way.<br /><br />Very clever.  As I said, I had fun and so did my kid.  Now....down the road if you want to keep going, you're going to need some other rule books to expand your adventures, but this is a GREAT starter set.  I imagine it's even better for truly new players who don't have 30 years of legacy D&D knowledge rattling around in their brain.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|I read this book because I like the Kate Bush song and wanted to learn the story. It's quite slow-paced, as you might expect from such an old novel, but it's never boring.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT]<br /><br />It seems like pretty much everyone dies in it, it's natural death after natural death; the story would have been very different with modern medecine! It's easy to like characters one minute and detest them the next, plus it's quite difficult to grasp who is who initially; don't make the same mistake as me and look at a family tree because it sort of spoils the story when you find out who gets married etc.<br /><br />[END OF SPOILERS]<br /><br />It's a good story, and the final few chapters are very intense and fast-paced. Worth a read.

B0049P1VHS|1.0|This DVD set was advertised as a FULL SEASON 1 set, and lo and behold, when we go to watch it, it's only got the first 6 episodes. It's ridiculous that it is advertised as a full series.
B000002NZO|5.0|In 1970, Rolling Stone magazine flushed this album down the toilet with: \\"It's spotty, poorly defined, at times innately boring, and should be avoided by all but the most rabid Genesis fans.\\" I had purchased and listened to this first studio album by Genesis before reading this excerpt from the music rag, and wow... was I ever surprised. Here is it, 42 YEARS later, and I cannot find many \\"modern\\" acts that can even come close to the brilliance demostrated in these six songs. I was already familiar with their Phil Collins era, but when I decided to order the earlier albums (the namesake, \\"Nursury Cryme\\" and \\"Foxtrot\\") I wasn't sure what to expect. When I slid \\"Trespass\\" into my stereo, \\"Looking for Someone\\" hit me like a brick house. It's my favorite cut from the album, and it is absolutely worth the price of the CD alone... \\"Dusk\\" and \\"The Knife\\" are also way up there for repeat listenings. Some of the songs lack a sense of continuity, but if you listen to them as individual counterparts to the whole, then you will see how stupid and ignorant those idiot critics actually were on the 'Rolling Stone' rag payroll back in 1970 - when the world was still reeling from the Beatles breakup, and subjecting their limited brain cells with the bombardment of the easy-listening AM radio fluff of the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Sonny and Cher, and the Allman Brothers... I was there - I know... I cannot recommend this album enough. When I tell you that I was \\"wowed\\" by Peter Gabriel's voice - which I was already familiar with from \\"Melt\\" and \\"Security\\", I mean I was \\"WOWED\\"! The only negative comment I have on this CD, and I'm afraid it won't even matter, is in the fact that the impressive guitar work of the original guitarist - Anthony Phillips - is much subdued, in favor of Tony Banks' keyboard work. With the exception of \\"Dusk\\" and \\"The Knife\\", his brilliance (sadly) won't be loud enough to hear over the bombardment of organs, mellotons, and everything else, and I find this both sad and technically unacceptable. Go ahead and order it anyway... you'll love it.
0345803485|1.0|Like many other people, I read this book due to the hype surrounding it. I did not read any reviews prior to reading the book so that I would form my own opinion about it. After completing the book I was relieved to find that all my criticisms were shared by practically 3000 other reviewers (ironically, the same number of people to like the book and award it 5 stars).<br /><br />I'm not going to write a long, bad review on this book because what more can I bash about this book that 3000 people haven't already said? I will just say that I agree with other negative reviews that the book sounds very immature, the author repeats herself FAR too much, it's impossible to fall in love with the characters or develop a relationship with them, and the story goes no where. I would also like to note that I am 28 years old and not opposed to an overly-fantasized erotica novel, but this book was just way too unbelievable with the number of orgasms each of the main characters has.<br /><br />Although I am curious whether a real story actually develops in the next two books in the series, especially since I have already wasted time reading 500 pages of the first book anxiously awaiting for something good to happen and being let down, I will NOT be supporting this author by purchasing another one of her poorly written novels. Besides, if I have to read about this girl's inner goddess one more time or about how hot the guy is, I will go insane! If you were begrudgingly reading through this book hoping that the story would pick up, don't get your hopes up like I did. The story doesn't even end with a cliff hanger to get you to purchase the next two books - thank goodness!
1401234542|4.0|As someone else stated, Green Lantern readers have gotten a well needed change of pace in this book. Since Green Lantern rebirth, Hal Jordan and the rest of the corps have been battling non-stop. This book shows the result all the wars have had on Hal and the rest of the corps involved. I think that Geoff Johns did a great job showing the effects being a full time Green Lantern has had on Hal's life. Thinking that Hal's life would not change after being off the planet for months at a time is extremely unrealistic. Also,I love the fact that Sinestro is a green lantern once again. I think that it gives the book a well needed change in dynamics. Even though he's wearing a green ring, Geoff Johns doesn't paint Sinestro as a hero, in fact, Sinestro kills someone in every last issue he's been in as a Green Lantern! The change in pace has been good for the story and has allowed us to get reinvested in the main characters as we strap in for the upcoming alpha war! Great Book and awesome series so far! Keep it up Geoff and Doug!
B008K8H9C6|4.0|Not since armadillo run have I gotten so caught up in a physics game. Delightful and challenging... Absolutely worth a dollar.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite romance authors. Whenever I want a good love story, I know to turn to the master of the genre. To date, Mr. Sparks has never let me down. The Lucky One is not exception. It is a wonderful tale of love and second chances. Beth has had an unhappy marriage and is raising is a single parent. Will she allow herself a second chance for love with the handsome, mysterious stranger who enters her life most unexpectedly? Love, secrets, regret - this book has it all. If you haven't read it, definitely give it a try!

B00280LYIC|5.0|When I was leaving my review for this book, Amazon asked me if I was over 13. Yes, I am, way over 13, but I still liked this book immensely! I first started reading it with my nephew when babysitting, but pretty soon, I was engrossed in the story myself. The Lightening Thief is a great tale of adventure for both kids and adults alike.
0345803485|1.0|I have never felt the need to write a bad review but after reading Book 1 and only half of Book 2 I couldn't read any more and I felt such a strong need to write something. I cannot believe the hype this book has been given. I was curious because of it and yes I was sucked in. What a disaster. This is such a badly written book that I thought I was reading a Danielle Steele novel with a few tasteless sex scenes thrown in. I would not even insult the very concept of erotica to use this term for this book. Complete and utter rubbish and a waste of money.
B001E45XT4|4.0|This is a great headset for the price. The mike is clear, the build is sturdy enough, and it is very comfortable with all the padding.  There are a couple of minor things that get in the way of a 5 star review though. The first is that I need an external sound card to get the best sound out of it. I read the other reviews before purchasing these so I ordered a Turtle Beach Amigo II with them. Of course I had to check how they sounded through my Satellites inboard card, and the other reviews were right. It needs the extra boost. The second downside is that while the ear pads are replaceable, they are no longer available through Plantronics. Now I can't see anything really happening to the ear pads through normal use. However, if you have a cat like mine, something is bound to happen to them somewhere down the line.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Steven Spielberg's drama War Horse is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's a good story with drama and comedy. On the other hand, the characters are underdeveloped, and there's no resolution to the initial problem with the landlord. It's long, but not long enough. And the stories never intersect with each other with Joey being the sole focus of the film. Not a bad idea in principal, but in theory, it doesn't work. The film should have shown Emilie at the end with her grandfather, Joey and the Narracott family.  And the score by John Williams was powerful as always. A comeuppance for the landlord's arrogant (and apparently womanizing) son should have been shown, along with a romance for the young Narracott boy.<br /><br />The finale, though, was beautifully filmed. Reminiscent of Rhett kissing Scarlett amidst the burning night sky in Gone With The Wind. And the duck was hilarious.<br /><br />A better, cohesive script would so have served the movie well, along with a longer run time.<br /><br />The Artist earned the Academy Award for Best Picture.
0131480057|5.0|Everything you've ever wanted to know. I highly recommend this as your starting point to more complex SysAdmin.<br /><br />I agree with previous reviewers that it might not provide the best starting point for linux (some chapters don't linearly introduce topics, but instead require jumping around to understand -- if you don't already understand). But for anyone capable of a bit of googling it should be required reading.
B0079K4WMG|5.0|This is a apocalyptic movie about a strange virus that is destroying the senses of humans one by one. However, humans quickly adapt and move on with their everyday life.<br /><br />Eva Green is absolutely fantastic (as a statistician working in an hospital) in her role like in all movies that she appeared (Cracks is my favorite for the moment). I wish she would appear in more movies.<br /><br />While many people may not like the movie, from a scientific point it makes sense that a virus can and may be one day infect a particular cell population in the brain that is responsible for our senses.<br /><br />We have officially five senses: Sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. It is quite amazing how the movie demonstrates the adaptability of humans. Once a sense disappears, after a few weeks of panic, people adapt and move on with their life. That is probably the best part of the movie, beside the love story between Eva Green and Ewan McGregor.<br /><br />The movie is well done and while it is focusing on the two love birds, we get the message of adaptability.<br /><br />Without being a spoiler, four of the senses disappear during the movie and the one not gone by the time the movie is over (touch) is the most intriguing of all. Once I got into the movie, I was expecting to see what would be the consequences of losing the touch feeling. We will never know since the movie doesn't tell us but we can guess many different scenarios.<br /><br />Great movie, five stars all around for everything!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is addicting I cant stop playing it amenity recommended it to a friend of mine. it starts out easy and gets harder.
0307887448|5.0|When I picked up Ready Player One I wasn't really sure what to expect. I kept hearing claims like \\"80s rock opera\\" and \\"geek's dream\\". Those are so the truth. I've never really been a big 80s fan. I'm a child of the 90s, sure I watched some of the movies, listened to the music, and played some of the games...but it never really pulled me in. Reading Ready Player One had me wanting to go back in time. I started a list of music to hunt down, books to read (or re-read), movies to find...yep, I'm ready. Who knows maybe I'll need the knowledge.<br /><br />I've always been a tentative gamer. I play some, but not much really hooks me. If OASIS, the game/way of life in Ready Player One existed, I'd be playing it. Throughout the entire book I kept seeing similarities between it and a game I've mentioned playing before - Second Life. Sure, it's a ramped up version, but SO close. Because of having played it I could easily see how the outside world can slip away and you can be so absorbed into this alternate reality.<br />On that same note though, you can't help but feel a bit sad that these people don't really know about the real world at all. It's set in a very near-distant future, is this possibly what the world could be like in 30 or so years?<br /><br />The entire idea behind Ready Player One is fascinating. They live in this society in which the real world is devastated, instead they live in OASIS. They attend school there, they work, they explore, they play. And now they try to find what is essentially the answer to their prayers - a lot of money and ownership of the company behind OASIS. Potential Willy Wonka inspiration? Of course, everyone wants that control.<br /><br />Wade is a believable character, he's the ideal fanboy. He worships Halliday and knows every detail of his life and everything he enjoyed. Wade's friends also won my heart. Of course, there's a threat of a company wanting the fortune and power for themselves.<br /><br />Cline explains his fictional world in great detail, but manages to keep it fun. Even non-fans of the 80s are going to be able to get what's going on and probably pick up on many of the references. That said there is TONS of trivia covering 80s pop culture. I had a blast trying to find potential references to pop culture and trying to decode what the puzzles could mean. Self-proclaimed geeks are going to fall in love with this book.<br /><br />Note: Ready Player One could arguably be considered adult or YA. I feel it's the type of book that could fit all readers that have a knowledge or interest in the 80s or gaming.<br /><br />I received my copy of Ready Player One: A Novel in exchange for my honest opinion.
1468161660|4.0|Great story. Different then the most typical romance stories. The story doesn't always go in the direction that you expect it too, which keeps it interesting and makes it hard to take a break from reading it. Hard to put down. I read it in one sitting.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely love it!!!!!!!!!!!! I've read it twice already. Yes, it has flows and yes it may not be perfect but it's exciting and smart and interesting and, ladies, please tell me that at some point while you've read it you didn't want to move to Seattle and find this Christian Gray person????????????
B0026NBZDU|5.0|Yes, the novel is clever and has a couple of terrific twists.  Yes, it is well written.  And yes, it manages to be original while at the same time paying homage to one of literature's greatest writers, Charles Dickens.  But in my humble opinion, the best part of this book is that the author clearly had fun writing it and has managed to create an enthusiastic joy ride through Dickensian England that leaps off the page.  Reading it was like riding down a hill on a terrific, old fashioned sled.
0785162348|5.0|This book is exactly what I expected as it shows a lot of concept arts and design details.<br />It shows the differences and the evolution of the characters from the first movie they appeared to this one.<br />A must have ;)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is everything you need. It provides numerous versions of the Bible, it provides reading plans,  and even can read to you.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game so much!  its addicting and keeps you wanting to play. although it runs outran acorns fast its still fun. plus its so easy to get more coins!!

B005LAIGW8|1.0|I wasn't a big fan of the 1st one but this one doesn't even measure up to that low standard.  It's probably one of the worst comic book movies made since CGI made them laughable & many of those were probably better.  I'd rewatch Catwoman over this easily.<br /><br />Spider-man & the most recent Hulk movie are good examples where focusing on the human character as much or more than the heroic persona can really work.  This is the exact opposite.  It spend way too much time telling a bad story with Johnny Blaze.  This movie may've been better with more actual Ghost Rider clips but I'm not even sure about that as those weren't even that entertaining.<br /><br />I usually don't give out 1 star reviews but this isn't even worth a rental IMO.  I'm sorry I bought it except then I'd still be anticipating it.  At least now I know.<br /><br />Sadly I am still waiting for a good Ghost Rider movie and the 1st one seems a lot better now than before I watched this.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|We love this show! There is never an episode that leaves us lacking intelligent laughter or witty conversation! Would recommend for anyone in the market for either!
B008MEM24S|1.0|I cannot play it on the kindle even thou it took the order. Do not buy it. It does not work with it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I bought this book on kindle after reading several reviews that said this book was a great suspense novel. Unfortunately, I thought the book could have been a lot better. The idea of the plot is interesting, but extremely implausible. I didn't like any of the main characters - they seemed so cliche and predictable. The book had its moments...but mostly I thought it was a little dull. The biggest disappointment by far was the book's ending. The author had a chance to redeem her book with a satisfying ending, but instead I reached the last page and realized the book didn't have an ending at all. Save your money...this book isn't worth the price or the time to read it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is super fun! Addicting as well. It would have been better if it was free for Kindle Fire! Other than that its cool. I definitely give it five stars, everyone needs to play this game!
B0086DBE62|4.0|I was not going to watch this film since the previews made it look like a dorky film for fourteen year olds.  When I found out that Tarseem Singh directed it I decided I had to give it a go.  I was not disappointed.  I had fun watching it.  I liked most of the plot and loved the scenery, settings, and costumes.  I also found the characters satisfying as twists on the sleeping beauty assemblage.  For a summer pop corn mucher this is an excellent film.
B005LAIH54|5.0|If you are a fan of Greek Gods then this is a must, Its one the best That I have seen.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I love this show! As a bookworm I don't watch TV as much as other people my age but this show is a major exception for me. I've always loved fairy tale retellings so when I saw a preview for the show while at the movies last summer I was so happy to see that something so unique was coming to TV. I love it when they take the stories that we think we know and turn them on their head. I especially applaud the creativity that went into the Little Red Riding Hood retelling. I also love the fact that Snow is lively and has a backbone and a mind of her own in this show which she tends to lack even in the many modern retellings I've read. I also love the little actor who plays Henry that kid knows his stuff.
0345803485|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. With all the talk about racey \\"mommy porn\\" I thought I'd get something exciting and erotic. I've read Harlequin Romances with more steamy scenes. The characters were flat, the ending epiphony was rushed and barely motivated, the writing style hard to get through. By the end I had no desire to continue with these characters. Even the topic of domination/submission wasn't really explored. There are more books out there worthy of being called \\"mommy porn\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|games are easy and fun to play. not crazy about the point system but I guess of I play enough ill get all the points I need
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun and variety. takes a bit to unlock some games though. I think if it didn't take so many coins it would be better.
B00011KHTM|5.0|I ordered this to use on my iMac 17\\" which now has the dreaded vertical line disease, in fact every time I turn it on there are two or more new vertical lines on it, I realized that at some point the screen will have so many lines that I will no longer be able to see anything except vertical lines.  Purchasing a new LCD for it is cost preclusive, since it ranges anywhere from $300 to $1000 dollars just for the LCD, then you have to take it apart and re-assemble it.  Too much money and a real pain.<br /><br />So I bought this and plugged it into my older 37\\" TV, which has a VGA input for just such an endeavor.  It works well, and is pretty crisp for a VGA connection.  Since I am running OS X 10.5 (Leopard) on the iMac I am able to use the remote and Front Row to play my movies and TV shows which I have in iTunes.  It also works well for playing internet content.<br /><br />Not much to say about the connector itself, it is a connector, mini DVI to VGA and it works.  It's an Apple connector, so it's pretty durable and well made, fits perfectly as expected.<br /><br />If you are in the same boat I am, this works for an otherwise usable iMac from that era.  It's important to note that the newer iMacs do not have mini DVI ports, they use mini Displayport ports, so this would not work on a newer iMac.  Check the manual to see which one you need, they are not the same even though they look about the same.<br /><br />Anyway this is a good quality connector.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008MEM24S|4.0|a lot of fun like Where's My Water. would be better if the Secret File levels had a link directly back to the main levels, rather than having to go to the main title each time...
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books. I know what most people are saying, that it's a mommy porn book, but I thought is was beautifully written. I loved the fact that it could transport me into a world that I have never experienced. Great Job E.L.James, I would love to read more of your stories!!:)
B005DI66N4|5.0|Really good read!  If it was a work of fiction, you would think it was not believable. Since it was a true story, you have to marvel at all these men went through.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's pretty good I like a lot of the games but some of them are kinda hard but other wise its pretty fun!!!!!
B0086DBE62|3.0|This is a silly version of the tale, very comical. Unfortunately, the script lacks<br />wit and some of the slapstick is just infantile. It's enjoyable, nonetheless. It<br />just could have been a lot better. The story is inventively retold, and both Snow and<br />the Prince are winning personalities. Julia Roberts' role, however, is written in<br />one key throughout the film, leaving her with little to do other than affect a jaded<br />cruelty that gets a bit tired. The dwarfs are the film's weakness, because their material<br />is the least interesting: they're supposed to be lovably feisty, like the Dead End Kids.<br />There's an interesting twist near the end; see if you can guess it before it's revealed.
0312641893|3.0|I bought this on a whim as some light reading. Its a fun twist on the original story, and the writing really is quite witty at times. The main weakness is way too much foreshadowing. If you're looking for a bit of mystery this probably isn't the book for you. All in all though the world created is rich in detail, and at turns thoughtful, teen angst, and funny. This author shows a lot of potential, and while I did enjoy this book I'm thinking that her future ones are only going to get better.
B005K17RU0|5.0|app works for fire had to enter zip not location, excellent for the price includes everything I was looking for.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow starts off with basic puzzles but as you go on, gives you more and more challenging puzzles and it keeps you entertained for a long time. Personally, I love it.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|One huge let down! Evil always wins the day?? What kind of ending is that? I had hoped for some piece of hope for the ending..The last ten pages left nothing and answered nothing. All this...led to this ending?? I hope Mr. Martin is enjoying his money because I would never read him again.
B007QXU0ZO|4.0|good cd , i do recomend listening to entire cd before buying to see if you like more then one song, otherwise, just down load the one song
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I purchased the Blu-Ray copy of P&P.  My mother introduced me to this movie as a child, but after reading the book twice figured it was time to purchase my own copy.  The color is awesome, and the story line leaves nothing out and is as enjoyable as reading the book itself.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Country Strong contains wonderful music and a deep, hollywood sent message about fame and the blind hidden side of it. The power that this country singer has in her own career is shocking, beczause she has so little.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and I love how you can get different achievements and power ups.
B00116FT6M|5.0|You'll be up on your seat with the happiness and joy that this musical sets free. You'll fall in love with the music, the humor, the setting and everything else. Love this movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game, if you're OCD like me and want to complete levels in the least amount of moves, they provide hints, so it doesn't become overly frustrating!<br /><br />Overall a must buy game, the awesomesauce!
1400049628|5.0|I love this book.  It is well written.  But I am sure any real zombie lover will already know this is the must have book for anyone who wants to live thru the Zombie Apocalypse.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|This was a great movie! And for many reasons:<br /><br />1. Each character served an excellent purpose!<br />2. Most of the actors were great with their characters!<br />3. They got down most of the major details from the graphic novel!<br /> Most of them...<br />4. The entire movie had a nice, dark, brooding mood to it!<br />5. The movie gave us viewers some nice twists on historical moments (the famous<br />kissing photo from the end of the war, President Kennedy being killed,<br />Studio 54, etc.)<br />6. The costumes were well designed!<br />7. Rorchact (did I spell his name right?) was definitely the best character in<br />the movie, and one of the best characters ever created for the DC universe!<br />8. The visual effects were stunning and wonderful!<br />9. I like how they gave other actors a chance at playing the title roles and<br />not too many over famous people!<br />And finally...<br />10. They said this graphic novel could not be made into a movie in our lifetime,<br />boy were they wrong (who ever said it...)!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. If they had done two, possibly three movies of Watchmen they could have given us<br />more detail to each of the main characters!<br /><br />I sall this movie on opening night and loved it! But this is<br />just my opinion! I personal think it was great!<br />My grade; B+ or four stars!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|What an enchantingly addicting hidden object game! Great graphics and an interesting story line...I find I am wrestling the app away from my kids!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Definitivelly a great challenge. Addictive and fun for all ages. Never thought a game so simple will provide so much fun.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Prequel Trilogy are my favorite 3! Awsome effects great stories! Acting is better in these I believe as well. I'm a fan of the original 3 also but, I just really like the Prequels better.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show, this pilot!! I can't wait to watch season 5. It's worth to pay to watch this show!!!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I was stunningly surprised at how wonderful this film is.  It is modern, yet classic, moody, atmospheric, and memorable.  I could honestly go on and on listing the moments and the scenes which stand out to me, and there are many.  It's just wonderful.<br /><br />I proudly give a round of applause to James Watkins, Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, and Janet McTeer.<br /><br />Wow!  Wow!  Wow!
B003568FR6|5.0|Level 2 is definitely harder than Level 1, but it's also different, which makes it both interesting and useful for working out.  Jillian is good at showing and explaining, and having the two women doing the moves in the background doing them at different rates helps a lot for newbies (like me). I'll be moving to Level 3 soon, and then I plan on starting over with larger weights, so I definitely find the videos useful--especially since I'm able to stream them to my TV or laptop (I've even done Level 1 in hotel rooms while traveling).
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is fun as well as addicting. my son and I compete on a regular basis and of course he kicks my butt
B006RUJST6|5.0|Oh where to even begin! I loved these books so much, by far my favorite books i have read this summer. I cried a lot, and was rooting for Lake and Will all along! What a fabulous book i can not wait to read more from this author she was fabulous! i read both books in a day i stayed up all night i had to know how it was going to end. thank you!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has been a real blessing for me. The different reading plans are so appropiate for the different issues in life. And having this app is convenient when you don't have your bible in hand.
B006LSZECO|5.0|i enjoyeed every second of this. the villain is truly diabolical. you will be very surprised. dont read too many revies and ruin the suspense. i think this should be a movie.
B0058VW36U|5.0|love this game.one of my favorite games. they should make more games and levels about cut the rope. super super fun
B005K17RU0|2.0|Great user interface, great graphics, BUT displays our town (and doppler activity) 20 MILES SOUTH OF ACTUAL CORRECT PLACE! How strange is that? Haven't found a better-looking app, but can't stant the skewed locations.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Amelie is an easy contender for my favorite movie.  Amelie is shy, but don't confuse that with passive - she demonstrates in her story that she's anything but!  As she sets out on her adventure, she does so in such a charming, quirky way that she pulls the viewer right in.  We are ALL Amelie.  We cheer for her.<br /><br />I wish more American films were like this: not wearing it's heart on it's sleeve, not afraid to be a little gentle, a little tender while at the same time being hilariously funny!  The actress who plays Amelie is gorgeous, a true beauty that any man would easily fall for.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love that this application syncs with all your devices.  Keeps you organized and makes shopping lists a breeze. Great for keeping travel information in one place.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Im almost done with this book and cant put it down, great read, great stroll down memory lane, and a great storyline
B008B7OQHM|5.0|On the special edition, does it come with a dvd?  If so, is it with the videos?  It don't say on here if it does or not.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Sorry folks, these books were just plain boring.  Yeah it had a lot of \\"sex\\" stuff, but really????  Come on!  Sounds like it was written by a man who has no real knowledge of how a woman is wired.  I found myself skipping the unrealistic \\"sexual sub/dom\\" stuff and just reading the story which was weak at best.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I played the game and loved it at first. there was none of the problems that had been mentioned. now it restarts everytime I close the game and it keeps freezing. gameloft really needs an update
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! I use it all the time at work.  It's the perfect size for the kindle, the numbers are large and the memory allows you to see pasts calculations.
B00406UK5A|3.0|3.3 stars<br /><br />The extras here feature various cast etc saying that they were going for Gladiator-but-bloodier here. They got mostly the blood, as this lacks much of Gladiator's feel and vision. What it does have is buckets of CGI blood spurting from every wound!<br /><br />The blu-ray is so clear that the crazy amounts of blood are silly enough, but then they had to make them even more crimson in post? Ridiculous and really b-movie in a bad way, often negating some occasionally decent performances. West is good, but I just can't stop from thinking \\"McNulty with a sword!\\" every time I see him.<br /><br />Perhaps far too accurate in some ways, Centurion is for those who like their films to look like video games, blood and guts and all. I prefer some subtlety and suggestion over rampant naked gore, but each to their own.<br /><br />A must-see for serious slash and hack fans in any case.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|i hate this movie so muck that i even like batman and robin 1997 better !!!. the reason i hate this movie is the joker he is way to crazy to the extreme and the action is bad and it is violent and when i have kids i would rather make them watch batman and robin 1997 . i give this a 1/4 i am disappointed of this movie
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great game it is fun for everyone! you can have multiple persons play on it keeps track!and nobody has to play just your game ! they have updates only every once in a while and they've worked out all the kinks! FUN Fun fun!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|this movie had better acting, action,and characters then the dark knight. so go watch if your a batman fan. i give this movie a 5/4 you will love this move!!
159420229X|5.0|This book is going to enter one to one of my favorite list.<br /><br />It is on a quest started by a novice writer (the author) which goes to the american national memory championship to make an article about it. An observer which is a master in memory tells him that he can easily participate in this contest if he just practices.<br /><br />As a test Joshua begins to practice the capability of using his memory. He learns the tricks of the mind and deliberate practice technics to enhance them.<br /><br />As the plots goes on, the writer examines the history of the mind. Going from ancient Greece to the middle ages up to today. He examines how we use our memory, how it evolved through history and how we can use it in the future.<br />By examining the worlds best memory capabilities to the person with the least, he manages to see why and how we can use our brains. The book shows a lot of tricks some can do to have a better memory. It also examines how to practice to achieve it.<br /><br />The book had a lot of resembles to topics in other books, like the \\"The Invisible Gorilla\\", \\"Talent is overrated\\" and \\"The power of the habit\\" from the memory perspective, all written in a very fascinating manner.<br /><br />The story is fluent well written. it started form a journalist making a story of a contest and ended with him winning the national championship. At the end Joshua announced that memory tests won't be his topic in life. I hope his next book is going to be as good as this.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown was raised near my home in Central Arkansas and I work with his sister in law, so his story is one that I am familiar with and can put faces to. I am thankful that this book was written to help many of us understand more about the courage of and the sacrifices made by our military men, women, and their families. The title, \\"Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown\\" is very appropriate for his life story.
6305127697|5.0|this dvd arrived much earlier than the scheduled due date...the packaging was great and the dvd was also in great shape...
0142403873|5.0|First saw this book in a store in Kilkenny, Ireland, and knew we had to bring it home. This is a fantastically creative story young kids really get into - a must read for 3-5 year olds!
0783226063|5.0|This dvd arrived very early almost a week before the scheduled arrival time ...the packaging was ok and the dvd is also in great shape..
031620157X|5.0|I've read reviews where people talk about how unimaginative this story is. But I don't think they realize just how young Chris was when it was first concieved. Chris Colfer started thinking up this story during the ages 7 through 10. When he was 10 he realized he didn't know enough words to do the story justice, so he shelfed the idea until he had enough words. Chris has spoken in talk shows about how the story hasn't changed too much from when he first imagined it (now he has his adult humor added in there). Realizing that this story is basically from the imagaination of a 10 year old makes it that much more amazing on top of how amazing the book already is.<br /><br />Chris is a wonderful storyteller. He spends great attention to detail. There are so many twists and turns and surprises in this story that it's never boring. The backstories are refreshing and entertaining. I feel for characters I never thought I would give 2 cents about. The emotions are there. I laughed (startling those around me). I cried. I waited with anticipation of what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Chris Colfer is an author that I will be following throughout his career.<br /><br />I just have to admit that I didn't read his book. I wanted him to read it to me as I followed along, so I bought his audiobook as well. And let me just say, hearing the characters speak the way Chris has heard them in his head for the last 12 plus years, well, it's an experience I will forever cherish. :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very easy to see and use I love it! not much else to say besides. that it's simple .............................................. it's a calculator maybe you should make the one used for college
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not put this book down!!  An excellently written science fiction thriller which keeps you engaged.  I definitely recommend this book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very good and useful app. Able to syn across many different platforms. Love it and used it frequently. Glad that it is free too.
0446310786|5.0|What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's one of the greatest books in American history. Atticus Finch defines what men should be. Just terrific.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is easily the most addicting puzzle game I have ever played. so simple, yet challenging. If you're a puzzler like me, this game is for you!
0345803485|2.0|Let's see, how can I summarize this book? Gorgeous, perfect, successful, talented, self-made gazillionaire with low self-esteem and \\"issues\\" from childhood abuse falls head over heels in love at first sight with average, naive college girl with even lower self-esteem. He pursues her for five minutes, then they have lots of uninteresting sex, which produces thermonuclear orgasms. The End.<br /><br />First off, the author should write what she knows. A Brit can't write a believable story about life in the Pacific Northwest without extensive research (Reading the Twilight series is NOT sufficient!). Suspension of disbelief only goes so far.<br /><br />Second - EDITING! Grammar and spelling ARE important! And sentence structure! Jeez! (Sorry, couldn't resist)<br /><br />Third - The sex is repetitive, boring, predictable, and badly-written. Romance and character development are non-existent. The whole dom/sub theme is unrealistic - again, write what you know!<br /><br />Other notes:<br /><br />The \\"inner goddess\\" schtick was just annoying and overused.<br /><br />Just my cantankerous opinion, but I think narratives written in the present tense are awkward and gimmicky.<br /><br />\\"The way his pants hang from his hips\\" - The image I get is that Christian is so emaciated that his bones protrude.<br /><br />If Mary Sue/Bella/Ana bites her lip one more time, I'm gonna pop her on the chin.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out simply enough and becomes more challenging as it goes along. Great way to pass the time. Looking forward to the more difficult levels.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The lightning thief is not only a childs book but a book for all ages. When I heard about the percy jackson series I thought I wouldn't like it, but when tried it I loved it. Honestly I am now a proud owner of all the P.J. series books and have been hooked on greek mythology since. I am now who everyone goes to for greek mythology at my school instead of the teachers. So its almost like learning but more fun. You dont even know your learning then bang you know the big three gods are and the others, but im not going to spoil them for you. You just have to read this book.
0345803485|5.0|First book [[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]] felt like a Ciderella story written by teenagers with a bad ending. A few days later, purely on the amazon's fourth review star, I read the second, and then the third book late into the night.<br />At the end of the third book, the beginning of the first book in the trilogy was presented from a different angle, like in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. It prompted me to re-read the first book again.<br /><br />On the second read, on emotional level Grey has morphed from de Sade to Kurt Russel's character Sgt. Todd in movie Soldier, incapable of having human traits and feelings. His money and propensity to copulate were all of a sudden clearly presented as a coping mechanism that brought him no joy. He has to manipulate machines, companies, and submissive women to experience satisfaction that gives temporary relief, but doesn't improve his obsessive-compulsive condition.<br />Everything I thought was wrong with the book the first time I read it: composite Beauty an the Beast-esque characters, repetitions, subtle movements, inner monologues, has fallen into place in the profound description of a damaged man with OCD+ and a woman who thinks she is strong enough not just to relieve symptoms, but somehow cure this twisted, unstable, self-loathing overachiever.<br />The annoyance about descriptions of Grey's thumbs faded, and I could clearly see them as his robot-like premeditated compulsions towards women since Grey was enticed into D/s lifestyle at a young age as a way to survive and force the body to release anger. If he were any older than his 27 (going on 42 in business and emotional age of 15, and sometimes 4), the libido expectations would be lowered, and Ana being a virgin at 21 would have ended up being a sad May-December arrangement.<br />Anastasia's attempts to help him out of his dark tunnel by going as far as experimenting with pain transformed her from the \\"door mat\\", as one reviewer said, to one of the bravest female characters. She thinks she fails, but her innocence and non-attachment to material things have rocked the very foundation of Grey's lifestyle, but that's book 2,  [[ASIN:B007IXWKUK Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]...<br />Grey thought Anastasia was self-contained, and a mystery. I see her as high-functioning Autistic, folks, and a true Virgo. The words come to mind from the movie Color of the Night where Bruce Willis charachter's fellow shrink says, \\"She is not well, you are not well, and to you it feels like love\\". That's what throws people off on the first read of book 1, they keep looking for a love story, and it's all about therapy and self-help! Anastasia draws boundaries and comunicates her needs at the very end of book 1 and runs.<br />Book 2: Grey runs to his shrink who makes it clear that to keep this woman Grey has to change, and he tries. By the end of book 3 Grey channels his stocker tendencies into an appropriate role of a protector, and Anastasia learns how to communicate better about her needs. Grey confirms and Ana learns that just because he is paranoid, it doesn't mean that there's noone there to get them. There are other very sick characters, homicidal, suicidal, and spiteful. [[ASIN:B007IXWL2C Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br />I have come to a conclusion that the author has met a \\"Mr. Grey\\" in real life, was allowed into his inner world, and was inspired to write this trilogy, for which I am greatful.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about the Wool series, I read these books one at a time as they came out and I could not get enough.  As soon as Hugh Howey released the next book in the series I snatched it up and read it in no time.  The only issue I had was that I could not get enough of this incredible world Hugh so poignantly penned.  As luck would have it, the Wool Omnibus was released with all five books under one great cover!  Believe me, if you are new to Wool then this is great news for you!  It is very rare that I will rate a book but it is also very rare when a book this good comes along.  If you like the SciFi end of world (or is this the beginning?) type books, then get this book and read it now, you will not be disappointed....just be prepared to not put it down...it is simply unstoppable!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This is a great story of the depression and the drought.<br />A true Classic. Life as real as it gets.
0525478817|5.0|I started reading this book not knowing what it was going to be about and no real expectations other than others had said it was good. I really didn't know what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised at the book. It is now one of my favorites of all-time.<br />Books have always seemed to make me cry more than movies do. For me, people get way more emotional invested into books than movies because you get to see the thoughts behind their actions and not just their actions (at least in most books). This book was no exception.  The last few chapters I couldn't get through without an onslaught of tears. So if you're thinking of reading that in school, don't. I made the mistake of reading an intense book during school and it was almost a disaster. Unless you're okay with people seeing you cry over book, then go right ahead.<br />I've read some cancer books before this one and they weren't really up to par with this one. I may be reading the wrong books, but that's life. I had tried to read Before I Die by Jenny Downham but I just couldn't get into it like I did with this one.<br />To wrap all of that up, read the book. It's very good:)
B005J4TLN4|2.0|With some of the actors, and from the previews, I really wanted to like this one - and it is likely just me, as many seemed to really enjoy it, but I am glad I rented first as it just got a tad annoying after a while -- the \\"teeth\\" effect was pretty cool and that was about all that kept my interest as long as it did - just could not get into it and won't rent again.  So not a bad movie, but 2 stars means \\"did not like\\" -- and hadda admit, I did not ---- rent first before you purchase as I feel the trailer is better than the film.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|This one rockets from a solid-but-not outstanding first half to wrap up with an exceptional finale and moments of sheer brilliance.
B005K2Z5IA|5.0|It does what it says. Its high quality and is great protection for your kindle vie dropped it twice and my kindle is fine. A kindle is best held and read on its own. So buying a cover like this makes more sense than something like the dinner jacket. Which i also had. You can store your bus pass, money, headphones and charger in thing with your kindle and go about town. Given there will be a small bulge but i can live with that. I string a loop of para-cord under the flap, instantly turning it into a sling-pouch.
B0085LEU02|5.0|Fantastic album Patti struggle with nature and art is so on the mark.  It's fun to hear her change her voice for the song banga it reminded me of Gilda Radner back in the day.
034553154X|4.0|I per-ordered this based on the cover image alone (gorgeous!) but I sort of regret buying it...the art work is all top notch, but I think they picked some strange scenes. Do I really want Cersei's \\"walk of shame\\" on my wall for an entire month? Probably not. The \\"Lady Stoneheart\\" scene is beautiful and ominous, but also features a lot of hanging corpses...again, not sure I'd want this on my wall where other people - especially those not familiar with the series - might see it. Similar feelings about Daenerys in the house of the Undying, and the \\"Broken Vows\\" lovers (gorgeous, but provocative).<br />All and all a really beautiful calendar, but I feel like I need to hide it in a back corner of my house where children and the in-laws won't see it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I never read the books until this movie came out. I had heard about it, and dismissed the movie because of all the media hype. Lesson learned, never listen to the media.<br /><br />I watched JC once, on the airplane, and felt even days after, that I missed a lot because of the venue. I bought it, and watched in the comfort of my own home, and wow, did I ever miss a lot. Great story, fabulous graphics. And now NASA has confirmed magnetic portals on earth - so far just to the sun, but if there are portals to the sun, why not to other destinations too? Highly recommend if you are a science fiction fan, this has to be in your library.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much, I bought the books for my kindle, and started reading. How did I not read these so many years ago, maybe was too caught up in Pern, I don't know. Thoroughly pleased with both purchases.

B004XDYJRU|4.0|If you do a search for a clock radio app, this one comes up without much in the way of competition. There have been huge improvements in this app recently, and probable future changes will quickly make this post outdated. In the meantime the following comments that might be of consideration follow.<br /><br />The alarm settings can be found by pressing the bottom center menu button followed by selecting the settings option. Most of the options available are straightforward. At the time of this writing only one alarm could be set with the option of repeating on the days selected. The option of turning the alarm off or on was about the only one given.<br /><br />Unless the Auto-restart-player option is selected, the Kindle will only provide a beeping alarm, otherwise, the last stream you were listening to will be the one played. The radio volume set and once triggered by the alarm cannot be adjusted without exiting the program. The alarm does not cause Tunein to be the active program. If you want an alarm that is hard to shut off without volume control, this one fits the bill. If you want a snooze alarm, going through all the steps currently required to activate it might make it unnecessary.<br /><br />There currently is not an app that acts like a clock radio I am aware of. Tunein is the closest, and with the demands it has with the other features it offers, how the resources and priorities game is played is going to determine how fast and what is available.<br /><br />My vote for the first feature improvement at this time is a one button push snooze alarm for the clock radio.<br /><br />Being specific helps define goals. Please provide any comments you might have about Tunein feature improvements you might want.<br /><br />All the Best,<br />Rich

0439023521|4.0|Some books are character-driven, some are dialogue-driven, some are plot-driven. The Hunger Games is definitely the last of these... it's all about WHAT is happening, and the premise and details are just really interesting and well done. The characters are a little weak, and I guess it's because I'm an adult that I found the writing a tiny bit too junior, but I don't think the story really depended on those things. What stuck with me was the idea of it, and I raced through to find out how it would end.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this book a few months ago for my Kindle on a dare because some women in a now defunct book club I belonged to was as curious as I was about all the fuss over this book. Couldn't wait to read it knowing it would be cheap thrills but expected great writing/plot/character development/awesome dialogue and the \\"steamy\\" sexual encounters women seemed to be raving about.<br /><br />So I began to read the night I ordered it and started falling asleep after the first few pages. I chocked it up to a shaky start.<br /><br />I've since TRIED to read this book on at least 5 other occasions trying to get to a point in the book where I am not cringing because it is so cheesy, predictable, juvenile, badly written (if the heroine says 'oh crap!, 'holy cow' and its derivatives ONE more time....) that I never get there! I have no idea what page I've left off but I have given up. I leave reading this book so exasperated it is not pleasure at all. And sex scenes? Well I was trying to wait to get to one to see if THAT was what all the fuss was about but now I don't even care!<br /><br />Such drivel a bestseller? Who IS reading this book? I can only assume it is young women and presume that to be her audience. If you are a mature woman over 35, you're better off buying another book for your summer reading pleasure.<br /><br />A couple of my friends on the dare felt similarly--none of us got through it. I wanted a great \\"escape/fantasy book\\" but my goodness this sure isn't it. A big fat yawn and huge let down. The quality of the writing is a REAL issue. It is just THAT bad. I'm still scratching my head as to why this book is still topping Amazon's charts! And why it is now a series (???)<br /><br />I don't like to \\"hate\\" anything, that is why I gave it 2 stars.
014241493X|5.0|John Green never disappoints. Paper Towns is a phenomenal piece of literature. Inspiring, and entertaining, I would recommend everyone read it! Especially teenagers and young adults. It was great to read, and remains one of my favourite books.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey-Storey line is somewhat light on, however quite erotic. I hope next book in series has more substance.Characters in book are most interesting .Iam sure we all know a Christian

B0079K4WMG|3.0|There doesn't seem to be any shortage of end of the world films these days.  Add this Euro (Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and Scotland) collaboration to the mix.  Don't look for alien invaders from another galaxy or robotic killers or even interplanetary collisions however.<br /><br />Set in Glasgow, scientists have discovered that a group of people are, for some unknown reason, losing their sense of smell.  The disease, presumed to be viral, spreads quickly worldwide.  What is even more unusual is that just before the ability to smell ceases, the victims go through a psychological change.  In this case, uncontrollable grief along with incessant sobbing.  Once that period ends the ability to smell goes as well.<br /><br />Eva Green plays Susan, an epidemiologist who is working on the identification process.  Her apartment overlooks the back door of an upscale restaurant where Michael (Ewan McGregor) is the chef.  Both are coming off badly ended relationships, but of course manage to hook-up.  What do you expect, they're both great looking.  While their relationship becomes hotter, so does the virus.  One by one, new psychological symptoms arrive with increasingly devastating effects.  The movie is far from perfect as some of the scenes seem out of context.  For example, even without a sense of taste, I doubt I'd want to be ingesting soap and shaving cream just for a few bathtub chuckles.<br /><br />Although the movie has sadness about it and a bleak forecast, Susan and Michael's love story is both erotic and hopeful.  Certainly a thinking person's sci-fi.  Recommended.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc has little to offer in terms of extras.  The transfer has a 2.34:1 aspect ratio nearly the same as the original print and is of course 1080p.  While the picture isn't reference quality it is likely close to the original.  Several scenes appear to be stock newsreel footage in standard definition.  I believe this was shot with digital cameras.  Some scenes look a little dark but overall not a big deal.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It is very good.  There are no booming noises so expect a pretty quiet film.  So quiet in fact, I had to play it at a much higher level than I usually do.  The ambient noises (birds, kitchen workers, etc.) come across very cleanly.overall not a big deal.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It is very good.

B008BM9L72|3.0|my daughter calls these books \\" porn for housewives\\" - close description I thought after reading the trilogy. Escapism, x rated Mills and Boon, fifty shades of repetition. The storyline had potential to be far more deep and meaningful but didnt deliver. A quick read, glad I did it but  not on my list of favorites.

B007MDB71O|3.0|I rented John Carter in 2D on BluRay and viewed it on a 50\\" Plasma.  The special effects are at least as good as anything I've viewed on my set.  The green Martians and other creatures indeed look real.<br /><br />Although I had never read nor really known of the books, I realized beforehand that the story is a fantasy for adolescents. However, I was still a bit put off by the vague corniness of script and acting, and the loosely constructed fictional physics of the red planet.<br /><br />When my son is 8 years old or so, I imagine this will be just about his favorite movie ever.
0345803493|1.0|I read 50 shades of grey when my hubby got it from the library for me.<br /><br />In spite of the poor writing, I did enjoy it and decided to finish out the series.<br /><br />Finishing the second book was a chore due to the poor writing and so much sex that even sex was boring. How is that possible??????<br /><br />Anyway, upon coming to the conclusion of this book, I returned both 50 shades of darker AND freed to the library because I felt dumber for having read 50 shades darker.<br /><br />If you want to read a book about BDSM that is well written AND has a plot, try Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey.  I really enjoyed that trilogy.

B001QUTGS0|3.0|It is cheaper to buy the albums separately right now. This is overpriced for a movie soundtrack of MP3s which are typically shorter than other albums.
0375846735|1.0|I had the displeasure of reading this book twice. Once at the tender age of 9, then at 20. Why did I read a book I did not like twice, you may ask? Because I LOVED The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife. As I grew, I got to thinking maybe I had been unfair with the third one; maybe I was too young to understand it, maybe I hadn't paid attention, whatever the case could be. So I gave it a second chance and holy damn was it painful.<br /><br />The book is full of tired clich&eacute;s, plot devices, deus ex machina, corny dialogue, corny writing in general, terrible characterisation, horrid pacing, and the list goes on. To go in a little bit more detail:<br /><br />Firstly, one the things that most annoyed me was how Pullman utterly DESTROYED his formerly brilliant characters. Whatever happened to the strong-minded, willful, intelligent Lyra? In this book, she feels like a lame vehicle for the author to make a very poorly thought out metaphor, and a terribly written love interest. She just falls into being this one-dimensional, unintelligent, cowardly little girl! You get this tired impression that inside, she's just going \\"oh I hope Will can protect me, I'm so scared!\\", which is SO unlike the previous two books it makes my blood boil. I also felt the same for Mrs. Coulter; whatever happened to her? Where's the devious, machinating woman from the Golden Compass? I mean goddamnit.<br /><br />The author also has the balls to introduce something called an Intention Device, or some such, that can be used for LITERALLY ANYTHING but is instead meant TO BRING A CHARACTER FROM POINT A TO POINT B AND THEN PROMPTLY BREAK because he couldn't be assed to write himself out of his predictament. This is the most glaring deus ex machina in the story, but unfortunately not the only one. See the female angel that is used as AN EXPOSITION TOOL.<br /><br />The part with those godawful mulefa was so atrociously bad it makes me angry all over again just to remember it. It was boring. It was corny. It was lazy. It was so unlike the previous two books that, I swear to God, I honestly thought it had been written by a different person. It also felt like an incredibly long part, but then again any length of text with those things is too much. They are uninteresting, ridiculous, cheesy, and once again used to make some horribly contrived analogies to get the author's point across.<br /><br />The resolution to the Dust problem just SCREAMS of laziness. The love story was horrible, forced, contrived and painful to read (and NOT in the sense that it was actually \\"heart-wrenching\\", as some reviewers said). The villains were a one-note bore, ridiculous and one-dimensional, especially the priest who was in it for the evulz. I'm not even kidding, he meets some giant birds and they just know each other to be evil (the author wrote this into the book, I'm not even joking), and then the bird things promptly procceed to defecate on the mulefa houses while the priest takes a hike on one of them. You know what this subplot amounts to? Nothing. So do many others.<br /><br />You know what's actually heart wrenching? (spoilers for A Song of Ice and Fire, maybe, so be warned): \\"Jaime Lannister sends his regards\\". That is powerful, because you cared. This nauseating romance between Will and Lyra made me think(SPOILERS) \\"yes, please, separate these two, the world couldn't handle this much awkward and forced sappiness without self destructing out of shame\\".<br /><br />The writing itself just felt both forced and lazy. I distinctively remember one passage in which one of the two kids says that their atoms will meet each other when they die or some such. ARE YOU FOR REAL, PULLMAN? I mean seriously, if you're going with anti-theism, that's great, but own up to it and go all the way; don't force me to swallow this kind of crap.<br /><br />Finally, as for the religious content itself, criticism of anything is fine as long as it's done intelligently and with good arguments. This was the case in the first two books (especially The Golden Compass); in fact, I'd argue Book 1 is a great example of criticism done right. However, this feels like reading Ayn Rand, I kid you not. Plot and characters were cast aside in favor of making some horribly written and poorly thought out metaphors, there is forced exposition, there are strawmen everywhere... the only thing that was lacking was a bona fide author fillibuster, if I recall correctly, but I wouldn't be surprised if on a second reread I could find this book's \\"This is John Galt speaking.\\"<br /><br />So, to describe this book in one word: lazy. The plot was done lazily; so were the characterisation, the theological arguments, the pacing, the dialogue... it's a freaking mess, and it only gets worse as the book goes on.<br /><br />My recommendation is read it, because you should always see things for yourself. Hell, you might be one of the many who love this book, for some reason. However, see if you can read it for free first, then buy it if you like it. This is not worth the paper it's printed on, IMO.<br /><br />One final note: I don't mean to offend anybody who liked it, taste is taste. These are only my opinions, and although they are harsh, it's only because I consider this to be the worst book I've ever read given the series it's in. If it were a stand alone book, I'd give it 3 stars, but given that it takes an amazing story and rips it in a million pieces, it felt like betrayal. It left a bitter taste in my mouth. I felt offended reading it, like Pullman was saying \\"Yeah, see this cool story? Watch me butcher it while it screams in agony\\".<br /><br />Well, that's it, hope there are some kindred spirits out there to balance out the negative votes I'll get, hehe.s the case in the first two books (especially The Golden Compass); in fact, I'd argue Book 1 is a great example of criticism done right.

0785152458|2.0|Kick-Ass 2 by Mark Millar & John Romita is a very disappointing sequel to the highly original mini-series.  What changed?  The original series was so interesting due to its \\"realistic\\" depiction of what might happen if an average kid decided to be super-hero.  Somewhere in Kick-Ass 2, reality is severed (super teams are formed, villains run rampant), as we see characters act in a no-consequence environment.  As a result, there is little emotional resonance from the events that transpire, jarring as some attempt to be.  It's probably unsurprising, as it is impossible to shock the reader with violence after diving so deep in the first mini-series.<br /><br />JRJR's art is strong as always, though inconsistent coloring in issue 6 did stick out in a bad way.  The only \\"extras\\" are an introduction, and reprints of the variant covers.<br /><br />All in all, Kick-Ass 2 feels like a missed opportunity to expand upon a very unique and interesting concept.

B005LAIISA|2.0|I will not repeat what others said. The only one thing I really did NOT like was that there was way too much violence. Sure, I get the idea of pirates, but it was too much. Knifes? Fire weapon? And this is a movie for kids? I see some trend of violent movies - compare Cars and Cars2. Similar thing was done here.<br /><br />Except that - it was funny; however, I have a feeling the first two parts of Ice Age were the best.<br /><br />Go see it, but I would not spend 20 USD on DVD...

0143121006|3.0|This book was recently released to a lot of rave reviews. I read one such review in my local newspaper, so I put this book on reserve at the library. I'm glad I didn't buy it. I'd expected the \\"compulsively readable\\" true crime book described by reviewers.<br /><br />This one wasn't compulsively readable. I had to pick it up several times and ended up flipping to the final chapters to find out what really happened. The prose isn't awful, but it wasn't compelling either.<br /><br />A serious and constantly irritating aspect of this book, was the lack of a readable map, although the opening chapters describing the crime and the Peking of that era, constantly harped on specific locations. The only \\"map\\" is a highly stylized artist's drawing of - apparently - 1930's Peking, located as endpapers in the front and back of the book. This \\"map\\" is floridly colored, whimsically illustrated, full of difficult-to-read print, and apparently doesn't show such important locations as the oft-named street where the victim lived. Or anyway, if that information was there, I failed to locate it after several careful inspections.<br /><br />I assume the author was correct in describing the events, and I thought the explanation he offered at the end was believable. The most interesting part of the book was the description of where the main players in the story, ended up during and after the Japanese invasion. I found it notable that Pamela Werner's father, old and iconoclastic, survived the hardships of a Japanese internment camp unbroken while younger people perished or emerged as wrecks.<br /><br />As a crime story, it was a brutal tawdry tale. What happened to the victim was horrible, and shouldn't have been done, and the killers deserved to be caught and punished although they weren't. However, the world soon became ensnarled in warfare that brought such widespread horror and destruction, that it's almost a surprise that anyone resurrected this story at all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, its incredibly addicting. It's a challenge but not so hard that you give up. I strongly reccomend this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is a great time waster. I tend to get very addicted to this game. I highly reccomend this for any age group
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just when you think you've found a mindless app to pass the time, along comes Flow Free!  It's not as mindless as you may think, starts out with simple puzzles and works its way up building on strategy to get you to the next level.  Great app, a hoot to play on my Kindle Fire.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I enjoy platform games very much,  and bought this for that reason. Paper monsters follows the quest of a cardboard thing who is the only one who can save the land from other monsters (I'm not sure that's entirely correct, for the voice in the beginning is very hard to understand) . so the story is pretty simple and easy to follow.<br />I think the graphics are good because they clearly match the theme and use bright vibrant Colorado that adds a fun element.<br />While the controlls are sometimes difficult to use (the d-pad in particular) they will not disprove your enjoyment of this title.<br />Along with the main adventure there are two mini games, which sadly I have not yet played.<br />All in all, its a good game, and is well worth the 99 cents. If you are a person that loves classic platform games like Mario or megaman, you will find paper monsters to be very very fun. But,  those of you that like darker games with complex stories, you might not enjoy this as much.<br />Again,  this game is fun and quirky, and is suitably for someone of any age.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Great starting point for gaining more insight into how introverts and extraverts compare/contrast. This book was a starting point for me to learn even more. As an introvert and psuedo extravert I found this book to be a little heavy on the case study snippets and lacking research but overall an interesting and informative book. I wish more leaders in industry would read this.
B003Y5H574|4.0|CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE is a dynamic and heartfelt comedy--a comedy with real laugh-out-loud moments and scenes where the viewers' heads are nodding because we've all felt the way the characters on screen are feeling.  It's warm, readily identifiable, poignant, substantially charming, and for the most part, totally believable.  It holds together and flows remarkably well--with an hysterical scene when four men go rogue--until it unravels during a surreal and bizarre junior high graduation.  And the air comes out of the balloon with a gaseous hiss, an ending this outstanding comedy doesn't deserve.<br /><br />Emily and Cal (Julianne Moore and Steve Carell) have been married over twenty years and look and act the part--until Emily announces she wants a divorce, as she's had an affair with a coworker (Kevin Bacon).  Stunned and confused, Cal is suddenly a middle-aged single man, practically wearing the 'D' word on his brow as he attends the local watering hole on a nightly basis, catching the attention of Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a suave babe magnet who effortlessly picks up any woman he wants, with no strings attached.  Jacob becomes Cal's wing man, teaching him how to dress, how to act, and particularly how to interact.  Although not nearly as successful as Jacob, Cal does periodically \\"score\\", particularly with perky Kate (Marisa Tomei), who, unbeknownst to both of them, is the teacher of Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo).  Yet despite his conquests Cal feels strangely empty, and still drawn to Emily.  Meanwhile Robbie has a crush on Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), the babysitter, and if that's not complicated enough Jessica has a crush on Cal.  And the icing on this neopolitan cake is when ladies' man Jacob falls head over heels for Emily and Cal's elder daughter Hannah (Emma Stone); and the stage is set for some crazy, stupid comedy.<br /><br />Character actor John Caroll Lynch rounds out the main players as Jessica's father, with Lynch, Bacon, Gosling, and Carell in a tag team foursome that had me donkey braying with glee.  It's all grand fun until Robbie, his eighth grade class valedictorian, gives a grim, existential speech at junior high graduation, with Cal interrupting to wax philosophical on true love, with me squirming uncomfortably, wondering if screenwriter Dan Fogelman had suddenly lapsed into a Jack Daniels funk.  The only persons who might enjoy this scene are therapists, and based on the bizarre utterings there's plenty of work to be done here.  Thus CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE is good, often very good, in spite of an almost fatal ending.  I suggest you have some Jack yourself before tackling it.<br />--D.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|This was so useful for understanding how to publish a book on Amazon.  Super easy to understand and great step by step instructions.
0439023513|2.0|OK so I really enjoyed book 1, kinda enjoyed book 2 and pretty much didn't like book 3.  It all went downhill from book 1!  What happened?  A great story line with wonderful characters in book 1 turned into a rather boring and uninteresting book in Mockingjay.  Way too much psychobabble and emotional trauma with the main characters.  Not a fun read at all, struggled to finish it.  Disappointing end to the triology.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I started watching Supernatural on Netflix beginning with season 1.  I'm now on episode 6 of season 5 and I'll be distraught when I've finished watching all available shows.  I like that along with the drama that humor is mixed in.  So far my favorite episode is when Dean catches a \\"fear\\" virus and is afraid of everything from a tiny dog to a kitten.  I still laugh about it.  While many think this show is for teens, I'm over 50 and am thoroughly enjoying the series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of the best bible apps out there, it's the one I consistently use.  Many different translations/versions available and easy to navigate.  Good tech support and the publisher is constantly improving.
B005P9SLES|5.0|This program being the name of an older series is really good.  The people in it do a good job and every week it's just a interesting as the last week.  I buy the complete seasons because most good series don't last on TV, and that way I can go back when nothing else is on and watch it again.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I purchased this set to replace my abused and edge melted nylon kitchen utensils. These are high quality utensils and have already stood up to my cooking punishment. They clean up easily and are dishwasher safe. It is kind of cool how they are designed to sit off of the counter.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about this set is the brightly colored handles, but that is just a matter of personal preference. They all fit in one drawer next to my stove and they are thin enough for eggs while still being sturdy.<br /><br />An excellent buy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think that this is a GREAT app. It is probably pointless and a time waster, but if you are an app fanatic like me, you will enjoy it. It has never become pixely or not responded too. If you like brain benders or brain games you will enjoy this app a lot.It is also available for Apple electronics.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is very fun but i dont like some things. i would like the &quot;virtual pad&quot; to not go invisible when not touched for a certain time. The download takes a while but this game is very fun. just needs a few changes. definately worth 7.00 just needs an update.
B002DMJL9E|2.0|I bought this movie only cause its a classic! but the restoration to blu ray format, it really sucks, the image its the same as a dvd, and the sound its the same as all old movies of 30 years, they didt do nothing to make it better.<br /><br />So, its only for my collection, but i do not recommend it on blu ray<br /><br />sorry!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Super cute. the idea is like wheres my water. but there is a lot difrent. i think they worked out a lot of issue and made this
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This movie is one of the funnier movies I have ever seen.  From unexpected outbursts and actions to clever plays on animal life, it will NOT DISAPPOINT.  Take some time to watch this movie. It is quite short as well, so don't let time keep you away from it.
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|Depp used to be my ideal man -- after seeing the Rum Diary -- one of the worst films ever -- I couldn't help thinking about what a dupe he played.  There was the ear to ear grin that made him look like an idiot -- I believe he is trying to hide the fact that he has had a face lift (tragic) and his character was such a simpleton.  There was no basis for the romance that he supposedly had and guess had to marry this girl after her brutal gang rape by the natives.  I felt embarrassed for Depp watching this clinker.<br /><br />I'm editing my review because I forgot to mention a very important fact.  Before Depp started work on \\"Fear and Loathing,\\" he spent a month living in Hunter's basement so he could be around Hunter to absorb his quirks and mannerisms.  While Depp was rummaging around in his basement, he found a first draft of \\"Rum Diary.\\"  It was never never finished while Hunter was alive.  Depp insisted that he wanted to do the story so it wasn't even written by Hunter.  While watching the film, I noticed that Depp acted in much the same way he did in \\"Fear and Loathing.\\"  My point is, don't blame Hunter's writing for this disaster.  It was Depp and whoever he hired to turn it into a screenplay.

1469984202|5.0|Are you dying for a science fiction storyline with believable human characters, where the outcomes are not predictable and the science is sound? If you like Jack McDevitt's approach- where ordinary people act in extraordinary settings- you will love these books. So refreshing to read some solid science fiction and not be weighed down with fantasy overtones and five million alien species. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.

It adjusts from every angle, so you can get the perfect setup.

B008FQ0S1W|5.0|...manages to 'sing my life.'  Has anyone else out there found that he does the same for you?<br /><br />White Light is a total club song, and by all rights he should have a huge club hit on his hands as the remixes are fabulous.  The lyrics are universal, life affirming, and trumpet rejuvenation and renewal at any point in life for all of us.<br /><br />I'm not sure, but the first few lyrics may be about Amy Winehouse, which is touching.  George has come back from the brink sounding better and stronger than ever, and White Light is the perfect song to celebrate.
B00846REIS|5.0|I should entitle this Better Than 50 Shades, but I don't want to compare them.  Because there is no comparison.  There is no bdsm in this book.  There is character development in this book.  This book is hot!  But I know both Bared to You and 50 Shades are on the bestseller list, and aimed at the same demographic.  I hated one (found it difficult to finish, the writing and character development was so poor) and one I have read multiple times, and will probably read more and more before the next book is out.<br /><br />I love the story.  Eva is a believable recent graduate, and the fact that she is wealthy in her own right is great - she isn't bowled over by his wealth.  I am really looking forward to the next book.  I hated 50 Shades - I read this one 4 times in one weekend.  Love, love, love it!<br /><br />Please don't give up when near the beginning, the female protaginist describes the male protaginist as having a face \\"that would make a sculptor weep\\"  That is just too cheasy, but I didn't see a repeat.  I was really afraid when I read that that this was going in the same direction as 50 Shades.  Thankfully it didn't.  I loved this book, and didn't find any of the scenes so kinky I couldn't relate.  Great story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great battery widget. It's very informative of battery use and time remaining. Very accurate on my Droid 3 after the widget calibration. 5 stars, great job.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book could NOT have gone to an editor.  I cannot believe it made it through the editorial process.  I read it, believing that since it was at the top of the NYT bestseller list, it had to be good.  But the female protaginist is too stupid and too weak to live.  And the male protaginist is not even a little sympathetic.  I know there is, with some women, a rescue fantasy, but this is ridiculous.  If my husband reacted the way the male protaginist reacted when he found out he was to be a father, I think I would have smothered him in his sleep.  The first book ended with the female kicking the male to the curb - that would have been okay, but then she took him back (I don't consider that a spoiler, because there are two more books!)I am embarrased that these books, so poorly written and so NOT HOT, made it to the top of the bestseller list.

The quest to Alaska to release death and make it back to save the Roman camp, meeting many intresting things along the way. This book is funny and just plain entertaining.
B008DYZKQE|2.0|I thought this would be a fun book to read to my<br />6-year old grandaughter.  Very disappointed in the<br />book; it seemed like the author cut it way too short<br />to be interesting or fun.  The ending was really a drag .... my 6 year old said, \\"what the heck\\".  Don't waste your time or money on this one.

B007YOC4RW|5.0|This Blues CD is the best I have heard in years. It has a 1970's sound of talent that is not around much these days. That is a combination of superior vocals, HOT GUTAR LICKS, and down to earth messages in the songs. Good for the soul, heart, and mind. This is how a rockin blues is done , when done at the highest level of achivement. I hope I can make this show, It will be worth it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Been playing this game for 4 days now and I am having a blast!!  There is a ton of stuff to do and the energy system doesn't seem to run out in mere minutes like most games of this sort.  The graphics and sound are nicely done as well.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Overall this film is excellent! I had never seen the latest version of this show before. I am used to watching the 10th anniversary edition which is also good but this one is better. The only downfall is Nick Jonas as Marius. He is more of a pop singer and he does not do well at all with the opera. His voice just doesn't match up to any of the others. I think he was just in it to bring in his fans. :-/ Overall It's really good though!

B0024FADDI|3.0|The three stars were generous and were intended for the movie as a whole. And this coming from a diehard fan. I love the evil dead series and had to have this. I was sadly mistaken. If you want to buy this movie look for a different edition.<br /><br />The good: \\"Digitally remastered\\" and adds to the quality. Less grainy<br /><br />The bad: \\"Digitally remastered\\" lol. Trust me its not worth it. Yes, this movie was intended to come with an order of extra cheese, that's what makes it so good. However, this edition takes it over the top. I watched it once and couldn't stand watching it again until I got an old version. Why? It's simple. When this movie was created it was done so at a time when a director could hide a couple bad special effects within the poor picture quality. It was not intended to be remastered. A couple examples would be the little ashes. The look like a bunch of guys running around in front of a big screen (which they probably were lol) and when one of em holds up a nail for big ash to step on you can very clearly see his foot come down behind it. Example #2 \\"two headed ash\\" or in this version one ash standing in front of a video of another ash. It's not even remotely done well it looks like a video someone wouldve made for YouTube. trust me people save yourselves the \\"seriously did that just happen\\" moments and hold onto your old untouched versions while you still can and always remember \\"Shop smart. Shop S-Mart\\"

B0042EJD8A|3.0|Not a review because I haven't watched it yet (so my 3 stars was a bit of a fib) because I can't find out if it has Closed Captioning. I'm hearing impaired and can only watch movies at home that have CC.<br /><br />Does anyone know? (Netflix and Amazon don't say it's CC but I've had other movies from them that neglected to say it was CC and actually were)<br /><br />I hope this 'review' isn't deleted by Amazon because it's a real dilemma for people who are hearing impaired.<br />Thank you if you can tell me and if it does have CC then I'll come back and review it.
B00486070K|1.0|Yikes! I just went to the Apple store to return this product, which had failed on me.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that I can go through the Bible in a year and it is all set up for me (or even less e.g., 60 or 90 days), and it is easy to use. What is really nice is that I can use the speech option and have it read aloud to me. I use this sometimes when I want to go through the reading again and it is easier to listen either meditatively, or while I am doing something mundane, like the dishes.

B007X4ECLY|3.0|The prison takeover film has been a Hollywood staple for decades and Lockout runs with the formula with the only real snippet of originality being that the prison is set in space.  It is the year 2079, and CIA agent Marion Snow (Pearce) is framed for the murder of another agent who was investigating stolen government secrets.  Snow is sentenced to 30 years in prison at MS One, a maximum security prison set on a floating space satellite where prisoners are kept in a cryogenic stasis.<br /><br />Before his sentence can be carried out, however, Snow is given a chance at a reprieve.  The prisoners have broken out aboard MS One and have taken several people hostage, including Emilie, the daughter of the President, who was on the satellite on a humanitarian mission investigating the well-being of the prisoners.  Snow is initially reluctant to take on the mission until he learns that Mace, the man he gave the briefcase containing information that could clear him, is aboard the prison as well.  More determined to find the case rather than rescue Emilie, Snow sneaks onto the vessel to find it overrun with the most dangerous prisoners on the planet, led by Alex, and his psychotic kill-crazy brother Hydell.<br /><br />The entire pretext for the prison breakout is incredibly flimsy...First the daughter of the President going into such a dangerous location with little more than a couple of Secret Service agents.  Then the whole idea of the warden unfreezing perhaps the most mentally unhinged prisoner out of some 500 total is ludicrous.  It would be like someone going to Corcoran Prison in California to check on prisoners and the warden wheels out Charlie Manson.  And of course one of the Secret Service agents are dumb enough to sneak a gun into the interview room even though they were supposed to check all weapons.  Now remember, this is supposed to be 67 years in the future...So what, they stopped using metal detectors and Backscatter X-ray machines in 2079 and now just take guys words that they are unarmed?  Right...<br /><br />I've been a fan of Guy Pearce ever since Ravenous and have always enjoyed his performances, but he seems to be trying to channel a combination of Snake Plisken from Escape from New York and John McClane from Die Hard with his performance.  He forces one bad one-liner after another and ends up being more of a parody of action heroes than an actual action hero.  Thankfully Pearce is bailed out by a solid supporting cast including Maggie Grace as Emilie, and Peter Stromare as Langral, the head of the Secret Service.<br /><br />The action in Lockout is wildly inconsistent.  On one hand the prison has an automated defense system of Death Star like gun turrets that are able to repel the aircraft of security forces that Langral sends in to re-take the prison.  On the other hand, Snow is able to escape at least a half dozen times from prisoners just by running through a door and closing it behind him.  Why is it he seems to be able to operate all the doors and the prisoners can't?  Lockout is a futuristic film but it didn't have the budget ($20 million) to truly pull off a futuristic look.  This unrated edition amps up the violence a little bit but this could still really pass for a PG-13 film.<br /><br />Ultimately, Lockout is a middle of the road actioner that provides a mild diversion but is completely forgettable.ys words that they are unarmed?

B005LAIH5O|3.0|Well if you're one of those glass half full type of people you can look at Wrath of the Titans from the standpoint that at least it's better than Clash of the Titans (2010) although that might not be saying much since that film didn't exactly set the bar too high.  Without having much of a reputation to live up to, Director Jonathan Liebesman (Battlefield: Los Angeles) is free to pretty much free to indulge himself and go crazy and largely does.  Wrath becomes almost like a live-action version of the popular videogame series God of War with battles against mammoth boss creatures like a Chimera, Cyclops, the Minotaur, and the giant, flaming titan Kronos.  The problem is that God of War has a log more depth of story and character than Wrath of the Titans could ever dream of having.<br /><br />Set 10 years after the previous film, Perseus (Worthington) is living a simple life as a fisherman with his ten year-old son, Helius.  He is visited by his father Zeus (Neeson) who warns Perseus that because people no longer than believe in the Gods, the  prison of Tarterus in the underworld is beginning to crumble and threatens to unleash its denizens on the world.  Perseus has no interest in becoming in the affairs of the Gods, however.  Zeus meets with his brothers Hades (Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), as well has his son Ares (Edgar Ramirez), in order to rebuild the prison.  However, he is betrayed by both Ares and Hades who plan to revive the great titan Kronos.<br /><br />The reluctant Perseus finds himself drawn into the fray when a Chimera attacks his village and a dying Poseidon tells him Zeus is being held captive in the underworld.  Poseidon must go on a quest to locate Zeus' Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidon's Trident, to form the Spear of Triam, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos.  Perseus is joined by Agenor, the demigod son of Poseidon, and Queen Andromeda, as they journey into the heart of Hades realm to rescue Zeus.  Wow that even sounds like the plot of a video game.<br /><br />The main problem with Wrath of the Titans is that it doesn't have a captivating villain to carry the action.

B0068LYEHA|4.0|I saw this book mentioned on Slate.com and just had to buy it.  I was not disappointed.  Moran's writing is raunchy, hilarious, and very relevant to the feminist discussions that are happening in 2012.
B00785P2QC|4.0|AMUSING at first slightly monotonous pretty sure in order to continue playing will have to buy investor bucks or whatever but none the less its not a bad wayto pass the time. slightly addicting.
0345803493|5.0|This book was my favorite in the trilogy.  It was very easy to read and I think it really enlightened me that there are all kinds of people in this world.  It was very sensual and provacitive.  The whole series is a must read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have finished all three books...it was a good read. Not as bad as all the shows are saying it is.
0345803507|4.0|This series was really interesting.  I didn't realalize that I could get so involved in reading again.  The ending to the series was not quite what I expected but every good series should keep you interested right until the end and this one did.
B005HJU7HA|3.0|I got tired of trying to track down free copies of each of the story collections (and of their typos), so I bought this.  It is an improvement, but paging through chapters doesn't work and there are still typos.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We bought Kindles for our kids birthdays. One wanted Where's My Perry? but it's on all our systems. We're all playing it now.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I like a good story. In recent years, storytelling in movies seems to become a dying art.Like our culture is too busy to deal with a mature plot and a good story.Not so in Batman. The plot is layered and each character gets an interesting back story.<br /><br />You don't have to have seen the last movie with the Joker to get what is going on because they do flashbacks. But it helps if you saw the very first Batman. It is three hours long  and I noticed most of the kids and some tweens looked either very scared  or really bored and miserable. Although one very little boy who looked about 6 or 7 seemed to be having a blast.<br /><br />Their are so many amazing actors in this movie, but I will only highlight two.<br />Watching Joseph Gordon Levitt in  a juicy meaty role as a young but tough beat cop was a joy for me. I used to love him in different Disney movies when I was a kid. Even then you could tell he was more than just a cute kid.<br /><br />The scene in which Batman ends up in a pit like prison was beyond tedious. It was forty five minutes to a hour of him trying trying to get out of there. It should of been 15 20 minutes tops. Also, I didn't need to see Batman getting his vertebrae cracked back into place. I know it is a part of life, and I am too sensitive but, it was freaky for me and for the eleven year olds sitting next to me. Also too much time of Batman moping around in the beginning.<br /><br />Loved Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, she usually plays the same goody goody character over and over again. Although they should stop making her wear super red lipstick. It is not her color. There was no cheese to her part whatsoever, unlike some of the previous cat woman. There are no cats hanging around whatsoever, she acts like your typical tempermental cat. It was nice to see her branch and try something else. The way she speaks and all that reminds me of a certain busty red head on Mad Men
B003N0XDT4|3.0|I had to leave a review after going through a bit of a quagmire today with this product.  I've had it for about 3 weeks now and I'd like to say that it does make a difference in the sound quality of my music, however I use it predominantly with my computer.  So please bear this in mind, and listen to me very CLEARLY when I say that this is NOT a good product for portable devices such as PSPs or iPods.<br /><br />The reason being is that up until today I had been using this device through the audio jack connection as opposed to the USB.  I was was just easier for me given the layout of my computer, but needless to say that part of the device *SHOULD* be an essential component, and today it went \\"kaput.\\"  The headphone jack for INPUT began causing serious feedback and static in the left side of my headphone (I tried 2 different pairs), and I made sure it was the device.  Then I went ahead and reset the device, still the exact same horrible problem.<br /><br />Only after I switched the input from the headphone jack to USB did things return to normal.  Apparently this is a VERY common problem with this device, so it would be my advice to anyone considering it that they only be using it with their computer.  If you use it with an iPod you will not be happy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing game its rocks! everyone should get this game if you don't already have it and you are reading this get it now
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After having read all of the reviews on Amazon, I still decided to purchase and read Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One.  I felt compelled since so many copies had been sold.  After starting the book, which I find to be a pretty easy read, I realized it is not what I was expecting.  I did not realize the scenes would involve so much sadomasochism.  I agree with other reviewers in that the book is not realistic whatsoever - but no one can really complain since it is fiction.  I ended up getting bored with the book about 70% of the way through it and stopped reading it.  I wouldn't waste your time - there are several other good books out there right now.
030758836X|4.0|An awesome book.  Each page brought new revelations and questions. I see a lot of people were put off by the ending, but I think the ending fits well with the story ... Won't say anything else to spoil it, but I will say this was a great read!!
0061900664|5.0|I bought this book for my 20 month old son and I love it. I know it is hard for him to understand and also foe me to explain but he loved the book and the pictures. Very satisfy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm greatly enjoying this app. It was introduced to me by a coworker and i was instantly hooked. I would definitely recommend this to others.
B008MEM24S|3.0|It would probably be more enjoyable if I didn't start with where's my water (one of my favorites) It is really cute for kids though. My daughters like it a lot, because they watch the Tv show.
1439127700|3.0|So the President's Club intrigued me because it offers a chance to see how former President's interact with their successors.  What I liked was that it showed us the view of a rare world where men of immense power still wield it after leaving office.  The first part of the book was very interesting because it showed us how each man interacts with his successors.  What I don't like is that it morphs from being a hard hitting history of the evolution of presidential power to being a giddy joy ride about why president's are so cool.  I think the story lost it's edge once it hit the Nixon years.<br /><br />Hardly any mention is made of LBJ after he left office, the same holds true for Ronald Regan. (Does anyone remember the controversy about him getting $2 million for a speech?) The end of the book is very uneven and really loses focus.  Some may disagree but I think this is a book with some serious shortcomings.
0385339100|5.0|I think I got lucky when I picked this book up the read.  IT was my first Grisham book and my most absolute favorite.  IT is the best.<br /><br />From the get go, the missing money, the murder, and mystery, made for a gripping tale. I especially love the twist in the end.  I am waiting for the sequel that absolutely has to come from this.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Not long ago,  I played the regular DVD of SWL and was reminded how amazing the concert was.  Especially since I got to see the show live myself.  My only disappointment was the quality of the video now on the flat screen.  But now, that issue has been solved to with the Blu-ray release of Secret World Live.  It's has all the great songs from the original concert DVD, remastered in phenomenal HD sound;  and,  the video has been remastered from the original 16mm film to blu-ray quality.  Now, it's not going to be eye popping HD, but it's the best transfer of film to HD that I've seen.  You also get a bonus concert footage of  \\"Red Rain\\"  (which was on the concert CD... but not the DVD).<br /><br />This is a must have for any PG fan..<br /><br />Now... Will they do the same for POV?
B005K2YRVG|5.0|Perfect protection for my kindle.  I'm very glad I bought it, though I just bought a case I can use while I'm reading on the kindle.  I still feel this one is perfect for storage because it cushions my kindle and protects it from dust better than the \\"reader\\" case.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool game......great for kids. they all love it. I reccomend. to everyone. get this game. you wont regret it. great time killer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super super super fun!!I love this game it is really. addicting. you never want to stop playing get this game
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah McLachlan has been consistently one of my favorite musicians, and this is by far her best album.  Many of these songs are still played on the radio and in movies even though the album is from 1998.  If you're new to McLachlan or just want to round out your collection, I highly recommend every song on this greatest hits album.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is awesome you may have tom wait 3 hour for grilled cheese but it gives tons of plates
B008MEM24S|5.0|I have to admit: the kids are asleep and I can't stop playing.  This is a must buy for all ages!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I thought this was a great movie. Awsome plot and great actors. Only complaint and its a big one was the shaky camera. It was so bad that I almost got up and walked out of the theater. Please stop making movies like this. Over the years cameras have evolved to help home movies stop that sick to the stomach feeling because of the skaky screen, why does hollywood think its a good idea to film movies this way now?
B0082LUEW8|5.0|The best Metal album released so far in 2012. I can't get it out of my CD Player. Hope they do a headline tour this year.
B001EVNMTK|5.0|These are sadly hard to find in any store.  But I got em here and my husband uses it everyday!
B004AFFZNI|4.0|This is what you need to protect the camera lens while on the desk downloading videos ect due to the exposed lens just waiting to be scratched.It may be used in dry/protected areas but for rain or dirt you need the dry OEM case.I am using this case also as a test unit to add a 37 mm step up ring [to 52mm] so that I can add filters [ cpl/uvA] It seems that the lens outside dimension is 37 mm so even though the lens is not threaded it should be possible to lightly file out the 37 mm ring to fit flush on the case and be carefully glued down.Then a 52 mm filter should fit.It needs 7 mm's to clear the protruding lens.It may take a second 37 mm ring to get the clearance[ Installed first].A cheap 37mm uva with the glass removed should work.Good luck.<br /><br />Just a follow up, this worked well,no filing was necessary it fit on the front ring and raised the ring up to the proper height.Now I am currently upgrading the Original dry case to accept the 52mm filters.No vignetting on the corners. Pro should add a  thread ring to the lens to allow filters.Seems doable to me.
B005ZUR724|4.0|Very Wow like play lots of fun and EZ to play. tons of pll to play/quest/pvp with and different severs.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard about this series through my brother, and I'm so glad I did! I can't wait to read more of Mr. Howey's incredible stories!
B003YCI1O8|5.0|This is still an awesome film years later. The blu-ray is outstanding, picture and soundwise. I've watched this movie 4 times since I bought the blu-ray and it's always entertaining as ever! I used to own it on dvd and the picture quality was below par, this brings it into a new light, just go for it!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Was it entertaining? Yes. Was it the best book ever written? No. Will I read the next in the series? Not immediately, but yes. I like the idea behind it and I enjoy young adult literature in general. It had good character development without excessively long descriptions of clothing, scenery, or demeanor. I prefer to let my imagination fill in the blanks and let the plot move forward naturally.  Occasionally, I felt like the characters did things that were \\"out-of-character\\" or that were jarring in regards to what I could accept as plausible, but for the most part I enjoyed the book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great app. I use it anytime, not just for sleep. Very peaceful and comforting. Drowns out noise and is great for meditating.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|You've got to read this book. It has so many bits of wisdom. It made me laugh, it made me cry. It is not often that a book brings out those emotions in me. Please try and read this book this summer, you will love it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|You get what you pay for. Nothing really fancy. Has some neat mini games that you can play to waste time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! I even go back and play the puzzles I've already solved! Anxiously waiting for more levels!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book hooked me from the first page. The chsracters were well developed and the plot kept my attention until the very end. I was sad to get to the last page!
B003274QH6|4.0|With Breaking Bad currently airing the first half of its final season, I obviously arrived late to the party having just finished the first and second season. Until recently all I knew about the show was that it involved meth, starred Bryan Cranston, and was highly acclaimed. I don't watch too many television shows, but I questioned how a channel like AMC would be able to pull off this kind of material effectively. As you likely know, these questions are unwarranted. It's difficult to review the seven episodes that make up the first season without taking the brilliant second season that followed it into account. I believe this is why the first season is held in such high regard now and I think the reviews tend to reflect one's opinion of the show as a whole rather than this specific group of episodes. Because it's the first season and it was cut short by the writer's strike (from nine to seven episodes), the first season of Breaking Bad isn't as compelling as the season that followed it. This is not due to lower production values or weaker writing, merely the amount of exposition it takes to set up a series and the way Breaking Bad carefully establishes its characters. Perhaps this is biased itself as I'm judging this season based on how great the following season was. However, in regards to these seven episodes; the first three intrigued me, the fourth and fifth served as appropriate dramatic segues, and the final two episodes are nothing short of astounding. The show is undeniably a masterwork, but the first season sets up the masterpiece; it isn't one itself.<br /><br />At this point it seems superfluous to provide a synopsis, but it helps provide context. Walter White (Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher, with a second job at a car wash, living with his pregnant wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and their disabled son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). Shortly after his 50th birthday he's diagnosed with stage-three terminal lung cancer. With no health insurance and stress piling up, he keeps his diagnosis secret from his family. With the financial burden weighing on him, Walt begins looking for a way to make money when his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris) mentions how lucrative cooking meth can be. By chance, Walt notices Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), a former student of his, sneaking out of a house that Hank has busted. Walt's extensive knowledge of chemistry makes him able to cook highly potent meth and he blackmails Jesse into assisting him in the cooking and distribution. Shortly into Walt's newfound career, things go awry. I should add; this all happens in the pilot episode, which works like a self-contained movie. It's an impressive introduction.<br /><br />The second episode amps up the excitement with a shocking story arc that comes to a dramatic conclusion in the third episode. The fourth and fifth episodes are, as I mentioned, dramatic segues that put the focus on the characters and give them the depth necessary for us to start to care about them. These episodes are the least compelling, but they provide some of the most powerful dramatic moments of the season. The sixth episode debuts bald Walter, the look of the character that has become iconic as well as introducing Tuco (Raymond Cruz), the psychotic and powerful drug distributor with the power to lead Walter and Jesse to a big payday.<br /><br />The last two episodes are so intensely well-written and well-acted they immediately elevate the series. Each episode seems to improve upon the previous one and every creative decision that goes into forming the framework of the show is a success. A lot happens in only seven episodes, and every new character, every new conflict, seems inspired. The season ends on a high-note, opting to point the series in an intriguing direction rather than ending on a cheap cliffhanger. There's a real confidence in the direction of this series and the way it is put together.<br /><br />If the first season is slightly less than perfect, it's only because of necessary exposition. Every event here provides the catalyst for the rest of the series. Every episode of season one gets more intriguing and suspenseful; with season two, it only gets better.<br /><br />So what makes it so good? Well, you never get the impression that you're watching a television show. The cinematography, the pacing, the acting, the dialogue, the look, the feel of the show make Breaking Bad simply feel like a long movie. Bryan Cranston is a phenomenal actor who finally got people to take notice with this role and had this been a movie his work would be Oscar worthy. Aaron Paul also gives a terrific performance, one that takes a few episodes to grow on you and the love-hate chemistry he shares with Cranston is palpable.<br /><br />AMC is not HBO and there are FCC regulations, yet nothing about the content of the show ever feels restrained. There's violence, language, and sex; yet it's done tastefully and it works. This whole review is ultimately superfluous as I'm sure anyone reading it has already started watching the series. However, I must add to the pile of acclaim; this is one of the best shows on television and the first season is a special and unique introduction to it. Friends of mine had tried to convince me to watch this show for some time and I put it off. Don't make the same mistake. This show is almost as addictive as the drug it's based around and, similarly, it only gets more addictive the further in you go.
B00632HWOG|5.0|it is the perfect app 4kindels its good I Allways get my Emil right on time and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I had the free version and it's worth the small price to pay for the ad free on I think that they put a good mix of new and familiar characters in the game. The levels are interesting and challenging. e.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|loved it Tracey Honolulu can't. stay away from this game.There is nothing close to this out there. Tiny Village.been there came back.
0345803493|5.0|Love this book beyond words, and was deliever before the date exspected! I love the fast shipping and I finished the book a few days after I got it. I am not ordering book number three for my flight to TN!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|entertaining. wish games came with a little instruction. I play this game on my kindle when I'm bored and it keeps me entertained
B008GXHOFW|2.0|While the game looks great, there are too many hitches to make price of entry seem worth it. The draw distance in the open world is one thing, I understand that it must be a challenge to get everything to draw in correctly when running on a mobile platform and no one wants to line their city with a ton of fog. But the poor frame rate to the point of the game crashing the Kindle is just sad. I was able to play 1.5 missions before the game crashed. And near the latter half of that second mission I was struggling to get Spidey to go where I wanted him to go because the framerate dropped so bad.<br /><br />If a patch can be released to get the game up to a solid speed the entire time, I'd fully recommend it. Until then, unless you just have a huge itch to play a Spider-Man game on the go, stick with the console release of The Amazing Spider-Man.
B0086700CM|5.0|super fun game recommended100%!!!! I haven't come across any issues and have gotten other friends and family hooked. not one complaint so far.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|What can I say? I couldn't resist buying this book even with so-so reviews. Its all I've heard about for weeks, so I took the plunge. Am I sorry? No. Would I buy the second in the series? Absolutley not..but I would read it, if it were a freebie.<br />It's not a bad story, infact it was pretty enjoyable to read something light.. even with the adult content. There is no real depth to this story though. I'd compare it to juicy gossip, fun to listen to but after you hear the same thing over and over its not so interesting.<br />As stated in many reviews, some words and phrases were over used to the annoying point.<br />My advice, if you can borrow it, read it just to say you did. If you have to spend hard earned cash, leave it alone. You are not missing anything great.
