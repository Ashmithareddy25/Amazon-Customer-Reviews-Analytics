B00006LHYC|5.0|kills me it's her only english speaking album.  makes me wish I studied French harder in high school or really learned Spanish way back when I was involved with my South American amour 20 plus years ago...    one day Pausini will do another album in English I hope and suspect, but until then, let it suffice to say that if you like pop romantic melodies and lyrics this is as good as it gets...    What prompted me to write this is that just walked into the other room and heard the TV playing a song of hers I had never heard called \\"One More Time\\" which is the final song from a Kevin Costner film from 1999 called \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and while I missed the film and just caught the song during the closing credits I knew it was Laura imediately. Interestingly, this song in English is not on her other albums and the only other english speaking song not on \\"Fromthe Inside\\" that I am aware of is \\"Go the extra mile\\" which is one of her all time best songs, in my opinion.    Listen to her stuff, she was Grammy Latin artist of the year 2 years ago, for a reason.    Thank you C.L.T. for introducing me to her in 2001. Drop me an email if you see this review, too.
1594489505|5.0|As great as the Kite Runner is, I enjoyed Khalid Hosseini's second novel much more.     The story is intense in the best possible way, a way that engages you to make you feel sorrow, happiness, curiosity, and anger. For me not knowing much of Afghanistan's past or present the book was a real eye opener. It reminds many of us how lucky we are and how easily we can take life for granted. Each chapter left me wanting to know more and more. It is devastating at how women are treated in some countries & cultures, this book will make you feel as if you were right there watching these terrible things happen. Mariam and Laila are two women whose life story will really touch you.     Hopefully Mr. Hosseini will soon delight us with another fanstastic novel!
B000BNX4MC|4.0|That is what this film is all about. True the film is dated and has some major plot holes which have been covered by other reviews, but on the whole, a wonderful trip down memory lane for those old enough to remember. No one is immune to the pranks and antics of this film. I tried similar things on my teachers in high school and thought I was original until this film appeared. Give it a shot... you should be laughing within minutes of the action.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Let me tell you a story, and take you back in time.<br />The year, was 1986. The world had last known Batman as Adam West, a campy, blue caped superhero who fought the likes of a silly goofball named the Joker, among others, whilst passing on good advice to his good natured compadre, Robin. His use of puns, bad one liners and amusing dance routines genuinely made people laugh, and unfortunately reinforced the idea that the Batman was nothing more than a wierd man in a costume, masquerading around town with his teenage pals.<br /><br />A man named Michael Uslan had been trying for years, as one of his life's pursuits, to awaken to the world a different vision of Batman, in his opinion, and many others, the real vision of Batman, as a Dark Guardian of his city, striking terror into the hearts of criminals as he stalked the city rooftops, protecting the innocent.<br />Finally, with the help of a well funded producer, and the creator of Batman himself, Bob Kane, Michael Uslan managed to get Warner Bros. to accept the possibility of making a serious Batman film.<br /><br />And so the great wheel began to turn, towards a date in 1989 when the world rediscovered a hero.<br /><br />Fast forward to the summer of 1989 and you'll find thousands of fans, dressed in Batman tshirts and hats, waiting to see this mega-blockbuster movie.<br /><br />The first Batman movie portrays the Dark Knight as Adam West never could, opening the eyes of people everywhere to a stoic, avenging man whose quest to defeat evil in his city has lead him to become a terrifying creature of the night, The Batman. Micheal Keaton uses his talents to portray Batman as a driven man, one who masquerades as just a social billionaire in the daytime, all the while waiting to descend into another life, the one he truly wants to live. Dark and mysterious, Tim Burton's vision of the Batman encompasses the best of the comics that inspired him, portraying an avenging guardian angel, whose only purpose is to defend the weak and innocent people of his city.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson portrays an insane, but brilliant madman, the Joker, who terrorizes the citizens of Gotham with his cruel and deadly jokes.<br /><br />Tim Burton redefines all the elements of Batman's world, and brings them to the big screen in a way never before seen by audiences. An engaging, twisting and turning plot drives the characters and the film to a satisfying ending that will have you wishing it was Halloween, so you too could put on the cape and cowl of the Batman.<br /><br />All in all, the first Batman movie is by far one of the best, and it captures Batman as he was always meant to be captured, as the Dark Knight we all know today.Jack Nicholson portrays an insane, but brilliant madman, the Joker, who terrorizes the citizens of Gotham with his cruel and deadly jokes.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Unique perspective. Very intriguing. Just downright enjoyable.    Its a CREATIVE and inspired bit of work... Yes it has some areas that  could have been better, but it is very fun and captivating.  Kudos to the actors and Joss Whedon.    PS.  To Richard with a previous review... wth did you want? a remake  of some other space series? uh no, its not called FireTREK or FireWARS.
1592402038|2.0|Well, perhaps the author is right about most of us. We just don't care enough about the misuse and abuse of our punctuation. I bought this book based on a recommendation of a relative. But not even halfway through the book, I find her argument for correct usage of punctuation quite tedious and repetitive; her passion and intensity for the subject, approaching freakishness. Maybe that's her humor. I don't know. All I know is that it was funny for about 10 pages... then she totally lost me. I have better use of my time reading something else a bit more compelling, and actually funny.
1594489505|5.0|A second thought-provoking good read by Dr. Hosseini.  He educates while he entertains.  American readers are led to a better understanding of human dignity amid the on-going tragedy that is Afghanistan.  The morning newpaper reports of what the US is inflicting on that long-battered country again (2007) are made more meaningful -- and to be mourned.
1400079276|4.0|As my first Murakami novel,  I didnt quite know what to expect....    but it truly was a good novel, at times i found myself rivited... at other times i felt like i was reading a... little too much philosphy that had nothing to do with the story.  I really like Oshima, but i felt like that was his main reason for being there.  To talk about philosphy.  The ending also left a little to be desired... but wow look at all the negatives ive said!!    THIS WAS  a great novel, incredibly well written, much deeper that the average novel and therefore more worthwhile to read.  Beautifully written.  Check it out!
B000PTYP5C|5.0|One of the most diverse albums to date for them. I think it was a great combination of heavy metal and relaxing ballads. Once again they prove they've still got those progressive roots they're steming from with songs like Ministry of Lost Souls & In The Presence of Enemies (altough part 1 is stronger for me). The heavy side is brought out bigger and better than even in The Dark Eternal Night, while the ballad was revealed in Repentance. The weakest track on the album in my opinion was Prophets of War, which is probably one of DT's worst tracks. Overall this is probably their 2nd/3rd best album, with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence being #1 and Scenes From a Memory being ties at 2 or 3. GREAT STUFF!
0385340559|2.0|Not one of his best; he's resting on his laurels. Plotline weak, theme repeated explicitly beyond all need, dialogue repetitious and by rote. For example, do we really need characters telling us that life's a b**** and then you die? Reacher is still a great invention, tho.  Looking forward to the next and improved.
0596009208|2.0|The pace of this book is wacky. On one hand, it moves slowly, often repeating basic information 3 or 4 times in an attempt to drill it into your head. The inescapable blurbs, pictures, and sidebars, while amusing, are also distracting and sometimes feel like \\"filler\\". On the other hand, the book introduces somewhat advanced concepts like loops, encapsulation, etc very quickly, but glosses over most of the details, promising to explain the details in later chapters but more often than not failing to deliver on that promise.    It's hard to tell who this book is aimed at. Beginners with no programming experience can learn basic OO concepts, but the complete lack of actual programming exercises (as opposed to \\"exercises\\" like crossword puzzles) will prevent them from getting their feet wet.  Those readers with even a modest programming background will be left with more questions than answers, as the book explains only those details which are necessary to build its sample programs.
0143038419|5.0|First sentence:  \\"When you're traveling in India - especially through holy sites and Ashrams - you see a lot of people wearing beads around their necks.\\"<br /><br /> After a bad divorce and a heartbreaking rebound relationship, Gilbert follows her desires and plans a yearlong trip to visit all three of the countries she yearns to see - Italy (to eat, for pleasure), India (to pray, for devotion), and Bali (because a few years earlier a medicine man had told her to come back).<br /><br /> I was especially looking forward to her Ashram experience in the second section, but after all the fabulous meals in Italy, I paused before starting that section - how could months of chanting and praying and doing service work for the Ashram compete with all those lovingly described Italian meals??  Yet I was not disappointed, as Gilbert's experiences in India built on (and even required) her emotional recovery in Italy.<br /><br /> Other readers loved Richard from Texas in the India section, but I found him a bit too self-consciously quirky, at least as Gilbert describes him.  The final section, in Bali, lacks the focus of the first two, but really Gilbert didn't have the plan of the earlier part of her year of travel.  Still, her voice is so personal and lively, and her exploration of healing and following the interior life, especially for someone so extroverted, made it one of the most memorable and enjoyable books I've read in years.  You end up wanting to invite her to all your dinner parties for the rest of your life.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Father of Climatology Throws Up at the Thought of Al Gore's 'An Inconvenient Truth'  Posted by Noel Sheppard on June 18, 2007 - 11:46.   Reid Bryson, the 87-year-old considered to be the father of scientific climatology, has once again spoken out strongly against anthropogenic global warming theories being regularly disseminated by alarmists in the media and the scientific community.    In an interview published by Wisconsin's Capital Times Monday, Bryson spoke about the money involved in this \\"religion,\\" and when asked about soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore's schlockumentary \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" marvelously responded (emphasis added throughout):    \\"Don't make me throw up...It is not science. It is not true.\\"    But Bryson had loads more to say on this issue (better fasten your seatbelts!):    There is no question the earth has been warming. It is coming out of the \\"Little Ice Age,\\" he said in an interview this week.    \\"However, there is no credible evidence that it is due to mankind and carbon dioxide. We've been coming out of a Little Ice Age for 300 years. We have not been making very much carbon dioxide for 300 years. It's been warming up for a long time,\\" Bryson said.    Think Bryson will be interviewed any time soon by Katie, Charlie, or Brian? Regardless, the article continued:    The Little Ice Age was driven by volcanic activity. That settled down so it is getting warmer, he said.    Humans are polluting the air and adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but the effect is tiny, Bryson said.    \\"It's like there is an elephant charging in [sic, the room] and you worry about the fact that there is a fly sitting on its head. It's just a total misplacement of emphasis,\\" he said. \\"It really isn't science because there's no really good scientific evidence.\\"    Just because almost all of the scientific community believes in man-made global warming proves absolutely nothing, Bryson said. \\"Consensus doesn't prove anything, in science or anywhere else, except in democracy, maybe.\\"    For the alarmists who love to depict every skeptic as being on the take of oil companies:    Bryson, 87, was the founding chairman of the department of meteorology at UW-Madison and of the Institute for Environmental Studies, now known as the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. He retired in 1985, but has gone into the office almost every day since. He does it without pay.    \\"I have now worked for zero dollars since I retired, long enough that I have paid back the people of Wisconsin every cent they paid me to give me a wonderful, wonderful career. So we are even now. And I feel good about that,\\" said Bryson.    How refreshing. Can the alarmists in the scientific community - and folks like soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore - claim that they are doing their \\"work\\" for nothing? Read on:    So, if global warming isn't such a burning issue, why are thousands of scientists so concerned about it?    \\"Why are so many thousands not concerned about it?\\" Bryson shot back.    \\"There is a lot of money to be made in this,\\" he added. \\"If you want to be an eminent scientist you have to have a lot of grad students and a lot of grants. You can't get grants unless you say, 'Oh global warming, yes, yes, carbon dioxide.'\\"    Bryson then pointed out how the media work:    Reporters will often call the meteorology building seeking the opinion of a scientist and some beginning graduate student will pick up the phone and say he or she is a meteorologist, Bryson said. \\"And that goes in the paper as 'scientists say.'\\"    The word of this young graduate student then trumps the views of someone like Bryson, who has been working in the field for more than 50 years, he said. \\"It is sort of a smear.\\"    Of course, then some ignoramus will copy the opinions of this graduate student and dissiminate them throughout the blogosphere as yet another example of the consensus. NewsBusters members should be very familiar with this:    Bryson said he recently wrote something on the subject and two graduate students told him he was wrong, citing research done by one of their professors. That professor, Bryson noted, is probably the student of one of his students.    \\"Well, that professor happened to be wrong,\\" he said.    Sound familiar? And this is why many view all of this nonsense as \\"junk science\\":    \\"There is very little truth to what is being said and an awful lot of religion. It's almost a religion. Where you have to believe in anthropogenic (or man-made) global warming or else you are nuts.\\"    Yep. I've witnessed that as well. Of course, what is the real science involved:    While Bryson doesn't think that global warming is man-made, he said there is some evidence of an effect from mankind, but not an effect of carbon dioxide.    For example, in Wisconsin in the last 100 years the biggest heating has been around Madison, Milwaukee and in the Southeast, where the cities are. There was a slight change in the Green Bay area, he said. The rest of the state shows no warming at all.    \\"The growth of cities makes it hotter, but that was true back in the 1930s, too,\\" Bryson said. \\"Big cities were hotter than the surrounding countryside because you concentrate the traffic and you concentrate the home heating. And you modify the surface, you pave a lot of it.\\"    Yet, the most wonderful part of this interview was:    Bryson didn't see Al Gore's movie about global warming, \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\"    \\"Don't make me throw up,\\" he said. \\"It is not science. It is not true.\\"    Bravo, Mr. Bryson. And thanks.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Cage is one of those actors you either love or hate.  In this he does a pretty good job in convincing you to think positive about him.  He does a great job playing the arms smuggler during the early 90s rising to power largely due to his connections back in his home country the Ukraine and a ruthless streak to not care who the guns are sold to.<br /><br />Some may say this film is too over political and moralistic I would say not.  It simply describes how arms smugglers get so rich off the misery of others.  Most people I am sure know well about the illegal diamond trade that took place during some of the most bloody conflicts in West Africa and the Westerners (and Lebanese for that matter) who profited from it.  The mercenaries who were former members of the apartheid South African army hired and paid in diamonds to fight dirty wars in Africa for tin pot dictators.<br /><br />The film begins with Cages life in a poor area of New York.  Faking a Jewish identity to escape from communist Russia his family make a modest living but Cage seeking a way out makes a few connections and gets himself into the arms trade.  Soon the Soviet Union collapses and he reacquaints himself with an old relative who just happens to be high up in the old army and business goes from there.<br /><br />Soon he becomes one of the major shipper of illegal arms to Liberia profiting on the misery of years of conflict.<br /><br />This is a great film to watch, its not too heavy on the politics and has enough little sub plots to keep you occupied.<br /><br />Great film recommended.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Every song on this album is great.  Each one could build a career, each one could be a single.  They span a myriad of emotions and moods, but all run rife with the amazingly amazing vocal prowess of a girl whose voice is anything but little.  'Between the Lines' affects me as the saddest, most beautifully bittersweet pleasure for my ears.  And songs I thought of as already complete from her independent release \\"Careful Confessions\\" (find it if you can and buy it at any price!) have matured considerably, and leave your ears tingling between every track.      She is as smart as she is funny as she is beautiful as she is rapturous in song.  All that comes through in this little bitty jewel case.      Enjoy.
076531178X|3.0|For a thousand years, the Final Empire has been ruled by an immortal tyrant, but amidst the cities plagued by ashfalls, and a society torn by brutal class divisions, Kelsier, a charismatic underground leader, has devised the ultimate con game--a plan to overthrow the Lord Ruler himself.      The novel's lackluster premise is chock-full of genre stereotypes--the Hero, the Dark Lord on his Dark Throne, the oppressive empire.  Eliza of the Pygmalion manifests yet again, as a young street girl puts on a gown and infiltrates the nobility--who have nothing better to do that backstab each other during endless balls.  The Good Guys are immediately recognizable from the villains, and grey characters are an extreme rarity.      But as the story begins in earnest, the second half makes the book worth reading;  once I read past the first 100 pages, I was reluctant to put MISTBORN down--I didn't, in fact, until I had finished the book.  The author develops a magic system that is actually original and interesting, the characters' personalities deepen, and the plot takes unprecedented turns.  Kelsier is no Locke Lamora[[[ASIN:055358894X The Lies of Locke Lamora]]], but his bid for a military coup is far better thought out than he originally lets on.  The ending is well done, with several clever plot twists, and I actually liked how the story behind the Lord Ruler played out.      All in all, MISTBORN is by no means a _great_ book, but it is definitely an _entertaining_ one, and I look forward to reading more novels by Brandon Sanderson in the future.
037582913X|5.0|This book was the first interactive media experience I ever had.  Today that is no big deal, but pre-Microsoft in every home this was an eye opening experience.  Sure, I had read books, but this one was talking to me, even pleading at some points.  That. my friends, is genious.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|This new effort from Dream Theater is easily their most balanced album since A Change Of Seasons. I noticed most of the reviewers here are being a little too picky on some of the songs or absolutely have no clue what the story is about. This is just one fan's take, but this is one hell of an album.   1. In The Presence Of Enemies (Part 1) is a 9 minute epic. The lead-in to the song is killer and it's the perfect teaser for the even more epic second part.   2. Forsaken has a nice intro from Ruddess, my only mini complaint is that James LaBrie sings the song a tad too slow. Still, a very sold track.   3. Constant Motion has a really cool vibe with Portnoy's double bass runs in sync with Petrucci's strong riffing. Yes, Portnoy's vocal abilities is a little rough but it compliments this song so well with LaBrie's highs.  4. The Dark Eternal Night reminds me of 'Honor Thy Father' from Train Of Thought. It's just really cool, fast, and strong aggressive vocals. Jordan has a little fun during the mini breaks of this song too.   5. Repentance is the most cerebral song this band has ever done. To those who dont understand the concept, listen to 'The Glass Prison' from Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence, then 'This Dying Soul' from TOT, and 'The Root Of All Evil' from Octavarium. To the one that said there were vocal samples, it's all spoken word from the likes of Steve Vai, Satch, Chris Jericho, Jon Anderson, and Neal Morse to name a few. A beautiful and emotional song from beginning to end.   6. Prophets Of War gets right to the point with a very good sounding vocal from LaBrie telling his story of war's greed and senseless killing of innocent people. Listen close and you'll hear 100 people in chorus making this song even more personal on some levels.   7. Ministry Of Lost Souls is a Dream Theater classic. It has the speed playing, the slower balladry (especially in the beginning) and the tight vocals. A sweet piece of music nearly 15 minutes in length.   8. In The Presence OfEnemies (Part 2) closes out this epic album with a very dark story of the Dark Master. This 16 and a half minute journey takes the listener to his/her deepest darkest past selling their soul to the Dark Master only to ask for it back. What a way to close out an album.

0307346609|5.0|This book was worth every dime I paid for it - I even feel a bit guilty buying it on sale. Max Brooks takes the zombie genre, a topic that has been beaten to death more than its fair share of times, and makes it new. He breathes new life into the undead, if that sounds possible. It's a book that you simply can't put down.    Honestly, I can't think of any better way to have written this book. Rather than telling us a story, he lets the characters tell it instead. We hear the tales of the survivors of the war, and in their eyes, what the costs were. Brooks does his HOMEWORK on so many facets of world, military, and obscure culture that you end up with something that would be worthy of front-page coverage if World War Z had been real.     Brooks has officially beaten the pants off of Stephen King, Koontz, and Straus in one fell swoop. 10/10, A+, and dear God keep on writing!
0143034901|5.0|I stumbled upon this book one day in my local bookstore and purchased it simply because it looked interesting (you would be surprised how often this actually works) and I needed a good, long book to read on our road trip to the grand canyon. I was instantly absorbed. I don't remember ever having read anything quite like it. Layer upon layer wove together seamlessly with a thrilling mystery at its core. I adored the characters, and the dialogue was beautiful. It was everything I ever wanted in a book. Two days into it, we reached the Grand Canyon. I popped out of the car for a quick look around before climbing right back in to continue reading. My parents were bewildered. I was left speechless by the end of the story. I gave it to both of my parents to read, and they had exactly the same reaction that I did (they're both writers, so this is high praise). We've been recommending the book to everyone we know since then, and they have all come back with the same reaction. An absolute must read, and will keep you up all night. It's a perfect book to get lost in during the summer, especially at the beach.<br /><br />Just read it.
B000LC55F2|3.0|Christopher Nolan's films are usually intelligently plotted and artistically well-made. \\"The Prestige,\\" unfortunately, is quite a letdown. This is no \\"Memento\\"; it's not even a \\"Batman Begins.\\"<br /><br />What sinks the film are its two big secrets (don't worry, I'm not going to reveal them here). One of the secrets is so scientifically ludicrous as to inspire laughter rather than awe. The other is so hoary and shopworn that one can only groan. Yes, the hackneyed secret is threaded into the film with cleverness and skill, but as the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd.<br /><br />The acting and direction are fine throughout, but the underlying plot weaknesses keep the film firmly anchored to mediocrity.
B000SVZIR6|1.0|I'm sure this is a great movie, but I rented it from Amazon's Unbox service.  I don't speak a word of Siamese, and the Unbox version does not include any subtitles.  I was unable to understand anything that did not involve someone talking to Anna - for instance, the situation with the traitor and whatever happened with the concubine.  All I can say is that I am CERTAIN that I missed most of the movie because of this.  I have requested a refund from Amazon and do not recommend that anyone rent this from Amazon Unbox.  I don't know if their purchased videos include the proper subtitles, but the response I got from customer service was that Unbox does not support subtitles, so it's probably missing them too.  What a disappointment!
0060245867|5.0|This short book was such a favorite in our house when the kids were small, it fell apart. It was a read-aloud for the most part, but also helped the children recognize words.<br /><br />They memorized the wonderful story, and could then recognize the words as we read together.<br /><br />It's a repetitive tale, but cute in the same way as Seuss stories, and my kids loved it just as much.<br /><br />I'm at long last trying to trim the picture book collection down from several hundred volumes, and this one is not going anywhere, I'm afraid. The children, even in their teens, can't part with it.<br /><br />A real classic.

075640407X|5.0|Short and Sweet Review - one of the best Fantasy novels to come out in a long time, and more suprising is the fact that it's Mr Rothfuss' debut.  I couldn't put this book down, and yet I found myself loathing the thought of finishing it.  I actually began re-reading chapters to prolong the experience and drink in every facet of the story.  This is hopefully the start of a monumentous literary career, one which i will happily follow throughout.
B000OVLBEY|2.0|Superhero films are usually cool. Marvel's done pretty good - \\"Spiderman\\" dropped jaws, of course, and I thought even \\"Hulk\\" and \\"Daredevil\\" had some merits. \\"Ghost Rider\\" has some, too, but not quite enough to compensate for the rest of its limp-hanging nonsense.<br />While I admit to not ever having read the comic and that this undoubtedly excludes the 'fan factor' that might influence my perception (and rating) of the movie, \\"Ghost Rider\\" simply isn't a very good film, from beginning to end.<br /><br />Two features of the film serve as its assets - the Ghost Rider graphics and action, and, to a lesser extent, Nicholas Cage in his Johnny Blaze persona: the silver screen embodiment of the skull-headed bounty hunter on his flaming bike is nifty, and Cage actually being convincing as a southern motorcycle stuntdevil. That's about it.<br />The rest of the cast? - doesn't matter who plays the characters, for anybody's hardly given the screentime to grow on you.<br />The storyline? - didn't I see it ten years ago in \\"Spawn?\\"<br />The acting? - Peter Fonda is Christensen-like atrocious as Mephistopoles (aka Mephisto, aka the devil).<br /><br />If you can get over those aspects, you should be alright. True to its source, the film plays out like a comic book - choppity-chop, from scene to scene, with bad placement of flashbacks here and there, in-between a convoluted story of love, sacrifice, and supernatural action (the last part will test your brain - why can Blaze suddenly turn into the Ghost Rider in the morning, in the nick of time, after it's been made clear that he can only transform at night?).<br /><br />Whether or not the film prides itself on being smart or dumb is the real questions - when not focusing on the story of hero-sacrificing-romance, it's all into contracts and soul-stealing and whether or not souls make you stronger... Eventually, I began to wonder whether the film was produced by two different directors, who operated in turns.<br /><br />In the end, I was just glad that it was over - \\"Ghost Rider\\" has a cool premise, and the least it deserved was to be a mindless, mildly-successfull blockbuster...all it is, though, is a mindless toiletbuster, that Nicholas Cage will probably come to regret performing in.\\" has a cool premise, and the least it deserved was to be a mindless, mildly-successfull blockbuster...all it is, though, is a mindless toiletbuster, that Nicholas Cage will probably come to regret performing in.
B000065BPB|2.0|I am very disappointed with these headphones. They sound very good, but ironically, the fit is too tight, so you have to take them off after listening to them for a while. What's the point of that?     I'm not exaggerating about how tight they are. Read others' reviews of this headphone on Amazon, and you will see that it is a consistent problem. This problem does not occur with other headphones.    After about 30 minutes of wearing them, the pressure exerted on my head is too much to bear. I've tried to pull them apart for a period of time, but from others' reviews on Amazon, the headband is known to break, so I haven't tried to pull them apart that wide. At any rate, after a few days, they contract and become tight again.    I know what good headphones are. I have a pair of Sennheiser 595 at home; those feel and sound heavenly, but those are open-air headphones, so sound will leak out. I'm thus still looking for a good pair of closed-air headphones.
B00000IWVS|5.0|This Argerich Chopin performance, recorded by EMI in 1965 while she was actually under contract to DG is formidable for an artist so early in her career. Both the artistry and sound are superb and it's a shame we fans had to wait so long for this recording to appear. These Chopin performances completely justify the competition judges decision to award her the grand prize at the 1965 Warsaw International Chopin Competition. It's a collection must have!
B00005JPQT|3.0|It's been twelve years since \\"Die Hard With A Vengeance\\" came out to theaters.  You want to know what I was thinking about in those last twelve years?  Well, I was thinking about the Playstation 2 and then the Playstation 3.  I was looking forward to all the upcoming Pixar films while dreading whether or not a decent sequel could be made from \\"Shrek.\\"  I was debating the comparisons in quality between Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, and then ultimately decided to shift the comparison so that everyone could agree that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy was better then \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy (many of my friends though have stated that, sadly, they will not watch \\"The Godfather\\" trilogy out of fear that it turns out to be the movie trilogy of all time).  I went from thinking girls were scary, selfish, overrated creatures to think they were beautiful, fun, and (at times) scary people.<br /><br />I will say this though, I hadn't given much though to what John McClaine's been up to in the last twelve years.  Granted, I only saw the original Die Hard movies fairly recently, but after the third installment I can't say I felt there were any unanswered questions I had about the character.  But when given the opportunity to check up on an old friend, how can you possibly say no?  So I went to \\"Live Free And Die Hard\\" to see what old John McClaine was up to these days.  Apparently he's still a run-down LAPD cop.  He's divorced and has a non-speaking relationship with his daughter who, like her mother, shows her disgust for her father by using her mothers maiden name (no attempt to speak with his son happens in this film).  Because McClaine is always in the wrong place at the wrong time, he is called to pick up a computer hacker (Justin Long, who you may know as Mac) on the way home.<br /><br />This results in a shootout from the hackers apartment, which then results in the two teaming up to stop a bunch of internet terrorists, which then results in lots of shooting and explosions, which then results with a Kevin Smith cameo appearance, which then results with one more explosion, capping off with a loss of hearing.  Though I must say, McClaine has still got it.  In fact, despite the fact that he's 52 years old, I was surprised to discover John McClaine seemed to be in better shape now then he was twenty years ago in the first Die Hard movie.  There's a scene where got gets beat up by a Chinese girl, shot, thrown out a window, lands on a pipe, falls off the pipe and onto a truck, falls off the truck, and then he just picks himself back to run up the stairs fight this same Chinese woman on an elevator with hardly a scratch on him.  This bloodless and cartoony fight is either result of some serious working out, or the result of the new PG-13 rating.<br /><br />What's also noticeable is that McClaine is still doing his own stunts.  In a year where almost all the big budget Hollywood movies have epic CGI battles all over the place, it's nice to see some good old fashioned stunt work in \\"Live Free And Die Hard.\\"  Though the stunt work is still real, it is disheartening to see many of the story elements and action sequences more cartoony then they ever have been before.  I wanted to ask John how a fight with a British dude in the first Die Hard movie results in a sprained arm and black eye, while leaping five stories from a fighter jet results in a \\"Woo hoo!\\" scream.  I expected the leap from the fighter jet to result in a broken leg or two, but I guess I was wrong.  Still, despite my questions, I must admit I enjoyed catching up with John.  Despite the fact that he doesn't appear to have the bite he used to have, I did enjoy watching him in action once more.  I just wish he'd finally get his family problems worked out.<br /><br />Rating: ***sults with a Kevin Smith cameo appearance, which then results with one more explosion, capping off with a loss of hearing.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Well, I didn't mind that the Bennets lived on a farm - I minded that they were then called the Bennets. I didn't mind that Bingley was a fool, but the fact that they called him Bingley. I didn't mind that Elizabeth clearly liked Darcy from the beginning, but I did mind that they called her Elizabeth.     Really, I didn't mind this movie at all. What I did mind is that they called it Pride and Prejudice. It was NOT Pride and Prejudice, it was only loosely based on that book. Elizabeth would NEVER tell Darcy to call her Goddess Divine or any one of the other names. Mr. Bennet would NEVER show such affection for his wife and daughters so openly (with the exception, of course, of Jane and Lizzy). Mr. Darcy would NEVER have gone walking toward Elizabeth's house in the middle of the night in only his night clothes (and, for that matter, his aunt would never leave her mansion in the middle of the night, especially not to visit him and Elizabeth)    Still, the movie had some great parts. The scenery was amazing. The scene in which Darcy and Elizabeth first touch hands, beautiful. Maybe if it had a different name, I would have given this movie more stars. It's just that they called it Pride and Prejudice, and it was not, so I can not.
B00005JPFC|5.0|Movies, like food, are a form of expression and masterwork.  You have all different sorts of movies, and like foods they all have their own individual flavors.  \\"A Mighty Heart\\" tasted like a tough, juicy meat that may have been difficult to stomach, but leaves a lingering taste in your mouth that you are not soon to forget.  \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\" tasted like a cake that delivered a sugar rush and then left me feeling empty.  \\"Live Free and Die Hard\\" tasted like a fast food meal, which was tasty and yummy, but easily disposable.  If Pixar's latest film \\"Ratatouille\\" is to be compared to food (and it would be an insult not to bring in a food metaphor), then I would say it was like a home cooked meal by a family member.  The texture is fleeting but rich.  The taste simple yet powerful.  The meal short but filling.<br /><br />In other words, we have a strong contender for one of the best films of the year.  Like the great chefs they are, the genius's at Pixar have perfected another great movie.  This one is about a rat named Remy, who is going through a bit of an emotional crisis.  He has a wonderful gift of smell that can tell the difference between different spices, textures, and smells of food, the kind of scent many aspiring chefs wish they could have.  Remy has this gift, and then finds himself reduced to using his gift to sniff garbage his rat pact brings him to make sure there's no poison in their loot (come to think of it, I'd be in a bad mood too if I was stuck with that job).  Remy feels an urge to do something more with his life, and gets that chance when he ends up helping a hopeless Italian boy named Alfredo Linguini cook food for a three star restaurant.<br /><br />The restaurant, known as \\"Gusteau's,\\" used to be a five star restaurant, but lost a couple of stars from a nasty food critic, and is now on the verge of selling out to cheap TV dinners and frozen tacos as a way to make money.  Remy saves the reputation of the restaurant by cooking some winning meals through Linguini, who starts complicating matters by falling in love with his (only) female co-worker, a tough but kind French woman named Colette.  And here is where you'll find the difference between a great movie and a bad movie.  A dish that is filling and wonderful to savor, while other dishes are simply cotton candy.  This movie is alive.  It understands characters, it understands emotions, it knows what is worth telling.<br /><br />The visual style is a key ingredient in this movie, as there are many scenes where Remy envisions what his meals are going to taste like, and it's done with a simple but powerful visual element where we can see his taste buds in colorful style.  Think of the number trick in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" and replace the computer graphics with hippy colors.  The characters come off as hopeless but realistic.  Contrary to what the previews show, Linguini and Collete do harbor feelings for each other, and it's fun to watch how their love for each other developed.  The movie takes it's time to let the two fall in love, and as an added side dish, we get to see them in an actual relationship for a good portion of the film.  The previews thankfully didn't give away a majority of the story twists in the movie, and so much of the story came as a surprise to me.<br /><br />I felt like a customer who ordered something from a menu, saw the ingredients, but wasn't prepared for how good it was going to taste.  A small role for the legendary Academy Award winning star Peter O'Toole is not a gimmicky \\"look, we got Peter O'Toole\\" moment, but rather fully fleshed out supporting role.  At the end of the movie O'Toole's character give a great speech about how critics have fairly easy jobs.  They have little to risk, the power of their opinion doesn't always have an effect on the population, but people put their works in front of critics with the hope that they will write positive things about their work.  This scene brought a tear to myeye, I must admit.<br /><br />\\"Ratatouille\\" is the best animated film I've seen this year.  It's one of the best films of the year.  It's Pixar's best film since \\"Finding Nemo,\\" and it's my third favorite Pixar movie behind the aforementioned \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Toy Story 2.\\"  That stupid French song by Camille is so darn catchy I'm listening to it on my iPod while I type this review right now.  It's a shame that critics don't have much power with their recommendations anymore. $50 million dollar advertising campaigns have made critics warnings of bad movies something that isn't taken seriously anymore, while reviews of good movies don't help a film much anymore.  If this movie fails to make at least $200 million dollars I'm going to be really, really ticked off.  It's bad enough that \\"Spider-Man 3\\" and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\" sucked up cash it didn't deserve, but now there are predictions that \\"Ratatouille\\" may be a bomb at the box office.<br /><br />I really pray that this isn't the case.  I pray people read good reviews, that they see this wonderful film, and that they see it again if there is nothing else worth seeing (and that's a very strong probability at this point in time).  But I get this nagging feels that the critics voice will not be heard, and that people are going to skip a truly wonderful film because there's not as much marketing money thrown behind it.  Oh well, people choosing things that cater to the lowest common denominator over quality products is nothing new, and is certainly expected these days.  After all, when you have Wendy's, Burger King, Jack In The Box, In-N-Out Burger, and Carl's Jr. out there, it's amazing to find that people still choose to go to McDonald's.

B000Q9IZ5C|2.0|Okay, I know I'm in the minority here, and how blastphemous it is to say that something the great Joss Whedon did was sub-par, but really - this movie was NOWHERE near the quality of the series.  The direction was sloppy, the script was overstuffed (clearly he was trying to force every idea he wasn't able to do on tv into the movie), the characters were treated poorly.  And in the end, the swashbuckling element of FIREFLY was completely lost.  For me - and again, this is my opinion, and I realize it's not everyone's - what made FIREFLY great was utterly abandoned.  I felt like Whedon was pissed off at his creation and wanted to savage it.    Not that the idea for the film was bad.  Quite the contrary - the Reevers were one of the best things about the show, and getting into their story should have been great.  But ultimately, I was sorely disappointed.
B000NDEZPA|4.0|We listened to Brandi live when she opened for Train in Madison, WI sometime ago. For her -I'm sure- it was a tall order considering how powerful Train is while playing live. Yet, she was up to the task with a superb voice. Then when she signed our CD (her first), we were so flabbergasted by her young age and charm. Intriguingly in her two CDs the sound does not reflect her vocal prowess.     I tend to agree with prior reviews about a bit of lackadaisical creativity/energy in the middle of this CD (compared to her first one). Yet, Brandi's soft melodical vocalization mellows that inconsistency, such as in the first part of \\"Again Today\\".     Nonetheless, one song makes this whole album valuable: \\"The Story\\". When I bought the CD I had to repeat it several times just to make sure it was for real: \\"All of these lines across my face / tell you the story of who I am / so many stories / of where I've been.\\" And then, as the song progresses there's this guitar solo so simple but so timely. And then there's the powerful beat of those drums anticipating the climax: Brandi screaming at the top of her lungs \\"ALL OF THESE LINES ACROSS MY FACE!!!!\\" If you want the full effect, just close down doors and windows and raise the basses a bit (you need those drums to pound your heart), and turn up the volume. Sing-along... if you can follow Brandi's vocal fireworks.     Memorable!

1400063515|5.0|Fooled By Randomness was a bit better, but maybe I'm just prejudiced because it's the first one I read, like the first in a movie sequel often seems like the best. We compare the second to the first, not the first to the second.  If you're alive and paying attention, you need to understand the general ideas in Taleb's books. Essentially, the universe is designed such that everything that can happen will happen, and we cannot predict when or what. The financial markets are a mini universe, where lots of things happen repetitively, but not identically, and each event affects subsequent events in ways that are neither obvious nor intuitive.  I almost gave it 4 stars because I found some points redundant, and some overused terminology, extremistan for instance, which I found interfered with the flow of the text.  However, the book is worth the read just for the turkey story, which is an absolutely perfect example of inattentive self absorbed expectation. I took away a star for repetitiveness, but added it back for the turkey tale.
B000001FLI|5.0|A friend of mine had a couple of Roy Buchanan's albums but I hardly gave them a second thought. So when I spotted a cassette of this album in a local record stores free bin I took it and now having listened to it I am happily surprise.Roy Buchacan has the great versitility on his guitar that many of the 60's greats such as Hendrix has,but production wise Roy leaves it to the bare bones-so all you can hear is his great tone on his instrument and (for better or worse) his monotone,egoless vocal stylings.Although I often hear Buchanan listed as a blues guitarist this particular recording is very musically diverse-covering rock,pop,country and even zydeco along with his blues influences.The two zydeco rhythm tunes hear \\"Cajun\\" and \\"Haunted House\\" are two of the best songs hear with their peppy tempo and equally peppy riffing.The album starts off with two lightweight sounding (but only deceptively so) poppish tunes in the gentle \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and the cathy \\"I Am A Lonesome Fugitive\\",which has a strong country-rock flavor.As far as the blues goes \\"John's Blues\\" has the unusual destinction of adding a very Eastern/Arabic sounding modality into Roy's bluesy guitar solos.On \\"Pete's Blues\\" Roy brightens up his blues with a lot of tasty melodic surprises and playful \\"fluttering\\" riffs that totally transend the rather stereotypcial blues-rock backing. \\"The Messiah Will Come Again\\" is and almost gospelish narrative spoken by Roy in almost a whisper and is a very surprising song to have on an album like this.And yes-Roy has thought you you country swing lovers too with a cover of the Hank Williams classic \\"Hey Good Lookin\\" and,if you listen closley even that has a little zydeco/cajun rhythm in it too!During an era when Bob Dylan,The Band and others were really going for a way to try to draw the rootsiness from rock n' roll Roy Buchanan really just showed us how many different American roots oriented music's rocked pretty hard on their own.And by giving the album an unadorned but modern production everyone seems to have gotton the point and really enjoy this music.d but modern production everyone seems to have gotton the point and really enjoy this music.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|So somewhat to my surprise, it turns out that, in general, I actually like James Bond films. This comes as something a shock to me, because normally I tend to prefer more highbrow cinema. But there's something about Bond...    When the Bond movies are at their best ([[ASIN:B000M53GMC Goldfinger]], [[ASIN:B000M53GMW Licence To Kill]], [[ASIN:B000LY4J3E On Her Majesty's Secret Service - 2-Disc Ultimate Edition]], [[ASIN:B000M53GNG Thunderball]]), they are among the best films ever made. Roger Ebert even put \\"Goldfinger\\" on his list of Great Films. When they're bad, however, they can really stink up the joint. [[ASIN:B000NIBURG Moonraker]] anyone? Yeah, I thought not.    Given the way the franchise had been leaning in the last few films (invisible car, anyone?), rebooting it was, perhaps, the only really course of action. Thank goodness when they rebooted it, they did a great job!    This is a VERY good film. Excellent action sequences, a tight plot, good acting and beautiful scenery (even though it wasn't filmed in Montenegro, which is a pity). The villain, while certainly unpleasant and weird, isn't nearly as unrealistic as some of the other Bond bad guys, and his plans are much more interesting than, say, world domination.    Daniel Craig makes for an excellent Bond. I would say, just on this one movie, that he is, thus far, almost as good, if not actually as good, as Connery. He's got great intensity, a good sense of timing and, well, frankly, he IS Bond.    I very much look forward to the next Bond film and in the meantime highly recommend this one.
0553573403|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, based on reviews and word of mouth.  I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and was hoping this book could fill the void while waiting for the last book to come.  Unfortunately, this book didn't even come close.  George R.R. Martin tries to write a fantasy genre novel, but instead created a filth ridden book that is page after page after page of incest, foul common day language (rather than making it a bit more true to fantasy by creating similar terms for use in THEIR world, not ours), and sexual encounters with children.  The book tries to base it's plot around the courts of the old kings and queens where children were betrothed at an early age.  However, I don't really care to read about the \\"juicy\\" details of how an[...]ld girl can't wait to have sex with her barbarian lover. (Which is explained in detail, much to my dismay).  It takes nearly 550 pages before any sort of action or even adventure (if you could call it that) occurs.  The beginning preface opens with magical white faced creatures slaying travelers in some haunted woods and then sends you on a 500 page jaunt across boring disconnected politics.  The characters themselves have no real connection to the reader.  At this point, I could care less if the characters live or die, or even what happens to the fictional world Martin is trying to create.  Do yourselves a favor, and pass on this book.  If you were expecting a rich, fantasy-laden world with magic and adventure, you'll be severely disappointed.  Instead you will find a terrible excuse for a fantasy book.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|This is a film with an extraordinarily flimsy and unrealistic premise. It violates its own rules and internal logic. It is, essentially, a great big snuff-film.<br /><br />And I really liked it.<br /><br />There's not a lot you can say about this film, really. 42 middle school kids, most of them played by actors who either actually are, or at least look close to, the ages of the characters are hauled out to an island and told to kill each other until only one is left. This is either a reality TV show or government pogrom, or possibly both. Either way, it's an absurd premise.<br /><br />But it works. The acting is very good, and the characters are interesting (plus I really had a thing for Shuya). There's also quite a bit of blood and gore all over the place. Surprisingly, however, there's not as much as you might think. Mostly the shock of it comes not from the quanitity but from the fact that it's 14 - 16 year olds doing the deeds.<br /><br />Ultimately this is a film worth getting. I bought the director's cut from Amazon and I'm quite pleased with it. Even the extras are well done. I would like it if the film got a North American distributor, but that's not likely. So order this version and enjoy.<br /><br />As a side note, I hear there's an American version of the film in the works. Anyone wanna take bets on how badly they'll screw it up? Either we'll have the characters all aged up to college, or at least high school, and likely if they do keep them young, we'll have them played by older actors. Plus you can expect even less realistic violence. But we shall see.<br /><br />Meantime, buy and enjoy this version of a quality film.

0156027321|5.0|\\"The Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel was the Man Booker Prize winner in 2002.  It is a story of Piscine Molitor Patel, son of the local zookeeper, who resides in Pondicherry, India in the late 1970s.  The reader wonders right off the bat how his parents could come up with such an unusual name.  The narrator, Piscine reveals that he was named after a swimming pool in Paris; this name led to much ridicule in school because his name was always mistakenly mispronounced Piss Ing!<br /><br />It was tough on Piscine and he was relieved when a new nickname of sorts (Pi) caught on in school; yes...it has something to do with 3.14!  The novel is so imaginative that it is no wonder that it has hooked readers around the world since it was published in 2002.<br /><br />As much as Pi is one of the major characters; a 450 pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker shares the spotlight and the honors as one of the most interesting animal characters in literature.  How Pi finds himself fighting for survival at sea on a lifeboat with Richard Parker, a hyena, an orangutan and a wounded zebra is one of the most imaginative journeys of survival that I have read.<br /><br />Martel has written that the idea for his novel came from a book review that John Updike did of a novel titled \\"Max and the Cats' which was not well received.  The author was intrigued with India, its animals and religion and all three are woven into the fabric of the novel.  Martel purposely chose an animal local to India for the selection of Richard Parker; the Royal Bengal Tiger and the author visited India multiple times interviewing local Indian zoo keepers.<br /><br />There is much humor in the novel including the segments dealing with Pi's birth name, how Pi found religion (in fact three religions all at once) as well as the origin of Richard Parker's name.  Some readers may find that the book seems very religious to them and in fact Pi is very religious; he joins three (3) religions at the same time (Hindu, Christian, Muslem) and there is a very funny scene at the zoo where the three (3) various heads of the local churches converge on Pi's parents to tell them how devout their boy is.<br /><br />The narrator, Pi, reveals much concerning his spirituality as he discusses life, death, love, fear, despair and hope.  As this bright and resourceful 16 year old Indian boy digs down and finds enough grit to survive at sea for over 200+ days, the reader is rooting for him and for Richard Parker the entire time. There are many shocking elements of survival which are described for the reader which may upset some; but the horrible event of the sinking of the Japanese cargo ship carrying his family to Canada and many of the animals overshadows anything that Pi had to do to survive at sea.<br /><br />There are many beautiful and thought provoking lines in the novel which deal with the many facets of life, the broad spectrum and rainbow of human emotions, and death itself; but one that moved me was when Pi reflected, \\"Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can.\\"  The emotional power of love is what gets Pi through his ordeal.<br /><br />To tell you more would spoil the imaginative journey that the reader will have traveling with Pi and his small ark on his path of survival and growth.  It may take the reader a while to get into the novel at first; but once on the lifeboat...it is a heck of a ride.<br /><br />Very worthwhile read.<br /><br />Bentley/2007<br />[[ASIN:0156027321 Life of Pi]]ry funny scene at the zoo where the three (3) various heads of the local churches converge on Pi's parents to tell them how devout their boy is.

I love the title track, Jeff's voice is better than it's ever been, and it's an emotional record, full of just downright beautiful music.  Also, for the fan who wants \\"rock\\", you've got Walken, Impossible Germany, Shake it Off, what more could you want?  If you've never seen Wilco live, you must, a completed rewarding experience!    You won't hear a lot of the noise that was on the last two Wilco CD's, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or A Ghost is Born (both equally excellent records), this new one is quieter, but the lyrics and musicship are first rate.  Wilco is the BEST american band today!!  Highly recommended!

If they had their way I would be in my grave still waiting for them to reissue the platinum edition. For those of you who are young enough to wait, the wait will be worth it. Last November<br />I turned 80. Disney averages ten or more years re-releasing Snow White and<br />The Seven Dwarfs.
B000P0J024|5.0|Thank you Olivia  for allowing us to see this recording as a work in  progress with the bonus DVD. The DVD that is included with this re-release, watching the \\"brothers\\" work their magic is priceless.  Those of you who are on the fence wondering if this CD/DVD is worth buying, wonder no more. It's awesome.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This film marks a major departure for the James Bond franchise. Although it is difficult to keep continuity in the series after all these decades, this film does not even try. In this one, Bond is freshly promoted to the ranks of the 00 secret agents and his on his first big case.    He is trying to track international terrorism through a money man. This leads him to a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale in Albania.  All is not as it seems, however, there are plots within plots and it is difficult to know who to trust. This is a recurring problem for him.    This Bond film does not rely on all of the techno gadgetry that most of the series do. Instead, it just relies on a hard charging agent who refuses to let the bad guys win. This Bond is not the polished operator one has come to expect from the series. He can be very rough around the edges and needs polishing. It fits in with the story line but I wonder how it will fit in with this Bond in other films, assuming there are more.    Its an interesting film. Not the best and not the worst but worthwhile.    There are a few \\"extra features\\" on a second disk. The first seems like just a promo for the new James Bond and details the casting process. The second was more interesting. It is called \\"Bond Girls are Forever\\" and documents the evolution of the Bond girls from simple cheesecake bimbos to the much more complex characters of later films. I found it interesting.

0060555661|5.0|Everything people have said about how great this book is is true.  It's long, and fairly dense subject matter.  But if you're serious about learning the smartest and least risky  way to invest, this is the book for you.  There are no catch-phrases, no acronyms for \\"proven methods,\\" just straight talk about the methods Graham used in his career.      I came into it with little to no business knowledge, but I felt like everything was explained well enough that even a novice like me could catch up and get something out of it.      Incidentally, a lot of this book fortells doom and gloom for the investor.  It is very difficult to beat the market, and it's better to sit in an index fund rather than to do insufficient research.  Graham views the day-trading short-term investing as \\"speculation.\\"  While you may pick out a couple of winners and make a lot of money with those couple lucky breaks, the odds are that you will lose ghastly amounts doing this kind of investing.  The approach Graham advocates is much more conservative, but a lot smarter too.  Ignore the market analysts and the hot tips, and focus on the business, how it's run, and it's soundness as a long-term investment.      It will take years to see if the methods learned will work for me, but they certainly worked for Graham.  That and the no-nonsense down-to-earth presentation make me eager to learn more and apply the methods discussed.    Lastly, the 2003 commentary updates the 1972 text wonderfully, and shows that Graham's methods are still applicable today, despite the \\"new economic model\\" foretold in the late 1990's.
0312370830|5.0|I'm here in Paris for the summer for an NEH Seminar entitled Visions of the Dark Years:  World War II and its legacy in France, and I'm doing a project on the \\"rafle du Vel d'Hiv\\"- the massive round-up of Jews that took place in Paris on July 16th, 1942.  I purchased this book in French at the bookstore at Le Memorial de la Shoah, not knowing that it had been translated from English. The story is haunting, and interesting, as we follow it in flashbacks.  I am doing an annotated bibliography of books on the subject for my seminar project.  This story will appeal to my younger students, teaching them at the same time of this shameful episode of French collaboration with the German occupiers, under the Vichy government. France was the only occupied European country to pass its own laws regarding Jews, which were even stricter than those of the Third Reich. By looking the other way,and pretending not to know where the Jews were being transported after the local French camps at Drancy and Pithiviers (they were immediately transported to Auschwitz) some 9,000 French police catalogued and arrested over 13,000 French and foreign Jews residing in France, and sent them to the Velodrome d'Hiver, a large stadium in Paris. This is a shameful episode in French history, retold in a poignant and gripping fashion.
0060755598|4.0|The E-Myth is essential business knowledge, and I wish I had had this wisdom 20 years ago. Gerber basically busts the old paradigm that being \\"good\\" at what you \\"do\\" - i.e., being a good \\"technician\\" - is the most important critical factor in having a successful small business.  As Gerber correctly points out, you will crash and burn if you spend too much time working *in* your business and not enough time working *on* your business and seeing it as something separate from yourself.<br /><br />What I found most helpful was his explanation of how having precise and thoughtfully crafted job descriptions and operational methodologies can make all the difference between making true progress and floundering on a day-to-day basis. Likewise that a mission tied to deeply held personal values, understood by *all* persons in the business - top to bottom-, is absolutely necessary. And likewise that clients (in my case) or customers want a consistent, positive experience that meets or exceeds their expectations every time they do business with you, especially if you're in a profession or a service business.  Let me tell you, truer words have not been spoken.  It's news you can use immediately.<br /><br />Gerber reads the E-Myth (unabridged) on this CD set.  His delivery is avuncular and warm, and apart from the \\"pie\\" theme (see below) didn't grate the way many author-read works do. What drove me crazy (and why this is a 4-star instead of a 5 star review) was the conceit of a running dialog between Gerber and a \\"client\\" named \\"Sarah\\" and her floundering small business called \\"All About Pies.\\" The take-away from this is valuable, but cheeze lou-eeze! I kept imagining Jimmy Cagney in Public Enemy, washing the face of his whiny girlfriend with a grapefruit over breakfast, only here, I was rooting for \\"Sarah.\\"<br /><br />I have the book also.  Trust me - go with the CDs.
B00005JPHT|4.0|Moore exposes the human cost of the USA's failed healthcare system: doctors who are paid to deny necessary procedures, 9/11 volunteers who fell between the very large cracks, a cancer patient who had to sell her home and move into a spare room in her daughter's house, thousands of miles away...and in true Moore fashion he bundles a few of these folks off on small boats to Guantanamo Bay-to demand the same free, state-of-the-art healthcare that the Bush-Cheney government repeatedly brags is offered to the prisoners there.<br /><br />Of course, he's turned away there-but finds a very receptive audience within the Cuban medical system, which treats the 9/11 volunteers as true heroes. In a very moving moment, a doctor in Cuba tells Moore that Cuba is a very poor country with few resources, but it has made healthcare a priority for all its citizens-and she pretty much tells him, if we can do it, you can too.<br /><br />Cuba is not the only place that has made healthcare a priority-just about every First World country except the US offers high-quality free or minimal-cost universal healthcare, and Moore documents this with interviews in Canada, France, and England.<br /><br />Less strident and more poignant than in some of his earlier films, Moore has made a film that I think could reach mainstream American audiences and show them it doesn't have to be that way. And why, Moore asks, is \\"socialized medicine\\" such a demonized concept in the US? After all, we have socialized police and fire protection, public education, and plenty more. Why isn't healthcare likewise considered a basic service?
0060763892|5.0|This book is Jim's most well written to date.  Very tightly written with everything having a purpose.  I think the premise was excellent from the beginning (what happened to Marco Polo?) and tied up nicely at the end.  What I like most about Jim's books is that I'm always thinking \\"This could happen\\" (think about the very end of Ice Hunt).  The characters also had more substance and interesting interactions.  The villains were baaaad, almost as bad as his villains in Amazonia.  Great scene near the end between Gray and Seichan - all is not as it seems.    The only thing that might need to be changed is the location of Susan's appendectomy scar.  :)    Nice job, Jim!
B0000025D0|2.0|This was the album that got me to stop buying Springsteen albums.  The first three albums had been great.  Born to Run, the album that preceeded this one, was an absolute masterpiece.  So I had high hopes when I bought Darkness.  They were all dashed.    What happened?  You see these reviews here having orgasms about the angry, harsh attitude of the songs.  Yay.  Notice that nobody talks about the actual *quality* of the music.  After three albums where Bruce evidenced great songwriting skill, coming up with wonderful chord progressions, fantastic song structures with unexpected twists, and really showing off his talented band to good effect, on darkness he regresses to simplistic, boring, utterly predictable 3-chord songs.  For instance, Badlands:  the same ultra-basic 3 chords over and over again, the verse the same as the chorus.  Gee Bruce, what'd it take you, 5 whole minutes to think up that one?  And THAT song is one of the better on the album! (at least the tune is catchy).  There's a few songs which are ok, most are pretty forgettable.    And as for the arrangements and the use of the band, one statistic speaks volumes:  Clarence Clemon's magnificent saxaphone plays for about 24 bars *on the whole album* (three short little 8 bar solos, and that's it!).
B000FUF6QS|4.0|I have seen BOTH versions of this movie and the newest one w/ Nicholas Cage left me empty. The cast was vapid and the whole thing was totally unbeleiveable and silly. It has no message whatsoever! This version has a lot more to offer a thinking audience.        I saw this movie cut down for American broadcast TV. That was what some 20-25 years ago now (I was in high school at the time) and it made a huge impression on me. I always wanted to see this one again so when I finally came across it at the supermarket of all places I bought it right away before the two copies they got in were gone! I also bought this movie to show my husband who is African that white people have their pagan sacrifice and rituals. He really loves this movie too. We have watched it several times over now.        In this version the director really builds the suspense. The first time you really do not know what is going to happen. Imagine my surprise when I saw the UN-CUT version with all of the fertility rituals! The whole film comes together really because of the location and real pagan information the writer used in telling the story as well as costuming, time frame etc. I am not going to explain all the details as (unlike other reviewers) I do not want to give the movie away...You can take away whatever message you retrieve from this film. Really a cult classic! The whole thing will blow your mind.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I can't even explain how I feel about the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtracks, especially the third disc. I can't imagine how someone can be so talented to be able to connect you to the story through this music, I just really can't understand. \\"At Wit's End\\" is definitely a masterpiece, however every single song on this disc, along with all the others are absolutely outstanding. I love soundtracks, but I am aware of Hans's talent, and knowing he was one of the composers of these tracks I knew it would be a win win situation, and I knew I was not to be disappointed. I have never caught myself listening to a soundtrack..over and over.....and over again. Literally, I even watch the movies over and over so that I can listen to the soundtracks on it. Amazing stuff, just like I said, BEYOND WORDS!!
B000NA28IE|2.0|Fifteen year old Christopher Paolini wrote the bestselling novel and adults, who should forever remain nameless, destroyed the movie.  Children and those who have not read the book may enjoy this movie, but having read the book, I know that it pales beside the novel.<br /><br />Paolini's youth can be seen in his writing, his plot is at times clich&eacute;d and often formulaic.  However, having said that, I enjoyed the novel.  Unfortunately I can not  say the same for the movie.  In the novel, Paolini creates a detailed back-story, geography and laws that rule his imaginary world.  (Yes, some of these laws are borrowed from other authors.)  The characters of this world, in comparison to the movie are much fuller and more developed.<br /><br />It is very difficult to take a 750 page novel and adapt it into a 103 minute movie but this movie leaves the essence of novel on the cutting room floor.  People enjoy books and movies if they care about the characters.  While I did care about Eragon in the movie, I cared much less about Brom and Murtagh and their relationship with Eragon is vital to the story.  Other changes that were made were merely annoying.  Arya is an Elf in the novel and that is important to the story.  What is she in the movie?  The military draft subplot is entirely an invention for the movie and is completely unnecessary.  I could go on but I have made my point.<br /><br />Eragon is not fantasy in the class of The Lord of the Rings or The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe but I asked myself, would I have enjoyed this book if I had known nothing about the author?  My answer is yes.  For me his youth only adds to the enjoyment I receive from his work.  To have created a fine story while only a teenager makes me wonder what he will achieve in twenty years.<br /><br />Christopher Paolini is a fine young author and I look forward to Eldest and all his future stories.  Sadly these later books will probably never be made into movies because of the hack job done on Eragon.<br /><br />Recommendation: Read the book, [[ASIN:044023848X Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)]], skip the movie.<br /><br />Kyle Pratttion: Read the book, [[ASIN:044023848X Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)]], skip the movie.

B000G2YD3C|5.0|In their Progression Magazine interview, Pure Reason Revolution say that they try for dark, heavy Pink Floydish washes of sound, combined with light, airy, soaring Beach Boys vocal harmonies.    This is precisely right.    But the band--though it has many influences--is not at all derivative.    The vocals in general and harmonies in particular are thrilling and never overdone.    The melodies are long, complex, and well-thought-out.    The bass is driven and sounds like Chris Squire.    The drumming is relentless and yet modulated and interesting.    All in all, best CD I have heard (prog or non-prog) in quite a while.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|Fairly good alternate history or science fiction in the tradition of \\"1984\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" I agree with some of the posters that I could almost believe that I can see the hero's facial expressions, even through the mask. Ms. Portman proves that she is an actor and wears a shaved head beautifully.    I expected politics in a movie that I knew would focus on human rights, individual liberty and abuse of power. I appreciate the triumph of the human spirit depicted by thousands of individuals and families turning out spontaneously to oppose their oppressors, and agree with the assertion that we are truly free when we are willing to die rather than surrender our liberty. However, the movie could have made these points without the gratuitous portrayal of the \\"conservative and religious\\" leader who hates homosexuals as much as he loves power. All the while, the supposedly religious bad guy blames other \\"religious fanatics\\" for the nation's troubles while banning the Koran and free speech. The point was made very well before the heavy-handed anti-religious viewpoint was revealed time after time in the last half. As the credits roll, we hear that the answer is \\"humanism.\\"
B000P2A24W|1.0|I've been a Bon Jovi fan since the beginning.  My expectations were very low upon hearing they were recording a country crossover cd.      I listened to many cd's in my time by far this is one of the worst in my collection and the worst studio record ever in Bon Jovi's career.      It's very sad to see what this group is becoming.      One song on this cd is ok, that being \\"Memory\\", even this song falls short of the group's best ballads.  I'd give this song a rating of a 6 out of a 10.     As for the other songs (garbage) on this cd they all rate a 1 out of a 10.  I'd give them a 1 just for the effort other than that don't waste your time buying this cd.      This cd is not even GOOD for a country cd.  I can't find anything else on this cd worth listening to only than Memory.     This band needs to realize that they are a rock band!      Look at slippery when wet, how many records did that sell?   Over 10 million?      Fans want that type of music.  They should go back to that style of music.  We've seen glimpses of it with songs like \\"Have A Nice Day\\", Everyday\\" and \\"It's my Life\\".      This cd has no direction other than it belongs in the garbage can.  They should have never released this.  I can't believe how bad the lyrics are and the sound of this cd is awful.      This band seems a lot like Def Leppard these days, once a great melodic rock band now a bubble gum band.      Don't get me wrong I still love this band.  This cd just should have been trashed and started over.       Go back to your roots and give us true rock fans the music we want.  Give us another melodic record!!    Look at their first five records all great, since then they have taken different directions.  At least giving us some good songs on the next records.      Again, this record title sums it up.      They are on a lost highway!      This isn't even close to a ok country record.   They are completely lost somewhere down a highway looking how to make some great music again.
B000N3AWDE|4.0|I will comment on each track individually:    1. ET S'IL N'EN RESTAIT QU'UNE is a very good first track out of the album. I enjoy this one a great deal. It is very modern, and yet, has a flair of POUR QUE TU M'AIMES ENCORE. It reiterates the same topic. The \\"I-would-do-anything-for-you\\"-type of song. Very well written by Françoise Dorin, an author who has illustrated herself over the past 30 years in literature, and in movies as well.    2. IMMENSITE has grown on me. I enjoy this one as well. This is an interesting song written by a young author who specializes in writing on lesbian love. This is a well-crafted song.    3. I really like the beat of A CAUSE. This is a little different for a French song by Celine. Once again, Françoise Dorin wrote it. It almost sounds like a piece taken out of a book. Very well crafted as well, with a nice dance beat.     4. JE CHERCHE l'OMBRE is another nice tune written by Lise Payette, born in Verdun, France but educated in Quebec. Interesting choice of texts since she is known to be a feminist in her own right. This song is anything but. It is well-written. It is a very sensual song, overshadowed by a lot of sincerity meant to denote intimacy in the light of love vs. the strict physicial approach.    5. MES PARADIS is a nice song. The tune itself reminds me of LES DERNIERS SERONT LES PREMIERS from D'eux. It is a nice catchy song. It feels like it's been heard before. This being said, it is a nice song on the feeling of longing for her \\"paradise\\" that she is seeking.    6. LA DIVA is a great song, which I did not know what to do with originally. I always liked Maria Callas. Her voice is so pure to me. I can see why Celine admires her. The track is nice, and could be a single, based on her show on Canadian TV. Celine mentioned that she has always felt a special connection to La Callas. Maybe a movie in the works? The idea is out. She is proving on the last minute of the song, that she may have the chops. The song is about the despair that the Callas felt throughout her life, and how music rescued her from her dark moments. Celine has had a similar path whereby music has \\"saved\\" her from the dull moments of her earlier part of life, where boredom of school set in. Written by Denise Bombardier, a Canadian author.    7. FEMME COMME CHACUNE is one of the songs I like least. The intro reminds me of another song by Celine entitled CHERCHE ENCORE, which has never really been a favorite of mine. Not quite a filler, but just easy to overlook. I don't know the author. This song sounds very French for some reason.    8. SI J'ETAIS QUELQU'UN is an OK song. I don't quite know what to do with this song. Not bad, but I am just on the fence as to liking it. It is a bit dull, and contributes to the CD getting 4 stars.     9. JE NE SUIS PAS CELLE feels like one of Christine Orban. A bit tedious to read with many details. The tune fits to the lyrics, but it is quite boring, and almost depressing. I guess that's what they went for, as it works for that purpose. This reminds me of the song TU NAGES, which is a drag in and of itself (just a personal opinion). It feels like it takes ages to finish.    10. Written by a playwright, LE TEMPS QUI COMPTE reminds me of DESTIN as well. The texture of the lyrics seem to mirror the time spent since D'EUX for some reason. Pretty good soung. More upbeat.     11. LETTRE DE GEORGE SAND A ALFRED DE MUSSET is written by George Sand, a great figure of French literature from the XIX century. It sounds like it's a page of literature that is coming to life. This song, while well crafted lyrically (taken from an actual letter from the author to her lover Alfred de Musset), which means that it almost does not feel like it should be put to a tune. It is working OK though. Not a favorite of mine.    12. ON S'EST AIME A CAUSE is one of my favorite songs on the entire album. It is beautiful, and an extension of track 3 A CAUSE (written by same author). I enjoy listening this song an awfullot. Celine's voice is at its best. It is about the reason why one would fall in love, and fast-forwarding many years, and realizing that the present time requires for love to be established DESPITE many ailments that may have crept into the relationship. It really is a nice reflection on the theory of love and relationships. To me, this song seems to go with MES PARADIS, track # 5 on this album. The progression of these three songs (3,5 and 12) seem to tell a story of their own. Well done.    13. BERCEUSE (lullaby) is an OK song. It sounds like a lullaby too, which is great. Canadian-native Janette Bertrand wrote the song. She is also a comedienne. The only hang-up I have here is that it is hard for me to differentiate this tune from the DIVA song. On that song she mentions being grateful to know the Callas, and that she is the reason why she is on stage, while this one seems to be putting the stress on her life on stage because of her son. It is a bit confusing to me. I know that this is not supposed to be a book, but because the authors are so prominent, I don't seem to be able to separate the two.    So, overall, this is a very good album. My favorite tracks are 1-3, 6 and 12. The least favorite ones are 8, 9 and 11. The others are all good. I think this is a very original concept, which will prove to be another highlight in French music. I would definitely recommend it.

1400079276|4.0|This was my second Murakami book, after The Wind up Bird Chronicles- which I really liked.  Kafka on the Shore was a good read, but I didn't love it.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it stayed a constant &quot;good&quot;...i'd recommend this book though, as it was pretty enjoyable. There are multiple story-lines going on in this book, which are all related in some way. I liked this aspect because it made the book more interesting and had me constantly turning the pages.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|June was a fantastic month for progressive metal.  Symphony X, Kamelot, and Dream Theater all released new albums - in fact the same day for Dream Theater and Kamelot.  (Competition?)  All three releases are very strong, but Systematic Chaos by Dream Theater shows that they are still the kings of progressive metal.  As I have stated before, I only write 5-star reviews, since I can't be bothered to write reviews for anything less.  With this philosophy, I didn't write a review for Octavarium, which was good but not great.  There was nothing on Octavarium that struck me - plenty of prog maybe, but not enough metal.<br /><br />Systematic Chaos isn't quite as heavy as Train of Thought (is anything?), but it certainly is heavy.  The only song not loaded with crunch is \\"Repentance\\", which has a great Pink Floyd feel and is probably the best of the 12 step songs.  \\"Repentance\\" has some beautiful backing guitar and a super solo by John Petrucci.  The album is overall rather dark.  While not a concept album, a number of the songs have lyrics reminiscent of 1950s horror flicks.  \\"Constant Motion\\" is well titled with nothing but pure energy and makes great use of distorted vocals.  Heavy riffs fill \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" from front to back.  The ending, in particular, is exceptionally mean with Petrucci crunching away at the bottom and Rudess going absolutely nuts on top with the continuum - prog metal heaven!  For me, Jordan Rudess does help set DT apart.  Most keyboard players add atmosphere or the lighter touches.  Rudess can do this as well, but he can rip it up as nastily as Petrucci, which is as nasty as it gets.  (They remind me of Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore dueling it out at solo time.)  \\"Forsaken\\" and \\"Prophets of War\\" are short, heavy, and very catchy.  \\"Prophets of War\\" has some Queen-like backing vocals and calls for a change in administration of the US presidency, which I certainly support.  \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is the lyrical standout with a poignant story of successful rescue for the victim while the hero loses his life.  \\"In The Presence of Enemies\\" is the epic piece, beginning and ending the album in grandiose but dark style.<br /><br />Just when I was concerned that Dream Theater was possibly losing their edge, they come back with a bolt of lightning.  I can't wait to see them on tour.  VIP ticket for Cleveland!y of successful rescue for the victim while the hero loses his life.  \\"In The Presence of Enemies\\" is the epic piece, beginning and ending the album in grandiose but dark style.

B00005R1N3|4.0|This is easily one of the most fun horror movies ever, and one of the most frightening. I would have difficulty watching this alone in the dark. I am fine with \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"The Shining\\", \\"Alien\\", and \\"Halloween\\". But not this one. The killer in this movie is too scary. And you hardly ever see him.<br /><br />It's been referred to as the first true \\"slasher\\" movie, although there are more interesting methods of killing here than mere slashing! You can tell that the director really had a good time making this. It shows.<br />It was so innovative, and so influential on the horror movie genre; you've seen it all before in horror films of the 70's, 80's, and 90's... but those movies all copied from this film.<br />\\"Black Christmas\\" includes techniques and concepts that have since become cliche but were original back in 1974: the unseen maniac hiding in the house, camera angles from his point of view, the disturbing phone calls, very minimal but very effective use of creepy background music, and the solitary female survivor who must try to outwit/escape the bloodthirsty, unhinged psychopath.<br /><br />There are some truly scary moments (including those really horrifying schizophrenic phone calls about Agnes), but then there are comedy bits peppered throughout. Today's movie audience might not like this original version because it takes its sweet time, relishing and savoring the dread and suspense until the taut climax.<br /><br />Margot Kidder (Barb) really hams it up playing the brassy, common, boozy, chainsmoking girl. Olivia Hussey (Jess) gives a nice performance. And as her tense pianist boyfriend, Keir Dullea plays the most tempermental musician you'd ever want to meet. I'd never want to be late for an appointment with Peter.<br /><br />The most exciting moment for me is when the cop on the phone tells Jess to just walk out the front door. That's all she has to do. Just take a few steps and escape. (I will write no further, so the ending won't be ruined for those who haven't seen it yet.)<br /><br />...And to all a good night.d to all a good night.

0316067598|3.0|The title of the book creates lofty expectations. \\"Lone Survivor\\"...SEAL teams...Afghanistan. It should be hard-hitting and packed to the gills with action, right? Well, sort of. The book takes a good four chapters to get started. We hear about the author's childhood, his SEAL training days, and how everybody and everything involved with SEALs are amazing -- all before we even get to Afghanistan. Over half the book is spent here.<br />Toss in frequent complaints about 'liberal media\\" and repeated and tiresome complaints about rules of engagement and the book isn't starting off to well.<br /><br />When the team lands in Afghanistan, the tempo picks up. They embark on missions into the mountains, encounter bad guys, and do what SEAL teams do. The story becomes more involved and even a bit suspenseful. When they are tasked with finding and killing a certain bad guy, the book becomes gripping. I couldn't put it down when the SEAL team engaged with the bad guys. The entire firefight section of the book -- which spans multiple chapters -- had me hooked.<br /><br />The book takes a surprising twist in the later chapters of the book -- after the primary firefight. I won't describe the twist but it kept the suspense levels high throughout the remainder of the book.<br /><br />Sadly, the author's writing style wasn't up to the job. While the plot itself was compelling, the author's incessant need to make everything \\"super\\", \\"great\\", \\"amazing\\" or some other synonym was maddening. It sounded like the author was trying to hype up everything and everybody. If there is any organization that does NOT need to be hyped, it is the SEAL teams.<br /><br />Finally, this book has portions that almost sound like propaganda. The author frequent complains about liberal media and how they are on a crusade to \\"get\\" members of the U.S. Military. He complains about media coverage of Abu Gharab (sp) and how the U.S. Military is being forced to fight with one arm tied behind their backs. These types of complaints are sprinkled throughout the book -- which makes them hard to avoid. While the author might have a point, I didn't buy this book to hear his complaints about liberal media -- I wanted to hear about SEAL team firefights in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Overall, the plot was great. The writing style and frequent complaints weren't. Would suggest waiting until the paperback as this story isn't worth the $13-$24.95 hardcover price.oughout the book -- which makes them hard to avoid.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|First, the bad.  This film is really stuck in the 70's.  Muscular violence and anti-corporate propaganda mixed in way guaranteed to sell.<br /><br />That said, it is very well done.  If you want none stop action, romance and intrigue, this your picture.  The techniques used by the sniper teams has been coached by experts.<br /><br />I'll probably buy a previously owned version from local video store.

0316067598|3.0|I love any book about the Navy Seals, Army Rangers, etc. and their remarkable training and operations. I began reading this book at 5 pm and was finished by midnight. A number of reviewers have complained that there are introductory chapters about growing up in Texas and then lengthy history of his SEAL training.  The reviewers are right that these are not the main focus of the book but they are wrong to dismiss them. They are integral to the story and an understanding of the author.  Everything is simply written so you can move briskly through them if you don't want to study them.    Because of my respect for the men and women in the armed forces, I am not going to disrespect the author or his book as a couple of other armchair warrior reviewers have, for the failure of the mission or decisions made along the way.  The book reports a number of life and death decisions and maybe not the ones the armchair warriors would have made but they were not made in armchairs but in some of the most difficult combat conditions one could imagine.     I do caution potential readers in one respect and I do criticize the author in the same respect. As you can tell from other reviews, the author delivers extreme right wing political views.  He speaks with contempt of \\"liberals\\" and the \\"liberal media\\" and \\"Congress\\" because he wants the freedom on the battlefield to use his judgment and kill whoever and whenever he deems it advisable, and he blames these forces for \\"rules of engagement\\" that inhibit that imperative. Moreover, in his narrative, he attributes a critical decision that the team makes to fear of punishment for violating those rules. He believes (with no hard evidence) that this decision leads to the death of his comrades. Unfortunately, military strategy is not designed solely to maximize the interests of the men and women on the battlefield. Often the interests of individual soldiers are sacrificed for the larger goal. It is the acceptance of that risk that makes military service so noble. It is naive to believe that a nation could inspire men and women to service or inspire other nations to ally with it without behaving in a principled manner. Thus we have rules of engagement and we have a civilian government and press that invest in monitoring them for the greater good.  As for the specific incident, it appeared to me that communications failures, the operational failure to have a backup plan for monitoring and checking in with the SEAL team when communications failed and putting the SEAL team in a poor location to begin with, are all more to blame than liberals back home. It is worth noting that today's (7/8/07) NY Times carries a front page story that is closely related to the mission described in this book and provides interesting background to the aborts reported in this book. In contrast, the author goes so far as to state that journalists killed in combat should not be considered as heroes. Frankly, although he is a very zealous patriot, as one would expect and desire in a SEAL, the only parts of America for which he expresses anything positive are (1) Texas and (2) members of the armed forces. He has earned the right to express those views, having made great sacrifices to protect America (as he conceives of it) and I am grateful to him for having protected the rest of us along with that, but he does not appear to have given any thought to his views.  He does not seem to recognize that the weapons he uses and all the resources available to him are supplied by the taxes of hundreds of millions of Americans, most of whom don't live in Texas or presently serve in the armed forces, but sure are helping him survive out there. Although we do not make the same sacrifice as he has made, we are all part of the same team and neither he nor the military as a whole would endure long independent of the rest of us and our principles as he seems to believe. I suspect the vehemence of his views is bound up in some way with the horrible psychic impact of the events he narrates and I wish him a full recovery in that regard and I thank him for his service.

They comfortably fit around one's ears, block most ambient noise (great for airplanes or listening to music/watching movies without disturbing those around you) and also feature a coiled cord. The pads are replaceable, as is the cord itself, which is great for longevity purposes. All in all, a great set of headphones, for most applications and uses ultimately providing for a great value-for-money purchase.
0307383415|5.0|Very few personal narratives develop a theme with such skill.  As Barack Obama describes them, we come to understand his parents & grandparents better than they might have ever understood themselves.<br /><br />When most kids might be shell shocked from a move to Indonesia, he watches and learns.  All around Hawaii he sees the clues to who he is in part.  He spots the racial dynamics of Punahoe and the simple goodness of his grandparents.  A brief visit from his father creates only stress.  When he sees \\"Black Orpheus\\" and his mother's enthusiasm for it, he puts it together and with poetry tells how he feels he, and many others, come into this world.<br /><br />If anyone wonders how \\"organizers\\" spend their days, the Chicago part of the saga describes the work, the volunteers, typical meetings, the organizer culture, etc.  He cuts right through the myths and shows on how the sociology of color creates neighborhoods/living situations that create hard choices for the people caught up in them.  He zeros in on how the brutal past created a psychology that stuns and immobilizes.<br /><br />The \\"dreams/father\\" theme recurs throughout.  He gives the reader glimpses as he gets them, so the reader becomes as curious as Obama.  In Kenya he sees and learns things he could never have envisioned from the US.  The narrative of the Kenyan grandmother is stunning, as are the words on his grandfather's work ID card.  After all the revelations, his summary of what he had seen is again terse and on target: the important history had been discarded, and the wrong history, dysfunctional in the \\"new\\" Kenya, perpetuated.<br /><br />This book is amazing on many levels. I envision it will wend its way to reading lists and pieces of it will be discussed in political science, sociology and psychology as well as literature classes.
B000001ESN|5.0|Apparently we die-hard Rush fans have a little war going on amongst ourselves as to which album is the best Rush album of all time.  Some say Moving Pictures is the pinnacle (myself included) and some say Permanent Waves is clearly the better of the two.  All I have to say about that is 1. Permanent Waves is a great album, hands down and 2. The production of Moving Pictures make it a superior album to Permanent Waves.  Sorry, but it's true.  Now that we have that out of the way, let's move forward to the review of Permanent Waves, one of Rush's greatest albums.  After the excellence of A Farewell To Kings, Rush continued to hone their craft into a more FM radio-friendly sound and Neil Peart continued to create great lyrics along the way.  Short and sweet and to the point, Permanent Waves finds Rush at the peak of their prowess as far as song construction goes.  Let's take a look at the song listing.<br /><br />The Spirit Of Radio -  One of the all-time great Rush tunes along with Closer To The Heart and Tom Sawyer and so many more.  This is awesome.  A nod to the greatness of radio as a whole and the freedom of musical expression without compromising integrity for financial gain.  The clever homage to Simon & Garfunkel's \\"The Sound Of Silence\\" is great and most people don't notice it.  S&G: \\"...the words of the prophet are written on the subway walls...tenement halls!\\"  Rush: \\"For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall....concert hall!\\"  Both great songs.  One of Rush's best.<br /><br />Freewill - Another killer tune.  Freewill was a live stape for years and years.  A host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance.  Neil's lyrics shine here.  Perfect.<br /><br />Jacob's Ladder - A brooding, moody epic tune.  Again, Neil's lyrics are inventive and clever.  Alex wails here.  An often-overlooked song.<br /><br />Entre Nous - Middle of the road Rush.  If Permanent Waves has a weak link, this would be it along with the next tune.  This song isn't terrible in any way, it just doesn't have the punch of the earlier tunes.<br /><br />Different Strings - Much like Cinderella Man from their previous album, Geddy wrote the lyrics here.  This song starts out slow and light and pretty much stays there.  Geddy isn't a bad lyricist, he's just not Neil Peart.  The diet coke of Rush, just one calorie, not Rush enough.<br /><br />Natural Science - I was delighted when they started to do this song live a some of years back.  It's always been one of my favorites.  In the same vein as Cygnus X-1 and the latter The Camera Eye, Natural Science is one of the multi-part mini-concept songs that Rush was so good at creating.  Computerized clinic, for superior cynics, who dance to a synthetic band... Awesome!<br /><br />All in all, Permanent Waves is a great album.  Entre Nous and Different Strings and its production keep it from being as truly great as Moving Pictures, but it is very close.  Always one of my favorites, you wouldn't go wrong starting out here if you were new to Rush.  If you are an old fan like me, it's clearly one of their best efforts!<br /><br />Dig it!have the punch of the earlier tunes.

B00005ATQ9|5.0|It took a few viewings of Barry Lyndon for me to really grasp it, but then again, this is just like every other Kubrick movie.    By the time I accepted the slow, methodical nature of Kubrick's direction, along with the 3 hour running time, I began to realize what makes this movie arguably Kubrick's finest.    Simply put, Barry Lyndon is the most beautiful film that I know of, and I've seen many films at this point.  No hyperbole, no exaggeration.  This movie is gorgeous, and that is a severe understatement.    There are scenes in this movie that will move you to tears, they are so beautiful.  The stunning lighting (and you can read about how Kubrick managed this elsewhere online), the lavish and overwhelmingly complex sets and costume designs, the use of incredible classical music, the ever-present brilliance of Kubrick's direction: this movie is truly an auteur at his most self-indulgent.  I mean, really, the colors that Kubrick captures are mind-boggling; so many awe-inspiring uses of purple and orange and blue...it left me speechless.  Some may frown upon an artist catering to that kind of self-indulgence, but for those like me, you will welcome an artist who has given full-reign to his/her imagination and has the talent to make it happen.    Of course, it is easy to overlook the many other fabulous aspects of this film.  One thing that is often overlooked in Kubrick films is the phenomenal acting abilities he managed to get out of his actors, and the emotional depth that he captures (while constantly being criticized as cold and unemotional).  To those who hold this opinion, I would ask that you witness Ryan O'Neal's heartbreaking performance as Barry Lyndon.  He is wonderful.    While 2001 and Dr. Strangelove may vie for the best of Kubrick's unmatched career, and while I am partial to 2001's magnificence and inimitability, the objective observer in me must admit that Barry Lyndon, while certainly Kubrick's most underappreciated film, is probably his best.  Stay awake!!, and you'll be treated to some fabulous performances and scene after scene filled with images that will be burned into your brain.
B000001ES9|4.0|Take away Neil Peart and what do you have?  Rush on their debut album with Tommy Bolin lookalike John Rutsey (RIP) on drums.  Here is the first expression of Alex and Geddy that we were allowed to hear and it was pretty straight-forward rock.  Nothing spectacular?  In places.  Geddy's voice was something that took a bit of time to get used to.  Alex throws out great solos and rocking riffs.  Altogether a tight rock band from Toronto.  The absence of Neil Peart is elemental and colossal.  But Rush, heavily influenced by Led Zeppelin, showed that they could rock out.  Here are the songs:<br /><br />Finding My Way - A long-time Rush live staple.  This song is a non-stop rockfest.  Geddy and Alex groove together.  Rutsey is middle of the road.  Ooh yeah!<br /><br />Need Some Love - The aspect that Neil brought to Rush is apparent in his absence.  There are a lot of I-need-a-chick songs.  Kinda juvenile.  This song is good.  The lyrics are way corny. Alex shreds.<br /><br />Take A Friend - Weird fade in.  Second time they did this in just three songs.  Hmmmm.  The nostalgia that this album musters makes me like this song.  There was never a really bad Rush song, just some that weren't all that good.  Take A Friend grows on you.<br /><br />Here Again - A long song that reminds me of latter Zeppelin of which I'm sure was influenced by early Zeppelin.  It drags just enough to make me not listen to it very often.<br /><br />What You're Doing - The riff is infectious.  Alex could lay down the boogie.  I like the way Geddy sings it with heart.  This is definitely one of the better tunes on the album.<br /><br />In The Mood - Another Rush staple.  They have been doing this song live for more than 30 years.  You can't help but appreciate its simplicity and its rocking goodness.  Great tune.  Again, the lyrics are juvenile. A Rush song about sex?  Hilarious.<br /><br />Before And After - This song is very mature for being on their debut.  Probably one of the most obscure Rush songs ever.  I think it's pretty rocking after the elongated intro.  Not one of my favorites and definitely not going to be one of yours.  Still pretty solid.  Alex tears it up during the solo.<br /><br />Working Man - One of my favorites.  This song is killer.  The heavy, grinding riff is perfect.  Great ender for the album.<br /><br />Overall, Rush hadn't pulled themselves away from the popular rock bands of the time (Zeppelin) as far as sound went.  They were young and inexperienced and they lacked a certain sense of direction.  Geddy and Alex were great musicians and John Rutsey was solid but typical(especially when compared to his replacement, Peart).  What would have happened to Rush had not Neil Peart entered the band is up for debate, but it wouldn't have been pretty.  A solid rock effort for the time built around wailing Geddy vocals and wailing Alex licks.  One of the greatest debuts of all time?  No.  The true birth of Rush would be on Fly By Night.  Still a bunch of great songs on here!<br /><br />Dig it!ated intro.  Not one of my favorites and definitely not going to be one of yours.  Still pretty solid.  Alex tears it up during the solo.

B000002NFM|5.0|Bursting onto the scene in early 90's/late 80's, Prodigy have been known to dabble into a smorgasboard of electronic music styles.  They never stuck to one type of electronic style in their career, and that's just dynamite.  But whatever they do, they never fail on one thing: To Deliver an attitude.  Yeah, the earlier stuff really doesn't have as much, but The Fat Of The Land does.  It's in your face.  It has hard beats.  The sampling has nothing to do with catchy pop melodies.  So expect not a lot of catchy, tasty melodies.  Do however, expect dirt.  Lot's of it.<br /><br />Prodigy at it's heart, is a dance group.  But it extends beyond that.  Take a time to relax as you get lost in the etheral vocals in Narayan and Smack My ______ Up (the middle part, at least). Climatize, well there really isn't much I could explain, but that one requires a listen in the dark with headphones to consume you (at least the beginning, even it's Tangerine Dream-lite).  Lot's of the songs have interludes that pump you, make you relax, and make you slam yourself.  Besides, with Keith Flint's snarling vocals, this stuff is in your face get the ______ out of my way(Firestarter! Yeah!).  It never gets old.<br /><br />The Fat Of The Land has the snarling attitude down pat.  Like I said before, the music isn't poppy.  This isn't Daft Punk.  Nearly ever song on here has a pumping beat, Breath will go into the ground.  Diesel Power has a bit of an industrial feel, featuring Kool Keith.  Aside from Climatize, there isn't much relaxation.  It does however, grow on you, and the melodies still are great.  They just don't sound like Darude or Daft Punk's Discovery.<br /><br />So electronic music fans who only prefer Oakenfold and poppy techno may not like it.  Buuut, well there isn't much to say on taste.  However, if you are looking for attitude and slamming breakbreaks, there's no question you should look into it.<br />10/10
B000002HEP|5.0|OK, just so you know where i'm coming from, i'm a huge be-bop jazz and classical music fan and i think Zeppelin, Kiss and Queen just plain SUCK (yeah yeah, write me nasty email, see if i care)    I *DO* like Motorhead and the Ramones a lot though    and i LOVE Kyuss. of their three CDs (Blues for the Red Sun, this one and ...and the circus leaves town) this is probably my favorite because it's a bit more daring    THese guys were just wonderful, loud as hell, grungy thrashing pounding slamming over the top but with some with and cleverness and NONE OF THE POMPOUS B.S. you find with most metal/loud bands: no big hair, no makeup, no skin tight clown outfits, no lame overtly sexual lyrics, no fire eating or hanging from wires when they played, etc.  Just guys doing it really well    Sonically i think my aforementioned faves Motorhead and the Ramones are probably the best reference points here. Kyuss was simple, stripped down, bass heavy.    This album basically has 3 songs - they are 'suites' made up of several songs that run into each other. while they grind out some hot effin' riffs and can run full tilt at fast tempos, they also catch you off guard now and then by slowing it down or setting the song up with a quiet-ish, slow-ish intro that suddenly explodes into high volume
B00005JPHT|5.0|This is less about pointing fingers than it is about working together to resolve this situation in America today.  By sticking (for the most part) to that premise, and not blaming one party or the other, Moore comes up with a film that everyone should see.<br /><br />It is time for Americans to demand a change in our healthcare system. No, not by saying it is important to us, not by writing it on the internet. It takes more of a revolution than that. We are all going to have to demonstrate, visibly, whatever it takes, that we will only elect a President and legislators that have a concrete plan to provide a system of healthcare in this country that is similar to the rest of the western world. And that means that doctors will need to go to work for the healthcare system, and medical insurance companies will need to close their doors and distribute their shareholders' equity to the shareholders. Perhaps they can pony some of it up to a National Healthcare Fund before they go.<br /><br />I don't pretend to understand all the economic ramifications, the project of transforming the system from private to public. That's what I elect all those people to figure out. A better day is coming. It has to.<br /><br />In Michael Moore's past films,he spent too much time on himself and his sarcasm in the films, substituting his political beliefs sometimes for his judgement as a filmmaker. Thus, he was destined to polarize a lot of potential viewers.<br /><br />I saw \\"Sicko\\" today, Moore's film about healthcare in America. As for pointing a political finger,  he chose not to blame one political party or another ... oh, there are a couple of Bush jokes and one poke at Hillary, but for the most part, what Moore was trying to express was, with our deep-seated fear of socialism, we have allowed a corrupt and ineffective system of healthcare and health insurance to permeate (and in many families' cases, nearly destroy) our country's way of life.<br /><br />The plight of many who have suffered in the American healthcare system is staggering, and sad. Moore tells his story through a series of vignettes, and chooses NOT to discuss the most obvious issue - those who have NO healthcare insurance. Instead, he focuses on the issues faced by those who DO, or who can apply. Most of the issues, portrayed in the first half of the film deal with those who cannot get a policy because of pre-existing conditions (e.g., those who are the sickest, those who have the most debilitating diseases, who need healthcare the most) and cannot get covered. I'm lucky. My employer takes all employees and their dependents into the policy at 90 days, with or without pre-existing conditions. Most do not.<br /><br />Then there is the matter of what is covered, and what is not covered. Moore shows the plight of a 50 something couple (he's had three heart surgeries, she's a cancer survivor). They've been bankrupted just by co-pays and deductibles and are forced to live in a small room with their daughter. He shows the fate of a man who is the spouse of a healthcare worker at a large Midwestern hospital....his brother has been diagnosed as a perfect candidate to donate bone marrow to prevent his death from kidney cancer, but the hospitalization policy won't pay for the surgery. You can guess what happens to the man with cancer. Throughout this series, he points out the issues with the big insurance companies (also including some very difficult to deal with situations where their employees who have to deny care try to cope with the blame they lay on themselves), the big pharmaceutical companies, the employers who are trying to cut costs and specify the terms of the plans, the legislature, the past attempts by executives to do something about it, and the general malaise in government about the situation. This is strong stuff. It is nothing we don't know, but to see it assembled here, in essay format, is to feel some of the shame and sense of hopelessness we have all faced when friends,relatives or we, ourselves, struggle with healthcare and its costs. To wonder where America took the wrong turn, the wrong fork in the road.<br /><br />Moore moves into the danger of socialized medicine by showing some of the rhetoric we have been subjected to in the US about how bad the system is. He points out that our healthcare system is ranked 37th in the world, just above Slovenia's. He lets us visit the healthcare system in Canada, Britain and France, to make the contrast between their government systems and our startlingly inept private system. The biggest laugh in the film is found here, when we learn why the British hospital has a cashier's desk. (No spoiler, go see it!)It is at this point that the realization hits home. In contrast to those in friendly democratic and quasi-friendly, quasi-socialist western companies..... well, we suck at this.<br />And that, my friends, is the message. Through our shame and our ineptitude, we have allowed the most important elements of our society, our people, to suffer. We have used our tax dollars unwisely, we have had the wrong social priorities, and we must change it. NOW.<br /><br />Moore's film is not without its stunt. And even if you recognize it for the stunt it is, even if you know that what you see on camera was somewhat staged, you can't help but break down. This is the controversial scene where Moore learns that we have universal healthcare for the inmates at Guantanamo, so he takes some EMT volunteers from the 911 cleanup effort, who have become very sick, and a few others from the film, by boat, to Guantanamo. They can't get it to get free healthcare. So, he takes them to a free clinic/hospital in Cuba, and everyone receives some of the help they needed that they couldn't get in America.  And a tribute is made by Cuban firefighters to some of these unsung heroes of 911.<br /><br />The film is grainy, has some inserts of scenes from the 40's and 50's that are hokey, there is still too much Michael Moore. I'm sure there are things that are inaccurate.  I'm told that the wait times to see doctors in many universal healthcare systems are appalling, but by and large, you can see that we have allowed our own system to erode appallingly, in this film.....but it is much more than just a film. It is a wake up call. So join me, go see it. Wake up. This is one of the greatest countries in the world. It's time we got our priorities straight and started acting like it.with healthcare and its costs. To wonder where America took the wrong turn, the wrong fork in the road.

It is a wake up call. So join me, go see it. Wake up. This is one of the greatest countries in the world. It's time we got our priorities straight and started acting like it.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Two Weeks Notice starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant is a cute and safe romantic comedy. There are some funny scenes in this film but of course the chemistry is awkwardly steamy. Grant always seems lazy in the love department, his chemistry with Drew Barrymore in Music and Lyrics is on the breezy side as well. Bullock's appeal saves this film, the scenes where she is ordering gallons and gallons of chinese food is a riot. This film is an office romance so it does have some orginality to it but otherwise it's pretty much a standard love story. Two Weeks Notice is worth a notice or two though. Enjoy!

1400032717|5.0|What Mark Haddon was able to accomplish in this book is truly amazing! His ability to \\"get into\\" the mind of a young adult with Asperger's Syndrom is astounding.    This was one of the first books I picked up to read after my son was diagnosed with AS. I was happily surprised by the depth of the main character and Haddon's ability to share his protagonist's thought processes. I sincerely appreciate Haddon's dedication to authenticity.     If you know someone with Asperger's Syndrome or just want to learn a little more about how someone with AS might perceive the world--don't pass this book up! Not only is it very insightful, but it is a tremendous read, too.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|That's about the highest praise I can muster for this effort.  It isn't that it's BAD, but it just never achieves \\"lift off.\\"    I wish I could wax enthusiastic, but after quite a few listens at this point, I don't think my opinion is likely to change appreciably.    Time for Ms. Jones to find her passion.  It isn't evident on this CD.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I've only seen the standard-definition BBC version of this, so I can't compare it with Sigourney Weaver's narration, but I'll say this much: The money and time they spent on this documentary is right there on the screen.  It's simply the most captivating nature series I've seen.  I particularly liked the introductory episode, \\"From Pole to Pole,\\" as well as \\"Mountains,\\" \\"Shallow Seas,\\" and \\"Ice Worlds.\\" The episode \\"Great Plains\\" was also very educational about the importance of grass in our world.  I plan on seeing this series in high definition, for sure.  David Attenborough's commentary is very good, although the repeated use of superlatives to announce a particular sequence gets a bit tiresome periodically. (How many \\"greatest spectacles\\" can one planet have?)  They're even occasionally contradictory: Both freshwater rivers and glaciers are touted as the \\"most erosive force on the planet.\\"  This isn't really a gripe, however, just an observation.  I spent many happy hours in rapt attention watching this series and expect I will rewatch it many times.  I particularly liked the understated subtlety about the importance of conservation and respect for wilderness.  Only two or three times in the course of nearly 10 hours of programming was a comment fairly blunt about global warming or destruction of habitat.  Sometimes you really don't need a sledgehammer to make a point, and \\"Planet Earth\\" achieves this brilliantly.    As I've only seen the standard DVD release, I'm shocked that the high-definition version doesn't include the \\"Planet Earth: Diaries\\" segments included at the end of each episode of the standard version.  The behind-the-scenes looks at the filming challenges, detailing what these filmmakers had to endure (solitude, endless boredom waiting for an animal, travels to incredibly remote places, polar bear attacks, grappling with emotion at seeing the wrath of nature firsthand, etc.) were so enjoyable... I was very much surprised to learn they weren't partof the HD version.  The \\"Planet Earth: The Future\\" disc five in the standard release is something I could take or leave.  It was a nice addition, but not integral to the series.  In my opinion, the \\"diaries\\" were, and it's a shame they were omitted.    Some day in the future, there will doubtlessly be an even more encompassing nature documentary series.  Technology will continue to evolve and the HD of today will look like a stepping stone.  Until then, though, this is the standard.  Whatever comes along to eclipse this series will have to be stunning in the extreme.  \\"Planet Earth\\" has set the bar very high indeed.    Add my voice to those who are annoyed that people order the wrong version of this series, then give the program itself a poor rating because THEY made a mistake.  I can honestly understand some people being confused at DVD vs. HD-DVD (many people are just not technically minded, and I've talked with people who incorrectly think that DVD is a high-definition format by its very nature), but in my mind, the rating system is for the content itself, not for exacting revenge due to one's technical ineptitude or a poor experience ordering from Amazon.

B00006J3WH|4.0|In all honesty, this is a fun CD. Maybe these aren't all professional singers, and maybe some of them have some pretty awful voices (some have lovely ones, though. Let's remember that), but listening to this CD brings back the images from the episode. They're catchy songs, easy to listen to and sing along. Some are better than others, some are silly (\\"The Mustard\\" and \\"The Parking Ticket\\" just make me laugh, but aren't really that important...), and some give me a momentary spasm of pain (\\"Dawn's Lament\\", nasal and painful - good thing the ballet piece is so nice it drives this out of your mind).<br /><br />I think this is probably only good for fans of the show. I can't see some random person who has no previous love of the episode wanting these songs. They aren't of high quality. They're simply enjoyable for those who love the episode and want the option to sing along and have fun to it. It's a great CD - for some people.<br /><br />But then you hit the end. Three spectacular tracks that, if you ask me, are what make this CD actually worth it. In addition to the songs from \\"Once More with Feeling\\", we get three scores.<br /><br />The first suite is from another great episode: \\"Restless\\". Here, each theme comes out solidly. \\"Willow's Nightmare\\" is a creepy, confusing, sort of Middle-Eastern piece with a very nice feel to it, all taken straight from the episode, bringing to mind the wonderful images. The rest of the suite brings together creepy, intriguing singing and lovely sounds that end with the images fresh on your mind. The very ending is perfect - you can almost hear the words from the episode hiding behind the music, barely spoken and breathed aloud. \\"You think you know. What's to come. What you are. You haven't even begun.\\" A perfect atmosphere and beautiful music with it.<br /><br />Next, we're presented with a suite from the incredible episode \\"Hush\\". Each moment brings to mind matching scenes from the episode. There is the perfect air of mystery, fear, and that eerie sense of something creepy about to happen. There's the sort of choir-like moment, blending into the lovely, romantic \\"First kiss\\" part, and ending on a wholly creepy and terrifyingly wonderful note. A superb episode has this excellent score to add to its wonder.<br /><br />Finally, we're presented with the incredible \\"Sacrifice\\", from the episode \\"The Gift\\". This is the direct piece used in that incredible episode and it's impossible to listen to it without feeling your heart move. If there was ever a better piece to put on a CD of Buffy music, this is it. You can see everything that happens, and it's just so perfect and complete you can almost cry. The whole piece is just bound to give you chills and bring back those wonderfully painful memories from the episode.<br /><br />Honestly, while I do love \\"Once More with Feeling\\" and the great, fun songs it has, I find that I play the orchestral pieces here much more often than the others. It's those pieces that invoke the great memories and bring tears to my eyes. They're inexplicably powerful in a way that only one song of the musical can match (\\"Under Your Spell/Standing (Reprise)\\", without a doubt one of the best songs of the musical). The songs you can get in the episode. The suites are less accessable. I'd opt to buy this just for that.<br /><br />In summary: No, this isn't spectacular. It's not of extremely high quality. But it's fun and any Buffy fan can appreciate it. Overall, it's great to sing along to, and the scores and suites are a HUGE bonus. Certainly recommended to all fans of the show, but perhaps not to others who can't quite understand all of the jokes and humor.<br /><br />But I still wish for some more suites...g creepy about to happen.

1594489505|3.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns was a solid piece of writing and worth the read.  However, it lacked the nuance of The Kite Runner and felt asthough a non-Afghani / American who had been attuned to / or observing the past 15 years of Afghanistan politics & culture could have written it.   The Kite Runner gave us a peek into a world we knew existed but never got to view.  This book gives us views into a world we knew existed and have gotten to look into.  I had hoped for more than that and was disappointed.  Readers who did not have the high expectations that I did will be less so.

1416524800|4.0|I can tell how good a book is going to be by the prologue or reading the first page of the chapter. The prologue did it for me. That was some  beginning....<br /><br />This book is just over 700 pages. I purchased it at 4:30 p.m. and had it finished by midnight. Yeah I know---but really I'm just a good reader. I couldn't put the darn thing down!  This book is great. The story IS believable too and that's what makes it all the more great.<br /><br />I did NOT expect the villain to be who it turned out to be, in fact I expected it to be someone else---close to the President. Score one big one for Dan Brown for the shock factor!<br /><br />I'm funny about two things--movies and books, and I won't watch just any movie that comes out and I won't read just any book. This book kept me on the edge of my seat throughout and I must say I started asking myself a lot of questions. How far would a person go to get what they want....to keep things the way they are....nothing surprises me when it relates to politics BUT this book, the idea of what they did is so damn believable....not that the exact same thing could happen now but...there are a lot of conspiracies about government hoaxes...what if...?<br /><br />Anyway, if you love suspense and intrigue you'll love this book!
B000J233SK|5.0|This music is great for traveling far and wide. The music is both imaginatively and intellectually stimulating. This is an album that calms me, comforts me, and soothes the depths of my soul. Loreena is such a magnificent vocalist and the music that she creates I will never forget. The \\"Book of Secrets\\" was the first album of hers that I listened to and bought. I just so happened to stumble upon a copy in a public library and checked it out because I was intrigued by the neat cover art. Well, sweet fortune drew me to her, and ever since, she has been one of my favorite artists to listen to. I would rate her among the top five I have ever heard. I thank God from bringing her to me. One day, I will surely live to travel to see her live in concert. I must do it before I die!
B000H5U65C|5.0|I've listened to this album hundreds of times and still get excited when it comes up in the CD changer. I can't imagine taking it out anytime soon. It's probably their most solid effort top to bottom and that's saying a lot after their previous release established them among metal's elite.    One of the most noticeable differences between this and Leviathan is the improved production quality. Brann's drumming sounds absolutely fantastic and the vocals are leaps and bounds beyond previous efforts. Though they may have signed with a big name label, the composition is just as intricate and interesting as you'd expect.     They again take the concept album approach and execute it flawlessly. This time instead of being at sea, we're climbing up blood mountain, trying to bring the crystal skull to the top at the gods' request. The lyrics as well as the music lay out the story in grand Greek myth style fashion. It's much more linear in nature then Leviathan's attempt to retell Moby Dick. There's a definite beginning, middle, climax, and conclusion (the breathtaking Pendulous Skin). Our hero - who's a werewolf - begins his journey by searching in a cave for the crystal skull, then continues up the mountain-side facing ogres, avalanches, starvation, and his own personal fears, only to reach the top and head back home. A truly epic journey that I think warrants a visual representation as well.    I highly recommend this to those who appreciate fine musicianship.
B00005JPQT|4.0|This movie was everything I hoped it would be. Some movies I see the trailer and thats all that was good about the movie, but not this film. Hell, I saw it twice. The PG-13 rating kind of made me rethink seeing it but I did anyways.  There was a couple behind me who wouldnt shut up all the way thru it, but I still enjoyed it. A few parts didnt really fit with the story, but im not a nerd who picks at those kinds of things. Its a great addition to the series. John may be older and swear less, but the action is really heavy and there are a few good laughs thrown in. The best action movie of the year so far and probably all year.     I also want to predict something. When this movie comes out on dvd, it will probably be given the unrated edition. I honestly dont know what they could add to the movie, it was perfect the way it was.
B000002UB6|3.0|The heavy black border on the front cover, the inexplicable reversion by the band members to \\"younger\\" looks, the red apple label, the \\"new phase Beatles album\\" line on the back cover, all played their part in confusing one particular 13-year-old upon this album's release. It would only be about five years later, once the Beatle literature began to proliferate in earnest, that I comprehended the situation behind what many commentators bemoaned as a painfully weak finish to a spectacular musical career, indeed epoch. All these years later I still find myself agreeing that it was a shame the Beatles didn't keep this one in the vault and let Abbey Road stand as their true swan song.    Overall, though, Let It Be really does little to tarnish the Beatles' reputation. There are small pleasures here that stand the test of time better than some of the Beatles' more grandiose efforts. \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"Get Back\\" can proudly take their place among the best of Lennon-McCartney, and even the overproduced \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" still have a haunting melodic beauty.    And the Beatles, being the Beatles, didn't leave this without an odd wrinkle or two in the backstory. For one thing, this is the album for which the final Beatles recording sessions were conducted. Absent John, the rest of the group convened sometime after Abbey Road was put to bed to record George's \\"I Me Mine\\", which was featured in the Let It Be film, but only in rough form. They also put some finishing touches to the title track. These sessions were conducted in January 1970, which gave the Beatles the barest toehold as a working group in the new decade. The initial release of the album also reportedly featured a book of photos that one commentator described over thirty years ago as \\"useless\\", though I've never seen that book and would very much like to, if only to say I did.    And there is this: the album is entirely free of even the barest hint of the sometimes painful tensionon display in the film. I'm not sure what that means, except that they obviously had moments even at this nadir when they could rally and make the magic happen.
1401302378|5.0|This is a great book! The subtitle is: why the future of business is selling less of more - the niche markets, and refers to the long tail found in a stats graph, where you have the bell portion pushed to the left (representing the majority or more popular items) and then a long tail that goes on exponentially - never getting to zero. We, as consumers, have more choices and by having more choices what we choose will have more outcomes. For example, he talks about when he (and myself) were growing up in the 70's only had 3 or 4 TV stations to choose from, so we all watched the same thing. Now, we have 100 TV stations, movies on TV and DVD and the internet to take our time in the evening - so instead of 3 or 4 stations vying for our attention to get the largest share of the viewers (say 30%), there are hundreds of ways to spend our time so the viewership will never probably be that high again. So looking at a graph, there are the few shows that get a good share of the viewership, but if one was to poll everyone to see what they watched, the choices would be almost unlimited - the long tail. What he is getting at is the niche markets - markets that are so small that they never existed before mostly because they were cost prohibited. Now however, because of the internet (no brick/morter buildings to support and depending on the product, no product to house) people can offer more choices and at a reduced cost. One example of this is iTunes. Apple has no CDs to store - just tunes (or audiobooks) on servers, so they can store tunes that are popular just as easily as tunes that are less popular. What is amazing is that every one of their 1 million tunes has been purchased at least once. Traditional stores could not justify shelf space for an item that just sold once or twice a year, but a virtual store can. And the non-traditional stores find that having more alternatives creates a market of alternatives, doesn't matter what the atlernative is - music, videos, books - thereis a market for it all, albeit a small market, but alot of small markets add up to a large market. He talks of companies that created markets - Sears and Robuck, amazon, Apple, Netflix, Rhapsody. He also talks about people who created their own market because of their ability to be producers - creating something, putting it on the Internet, and gaining a following - some later go on to create things for money, as in bands who first post music they created, mixed and posted all from their home computer and then sells singles or I was thinking of the person who has a blog and goes on to create a blook, self-published by Lulu, sold on Amazon, wins a Blooker award and is hyped on NPR - which creates more demand. This happened with Colby Buzzell's My War:Killing Time in Iraq. As the cost of doing business, creating a market goes down, and becomes more available to more people, creating more choices, more niche markets are created. The more niche markets, the traditional markets find themselves less powerful. Some adapt others don't. And we know that someone/something doesn't adapt to new surroundings they cannot survive and I believe that is what we are seeing in TV today - especially the big 3 scrambling for the viewership numbers that no longer exists. We all see the adds for Netflix and iTunes, but until I read this book, I never realized how great their influence was!

And Will Ferrell is....you know..Will Ferrell. Now the movie is broken down like this, Will is the tax man or what i like to call public enemy #1,Emma Thompson is the writer, Latifah is the assistant, Maggie Gyllenhaal is his love interest,and Dustin Hoffman is the professor that is going to help the tax man out of the dilemma of being the main character in the writer's final book. The writers story is a reflection of his life, and every word she writes, every scene she creates, happens in his life. Talk about the pen is mighter than the sword!

B000TBKHNU|5.0|Lively, ambitious, almost entirely successful debut album, made up of keyboard-dominated instrumentals (\\"The Barbarian,\\" \\"Three Fates\\") and romantic ballads (\\"Lucky Man\\") showcasing all three members' very daunting talents. This album, which reached the Top 20 in America and got to number four in England, showcased the group at its least pretentious and most musicianly -- with the exception of a few moments on \\"Three Fates\\" and perhaps \\"Take a Pebble,\\" there isn't much excess, and there is a lot of impressive musicianship here. \\"Take a Pebble\\" might have passed for a Moody Blues track of the era but for the fact that none of the Moody Blues' keyboard men could solo like Keith Emerson. Even here, in a relatively balanced collection of material, the album shows the beginnings of a dark, savage, imposingly gothic edge that had scarcely been seen before in so-called \\"art rock,\\" mostly courtesy of Emerson's larger-than-life organ and synthesizer attacks. Greg Lake's beautifully sung, deliberately archaic \\"Lucky Man\\" had a brush with success on FM radio, and Carl Palmer became the idol of many thousands of would-be drummers based on this one album (especially for \\"Three Fates\\" and \\"Tank\\"), but Emerson emerged as the overpowering talent here for much of the public.
B00000K19E|5.0|What's this? A fast-paced, intense sci-fi action movie with a brain, amazing special effects, well-developed characters, a cool soundtrack, and so many unforgettable quotes I don't even know where to begin? Yeah, that's what you're lookin' at. Oh, and there are a lot of big explosions. Don't worry about that.<br />I assume you've heard of this movie's special effects - the time control thing Neo (the hero) and the Agents (the villians) do is awesome. Without giving too much away, I will say that the movie's worth seeing for the subway fight between Neo and Agent Smith (or ONE of the Agent Smiths, at least) alone. Actually, the action scenes in general are worth watching the movie for alone - the airport fight, the opening scene with Trinity (a woman in a resistence force against the Matrix - I'll get to that), the rooftop fight between Neo, Trinity and the Agent Smiths (AKA the \\"Dodge this\\" scene), the simulated battle between Morpheus and Neo, and of course the last fight in the movie are great. Whoa...<br />But it's not all just action: the movie presents a number of fairly deep-thinking situations(though I'll admit none of them are original): would you rather be safe or free; you are who you make yourself; the only limits are the ones you set (there is no spoon!), etc. I don't really have that many movies (music being my wife and life), but I don't think many high-speed thrillers with lots of guns and lots of karate even try to appeal to the brain. This one does.<br />Now, a bit of background - don't worry, I won't give away the ending if you're one of the two people who hasn't seen this movie. Thomas Anderson (AKA Neo) is a hacker who thinks there's something in this life he's not picking up. What he discovers from Morpheus (who has got to be my favorite character in this movie) is that around the turn of the 21st century, machines overcame humans as a result of a war that ravaged the landscape. The humans were all put in sort of pods, I guess you'd say, sleeping, believing they were going about their daily lives as usual. But this was just a computer program, called \\"The Matrix\\". Morpheus leads a small band of people who have been \\"awoken\\" (this band includes Trinity and, eventually, Neo), and have taken it upon themselves to inform as many people as possbile about the truth behind the Matrix. Neo joins the resistance, and is trained in karate and such. Here he learns that the Matrix, like all computer programs has rules. And according to Morpheus, \\"Some can be bent, some can be broken\\" - this explains the movie's famous time-freeze slow-mo double flying side kick thing - after all, they are opposed by Agent Smith, a sentient program that can manifest itself as any member of the Matrix and is represented by a clean-shaven, short-haired man in a sports coat, tie and sunglasses who always wields a gun. It all goes wrong after a visit to an oracle (I won't say why they visited, because it gives too much away - but she has to be the coolest oracle of all time), and Neo and Trinity set out to set what has gone wrong right.<br />I'm seriously having trouble seeing fault in this one - it more than justifies the two-hour plus length because the long dialouge scenes that normally bog such movies down are augmented by memorable, often dry-humored dialouge (my favorite part in that regard being the dinnertime scene aboard Morpheus' ship, the Nebuchadnezzar). And the fight scenes are awesome, too. Whoa... I think I'll take the red pill.they were going about their daily lives as usual. But this was just a computer program, called \\"The Matrix\\".

B000LP9RLC|5.0|Following on the heels of an album where he repudiated his past with his greatest backing band, Blood on the Tracks finds Bob Dylan, in a way, retreating to the past, recording a largely quiet, acoustic-based album. But this is hardly nostalgia -- this is the sound of an artist returning to his strengths, what feels most familiar, as he accepts a traumatic situation, namely the breakdown of his marriage. This is an album alternately bitter, sorrowful, regretful, and peaceful, easily the closest he ever came to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. That's not to say that it's an explicitly confessional record, since many songs are riddles or allegories, yet the warmth of the music makes it feel that way. The original version of the album was even quieter -- first takes of \\"Idiot Wind\\" and \\"Tangled Up in Blue,\\" available on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3, are hushed and quiet (excised verses are quoted in the liner notes, but not heard on the record) -- but Blood on the Tracks remains an intimate, revealing affair since these harsher takes let his anger surface the way his sadness does elsewhere. As such, it's an affecting, unbearably poignant record, not because it's a glimpse into his soul, but because the songs are remarkably clear-eyed and sentimental, lovely and melancholy at once. And, in a way, it's best that he was backed with studio musicians here, since the professional, understated backing lets the songs and emotion stand at the forefront. Dylan made albums more influential than this, but he never made one better.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|First, about the seller. Fast delivery, nicely packed. The DVD is placed inside a little book with pictures and lyrics, which allowed me to follow the French subtitles and sing it along ... in French. I like Garou as Quazimodo. And the Belle song is my favorite. Esmeralda - yes, I agree, too old and motionless. Well, no fix can be done with that one.   But if you like european style music and french language - the DVD is for you. I am now intended to re-read the Hugo's book.
1400063515|3.0|The author's first book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" was one of those rare, paradigm-changing books.  I expected \\"The Black Swan\\" to have a similiar impact by further developing and explaining the author's ideas.  I was disappointed.  The first half of the book seems to dither around without a clear focus.  It motivated the idea of \\"black swans\\"; however, it grows tiresome, and I was ready for the author to get-on with it.  The second half of the book contained the most important ideas.  The author spends a lot of time railing against use of the normal distribution, and an alternative modelling technique is presented.

0679882820|5.0|My kids love this book.  They will read it with us.  They make the sounds before the page.  They want us to read it over and over again. I know the book by heart with out looking.  That's how many time I have read it.  Great book.. We give it 5 stars!!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Every household in the WORLD should have this DVD set and every child should be forced to watch it once... every adult should be forced to watch it monthly.  We are a part of something larger than the human race and this video shows you that.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Outstanding! No outrageous special effects, no explosions. no blood and gore. Nothing but great acting. I was spellbound!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I dont understand the reveiws that say this is \\"hookless\\".  There are PLENTY of \\"hooks\\" on this album.  They may not jump out at you as easily as they did on Breakaway, but THEY ARE there.  They are all over this album.  Also, i think alot of songs on this album could have been on Breakaway easily.  My December is a pop album.  Its not hard rock and its not alternative.  Its a pop album with a rock edge to it.  Kelly has not totally and completely changed styles like alot of reviews says she has.  She has continued in the same vein as Breakaway except My December is more personal and more authentic as she had a hand in writing all the songs.  My December is the first Kelly Clarkson album i have and i am very glad its mine.  Kelly is a true artist so if you want a good pop/rock record get My December.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Undeniably classic Stevie Wonder. If you're a fan you have to have this one; if you're new to Stevie this is the place to start. Unlike some of his sugar sweet music from the 1980s, Songs In The Key Of Life has some melodies that can only be described as \\"haunting\\" -- they stay with you a lifetime. Some believe that a great meal should be paired with a great wine. Here, each melody is paired with the right lyrics. It's perfect and it's also the one album I would take if I could take only one to a desert island banishment.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|First off, I thought the unsteady camerawork was great. It perfectly matched the unbalanced state of Bourne's mind. The action was terrific and the plot was tight. I enjoyed Supremacy more than Identity, though the latter followed Ludlum's book more closely.    Must admit that one of the biggest pluses to me was killing off Marie at the very beginning. She was annoying in the extreme and nothing but an encumbrance because her character had nowhere to go.    On the bad side, I couldn't help but wonder why JB kept using his own passport. Since Identity established that he had lots of passports with different names on them, it was surprising that they weren't utilized. Secondly, I really felt that they could have played up the instability in Bourne's mind even more. Having him more unbalanced would have made a more sympathetic figure and made the viewer pull for him all the more.    I thought the ending was a bit hackish, but I guess the scene is being set for the final installment.
B000J103OI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The acting was great, and also enjoyed the scenery and clothes.  A very entertaining, fun movie.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar has created amazing movies, and this has to be their best. Stunning scenes, capturing the beauty of the world of coral reefs, along with the mystery of the oceans. Great story and humor.
B000001DYD|3.0|A strange recording that brings out the Punk in the Blues of P.J..It's been said she hates it.I think its guilty pleasure.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I thought this film was a total disaster.  It contains none of the features that made the old James Bond films fun to watch.  No humour, no memorable supporting characters, no witty repartee, no exciting, wacky chases,no innuendos, no fiendishly elaborate but ineffectual attempts to dispose of Bond, nothing to delight the viewer. A distinct shortage of beautiful women for my husband to ogle (he was very discontented). And as for Bond himself, this one is entirely lacking in charm, character, and charisma.  I will say nothing about the plot, as I found it completely incomprehensible from beginning to end.    I have always been a fan of the Roger Moore films myself, but this one made even Pierce Brosnan look good.
B00007FOMP|5.0|You must own this album.It changed music.It chronicles a era.It never sound old or dated .It was elegant,sexy ,topical & remains that way after all these years.<br /> Its one of the greatest albums ever made !
1844137872|5.0|This book is a must buy for anyone interested in modern day graffiti artists.  Banksy's politically charged and creatively poised art work is daring in the nature of its placement and the ways in which it conveys its message.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|...if it had all the songs! Title track \\"Era Vulgaris\\" for some reason was left off CD. Also the song \\"Running Joke\\". \\"Era Vulgaris\\" I downloaded using a peer-to-peer file sharing program (I think it was legally given away for free at some point, though I could not find it on the QOTSA website). \\"Running Joke\\" is included when you buy this from a certain online service.    It's a shame the CD doesn't have these two songs. Other than that, it's great.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows on TV today! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are very good actors, I would like to see the show run for 10 seasons!
B000OCXMAE|3.0|LP is one of my favorite bands and it still is. I appreciate the effort they put into stretching as a band and trying out new sounds. However, on many of the songs, I found myself wondering what happened to the unique LP sound I loved so much from Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and Meteora. The rap-metal sound is sadly almost nonexistent, and the album seems very \\"monster-ballad\\" heavy. If I heard some of these songs on the radio (like Shadow of a Day and In Between, that starts promising but never goes anywhere), I'm not sure I would even know it was Linkin Park. . .shocking considering how strongly the other albums are imprinted in my brain. Still worth a buy, but the hardcore fans hoping for sounds of albums past will most likely be disappointed. Listen to: Given Up (sounds more like classic LP), Leave Out All the Rest (an infectious ballad that is just cool like the Pushing Me Away Remix), What I've Done, and No More Sorrow (one of the few edgy songs).
B000OCXF0Q|3.0|This, Avril's third album, is a bit more upbeat and a bit less angsty than her last attempt. As with both her previous albums, The Best Damn Thing is an album that I find best to cherry pick for the songs I like. With my five favorites from this album, there is enough material over her three albums to put together a pretty decent showing. But there are still 2-3 songs on this album that I won't ever listen to again.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|The story starts out a little slow as the reflections of childhood are linked in to the reality of today.  The eventual beauty of the old house, the country air, the vineyard, and the local people create a wonderful setting for two people to fall in love.  The acting is excellent and the background music is very appealing.  In fact, the soundtrack is a wonderful piece of music for filling you with a positive sense of life.  The ending with it's creative twist is a message about what we all should strive for in life if we have the option of material things versus living to the fullest.
B00003CXA6|3.0|This film was Ted Turner's baby.  He wanted to produce a movie that re-enacted the bloddiest battle on American soil.  When it was completed, the film was over 4 hours long.  Much too long for theatrical release.  So he premiered it on his cable network, TNT in 1993.  The battle scenes itself are worth the long run time.  It's not too graphic and works as a historical referrence.  That may be it's downfall, as well.  Another is the long stretches of dialogue.  Though needed for continuity, after a while, the film started to suffer from overindulgence.  If you can endure it's length, you might find this film rather entertaining.  Give it a try!
B000P46QTA|4.0|Early in this film, set in the waning years of Communist power, a minister in the East German government remarks that one thing he has learned is that people never change. \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a testament to that fact that they do. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), an officer of the Stasi, the German secret police, has been assigned to establish a watch over Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a successful playwright who may have anti-regime tendencies, and his beautiful companion Crista-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a talented actress who has aroused the sexual interest of the aforementioned minister. Wiesler, a master of observation and, up to now, totally committed to the East German state, becomes involved in the lives of the two he watches in secret, and gradually a change comes over him. How matters subsequently develop gives us a window into the complications of human personality, and the many unexpected ways we cope with extraordinary pressure.<br /><br />A richly humane film, beautifully acted.
1563899426|4.0|I picked this first volume for a train ride home.  I had about six graphic novels to read and I bought this one because of its reputation and the decent price.    I was so impressed with the way the story flowed.  You can tell that this volume just sets up the characters for future storylines but the ending is still satisfying and leaves you wanting more.  This volume is easy to track down at any bookstore.  If you dont buy this right now, go out and read it.  You wont regret it.

B000MXPE7O|1.0|I bought this movie with the erroneous belief that I would be entertained.  Now all I can think about is I want Robert DeNiro to some how compensate me for the last two and a half unbearably boring hours of my life!  This movie is slow, boring, depressing, and doesn't even have a pay off at the end - which is a long time coming.  I love spy movies.  I love historical movies.  I don't think that telling an historically inaccurate movie about the beginning of the CIA, hello SPY CENTRAL, should be without some spy intrigue.  Oh, I am sorry; there was maybe 5 minutes of that type of scene.  I don't think it is enjoyable to watch a mass of shots showing how depressed a character is.   I got that his life was a big depressing abyss from the first hour.  Why belabor the point?  I was disappointed with this film from the beginning, but since I am such a fan of the whole cast and thought Robert DeNiro would be going somewhere with the story, I kept at it.  I have learned my lesson.    If you enjoy movies for enjoyment sake, don't watch this movie.  If, however, you are in an acting or film class, sure, watch it and learn how to be depressing.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The poster for \\"The Queen\\" - practically a study in Elizabeth's facial pores - led me to sense that the film would be a savage attack on the Queen and the monarchy. Instead, I found it to be an evenhanded and even sympathetic glance into the reaction of the Royal Family to British rage over their evident coolness to Princess Diana's death in 1997.<br /><br />The film portrays the events in question in a fairly straightforward manner. After Diana's final death ride, the Queen and her family are rousted from sleep and watch the unfolding story on television at Balmoral castle in Scotland, privately expressing heartfelt annoyance that Diana is again generating attention. Prince Philip (played admirably by American actor James Cromwell) is especially furious throughout the film, expressing the royals' contempt for Diana and what they felt was public mawkishness egged on by the British press. Their official reaction (except, curiously, for Prince Charles's) was unemotional and measured, driven by protocol (whether to raise the Royal standard to half staff or to make public statements) and a continuing desire to keep Diana in her place.<br /><br />Newly-elected PM Tony Blair (an incredible Michael Sheen) opposes the royals, but his close contact with them also lets him understand their point of view. Going against his young staff, whose anti-royal stance has them enjoying the Royal discomfort, Blair shows himself perhaps a bit too sympathetic to the Queen's plight, a tendency that might explain his recent woes.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is a study in contrasts -- between the royal world of starchy reserve that no longer inspires, and the messiness of Tony Blair's TV-watching and cereal-chomping young family; between a confessional media culture (that Diana played to the hilt) and an older culture that prized privacy and decorum above all. The fun of the film is watching the Royals becoming aware of the need to embrace this new culture and by so doing remain at least minimally relevant to their people.<br /><br />Helen Mirren both impersonates her subject (!) and interprets her. Mirren's performance helps the audience make sense of the Queen's inner struggle as well as of her professional carapace of detachment. A scene where she throw her pack of dogs of morsel of meat, and then with a hand gesture commands them to wait (they do!) before eating it, exemplifies the self-control that Elizabeth demands of herself and expects of those around her. Only once did the movie leap the bounds of plausibility, as the Queen, driving her own truck around Balmoral at the height of the crisis, gets stuck in the middle of a river. Her sighting of a beautiful, hunted animal begins to open her eyes to her people's grief over Diana, another beautiful \\"animal\\" hunted to death. Though the scene screams \\"metaphor!,\\" the script is silent, allowing the viewer to make the connection.<br /><br />The DVD extras are spare, consisting of a not-too-revelatory \\"making of\\" mini-flick.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is a standout movie, very solidly cast, very well-written, daring and successful in tackling recent events, believable and illustrative of the time period. That it does not hit one over the head with facile conclusions -- and that it allows a variety of points of view to co-exist unresolved -- demonstates its confidence and is very attractive.

1591841666|4.0|If there was ever a book that made me stop and reflect - on my past my present and my directions!  This is it and it is immensely valuable to me and my business.<br /><br />I am currently leaning my way out of the dip and in the past I have been in dips and cul-de-sacs as well as on hilltops.  The trick is to know the difference.  The trick also, as I see it, is to recognise when the dip has potholes that make you stumble and look longingly at some side alleys which look smoother but lead you off that steep hill and into another cul-de-sac.<br /><br />For me the book is a clear guide to my daily reflections on potholes,  attractive cul-de-sacs and business success in my work.<br /><br />Very valuable Thank you Seth!
B000O178BY|1.0|Trent's glory days ended with the past millennium. While WITH TEETH was already showing signs of weariness it still featured a few catchy tunes. But YEAR ZERO is Trent's nadir and Waterloo at once. I couldn't care less about his political rants because they are obviously catering to the current trend. They are so embarrassingly hackneyed and dumb that I just cannot take them seriously. Maybe If I were an angry, disaffected, 18-year-old teenager, I'd gobble down each and every word of it. But I've matured since then and can see right through his threadbare, political agenda.  To make matters worse, there isn't a single memorable hook line or melody.   It sounds improvised and random with nothing to perk you up. Where are the glorious soundscapes from THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL?  Apaprently, Trent was having a laugh in the studio with YZ. He was testing how far he can go with nonexistent music before people quit buying his product. I believe some people would even be praising his output if it consisted of nothing but him reading the phone book. There is no way I'm ever gonna listen to this cd which makes a greater frisbee than cd. I didn't feel a single song. And the lyrics put me off it straight away.  Maybe Trent should realise that he's past his sell-by-date and he should just go back to lifting weights and join some political party instead. It would be more genuine and dignified than this outrageous excuse for a cd.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|A great soundtrack from a wonderful movie.  Too bad the second and third pirates movies weren't as good as the first.  Regardless, great soundtrack.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I can't wait to get the DVD.  I loved the art direction and style of Sin City so this was a no brainer.  Even after watching the latest summer blockbusters of 2007 (ie. Transformers, Spiderman 3, Die Hard), I consider 300 to be the #1 action movie in the past year.  I see many negative reviews from customers here but the general consensus seems to agree with my opinion.  Most people enjoyed this movie and recommend it.  If you're not sure whether to pay ~$20, rent it.  Simple as that.

B00008PW3Q|1.0|Lindsey really put the nail in the coffin of Fleetwwod Mac with this one.  I've been listening to FM since 1970, and I can take their ups and downs.  Lindsey first tried to destroy them with Tusk.  They actually synthesized Stevie's voice on this junk!  Screaming guitars, poor playing, and poor recording make this a gigantic dissappointment.    I love Stevies music and even she sounds terrible on this.  But I recently saw her in concert and she still sounds great!  So the recording, synthesizing and overdubbing (or whatever) ruined even her on this abomination.  I have to think LB did this on purpose (he produced the album, right?) in attenmpt to put the Mac (and Stevie) out of business to make more room for his mediocre solo efforts.  Unfortunately, he may just have finally succeeded.      Rubbish.
B000K7VHJQ|1.0|I saw this film, and I thought it was an entertaining dramatization of the catholic/christian legend, I will leave all the historical errors everyone points on this film, focusing on the little details is not how to write a review.     I think the movie itself, as a movie, does not offer anything new (as a cinematographic work) the foreign language was interesting, but I find a bit... sadistic the way they exagerated the torture of the main character, honestly, I find disgusting how the conservative guys didn't complain about that, well.. how could they? it was in their interest.     The performance is not great, it is fairly good, but there are no outstanding actors/actresses in this film.     I'd recommend this film only to catholic or christian people, only with the warning that even when prominent people said it was a \\"realistic\\" dramatization of what really happened, I'd say that you shouldn't stay with the movie, in this case, I think that the book is more acurate.     (by the way, yes, english is not my native language, and I trully like feedback, but be a bit smart and go beyond gramatical errors complaints please)
B000PY52EU|5.0|If you want to watch this movie simply becuase J.T. is in it, you're making a big mistake.  He has a maybe 20 minutes of screen time 15 of which he is crying.  he is simply a pretty boy in a tough guy role and I didnt believe his performance for one minuete.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I just bought this cd and I cannot stop listening to it. I have to admit that the 1st time i put it on it took me like 3 listens to get it, and when you get it, it's the most awesome cd i have heard in a while.    My favorite tracks are  1. Maybe, the lyrics are so relate-able  2. Never Again, really liked this on the 1st listen  3. Yeah, this is my ultimate favorite track on the whole cd, it's upbeat and i like the lyrics  4. How i feel & Dont waste your time  so 80's, love it    And last but not least my favorite song is the bonus track, im not sure what its called, i think Chivas, but not sure, i love that song, it sounds like a different Kelly, its a beautiful song and i like the message.    Actually i like the whole cd. This is my 1st Kelly cd i have purchased, im not a big American Idol person, but she blew me away with this one.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|This Time around Kelly is Rock N\\"Roll and the CD is little Hard to Use to.    I admit the first time that I played this CD. I thought it was white trash and she Should have had Clive Davis behind it. But now it is starting to grow on him more each time I play it.    Play it a couple of times before making judgment on it and you will find it enjoyable like the first two CD
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is probably one of those movies that will stand the test of time. It's great, suspensful, and extremely gripping. If you don't cry at the end of this movie, something is terribly wrong with you! Loved every minute of it, even the subtitles, which usually annoy me.

0345337581|5.0|The memory techniques taught in this book are tantamount to taking crib notes into an exam. They are, in fact, easier than writing things down. That goes for numbers, dates, events, lists and on and on.    You WILL amaze yourself. You WILL be able to quickly look through a deck of playing cards and immediately name the missing cards, you WILL be able to remember large numbers after hearing or reading them once, you WILL be able to remember lists of large numbers. You WILL be able to recall every scene in a movie or series of events in real life in precise chronological order.    The great thing about this book is that it blows you away with your own abilities. It's a 'self-help' book in the truest sense. You WILL feel better about yourself.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This DVD does a great job of summarizing the climate change issues, what the problems are, what can be done and why the current administration has not addressed it and in fact has ignored, blocked honest information and lied about climate issues as a problem. It also addresses why the press has not kept the faith and reported this in a forth right manner.     It amazes me how clear and obvious it is when you are presented the facts. Its also amazing how so many respected scientist and experts were ignored adn punished because the facts they were presenting were inconvenient to the oil companies and politicians. If acknowledged those facts would force politicians to take this seriously and DO something.    Its rather embarrassing to the United States (and should be to us as voters)that we are politically ignoring this while much of the rest of the worlds governments have been doing something about pollution and climate change for years.     For example, did you know that one of the most signficant reasons US made cars have trouble selling in the rest of the world is not because of competitiveness or pricing? Its because the US emission standards for US made cars are below the rest of the world, and therefore US cars do not meet those standards and cannot be sold in those countries.     There would be many more jobs in the US, an auto industry that was doing well and the auto unions would have more of what they want if we could sell more cars overseas. But the current administration does not want the emission standards to rise because this would result in better fuel economy and less gas sales, hurting the administrations friends in the oil industry. What ever happened to politicians doing what is best for the electorate and all of the US? Best for the world and future children? Embarrassing.    Mr Gore does a great job of making this easy to follow and its very understandable. He backs up his observations, insights and comments with facts.    Read the book as well. Its fills in a lot more detail that is not possible to do in a DVD version.    Thank you Mr Gore for taking the risk of this unpolpular issue and making this your cause for over 20 years.

Marcus made him and he's giving all these orders in the beginning. I love Beckinsale in these movies, but come on! She's like a wonder woman in all these fight scenes.<br /><br />I disagree with the one and two star reviews. I think it's a movie worth watching just for the entertainment value.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Fab Four were at the top of their form and their work was varied and adventurous on  \\"Abbey Road\\".  While murder wasn't a totally unknown topic in rock, \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" with its bright instrumentation blew our minds back in the day.     Odd and sad that \\"Come Together\\" opens this CD and it was the last of their big hits together.  I've rearranged this one on my iPod so that \\"Golden Slumbers\\" and is the last of this offering.  Just seemed fitting to me.
B000QFCD2W|4.0|King Diamond has really created his own distinct style and genre, and in a playing field with no other contenders, he reamains the King indeed. King Diamond albums have been something I look forward to since I was 13 or so, when I first heard \\"Them\\". Bizarre, gothic and dark concept albums featuring the phenomenal classic metal guitar work of Andy LaRocque and others and, of course, King Diamond's incomparable caterwauling vocals and sinister storytelling, there is nothing else quite like it.<br /><br />\\"Give Me Your Soul Please\\" is no exception, and an excellent addition to King's canon, his latest tale of the supernatural involves murder, suicide, a ghostly apparition of a little girl in a bloody dress, a black cat, and a floating severed head. So, business as usual. (laughs) I always love the way King assumes the voices of different characters in his stories in an almost theatrical manner, and the eerie music and amazing, intese riffs and solos laid out on this release by Mike Wead and Andy LaRocque are just sick....I had a blast with this disc, but for other King fans it is perhaps a bit weaker than some of his other releases (although it is hard to top the trifecta of \\"Them\\", \\"Conspiracy\\" and \\"The Eye\\", which remain my favorite). For folks who are new to the King, this really isn't a bad place at all to start. Be sure to listen all the way through, preferably in one sitting (the only proper way to listen to a King Diamond album). In a crowded metal scene, this stuff really comes off as being quite original....recommended!
0316518565|3.0|Nick Leeson was a sort of one-man Enron. He apparently was making unbelievable profits, but it was all fake.    The theme of his confessional book is that he should not have been able to get away with it as long as he did. That's true.     But there is another theme, which he does not quite seem to get. His bosses were rotten managers, willing to overlook his absurd coverup as long as he seemed to be generating huge profits for Barings Bank. But Leeson himself was a rotten manager.    He may have been a good arbitrageur trader. It is difficult to know how accurate his account is. But he continually managed himself into jams.    The first was, comparatively, trivial. A 20,000 pound trading error. It might have cost him and perhaps his staff their jobs -- although that would not necessarily have been a wise management decision by Barings -- so he covered it up. By exceeding his remit, he \\"traded out\\" of that error. Later, according to him, he repeated the trick on a much bigger scale -- 6 million pounds.    At that point, he should have asked himself: Am I really able to do this job? But that is not the sort of question gamblers ask of themselves.    And make no mistake. This is not about business. Leeson, based in Singapore, traded the difference between the prices in Singapore and Osaka of Japanese government bonds and the Nikkei stock index futures.     The futures trading was pure gambling, even if done by the rules. There is no business need for a stock index futures board. It is exactly like fan-tan -- except that nowhere could you put down a  $50 million bet in fan-tan.    Leeson tells his story beautifully (helped by co-author Edward Whitley), and he attempts to make it beautiful by repeatedly asserting his love for his wife. She, however, comes across as a cipher.     Leeson would also like us to think that he has gained insight into his criminality. This seems doubtful.   When he was very far into his finagling, he writes, \\"I wasn't sure whether I'd committed an actual crime.\\"    Much later, after he was trying to get himself into an English prison (the only really amusing section of the book), his lawyer comments that the only people who lost money were some bondholders. This is simply bizarre. And if Leeson feels any regret for having cost the jobs of many hundreds or thousands of honest, low level workers, he shows no sign. He is, rather, gleeful at having brought shame and ruin to his superiors.    They may have deserved a lot of that -- although being foolish is not a crime, and taking someone else's money is. That's a distinction Leeson seems not to get.    So, you are now asking yourself, what does this mean to me? Leeson has served his time and is out of prison.    Well, if George Bush has his way, your retirement nest egg is going to be tied to a stock index fund. You might want to think about that in the context of  \\"Rogue Trader.\\"
B0007TKNL0|1.0|Where to begin...I've seen the play 5 times in London and was left wanting seeing it once more on stage, i must have burned a hole in the CD of the original London cast (Where I came to know about Sarah Brightman).     When I heard they made a movie out of it I was thrilled and expected something good, I missed it in theatre, and somehow resisted the temptation to buy the DVD, and I'm glad I did for I got to see the thing on TV.  And it's an utter disaster, Emmy Rossum would do well to take acting classes pronto as I've never seen such a pathetic act : no emotions, stupid open mouth all the time. Gerard Butler could do better in acting but was by far not the worse...too bad he skipped singing classes because you just can't play the Phantom when you can't sing. Some of his songs are just plain painful to hear. The two directors show no passions or emotions in their roles. The role of \\"Raoul\\" is soapy, marshmallowy and badly played. I think the only one I truely enjoyed in this movie is Minnie Driver in her role as \\"Carlotta\\" as not only she can sing, but she can act.   Why they didn't cast some of those who played it on stage in the movie is simply beyhond me.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Don't take this review too seriously. . . I had to go to several web sites to   figure out what the movie was about. . . but I was greatly entertained by all of the things that I didn't understand.  Closure isn't necessarily a property of enjoyable art. The movie is fascinating at the very least.  It seems like film noir to me.
1400063515|5.0|Another thought provoking read by Nassim Taleb; some of the arguments are reminiscent of his earlier book ('Fooled by Randomness'), but the asymmetries of our daily life are explored in much more detail. 'The Black Swan' alludes to the 'fractal', or highly variable, non-Gaussian flow of history and events - as Nassim states, our history is a series of jumps, not sigma-based variations. This same concept applies to the markets, social sciences, and many other 'assumed to be Gaussian' processes in our daily life.<br /><br />Tirades against narrative fallacy, or our tendency to fit patterns and do 'dimensionality reduction', and retrospective distortion, our illusion of posterior predictability due to selective recall and fact-fitting are sprinkled throughout the text. The arguments are interesting, but need be taken with a grain of salt - I think that's the way the author would want them to stand. In the end, you won't be able to predict the future, but perhaps you'll become a fool that is aware of some of his own follies - the information about the possibility of a Black Swan is valuable by itself.
0312330537|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Took it on vacation in the CA Sierras, but spent about half of time mentally in Bombay/India while reading it.  Began to recommend it to other people with me after about 10 pages and continued to do so for the rest of my vacation.    So many people have written their reviews praising the book - don't want to repeat all of their praises here.  But, do want to point out that this book is simply hilarious in parts.  All the way from touchingly loving funny descriptions of his friends to slapstick descriptions of his attempts at riding horses that had me laughting out loud many, many times.  On the other side, it contains one of the best descriptions of the devestating physical and emotional difficulties of going cold turkey off of heroin that I have ever read.  And, on  yet another side, I really liked some of the philosophical discussions.  Not many times do I pick up a novel and read *interesting* discussions about suffering and the nature of good and evil.    I can't wait to find a friend it the real world who has read this book, too, so we can talk about it.      Can't see how a movie can possibly convey the richness of this book.  They'll probably just use the plot.  But the incredible beauty of the book is far, far beyond the basic plot....JONNY DEPP - please do this book justice and find a way to convey the emotional depth it contains, too!
0792162803|4.0|The real Superstar is Molly Shannon, who never gets enough credit for her comedic and bona fide acting skills.  It's great to have the always-funny Will Ferrell (as well as Harland Williams, one of my favorite comics) alongside her for the ride, but her portrayal of Mary Katherine Gallagher is all you really need to laugh it up for the 80 or so minutes of this SNL skit - turned full-fledged movie.  I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be one of the lucky people who were always cool and made great sport of putting the Mary Katherine Gallaghers of the world down.  I'll never know because Mary Katherine is definitely \\"my people,\\" a unique character who suffers the insults and humiliations of life among her cooler, prettier peers even as she dreams of having just a taste of the kind of life they take for granted.  In the context of this movie, what Mary Katherine yearns for is a real slobber-knocker of a kiss - and, like all of us losers, she falls for the most popular guy/girl in school.  In other words, she does not have an easy row to hoe.<br /><br />She is realistic enough to realize that the likes of Sky Corrigan (Ferrell) isn't going to drop the head cheerleader and come smooching her way any time soon (even after he tells her she has some nice moves).  No, she thinks the only way she can get the hunky guy is to emulate her Hollywood heroines and become a - wait for it - Superstar!  And just when she thinks she's exhausted all of her options, along comes a school talent show (with the winner getting the part of an extra in a morally positive film in Hollywood) that just might be the answer to her prayers.  Winning the talent show would definitely impress Sky, she tells herself.<br /><br />To make her dreams come true, she's going to have to talk her grandmother into letting her audition, scratch and claw her way through a catfight or two with the head cheerleader (who also happens to be Sky's girlfriend), and overcome several other less than surprising obstacles in her way.  She does have some help, though - from her fellow Special Education students, her new best friend, and even her own personal image of Jesus (also played by Will Ferrell).<br /><br />Yes, it's oftentimes low-brow humor, especially in terms of the whole armpit thing, but somehow Mary Katherine's story always manages to remain above the fray of tastelessness and vapidity.  There's a little (or maybe even a lot) of Mary Katherine Gallagher in many of us, and there is actually a good story in here beyond all of the jokes.  The filmmakers even manage to pull off a really good ending without insulting our intelligence.  This is just a fine, really funny movie.ay.

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Back in the day, when I was in high school, I absolutely could not stand Pink Floyd with the exception of one song (Wish You Were Here).  When tracks came across the radio I just tried not to listen and couldn't understand the hype.<br />Then for reasons I can't recall, my girlfriend (later my wife) and I went to see The Wall when it released at the theater.  I sat, mesmerized and staring at the screen.  To see the movie is to hear the entire album set from start to finish and the movie put it all in context.  The thing I was missing before, I understood now.  The music of Pink Floyd is put together in albums and if you don't listen to them that way they are disconnected and just don't make sense.<br />Now I was hooked and started to listen to PF albums instead of individual cuts.  I bought the cassette tape (hi-tech back then), wore it out, wore out a backup copy, wore out another tape and years later bought the CD set.  Today I'm buying the DVD and can't wait to experience it all again.<br />Bottom line, the movie is dark, it is disturbing, and it is terribly awesome.  Pink Floyd played the music of the insane.  Maybe it is the insane who still play the music of Pink Floyd.  In any case, I can't wait to introduce my 15 year-old son to it.  Wonder if his jaw will drop like mine did?
078322737X|5.0|Into my heart on air that kills  From you far country blows:  What are those blue remembered hills,  What spires, what farms are those?    That is the land of lost content,  I see it shining plain,  The happy highways where I went  And cannot come again.    This verse, from A.E. Housman's \\"A Shropshire Lad\\", summarizes everything that I feel for American Graffiti. The movie opened when I was 13 years old. It was my first \\"R\\" rated movie and the sold out theater erupted with laughter over and over. Now I'm 47 and I find it almost too sad to watch. Where did my childhood friends go? What lives have they led? The sweet promise of youth: a happy highway where I went and cannot come again.
B00082IJ08|4.0|This is easily one of the most complex, intelligent, and layered albums of the decade. A addictive mix of Rock, hip hop, and brains, everysong on this album is brilliant, the only low being the far to long \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\".  I've seen some people complain about it being depressing. SO WHAT? It's not emo, just honest, and truthful.  For me the album is about the wrongs of modern society, But interpratation seem to vary, with the Iraq war in the lead. Far from the \\"collection of random sounds\\" some would have you think. Yes, they are heavy on the synths, but the songs are brilliant on musical level as well, as the lyrical.  I think this album is supposed to take place in some kind of apocalyptic/and or totalitarian future, by the way.    Just so you know, lyrically this is a VERY bleak album, barely letting up in DARE    Last Living Souls 4/5- Simple opener, asking if they are the last good people left on this Earth, finally deciding that they must be with the line \\"Yeah, we're the last livin' souls\\"    Kids With Guns 5/5-My favorite track, Killer bass line, either about how we let society turn ourselves to monsters(So they're turning yourselfs to monster's/Setting yourself on fire/Turning you all to monsters/ Its all desire), or the Iraq War depending on your interpretation of the album as a whole    O' Green World 4/5-A song about either mans destruction of our only planet through polution, or mans destruction of its only planet through nuclear war. I said the album was bleak    Dirty Harry 5/5- A initially light and jumpy song, until you realize that the lightness is supposed to symbolize how those of us who have not been in war are innoncent and iggnorant of the horror AND the Iraq war(I need a gun/To keep myself from harm/ those poor people/ are burning in the sun/...I need a gun/'cus all I do is dance) The act of dancing in the song represent innocence, and about half way through, one of the best rap's i've ever heard comes out, this time from the point of view of a soldier ending in a few lines aimed directly at bush, and a couple of line of him remembering when he could dance,or be innocent(The war is over/So said the speaker/with the flight suit on/Maybe to him I'm just a pawn /So he can advance /Remember when I used to dance /Man, all I want to do is dance)    Feel Good inc. 5/5- You all know how it sounds. Its about how we surround ourselves with stuff that we think makes us feel good, because the corporations(symbolized by the De La Soul, the rapper) tell us so. But in the end all we need to be happy is purity and love(I.e. the windmill)    El Manana 5/5-Slow, and mournful. About a lost love, or maybe a soldier who commited atrocities so bad he's god has forsaken him    Every Planet We Reach is Dead 3/5- I like this song, but its drags on, and I don't mind a long song, but this DRAAAGGGGSSSS. So I have no clue what its about, because i skip it :P    And I'm stopping there, you can figure the rest out yourself. My fingers are hurt and I'm tired.    Oh, and it passes generational barriers as well, my 50 year old grandma loves this album to! Then again, she's not into what you would think of as \\"Old person music\\"(Frank Sinatra FTW!) so don't go buying it as a gift for you grammy.
B000068TPN|5.0|While many of the reviews will focus on the story, all I would add is that this starts to put in place a very important turning point in the second Vietnam War..(This movie pays attention to the previous French attempt to fight on this ground). For me one of the most notable and telling scenes from this movie was in the deleted section when Hal Moore met with McNamara and informed him that this was not going to be an easy fight and that it was the wrong fight. This movie and the book stand as a shining example of the courage of the American soldier and the stupidity of their political leaders.
B000007T1M|5.0|This album is freaking amazing, full of songs that are both Socially and Politacaly concious(Sugar, CUBErt, P.L.U.C.K) To just all around goofiness(Suite-Pee, ddevil). My only complaint is the over use of the f-word. I love this band, and I don't mind swearing, but they relied way to much on swearing to display anger in this album.
B000OONTFU|4.0|Buyers beware... issues playing this HDVD boxset on the XBOX360 HDVD player. Matrix Revolutions won't play at all! (third disk)... all other disks are fine and after a bit of research on the internet I found many have had issues with Matrix boxset on the 360 ... Hopefully a 360 update will be provided soon till then don't expect it to play flawlessly if your luck is anything like mine. With the exception of the disk that won't play the other movie recordings are superb.
0743496728|3.0|This is the first Jodi Picoult book I have read and went into it with very high hopes.  Parts of the book were excellent, particularly dealing with the boy who did the shooting and his parents.  However, being a lawyer, and one who went to law school in New Hampshire where the story takes place, I could not suspend my disbelieve enough to buy the legal side of this story, which was a major chunk of it.  The stereotypical overachiever who gets a judicial appointment because during the interview she says \\"I'm a Mom.\\" The defense attorney who brings his infant with him everywhere, including court.  The tough prosecutor who is one dimensional.  Didn't work for me at all, as this would never happen in the real legal world.      I also saw the twist coming a mile away and finished reading the book to see if I was right.  I haven't given up all together on Picoult, but the next book I read will be taken out of the library.
0066620996|5.0|Most management books could be much shorter than they actually are.  This is no different.  I was very pleased, however, with Collins' interesting observations regarding the role of IT in becoming great.  It makes perfect sense.  Why didn't I think of that?
B000O75F7C|5.0|Steve Wilson did a good job on this one.  It is very good. I have enjoyed everything that Porcupine Tree has done, except Stupid Dream. It sucked.  Blank Planet is WAY better than Stupid Dream but not quite as good as Up the Downstair, The Sunday of Life, Deadwing, or In Absentia.  BUT I still give it 5 stars!
0679720200|5.0|\\"The Stranger\\" is  (and I know that some of you out there will inadvertently feel this is presumptuous)One of if not the greatest work of short fiction in the history of the twentieth century. Let us forget the legacy of the author.(being a key contributor to philosophy,literature, and essays among other subjects too numerous to debate) Let us even forget that this was his first truly finished piece of fiction. The story of Mearsult stands to this day (and most certainly beyond) as the finest exploration of man and his struggle with the absurdity of modern life. Existential thought could never have been realized without our hero. Mearsult was the protagonist by the way. Not the judge, nor the Arab, nor the sun.        Mearsult is a completely identifiable personality in all of modern man. He is no stranger to any of us , infact I believe that if we really scrutinize the character of Mearsult then we can find a relationship with him that isn't buried or hidden. There is no deep pursuit of darkness in the soul here. He is and will remain the exact copy of our selves for decades to come.       To get on with it then, I should say that this examination of the world , religion, consequence, etc stands as one of the finest pieces of work from Camus. No great grandstanding against facism , no explorations of how sinister the self is when confronted by the reality of the self. This work is a true masterpiece and monument to Camus ideals and philosophies on the absurd.        I would further recomend that if the topic interested you that you should read his collected esseys entitled\\" The Rebel\\".
1594489505|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Such an insight into the personal reactions of those living in constant fear of being bombed and the experience of seeing dead bodies in their streets.  As usual, Hosseini is able to create a living history for his readers and makes us aware of the plight this horrific turmoil causes the people living there.  I did not want this story to end.
B000RW3YYA|3.0|Warning!  There are multiple spoilers in the following review!<br /><br />I've watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I'm convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.<br /><br />First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I'm not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they've been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.<br /><br />Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett's leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.<br /><br />The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I'm anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series' run.  If you don't have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC theyhave killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.<br /><br />I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.<br /><br />While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in \\"Common Ground,\\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal'c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.<br /><br />So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.  But until we see how the new city in the air Atlantis works in terms of story and how the new cast changes affect the chemistry we won't know for sure.  One thing is for certain.

B000FA57N0|5.0|My friend told me to get this movie. I was hesitant at first because it just did not look like something I would like. I was completely wrong! This is a great movie with fantastic special effects and a pretty entertaining story. The quality of the HD transfer is excellent and it plays perfectly right out of the box on the XBOX 360 HD-DVD player.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Ok , the title says it all , nuff said. This is one the greatest albums i've ever heard in my life , it flows perfectly from start to end and the musicianship is outstanding. Why is it still only 4 stars , why????!!

B000002H2H|5.0|For sheer metal mayhem, there are fewer CDs available that are better than this one.  Ride the Lightning features some of the finest Metallica material they produced.  From Creeping Death to For Whom the Bell Tolls, this is a CD not to be missed.  A five star metal masterpiece.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|The narration on Planet Earth is awful done by David Attenborough.  I was hoping that I could buy the Planet Earth series as narrated by the American actress that narrates it on Animal Planet.  This was a gift but as soon as the other is out, I will get it!!!
B000002H97|5.0|There is certainly much debate amongst Metallica fans, especially the original fans, as to the greatness of this CD.  Though it may not be as raw as the earlier CDs, it is one heck of a great rock and roll album.  The CD is full of one great song after another.  My personal favorite is Wherever I may Roam.  Had this been Metallica's only CD/Album, they would have been considered a success.  One of the greatest live bands of all time show there skills on this excellent 5 star CD.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Every night I watch re-runs of \\"Sex and The City.\\" I love this show it's so unique and original. Sarah Jessica Parker is ah-mazing!

B000002U82|5.0|Incredibly, Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd, was released almost 35 years ago.  The amazing thing is that this excellent CD is still important and relevant today.  I can listen to Us and Them over and over again.  The hypnotic perfection of this CD is amazing.  Most bands would love to have a collection of greatest hits that would rival this one album by this incredible band.  If you have not heard this, you are in for a treat.  A Five star masterpiece.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this for my father in the US as he had seen one of the episodes while visiting me in the UK.  It is an absolutely wonderful series, for children and adults.  This edition is even better because it is narrated by Attenborough, not by Signourney Weaver as the US airing had inserted.  The production and direction of the series is one of the best I have ever seen for a documentary and would recommend it with all my heart.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is a great listening experience.  Many of the songs on this classic two CD set are amongst the best Pink Floyd has released.  Some of them are just okay; however, the majority make for a five star experience.  I suggest making yourself comfortably numb and enjoying one of the more popular rock experiences of all time.

0316067598|1.0|The United States is blessed to have sons of republic that value our country as much as Marcus Luttrell does.  The warriors that defend democracy are needed, revered and are true heros.  This book howedver does not honor any of those values and is poorly written.  Mr. Luttrell sprinkles his tough guy image and over the top machismo throughout the book I was wonder just who the hell he was trying to convince how tough he is/was.  Mr. Luttrell isn't too up on the Constitution and just how the government of his country is structured and the references to the liberal media, liberal politicians made me wonder is some fourth level hack from Karl Rove's office wrote the drivel.  The men and women that serve in our Armed Forces are to be celebrated.  They go on looking for WMD's even though there were never any and many of the people of the United States were aware of the lies years ago.  This book is poorly written, heavily slanted and full of uninteresting drivel.  Save you money and go buy Richard Marchinko's books about the SEAL Teams.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|After reading several others reviews it is painfully obvious that nobody read the books. The Ludlum books are fantastic. Bourne Identity while having many inconsitencies with the book was still somewhat close. Supremacy jumps onto another track altogether and is a completely different story than Ludlums Supremacy, I dread the release of Ultimatum as there is no possible way for this series to get back on track. Do yourself a favor and jump to the books section of Amazon and pick up all three and read them instead of allowing Hollywood to destroy literature. The books are so much better.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was a favorite when it was on television and I was really happy to see it available on DVD.  My only regret is that there weren't more episodes.  I love the film version Serenity, too.  The show is exciting and funny and totally catches your attention.  The cast is awesome as well.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Love every song. I want to not like the newer JON Bon Jovi, the guy with his pricey Kenneth Cole clothes, sycophant worship of Al Gore, a fancy Vipor and his new 26 million dollar penthouse in NYC, but, I put on my big girl panties and dealth with it....It's BON JOVI, the band, that I still love!  With age comes growth. I think as Bon Jovi ages, they are showing what true musicians and writers they are. They are not just rockers.  Bon Jovi's direction may have been very calculated, however, it proved to be a great decision. The evolution of Bon Jovi proves that the band can progress and still be great. The musical training and background of each member proves that when their differences are combined, they are great musicians...no label needed.   Although the duet with Rimes has Jon \\"contorting\\" his lyrics a bit too much, as if to prove he can do country twang, overall, I love this cd. Like other Bon Jovi CD's, it's a great \\"sing along\\" in the car!
B000PTYP5C|5.0|DT fan since their early beginnings as Majesty. Have all the albums, seen most of the tours, have all the live DVD's. Learned most of the Petrucci licks, at least the ones acessible to mere mortals. This album crushes, lots of technical stuff, and heavy at the same time. My jury is still out on Prophets of War, I'm hoping it's more of an issue awareness kind of song like the stem cell research song on Six Degrees, and not just some moveon.org type Dixie Chix baloney. Otherwise great over all, especially the two part intro/outro track, and the \\"monster\\" themed songs, Forsaken and Dark Eternal Night. aka NADS.    Anyway, there's usually two kinds of people, DT fans and non-DT fans, and if you're a fan you'll like it, if you're not, you won't. But if you're not into DT yet, my best analogy would be that if you liked Rust in Peace by Megadeth, this is where to try to get into the Dream Theater.
630463949X|5.0|I am a fan of Fleetwood Mac,but never went to see them live. I would have liked to see the band at the top of their game,but this DVD gives you a very good idea of what that must of been like. The band is in top form playing a wide range of their material. The only time I was disappointed is when Stevie Nicks didn't reach for the high notes like on the studio recordings. This may be due to her not being able to do it any more or just wanting to change it up a bit. Either way when you know songs as well as these you want to hear them done the way you remember them. Aside from that one small complaint,the sound is rich and clear and the transfer is very good. The band really conects with each other and you feel like you are part of something special when your watching this. If you like concert DVD's,you should have this in your collection.
B00005JPQT|4.0|Bruce Willis is back as John McClane and ready to battle it out with more terrorists. Hackers plan to shut off the country's power supply so they can get into everyones bank accounts. Timothy Olyphant is good as the main villain, but by the end I was a little tired of him. He is sort of weak, but luckily his henchwoman played by Maggie Q isn't. She is not a martial arts actress whatsoever, but still looks great throwing Bruce Willis around. Cyril Raffaelli is Olyphant's other main henchman, and he gets to show off his amazing athletic skills in a good short fight with Willis. Willis does fine in the fight scenes. Not pretty, but he gets the job done.<br /><br />The comedy is good for the most part, and the whole movie is enjoyable. Halfway through I started wondering if the action was gonna pick up a little bit, and I ended up getting more than I asked for. The action gets so crazy that I had to sneak back in and watch it all again.<br /><br />4/5
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I am a fan of the Eagles and never saw them live. This DVD looks and sounds great and the band plays and sings like the polished pros that they are. If I have one complaint it is the song selection. These guys have a lot of classic songs and they could have added a few more of the early classics for my taste. Other than that one complaint,this is a great music DVD to have in your collection.
B000002UB3|5.0|I was a college freshman in 1963 when the Beatles burst upon the scene in the United States.  For the next 7 years, my friends and I waited with baited breath for each new album release.  By 1970, the party was over for the Beatles, but their music lives on and has been embraced by each succeeding generation.  What has always amazed me is how their music could be so diverse, innovative and flat-out wonderful and at the same time be so  commercially successful.  One does not usually associate high artistic quality with mass popularity.      I will avoid the unproveable assertion that \\"Abbey Road\\" is the group's best album but will state unequivocably that it is my all-time favorite.  The music is truly inspired, particularly the medley on the second side.  I am truly grateful that the Beatles stayed together long enough to record this masterpiece.
B000S6LT42|5.0|This box set boast two concerts and lots of bonus footage from concerts in Japan,China,Argentina etc. There are some good documentaries,cool bonus duets and a whole lot for under $30.00 on four DVDs. One of the best things about this set is that they perform Sway live. I will say that the Austin show is the best and the transfer looks fantastic! The sound is very good dispite what I have read from some other reviewers. I can hear Keith just fine.....when he's playing.Look,I love these guys,but lets face it...they are geting old. Keith plays he signature licks and rest his mummified fingers every chance he gets. It is still a pretty good set and I'm glad I own it. If your a fan your gonna buy it and if your not......what are you reading this for?
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Enjoy this title on HD-DVD, 300 is a great movie i would recommend to anyone.  HD-DVD will support this film at the highest level possible.  (and yes blu-ray fanboys i own both format so nothing to do with that)    Enjoy!
0060594896|5.0|I have to recommend both the book and the audio CD. This book literally helped me take control of my out of control life. Taking 100% responcibility for my actions is a HUGE concept. Have I heard some of it before? Yes, but for the first time all these theories melded together in a way to make the path crystal clear.<br /><br />It is a long read but a really enjoyable journey and I am truly thankful to have taken it with Jack Canfield. If you or anyone you know is not happy about where their lives are or seem to be going give them this book. I have given it to friends who are getting divorced, becoming empty nesters and going back into the work force. There is so much in this book for anyone to benefit from.<br /><br />If you can only buy one \\"Self Help\\" book this should be it. Good luck on your own unique journey this book will help you create. ( Yes i know it is a little over the top but i really feel that strongly about this book! )
0684800713|4.0|In the shallow world of the characters of Ernest Hemingway, everybody seems to spend most of their time feeling sorry for themself.  Going beyond the tragic hero, the charcters are perhaps best described as arrogant and self-centered.  Coupled with the terse writing style of Hemingway, this makes for a quick read with a somewhat clever plot.    While bull fighting actually takes place in the plot, it is also a clever metaphor used in the story.  The main character Robert Cohn follows Lady Brett Ashley around like a stupid bull follows a bull fighter.  It is hard to feel sorry for Cohn when everybody realizes Brett's disinterest in Cohn except Cohn.  It comes to a head when Brett falls for the bull fighter and Cohn assaults his friends for viciously taunting him about Brett's disinterest.    While the main theme is somewhat clever, much of the other prose seems to be self-loathing and scenary.  When the characters get drunk, they pour their hearts and failures out like spilling wine.  Even when Bret finds her resolution, the reader could anticipate the downfall.    It is difficult to like any character in the story which may leave the reader with an awkward feeling.  The characters are depraved and infantile while searching for a love that eludes them.  While the search for an elusive love is one that readers can identify with, the flaws in the characters make evident why their goals elude them.
B0001WGDXK|4.0|Leonard Bernstein's series of \\"Indian Summer\\" recordings for DG included the beginnings of a second go-round with the symphonies of Jean Sibelius -- the First, Second, Fifth, and Seventh. They're all marked by often exaggeratedly expansive tempos, rubatos, and other indulgences; especially the popular Second, a bloated, belching affair I found hard to digest on first listen, but today can accept as an example of the conductor's unconventional latter-day proclivities...to be polite about it. However, Lenny makes a beautiful case for the First -- probably the most Tchaikovskian of the lot, but here given a singularly pointed treatment which makes it more incredibly dramatic than even the most diehard Romantic would ever think possible! I'm also coming to really love this most expressive (and often outr&eacute;) rendition of the popular Fifth. Still, it's difficult to recommend these recordings for a novice listener.
B000PKG6TE|2.0|Supposedly inspired by Josh's daily drive through Hollywood, the entire album comes across as a cold robotic dreamscape where musicians just play what they're told to over and over until the song ends with no variations allowed--no humanity.  From a strictly artistic perspective the songs may do an excellent job of capturing the hollowness of life and music in Hollywood, however hollow songs do not create an experience that ultimately proves worth listening to again and again.      The album opens with a pair of serviceable songs (\\"Turnin' on the Screw\\" and \\"Sick, sick, sick\\") that tease the listener of potentially stronger material to come, but nothing stronger ever materializes.  Most of the songs follow a pattern that seems familiar enough, with thought provoking lyrics based on word-play and with dissonant lead guitar riffs and heavy buzzing bass/rhythm sections (ie: \\"I'm Designer\\" and \\"Into the Hollow\\"), but further listening shows that the creative instrumental flourishes and careful craftsmanship of past albums are nowhere to be found.      When \\"Misfit Love\\" begins you may find yourself bobbing your head with the groovy robot-funk of the opening riff.  But about 4 minutes into the nearly 6 minute song (the longest on the album) you'll begin to wonder if the band is still playing or if they've gone to sleep and Josh is just singing over the same 5-second sound-loop over and over.  Most of the album retains this same rough yet sleepy vibe.  If \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" could be characterized as a nightmare-themed album then \\"EA\\" is easily classified as an album of empty dreams.  Though Josh's lyrics occasionally deal in disturbing imagery, the music from the second half of the album is mostly pleasant and relaxing in spite of QoTSA's signature droning guitar sound.  The final three tracks in particular (\\"Suture Up Your Future\\", \\"River in the Road\\", and \\"Run, Pig, Run\\") are perfect examples of this with Josh's voice and the entire instrumental ensemble blendingtogether into one big nap-inducing mesh of noise on each of these songs.  While they are all decent enough songs, placing them in succession at the close of the album makes for a very forgettable ending to \\"Era Vulgaris\\".      One of the things that made \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" such a captivating listen was the obvious influence of multiple guest musicians throughout the album.  However, much like \\"LtP\\", the contributions of guest musician's are completely marginalized on \\"EA\\".  Julian Casablancas of the Strokes makes a guest appearance as does former mainstay Mark Lanegan--and Trent Reznor even contributed backing vocals to one track--but you'll be hard-pressed to hear which songs they appear on let alone what vocal or instrumental sections they contribute, and Reznor's contribution was left off the album entirely.  (And no, that's not Lanegan singing on \\"Make It Wit Chu\\", it's just Josh giving a practically perfect--though not nearly as seductive--impersonation.)      \\"Era Vulgaris\\" has its moments, but in the end it's all about describing the current state of the entertainment industry.  Standout tracks such as \\"3's & 7's\\" and \\"Make It Wit Chu\\" purposefully underscore the complete mediocrity that permeate both the rest of \\"Era Vulgaris\\" and the current popular music scene at large.
B0002OERI0|5.0|There is a lot of excellent music here.  \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\\" and of course the title track are destined to be Green Day classics.  It is obvious these guys ave something to say, and this album spares no risks in delivering that message.  It challenges us, as Americans, to look at ourselves and society.  I love music like this.  It has meaning.  Green Day has reached their peak with this album.  They will never sound this good again.
B0000TB050|5.0|First 3 songs, Stuck in a Moment, Kite worth it all...Been 3 years, and I STILL watch/listen. There's a reason theyre famous beyond their singer...
B000O75F7C|4.0|Steven Wilson and his confreres have created an album of such pure expression which captures the torpid state of today's adolescence. Mr. Wilson's lyrical snapshots focus on the anemic and burned-out rythems which plague the children of a technological world in which sadly parents no longer rule. Porupine Tree have given us six beautiful songs to infect our subconcious and make our feet tap to instantaneuos hits even though radio stations won't touch anything outside their \\"formula\\". Although I will not comment on each song here, I must at least bestow praise for my favorite track \\"Anesthetize\\". It begins with Gavin Harrison's perfect rolling drum signatures which never seem  to let up and keep growing into such an explosive tune repleat with an excellent guitar solo from Alex Lifeson (Rush) and morphs into such a beautiful solemn ending - I never saw it coming. I have to admit, I cannot stop listening to this song. This album could be better than Deadwing (which is awesome)!If you have never purchased a Porcupine Tree album, start right here. It is uncommon to find music of this caliber! Start now and then pray for the children.
1582701709|5.0|Both my husband and I have watched this movie. The book is identical to what is presented in the movie, so it's just a matter of preference (book vs. movie watching) It is well done and we have both gained some great ideas on how to stay on a positive path, (the gratitude rock is one such example) and how to get out of the cycle of \\"negative griping\\" that comes with getting older.    I recommend this movie (or the book) to anyone who has decided to make a personal effort in improving their present outlook on life. Much of what is presented is common sense, however we all need reminders, from time to time, on how to stay on the path of positive thinking. I think EVERYONE should see this movie at least once.    -S. Mack  7-8-07
1843104954|5.0|Usually books on Asperger's Syndrome address the diagnosis and options for children: The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome broadens the field, using case studies and personal accounts from the author's own clinical experience to cover both adults and children, and all symptoms of the syndrome. From causes and diagnosis to differences in social interactions, perception, and mental health issues, The Complete Guide goes far beyond the usual Asperger's approach and is a 'must' for any serious health reference collection.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|\\"The Breakfast Club\\" is the story of five high school students(Emilio Eztevez's character of Andrew Clark,Molly Ringwald's character of Claire Standish,Anthony Michael Hall's character of Brian Johnson,Judd Nelson's character of John Bender,and Ally Sheedy's character of Allison Reynolds)stuck in detention for one entire day. Dissapointing and quiet,right?    Dissapointing--yes--quiet--wrong!!!!! The principal in charge of all five students,Richard Vernon(the late Paul Gleason--RIP)is nothing more than arrogant and stubborn. He won't let anything get in the way of the detention he is giving being harder than a bowling ball on one's foot. Add that together with all of the mischief that John Bender carries with him to the detention,and You've got more than just a long day.    \\"The Breakfast Club\\" may be a teen comedy/drama;yet,it is some of the best artistic work ever developed and pulled off. No doubt--without a question--\\"The Breakfast Club\\" has some of the most antic humor ever pulled off on camera. You'll laugh hard at a line of comedy you know was written in the script--You'll laugh harder at its execution by whichever actor delivers it.    What is it that really makes \\"The Breakfast Club\\" shine? On top of how well-written the comedy is,the drama is just as impeccable. Sure--its a trait that even \\"Happy Gilmore\\" didn't forget to touch up on. Yet,the remarkable part is how the drama maintains feels of darkness and seriousness all in one,not going overboard but making its intention,power,and prescence known. Don't expect anything Oscar worthy. Understand the concept for what it is,and from \\"The Breakfast Club\\",You'll find keen traits that are not only very hard to find--could have come close to not existing.    As you may have noticed,what you have here is a \\"special edition\\" of \\"The Breakfast Club\\"--a part of the High School Reunion Collection. The remastering is quite solid and adds to the enjoyment of the movie. It brings the 80's fashion and traits of \\"The Breakfast Club\\" to life so much to the point where the word nostalgia isn't crawling through your head. There are no real bonus feautures(unless you count the recommendations for a few other John Hughes films and the theatrical trailer for \\"The Breakfast Club\\"),though. The remastering is good enough to forget bonus feautures. However,if you are intent on bonus feautures coming along with \\"The Breakfast Club\\",you have come to the wrong place.    Overall,a memorable film that is enjoyable for all ages,and belongs in every film fan's collection.
B00005JMK0|5.0|But I want to repeat it againnnnnnnnn..  Put this on DVD. Period.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Although I love the Planet Earth series, and watching it in High Def is spectacular, it is very disappointing that it doesn't have the extras that come with the standard def DVDs.     This is especially true since one of the main selling points of the blu-ray technology is that the disks can hold more information! Also, considering that these disks cost quite a bit more, it is the blu-ray version that should have come with the extras.    It is strange that the powers that be decided to short those of us that choose to opt for the blu-ray version of this wonderful series. Probably, one or more of those powers should be fired!
B000MV9026|5.0|This film not only was a tremendous success for environmentalists; you hit about 11 various issues that were long overdue to be addressed in a film for young audiences.      Naturally, you are going to be met with opposition when you do that in any movie.      First, let me say that I have researched the time that it takes to make a film like this...the ludicrous comments that \\"you stole the storyline from \\"March of the Penguins\\" should be stopped right here and now.  From the information I have researched, this movie was in the making before the Iraqi war.    I believe the first time this Penguin issue was brought before the public eye through film making was in 1922. And it's a very poor tactic to accuse a film maker of stealing a storyline that is based on a non-fiction documentary dating all the way back to 1922; especially since any nature documentary is good material for animated movies for children. I don't know of any other animated Penguin movies for children except the one coming out next year.      Somewhere in the theatre audiences, there are many Mumbles and Glorias who will come forth in the future and step outside the box because this film impressed them on one or more of those 11 issues that were address in the film. You have succeeded and I congratulate you on this effort!    The color was fantastic and the penguins' facial expressions said more than the lines that they spoke.  My hat is off to the artists and choreographers! Robin Williams made a perfect \\"Lovelace\\" and Hugh Jackman played \\"Memphis\\" in a very special way.    This was entertainment for children at its best with the history, art,music and educational subject matter and there was never a five minute stretch that was not moving the plot along.    The premise was a young penguin who could not sing but could dance.  Since their breed of penguins sang to attract a mate, this put Mumble at a disadvantage.     The hardship that the penguins had to overcome as a group was starvation.  Penguins are basically starving in real life.  (This part is not fictional.)    Mumble meets another race of penguins who actually have rhythm in their movements and he blends in with them, but he can't find a true mate among them as the breed is different, and he would like to have Gloria.( a penguin who was born in his tribe of penguins the same winter he was)    Mumble decides that his social issues are not as important as the shortage of food for the penguins to eat and he seeks out to find some answers on why they don't have enough fish for food.  He spots a penguin called \\"Lovelace\\" who has a plastic six pack holder hanging about his neck.  This shows the audience another issue of repercussions of tossing wastes into the Antarctic have adverse effects on the nature there.  Lovelace swam through the water and it looped around his neck while he was small but as he grew older the plastic began to slowly strangle him.  (another issue)    Mumble helps Lovelace solve the plastic choker problem, then resumes his quest to solve the food shortage, sacrificing Gloria in the process.  He persuades her that he is no longer interested in her and wants to go out in the world on his own because he is afraid she will get hurt if she stays with him. (leadership values are played out by this little penguin star throughout the show)    In this attempt, to make contact with the humans (he refers to as aliens) he is captured and during his capture, he starts to dance for a little girl while he is in the zoo.  This brings some attention to him from a lot of people.  It is only then that the people decide to find out where he originated from, so they can study the other penguins.    Mumble is tagged with a monitor and released so that wildlife specialists can follow him back to his tribe of penguins.  The others see Mumble and Mumble warns them that he has been a captive of aliens who were eating all of their fish.  He convinces the others to dance for the aliens when they arrive.  The behavior of the penguins appears strange to the world leaders and and they figure out that the penguins are trying to tell them they they are not worthless and they need to be able to stay alive like other creatures.    The story is not subtle about what man is doing to the Antarctic and finally at the end it comes right out and says \\"Stop fishing there.\\"    At one point the scene jumps from Earth to a focal point far from the Earth to show how insignificant we may appear to aliens ourselves, and how would or should we react when they ignore us as we have the penguins.(another thought provoking issue here)    Many people took offense at this point of view, because some of the religious leaders first wanted to say the great Penguin in the sky would supply the food and not do anything to try to locate the food; but they did turn back toward a true fact and worked things out with everyone else. We all know that there are some people who misunderstand religion that way; but others do not.  Mature people understand what is implied here and should not take offense as some reviewers wanted to harp on that.    My point of view is this:  The producers had only one shot at it to make their point and this movie NAILED IT. Perhaps this review will help me feel like I have taken a least one small step in the right direction to promote a better cause for humanity by first opening a discussion about the creatures that live among us.    I appreciate all the actors who made this movie a success, and commend the producers for going through with something that they knew was going to cause great controversy and took a chance on being misunderstood.  (many people took advantage of that).
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|Great for a 14 year old boy...... Anyone else it is nerve riding... Very predictable. Marky Mark does look great in a white feather outfit in the end.... Save your money and see it on TV.
6304383827|5.0|Once more, filmmakers are to be commende3d for taking an ordinary boring book and turning it into an interesting comedy. The story may vary greatly from what the book was intended to express but I liked the premise of the movie. I finally read the book and was greatly surprised at the differences in it and the movie.  The movie is the winner by far in my opinion. However, it doesn't matter. The movie is what the the producer had the right to make it ...a comedy instead of a story about a busybody who schemed to wreak havoc at every turn.    The poor little rich girl has nothing left to do after her governess gets married but to try to \\"repeat\\" her success at match making by hooking up the parson with a local girl. The whole thing backfires miserably, and Emma nearly loses her true and best friend in the process.    There is so much in human nature and the nature of females during this time period that are still characteristic of women today. (Even though we have come a long way) I think the screenplay writers thought that it would be better to express the more positive sides of busy bodies given from the male perspective. Then one could understand the reasons why Mr. Knightly came to adore Emma.    The story was humorous and well written and the actors were all obviously selected to compliment one another. I loved Gwyenth Paltrow in this part and think she made an incredible character with or without any help from the \\"Emma\\" in Jane Austen's book.
0312323867|3.0|Although Emily Giffin deserves great credit for making an unlikeable character from the first novel the main character in this one, which presents a big hurdle in getting the reader to like her, I don't think she entirely succeeded in meeting the challenge.  Darcy remained very difficult to like throughout this novel, and Ethan's led me to admire him for his altruism more than see their relationship as anything real.  I have to admit that the London \\"scene\\" was quite a change from the NYC scene, and I liked the NYC scene much better.
0790720434|5.0|I have watched this movie several times in the company of small children who seemed to enjoy the storyline so well.    Mary is young girl from British parents who is born in India and when an earthquake kills them, she is orphaned and sent to live with an uncle in a very sinister looking manor in England.  She experiments to find secret passageways (all Gothics are full of secret passageways) but end up finding a secret garden instead. The housekeeper (Maggie Smith does everything she can to limit the child's actions but to no avail, as the girl has a mind of her own.)    The sad tale behind the garden is that the mistress of the manor died giving birth to an invalid child after falling out of the garden swing.  The garden is then shut up and forgotten along with the memory of the dead wife.    Mary, Kate Moberly plays a dynamic little girl who continues to explore until she discovers a groaning, crying sound in the night which turns out to be a bedridden cousin.  This cousin has been kept bedridden in error by the housekeeper who has misdiagnosed his condition to be something far more serious than it truly is.    Heyden Prowse could plays the crippled male cousin.  Mary takes Colin(Heyden) out of doors and eventually he walks.  The story is very predictable but nevertheless, done is such a way that it appear new.    This author knows how to tell a tale to children even if you can predict the outcome.  It is all in the storytelling and the film maker flattered the book.  This is a very endearing story...would bw great subject matter for children's classrooms.

B0000000KW|5.0|This album is the best of Ringo's \\"new\\" work. This is an INCREDIBLE record, and will probably stand as the definitive collection of his career's second phase (third counting the Beatles.) The definitive work of the early stuff is \\"Ringo,\\" but \\"Stop and Smell the Roses\\" is surprisingly solid. Reviewers give those his marks and I totally agree. But lets talk about T\ime Takes Time.  He had just come off of a painful stint in rehab, and hit the road with his All Starr Band. He is in as great voice as I've ever heard Ringo, and his positive energy can be felt. Also, he does all the drumming, and I think this is his only solo album on which that can be plainly heard and and appreciated. Obivously the producers wanted to showcase that for this record.  This album is flawlessly produced, and the songwriting is top notch. There really isn't a single \\"skip\\" track here. My personal favorites are the single \\"weight of the world,\\" and \\"I Don't Believe You.\\" This is good, album-oriented music. When this album came out, I was blown away at how much better it was than the current work of some of his other old-school contemporaries (not just his Beatles bandmates). I really can't say enough about this album, because expectations are so low for older artists phoning it in with terrible work and endless live albums. In later work,Ringo couldn't sustain the energy he displays on this album. His subsequent work has been split between a seemingly endless streak of live albums, and his later studio albums are good, but nothing as fresh or consistent Time Takes Time. Still, he's working and bringing joy to a lot of people. I would recommend his live show any day. I raise my glass to the guy for living clean and working hard... and to you for reading this review... thanks.
B000E5KJD4|3.0|To start, I have seen the Phantom of the Opera on stage two times and regularly listen to the recording of the Broadway Cast, so perhaps I was expecting too much...    The Good ---------- The opening of the film was amazing and really grabbed my attention. The sets were amazing and the costuming was great. They were really able to bring the world of the Opera House to life. The director very closely followed the stage production, which I really appreciated. Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine is gorgeous and does a great job for the most part with the singing. Minnie Driver does a superb job portraying the diva, Carlotta. The rest of the supporting cast were great as well (singing, dancing and acting). Now for the bad...    The Bad ---------- In one of the songs, as they are traveling on the Phantom's boat for the first time, they added a very unnecessary and distracting electric guitar part to the song. Gerard Butler was a poor choice as the Phantom. In some songs, he is successful but the rest he does a very poor job on. I'm not sure why they couldn't just cast the Phantom with one of the Broadway/Off-Broadway actors who play the Phantom. Obviously they can act and sing since they perform the part night after night. Perhaps, it was felt that an actor that had been in previous films was necessary instead of a stage actor. If that was the case, maybe they should have had Butler lip-sync Michael Crawford singing the part. In addition to Gerard Butler's singing, the Phantom looks \\"too good.\\" In the stage version, the Phantom's lip under the mask is noticeably disfigured. In the screen version, the Phantom has no noticeable disfigurement outside of the mask and is too much of a \\"pretty boy.\\"    Conclusion ---------- If you've never seen the stage version, you will probably enjoy this film. But if you have it on stage or have listened to it by the Broadway Cast on CD...you will likely be disappointed by numerous parts of the film.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is DVD gives honest and rare insight into the mind of a person with great influence.
B0006PV5VC|4.0|This specific performanace of this album is excellent.  The musical content is excellent and is a real crowd pleaser that anyone would want to listen to frequently.  The technical recording (Hybrid SACD) is muddy when played back on ordinary equipment.  That is the loudest passages are truncated (i.e. made quieter) and the softest passes are truncaded (i.e. made louder).  This assessment is made in comparision to my original vinyl LP of this same recording.  Presumably to get the best audio from the CD recording you will need SACD playback equipment.  If you don't have a decent copy of vinyl version I would highly recommend this CD.
006112429X|3.0|This book has an interesting premise and I like the fact tha the Nature V's Nurture discussion is brought up throughout the book. I realise that in the event of your Son going on a rampage and killing his classmates would have a negative effect on anyones psyche...I did however feel that this loathing of life and son became a little repetative and long winded...<br /><br />I just wanted her to stop the whole self pity and at least attempt to cope. She was so busy feeling sorry for her self, the most I could feel for her was sympathy, alas no empathy...So I always felt distant from her. Maybe that was Lionel Shivers plan.. Mmm..<br /><br />Having said that I was impressed by the end and was pleased I made myself finish it. I just feel the novel would be better if it were shorter..
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Awesome, amazing and unbelievable is all you can say about this series.  Especially in the HD format.  You can not believe the quality of the picture.  Although I had to purchase a special HD DVD player by Toshiba to watch this.....it was a gift for my husband's Father's Day......it was well worth the expence.  You can't even believe the picture and the stories themselves......about the forests, caves etc... are spell-binding.  It is an interesting and informative set for just enjoying or for teaching or learning.  Buy it......watch it.......You will LOVE it!!!
1594489505|5.0|I was not disappointed from the beginning. This engrossing novel personalizes what we often see as a brief clip on the news. We as Americans are so far removed from other cultures and the turmoil within other countries. I held my breath as the two protagonists struggled against their desperate fates. There were points in the story where I wanted it to end; so that no more misery would come to the heroines. As in \\"The Kite Runner\\", Hosseini did notlet me down in this tale of cruelty and commitment.
0151013047|3.0|I do not want to write a review that might be termed a spoiler, giving away what little plot there is. But listening to this unctuous sermon like his silent American target makes me want to run to the nearest exit, thinking that at any moment the \\"hero\\" is going to erupt as a throat-slasher.  The title of the book is a masterstroke. It basically tells you where Changez stands, even if Changez does not know it himself.  The \\"heroine,\\" Erica, is thrown up as a symbol of the Holy Grail, albeit Changez has no such beliefs: unattainable and totally shrouded in many layers of veil. She turns out to be a stick figure, without any personality.  The only humans with whom Changez interacts at all are his fellow workers at the super-firm by which he has been recruited. And they all end up as stick figures, as well.  And the person to whom he directs his monologue, a tall American who apparently is armed, never utters so much as a syllable.  I could write the sequel, in which Changez's allies behead the American on camera and we hear him scream as the knife slices through his throat. But that would make Changez into the unreluctant fundamentalist I take him for and would strip away whatever mystery the author has attempted to convey.
B00006CXSS|5.0|We had the Band of Brothers of VHS tapes which my father in law had described as the closest movie out there that actual shows what truely happened. In this day and age everything is now DVD.  I was so happy to be able to purchase this through Amazon as I trust Amazon and its vendors.  The Band of Brothers has special meaning for my husband since my father in law passed away and I was pleased to be able to receive it in time for father;s day.  Band of Brothers is a very good movie especially when you know someone who has served in the war.  Everyone needs to see it and remember what occured and what we went through
B000BRBA8S|4.0|Here's what you might want to know:<br /><br />Visuals: With Wong Kar Wai, always start with the visuals. Here's another collaboration with cinematographer Christopher Doyle that has resulted in a film of stunning visual beauty. Rich colors (unlike Hollywood productions) - striking compositions - all in service of the drama.<br /><br />Story: This story of a Hong Kong playboy and the unfortunate women who are drawn to him is very bleak and fatalistic. The pacing of this move is slow, typical with Wong Kar Wai. Atypically, this one relies heavily on flashbacks to complete the story. Plus, there is a fantasy sub-story (the main character is writing a scifi story) which I found of no value to the main part of the movie.<br /><br />Characterization: Some characters aren't well-developed, and their inclusion in the fantasy part doesn't add anything. Faye Wong mostly mopes around while looking very pretty. Gong Li looked glamourous but offered little beyond pessimism and mystery.<br /><br />Acting: Some roles in this movie are flimsy and not the actors' fault. My favorite performance belongs to Zhang Ziyi. Her's happens to be the best written and most sympathetic role in the film. But that lovely & lively sprite of an actress added facets and power. Mustachioed Tony Leung perfectly personifies the confident and uncaring ladies man.<br /><br />Music: Like Stanley Kubrick, this film is full of scenes where the music is as important as any character. Funnily, it's almost all Western music altho it is set in Hong Kong. Some Classical, some Nat King Cole, some Xavier Cugat.<br /><br />Note: This movie is actually a recycling of two of his previous films: [[ASIN:B0002X7GWU DAYS OF BEING WILD]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXUM IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE]]. Their stories are more straighforward than this one's. You might consider a more daring film as far as story structure. And Wong Kar Wai's technique shows more polish here.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|my kids can't get enough of this story-they act it out and view the dvd nonstop since new year holidays.  it is a wonderful product
0679805273|5.0|This is a fabulous book for any type of graduation gift.  I recently purchased several copies as gifts for my class of graduating special-needs Preschoolers.  Through their love of books, I hope that each child will remember me every time they turn the page!
0740748475|5.0|I used the recent birth of my Grandson as my excuse for purchasing this fantastic set of books. It didn't take long to realize that it will be many years before he's ready to appreciate the subtle humour and clever animation of many of the strips.  In the meantime, I sit and read a few dozen pages at a time, and just chuckle not too quietly to myself.   A fantastic package, beautifully presented, and books that will last many many years and give lots of laughs to everyone who reads them.  If you're thinking twice about buying them because of the price, all I can say is spoil yourself - you won't regret it.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Rós has done it again, and we the collective fanbase are wondering just what it is about that windswept barren rock that is Iceland that inspires the generation of ridiculously great music.    There seems to be a burgeoning dichotomy of taste with their music. People who like the albums ( ) and Von tend not to embrace albums like Agætis Byrjun quite so readily, and vice versa. Those whose do like Agætis Byrjun are the ones who will love this latest work.    I can't find a track on here that I don't like. The pieces meld and flow together as if watching a liquid metal body spontaneously mutate into changing forms. A completely solid effort, though if I had had to choose one piece as the standout, it would be \\"Hoppípolla.\\"    This is one of the ten best CD's I own.
B00007KQA3|3.0|Just coming off reading the essentialy Orwell (1984 and Animal Farm), I decided I could finally check out the film without any guilt of not having read the book already.<br />I have to admit, I was disapointed in alot of ways, and not just in the \\"it can't match the book sense\\".  First off, I was glad that the person I was watching with, and myself had both read the book in the not too distant past, or both of us would of probably been at a great loss on a number of subjects.  Many details, and elements of the 1984 world, while shown, are not adaquately explained, and would just serve to confuse the viewer more.  Elements such as the background history of the world, the thought police, newspeak, the Ministry's, the characters and their thoughts on each other, are all only touched on by minor scenes, if at all.<br />  In all frankness, the movie probably needed to be twice the length, with alot of narration to explain the world.  The movie often felt rushed, and the scenes at points butchered and the storyline brought to its most skeletal elements.  How they felt they would be able to bring the true horror and suspense of 1984 without Winston's thoughts, I can't fathom.<br />  Hopefully this will be made again, and it will get a proper full length that the classic novel deserves.  With age of fashionable radicalism in a political era thats garnered more than a few comparisions to Orwell's \\"Big Brother\\", its amazing that the time hasn't been taken to give this classic its proper film due.
0142407542|5.0|Bravo.  This is a wonderful book.  We loved the first one: The Gruffalo.  This is a very sweet and whitty book with great cadence.  My children love her books.  It is a must read.
0399229191|4.0|My 21 month old loves Eric Carle books.  She liked this one as well, but like others have mentioned it doesn't seem to hold her attention nearly as well as other Carle books do.  Her favorites are \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" and \\"The Very Lonely Firefly\\". The illustrations are as bright and colorful as they are in the other books though and the story is short enough for most toddler's to sit through.
0553582038|1.0|This book was ponderously slow, and a whole entire story arc should have just been cut (think; the Iron men). That arc should have been just mentioned in passing. Really lame compared to the rest of the series.<br /><br />also martin must have fun out of ideas, because half the book is literally just describing different tortures, rapes, sex, nipple sizes and colors, etc. Come on dude.
0446530573|5.0|I ordered this cookbook so that I could use authentic \\"Sopranos\\" recipes for a dinner I made for my husband and myself to enjoy while watching the final episode of \\"The Sopranos\\".  This is a fun cookbook in that it is written by \\"Artie\\" and contains stories contributed by other characters in the series.  I enjoyed reading about \\"Janice's\\" memories of Sunday dinner growing up in the Soprano household; \\"Bobby Baccalieri's\\" love affair with food and the many other stories included in the book.    I have only tried two recipes so far - the baked Ziti and the Tiramisu.  The Ziti was delicious but a bit time consuming to put together.  Next time I decide to make it I think I will put it all together the day before so I only have to deal with baking it the next day.  Tiramisu is probably my most favorite dessert.  This was a simple recipe and it went together in no time.  Next time I make it I plan to use cocoa powder instead of the chopped up chocolate and I also will line the dish with plastic wrap to ease the removal of the dessert from the pan.  Also, I couldn't find any ladyfingers in my area so I used a sponge cake.  It worked OK but after a day or so became very soggy.  I wouldn't recommend using it as a replacement for the ladyfingers.
B000002TLX|5.0|I attended both high school and college in the 80s, and I have to admit, Richard Marx holds a special place in my heart.  I remember the summer of 1989, when then-boyfriend (now husband) and I were five hours apart, and the song \\"Right Here Waiting,\\" with its opening lyric of \\"Oceans apart, day after day\\" seemed like it was written for us.  Okay, it's corny, I know, but who WASN'T moved by corny music in the 80s?  And the song that actually made me buy this CD isn't corny at all:  it was \\"Hazard,\\" a haunting, lyrical tune that captivated me from the moment I first caught the video for it years ago.  Plus, this CD shows that Marx can rock, too, with songs like \\"Should've Known Better.\\"  Overall, a fun trip down memory lane for 80s music enthusiasts; highly recommended!
B000GFLKF8|3.0|Spike Lee was once \\"the Great White Hope.\\"  American liberal intellectuals were ready to lionize a young black filmmaker qualified to \\"speak\\" for black America.  And he tried.  Regrettably, movies like She's Gotta Have It, Do The Right Thing, School Daze, and Jungle Fever - though interesting as only worthy failures can be, were so self-congratulatory and preachy that they resembled A/V Op-Ed pieces more than movies.<br /><br />Powered by a great true story and towering performance by Denzel Washington, Spike Lee did hit it out of the park once, with Malcolm X, since then it's been a pretty bleak season for the alleged vunderkind.<br /><br />With the Inside Man, Lee ventures into uncharted territory - an exciting, action picture with an interesting psychological twist.  To say he fails is to say the Germans lost WWII.  This failure is made even more remarkable considering how much help he has.  As with Malcolm X, the budget is lavish - this is a dressy film to watch.  Marquee talent is everywhere, Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, even Jodie Foster.  With talent like this, only an idiot could go wrong, right?  But Lee is a very special idiot, and he manages.<br /><br />Despite all the hoopla, this is a one-gadget movie, and by the time it arrives you'll be wondering if Reno 911 is on.  Not since the days of Marcel Marceau has anyone does less with less.  Christopher Plummer looks great and gives a splendid performance, but unless his character became a bank president at 12, the entire premise of the movie is blown.  Without that, the logic, motivation, and righteous indignation required to give this film any credibility at all are gone.<br /><br />The turgid pace of this anti-thriller gives Lee plenty of time to indulge in the sort of simplistic, heavy-handed lecturing for which he is known ad nauseum.  A little boy and his video game, \\"never forget\\" wall posters, a man and his turban, even breast size, all provide opportunities for Lee to beat his audience in the face.<br /><br />Of all this film's shortcomings, the complete squandering of Jodie Foster is most puzzling.  One imagines she doesn't work for free, and yet her character floats in and out of the action completely unexplained.  Washington makes the most of a bad situation, and Clive Owen, an exceptional actor, tries hard to carry the freight.  Unfortunately, there is no freight.film's shortcomings, the complete squandering of Jodie Foster is most puzzling.

0792839730|4.0|The biggest lesson to be learned from this film is what happens when large ego individuals are not properly disciplined and contained while legitimate concerns are ignored; things go too far.  In this case a Bridge Too Far with predictably disastrous results!
0393317552|5.0|This is very much a text book - and I slogged through it, maybe a chapter or two at a sitting. But the perspective that Mr. Diamond has on his subject is very enlightening. I would give it five stars for content, 3.5 stars for ease of readability.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I remember seeing Helen Mirren years ago in an odd thing called \\"O Lucky Man.\\" A wonderful film actually, but not terribly well-known, I guess. Anyway, it was a time in British film when actresses were expected to go topless so, like Glenda Jackson and the rest of her generation, dear, sweet Helen had to run around half-naked. Of course, viewers loved it. The point is that Ms Mirren has always been a daring, courageous actress, and I suspect it took a lot of guts for her to do the Queen. She is good, and the film isn't bad, although I suspect it will be remembered chiefly for the performances. The story is compelling, but the conflict seems very particular to its time, a unique and disturbing moment, but not one that points to universals. I can't help thinking that she deserves far more interesting roles. Like Guilgud, the great Shakespearean actor, if I am not mistaken, Mirren has Slavic (Russian?) blood in her, which perhaps explains her capacity for extraordinary passion. In this picture, it is all contained and repressed. I'd like to see it exposed.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I was very disappointed in this sweeper.  I actually got very lucky, because the day it came my sister in law was here and she told me that she has the same sweeper and she uses it for her tile floors.  So she ran over and got it for me to try so I didn't have to open up my new one that I had just received.  I tried hers and it worked o.k. on the vinyl floors but as soon as I tried to go on carpet runners or into my living room, it wanted to flip over. It wouldn't pick up anything on the carpet.  If you are using it for just hardwood or vinyl floors , would be o.k.  But definately no good for any kind of carpet, even if the carpet is low.  I have a Shark sweeper #610 and love that sweeper compared to this one.  The Shark goes on anything, even my living room carpet.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis always composed like a painter.....layering shades of color on a canvas, injecting a little light in the center, a bit of darker in the corner. He cops to it with \\"Kind of Blue\\", infering that the musical journey may include shades of blue, or other colors that complement. The mood might be kind of blue as well; or maybe not.<br /><br />The sound waves on \\"Kind of Blue\\" play like a rainfall pattern, a rolling brook, a waterfall, many incarnartions of water free-flowing. Perhaps that is where the blue theme came in. \\"So What\\", the opener, is probably one of the most recognized jazz standards, re-produced by many artists over the years. It evokes the sight of someone looking like \\"The Thinker\\", turning around and asking \\" I'm deep in thought... so what?\\" This seamlessly moves into \\"Freddie Freeloader\\", a tune that really does depict the lovable mooch of a friend, plying you with smooth talk and subtle requests. \\"Blue in Green\\" does seem to speak to a lover, almost a feeling of sadness combined with a little self-righteous jealousy. Truly, these emotions and nuances can be heard in the melodies.<br /><br />It would require much more space to describe the remaining songs, so I will leave it to the buyer to explore and interpret on their own. Suffice to say, \\"Kind of Blue\\" has attained classic status for good reasons. Music is one of the best forms of art, and when a recording achieves the task of being audio and visual, as well as emotional, there is something to touch all sensibilities. \\"Kind of Blue\\" delivers.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|unless you really are a professional, don't waste your money on expensive lenses. Get this instead. Its very compact but incredibly sophisticated and it has the most important feature needed in a flash - the ability to bounce off the ceiling. the flash head that you see here can rotate upwards to 90 degrees so that you can bounce the flash off of the ceiling. The difference it will make in your photos is amazing. Also, read Ken Rockwell's manual for  your Nikon camera so that you can configure it properly so that it will take  photos with beautiful warm deep color saturation. That combined with this flash is all you need.
1582701709|2.0|I picked this book up unaware of what it was about.  Rhonda Byrnes ideas are not new; she is just putting a new cover on an old concept.  I didn't mind the reading because it seemed to reinforce \\"positive thinking\\" books I have read in the past.  Byrne's had my interest till I got to the part about those who suffer disasters and people suffering or in pain.  It seems that her claim is they have created the situation and that the reason they are suffering is because they are not \\"in the right mindset\\".  I agree that the mind is a powerful tool.  I personally have overcome a tremendous amount of adversity changing my outlook of the world and what I can contribute.      But the more I read the harder it has been to finish reading.  Byrnes seems to want people to believe that their force is the only and most powerful force in the world, influencing what is happening in their life.  This is very hard for me to grasp.  There are bad people in the world that do bad things to other people.  People are not mugged, raped, killed; children are not snatched, abused, molested because they willed it upon themselves.  I would definitely keep this book far away from anyone that has had an experience like this, especially if it was something recent or that they have not worked through.      You're just not going to convince me that Donald Trump and Paris Hilton have everything they have because they follow \\"The Secret\\".  It seems that she takes \\"the Secret\\" to a level that is tipping on ridicules.  Perhaps this book is such big successes because the objective behind it is that there is no work, \\"just think it and it will happen\\".  Maybe this book demonstrates the American way?  Is this a new concept because it demonstrates what we really want?  We want it all and we don't want to have to work for it.         It is also very interesting the way Ms Byrnes uses quotes from famous scientists.  I really would like to know the context in which the small snippets she is using in the book are actually referring to.  I doubt these scientists wrote these comments in the context she is using them for in her book.      If you find that inspirational types of books help bring good things to your life, then The Secret is a worth reading.  I have to give it to Ms Byrnes, I am sure if you asked her she would tell you that she saw her book on the best seller's list and that is why it is their.  Personally there are other books written with a clearer focus on the power of positive thinking.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I love all of the odies from Sean Connery to Roger Moore to Timothy Dalton, but I'm sorry Daniel Craig was amazing.<br /><br />1. First he had a better script than most of his predicessors which of course makes things must more intresting for the actor. If Tim or Sean had a script this good they would have been Oscar worthy.<br /><br />2. Perice Brosan didn't want to play James Bond anymore anyway ok. I'm sorry he says it on the Die Another Day DVD. So for all you so called true fans out there saying bring him back he didn't want the job. Only other guy that honestly may have done half as good a job and fits is Clive Owens, not Peirce Brosan ok.<br /><br />3. Daniel Craig acually played Bond the way it would work in real life. Think about every single movie, every single magazine article, newspaper story, book, and tv show you have every seen about real life assissains. Now stop and think about it...\\"Did any of those guys sound like happy go lucky people who just pranced around being swave and smooth and just be your best darn buddy all the time? No.\\" Daniel Craig played the charcter like a real person not like \\"oh jeez I'm James Bond so I have to be super cool.\\" That is not how people act in real life espically not if their life was on the line. Think about it...if you were being posined, shot at, stabbed, beat up, tortured, being paid worse than a teacher, and not always being told by your employers(the goverenment) good job or even the full story of why you have to go on these missions...hey you would be pretty crazy and angry and whenever you got the chance you would take it out on someone. Thats how Dainel Craig captures...if James Bond were real...would he be happy...how would he treat his boss...how would he treat his coworkers...how would he feel about himself. There is a certain underlying self loathing that someone would have if they killed people for money, Roger was way to happy...Timothy almost had it...Sean had it but there was no way they would write a script back then where someone gets pyhsically tortured on screen.ere someone gets pyhsically tortured on screen.

0780624890|5.0|The more I see this movie, the more I really, really enjoy it.  While the entire Blade trilogy is wonderful, like most movies, its the first of the series that is tough to beat.  The sequals might be loaded with some great action and loads of other fun, but overall, its the first Blade movie that sparkles in many ways.<br /><br />The great things about Blade, if you haven't seen it yet, is that its like a couple of movies in one.  If you love martial arts and all out kick butt hardcore action, this is loaded with it.  If you like a \\"good\\" vampire movie, this is also that.  If you are into some pretty cool characters, and actors that do a fantastic job making them seem just down right cool, this is loaded with that too.  Perhaps the best thing, is Wesley Snipes, who takes a hero character and adds so much toughness to him, he almost could pass for a villain, and turns out to be just one bad dude who is extremely fun to watch.<br /><br />Although the film isn't filled with a lot of dialouge, I found the story to be enjoyable and very well presented.  Pacing is just fantastic in this film as there is always something cool happening, and usually, its a whole lot of action.  Every action scene is different, yet very well done.  Choreography is great and the fights come off as looking and sounding very hardcore.  Martial arts action is definetly present, and is best witnessed in a final duo between the main opponents, Deacon Frost & Blade.  It is a 3 minute fight that is fast, furious, and has some seriously sweet-lookin moves.<br /><br />Simply put, this movie rocks.  You will feel tougher just watching it.  Wesley Snipes will make you want to go work out and start learning sweet one-liners.  Blade is one-of-a kind for sure, and its hard to imagine this movie will dissapoint anyone.  Again, the best of the series.  Production of this film is just great all around.

0743437497|5.0|You got your Dickens. You got your Joyce. You got your Faulkner, Hemingway, Mailer and Styron. All of whom will more than stand the test of time. \\"The Shining,\\" Stephen King's finest, most terrifying and complete novel, almost catapults him into their ranks.    This is the quintessential ghost story, no question about it. The Overlook Hotel is the ultimate haunted house. But \\"The Shining\\" is so much more than just a ghost story. It is, first and foremost, a story about an alcoholic, written from the inside out. Jack Torrance is one of the great tragic figures in all literature. Having grown up in an alcoholic household, I can report that Jack Torrance, for me, was a living, breathing man, one whose behaviorisms were very real to me. His complete believability made the ghost story aspects of \\"The Shining\\" all the more gripping. This is that rare tale where the main character himself is just as frightening as the things that go bump in the night.    I first read the novel when I was 11 years old in the early 1980s, just after Stanley Kubrick's film version came out. I had never been so totally possessed by a book. I read it straight through, savoring the imagery, the characters, the scares, everything. And I thought the movie compared favorably, though even at that age, I recognized the big differences between King's book and Kubrick's script.    Having re-discovered the movie (and finding even more reasons to admire it than ever before), I went back and re-read the book, and was hooked all over again. Of all of Stephen King's novels, this one, I think, will stand tall as an all-time classic. It is not only incredibly rich in horrific imagery; not only is the climax BEGGING to be filmed, as it is, by a great director of action; but I find it is also a deeply layered character study, and that is its greatest strength. King knows these characters. He gets inside their souls, heads and hearts in a way few authors ever have. I cared about Jack, Wendy, Danny and Hallorann.I really, genuinely cared about them. I felt sorry for Jack, and yet I understood, on another level, that Jack was, essentially, a bad man unable to rid himself of his demons (no matter how much he told himself he wanted to).    Just an incredible book. King could  have never written another after this. (I also recommend the movie, which is actually more faithful to the book than some would have you believe. Kubrick simply could not possibly have filmed the hedge animals, the destruction of the Overlook, etc., because of budget/technological restaints. He still crafted a film that has its own meaning and relationship to the horror genre.)
B000002ARV|5.0|Johnny Winter made a lot of great albums but, to me, \\"Still Alive and Well,\\" produced with Rick Derringer, stands out as even better than the rest. This album marked tbe high point of his career.<br /><br />\\"Rock Me Baby,\\" \\"Rock N' Roll\\" and the title track are probably his most remembered from this album, but \\"Cheap Tequila\\" has always been my favorite. Another great track is the country and westernish \\"Ain't Nothing to Me\\": Like most great C&W tunes, it's all in the lyrics. And I don't want to leave out mention of the two covers of Rolling Stone songs, \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Silver Train.\\" Although it appears on the Stones' \\"Goats Head Soup\\" album, \\"Silver Train\\" was actually written by Jagger and Richards specifically for Johnny Winter.<br /><br />There isn't a weak song on the album and, with the CD, you get two excellent bonus tracks that weren't on the original LP: \\"Lucille\\" and a raunchy version of Bob Dylan's \\"From a Buick Six.\\"
B00005JPLW|3.0|I think it was Maddox who said the moment you have CG in every single scene is when it stops being Visual FX and just normal.    300, as was sin city and im sure other movies with frank millers name attached to them (sin city 2? ronin? who knows)have been clad ridden in cg to give it the affect that comic books have had in the past. To really bring that quality out.     I saw many frames in this movie (and shots) based around the comic book which i enjoyed, as will most other frank miller fans.     My issue with this film is how much was spent on the actual visual affects could have given them reason to develope the story a little bit more.     Just about the first 5-10 mins is the only well descriptive, well thought out and properly portrayed part of the movie. I feel if they had used a bit more of that tenacity with the rest of the script (a bit more, not over kill) we would have probably seen a better response to this movie.    I still really liked the movie and will order it for future viewing, I cant help though and struggle to see what is so epic about this movie with other people.    Its a good film. Its possibly a great film. But its not all that some other reviews might make it out to be if you are looking for more then a visual armada in a movie.
B000BTGY1O|2.0|This is pretty different from Capote's terrific novella.  They \\"Hollywood-ized\\" so much of it, that it could only be described as \\"loosely\\" based on...... if you have modern movie sensibilities, you may find this way too predictable and sappy, especially the ending.  I heard that Capote didn't think much of the movie, and I'm inclined to agree.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|I wasn't always the biggest Ryan Adams fan, but I remember years before I bought Cold Roses a couple of friends catching a concert of his - one friend thanked the other for bringing her saying \\"it's good I got to see him now since he'll probably drink himself to death in a couple years.\\"  Well, despite his rock and roll lifestyle, he hasn't drank himself dead just yet, and part of the reason might be that Ryan Adams seems to be writing two songs for every drink he consumes.  Cold Roses, a double disc (!) of alt-country tunes, is the best of the three (!!) albums Adams put out in 2005, and that's because, on the one hand, Adams clearly has talent to burn, but also because he's willing to turn whatever idea pops into his head into a conventional song structure, and luck was with him for most of Cold Roses' 18 songs.  You can hear that sense of drunken and whimsical invention on songs like, for example, \\"Mockingbirdsing,\\" an infectious song that makes the most of musta-been-brilliant-at-the-time lyrics like \\"Sing me what the lord was singing/ on the day he made the sky the color of the blues,\\" or a rambling coming-to-at-7-in-the-morning number like \\"Meadowlake Street.\\"  Then, there are songs that are plain brilliant - \\"Let It Ride\\" or \\"Dance All Night\\" or \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive,\\" any of which could be classics of its genre.  They sit side by side with the songs that are a little more drunken and a little more inane (\\"Beautiful Sorta,\\" \\"Sweet Illusions,\\" \\"Cherry Lane\\"), but if there's one failing of Cold Roses, it's not Adams' wild ways, but his predictable ones.  For all of its great creativity, Cold Roses suffers from aimlessness - for an album with the running time of this double disc, it's surprising that you could not use words to describe the album such as \\"sprawling\\" or \\"epic\\" or even \\"exhausting.\\"  The record ends in \\"Friends,\\" a great sunset song as bittersweet as any of its kind, but you may feel at the end of it as though you've gone nowhere.  As a collection of good to great songs, Cold Roses is amongst Adams' best work.  As an album, it seems like just another night at the bar.ction of good to great songs, Cold Roses is amongst Adams' best work.  As an album, it seems like just another night at the bar.
B000OCXFCO|2.0|I have nothing against politics in music. Even with many of Dave's opinions contradicting many of mine, and some of them even seeming outright confusing, it should have no bearing on the music. In fact, some great bands have mixed a satirical or political message in the music, examples are everyone from The Dead Kennedy's to Frank Zappa to Queensryche to the Beatles.<br /><br />Theres also nothing wrong with his being Christian. Many of the greatest metal artists of all time are or were.<br /><br />However, in those previously mentioned examples, the politics and message are broadcast in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the great music those bands made.<br />Contrasting this are bands like Ratm, the messsage getting whiny and tiresome at times, and the new Megadeth is another band that seems to have not learned the lesson of putting politics in music the right way, at least this time around. Some of these songs vocals are so annoying, that I almost had to turn off the album in the middle of listening to it.<br /><br />Enough about politics though. On to the music. This album is truly a letdown from The System Has Failed. It seems like that album highlighted Chris Poland, and even the \\"session players\\" like Vince Colaiuta seemed to bring that album up a notch. Also, the songwriting was sharp, and on THAT album Dave seemed to play with a passion that hadn't been seen since Rust in Peace or Countdown.<br /><br />However on this album, many of the songs recycle riffs from one another, the sterile production and mechanical sounding drums (not to mention bland leads) make it seem like it could have been recorded by anyone (and I thought that Dave + The Drovers and others= A real band now?)<br /><br />Overall it was a horrible disappointment. I don't think Dave + Co are done with playing good shows or being a good band, but this album was a real letdown. I was very bored throughout.
B00005JPKE|4.0|Before I saw Letters from Iwo Jima, I had every expectation that I'd find it a great film, and much to my surprise, I did not. Oh, let me assure anyone who might stumble across this humbly submitted review that Letters from Iwo Jima is a good movie, but it doesn't merit the term \\"great\\" in the way that recent World War Two productions such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and HBO's Band of Brothers all do, and this revelation caught me off guard. Even amid the orgies of death and wasted self-sacrifice in Clint Eastwood's tale from the Japanese side of the front, we have a sort of cinematic version of World War Two-lite which has much in common with 2001's Enemies At The Gate, another genre film that aimed for something outside its grasp. To single out Letters' worst flaw I would say it felt rushed, and it lacked those on-screen qualities I can only term heart and soul.<br /><br />The fact is Letters from Iwo Jima felt incomplete. It also seemed hollow. Whereas the real life battle of Iwo Jima involved many thousands of combatants on both sides, never when seeing this film did I ever witness more than a perhaps a score of Japanese soldiers grouped together, and even what could have been the immensity of the American landing on the shores of this mortally-contested protrusion of earth was underwhelming and hurried through. I felt I was seeing less an epic than an intimate project involving a miniscule company of players in an almost theatrical setting. I also felt let-down that the director ended the motion picture as he did, rapidly, abruptly, without meaningful closure. One more scene, even, of the featured Japanese survivor returning home to his wife and child would have added much depth to the climax of what was often simultaneously deep and shallow storytelling. Pacing was problematic all during this story, and nevermore than at its conclusion. Having anticipated much, I felt disappointed.<br /><br />There were strong performances in Letters and there were a few memorable moments, but as I've twice pointed out, despite a long running time everything felt forced and impelled toward brevity. The scenes of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi's time spent among Americans in happier pre-war days were frustratingly brief and inexplicably under-explored. There were more things wrong with Letters from Iwo Jima than there were right, and that's not how it was supposed to be: not in a movie this acclaimed and with this much inter-continental talent involved.<br /><br />I'll rate this much-discussed movie as four stars, but I almost felt it was closer to three.ble moments, but as I've twice pointed out, despite a long running time everything felt forced and impelled toward brevity.

B0000542D2|5.0|I own this dvd and watched it a dozen times I like it. You never realize how funny they can be until you have seen them in a movie acting. It reminds me about funny flashbacks of hotdogs and yellow submarine and other strange hallucinations. If you look at some of the actors in the background you might think of other influences like FZ or Bo Diddly. I thought the bonus stuff was mostly lacking though in the movie there was a lot of live and concert footage anyways. It was very dreamlike to watch in a sense it was unreal probably because it's totally black & white.

B000P2A256|3.0|I absolutely loved Maroon 5's first album, but this one doesn't quite do it for me. The lyrics are great, however, the song itself lacks original beats. I think they should team up with Timberland or another producer to improve the sound of the album.

1932907009|1.0|Heads up: suspicious 5-star reviews, glowing with cliched hyberbole. If you click on any of the \\"See all my reviews\\" link, you'll see that most of the reviewers have written only one review -- for this book! The 1-star reviews may be more truthful and telling.
B000007638|5.0|As an \\"I was there\\" Beatles-holic and later McCartney and Lennon fan (with and without Wings) - I can only agree with all the rave reviews about the performance, the selection on this set, and the great recording, too.    I have the LP with \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" and several live Wings concerts from my music days, on reel-to-reel tape, and over the years I have returned to a good solid (or melodious) set of McCartney crooning and rocking and sometimes even impersonating/acknowledging other greats. (On this tour, he did Elvis, Dylan, and Paul Simon I do believe; it's not been often mentioned, but there's an interesting rendition of \\"Richard Cory\\" on this CD.)    I've been programmed to love all the silly love songs, and all the basic rock and roll, as well as the classic ballads of Paul McCartney. They're all here. The only thing I'd add from my own first-reaction to listening through this concert (having been accustomed to a shorter version I taped years ago from a special television-FM simulcast \\"Wings Across America\\" special) --  There is one song which I'd not heard with this crystal-clarity, sweetness, and goosebumps of nostalgia: Bluebird. The tone and beauty of the guitar sounds in just those first few seconds reminds some of us of what an awesome balladeer McCartney was, even while he was busy being a Beatle and then post-Beatles rocker. (On the TV special McCartney recounts how a guitarist once asked him why he needed to go out on the road, being Paul McCartney and all.... McCartney said he needed to keep moving, to see that road again, and the guitarist replied, \\"Man, if I was Paul McCartney I'd *buy* that road!\\". :-)  The long and winding....    The classic McCartney and Wings Concert. McCartney, a taste of his roots, and some great music, well-recorded-  \\"a splendid time is guaranteed for all\\". (paraphrasing Sgt. Pepper, whose band turned 40, or 60, last month)
B000O76TA4|5.0|INTRODUCTION: Back in 1999, David Fincher had released his most controversial film yet, FIGHT CLUB. The film had an all-star cast of people like Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />STORY: Poor Jack has not been having a good life. He has had a busy year, he is an insomniac, he goes to several anonymous meetings just to keep himself busy. Every meeting he attends, a beautiful woman named Marla always follows him. She even attends the testicular cancer one (LMAO!). While on a flight home from a business trip, Jack meats a man named Tyler Durden. Tyler is a soap salesman, and after poor old Jack finds out his home has been blown up, he goes to live with Tyler in an old abandoned house. Soon, Jack and Tyler create their own club called \\"Fight Club\\", an underground club where people can hold fights. Soon, the project becomes controversial and turns into something called \\"Project Mayhem\\", a club planned by Tyler, where every night, each member causes destruction and chaos. It's only a matter of time before Jack becomes confused, and things spiral out of control!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw this back in January, and I thought it was gonna be the same old fight movie, but it's not! I couldn't believe what I was missing. I didn't know how amazing it was going to be! Plus, there's a HUGE twist at the end, that will shock you like no other, and leave you breathless!<br /><br />DVD: The Steelbook edition is a must have. It is packed with special features. Commentary tracks, fascinating documentaries are included!<br /><br />So if you like movies like this, this is a total must have!
B000I2IT44|5.0|I was almost afraid to watch this.  By some miracle, I was introduced to the music of Porcupine Tree just a couple of years ago.  In Absentia was my first experience, and I fell in love with the music.  For some reason, the music of PT touches me deeply and is like a salve for the soul.  So, I was afraid to see the DVD, because, other bands that I really liked alot, lost the mystique, or something, when I saw them.  But, not this band!  Matter of fact, I'm even more taken with them.  And that Steve Wilson is a hottie...  I highly recommended for all fans of PT.  As for anyone who's never experienced PT, well... You will either connect or you won't.  If you can, you don't want to miss the opportunity.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Guys, Dark Side Tour started in 1972.  I know, I have the London T-shirt and talked to a person who saw it live in San Francisco.  How can you want  DVD quality and criticise this movie for it's VHS feel when that is what makes it classic?   Read the description and if not for you fine, just do not criticise that which you buy and do not read the album jacket for.  To those who are mad it is not a concert video........This is why it is called the MAKING OF.  Want a Floyd concert, get RODGER WATERs redoing the wall at Berlin.   history.  I am 49 and in the 70's and 80's you looked forward to KFOG having a band on for the informal interview.  The best is when they all came on live. Heard one of Jerry's boys pull his Les Paul accoustic out of the safe just last week.  You remind me for those who criticise the product for what it is intended to be is people who bought an album that was labeled ACCOUSTIC and complained there was no electric guitar in it.  My nod of respect to those in the five star category. Check out the one star.  Kind of sad.  Dont bash unless you know what you are talking about.  Thanks for the giggle though.
1569242739|5.0|As a recent convert from vegetarian to vegan, this book was great in showing me all the yummy desserts I could make on my own. This is not your average cookbook. Isa has funny descriptions and comments throughout the book, which make baking cupcakes even more fun. Some ingredients are harder to find, but she warns you in advance and has a section for those sorts of cupcakes. A must for anyone who loves to bake and not just those with a veg diet.
B00008OE4W|5.0|\\"Sneakers\\" is one of my favorite watch-again movies, and I think it has the elements needed to become a classic: numerous stars; a tight, suspenseful plot; enough laugh-out-loud humor to make it lots of fun to watch; and plenty of action and intrigue.  The star-studded cast includs Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell, the late River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier, James Earl Jones, and David Strathairn, and each of them brings an excellent performance.  This quirky combination of stars plays well in the movie, with Aykroyd channeling his brother, who believes every conspiracy theory ever devised and Redford as the guy who gets all the dangerous tasks, or--as Poitier puts it--\\"all the fun stuff.\\"  Ben Kingsley as the maniacal Cosmo with his two cold-blooded operatives, Timothy Busfield and Eddie Jones, is just scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, while the other performers all add humor to the suspense.  Stephen Tobolowsky as Dr. Werner Brandes is comical as Mary McDonnell's computer date, yet menacing when he finds out her true identity.  This is an engaging and entertaining movie that lets the viewer into the inner sanctum of a group of exceptionally talented computer gurus with the boyish charm of high school geeks.  It has a warmth and vibrancy that are a bit unexpected for a movie of its genre, and there are few \\"slow\\" moments in the film; the action keeps moving.  The scene where Robert Redford unexpectedly encounters the mathematician's paramour is hilarious, and the one where Whistler drives the van is hair-raising and funny at the same time.  It's fun to watch for details such as Redford's using a Popeil Pocket Fisherman to retrieve something, right in the midst of a suspenseful moment.  \\"Sneakers\\" is still appealing after all these years, and someday when all the impressive technology in it starts to look dated, the movie will still be a good time.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara Bareilles is the real deal - she sings like a dream, rocks the piano,   and breaks out the catchy hooks like nobody's business.  Her major-label debut blends the funky, soulful edge of Aretha Franklin with Natasha Bedingfield's pop sensibility, but there's no question Sara is a unique artist in her own right.  If you're looking for smart, jazzy piano-pop that's easy on the ears but a step above in lyrics, pick up this album as the perfect feel-good summer soundtrack.      Lyrically and musically, the track list is solid, spanning ballads, kiss-offs to lousy ex-boyfriends and record executives, and the dreams and troubles of making it on your own. The production, while crystal clear, has its ups and downs.  Most of the time Sara's vocal and the many instruments work well together, especially the drums propelling the ridiculously catchy \\"Morningside\\", a standout track that has taken over my CD player.  Other highlights are the percussion on the bluesy \\"Many the Miles\\", and the gentle strings stirring in a great new version of \\"Gravity\\".  But I'm not feeling the production on two of my old favorites, \\"Fairytale\\" and \\"Come Round Soon\\", which sound cluttered and overdone.  Sara is the kind of artist who can carry a song on the power of her voice alone, and it's disappointing for longtime fans to hear it needlessly compressed.  At the same time, take this as simply a recommendation to see her in concert.  Sara's raw talent is obvious even underneath the bells and whistles, and this album still works as a strong introduction to a five-star singer.  Get ready to wear out your copy.

It also gives helpful advice on how to listen to your baby to figure out what he wants, instead of just jumping to conclusions.  I liked the EASY method also, which gave me, a new mom, something to start with to get on a schedule, while still listening to my baby to see what he needed.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|While many could argue that this isn't Van Halen's best album, it's definitely in the top three.  \\"Van Halen\\" was a landmark album for its time and still is today.  It introduced the world to the guitar wizardry of Eddie Van Halen and unleashed David Lee Roth onto the music scene.  One need look no further than \\"Eruption\\" to understand what makes this album so amazing.  Eddie Van Halen becomes one with the guitar as he pulls off this wonderful sampling of sonic salvos, firing up the listener as the get ready to hear Van Halen's cover of \\"You Really Got Me.\\"  Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about the first cut on this album, the wonderful \\"Runnin' With The Devil.\\"  It, along with \\"You Really Got Me,\\" \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\" and \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" are all staples of any true Classic Rock radio staion today.  \\"Ice Cream Man\\" serves as a harbinger to David Lee Roth's experimentation with dirty Blues tunes later on.  The entire album is amazing.  Is it their best?  Maybe, maybe not.  I'll let you decide.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of electric guitar work, hard rock, and anybody interested in knowing why the guitar solo flourished throughout the 80's.
0451528298|4.0|After a military fracas breaks out in colonial India, a mysterious (and supposedly cursed) Hindu diamond--the largest in the world--finds its way back to London. After the death of its owner, the Moonstone is only reluctantly passed on to the niece of the deceased: one Rachel Verinder. Less than a day after she receives the gem, it suddenly goes missing.    Collins' use of prose is marvelous, and his style of incorporating suspense at every turn influenced the writings of his dear friend, Charles Dickens. The story was originally serialized, partly during a period of intense physical and emotional pain for the author. There are glimmers of this, in the narratives of both Miss Clack and Ezra Jennings, two of the more entertaining and riveting (respectively) segments of the novel.    The story is only barred from a full five stars due to the mild loss of empathy/sympathy for two of the characters by mid-story, and the lack of pungency in the narratives of Franklin Blake, a critical section. That said, the story keeps you engaged from the very beginning, and it will be difficult to put the book down until you find out that thief was in fact...my apologies; let me excuse myself, before I go too far.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I just finished viewing the entire 5 disc series of the Planet Earth and I am totally in awe of how this entire series was filmed. The whole picture gave me a different view and appreciation of the wild and the entire planet. My children and I enjoyed watching every minute of this film, it's just mesmerizing.

0061122416|2.0|I first read The Alchemist as a teenager and disliked it and now having read it again (with inhibitions) in my twenties still dislike it. A minimalistic story (without the pleasure of reading other minimalist authors) outlining a boy's quest from Spain to the Pyramids and back again. Mixed in with alchemy, universal languages, souls, omens, and above all else fate - the overriding theme is to follow your dreams, etc. Nearly every noun is a symbol of something else and the overall idea of the book put me in mind of Tuesdays With Morrie or The Secret; that is, a single idea story loosely veiled behind the suggestion of a story. If you're looking for something less metaphysical/religious to read or simply another book with (some) similar qualities I suggest The Higher Power of Lucky.
1594489505|5.0|A well told story of love and human survival.  Not your typical love story, but at heart, that's what it is.  But that's certainly not all it is.  You won't be able to put the book down or forget the story once you've finished.  You won't be sorry with this one!
B000JLTR8G|5.0|I saw this movie on TV back in the early eighties but never finished it because I had to leave for an appointment.  Over the years, images from the movie continued to stay in my mind and I always hoped to catch it on TV again.  When I saw it was offered on Amazon, I took the chance and ordered it.  I wasn't disappointed.  This movie is a little dated, but the acting and story line is timeless--a man struggling with love and loyalty willing to sacrifice his own hopes for a higher good.  That's the inner story played to perfection by Mitchum.  On top of that, a good crime story combining a Judas' friend, Yakuza gangsters, and one good man trying to do what's right.  I don't regret tracking this movie down and finishing it 20 years later!
B00005LOLD|4.0|There have been some comments in reviews around the net about the picture-postcard look of this film being a little hard to believe. But I can assure you, having lived in Japan during the years the film was made and released, that this is exactly what it looked like then. From the military scenes, the big city, religious shrines and parks, to the seedy canal village.     What's hard to believe of course, besides Brando's accent, is the almost magical ability of a boorish, and not so subtly chauvinistic character like Ace Gruver to, within a few days, bridge the immense cultural and societal gap between the \\"Ugly American\\" and the cloistered superstar Hana-Ogi, and in the first date get a commitment of eternal love from her! Still, the ethereal beauty and personality that Miiko Taka brings to the role makes this improbable love story just as believable as any star-crossed classic. It's a wonder that Taka didn't get nominated too.    One of my yardsticks for how classic a film really is relies on how impressed I was with it as a kid, and 50 years later finding out how good it still is, even after I now understand what it's really about, and how movies are really made.    Despite it's few silly drawbacks though, this is definitely a minimum two-hanky date flick for couples at any level of involvement.
0743496728|4.0|I enjoyed Picoult's use of language (senses so sharp they could cut) but disliked the rampant switching between story time periods - zigzagging from present to past to future to past to present - it made it difficult for the reader.<br /><br /> The subject matter was intense and the characters stereotyped into cliques, which is so true in high school's micro society.  Yet the traits ascribed to each clique were too clich&eacute; and unrealistically narrow.  However, I cheered when Peter compared high school to prison since I agree.  As school shootings continue, alarm bells should be going off in parents' minds - what is really going on at school?  Picoult's book promotes the notion that symptoms are the cause.<br /><br />What are these symptoms?  Picoult alludes to unequal physical strength & stature, a lack of consequences and caring, a group mentality that rationalizes wrongdoing, and poor family dynamics.  These may provide a backdrop but are not the whole picture.  What Picoult does not underscore is the integral role that school environment plays.  She makes it seem that school is a benign building - a bystander that fails to take action against bullying.  What if the school environment is a causative factor in bullying - a byproduct of being in public school.  The stress of being in such a prison-like environment can cause not only physical symptoms but emotional ones as well.  We think that only adults have to go to prison.  Yet we send our kids to school prison without knowing its repercussions.  Today's schools are nothing like yesterday's.  Why is it not considered that student frustration with the school environment can evidence itself as aggression - both outward and inward?  We acknowledge road rage to be a loss of control resulting in aggressive behavior due to daily traffic frustration and stress.  We do not attribute road rage to poor family dynamics, physical strength & stature etc.  Is it such a leap then to think of school shootings as a loss ofcontrol due to the frustrations and stress from daily school environments?<br /><br />Teachers have all the power - like prison guards - with one exception.  Teachers also hold students' academic futures (and ultimately their career potential) in their gradebooks.  There is no teacher rating system in place (locally) like there is in college that helps to weed out those who are unsuitable.  During a school year at the local high school, the same subject is taught by two different teachers in successive semesters such as Modern World History A and Modern World History B.  When my daughter receives an \\"A\\" with one teacher and an \\"E\\" with the other, it tells me that grading policies are too arbitrary.  Public school can be a horror for those who cannot adapt well to its inequities, injustices, and personal violations.  A herding mindset is the result that thwarts creativity and individualism and promotes complacence.  Those who fail to tolerate it and refuse to be assimilated are branded troublemakers and outcasts.  The penalty is their future educational potential.  If our children live half their lives in such a stifling place, how can it NOT be a causative factor?

0393327655|4.0|(my first review was never posted so let me try again)<br /><br />I read this book about 1 year ago. This book is a very good start and a good introduction to questioning the value of religion and the impact of blind faith in modern societies. The essential thesis is that religious fundamentalism and extremism can no longer be tolerated in our world they are simply too dangerous. The author takes the argument a step further by pointing out that religious moderation gives credence to religious ideas and leaves the religious teachings \\"open\\" to interpretation and essentially makes way for literalism, extremism and fundamentalism which are the true dangers.<br /><br />The frank, matter of fact style of the book cuts like a knife and this type of criticism of organized religion is simply long overdue.  Religious organizations should be subjected to the same type of inquiry and criticisms we apply to any other public enterprise, there is no reason they should get a pass. Organized religions particularly in the USA are not benevolent organizations and purveyors of moralistic teachings or charitable work. Instead the ideologies they support sculpt public policy. The examples are abundant, here are a few: homophobic fear of Gay marriage (Leviticus anyone?), vetoes on NIH funding of stem cell research, the attempting teaching of creationism as science (which it is not science maybe theology but not science), the practice of funding for faith based initiatives with tax dollars.<br /><br />Mr. Harris uses historical events and very disturbing statistics to demonstrate his point quite effectively. (i.e. Only 28% of Americans believe in evolution (yikes!); 72% believe in angels.) I think this book is a very good starting point in the conversation and I certainly would recommend it to anyone this is why I give it a 4 star rating. However there are some themes in the book that were very questionable. Here are a few....<br /><br />The discussion of world policing of religions or the vehement anti-religions themes are quite fascist at times.  It beckons comparisons with the doctrine of Mao, Stalin or Hilter. Upon further discussion and examination of the effect of such policies purported in the book I do believe many people would realize that some of his ideas could be quite destructive and could lead to exact type of doctrine that Sam is trying to destroy. I realize that this is a slippery slope argument and not perfect by any means but give it some thought.  I personally may not believe in the supernatural or organized religions but I do not necessarily want the faithful believers destroyed or harmed, nor do I necessary look down on them.<br /><br />The problem of the vehemently anti-religious tactics used by Sam Harris is this approach to public discourse of religion will only make the \\"faithful\\" dig in their heels more and result in deeper illogical emotional driven argument.  I have experienced this first hand on many occasions.  In other words a more gentle approach is needed.  We need to be reasonable not polarizing and deliberately provocative.  A frank discussion between those who favor reason and science (like me) vs. the religious \\"faith-heads\\" (thank you Richard Dawkins) can and does often yield a meeting of the minds on certain points.<br /><br />The discussion on the value of Buddhism & meditation and the authors own spiritual practice really felt incomplete in my estimation. I am not saying it is not an interesting discussion but it really felt like a glaring hole that needs to be addressed on a much larger scale. The problem with this topic is that many of the authors who write books on the subject like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett & Christopher Hitchens can effectively reason and argue through the problems with religion; at times it is really like shooting fish in a barrel. I have read books by each author and their arguments are effective, Dawkins probably being the best of all....<br /><br />However, the nextquestion that needs to be answered is what is going to be the positive, moralistic, secular replacement for the organized religions we have today? There are positive aspects to religion like some of the moral teachings and the charitable work. How do we replace these in our society without the dogma? Do we need to replace these? Is secular humanism the answer?  I have my own ideas but I do not feel that book adequately addresses these questions. If we have experienced the \\"End of Faith\\", where do we go from here?to be the positive, moralistic, secular replacement for the organized religions we have today? There are positive aspects to religion like some of the moral teachings and the charitable work. How do we replace these in our society without the dogma? Do we need to replace these? Is secular humanism the answer?  I have my own ideas but I do not feel that book adequately addresses these questions. If we have experienced the \\"End of Faith\\", where do we go from here?

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I've seen 'The Shawshank Redemption' at least a dozen times, and each time it resonates with me for different reasons.  Like the characters in the movie, it seems that this is a film that can grow and change and evolve with the viewer.<br /><br />The first time I saw it, I was one of the few who went to the theatre to see its initial run. The Stephen King novella it was based on, \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\\" was one of my all-time favorites (still is), and I wanted to see how well it was brought to the screen. Despite changes in the story and in some of the characters, I found that Frank Darabont stayed true to the heart of the story, and magnified what made the story such a wonder to read. Simply put, 'The Shawshank Redemption' was the best adaptation of a Stephen King story I had ever seen committed to film, and it remains so today.<br /><br />And beyond that, on its own merits, it is a fine film -- very nearly a perfect film. It stands the test of time, with themes that are universal, characters that come to life immediately, music that strikes a deep emotional chord, images that quicken the heart and move the soul, and words that are familiar, yet new. In other words, this story of men serving lifelong terms in prison, in all its simplicity and unpretentious presentation, becomes something that nearly anyone can identify with...and something that we can all gain a measure of hope from as well.<br /><br />The story opens with Andy Dufresne going to jail for killing his wife and her lover, a crime which he says he did not commit. It is a common premise, one which might (in other movies) lead to an investigation and a story of justice returned or vengeance wrought. And while we do find out the truth of Andy's story in due course, it is not the main thrust of the overall story arc. Andy's story is a part of the larger story at work here, a tale of routine and of struggle and of the possibilities and risks that come with a hope for something better.<br /><br />I've mentioned \\"hope\\" several times already, and no wonder, as the idea of hope is one of the central themes in 'The Shawshank Redemption.' The idea that, even in the darkest places of the world, there are things that can keep us from madness and despair, and those things are to be found within all of us, as long as we do not lose the will to look for it. If you're thinking like a movie about a Maine prison in the mid-20th century couldn't possibly convey this theme very well, think again.  Somehow, this premise ends up being an ideal vehicle for a story about friendship and hope.<br /><br />'The Shawshank Redemption' is no metaphor, and that's where it gets its strength. The prison it is named for is treated as the hardest of stone-cold realities, and the characters kept within those prison walls are as real as a next-door neighbor. It's a specific story about specific people in a specific situation...but it is told in such a way that its themes can be applied to many people, and many situations. Such a good story, so well-made, and offering such a positive message of hope and (yes) redemption...why wouldn't anyone treasure this film?several times already, and no wonder, as the idea of hope is one of the central themes in 'The Shawshank Redemption.'

0060723513|2.0|My wife, a Holistic Healer, is totally enamoured with this book and it's \\"lessons\\" of life, living and healing.   After reading it, I looked for more info about the author.  Wow, the whole book is apparently a fabricatation to  make money and/or advance the ideals of  New Age spirituality.    If I had  known it was untrue from the beginning, I probably would have enjoyed it for what it was, a story about living in the desert and  native  ideas of living, one with the earth. However, I feel I wasted a lot of emotion believing her adventures were mostly true experiences. I had doubts numerous times about the truthfulness of experiences she described. She covers for that possibility by claiming in her Forward that the book was a \\"fictionalized\\" account to protect the tribe,it's members and their location.  I give it 2 stars because it was an interesting read about living  in the outback, and about spiritual  beliefs even if her story has turned out to be totally untrue.
B00005MP58|3.0|I must admit I really loved the Keira Knightley movie, but I bought the miniseries after reading all the rave reviews saying it was superior to the film. And while I agree that the BBC production is more faithful to the book, this does not necessarily make the final product better.     My main objection was to the casting of the miniseries. True, there were some characters which were played spot on: Charlotte and Mr. Collins, for example, and Mrs. Forster and Miss de Bourgh. Kitty and Mr. Bennett weren't too bad either. And although Matthew MacFayden's Darcy swept me off my feet, Colin Firth has put such a stamp on the character that it's hard to imagine him being anything but.    Having said this, however, I still believe the casting left a lot to be desired. My main complaints:    1) Mrs. Bennett was annoyingly shrill and over the top,  2) Lydia was too coarse and unrefined (yes, even for Lydia),  3) Mrs. Gardiner lacked authority. I couldn't imagine her character scolding Lydia for her indiscretion before the wedding.   4) Mary was too unattractive. She even looked like she had chicken pox in some scenes. Weren't the Bennet girls supposed to be local beauties?  5) Jennifer Ehle seemed to have the same facial expression throughout the series: a smug, supercilious, self-satisfied smirk, which looked pasted on like a Kabuki mask. This patent look rendered her Lizzie a bit too self-assured that it was a stretch of the imagination to believe she was, as she claimed to Lady Catherine der Bourgh, \\"not one-and-twenty\\".     But these to me were mere annoyances compared to the biggest casting mistake of all: Jane, who was as plain a Jane as you could get. Was British television running low on English Roses when they cast this production? I'm sure they could have found someone prettier than Susannah Harker. Honestly, the girl who played Miss King, whom the sisters dismissed as \\"plain\\" and \\"freckled\\" was a lot prettier, as was Jennifer Ehle, who played Lizzie. (I thought Rosamund Pike as Jane in the 2005 movie was a bit of casting genius. Keira Knightley is pretty, like Lizzie, but Rosamund Pike is beautiful, as Jane should rightfully be.)    Therefore, scenes like the one where Lizzie told (Plain) Jane she was \\"five times prettier\\" than any of the sisters, and (Plain) Jane just simpered without even acknowledging the compliment were downright laughable. Succeeding allusions to her supposed \\"beauty\\", such as Darcy's \\"You were dancing with the only handsome girl in the room\\" and Bingley's \\"She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld\\" were a constant source of irritation, as Susannah Harker, though pleasant enough, was thoroughly undeserving of such rapturous praise.     I mean, honestly, was I the only one who thought so? I only wish I hadn't seen the movie \\"A Knight's Tale\\" first, because Harker looks just like Allan Tudyk (the guy who played Wat) in drag, and I couldn't get the disturbing image of Jane snarling \\"Pain! Pain\\" out of my mind.    The final verdict? I wish I would've just borrowed this DVD set, as I don't think I'll be watching it again. The film is shorter and much more romantic. As for being true to the book, neither production is, so I think I'll just read the original.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I am a huge fan of Kellys...but I made sure to not let this cloud my judgment when I was listening to her new CD, My December. And I can honestly say that not only is this CD just as good as her Breakaway CD...but I believe, this CD is BETTER. I am a vocalist and have been studying music since about the age of ten to now, a senior in college, majoring in music. I LOVE all types of music...but to be able to find a singer that can give me chills simply by opening his or her mouth and hitting a note is rare and amazing...and Kelly does just that every time she sings. (Not that I'm saying I have some amazing ears or that I know *tons* about music...because I don't) :-) I'm just saying that I truly feel that listening to Kelly's voice is a gift from God. Many artists do not write their own songs. Not that they should be required to...they're singers - and they get paid for sharing their gift with us. But for an artist to write a song and share something so personal with his or her audience is amazing. I've written plenty of songs before...and simply having to sing them in front of my class and my professor is terrifying. I'm used to singing in front of people...but to share something so personal makes you feel pretty vulnerable. To share a song that you've written with everyone in AMERICA is absolutely amazing. In My December, Kelly wrote EVERY SONG...which is simply outstanding. Not only did she write every song, but each lyric tugs at the heart and touches the soul. I think this CD is for anyone...because no matter who you are, what music you like, or where you've come from...ANYONE can relate to various songs on this CD. I was afraid that this CD would be all drama and little or no pop; but Kelly did an EXCELLENT job balancing out this CD. My December has jumps around from slow ballads, to hard rock songs, to some hilarious, fun, catchy songs. I've listened to this CD on repeat ever since I got it on June 26th! Excellent job Kelly!! (As ALWAYS!) I hate that you had tocancel your tour...but please know that you have SO many fans (including myself OFCOURSE) on your side that know that you are guided by God and your family and friends...and you have and will always make the best decision for you and your fans! God Bless!!

0195073401|4.0|This compendium of introductory graduate economic theory was written in 1995, yet is still the industry standard. The game theory portion of the book covers about 10% of the total 970-plus pages, and can be considered the \\"common culture\\" of economics graduate students operating in the neoclassical tradition. It appeared later than most of the popular game theory textbooks (including Fudenberg and Tirole, Kreps, and Myerson), but much foundational game theory was produced in the period from 1985 to 1995, and hence is not presented in this, or any other, textbook used in graduate courses. The result is that the current generation of young economists is reared on a rather Utopian and uncritical game theory catechism.<br /><br />The authors ask the right question: \\"What should we expect to observe in a game played by rational players who are fully knowledgeable about the structure of the game and each others' rationality?\\" (p. 235) They begin to answer this question correctly, relying on the concept of \\"rationalizability\\" developed in 1984 by Bernheim and Pearce (the reader should Google references in this review, as I will not provide the full bibliographical details). They correctly characterize rationalizable strategies as those that survive the iterated elimination of strongly dominated strategies, but they accept uncritically the conclusion that rationalizable strategies \\"can be said to be precisely the set of strategies that can be played by rational players...\\" (p. 243). This is highly misleading. On the one hand, we have Basu's Traveler's Dilemma game in which the only rationalizable strategy is virtually never played by real-life players, even game theorists. Moreover, there is a wide class of games of strategic complementarity, exemplified by Carlsson and van Damme's investment game, in which there is a unique rationalizability strategy which is also risk-dominant. This will be played by real players only when error rates are large, and this is not because there is some failure of rationality. The problem here is that the concept of common knowledge of rationality is in some way faulty. Exactly how is an open question at the moment. Rubinstein's Email Game is another example of a game with a unique but absurd rationalizable strategy.<br /><br />The authors move on from rationalizability to Nash equilibrium. I believe this is a theoretical error, since the next logical step is to assume common priors and common knowledge of rationality, which Aumann (1987) has shown renders Bayesian rationality equivalent to correlated equilibrium. As Aumann and other authors stress, correlated equilibrium is the \\"natural\\" equilibrium concept in classical game theory, not Nash equilibrium. The correlated equilibrium concept is also a bridge to a game-theoretic analysis of social institutions and \\"social epistemology.\\"<br /><br />The book's defense of the Nash equilibrium concept is (justifiably) half-hearted, and does not include the strongest justification, from evolutionary game theory (there is no evolutionary anything in this book, much less evolutionary game theory). There is no satisfying justification of the Nash criterion in this book at all, in fact. However, the problems with Nash equilibrium are discussed only in passing, if at all. For instance, the authors never even try to defend the notion that a player will play a mixed strategy in a one-shot game! There are strong defenses of this notion by Harsanyi (the Purification Theorem) and Aumann (Nash conjectural equilibrium). These defense are themselves faulty, accepted by game theorists only because there is nothing better. But, the authors could have broached the subject.<br /><br />The book makes a half-hearted attempt to deal with the equilibrium refinement literature, and weakly defends perfection, subgame perfection, and sequentiality. Most economists have learned in graduate school that rationality implies backward induction (subgame perfection) even though there is no justification for this view in the primary literature. The authors do little to dispel this notion, although they do present the Centipede Game as an example where backward induction may not be justified. In fact, backward induction can rarely be justified on rationality (or any other) grounds in games where players move two or more times along the equilibrium path of play, except in special circumstances.<br /><br />In sum, the treatment of game theory is competent but limited, and not intellectually exciting, because the authors do not convey the deep challenges that the commitment to explaining strategic behavior on the basis of Bayesian rationality presents to the game theorist. The problematic status of game theory in its current instantiation are thereby glossed over, so that the deep epistemological problems recognized by professional game theorists are not reflected in the use of game theory by applied practitioners.he primary literature.

The problem is that it's that same one-sided and biased approach that prevents the thinking viewer from enjoying the show!  If the Balkans is what you had in mind, check out \\"Pretty Village, Pretty Flame\\" and \\"Savior\\" starring Dennis Quaid and Nastassja Kinski, and stay clear of \\"Welcome to Sarajevo.\\"
B000PTYP5C|5.0|This album has a new producer in some songs they sound more like Rush who the producer also produces.  The singers (James) voice isn't as dynamic as previous albums.  Love the album but sound isn't as good as previous albums the new producer has taken away the dynamic features that I loved in this band, strong vocals, sort of blended all of the instruments into a flat sound.  I know this band sounds much better in person.  Nothing wrong with the bands part just the production.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|Beautifully crafted and tempered gem by a band reminiscent of Tindersticks. \\"Boxer\\" is a special album...rich, lush and atmospheric baroque pop.  Every track is a keeper.  In my top 5 for 2007.
B00026WU7I|5.0|every song here is a gem, but to perfectly honest, i dont care for dylan's shrill singing on idiot wind, it just seems out of character on this generally mellow, plaintive album.  probably his most timeless album, the songs (with the possible exception of idiot wind) are still musically and lyrically relevant.
1400063515|4.0|Nassim is a Trader with a sloppy writing style. Taleb has an interesting points about non-normality of the world and model risk, his writing style is unexciting as he goes in excessive lengths to explain simple ideas. According to the book, Nassim's mother believes that he is a little over his head.  The book is full of bad mouthing, harshly criticizing scholars that disagree with the author. Nassim has some interesting examples of anomalies in rational behavior, however nothing unfamiliar for people in the quantitative finance community.  I must admit this book was much better than his earlier work \\"Fooled by Randomness\\"  and he has come a long way on his path to becoming a Philosopher.  Having disliked his previous book, I have come to like this book and recommend it to the non-qunat types.
B000PC6Z48|5.0|i am more of an horror movie fan then western but since i love italian horror movies so much i taught it would be fair to give this movie a chance (+ im a big big fan of sergio leone movies) and i was not disapoited . alot of action, gun fight, bar fight etc . nice sets and Franco Nero is very good. you wont beleave wath is in the coffin......<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie to any western spaghetti fan, you wont regret it.
B000005JAK|5.0|...and from the first blast, it was the best!  I admit it was a little noisy hearing Crystal come through the stereo, but by the end, with the lead hook wrapping up the tune, I knew these guys were exceptional.  It only got better.  I worked back from here, with New Day Rising my second album from these guys; another must have.  This is not just punk, this is song writing, performance, and production of the highest caliber from any genre.  10 Stars, from one of my all time favorite bands.
0451191153|5.0|This is a very good book.  Would I call it incredible, nuanced, beautiful art exposing the foibles and contradictions of the human condition?  Hardly.  But if you encounter Rand understanding the world in which she was raised- Communist Soviet Russia- all her works become flagrant, indeed beautiful manifestations of how important it is to honor an individual's life, ideas, work, and soul.  The Fountainhead is an enduring testament to the importance of the free-market, and a disturbing reminder of those regimes who laid waste to millions of human lives.

B00005JPHT|5.0|Whether you like Moore or not, I think every American should see this movie. It shows us what's possible with our wealth: Making sure every American (including children) has the opportunity to be healthy. It's pathetic that the US is the only country that doesn't provide this basic right to people. Really makes one think...
B00006SFLV|5.0|This DVD set is worth whatever you pay for it unless you are  completely uninterested in the pain of adolescence, which is what this series is about, and not whether you are Angela or Angela is you.I first watched this show when I was in my forties and am seeing it again in my sixties.  I find I remember every episode almost word for word,  The writing is that good.    Each character has his or her own pain. My favorite character, and I believe the second lead, is Brian, whose pain is loneliness.  His parents, both psychologists, are absent.  He spends his time alone riding his bike, studying, obsessing about Angela and doing everything he can to make her happy (often against his better judgement) while  bad boy Jordan merely \\"needs\\" her.  Brian is not, as has been posited in a pri or review, a selfish character,but a confused one who can do cruel things but is essentially decent and kind.    The most upsetting thing about the series is that there is no ending episode to provide closure.  It ends in the middle of various story arcs.My conclusion as to the ending for Angela (there is no clue as to what happens to Rayanne or Ricky or even Jordan)is based on the fact that Angela's teenage rebellion mirrors her mother's. Both surrounded themselves with unlikely friends--Patty's roommate was a lot like Rayanne, and died from an overdose.  Her boyfriend Tony was a lot like Jordan (and, in the last episode, does not even show up when supposed to).  Patty says \\"There comes a time to give up fantasy for reality.\\"  She therefore married Graham, whom she also knew in high school.  The English teacher (introduced late in the series and left hanging) reads from Shakespeare about a beloved who is, according to answering student Brian \\"real\\" rather than beautiful or outstanding. Jordan silently concu    Angela, like Cyrano's Roxanne, realizes that she \\"loves' the letter she has received from Jordan, and then realizes that Brian has written it.  She almost swoons into a kiss with Brian but they are interrupted by Jordan.  Whether or not she ends up sleeping with Jordan, as so many reviewers wonder, is unimportant.  Just as her mother slept with four boys before marrying Graham, Angela will ultimately face reality and marry Brian, who is devoted to her, can have a converstion, will love her (and fight the temptation of affairs) despite her flaws, and be a stable, laid back man able to support her in her suburban lifestyle.  This show is great because the characters, Angela, her parents, Rayanne, Ricky (a revelation to TV audiences at the time), Sharon, Brian, and Danielle, are so real that you KNOW them! What happens to them matters!  Buy it!
0743496728|4.0|I put off reviewing this book b/c I just didn't really know what I thought.  I guess it disturbs me that Picoult somehow made me feel sorry for this kid, when in reality I never feel sorry for the kids that do these kind of things.  Having children of my own, this was a hard read.  Made me think too much, which is what a good book is supposed to do.  It was a good, but not quite up there with \\"The Pact\\" or \\"My Sister's Keeper\\".
B00003CXAA|5.0|Disc 1 The Godfather<br />Disc 2 & 3 The Godfather Part II<br />Disc 4 The Godfather Part III<br />Disc 5 Bonus Materials<br /><br />For those perhaps too young, and for those who just haven't had the pleasure yet, this is the film box set above all others you should own. The first two films are two of greatest films ever made. Indeed The Godfather is ranked No.1 and The Godfather II is ranked No.3 in the IMDB.com rankings as of today. Bare in mind that these films were made over 30 years ago and that is some achievement.<br /><br />Part 3 is not a bad film, and by normal film standards is pretty good. However in comparison with the first two its not in the same class, and doesn't merit repeated viewings in the same way as 1 & 2.<br /><br />The bonus disc contains a lot of interesting stuff:<br />Behind the Scenes (on location, music, screenwriting, auditions, storyboards, cinematography etc),<br />Additional Scenes<br />Family Trees<br />Trailers<br />Academy Award speeches!<br />Biographies.<br /><br />If that doesn't convince you that you're getting good value for money, then perhaps when I tell you the total running time of all 5 discs is 710mins will (thats almost 12hours). Unlike some boxed sets the box itself is not made of thin card, and is quite sturdy - looks good on the shelf as well.<br /><br />Think I'll start from the beginning again now...
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This is one my all-time favorite movies for several reasons.  First, the cast: Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, and Clive Owen are perfect as the main triangle of personae in this film. Next is the plot; if you have the ability to go into this one without knowing anything about the plot, then do so because the end is just fantastic.  The even, fast pace of this film will keep your attention.  Enjoy.

630469654X|5.0|I always enjoy watching Ladyhawke, it's such a great, timeless story of love and adventure.  Rutger Hauer, Matthew Broderick and Michelle Pfieffer were clearly perfect for the parts in this film.  The story of star-crossed lovers is classic but Broderick (as well as the 80s synth score) add a great sense of humor to the plot.  Definitely a must-have for your DVD collection.  Enjoy.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Ok, I think by now we have all figured out that global warming is a huge issue, and just like other things going on with our planet (civil war, genocide, etc.) we probably will do nothing about it.  Al Gore has effectively put together an apolitical review of the impact our way of life is having on the atmosphere and how this affects the climate and ultimately, us.  Gore knows what he's talking about and has clearly done a lot of research on this issue considering that he has said he will not seek office again because he wants to focus on this inconvenient truth.  This is a great lecture on DVD that everyone should see.  Maybe it will make some people think differently about the way we live our lives and admit that there is a problem and possibly begin to do something about it.  And those are the first steps toward recovery.  Enjoy.
B000M4RG42|1.0|With Clint Eastwood as director and Steven Spielberg as producer I was really expecting to watch a movie that would be on par with Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, I was severely disappointed!<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I have the utmost respect for those that fought on the Battle if Iwo Jima, I can't imagine the real horror it must have been to be there.<br /><br />In telling the story of the \\"flag\\", which was probably very accurate I felt that the movie was very disjointed in its bounces between timeframes.  From the battle to the fund raising events, back and forth, back and forth I was not able to enjoy any continuity in the story.  Just when I was starting to bite my nails in a combat scene it would jump into some stadium full of people and a reenactment of the flag raising.  I would slump in my seat and wonder why I had let the tension build up inside only to be let down like this.<br /><br />Watching a drunken American Indian rant and rave throughout the movie was most disappointing.  While that may have been the fact, I didn't find the portrayal anything but depressing, which in many ways was the way that I left the theater, depressed, wondering in whose pocket my $10 would land.<br /><br />I'm guessing if you read the book and saw the movie you might be very happy with the performance. My expectations far outweighed this movies ability to deliver any type of gripping story, fulfilling battle scenes (as both director and producer have delivered in the past) or feeling that at the end I was a better person for having watched such a sad reel of film.
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good action movie.  Michael Pena clearly saves this film from being a total waste of time with his mildy-eccentric role as a newbie federal agent.  The plot is extremely unrealistic.  Overall Shooter is worth a rental at least to see the magnificent display of firearms and explosions, because that's really all there is to it. Enjoy.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST WAS IN THE THEATRES AND  I HAVE TO SAY I WAS DISAPPOINTED. IT WAS A LITTLE DEPRESSING FOR MY TASTE. WHEN IT WAS RELEASED ON DVD I ORDERED THE 2 DISC SET. I WATCHED THE MOVIE AGAIN AND TO MY AMAZEMENT, I LOVED IT. THERE A LOT OF THINGS I MISSED THE FIRST TIME AROUND. SO WHAT IF THE ORIGINAL ACTORS ARE OLDER THAN WHEN THEY WERE ON BROADWAY. AT LEAST THIS MUSICAL HAD ALL BUT 2 ORIGINAL CAST MEMBERS AND IT SHOWED THEIR CAMRADERIE AND THEY INVITED US TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH THEM. I REALIZED THIS WAS A CELEBRATION OF LIFE. THIS IS A UNIVERSAL THEME NO MATTER WHETHER IT'S THE 80'S OR 2006/07. THE DOCUMENTARY ON THE COMPOSER AND PLAYWRIGHT WAS TOP NOTCH AND YOU REALIZE WHY HE LABORED SO HARD ON THIS MUSICAL. IT'S JUST SO SAD THAT HE NEVER GOT TO SEE HIS DREAM OPEN ON BROADWAY. I BELIEVE FOR THE ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE, IT WAS A LABOR OF LOVE FOR HIM. I'VE WATCHED IT 5 TIMES AND I'M STILL NOT SICK OF IT.
B0001KZM3O|1.0|The CD came quickly and looked like new all wrapped up, but instead of \\"The Final Cut\\" it was \\"Amused to Death\\", which would not have been so bad if I didn't already have that CD.  I will not deal with them again.
B000O174CM|5.0|I JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE LAST NIGHT AND ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW. I NEVER GOT TO SEE THE BROADWAY SHOW, BUT THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC. JENNIFER HUDSON IS A TRUE DIVA IN THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD. SHE JUST DIDN'T ACT SHE CHEWED UP THE SCENERY AND SPIT IT OUT AND ALL THE ACTORS COULD DO IS SIT THERE AND WATCH IN AMAZEMENT. WHY SHE WASN'T NOMINATED FOR BEST ACTRESS I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE WAS THE STAR OF THE MOVIE. HER PRESENCE WAS MADE KNOWN FROM THE FIRST SCENE AND JUST DIDN' T STOP. HER RENDITION OF \\" I AM TELLING YOU \\" WAS GUT WRENCHING. WHEN SHE WAS NOT ON THE SCREEN YOU MISSED HER. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE REST OF THE CAST WAS NOT GOOD, BUT THEY WERE OVERSHADOWED BY MS. HUDSON'S PRESENCE. THIS WAS A HOLLYWOOD MUSICAL AT IT'S BEST. BUY IT. WATCH IT OVER AND OVER. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
B00000DATR|5.0|Wonderful music, diverse yet still very much Mike Oldfield.  If you love Tubular Bells I then you need this one.  It has some hints of the original but they are only hints.  This is a fubulous music all on its on.
B00005ASOC|4.0|Good movie about the reclusive writer of \\"the\\" great American novel and a bright kid from the hood; and their impact on each other.  I would watch it again because it is a good \\"feel good\\" story, with very good performances.  There are unusual ups and downs the characters must face.  I would rate this 3.5 stars.

B000NA1OXY|5.0|What an awesome CD! Avril at her best. I like everysong, except when your gone. but I don't get it. People keep trashing this CD. Ok this is kinda like a Christina Aguilera thing. Christina got married, and made a double album of happy songs, shes happy now. and thats my first thought with Avril, she got married, she is happy now,a nd her and her husband worked together on this album. So it's more poppy and fun than her last 2 albums. It's like if Madonna made everyone of her albums with the same sound. it would get boring. thats why artist try new things, and Avril made a great album, still punk rockish and a bit poppy. I like it. now the standard version is clean, but the deluxe version with the dvd is not, but the first 2 tracks are the only ones with language. over all a fun and great album. a new side of avril. enjoy it!
0743454537|5.0|If you are under the age of 18, do you own the rights of your body? Imagine that all your life you have been subjected to medical procedures to help save your older sister's life.  Imagine that you come to realize that the only reason your parents decided to have you was to help save your sister's life.  At what point do you say, \\"Enough\\"?  At what point do you decide that your body is yours to protect, even if it means the possible death of your sister? At what point should a parent stop helping one child, in order to help the other?     My Sister's Keeper deals with these various topics.  This is the story of Anna, aged 13, who hires a lawyer to protect her own rights and to stop her parents from using her body to save her sister's. Her sister Kate is battling a form of leukemia and can die. Anna comes to find out that she was genetically engineered to be her sister's perfect match. My Sister's Keeper presents multiple sides to this story, as each chapter is presented from a different person's point of view.  This heart wrenching battle forces readers to think about their own opinions. Up until the very end, readers are deciding which side they are on.  The surprising ending will bring about a perspective the reader hadn't anticipated! The ending of My Sister's Keeper definitely brings about the \\"Wow\\" factor!

1572705485|5.0|Hi, I'm glad to share my opinion on the book. It's very funny and entertaining. As far as I understand that's what classic British humor should sound like. I would highly recommend this book to everybody who likes this type of literature.
032147404X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I am a fan of Scott Kelby books, especially the \\"Killer Tips\\" series.  I highly recommend them for any Photoshop and Illustrator users. This book is in the same kind of format, and is clear and concise.  Yes, his humor is a little silly, but after the first chapter it's only the first page of each section.  Some reviewers made it sound like that was the entire book, and that is just not the case.  I would not recommend this book for advanced users though. It's a great jumping off point for beginners because it gives some general guidelines and settings for several photo situations.  It is easier to know what buttons to push to get a great photo, then learn why those settings work.  And this book will help you do that.

0780622553|5.0|A few days ago, while watching Transformers, I told my son that Megan Fox looks like a \\"young Jennifer Connelly.\\"<br /><br />\\"Who?\\" he said.<br /><br />I could only laugh. Then tonight we watched the rented \\"Dark City\\" and I said to him \\"that's her!\\" and he immediately said \\"the girl from Transformers?\\"<br /><br />Yes, her. Jessica Rabbit in the flesh. Enough reason to watch. &lt;Grin><br /><br />What a fantastic movie. It's a coincidence that my membership in a certain  movie rental company shipped me this film so soon after watching Transformers. Let's call it synchronicity.<br /><br />It's the first time I watched this film since I saw it in theaters 9 years ago and it still left a huge impression on me. There are major spoilers ahead so if you haven't seen this then skip the rest. Just remember this; if you are a fan of sci-fi then find a way to watch this film. It is worthy of ownership so don't be afraid of ordering it from Amazon. You will not regret it.<br /><br />My son and I discussed many questions about this film at the end. Earth is never once mentioned, simply \\"a blue planet on the edge of the galaxy.\\" So we don't really know where these people actually came from.<br /><br />Was it Earth? Were the memories implanted the real memories of humans? Is the planet at the end a re-creation of Earth or is it the real Earth we now know?<br /><br />This film just works on so many levels that it leaves your head spinning. Others have mentioned the film noir element and the movies it has influenced since its release.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Buy it.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Even my mother-in-law likes it!  And, not going for the 14th selection makes it a very reasonable purchase/gift.
1577314808|5.0|This book should not be mistaken for just another self-help book, of which there are more than enough.  Rather, Eckhart Tolle has correctly isolated the key concept behind numerous philosophies and religions, the importance and significance of the 'now' moment, and what it really means to spend time in this state.  Those who have voted low for this book have missed out on the spiritual classic of the decade.  However, we are all at different points in our spiritual evolution, and it's hardly likely that every reader will be ready for its message.
B000002KK2|5.0|I discovered this album just before \\"Doyt Doyt!\\" began appearing on t-shirts in and around Toronto, and was so pleased to see it get popular. I remember her singing selections on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" too.    I had it on vinyl, I replaced it on CD. It's one of my most played CD's. I can't live without it. I have nothing bad to say about any one of its shimmering, jazzy, easy-on-the-ears tracks. Most importantly, it's INTELLIGENT. This is the one CD I can actually use the wordS \\"SMART\\" and \\"GROOVY!\\" on.    If you like easy listening, jazz, real sentiment (not that mushy manufactured stuff), and streetwise romance, get this. You'll love it, swear.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|This is by far the best live concert DVD I've listened to! I'm a hard rock/heavy metal fan and I thoughly enjoyed this one.  Every cut was done to perfection, and these guys are pushing 60!  I did not miss Don Felder or Randy Meisner for that matter.  Joe Walsh complements the group so well--he adds that hard rock sound to the Eagles and I like this addition.  The song he sings \\"One Day at a Time\\" (about his troubles breaking free of drugs and alcohol) rocks!  I also like the other musicians in the background---they made the DVD sound great.  My only regret was that you couldn't use it as a CD.
1400044162|5.0|In 1967, a significant portion of southern Nigeria declared independence as the nation of Biafra. An ugly civil war (what other kind is there?) ensued, ending with Biafra's defeat. Adichie recreates the feeling of that period as she follows three fictional characters on the Biafran side of the conflict: Ugwu, a little boy who works for a Nigerian mathematics professor; Olanna, the professor's partner; and Richard, an Englishman and aspiring writer whose partner is Olanna's twin sister. From these three viewpoints, we follow this family from soon after independence to the end of the war.    Although Adichie makes no claim that she is recounting history (in her author's note, she writes, \\"I have taken many liberties for the purposes of fiction; my purpose is to portray my own imaginative truths and not the facts of the war\\"), the book really feels authentic, like it captures the hope, the passion, and then the exasperation and disillusionment that evolved in the course of the war. I was left sobered. Upon finishing, I reached to pick up another book and had to put it down, needing time to process Adichie's powerful illustration of her father's adage: agha ajoka (Igbo for \\"war is very ugly\\").    The characters are well developed and the plot is engaging; I couldn't put the book down. There is some war violence (although for a truly graphic portrayal of African war violence, read Alexandra Fuller's [[ASIN:0143035010 Scribbling the Cat]]), but mostly the book describes the war experience for those not on the front lines. [For those concerned about this kind of content, there is also some language and some sex scenes (portrayed, says the Guardian, with \\"a rare emotional truth\\").]    The professional reviews have been very favorable. The San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"profoundly humanistic.\\" The Guardian says that Adichie brings to the history of this war \\"a lucid intelligence and compassion, and a heartfelt plea for memory.\\" They are correct: Read this book.    [The San Francisco Chronicle review is from Martin Rubin, \\"The birth and death of an African nation,\\" September 5, 2006. The Guardian review is from Maya Jaggi, \\"The Master and his Houseboy,\\" August 19, 2006.]
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Disregard all the one star reviews from those who either could not play the discs or those who inadvertantly purchased this set in high-definition without owning a high-definition player and television. None have anything to do with the series itself. I have a Toshiba HD XA2 player that plays with no problem and this series is amazing. You will see scenes of plant and animal life that you have never seen, in crystal clear images. If you are not amazed by this series take the set down to an electronics supplier and ask them to try it on their HD set-up. Then up-grade. This set is worth it.
0954510364|5.0|Unfairly dismissed as a writer who wrote simple adventure stories, the popularity and longevity of Stevenson's novels have allowed them to join the literary greats, the most famous of which is \\"Treasure Island\\" (followed closely by [[ASIN:0812504488 Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll And Mr. Hyde (Tor Classics)]] and [[ASIN:0439295785 Kidnapped (Scholastic Classics)]]). To say that it is a classic is an understatement, as everyone knows of the one-legged pirate Silver, the dreaded black spot, the buried treasure on the mysterious island, the stretched-out skeleton that points the way, and of course that infamous scene of young Hawkins overhearing the pirates from within the apple barrel. Yet, as is often the way with classics, everyone knows certain aspects of it, though comparatively few people have read the book itself. Instead, most are introduced to the story through movie adaptations (and there have been a few, from the memorable Disney classic [[ASIN:B000089G5L Treasure Island]] to the definitive 1930s [[ASIN:B000GRUQLA Treasure Island]], to the inexplicable sci-fi version [[ASIN:B00005JLR2 Treasure Planet]]. Heck, even the Muppets got in on the act with [[ASIN:B000ATQYTC Muppet Treasure Island - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition]]).<br /><br />So, here's your chance to read the original work as penned by an excellent storyteller. Told in first-person narrative by the young Jim Hawkins, we learn of an old buccaneer at the Admiral Benbow Inn, a man named Billy Bones who leaves Jim in possession of a treasure map. It doesn't take Jim long to release that he's not the only one after this map, and together with figures like Doctor Livesey, Squire Trelawney and Captain Smollet, he sets sail upon the Hispaniola as cabin boy to the mysterious Treasure Island. Hawkins makes particular friends with the ship's cook, Long John Silver, a cheerful and quick-witted sailor who is surprising nimble despite having only one leg. But as the ship nears closer to its destination, Hawkins becomes aware of rumblings of mutiny amongst the crew - to kill the officers and snatch the treasure for themselves.<br /><br />Once they reach the island, the plot really kicks into high gear, as Jim is torn between the officers and the pirates, and the race to the treasure begins. On three separate occasions Hawkins acts recklessly, and yet each time his actions take a serendipitous turn and result in favorable outcomes. As such, \\"Treasure Island\\" is just as much a coming-of-age story as an adventure tale for young Jim, as he learns to take care of himself, take the initiative, learn not to judge by appearances, and separate friends from enemies. This is especially true of Long John Silver, easily the novel's most fascinating character. Devious, untrustworthy, charismatic, intelligent and able to switch sides at the blink of an eye, you never really know what to make of Silver, save that you cannot help but admire him. Despite all his double-crosses, he seems legitimately fond of Jim, and even Stevenson himself can't bring himself to send Silver to the gallows. In fact, Stevenson had originally titled the manuscript \\"The Sea-Cook\\" before this was vetoed by his publishers, shedding light on the importance of Silver within the context of the novel.<br /><br />Although it has entirely British cast, \\"Treasure Island\\" has an American dimension to it, perhaps owing to Stevenson's years in California - whatever the reason, it's hard to shake the feeling that the story has been \\"adopted\\" by American culture. Likewise, despite the fact that there is only one female character in the entire novel (Jim's feisty mother), it would be wrong to think it's exclusively for boys. There are plenty of thrills to be had for readers of both genders, and because it is a surprisingly slim volume written in action-filled prose, there's no reason not to think children of a reasonably young age can read it themselves. This edition in particularly is noteworthy, beautifully bound and illustrated - though any unabridged manuscript is more than enough.abridged manuscript is more than enough.
055358202X|5.0|I put off reading this book after I had purchased it because of some of the negative reviews and I would just like to encourage anyone who has enjoyed this series to pour through book 4 as you would the others because there is nothing not to like about this one.  While reading this book I felt like I got the chance to get to know some of the characters better.  The plot moves forward consistently with the other series.  Once again, whoever foo-fooed the book in their own estimation should really go back and read the series again and try to remember why they enjoyed Mr. Martin's wonderful work in the first place.  I cannot praise this book enough.  I especially liked getting to know the Stark sisters better.  Please buy this one with confidence.  An excellent read!!!
014240165X|4.0|After a friend recommended the Alex Rider books, and the movie adaptation pricked my interest, I settled down with \\"Stormbreaker\\", the first of what is (currently) a six-book series. Alex is a fourteen year old English schoolboy who wakes early one morning to find that Ian Rider, his uncle and guardian since his parents' deaths, has been killed in a car accident. It's not long before the truth emerges: Ian wasn't a banker at all, but a high-ranking spy for MI6 who was killed in the line of duty. Now Alex himself has been asked to fill his uncle's shoes, as a lifetime of mountain-climbing, foreign languages, martial arts training and other unusual activities suddenly becomes clear to the young teen.<br /><br />Ian had been undercover as a security guard at Sayle Enterprises, the company of a Lebanese businessman named Herod Sayle who plans to ship out thousands of cutting-edge computers to schools all around Britain. It sounds like the gift of a great philanthropist, but MI6 are suspicious and Ian's death only confirms their fears. Where does Alex fit into all this? The first prize in a Sayle-run competition is for a young girl or boy to be the first to try out the new Stormbreaker computer, and MI6 want Alex to take the place of the *real* competition winner in order for him to do some snooping. Alex has no choice - if he doesn't comply, the government will deport his beloved housekeeper Jack Starbright back to the United States.<br /><br />So undercover he goes, armed with some clever gadgets (a zit cream that melts through metal, a yo-yo with a nylon string and a rather extraordinary game boy) in order to investigate the strange individual that is Herod Sayle (who comes complete with dangerous pets, larger-than-life henchmen, and a tragic back-story of his own).<br /><br />When attention turned from boy-wizards to spy-kids after the success of Robert Rodriguez's movie [[ASIN:B00003CXWJ Spy Kids]], the market was suddenly flooded with demands for high-tech, fast-paced, savvy young spies, as seen with the likes of Kim Possible, Agent Cody Banks, the X's and so on. The story may not even be remotely plausible, but Anthony Horowitz has successfully jumped onto the spy-kids bandwagon and run wild with it. Alex is a smart, likeable kid and the plot so breathlessly fast-paced that any discrepancies in the story are effortlessly glossed over. The villains are villainous, the evil plot is nefarious, and the henchmen have names like Nadia Vole and Mr Grin (thanks to a knife-throwing accident at the circus, he sports a scar that pulls his face into a perpetual smile) - what more can you want? With practically every chapter ending on a cliff-hanger, this is a perfect book to try out on a reluctant reader.<br /><br />If there is one thing that bothered me slightly, it's that Alex is a little too good to be true. I brought the martial arts and the physicality of the teenager, but when Alex bests Sayle in a snooker game or spouts a reel of computer jargon to Mr Blunt, my suspension of disbelief was stretched somewhat. Oh come on, I hear you say - in a story filled with giant jellyfish, submarines and teenage espionage, what's the big deal? In my opinion, it's fine - no, *necessary* - that in a book like this there are wild plot turns, but it needs to be balanced with a grounded, realistic protagonist that the reader can relate to. Alex makes too few mistakes during the course of the story (there are a few slips of the tongue, but nothing too serious) and at times displays superhuman skills, all of which distance him a little from the average reader. Looking at our culture's typical heroes, our favourites always seem to be the ones that slip up now and then, chastise themselves, have physical limits: Indiana Jones, John McClain, Batman - we like our heroes dark, fallible, and *human*. Am I expecting too much from a story that's meant to be pure entertainment? Probably, but it's also true that we never really get inside Alex's head, particularly as to his relationships with (what we suppose) are the two most important people in his life - Jack and Ian, and as such, he remains a little distant. However, this may change in future books, as it does seem that Horowitz is laying down seeds that will come to fruition in later books - I expect to see a lot more from Jack Starbright, Mrs Jones and Yassen Gregorovich (the Russian assassin that killed Ian Rider) in future books.<br /><br />Other than that, I have little to complain about. The \\"Alex Rider\\" series is all set to be a great reading experience, and [[ASIN:0142406120 Point Blank (Alex Rider Adventures)]] is next on my reading list.with (what we suppose) are the two most important people in his life - Jack and Ian, and as such, he remains a little distant.

0553582461|5.0|WOW.....I have not read an author in a long while that just grabs you and gets you involved with the story line and the ones in it.  After finishing the 9th book(the three connected series), I almost felt a little worn out, but very happy with the way it ends.  My heart almost breaks with the way the Fool goes off into the sunset with out knowing what happens to the one whom he has shared so much.  Anyway, will have to reread the who thing again one day.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|My December definitely shows growth and depth in an artist. The album is a book - the songs, chapters.  Clarkson's writing is so intimate that I feel guilty - as though I am peeking in to a diary left out on the coffee table.      I love the gentle sounds of \\"Sober\\" and \\"Be Still\\", the fun ride of \\"How I Feel\\", the hard vibes of \\"Hole\\" and \\"Never Again\\" and the endearing exposure braved in \\"Irvine\\".    Despite all of the attention surrounding the release of this CD, it is apparent that Clarkson chose her path and rightfully so.  The journey is one of raw personal honesty and substance - not of manufactured experience and empty calories.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|The friendship of three remarkable people is central to this beautiful, fast-paced film about Beatrix Potter. Potter published The Tale of Peter Rabbit--the first of many children's books that she wrote and illustrated--in 1902. She was 36. The film pulls this period of the Brit's life (she's played by Renee Zellweger) into appealing close-up. Mostly, it does so by showing her dynamic, fateful friendship with publisher Norman Warne (Ewan McGregor) and Warne's sister Millie (Emily Watson). The three are intelligent, educated, adventurous, and eccentric. Better yet, they're each other's equals.    The film's greatest moment occurs when Potter and the two Warnes, along with the Warnes' quick-witted mother, sit outside at a table during the afternoon and have a conversation. They are candid but careful, free-spirited but self-aware. In this delicately-played scene, we see the grown-up tête-à-tête of a million childhood freaks, weirdos, and oddballs (maybe you know them, maybe you've been them). Their exquisite dress and daring but careful dialogue, combined with the green of the environment, make the scene almost ethereal.        At the film's heart is the capacity for fancy and wildness. This is obvious in the sleek animated sequences that pop in and out of the narrative. These sequences show Potter's independent-minded characters in action. They fluidly interact with her (Potter seemed to believe that they had a kind of real existence). They are like doppelgangers of Potter and the two Warnes, and must, like the film's three main characters,  face the consequences of their actions, balancing responsibility and desire.     Miss Potter is a delight throughout. Those who know nothing about Potter's life beforehand will be especially intrigued by unusual plot developments--there aren't a lot of clichés here. Performances are vivacious, especially Watson's, whose eyes sparkle as she zestfully expresses avant-garde philosophies. Zellweger confirms that she is at her best in British-themed material (not that anyone who's seen the Bridget Jones films would doubt it), and Ewan McGregor is a pleasure to watch as the timid-but-determined Norman Warne. Other highlights: the costumes by John Bright and Anthony Powell, and Andrew Dunn's photography (several Lake District are especially memorable).    One of my few complaints is that Potter's relationship with her mother is, for being such a pointed aspect of the story, almost completely unexplained. More insight into this tricky relationship would have been helpful. What is certain, however, is that her friendship with Norman and Millie helped her to face her mother with greater strength, and to become more self-sufficient.    Minus its mother/daughter narrative flaws, Miss Potter is a strong, charming film. It leaves us wanting more--in a very happy way.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|When lead-singer Michael Way called the album \\"psychotic\\", he wasn't kidding. Upon my first go-round with The Black Parade, I didn't get it. I sat there for a moment thinking, \\"Wait, what?\\" However, having listened to \\"Three Cheers....\\" and \\"I Brought You...\\", I knew better than to go with first impressions, so I listened to it again....and again....and again...and I'm still listening to it almost a year after it's release.     What a superb Junior effort by this group of alt-rockers (if that's the genre you choose to place them in).  This album has a little something for everyone. I enjoy this albgum so much, I would love to write a review for each song on the album.  However, that would prolong you from doing what you should be doing, which is listening to the album.  Stop reading and start listening.    One listen and you'll hear influences ranging from Green Day to Pink Floyd to Queen. All superbly brought together with the brilliant musicianship of My Chemical Romance. If you're even remotely interested in My Chemical Romance, buy this album. And, even if you're not interested, buy it anyway.  WOW!!!
B00004SU5J|5.0|Thanks to Amazon, I was able to buy a CD I had been hunting for several years, and at a great price including postage to Australia !  The tital track Rose Rouge is an edgy Jazz/Rock ensemble without peer, and is definitely a 10 out of 10. The other numbers I rate between 7 and 9 and the CD has not left my car CD player in nearly 2 weeks I love it that much !  Thank you Amazon and your seller for giving me the chance to buy this all time great modern jazz item ! Any Jazz lover should invest in this album for you would not be sorry ! :-)
B000HWZ61Y|4.0|Was an absolutle blockbuster back when it was released, and interestingly enough, it still holds up pretty well.  Of course it is fairly dated 80's rock, but they managed to put together a good enough album to last the test of time.  Till now, at least.
1400063515|5.0|As much as I enjoyed this book, I could have stopped after digesting the summary contained on the inside leaf of its jacket.<br /><br />Don't take my lead the wrong way.  I ordered The Black Swan the evening I received an e-mail announcement of its soon-to-be publication.  It may have taken me a little longer to read it than my fellow reviewers, but I was not going to miss it.<br /><br />Taleb's first book, [[ASIN:0812975219 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]] articulated fleeting thoughts harbored by me for years.<br /><br />1. Random events are unpredictable.<br />2. They arrive with a massive impact.<br />3. Immediately afterwards a rational explanation can be concocted.<br /><br />Who could have active in the markets as long as I without experiencing an evening trip home perusing real estate ads for a castle in the South of France only to wake the next morning and experience a meat cleaver appearing from the middle of nowhere and removing half of your face.<br /><br />My mistake, I now recognize, was in expecting Euclidean precision in a book about randomness.  It will never happen.  Sure, I scrutinized the end notes, pondered the bibliography selectively adding books and journal articles for my Umberto Eco Memorial Library.<br /><br />I loved the book.  I am sure Taleb benefited greatly from articulating and expressing the thoughts contained in it.  If you seek a narrative on randomness, save your time and money.  Like his previous book, reading this will change the way you perceive events.  You will find yourself with a new appreciation for life's outliers.

B000E8NQU4|5.0|The Moody Blues were a rock and roll band who expanded its range. However they have become one-dimensional without the songwriting of Mike Pinder, Ray Thomas and Graham Edge. Ride My See-Saw, House of Four Door, Legend Of A Mind all of this variety made the Moody Blues a Dynamic group. Not that Justin Hayward did not have a strong part to play in the sound, with strong songs. But it is something definitely missing in the new sound of the Moody Blues
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is vintage Maiden at their ferocious best - could this be their best album since Seventh Son??? Effortless and flowing melodies, aggressive staccato power riffs, tight harmonic guitar interplay, fiery yet intelligent solos, key changes, rapid-fire passages, epic story-telling  and a progressive attitude make this album a joy to listen to. These guys are no hacks, once again they prove to be talented musicians and songwriters who ply their trade with skill and taste. I absolutely love the minor-major key switches on Montsegur and Gates Of Tomorrow. There are several anthems to add to the Maiden canon but I won't list them all here, and there isn't any filler - all songs are excellent. The keyboards are a nice touch and are tastefully used in some places to create a rich symphonic sound. Finally, the cover artwork is quite impressive and is certainly the best one to date - the inner cover and the CD label image fit the concept nicely. Maiden fans or classic/progressive metal fans - don't hesitate to get this great album. Metallica-style metal fans might not enjoy it as much...
0743437497|5.0|Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.<br /><br />Your \\"helpful\\" vote is greatly appreciated.

I try for the hook that will make a person want to read this book.<br /><br />A man and his family move into a Colorado hotel in the winter. The man is the caretaker of the empty hotel, and soon weird things begin to happen. King's description of the topiary (sculpted shrubs) is wonderful.

B000002IWH|5.0|Not simply gothy, or \\"emo\\" or whatever the kids are calling it today.  Of course, the movie was a goth-kids fantasy, but I believe the sound track is more than that.  There's a lot of depth here, quite an eclectic mix.
B000005YZM|5.0|Generally I find that the critics \\"lost classics\\" were lost for a good reason. This album is one case where they got it right. This album should have been a huge hit - it's a crime that it got such little play back in the day. I can't guarantee that you'll like it as much as I do, but I can guarantee that it's top quality vocal pop/rock from the time when the music scene was exploding. Stir up the Beatles, Beach Boys, and Kinks and get a totally original treat.
B0000062Y2|5.0|The first time I heard the music was watching the movie when it first came out. I was on a submarine transiting from Faslane, Scotland to Halifax, Nova Scotia for a liberty rest after a Northern Atlantic patrol.  We (the crew) almost wore the sprockets off the 16mm version copy. The music has always hummed in my memory, and many times I have found myself humming or whistling the refrain. Now with todays technology I really can get it going.
B00011RPB0|5.0|This is one of my favorite flicks. The more I watched it, the more I liked it.  The first time I viewed it I was almost indifferent but once you get it I can't stop watching it. Very well done...music score is so very different but awesome....you'll see.
0753820250|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought Ruiz Zafon did an excellent job of describing people, places, and events in a manner that brought them to life, but without drowning the reader in too much text.  The imagery was subtle but complete.  I felt like I was watching a movie in my mind's eye... I could see the Aldaya mansion, the Hospice of Santa Lucia, Clara's apartment.  I could see Nuria's flat and watch her care for Julian.  It is easy to connect with the characters and truly feel their emotions.  I felt like Daniel with his copy of Carax's Shadow of the Wind; I could barely put it down.  This book will surely get a re-read this summer.  Hope someone translates another of Ruiz Zafon's works into English.
B000GIXLO8|3.0|No new material?  Just release a new box every now and then.  That's basically what this \\"new\\" set seems like to me.  I can't picture any serious collector not having the extended editions already on DVD, and/or waiting for the HD version.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Every Wilco album is a new road and Sky Blue Sky is no exception.  They have moved from the Broken 60's Pop of Summerteeth to the Mysterious Noise of YHF to the Quiet Reflection of Ghost.  All personal favorites of mine.  Now they bring us the Melodic Guitar Driven Sky Blue Sky.  I have been playing it since getting it a few months ago.  If I am to judge simply by the number of times played in the first month after purchase, this album is equal to YHF and just ahead of Summerteeth for me (Ghost took awhile to click for me, as did Being There.  I still don't love A.M.).  The usual Wilco changes in rhythm mid-song, obscure lyrics side by side with straight lyrics, and country-folk roots are all present.  The album has more melodic lead guitar (courtesy Nels Cline), fewer experimental sounds, and Tweedy's voice very forward in the mix.  I usually don't skip a song on the album, but stand-outs for me are: \\"You are my Face\\", \\"Either Way\\", \\"What Light\\", \\"Impossible Germany\\", \\"Leave me (Like You Found Me)\\" and \\"On and On\\".  That was the best I could do in picking just a few!  So put this down as a rave review.  If you are new to Wilco this is a good place to start. But wherever you start with Wilco, you have to know they are never the same the next album you get.

The story was pretty cool as well with the connection between the dragon and rider. This movie made me want to read the books. I have seen one star movies, and I am telling you, this is not one of them. It is absolutly not fair to rate this movie one star. If you want a one star movie, check out Zombie Nation. LOL
B00007AJF9|4.0|Elizabeth is a beautifully shot film directed by Shekhar Kapur.  The cast was a whose who of future stars and past cinema giants.  The cast includes Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Kelly MacDonald, Daniel Craig, Vincent Cassel, Emily Mortimer, Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Joseph Fiennes and of course Cate Blanchett.  It is screen legend John Gielgud's final picture before his death at the age of 96 and he gets to play the Pope.  English pop singer Lily Allen also appears in a small role when she was just 12 years old.  The film portrays the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England.  She is the bastard child of King Henry VIII and Anne Bolyn, and was queen for 45 years starting in 1558 and until her death.  The period she ruled was often regarded as the most significant period of growth in England's past.  Her legacy is a positive one and she is often recognized as the most highly regarded British monarch in history.<br /><br />The film follows how Elizabeth became queen after Mary I of England's death.  It deals with many issues regarding the fact that she is Protestant and was imprisoned for allegations that she planned to assassinate Queen Mary I.  She is released when Mary I dies and Elizabeth becomes queen.  Many conspire against her, from Catholics to the Scots and the French.  It also follows Elizabeth's love affair with Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes).  The film ends fittingly with Elizabeth's reign entering stability just before the beginning of the English Renaissance.  I say fittingly because a sequel to Elizabeth is being released this fall and it will no doubt exhibit the true nature of Elizabeth's legacy and the reverence held toward her to this day.  It covers a more interesting period in my opinion.<br /><br />I actually had a problem with the concept of this film.  The nature of this period in Elizabeth's life didn't sit well with me in terms of transferring to a motion picture.  The way liberties are taken with historical facts inject drama effectively and actually makes up for what should've been a fairly anti-climactic story.  So her life becomes a bit of soap opera.  Part of me thinks that if the film was pure history it still could've been good but perhaps not has marketable.  I found it enjoyable either way.  The sets and costumes are incredible and the cinematography is also worth praising.  The real strength in Elizabeth is Cate Blanchett.  She is the best actress of this generation and is amazing here.  This may not seem like a timely review (it's about eight years overdue) but with the sequel coming out I recommend seeing Elizabeth.  The sequel has Samantha Morton as Elizabeth's antagonist Mary, Queen of Scots and Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh.  No doubt its release for the fall is setting it up for some major awards.rama effectively and actually makes up for what should've been a fairly anti-climactic story.

B0002IQNAG|3.0|I am a huge fan. I like zombie movies of all types. I like Dead Alive. I like 28 days later. I like this version of Dawn of the Dead. But I really didn't find it steller. FOr one, the film is very dated, making it hard for us to take the zombies seriously. But that's alright. I understand it is 30 years old. What I don't tolerate is Romeros social satire. It might be because everybody talks about it, but it seems about as subtle as a zombie in a strip club. We get already. Zombies want to come to the mall. Zombies are mindless. Humans are like zombies. That means... wait for it... We are a mindless consumerist culture. Wow. Thanks for the insight. In spite of this the film is interesting and well made. It just seems like Geore sacrificed the brooding, oppresive tone for a more comical one. I understand that bad stuff goes on and there is some great, shocking gore, but, overall, it just seems like people give the move a bit too much credit. I personaly prefer the remake.

One of the most viewed reviews (by Kory) explains the difference between regular widescreen and anamorphic widescreen and how annoying is to watch the 1977 film with black bars surrounding the whole picture (top, bottom, left and right).<br /><br />Could Lucasfilm have released something better than this? Definitely. This limited edition of the star wars trilogy is the same from 2004, the difference now is that one of the \\"bonus materials\\" (what is that supposed to mean?) is the original release, no digital Jabba, Han shooting first, Ewoks singing at the end of `Jedi' and the original phantom of Anakin Skywalker. It took only 2 years for this release after Lucas stated he would not be releasing the original versions. Now he releases this and says he will not remaster them, which can only mean we have to wait another couple years to have the original versions remastered.<br /><br />I agree with those that believe Lucas disrespected his original films, for a company that is the one to set the quality standard in movie releases (ILM and THX) this is a poorly done job, Dolby 2.0 surround, not remastered and non anamorphic! They did a superb job remastering the special editions, try watching the special edition and then compare it to this DVD release, the difference is abysmal, I tried to watch this in my widescreen TV and had to use the zoom feature as it is not enhanced for anamorphic widescreen which only made the quality of the image look worse.<br /><br />Why did I purchase these then? Well, I, like many fans, still kept VHS copies of the original trilogy before the special edition, the VHS image was not anamorphic, not remastered and the format is almost extinct. I see this release as a digital version of those VHS films, I believe this DVD will last longer than my old VHS copies and plus, I got them at the price of $9.99 each (and can be found cheaper) I can finally get rid of the old VHS and keep these digital versions of the original films.<br /><br />It is rumored that a complete collection is to be released later this year commemorating the 30th anniversary, it will probably have the original editions remastered, however, I do not intend to purchase that, enough is enough, I had always waited to see a DVD release of the original trilogy, well, it may not be the best but it is finally here. Over the years I've learned that Lucas will always have `never before seen' additional material to include in every single new release he plans. I have the special edition (remastered as it is) and these limited original versions copied from the laser disc release.<br /><br />I decided to buy it and stop complaining, finally, this is the last Star Wars trilogy I am buying!ersions of the original films.

1904920233|5.0|I've never done Japanese cooking before, but with this book I can.  I have made four recipies from this book, and they have all turned out spectacularly well -- the sort of thing I thought was only available in a Japanese restaurant.  Some of them have needed special ingredients, which is easy for me because I live in NY where there are Japanese groceries, but some need nothing more exotic than soy sauce.  Terrific book: I hope they write more.

B00008GKEG|5.0|Filled with amazing footage, this is the definite collection for Beatle fans everywhere.  More than just nostalgia, this is music history very well choreographed.  Each DVD is filled with interviews, concert performances and personal insights. It is great to relive this time and place once again.  Also amazing is to realize just how much influence the Beatles really created then and even now. The DVD's do a great job in re-creating that era's zeitgeist(spirit of the age).<br /><br />Just some things to note.  This is not an album DVD. So if you're looking to buy a music DVD expect to be disappointed.  The late John Lennon is voiced and videoed in from early recordings.  His views and opinions  can naturally only go so far.  Imagine what it would have been like to have John, Paul, George and Ringo sitting around the table reminiscing about the good-old-days or even one last jam session.<br /><br />Wonderful collection filled with great memories.
1596590688|2.0|I must say that there were some interesting observations conveyed throughout the book, but the 'Game Show Host Voice' of the reader, the many mispronunciations, and the shear repetition of only vaguely interesting business examples from 100 years ago leads me to giving this book a low score.
B0002OOUP0|5.0|The bset cuts from, arguably, the best years of the Stones. If you are Stones fan you probably have most of these on other albums, however now they are all together for you, just pop in the cd and you've got eighteen of their best. A shame, however some longer versions of the songs aren't here, like Waiting on a friend...the long version has some incredible sax solos by Billy Keys. The one downfall of strictly studio cut albums.  Forget the iPod, just play the entire CD!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This item currently has 5 out of 5 stars as its average rating. That should be enough to its credit for even the most hesitant buyer. As someone who has looked at the Supernatural franchise for quite a while, never daring to dip my foot into the water until finally purchasing the complete season DVD, let me tell you that buying this is not something you will regret.<br /><br />On the most base, surface level, the series is a road trip across the continental US by brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, each episode a stop in their journey, and essentially what a self-contained take on an \\"awesomely good yet horrible horror movie.\\" (I mean that phrase in the most loving way possible.) What makes Supernatural so much more interesting is that there is so much going on underneath the surface. (That statement may have a scarier tone to you after you watch episode three, \\"Dead in the Water.\\") The mythology inherent to Supernatural's treatment of the \\"Things that Go Bump,\\" as well as the back stories of the Winchester boys, keeps the viewer engaged at all times.<br /><br />Buy this! Wait until darkness has fallen, then turn off the lights, (lock up all the doors if it'll make you feel more secure), and fire up the DVD player. It won't be the most terrifying thing you've ever seen, but the broad spectrum of topics covered in the various episodes means that your oldest fear from childhood campfire tales will surely come back into your living room.
055358894X|3.0|WOW!  By reading all of these fabulous reviews I would have thought this was better than A Song of Ice and Fire by George Martin!  Sorry, not even close.  I certainly liked R. Scott Bakker's \\"The Prince of Nothing\\" better.  I like Greg Keyes \\"The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone\\" better.  I like Paul Kemp's Erevis Cale series better.  Finally, I am reading Acacia by David Anthony Durham and it's better.      Maybe I am just not too huge a fan of an \\"Oliver Twist\\" tale.  Still, it was good enough for me to continue the series.  I am just in disbelief by how many \\"glowing\\" reviews this book has recieved.

B0009VRHLK|1.0|Read the story description, it says it all. You see a bit of motorcycle racing at the beginning, the rest of the movie is pretty much shot through the mostly dirty windshield of the main characters van as he drives cross country. He has some dialogue with the parents of his ex girl friend who are taking care of her brown bunny, this lasts about three minutes, there's another two minutes of dialogue with a prositute in Vegas and about the same with a small town waitress, he crashes at a budget hotel in LA, leaves a note for his ex who shows up and they too have about two minutes of dialogue, then she gives him around five minutes of oral sex and the credits roll. Strange movie, I obviously didn't quite get the director's  point.  Great movie to have on in the background while you are reading a book.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I bought the book and movie at the same time, deciding to read the book first and then watch the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and toward the end could not resist the urge to watch the movie.    It was the biggest let down. I totally expected it to be shortened here or there and knew it would not be as brilliant as the book itself, but I did not expect it would be as horrible as it was.    The movie moved along at an incredibly fast rate not only skipping many events, but changing the story a bit here and there. The movie is very choppy, the person who rewrote it for the movie script, the producer, director and editor should not be allowed to work in the film industry anymore until they have gone back to school.    The acting was spotty, but not completely horrendous, considering the movie was being produced in such an amateaurish way. If I had written this book, I'd have made sure to have my say in the way it was made. There are too many pieces left out and changed that kill the story, and underplay the brilliance of the novel. I hope they did not already get a contract to do the next book of this trilogy. I, for one, will not waste a penny on it.     My recommendation, skip this movie. Read the book instead, it is superb (not quite Tolkien quality, but good) and is time well spent.
B0009YGL1E|5.0|im not going to go into discussion of this film since you either have seen it or havent, and if you infact havent seen it, its better to see it yourself. I never been one to take others opinons on films but take my own opinon as the basis for rating a film since most people have poor taste in films and rather see what is a summer blockbuster film that has cgi and a high budget then see a film that has a plot or quality performances from the actors, with that said...    This dvd version of 1492 is incredible, it has a crisp Anamorphic Widescreen viewing with a good audio channels for sound and even has a nice bit of Extras that include trailers, interviews with actors and director Ridley Scott. This Film itself is 156 minutes long so the fact they squeezed so much on a dvd is pretty sweet instead of splitting it on a double sided dvd or something else which would have been irritating... So this is a single sided dvd which is convient... Also take note that this is a Region 4 dvd from Australia, so that means you need a region free dvd player or to set your Computer's dvd player to the region 4 format... anyways hope this helps you decide incase you were inquisitve about this title... its a great movie, entertaining and very violent, but done tastefully for a pg-13 movie but makes for a good movie to watch to get a idea of how the america's were discovered...

0156030322|5.0|James Sallis's novel, \\"Drive,\\" is as sharp and concise as haiku written with an icepick.  In every way, \\"Drive\\" is as good as \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice.\\"  As soon as I finished it, I was looking forward to reading it again. For readers who drop everything when the new George Pelecanos or James Crumley comes out, start reading James Sallis today.  \\"Drive\\" is a great place to start.
1854875744|5.0|I first read this book (or the three paperbacks) when I was 14, and have re-read it a number of times throughout the intervening years. Every time, I come out the other side a changed man. I think a fully open mind (\\"gullible in the right way\\") could do worse than start the process toward \\"illumiantion\\" by reading this book.<br /><br />Folks who really love this should check out [[ASIN:0671816691 Cosmic Trigger: The Final Secret of the Illuminati]], which is Wilson's non-fiction account of what happened after the book. It's a trip.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I had not even heard of this pic when it was announced on Oscar night. I strolled, not ran, over to the local theater to catch it. Boy, was I surprised! This movie is among the best I've seen in years. What an atmospheric, intense, highly stimulating work. What is so great is that it does not have that Hollywood-entertainment feeling that now dominates. Instead, like \\"The Man Who Came in From The Cold\\" or \\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" it feels like the world, like life itself, not something designed to make you feel good, but like a philosophical essay designed to make you think. It is in fact entertaining, if by that one thinks of  something gripping and exciting. It is not at all boring, but it is not action-packed; there is no sex or senseless violence. The film is set in Eastern Germany under Communism and like so many films from former-Communist Russia, the film is an ethical exploration of artistic freedom, loyalty, and ambition. It is a superbly sensitive story and, most importantly the film does not celebrate grand causes. It is a quiet, dignified film and celebrates people for whom action has enormous consequences.
0375703764|5.0|(I swear I already wrote a review for this. The Minotaur must have eaten it.)<br /><br />This book will disappoint you if you're looking for a coherent tale. It will disappoint you if you read it because your friends say it's the best novel ever. A good friend of mine hated it until she decided to regard it as \\"interactive sculpture\\" -- I cannot say I am entirely sure what that means.<br /><br />All that said, I was in no way disappointed. I find this one of those novels that seems to have a psychedelic effect just from the reading of it. I was changed by the time I was done. It was a book that required that I do some of the work, too. No spoonfeeding of tales here.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:0440539811 The Illuminatus!

Who knows where this trend will end?
B000N3T0DW|4.0|If you love this director as I do, you can't give this a five (5) unless you are prepared to give his better films sixes, sevens or eights. Of course, it is always wonderful to see anything by Almodovar, clearly one of the most fascinating film makers in the world. Anything by him beats hands down 99% of the dreck produced, but still: is this his best? There are numerous great scenes, yes. I missed the artistic coherence and the thrilling sexuality of his earlier films. This film was perhaps too feminine for me, too domestic perhaps, too filled with tears and memories for my taste. But, hey, that's what films are. They are for everybody, but they are personal experiences. At the same time, much of the movie is fantastic and emotionally deep. I especially loved the scenes with the deceased mother hiding under the bed, a ghost with an agenda, with a perverse desire to tease and taunt. Lots of fun. Ms Cruz is gorgeous and playful and sexy, reminding one of Sophia Loren at her best. Yes, this movie has a lot going for it. Still, I think this marvelous director does well when working with men and women. After all, you need two sticks to make a fire.
B00005JL2O|3.0|i think there will never be an unfunny or boring Austin Powers. the writers are good. but I'm the kind of person that usually only likes the first movie. the first austin powers was the best! liz hurley was beautiful in it, and the fembots. i didn't like the 2nd one b/c Heather Graham did not look attractive, and it seemed the dullest of all 3. i wanted to watch this b/c i'm a fan of Beyonce and think she is beautiful. unfortunately it is she that brings the movie down. austin powers is suppposed to be about 2 elements: Austin and his essential accompanying humor and the hot babe who supports him. i feel that Beyonce was not a good supporting actress. she is not a good actress in this and thus weakens the movie. she seems artificial and overacts. she is not natural; like she knows the camera is on her and this is a movie e.t.c. maybe she needed time to practice more and maybe it wasn't the right movie for her b/c in Dreamgirls she was awesome; her acting was really good and believable in that. i think she needed time b/c i do think they essentially chose her for this movie b/c of her star power and the fanbase she'd bring. but at least she does look hot in it! but i did like the ending of it. i think she wasn't so bad at the end. my verdict is that this is still watchable and shows off hot beyonce. Yeah baby!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|The reviews posted here tell about a brilliant satire that explores and reveals great subjects, grand topics, and enormous themes. I believed every one of the reviews, which are brilliant in themselves, but I didn't find the movie at all the kind of film that informs and enlightens. I loved the comedy, the acting, the wild story line, the goofy antics and odd displays of maladjustment, but I didn't get the feeling that great truths were being explored. The grandfather character was played so well by Alan Arkin that I began immediately to say the big \\"O\\" word, Oscar. His every gesture and expression is the work of a master comic actor. About half way into the movie, I got tired, though, and after the grandfather dies, I lost interest in the film altogether. Frankly, I didn't like them very much and only cared about the old man. The silent son was interesting until he opened his mouth, and then he seemed very ordinary. The parents were awful, the road trip became terribly long, and the arrival scene in LA seemed suddenly too goofy, as they drove over the flower-beds and through gate posts, I really wondered where the police were and figured, as a life-long LA resident, that they would have been shot after 10 minutes of that kind of craziness. So, yes to the acting, and yes to Arkin, and yes to the idea, but I'm happy not to have to see any of those awful people again.

B000NVIGC0|3.0|This is one of my absolute fave bands--This is disappointing for me even after 5 or 6 run throughs..Tweedy whines on and on about love lost on virtually every song...the most sophomoric he has ever sounded, with ocassional nice little lyrical parts (not as clever or as important as previous three records--I mean he sings about doing laundry for Christs sake, c'mon man) and some guitar parts which he relies too heavily on..it remainds me of Beck's Sea Change which he came back from thankfully and Neil Young's Tonights the Night (although Neil relied a lot on Lofgren's guitar, at least the angst was not a handcuffing factor for every track). Some good stuff on here, but get over the broken heart thing on every track man. Not nearly as pretty as previous \\"girl\\" tracks.. I look forward more inspired things from Tweedyco next time.

B0002B15XI|5.0|Robert Altman the great director of M.A.S.H gives an interesting perspective in a 1977 interview with Roger Ebert in the book Awake in the Dark.  He said \\"the problem is that people insist on getting everything straight.  On having movies make sense, and on being provided with a key for unlocking complex movies.  \\"It's the weirdest thing.  We're willing to accept anything, absolutely anything, in real life.  But we demand order from our fantasies\\".    That is so true because at first watching the movie and having been in the military i was like there is no way they could punch a higher ranking officer, sexually harass anyone let alone a superior, have mustaches and haircuts like that and wear the clothes they wear and i wasn't one of the uptight guys in the military by any means.  Then about halfway through i thought to myself I'm finding it hard to accept a haircut and a mustache that's in a movie, yet i could watch the bloodiest war film and not question it or for that matter watch war any night of the week for real on the news.    When you think about it what should be harder to accept?  Maybe we shouldn't accept just anything in real life and have it be our fantasies that run wild.  Speaking of fantasy, i was done writing this review hours ago and i got this idea.  M.A.S.H could've been in the minds of me, my friends, or other guys in the military during all the hurry up and waiting.  The movie could be two guys that are in this unit who talk and have conversations about \\"oh i'd like to do this or i'd like to punch that guy\\" and we could be seeing their imaginations and their conversations played out for us.    The fact that I'm still analyzing it shows how great a director Altman was  and what a good movie can do.  I can't wait to see more Altman films.
0316067598|5.0|Kids, boys and girls, young men and young women... somehow growing up in a rural or semi-rural area gives them a heads up on life.  They know about birth and death as well as how fast it can happen.    They learn about decisions that must be made in a split second.  I don't know Marcus personally but I do know several of his friends as well as the man who helped him prepare for the Seals Training.  They all have a very strong belief system.    His book, like his life, is for living and paying respect where respect is due.    I belive in the military as I am retired from the USAF.  I believe in the men and women of the US Military.    This book is not for wimps, nor is it for liberals.  It was written by a young man who comes from the backbone of America.  Without him and others like him we would not be what we are today.

B0001US8EO|4.0|This film has received mixed reviews, mostly focused upon differing opinions on Costner's portrayal of Wyatt Earp. Some say that Costner is too stoic and unemotional, while others comments that, well, that's the way Earp really was. Both miss the point.    The crux of Costner's performance is that he anchors the film. As a producer, he helped give this motion picture artistic direction, and as an actor, he is the keystone of the production. Granted, Dennis Quaid is tremendous as Doc Holliday. Still, Costner's stage presense in the film give it a great deal of its depth. This is one of Costner's best performances, due largely to his success in portraying Wyatt Earp as a man who was motivated and governed by his own internal code, rather than the hardships that continually confronted him.    (Beware: Plot Spoilers ahead!) We follow Wyatt Earp from his boyhood days learning life's lessons from his lawyer father, here protrayed by Gene Hackman. We see Earp enduring the death of his first wife Verilla from Typhoid (watch for the mom from \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" portraying Verilla's mother). Earp falls into despair, attempting to drown his sorrows in alcohol. He descends into a criminal existence, only to be incarcerated as a horse thief. He is rescued by his father and journeys west, where he, almost by accident, is drawn into the life of a lawman in Dodge City.     What is most compeling about Costner's portrayal of Wyatt Earp is how his character evolves through his confrontations with outlaws. He begins the film as an idealistic, adventurous young man who is at heart a romantic. The tragedy of his first wife's death, coupled with his continual confrontations with ruthless outlaws, causes a profound shift from youthful exuberance to cold, tough survivalism. Earp depends on the enforcement of the law, because in the old west that's all there was to depend upon. Costner successfully portrays Earp's abandonment of his youthful ideals as his reputation as a lawman grows.    It is not until Earp finds love again that his inner self appears to be reawakened; this is portrayed in a believeable, if not overly emotional fashion.    As aforementioned, it is Costner's stage presense that gives this film its anchor. He presents Earp as a man whose sense of identity was stronger than the wickedness and lawlessness of his countrymen, and it was this quality that gave Earp what he needed to survive and triumph over the criminals that hounded him continually. To the film's credit, this facet of Earp's character is not presently overtly, but rather very successfully inferred by Costner's intense portrayal of one of the Old West's most controversial and misunderstood figures.    I strongly recommend this film, particularly to Costner fans. Just about anyone with an interest in the Old West might find merit in this film, so give it a shot (no pun intended). You'll be glad you did.     Note: Watch for Tea Leoni's \\"cameo\\" as a prostitute attempting to seduce Wyatt during his formative years in the west. Remember her from \\"The Family Man\\" with Nick Cage? She's almost unrecognizeable here.
1567315682|3.0|Though this book seems to be a research over several years of, most of its findings didn't appear earth shattering to me. Stanley essentially keeps emphasising on low-consumption lifestyle, and how consumption is inversely propotional to building wealth - this doesn't really shock me, but I think , the author has a different audience in mind for this book - that which spends a lot to try to derive satisfaction out of their lives.    As a matter of fact, I disagree with the author's contention that most people living in rich neighborhoods are not affluent (his conclusion is based on the fact that they are forced to spend too much to keep up with their neighbors).     I would have liked the author to address some emotional issues aroung spending money. For e.g., he says the typical millionaire lives in a modest neighborhood, is probably not as highly educated as his children eventually end up being etc. Well, the quality of children's education/ upbringing is directly related to the quality of the neighborhood - which forces people to buy expensive homes. And once one starts to live in an expensive neighborhood, one gets sucked into a higher consumption lifestyle because of one's need to be seen at par with the rest (as well as one's children not feeling inferior to other kids).    Of course, if one cuts out the emotional element out of one's spending habits, and can live in a 1200 sqft home in a not so good part of town, anybody really can become a millionaire.

B000060OFT|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all-time. The modern setting makes it possible for the everyday person to understand and relate to this classic Shakespeare play.

This movie is great, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good movie to watch. (Except the end is so sad!)

0316067598|5.0|Right before I bought this book, I heard all the promotional \\"buzz\\" and \\"word of mouth\\" associated with it. When I started reading it, after the first 60-70 pages, which were kind of boring, I was saying to myself, \\"woe, were they really talking about this book, it's kind of boring!\\" Then we got to Navy Seal training. Ladies and Gentlemen, (Future readers.) I recommend you fasten your seat belts, fasten your chest harness, and it probably is good advice, to put a pillow behind your neck to protect you from whiplash! This story, then rockets non-stop for the next 320 pages. I'm a U.S. Veteran, and I thought my basic training was pretty tough. But after reading this book, I realize, I probably wasn't in basic training, I was on some kind of holiday, and instead of cussing out my drill instructor every night, I should have been sending him candy and flowers. Basic Seal training is tough, but they're just getting warmed up with some basics, such as: \\"they just bound our ankles together and then bound our wrists together behind our backs and shoved us into the deep end (Of the pool). This caused a certain amount of panic, but our instructions were clear: Take a huge gulp of air and drop to the bottom of the pool in the standing position. Hold it there for at least a minute, bob up for new air, then drop back down for another minute, or more if you could.\\" All along the way, the instructors are declaring that most of the potential Seals won't be here at graduation, they'll either be thrown out, or quit. (Note: Only 30 of the original 180 made it!) A number of these highly motivated seamen dropped out during basic Seal training, and now.. And now... we get to \\"HELL WEEK\\"! I will attempt to briefly summarize \\"Hell Week\\" for you. What these cream of the crop, young American men, are put through, is hard to fathom. It is past inhumane. I'm surprised some politically correct ACLU representative isn't present, suing the Navy, but this is the only way to train the \\"best of the best\\"! And it's this training, that probably saved Marcus's life, in his ordeal in Afghanistan. 0500. \\"Give me 20 pushups! Go run into the freezing ocean in combat boots and fatigues. Get out of the ocean and roll around in the sand. (This will be referred to from here on out as getting \\"wet and sandy\\"!) Give me 20 more pushups. Now go on a multi-mile run down the beach, in soft or wet sand, with a million sand particles in your combat boots, and stuck in every crevice of your body, thereby acting like the most abrasive sand paper you'll ever have administered to your body. Oh you want to eat breakfast, well jump back in the freezing ocean, get out of the ocean, roll around in the sand (Getting \\"wet and sandy\\") run the couple of miles back (all in an accepted maximum time, or you're out of the Seals!) Give me 20 pushups! Now you can eat. Now pickup a log the size of a telephone pole. Run into the same aforementioned ocean (While still carrying the log!) Come out of the ocean. Get \\"wet and sandy\\". Give me 20 pushups. Do it again. Now pick up a boat and run down the beach. Put the boat in the water, turn it over and fill it with water, bring it back to shore. Get \\"wet and sandy\\"! Give me 20 pushups. Now get in the boat with your teammates and row backwards through the waves. Then turn around and paddle backwards through the waves. Hit the beach and get \\"wet and sandy\\"! Now I'll fast forward to diving drills in the pool. Wearing full diving gear, with heavy air tanks, jump in the pool, but your feet cannot touch bottom. If they touch bottom you're out of the Seals! To keep you company under water, there are friendly Seal instructors, pulling your masks off, pushing down on your back, and other assorted friendly, efforts to assist you in drowning. But here's my favorite from this exercise. An instructor will rip your air hose off and tie it in a knot. You have to reach over your back, since you can't see the hose, and try to untie the knot without drowning. If you can'tmake it, you're kicked out of the Seals. There are so many more tortuous tasks, that literally go beyond human endurance. These young men, are dedicated, and committed to the United States of America, and go where people don't want to go, and do what must be done! My favorite quote from this book, that will live with me forever, was by the infamous instructor Reno, during training: \\"THE BODY CAN TAKE DAMN NEAR ANYTHING. IT'S THE MIND THAT NEEDS TRAINING!\\" I could go on and on, about this book, and I haven't even gotten to the indescribable battle for \\"Murphy's Ridge\\". Even though, to some people, the battle, and the deaths of Marcus's teammates, and Marcus's survival, is probably the most discussed part of this book. I will never forget, the dedication, desire, guts, pride, and total, (And I mean total!) commitment, and their stretching the envelope of human endurance, by these amazing young American's! As a U.S. veteran, I salute, and remain in unending awe, of these unique, gifted, dedicated, American heroes! \\"God Bless America!\\"make it, you're kicked out of the Seals.

0060512806|3.0|Fact is, it is too damn long and takes forever to get to the point.  When you are still wondering where the book is going after 500 pages, there is a problem.    It doesn't help that the WWII story is far more interesting than the \\"modern\\" story, especially when the modern story hasn't aged all that well.  He should have focused on one or the other.    That being said, there is a lot of good stuff in there.  I wish it all came together better than it did.

B000F8O35U|5.0|The Little Mermaid is such a beautiful a classic disney story. I have always loved it. The characters are great, and the music is wonderful. Not to mention it is a wonderful story.
B000NA28I4|5.0|I was expecting to sit through this movie, but not to really enjoy it. Kind of pointless really, to watch a film and expect not to be entertained. However, much to my joy I really, really enjoyed it.<br /><br />So don't trust in all the critisms or bad press, put aside all expectations of realism and accept that you will be swept into a fantasy film and just enjoy.<br /><br />I would def. watch this for a second time!
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|The awkward, unattractive scream at the beginning of Dimension sums up the quality of this CD.   There may be a few good moments on the disc, but I agree with the dissenting reviews in that this album does injustice to many well-respected, pioneering acts and is not up to par with other music in this genre.     If Mother gets stuck in your head, buy that song from iTunes and resist the temptation to buy the whole album.
0385340559|1.0|One row of a large bookcase in my library WAS filled with Lee Child books. I have every one and have enjoyed them. But Bad Luck and Trouble was a very disturbing book. Reacher has been a wandering hero in many of the earlier novels. Not so, in this one. He has become a cold-blooded murderer just as evil as the prey he stalks. I find little redeeming qualities in this book and have relegated the Lee Child books in my collection to the garage sale box. P.s. I like Alaska Airlines. You might want to actually read some of those scriptures, Mr Child. I hope the Jack Reacher we knew before, can return.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|The 25th anniversary HP 12C Platinum is definitely faster than its predecessor. Good user manual, geeks will find it hard to put the unit down. The HP 12C has its strengths, particularly in chain calculations and one button percentage functions - % plus or minus, %change, %total, markup , margin as well as G.P. calculations. Once you learn RPN and how the HP stack handles numbers, you'll leave your colleagues in the dust with most everyday figuring. Comprehensive financial functions are fast, but don't lose the book. Even so, I'm hooked on this \\"retro\\" calculator.
1400064627|5.0|Read the book, it's better than the movie and you will be glad you did.
0393317552|3.0|This is great writing, and Diamond is an engaging author. The content, however, sometimes lacks reason and support from others in the field. Brings to light some things that many people don't know, though, so it's still recommended reading.
1582701709|3.0|This book is about positive thought and focusing on the good things you want out of life. There is no secret or magic in the book, but it is nice to read motivating passages.  However, I did picture myself winning at a casino on my vacation and sure enough I won. So maybe there is a little truth to it.
B000O174CM|4.0|I deliberately waited until all the hype was done, all the awards were won, and until I was no longer tired of Beyonce to purchase and view Dreamgirls.<br /><br />It is indeed an excellent presentation.<br /><br />Directed by the director of Chicago, another fantastic musical (and that's saying a LOT as I am generally NOT into musicals) Dreamgirls brings to the screen the excellent Broadway production of the 80s that put Jennifer Holiday on the map.<br /><br />Apart from top-notch production standards, wonderful costumes, fantastic music, and excellent performances all around, Dreamgirls is indeed another wonderful presentation of a slice of African-American life/culture that is worthy of any movie collection.<br /><br />All performances were equally riveting.  Of course we all recognize this as a thinly veiled retelling of the Motown/Supremes story.  (Its a shame Florence did not have the happy ending Effie did, but such is life.)<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson's Oscar was indeed well-deserved.  She was simply powerful though not necessarily a sympathetic character for the most part.  To Beyonce's credit, she did not AT ALL try to be the focus and her performance was rightfully understated.  Eddie Murphy was indeed wonderful as a composite of Little Richard, James Brown, Wilson Pickett, etc.  Jamie Foxx was most competent and I am so glad he got a chance to sing a few songs - though not a sympathetic character at all, he is still a consumate actor and a major contributor to making this work on film.<br /><br />I can certainly understand the standing ovations it got in some theatres and friends of mine who went to see it in a theatre attested to that.<br /><br />It really should have been at least nominated for Best Picture but, alas, again, the nature of the beast!! (Remember \\"The Color Purple\\"?!!)<br /><br />Nothwithstanding, this is wonderful entertainment and I highly recommend it.
0316166685|3.0|After hearing so much about this book, I decided to read it. The writing was good, the characters were decent, but I couldn't get past the fact that the book involved a gruesome murder. I usually read books to escape from the world. This book is just too real, so I guess the writer did a good job. I was just really sad and depressed as I read the book.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|DO NOT BELIEVE THE KC BACKLASH/ BACKSTABBING- Like Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" or Patti Smith's\\" Radio Ethiopia\\" - MY DECEMBER is KC's true BREAK AWAY    this is the only KC CD I own or have considered actually purchasing    true creative inspiration comes from within- not a bank of pap staff writers. please Mr. Davis- Loosen up !!!
B000F3AAUW|4.0|The first time I heard the album, I listened to it all the way through.  I thought it was just OK.  \\"Who Cares\\" was sort of clever.  And how on earth did \\"Crazy\\" get to be such a hit?  But I listened to it again a week later, and I found a little more to like.  A few days later I wanted to hear those two songs again.  Now I can't stop listening to them, and, yes, I agree that \\"Crazy\\" is amazing, and I love it.  The songs on this album have richly layered beats that you find something new in each time you hear them.  Cool, baby!
0792846443|4.0|Everytime I watch *Misery* I find that I still cannot stand to watch the scene where Anne Wilkes (Bates) hammers Paul Sheldon's (Caan) feet to keep him from escaping.  Yes, I know that's the best part of the entire movie but I still cannot look at it.  I have to turn away.<br /><br />Paul Sheldon is a writer who has written many books with a character named Misery.  However, Paul has grown weary with Misery and has decided to kill her off in the last book of the series.  After completing the manuscript, Paul veers off a shoulder in a blizzard while on his way to see his editor.  As luck would have it, his number one fan, Anne, former and disgraced nurse, discovers the crash and rescues him.  However, not only does she rescues him but she also holds him hostage.<br /><br />Anne cannot stand the idea that there is an end to Misery.  So, Paul is ordered to redo the entire book to Anne's liking.  For the entire winter, Paul rewrites his book but also plans his escape.<br /><br />*Misery* remains to be a classic as it is still a good nail-biter of a film.  It can be a little long for some people but it is worth it all.  I still think this is the best of Kathy Bates.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The songs that are funny are VERY funny, and the songs that are sad are very sad.  It opens with \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\", a song that in any other show would be the closing number (in other words, start off with a climax and build from there.).  For my money the three best songs are the ironic \\"The Wizard and I\\" (the W.W.'s wishes for the future), \\"What is This Feeling\\" (the best song in the show, it uses the clichés of a love song to talk about W.W. and Glinda's mutual loathing.  If you hum any tune for a week it will be this - unless it's . . .), and \\"Popular\\" (Glinda's witty I-Know-How-To-Make-You-Over romp).  The much-praised \\"Defying Gravity\\" is ok, but really just your standard Broadway Empowerment Tune(tm) -- this generation's \\"Impossible Dream\\" from MAN OF LA MANCHA.  Likewise \\"Dancing Through Life\\" has such a great tune that it was a shame to waste it on those silly lyrics.  They should have reprised it later in the show for a different character with deeper lyrics.  Still, cast album is going into heavy rotation on my CD player.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|It doesn't surprise me at all that this album is as incredible as it is.  Musically, it is a masterpiece (and I'll be damned if the instrumental mid-section of The Dark Eternal Night isn't some of the most insane stuff ever layed down...Much respect to simply being able to remember the sequence of all the meter changes!!)  I would say it is their best, but everytime they put out a new album I say that, so it's their best until their next best one is released.  Dream Theater continue to impress fans and fellow musicians and deserve all the success and growth they have achieved over the past 20 years.  I've been a fan since '92 and I've never been disappointed.    If you are new to Dream Theater's music, this album is a great \\"throw you to the wolves\\" introduction.   Great album...a definite must own!!

B000LC51TM|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. If you don't want all the interviews and extras in the Volkerball sets that cost big bucks, buy this package. One concert DVD and one audio CD for a very fair price in a great fold-out package. This is the essential good stuff. The dvd has over 100 minutes of concert footage!!! The dvd is compatible with Region 1 US machines. The CD is full-length (75 minutes)and live. Wow! P.S. This great little set is selling for a lot more than this on ebay.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|As a Rush fan, I love this album. The only album I honestly do not care for is Test for Echo, which just doesn't do it for me. Compared to Vapor trails, the sound mix is FAR superior...and I LOVE about 1/2 the songs on this album...especially the 2 instrumentals. The other 1/2 are honestly okay for Rush standards. My rating of 3 is based upon comparing it to their other albums. Going back in time, the progression from 2112 to Signals is UNREAL!! If these albums are 5's, then I have to give Snakes&Arrows a 3, which is totally fine...I still love the new with the old. Honestly, playing 3 hours a night in their mid-50's is a 10 in my book :)
B00005JPLW|2.0|In short, this is a comic book turned into a movie with video game aesthetics, telling the tale of the 300 Spartans who died fighting back parts of the Persian army at Thermopylae in 480 BCE. The very   fact that the introduction rather cheerfully depicts the eugenic conditions of Spartan adolescence, and that the almost two hours of film are filled to the brim with (some, historically accurate) lines mirroring Spartan warrior ethics, could make this movie into a nice sliproad from a seemingly endless stream of movies focusing on the quite tiresome theme of modern individualism.     But that's only on the surface. In one scene, the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) lectures on the importance of the army keeping together, using their shields to protect each other, and  consequently creating a strong unity. In combat, this unity is initially kept, but then each Spartan runs along towards his own one-on-one battle, showing off a few hokum stunts. Interestingly, this is quite a precise parable for what makes this movie collapse: there is nothing keeping it together. This makes the movie, at its heart, into the very opposite of what it is set out to be. The exterior of an over-blown praise of an interpretation of Spartan life, accompanied by mediocre acting, blue screen animations, Hollywood sound effects, NuMetal riffs, billions of slow-motions, and the constant use of the increasingly obscure concept of \\"freedom,\\" will most probably entertain some people. But beneath all this, there is nothing.     Those who seek art that beautifully portrays heroism, will not find it here.    Not even the debate on whether the movie draws its motivations from current politics or not is very interesting. Instead, what makes this work sort of fascinating as a phenomenon, and meaningful to review at all, is that it's an excellent example of the extreme contrast between modern and traditional thinking, and of surface versus content. These filmmakers take some ingredients from the past, but don't know how to deal with them other than by throwing them into a stew of modern decorations and purposes. While awful as a movie, and hardly worthy of ancient Sparta, at least \\"300\\" stands as an unintentionally comical monument of contemporary misunderstandings.
B0000696I0|5.0|As a kid watching this I was totally in love and seeing it again brought back some great memories. Its a wonderful story and also I found it be one of my personal favorite action/adventures. Go Ninja Go!
0316067598|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, the cover looked interesting and I've always been interested in real life stories. This book turned out to be very well written. I believe Patrick Robinson helped somewhat, but the author does a fantastic job of describing what is was like training to be a navy seal. This book shows what is really takes to be a special operations soldier and how really brave and intelligent these folks are. I would highly recommend this book.
1400079276|4.0|Between shifting plot lines and interesting characters, I found this book very entertaining. I didn't give it a 5-star rating simply because the ending left me feeling a little out of touch. While I know this is common for Murakami novels (from the 6 or so that I have read), I still found the message behind the ending a little opaque and it left me feeling a tad empty (or perhaps that was the point in the first place). Aside from the ending, I really liked the book as a whole and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Murakami's strange stories and unique delivery.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|I bought this new version of \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" to get a studio-version of the legendary unreleased song \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\". Obviously the strongest part of the song is, what was released on the original album as \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\", and the track is what it says, \\"a work in progress\\". Still interesting moments. The other takes of \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" which are included as bonus-tracks have made me realize how good a song this really is.<br /><br />What surprised me the most when I listened through the album was that I thought it sounded different. Was it really that long since I last heard it? I did not realize that the album had been both remastered and remixed. I guess it will take some time to get used to these new \\"versions\\" - but the sound is really crisp and clear, and if I want to hear the old mixes I can always return to the originals.<br /><br />The original album contains some the Doors' most poetic and melodic moments like \\"Yes, The River Knows\\", the exquisite \\"Love Street\\" , which is one of the highlights of the album. The moving \\"Summer`s Almost Gone\\". \\"Wintertime Love\\" and \\"Spanish Caravan\\" are other highlights.<br /><br />\\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" and \\"Five to One\\" : Classic Doors !!!<br />The hit singles \\"Hello I Love You\\" and \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" may not have aged as well as the rest of the album`s songs. Except of course the weak \\"My Wild Love\\" which probably always will annoy me.
B000MGVCFO|4.0|in the 1960's and early 1970's the moody blues were in a league of there own for inspired, inticate and creative popular music. This album continued the high standard of there earlier albums. This album in SACD is superb and the standard of production is stunning and lends itself brilliantly  to this remastering technology. It sounds as if the band is present and performing in front of you.
0743289684|5.0|This book was insightful and interesting.  I learned a lot about the cultures in Somali, Saudi Arabia, and Holland.  Aayan is truly an inspiring woman.  I could not put this memoir down.  I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about the culture in Africa and the Middle East or who just wants to read an inspiring story.
B00005JPLW|4.0|This movie is classic gladiator and deserves more than one viewing to capture it's genuis. Yes, this movie is not for the weak stomach,sqeamish,or narrow minded. I've enjoyed the movie's special effects and fight scenes. No movie is like this movie so that makes it a good release for movie lovers to see something different, soo gritty and barbaric at the same time. This movie has alot of macho to satisfy a helpless man in need of a ego. There's chaotic battles and some violent images you will find guilty entertaining. So, be brave as the SPARTA'S and see 300 with a open mind, then you either can become one of the two viewers which is those who \\"get it\\" or those who don't. Take this film unique style for what it's worth.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  The ladies in Celtic Woman are energetic and talented.  The songs were lovely and the production excellent.  We recently saw them in person in Portsmouth, Virginia, and that compounded our enjoyment.  Seeing them in person was every bit as memorable as the DVD.  5-star entertainment.
1416914285|4.0|I actually thought this book was a great first novel.  The characters are interesting and it's a great teen read.  It really kind of reminds me of Neil Gaiman with fantasy set in reality.  She did a great job and I think the trilogy will be awesome!
0151012768|5.0|This is told on the form of emails, letters and reports and interviews. DR Alfred Jones is a fisheries scientist who is asked by a yemeni sheihk to do a seemingly impossible task of introducing salmon to the river Wadi in Yemen. The climate's too warm for salmon and initially DR Jones refuses. But after some pressure from his boss, who is in turn under pressure from the sheihk's agents and even the british government, he gives it a go. Along the way we read of his relationship with his wife and a budding relationship between him and Harriet (the sheihk's agent's rep.). It's very funny, especially when DR Jones gets involved with the government, and is rather impersonal as it's all told via the emails and letters and diary entries. These diary entries simply end up in the form of first person prose. The humour is very subtle rather than laugh-out-loud funny. But it seems very original. The ending is a little dark, sad,- not sure if , overall, the book suited this ending. But a great read.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is a powerful revelation of Christs last moments on earth. A must see for any believer in his word. I actually recommend it to those who are not believers. It is something we all should know about to understand what he did for us all.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Before I get into some random, slightly sarcastic, comments - directed at no one in particular and certainly meaning no disrespect to those mentioned - let me say I loved this film. But, I think it's meant for those who appreciate a good Jane Austen book or film - where people think and feel, as opposed to act. Very little seems to happen on the surface, while deeply held feelings bubble underneath.    This film seems very true-to-life, and only reiterates the irony of the events of 'that week' more than I felt at the time. The ultimate irony - which I felt at the time and now more so - is that Diana would have HATED the royal family pulling her back into their fold as much as they hated doing it. She loved her celebrity, without a doubt, and enjoyed the way she overshadowed the 'Establishment.' But I don't think she meant to ever become a part of it again - regardless of the fact that she was the mother of the future king (William). It occurred to me at the time that she would have hated her ex-husband going to France to claim her remains and bring them back to England. Even though her sisters were with Charles, in retrospect, perhaps her brother should have done it.    Some random thoughts:    1) Now we know the answer to the long-standing question 'What DOES she carry in that purse?'. The answer is --- a pen (to update the speech she is eventually talked into making about Diana).    2) What does the Queen use to touch up her nose after a cry? Her Hermes scarf, at least while she's alone in the Scottish countryside after her Land Rover breaks down.    3) Try as I may, I really never 'got' the subplot about the stag. What was it meant to symbolize? The stalking and subsequent death of Diana, the possible extinction of the monarchy...?    4) I was very surprised at the level of anti-monarchy feelings, had no idea Cherie Blair was so blatant.     All the parts are well-cast, especially Helen Mirren; her ability to get inside the skin of Elizabeth II was a wonder. Shedefinitely deserved the Oscar for this performance. I appreciated the sensitivity with which the film dealt with Princes William and Harry, but was a bit surprised at the generous portrayal of Prince Charles and the almost-venomous way Prince Philip was portrayed. All in all, I think the film gives a sympathetic view to the Queen's (and the monarchy's) feelings about the death of Diana.
B0000013G9|5.0|Awesome record. Sad that Left Eye is no longer with us. This Trio had it all, looks, sound and ability.
1417634391|1.0|The minute I read the first paragraph of James Frey's \\"memoir,\\" A Million Little Pieces, I thought, \\"This guy is full of s**t.\\" The entire book reads like a pathetic B-movie full of sterotypical characters written in such a cliche, repetitive, amateur style that it could well have been conceived by the overly active imagination of a 12 year old. But that should come as no surprise since Frey spent years trying to become a reknowned Hollywood screenwriter. Frey's curious proclivity to capitalize random nouns comes across as ostentatious and self-indulgent rather than innovative. His choppy, stream-of-consciousness writing style is painful to try to get through.    As if the prose itself is not bad enough, we have the dubious content of the \\"memoir\\" with which to contend. Isn't it amazing how someone, who claims to be severely addicted to every drug ever produced and to black out on a daily basis, can recall with painstaking detail--ten years after the fact--everything from his airplane flight covered in vomit, piss, and blood, to the excruciating details of detox even as he drifts in and out of consciousness. James Frey can remember the color and texture of his vomit, but he can't tell the intake worker at the rehab center how much alcohol or drugs he consumes on any given day? How curious. Anyone who actually believes this is a legitimate account of addiction knows nothing about the subject. How this garbage could inspire any addict defies credulity. In fact, Frey's book is a slap in the face to the brave men and women who fight the disease of addiction every day.    Frey's account of his addiction is so full of self-aggrandizing egoism that it is difficult to take any aspect of his story seriously. In his opening depiction of his trip home, Frey claims he has no idea where he is going or how he got into the condition he is in. But one has to wonder...Who on earth would put a man in Frey's condition on an airplane unattended in the first place?     There are so manyother implausible revelations in this book--the rescue of Lilly from the crack house is particularly absurd--one can only conclude that Mr. Frey did not embellish the details of his sordid life, he out and out fabricated them. I would be surprised if even 10% of this account is legitimate.
B000002KMV|5.0|All that needs to be said here is it's classic Prince. What more do you need?
0140544518|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite picture books.  I have read it and used it as a teacher with children from grades K-3 as well as with my own children.  Reading the story always sparks great debate as to whom children believe--the wolf's account or the pig's, and children of all ages can see the humor in this account of the wolf's version of the story of the 3 Little Pigs.  I couldn't get through a school year without reading The True Story of the Three Little Pigs.
B00005JPD0|5.0|This is a very cool movie. Great concept and it kinda makes u wonder.. I love Denzels films.
B000002B1M|5.0|Yes, Illmatic was a classic debut, but It Was Written was a very impressive follow-up. This album seems to get lossed in conversations about great albums. Nas's flow was as deadly as ever and the album had great production. It Was Written brought Nas more into the public eye. Illmatic was a street classic. After this album, I think Nas tried too hard to appeal to mainstream and it caused a couple half albums.    From beginning to end, It Was Written is a great listen. Nas is one of best poets to ever touch a mic, hands down. His lyrics give you visuals and his thoughts are way deeper than the average rapper. If you want to listen to lyrics that make you think and are creative, It Was Written is classic album to buy......

B000PKG4SC|5.0|Welsh/Nigerian songstress, Dame Shirley Bassey, returns with an album of classics with a contemporary twist. Produced by a slew of cutting edge producers and remixers like Bugz in the attic, and North by northwest, the project was driven by the Dame herself.<br /><br />Best known by some for the Bond theme songs she sang; \\"Diamonds are forever\\", \\"Goldfinger\\". And \\"Moonraker\\", the 13 songs on this collection are heavily influenced by that. The album has already given Dame Shirley Bassey her first UK top 10 album in some decades and deservedly so.<br /><br />\\"The living tree\\" is arguably the best Bond record that never was, with it's Trip Hop feel; a brooding sound, sweeping dramatic strings and explosive vocal delivery (her voice is as booming as ever - she doesn't do things by halves) from the seventy year old Dame. Similar is the self assertive \\"This is my life\\".<br /><br />Lionel Richie's \\"Hello\\" is given a haunting, atmospheric treatment. Nicole's dad would be proud of the result. The lightly horn sprinkled \\"Can I touch you there\\" (the Michael Bolton song) is similarly transformed (lovely percussion and nice male harmonies).<br /><br />\\"I who have nothing\\" is given a slight dub feel, while \\"I will survive\\" is transformed by epic sounding strings and skittery percussion. \\"What now my love\\" has a slight salsa feel. \\"You only live twice\\" (originally done by Nancy Sinatra) is covered superbly here, downplaying the Bond feel, and giving it a light Cuban feel.<br /><br />\\"Where is the love\\" is given the disco treatment (superb sax outro, by the way), similar to her \\"Moonraker\\" hit, and her old hit \\"Big spender\\" starts off startingly like Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" in its new incarnation.<br /><br />The title track is a rousing reworking of Pink's \\"Get the party started\\" with dramatic strings, and crisp enunciation from the Dame.<br /><br />It is amazing to see a veteran like Dame Shirley Bassey still sounding cutting edge and not resting on her laurels. If you like your music bland and safe, this might not be for you.<br /><br />Her other album of remixes, \\"Diamonds are forever: the remix album\\" is also worth checking out. \\"Get the party started\\" is a wonderful aural experience!!Her other album of remixes, \\"Diamonds are forever: the remix album\\" is also worth checking out. \\"Get the party started\\" is a wonderful aural experience!!

1594489505|3.0|I thought the book was good and if I could have rated 1/2 stars, I would have given it a 3 1/2. It was a fast read but not nearly as dynamic as \\"The Kite Runner\\".

0596007124|5.0|This is the best design patterns book i have ever read.  With a completely new approach this book makes learning design patterns such an enjoyable reading experience with lot of FUN. Having worked with Object Oriented programming in Java for many years i found myself enjoying the reading with every page and could see many aspects of design practically unfold in multitude of images in my mind as well as in the book. The examples are great, the bullet points are excellent and the pace and tone of the text alongwith the images and drawings are absolutely fantastic. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn and apply patterns in their object oriented programming using Java or C#.
B000PFUAO6|2.0|Being a long time fan, and after not really liking Octavarium very much, I wasn't sure what to expect.  After the first couple of minutes I thought this album would be reaaly cool.  After that they lost me.  The songs just didn't grab me.  Don't get me wrong, there is nobody better when it comes to musicianship, but the songs just aren't that good.  Here and there I would here something really cool and after a couple of bars it was gone, never to be heard again.  Hope I like the next offering.  I used to just buy Dream Theater albums because I knew they would be great.  After the last two I will be listening to the samples first.
1582701709|2.0|Many (All?)of the people featured in the film/book have made a fortune by selling ideas, not merchandise. They tell people how to get rich and they get rich themselves. Is this THE secret? \\"THEIR\\" secret.     You do not have to feel guilty about your fellow citizens living in a dumpster when you are living in a mansion either, because they wish it upon themselves anyway! Here is \\"the secret\\" of a self-made millionaire discovered in a scientific study(cited by Joe Vitale as well, for more info. on this search \\"scrully blotnick\\" on google):\\"Usually the wealthy individual is a businessman who has lived in the same town for all of his adult life. This person owns a small factory, a chain of stores, or a service company. He has married once and remains married. He lives next door to people with a fraction of his wealth.\\" Can you guess where the money comes from?    I have read the book, seen all the videos on youtube, and I have not heard anybody say they have done anything good for others (esp for the poor 95 per cent of the world population) other than telling them to go home and make their own fantasies come true hollywood style.     This is a big fat distortion of all the good ideas they have stolen from ancient masters.

B0000085N4|5.0|I love this album. It takes me back to a time when Rock gods still walked the earth.    Though all the songs are worth listening to, \\"Edie\\" is my favorite.  I can almost see the woman the song is being sung too. Melancholy, you bet.  Though I've officially played it enough times now to drive my wife batty and had to remove the CD from the player, the song is still capable of producing tears.    If you like bands that effectively produced that \\"wall of sound\\" experience, you'll like this album.

B00006GFAB|4.0|This KISS compilation is a good record, but not a great one.  KISS was a big band in the mid-70s thru early 80s, and this CD gives a good overview of their stuff.  Something that keeps this album back is that a lot of the songs, especially in the first half of the disc, sound so much alike, almost just like variants of one song.  The good tunes amount to solid rock.  Here they are:    Strutter  Detroit Rock City  Calling Dr. Love  Hard Luck Woman - an actual sensitive, acoustic tune from KISS  Christine 16   New York Groove   I Was Made for Lovin You - great song, really moves, lyrics stick in head  Love it Loud - kinda cheesy lyrics, but tune is catchy  Lick it Up - ditto  Forever - ballad from 1990 that's pretty good coming from hard rockers    This album gets stronger toward the end, in large part due to more song variation
B000PWQPAC|5.0|The plot-heavy story is back for one last, amazing story that pits us right in the middle of something terrible. Togusa is the new leader replacing the Major, after she decided to go off mysteriously. Batou is feeling estranged, and there are tons of new recruits for the infamous Section 9. A series of suicides leads Togusa and crew to the Puppeteer, an untracable entity with no motive at the time. The story gets quite more dramatic as problems seem to arise and stagger Section 9 to the point of having no leads for the Puppeteer problem. The story goes on forth like this and the last 40 minutes in probably the most intuitive and thought out since the first Ghost in the Shell movie came out. Although the first 2 movies and this have two varying storylines. This movie has felt like a true to life movie of Ghost in the Shell. All the voice actors have come back to give us the characters we have come to love. The animation is the same as the show was, although I call this a movie others could beg to differ and call it a long episode. All in all if you like Ghost in the Shell or anything that might have you guessing throughout an entire movie this is perfect for you.

Great story and great music    One Love - awesome tho simple, it's a call to unity    Redemption Song - slow with soft guitar, a stirring call to free your mind and free yourself, resist opression    Jammin- - a fun party tune, no message here but just to jam
B000E33VWW|5.0|\\"Capote\\" is a movie based on the life of Truman Capote and his personal journey in researching a story for his New Yorker magazine. It was during this period that Capote wrote his first non-fiction novel, bring about a new approach to the face of journalism. His non-fiction novel tells the story of two men, who broke into a quiet farm in the village of Holcomb in Kansas on Nov.15, 1959 with the intention of robbery but ended up killing a family of four. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the part of Capote and did a remarkable job of capturing all the distinct physical characteristics of Capote that made him a well-known public figure during his years of fame with his novella \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\\"   On January 1, 1960 the arrest of the two murderers, Perry Edward Smith and Richard Hickock came surfacing, and as smart, and manipulative as Capote is, finds a way to build a relationship with one of the men in particular and even found a new lawyer for the two men to have their conviction over turn from death by hanging to may be life imprisonment, he also gives them some kind of idea that the purpose of the book was basically in favor of them. To them, Capote was a reporter trying to help them but to Capote, he was doing a research for his book.   Capote starts the book without the knowledge of Perry and even titled the book \\"In Cold Blood\\". He continues to lie to Perry about not starting the book until one day, Perry finds out from the newspaper, about Capote's public reading of the unfinished book. When asked why he lied and why he chose that title, Capote quickly replied, \\"I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. The organizers of the book picked the title and my job was to amuse the crowd. How can I choose a title we still haven't talked about that night.\\" Perry quickly becomes convinced and realizes the events of that night have to be revealed for Capote to complete the book. The two men looses their appeal and with no hope left, Perry invites Capote backto his cell and gives him the detailed accounts of that night on Nov.15, 1959. Capote learns it was Perry who actually pulled the trigger and also learnt that their main intention on that night was to rob and not murder.   The movie ends when Capote takes his last trip to Kansas on April 14, 1965 to witness the hanging of his friend Perry Smith.   One aspect of the movie is that, it concentrates more on the strong relationship Capote built with one of the murderers and the effect it had on his life, making this book the last of his novellas.   There were implications of love story between Smith and Capote in the novel \\"In Cold Blood\\" but that side of the movie was not taking into details. This is okay because the book also showed other aspects like symbolism, which cannot be seen or read from the book.   One symbolism was the scene where a man came to Capote in the midst of his friends, gave him compliments on his works and disappeared just like that. Capote made a comment like \\"call back my father, referring that man as his father, easy to give compliments and quicker to disappear.   Dan Futterman and Bennett Miller did an astounding job of answering the question as to why the movies was titled Capote, because most of the screen time and camera is well spent on Hoffman who did an astonishing job of not only playing Capote but becoming Truman Capote.   The screen colors are dark in tone, which works well with the mood and settings of the movie as it is told in anticipation holding audiences to the end of their seats.   The screen play is well written and the movie is well directed making it a unique work of art.
B000002LND|5.0|This album has all the big hits and best stuff from Madonna from 84 thru 90.  Great compilation of the stuff from the first phase of Madonna's career.  Gotta have this if you're a fan of the 80s.
0060977493|4.0|What takes place in this story is gripping; however, I found it very difficult to read.  Many times I almost put it down and then the next chapter would totally capture my attention.  I am so glad that I did finish it.    The capitalization, sentence structure, Indian words, backward spelling, etc. just diverted my focus on the book rather than adding to it.  For some readers, this might help portray images, feelings, etc.  For me it was just confusing.   And would someone tell me what Ammu lost when she lost her \\"locusts stand I\\"???  This phrase occurs several times and I realize that is what the twins are hearing, but I just couldn't get it.  This is just typical of so many of the confusing elements.      I have read several wonderful novels set in India lately (Inheritance of Loss, for example), however, I felt that what some call Roy's extraordinary narration, I found to be just gimicky and distracting.
B0000025RI|5.0|There's a reason this album sold a bazillion copies.  It's really great dance/pop music from a guy who, despite his weirdness, was a really great entertainer and could sing.  This record is an established piece of early 80s culture; the songs on it are a reminder to a lot of us of our junior high days.  The songs here make you wanna dance.  A great album from the days when MJ was a superstar entertainer, not a circus freak for tabloid fodder.

B00005NP04|5.0|This is a great collection of Martina's stuff through 2001.  Martina has a powerhouse of a voice.  This album was a big part in my coming to accept country singers, instead of just rock or pop.  Here are just the best tunes:    My Baby Loves Me - great intro tune, a salute to unconditional love    Life #9 - another high energy hit.  Martina tells roaming man he is down to his last chance    Independence Day - stirring song about tragic effects of domestic violence    Safe in the Arms of Love    Wild Angels    Happy Girl - very fun and energetic song    Whatever You Say    Love's the Only House - social commentary by Martina    When God Fearing Women Get the Blues - a funny and energetic song about a straight-laced woman who just cuts loose one day    With 19 songs, most of them winners, this CD is a great buy for the fan and an excellent intro to Martina and modern female country for others.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|No matter who portrayed James Bond in past movies, he was always sexy, sophisticated, smooth, and fun, while deadly efficient.  Handsome, yes.  Able to take care of himself, yes.  Women liked him and men wanted to be him.  Sean Connery, the quintessential Bond, is difficult to match.  No, we don't expect anyone else to have the same appeal on screen, but we don't really want to lose sight of the original, either.    Daniel Craig was not the actor many people expected, and some were disappointed, all before the movie was released.  It seemed an interesting choice to me and I was curious about how he would come across.  I'm glad to say he wasn't bad.  Buff, oh my yes.  Ruggedly handsome, yes.  Even tender once.  But there was no sense of fun.  No rascal.  Mostly just deadly.      As for the screenplay -- well, too much of nearly everything.  The first action scene, which everyone always looks forward to, went on forever.  I actually went out of the room twice during it, and still got to see the end.  Other action scenes could have been shortened.  And the brutal scene where Bond is naked -- too much for me; I don't know how a man could stand watching it.  A half hour could have been cut easily overall, maybe more, making the story more immediate and more about the characters.  Younger movie goers might have thought the brutality was all right, but us older folks can do without it.  There are also a few times when something is missing in the story line, and the scene or sequence doesn't make sense.    Judi Dench as always was wonderful.  Mikkelson was not the campy villain we're used to, he's just plain psychotic.  Green is a believable, and lovely, love interest.  And the scenery takes one's breath away.  I'm not sorry I saw this movie.  Just a little sorry that the filmmakers seem to have lost sight of how much fun Bond can be.
0743299795|2.0|The Machine That Changed the World and the subsequent articles that Mr. Womack has written for the Wall Street Journal almost make him look like a shill for Toyota.  This book either omits or minimizes the importance of developments that lead Toyota to the Toyota Production System.  I expected a more independent and intellectually honest viewpoint because Mr. Womack passes himself off as a top academic.
1594200823|3.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is not nearly as entertaining or thorough as Michael Pollan's previous book, The Botany of Desire, but it does have some great moments. I'd give the book more stars, but the second half fails to live up to the intensity and revelation of the first half, which ultimately makes the book of mixed quality.     In the first half of the book, Pollan's analysis of industrial American agribusiness is both concise and thorough. His deep exploration of the dominance of corn in the US is startling and upsetting, particularly because corn is neither sustainable environmentally (too much damaging fertilizer and soil quality reductions) nor economically (subsidies and bankruptcy for farmers); also, it's not healthy for humans, in the doses that we eat it (corn or corn products are to be found in almost all packaged foods and fast foods, from sodas to granola bars to meat to bread). For that matter, the corn is not healthy for cows or other livestock animals, either, as Pollan graphically explains in one section. The strong scientific basis for his assertions, as well as the anecdotal interviews with farmers regarding corn's economic effects, provide excellent and powerful information.    While the first half is a fascinating read, the second half of the book bogs down into an idiosyncratic memoir. Pollan's mushroom searches are interesting, but his sudden obsession with hunting wild pigs is bizarre. He focuses heavily on the \\"thrill\\" of the hunt and frequently quotes Ortega y Gassett to emphasize certain points, but these passages come across as a forced-romp through his newfound fetish for animal blood.     When Pollan strays from the scientific and economic issues regarding the food we eat, he seems to falter and lacks the drive, wit and intelligence that inform the first half of the book.    I also took issue with his superficial treatment of vegetarianism, which was both imprecise and not fully explored. As other reviewers have pointed out, his casual assertion that, even if the country became vegetarian, there might not be a reduction in animal slaughter, is simply incorrect. Given Pollan's skills for thorough research, his tossed-off references to vegetarianism were remarkably weak and betray his gifts as a writer and researcher. The heavy emphasis on hunting and the lax treatment of vegetarianism as an alternative came across as biased and betrayed the reader of a more balanced view of various diets.
074356619X|5.0|Love the book, love the DVD and love the CD set.  Very helpful info to make your life better.
0321344758|5.0|In a sense, I already knew every bit of advice that was in this book.    Then why is the book great?  Because, like a lot of people, I will frequently ignore my own common sense in favor of doing something I think is more 'clever'.    The book is like having a nice friend who constantly re-focuses your attention back to common-sense principles and away from 'clever' solutions.    As an example, when building a web-site, I debated how to color/stylize the site's hyperlinks.  in an effort to reduce 'noise', i styled the hyperlinks without the traditional underline that most hyperlinks have.      This works great when you know where all the hyperlinks are, but when you dump someone onto the page for the first time, they *will* struggle (even if it's just a little bit) to figure out what's clickable.    This book made me go back and make things more obvious.    if i could give it 10 stars, i would.
B00003CXBK|5.0|A brilliant story that manages to be exciting without resorting to endless bloody violence. Don't get me wrong, I like hack and slash as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see a story that does things in a different way.     The animation itself is beautiful, and the english translation was done by Neil Gaiman, so the dialouge is witty and clear, unlike many other transations of Japaneese films.     If you haven't seen it, you should really try this. You'll like it.
B000F9RB94|3.0|For starters, I will assume that anyone reading this has seen the movie and thus I will not spend time talking about what a fun (if a little bit campy) action flick this is.    Out of the dozen or so Blu-ray movies I've seen so far, this was the least impressive.  I'm avoiding using words like \\"disappointing\\" because it isn't--the picture quality is amazing.  The lossless audio track, however, left something to be desired.  It just didn't impress the way tracks from movies like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" or \\"The Patriot\\" do.    Also--and this could just be old age setting in--but I could swear there's some missing scenes from the theatrical version.  The Bonus Features on this disc are impressively packed, with many deleted scenes and other extras.  I could be wrong, so I won't count against it in the review, but it seems shorter than it should be.    That said, if you are a Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez or Colin Ferrell fan, this is a great flick to own.  It's unfortunate that L.L. didn't have more screen time as his performances are always over-the-top in an entertaining way.  My advice?  Wait for a good sale on this one and snap it up.  It'll make a great addition to your Blu library.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity provides great closure to a great TV series and is a heck of a stand alone film. If Firefly doesn't do it for you, then nevermind, but if you get hooked on FF, you'll have no choice but to see the film.
0785814531|3.0|Edgar A. Poe was an amazing poet and story teller, and I would strongly urge anyone to purchase one of his complete tales and poems volumes. The Castle Books (2002) version is nicely bound and a great price. HOWEVER, the top of each right hand page reads \\"Complete Tales and Poems\\" rather than displaying the name of the story or poem on that page. While only a minor detail, I like to flip through volumes of this size, and this small problem drives me crazy! I don't know whether other versions (Doubleday, Barnes & Noble, etc.) have a similar issue, but if you have OCD like me, you might try one of those instead.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I hate to admit it, but I was hesitant after hearing how \\"uncommercial\\" this album was.  I wondered if Kelly had become spoiled after becoming so successful with her \\"Breakaway\\" album.  Then I thought, maybe this is one of those albums that really grows on you after a while, but it might take a few listens to really appreciate it.  Then I bought it, listened to it, and was completely and utterly blown away by it.  I honestly can't believe Mr. Owen didn't like this album.  Yes, it's different from Breakaway, but songs like \\"One Minute,\\" \\"Hole,\\" and \\"Yeah\\" have plenty of hooks on them, and other songs are so vocally impressive that I automatically hit the replay button.  (\\"Sober\\" starts out so slow and moody and grows into an explosion of emotion that i was completely unprepared for).  All in all, you won't find another \\"Since U Been Gone\\" on this album, but all this talk about it being a total flop and uncommercial is ridiculous.  After only two listens, I like this album WAY more than Breakaway, and Kelly Clarkson has become the first official American Idol winner to show true artistry.

0743298020|1.0|The themes and subject matter might make for a great story, but the author just doesn't get it done.  The author seems to convince many of her fans that it's a great book merely by raving in the book about reading books -- so much so that the book's narrator recounts falling from a wall as if swimming because she was so lost in a story about Water Babies.  The author seems enamored with imagination for imagination's sake... even when it's neither compelling nor interesting nor suspenseful.  Granted, I only finished the first 100 pages or so, but the author's \\"voice\\" was simply too much to bear.  I'm surprised by the many rave reviews.  And as a final gratuitous shot, the author's pretentious picture and pose on the back cover should have been an obvious signal to let this one go.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I am amazed at how Helen Mirren captured the essence of the real Queen Elizabeth!  I have seen this movie several times now and I am still awe struck by her performance.  The story line is very good and brought back memories of that time in history.  The supporting actors were very good as well.
B000SW4DLM|5.0|This is a profound movie; the visual world Syd Mead created is a mind-blowing abstraction of a capitalist-ruled society. Profits over people, and intelligent lifeforms as commodities for our whims. While not always sticking to the focus of the replicants as \\"emerging humans\\" --not unlike children learning the mores of social interaction-- Blade Runner soars for its examination of the question, \\"Once we can create life on the human level, what seperates us from them? Why do we deserve to live, given that the replicants ultimately want to understand what it is to be human?\\" This film posits serious questions and morals that are more relevant today than ever, now that we are at the dawn of the age of biotechnology.\\" This film caught my attention a decade ago (thx blade runner pc game!) and I am still enthralled with what this movie stands for. If you envision a future that's dirty, corrupt and as unpredictable as the present, this is YOUR movie.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I've seen the U.S.A. version of Planet Earth and Sigourney Weaver does a good job. However, this version narrated by David Attenborough is beyond a good job; it is superb. There is more information, more depth and, frankly, Attenborough sounds more involved in the planet than Weaver does. Share this with your family and friends. It is an ongoing, informative, thought-provoking work of art.

0393039102|5.0|What an incredible book I was not able to put down. I am a big military history buff and found the early pacific theater defeats very disturbing especially the battles in and around Malaya.    The treatment of Mr. Lomax was not surprising as the Japanese were ruthless. Putting this experience into such a personal and riveting ordeal makes this book a must read. Eric Lomax puts personal vivid perspective on the years after his ordeal that is often left out of most military history accounts of battle, defeat and capture.    This book is very cathartic and brought tears to my eyes. Forgiveness is a more powerful emotion and triumphs over anger and revenge.

B000021Y7X|5.0|Jonathan Demme's infectious first outing captures the ecstatic fervor of the Talking Heads at the very peak of their fame, but it is much more than a filmed performance: Working from an idea hatched by super-quirky frontman David Byrne, \\"Sense\\" opens with Byrne's solo rendition of \\"Psycho Killer\\" (accompanying himself on boombox) and builds, song by song and player by player, to a roof-raising climax with \\"Burning Down the House.\\" Demme's film is an uplifting, concept-driven dance party that avoids all the clich&eacute;s.

B00003CX9S|5.0|Filmed in eerie black and white by \\"Blue Velvet\\" director David Lynch, this dour, heartbreaking drama about the real-life Merrick, known as \\"the Elephant Man,\\" perfectly captures the gloomy, gothic atmosphere of late-19th-century England. But it also relates a deeply compassionate story, with Hurt delivering a pained, Oscar-nominated performance through all the heavy make-up, and an understated Hopkins equally sensitive as Dr. Treves. With an excellent supporting cast including John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, and Wendy Stiller, \\"The Elephant Man\\" is a haunting tale that asks how we define humanity.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|It's a good CD, but compared to Funeral, it's not great... I don't blame them, I was expecting the second coming of Christ since their last one was so great. Still a fan, though.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Levinson's ingenious, slightly off-kilter road picture is also genuinely moving, offering a warm-hearted, humane look at disability. Though Cruise sometimes grates in an unsympathetic role, Hoffman's Raymond--a routine-oriented math genius with no coping or social skills--makes the movie. The actor is totally credible as an idiot savant with unexpected life lessons to impart to his younger brother, and this bravura performance earned Hoffman yet another Oscar, while the movie itself won for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay.
B000PKG4SC|5.0|Finally got this long awaited CD, and it doesn't dissapoint.  Great from beginning to end. Dame Shirley shows the world what real singing is all about.  Althougth some of the songs have been re-recorded, they are fresh and exciting.  I really love Big Spender , Kiss me Hone, Honey, and what else can you say about This Is My Life?    The tile track is sublime, and so is Where is the Love. A must have for all music lovers. You would never know this woman is 70years old listening to her voice!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The genius of Lucas's epic space-action saga is the way he draws on sources both popular (Flash Gordon, Westerns, comic serials of the 1940s) and refined (Kurosawa films) to create a universally endearing fantasy of unrivalled thrills, unexpected twists of fate, and plenty of hearty humor--not to mention spectacular chase scenes. The franchise is still going, but the first three films--tracing the exploits of the ragtag rebels in their quest to topple Vader's Empire--remain the best. Harrison Ford, as a roguish mercenary piloting a beat-up ship, steals nearly every scene he's in, especially playing off Fisher's feisty princess. With its archetypal characters and mythic storyline, the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy is an infinitely entertaining universe unto its own.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is the essential collection of Stevie Wonder.  This CD provides a great cross section of the many talents of Stevie Wonder from his early days to his experiments with funk and jazz. Nearly every song sounds different in style and form because of the breadth and depth of SW's career.  Great addition to the CD collection of you're a Stevie fan and you want a single representation of his fantastic career.
B000059TFO|5.0|Though detractors claim the movie inaccurately depicts a white FBI coming in to rescue helpless blacks, I disagree: the film features some extremely courageous black characters, and at the outset, the FBI seems more muddled than heroic. Regardless of debates on historical accuracy, the movie is breathlessly exciting and extremely well-played. Though McDormand was Oscar-nominated for the small but pivotal role of Mrs. Pell, the movie is Hackman's, as he turns in his most explosive performance since \\"The French Connection\\"(and he also got an Oscar nod).
B00005AREQ|5.0|Beck is AWESOME.  One of the most underrated guitarists I've heard...ever!  He's definitely every bit as good as (and probably better than) Vai, Satriani, or Wylde.  Beck has proven throughout the course of his career that he is talented, flexible in his style, and can play just about any type of music...WELL!     This is a \\"must have\\" CD for anyone who loves to hear a great guitarist and appreciates the complexities and nuances of what is going on with the instrument during the song, regardless of the type of music. I would also highly recommend Jeff Beck \\"Guitar Shop\\" and \\"You Had it Coming\\".
B00008R9KF|5.0|Originally made for the BBC, and scripted by half-Pakistani writer Hanif Kureishi, Frears's endearing, intelligent \\"Laundrette\\" is a dramatic and often humorous study of bigotry, sexuality, and social mobility in Thatcher-era Britain. Warnecke and Day-Lewis are convincing as distinct social types in eighties London--the striving immigrant under pressure to acculturate on one hand and marry a family acquaintance on the other; and the skinhead who turns on his mates to pursue a friendship with a loathsome \\"Paki.\\" Coaxing fine support from his multiracial cast, Frears handles it all with tenderness, insight, and unpredictable tonal shifts.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|We all know the Beatles were the greatest. What people aren't discussing here is the sound quality of the disc. It is incredible! I bought a new Acura RDX which is one of the only vehicles that has DVD Audio true surround sound in it. The sound is amazing! Every instrument is so clear and distinct. It is all around you. Even Paul McCartney was amazed at the quality of the surround sound recording! Once you hear a good DVD Audio disc, it is hard to go back to traditional discs.
B000LPS47U|5.0|Stuart Gordon's hilariously campy gore-fest is loosely based on a story by H.P. Lovecraft, but draws heavily on old-fashioned horror like \\"Frankenstein\\" and George Romero's zombie flicks. Combs gives his Herbert just the right mix of nerdy gravitas and lunatic ambition, while Gale vamps it up as a jealous prof who literally loses his head over his student's potion, only to commit a foul act with the dean's daughter, played by comely Barbara Crampton. Things get grisly when bone-saws are marshalled to quell the violent, re-animated cadavers, but it's all in good fun. Like a version of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" directed by the staff of Mad Magazine, \\"Re-Animator\\" will keep you in stitches.
0743482883|5.0|This was the first Linda Howard book I have ever picked up, and is thusfar the best.  It's some lite entertainment as most popular fiction is, and the murder story actually made sense with the story flow.  Even I didn't anticipate the twist at the end!<br /><br />Four friends (a la their counterparts in Sex In The City) - Jaine, Marci, Luna and TJ - are having their usual Friday night get together at a bar / restaurant after work.  The subject goes to their man troubles.  TJ's marriage is rocky.  Luna has a boyfriend who is a professional football player and worries about his out of town antics she may or may not know about.  Marci is thrice divorced and lives with her big brute of a boyfriend, Brick, who is just a lump on the couch.  And Jaine, the leader, is dateless and annoyed at her neighbor across the street.  In the spirit of fun, they make up a list of qualities that Mr. Perfect should have, from Boy Scout qualities to the more raunchy stuff.  Eventually the list gets out, is then posted on the Internet, and the four of them suddenly find themselves in the middle of their fifteen minutes of fame, ending it with an appearence on Good Morning America.<br /><br />The List, as it comes to be known, causes more problems than it does a good laugh, and has a lot of latent effects to it.  TJ's marriage, already on shakey ground, seems to be hanging by a thread as her husband is angry with her.  But, TJ refuses to back down and apologize, saying that if he doesn't like it he can take it or leave it.  Then she kicks him out for the night.  (CHECKMATE!)  Luna's boyfriend, Shemal, comes home and says he will change his ways.  Marci's boyfriend Brick, while seemingly stupid and oblivious to all but drinking beer, is surprisingly hurt and leaves her.  And Jaine, the one who started it all, suddenly finds herself changing her mind about the obnoxious neighbor Sam across the street.<br /><br />And, what no one expected, was that someone else read The List and decides to take out their rage and frustration on them.  Because they had the gaul to suggest that HE wasn't Mr. Perfect.<br /><br />This was the first Linda Howard book I ever picked up and expected all past/present/future works to be just as good.  Unfortunately, almost none of them have lived up to the promise that this book provided.  This was a fast paced book, a lite read that is entertaining without being too preachy or over the top about the classic battle of the sexes topics.  It's a good time with punchy dialogue.
B0007G89G4|5.0|Based on Stephen King's story \\"The Body,\\" Reiner's bittersweet coming-of-age pic set in a small Oregon town is narrated by Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Gordie as an adult recalling a momentous time in his youth. Strong performances from the young quartet of actors, especially the late Phoenix, lifted this nostalgic tale above the fray and made it a sleeper hit in 1986. Reiner's focus on the things that fascinate boys on the cusp of teen-hood is insightful, honest, and memorable. Watch for future \\"24\\" star Kiefer Sutherland as a merciless teen bully, and don't mind the leeches.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of the very best CDs ever made, and one of the ONLY ones I've ever found that I can listen to from beginning to end and never skip past a single song.  I think there's maybe four or five others in the world that I can say that about, and I listen to almost all types of music, from Mozart to Enya to Tool to Billie Holiday to Simon and Garfunkel to Staind to... anyway, it's a masterpiece.  Some music snobs like to turn up their noses at Evanescence and mock those who listen to them because they're generally thought of as \\"Teenage Goth\\", but I have a message for them: GET OVER YOURSELVES!!  BY BEING NARROW MINDED YOU ARE ONLY DEPRIVING YOURSELVES OF SOME OF THE BEST, MOST HAUNTING MUSIC YOU COULD ASK FOR!!  I listen to this CD ALOT and I never get tired of it.  Amy Lee is amazing!  TRY IT!!!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The exhilarating feature by \\"Spirited Away\\" director-animator Miyazaki, \\"Nausicaa\\" is an epic masterpiece about an issue very much on the minds of young people today: sustainable living and the future of our planet. Borrowing its apocalyptic scenario from Miyazaki's own manga originals, this dark fantasia pits a band of warrior activists against the encroachment of a poisonous environment. As always with Miyazaki, this is a world where good and evil coexist, sometimes in the same character. Splendid visuals, great voice acting by Thurman, Stewart, and Lohman, and an absorbing finale make this a science-fiction film with a heart, mind, and message.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|For one scant second when I was a chld, I thought this movie was better than Empire Strikes Back...time has assured me it isn't but you know what...it kinda is. I mean, first off, the QUEEN soundtrack is unbelievable. Such rocking and campiness for a rocking, campy movie. And the colors!!! The look of the skies in all their psychedelic glory, the costumes, the Hawkmen, the Robin hood looking guys, Aura....whoo-my! Anyway, like I said, I never had ANY edition on DVD so I don't really care for the commentary anyway. Just relax, sit back, have a smoke and enjoy.
B0000683DH|5.0|After a sluggish, bloated first \\"Star Trek\\" movie, director Meyer steers the franchise back to more familiar and exciting territory with this entry. The gang's all here, and Shatner's particularly good as a more seasoned, philosophical Kirk. Montalban seems to enjoy playing the venomous Khan as much as we do watching him. Hit warp speed, and catch this lively, family-friendly science fiction adventure.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Bought this album just for the heck of it a few years ago.  Never heard Muse before.  What an amazing album..  Every song has it's own groove and feel to it.  It's like riding a rollercoaster of greatness.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Staggering in its scope and power, \\"Kagemusha\\" features soulful acting, breathtaking visual sequences, and at its heart, a mortal tragedy worthy of Shakespeare. Kurosawa not only tells a whopping good yarn rooted in historic reality, he uses the vulgar, but wrenchingly sympathetic figure of Nakadai's thief to explore questions of identity and the theatrical nature of political power. In addition, Kurosawa's painterly use of color (especially during several large-scale battle set pieces, for which he used five cinematographers) and his haunting, slow-motion dream sequences are simply unparalleled. Made with the help of George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, \\"Kagemusha\\" is a somber late masterpiece by one of the world's greatest filmmakers.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Great and wonderful movie.  My friend loves it and was excited to receive it as a gift.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Based on LaMotta's memoirs and filmed in gorgeous black-and-white, Martin Scorsese's gritty, no-holds-barred drama--possibly his greatest--tackles the familiar theme of redemption with blunt force. Oscar winner De Niro, who famously packed on 50 pounds to do the \\"fat\\" scenes, is riveting as the brutish Jake, whose primary talent lies in the amount of punishment he can take in the ring. The fight sequences--raw, sweaty, and savage--are bravura pieces of filmmaking. \\"Raging Bull\\" may be hard for some viewers to sit through, but Scorsese ultimately leads his protagonist, and us, to a state of grace.
B00005KARK|5.0|Perfect and wonderful.  As described.  Great movie to buy at a great price.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|Writer-director Beatty's Oscar-winning portrait of leftie scribe John Reed and his paramour Bryant is equal parts sweeping historical epic, tragic romance, and paean to the once influential voices of early American socialism. His ingenious use of actual interviews with those who knew the Greenwich Village couple--including Henry Miller and Rebecca West--gives the picture an extra depth and dramatic veracity. But it's the chemistry between Beatty's uncompromising Reed, a man devoted to the principle of class struggle, and Keaton's fiercely independent Bryant that's sure to rouse your inner rebel. With terrific support from Maureen Stapleton (as Emma Goldman), and Jack Nicholson (as cynical playwright Eugene O'Neill), \\"Reds\\" is a film that embraces love and politics without giving short shrift to either.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|Wow! I mean, where to begin? Ok, first good old Sly Stallone is the star of the show, as well as co-writer of the screenplay. If that doesn't scream B to you then you're just not listening. There are just so many elements of B in this one. Namely the fact that they can't even decide if Sly's character's name is Lincoln Hawk or Lincoln Hawks. Then there's the great parenting skills displayed by Sly. The first time he sees his son in 10 years, he takes him to his big rig and tries to arm-wrestle him. The aforementioned big rig is equipped with a Lincoln original forearm press machine so he can hone his arm-wrestling skills while driving. Pure genius!<br /><br />Hawk is going to need the practice to face...Bull Hurley! This imposing 5 time world arm-wrestling champ's mantra is \\"I drive truck, break arms, and arm-wrestle.\\" How you can take that in and not be rivited, I'll never know. Sid the Elf noticed something watching Over the Top. Most of Sly's movies are pretty much the same premise with interchangable plots and characters. To the B novice, Sly isn't the first name that comes to mind, but think again. Sly is that rare person who has a big name, but is really B with very few people making the observation. But thats what we, Sid the Elf are here for.<br /><br />This classic B flick easily recieves the Sid the Elf Seal of Approval.  Do yourself a favor and buy this one for years of priceless entertainment. This movie is a great choice for the novice B viewer due to it's sheer ridiculous content.  What other film can you find a competitor whose pre game meal is a cigar and a jug a valvoline motor oil?  We could go on until next weeks B review, but we'll end here.  Again if you are up for a good old fashioned B evening, pick up this work of art.  Just a heads up, be on the look out for a packed month of Sly reviews most likely starting in August.
B000BB14YY|5.0|Kurosawa's late-career triumph is a vibrant, colorful epic, its drama magnified by an awesome visual sweep encompassing both period pageantry and setting. Shakespeare's fundamental themes of loyalty and betrayal play out with full force, thanks to superb performances by both Nakudai (a Kurosawa veteran) and Ryu in the pivotal roles. Another breathtaking achievement from this revered master of cinema.
0374105235|5.0|This book was amazing.  I could not put it down until I finished it.  It made me think about how lucky my family and I are to live in the U.S. and never have to experience such horror.  I didn't cry until the next day after I read it and was thinking about it this poor young boy who was turned into a murdering monster and all of the things he went through.  It really is the story of a lost childhood.  Wonderfully written.
B00005AFMT|5.0|this album rocks.especially the song,\\"indiscipline\\".im glad i found this on amazon.big loss for i tunes for not putting this on their catalog.
B000CFLFX4|2.0|I bought mine two years ago. It worked great at first but after a while one part or another would break, wear down, stop working after a year.  I ordered another one and it lasted less than a year.  Battery doesn't last either - after a while it wouldn't charge the sweeper at all.  I have replaced the battery three times in two years.  Parts are expensive to buy - a battery with s/h could cost almost as much as getting a new sweeper from the store.  I bought another one last spring and now neither of my sweepers works - the old and the new one!  True, it does not work on carpet - great on wood floors but it is not reliable & you'll be disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend it.
0743496728|4.0|Jodi Picoult had a way of making you care about her charcters - even a killer.  I am enlightend.
0060536357|5.0|This book, written in 1990, tells the detailed story of one of the largest Wall Street deals of all time - the leveraged buyout of the RJR Nabisco Corporation. The authors, Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, are former Wall Street Journal reporters. They spent many hours interviewing the players involved, and, in so, have come up with a very thorough (and presumably accurate) description of the events that took place.<br /><br />Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, decided to take the company private. Officially, his reason was to improve shareholder value, since the RJR Nabisco stock was undervalued (and Johnson's attempts to boost it have failed). His other reasons may have included money and the constant urge to change things up. He teamed up with Shearson Lehman Hutton to make a bid to the board. In their shortsightedness, this \\"management group\\" did not expect anyone else to compete - due to the sheer size of the deal. However, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. made a tender offer, which started off a bidding war between the two groups (and a few third party bidders). This book describes everything in detail - starting with how Johnson got to Nabisco - and finishing off with a gripping climax of Shearson and KKR's final bid war.<br /><br />It is a long narrative, over 500 pages long. The authors take a lot of side tangents to describe many personal biographies. I found those of major players (like Ross Johnson and Henry Kravis) very interesting, and those of lesser-involved people somewhat excessive. Nevertheless, I was never tempted to skip over paragraphs or pages, as I sometimes am in lengthy books with lots of characters.<br /><br />The authors clearly have done a lot of research. I liked that they included footnotes when stories from different people didn't match up. I also like the photographs included in the book - they put faces on the people described so thoroughly. The \\"Players\\" section in the beginning of the book is also very helpful - it lists the names of almost everyone involved in the deal.<br /><br />The narrative is great. The story is gripping, with many twists and surprises. We learn about the multiple final bids submitted by KKR and the management group, the backstabbing plots, and the emotions and broken spirits behind the closed doors. It's as if we are there amidst the board meetings - kudos to the authors for their great writing.

015603252X|5.0|This is a gem of a book. The autobiography of Israel's most popular author, this story is full of warmth, passion and heartache. It is the story of his childhood in Israel during the time of statehood, while including the childhoods of his parents in Eastern Europe just before World War II.   I highly recommend this book.

B000OY8NII|4.0|Upon discovering the answer to a now-legendary problem, Archimedes famously yelled \\"Eureka!\\" (\\"I have found it!\\"), jumped out of his bath, and ran naked through the streets.<br /><br />So \\"Eureka\\" seems like an appropriate name for the Sci-Fi Channel's quirky, well-written sci-fi series, all about a tiny town that brims over with geniuses and scientific breakthroughs. A few of the storylines are draggy, but the series also has some great acting, brilliant dilemmas, and mysteries that promise to fuel future seasons.<br /><br />While dragging his delinquent daughter back to L.A., Marshal Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson) accidentally crashes the car. The only nearby place is the picture-perfect small-town of Eureka. But Jack starts to suspect that Eureka is a little odd -- a woman making triangular bubbles, a quartet of clones, and a little autistic boy making physics equations on the sidewalk are only a few of the oddities.<br /><br />His suspicions are confirmed when random places get blasted to ashes, including a cowfield and an RV. So Jack is told Eureka's secret -- it's a town entirely inhabited by geniuses, set up by the government to create new scientific advances. But a scientist has done a little project all on his own, producing a tachyon accelerator -- which is ripping the seams out of the universe.<br /><br />Because the sheriff was badly injured by the accelerator, D.O.D. representative Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) makes Jack the new sheriff of Eureka. Now he has a new job, a \\"smart house\\" in an old nuclear bunker, and a trigger-happy deputy who loves her guns.<br /><br />But he also has has to deal with a bunch of strange problems -- an electrical \\"ghost,\\" a scientist whose healing experiments transform him, alien paranoia, memory blackouts, a doomsday device from the Cold War, a drug that causes superspeed, killer nanites, problematic pollen, and a mysterious Artifact deep inside the Global Dynamics building...<br /><br />The first season of \\"Eureka\\" is a pretty good example of how to make a sci-fi show -- not many programs can balance out standalone episodes with long-term arcs (the Artifact, Beverly's agenda). Some of these don't work out, like the artificial Jack/Allison attraction, but most of the time \\"Eureka\\" stays on solid ground.<br /><br />Yeah, most of the storylines center on scientific disasters. But the writers sprinkle it with funny scenarios (the baseball teams are called the Protons and Neutrons) and funny dialogue (\\"Well, car or no car, this is a 30 mile an hour zone\\"). But there are moments of poignancy, such as Nathan Stark's tearful farewell to his robot \\"son,\\" or a woman reluctantly starting to care about her clone's little son.<br /><br />Despite being the lead, Ferguson doesn't stand out as much because his character is so... ordinary. It's the weirdos that are lovable -- Matt Frewer as a deranged Aussie vet, Ed Quinn as a charming head researcher (and Allison's ex-hubby), Neil Grayston as an ubergeek, and Joe Morton as the car mechanic who also happens to be a brilliant inventer. Jordan Hinson rounds off the cast as Jack's troublemaking daughter.<br /><br />The first season of \\"Eureka\\" hits some road bumps, but it's definitely a well-written, intelligent sci-fi series with a quirky, funny twist.

B000OQF6N6|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins are back. The legendary rock band, which blossomed like a dark rose in the musical wasteland of the 1990s.<br /><br />Okay, only frontman Billy Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin have returned from the original lineup, and the absences can be detected. But their return album \\"Zeitgeist\\" is still worthy of epic praise -- dark, passionate hard-rock, written with a darkly poetic sweep.<br /><br />The drums smash, the bass roars like unleashed tornado. \\"Is everyone afraid?/Is everyone ashamed?/They're running towards their holes to find out/Apocalyptic thieves/Are lost amongst our dead,\\" Corgan drawls, telling us a story of gas masks, Kafka and fear.<br /><br />It's followed with the roiling rocker \\"7 Shades of Black,\\" with the level of depression you'd expect (\\"And without peer/And without fear/I'm without anyone at all!\\"). Then it pours into a series of blazing hard-rockers -- soaring grimy epics, buzzing and cascading bass rockers, a stripped-down melodic tune, and the soaringly exquisite \\"Pomp and Circumstances,\\" which is only marred by Corgan singing \\"la la la la...\\"<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" probably won't be gently compared to the Pumpkins' earlier classics, especially since it doesn't have James Iha and D'arcy Wretzy from the original lineup -- valuable talents both. But taken on its own virtues, it's brilliant hard-rock -- epic, dark, and with moments of sheer poetry woven into the stormy music.<br /><br />If I had a main complaint, it would be that the softer songs are rare here, and that the bass doesn't have that epic quality in some of the songs. But Corgan is blazingly passionate in his playing, layering and building a storm of driving guitar and fuzzy bass. He pushes on the fiery melodies of each song, with Chamberlin smashing the drums beside him. These guys sound kinetic.<br /><br />And Corgan's nasal voice sneers and drawls through the harder songs, but he can also sound wistful and tender, like when he sings, \\"that's the way my love is.\\" And he pours plenty of passion into his songs, which seem to balance out between the happy and sad -- on one side, a crumbling, bitter apocalypse, and on the other, \\"no shadows follow me unsung.\\"<br /><br />Some of his songs aren't up to par lyrically, like \\"God and Country.\\" But Corgan spins his weird poetry in other songs, like the the ethereal \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\": \\"Torn, broken and frayed/Oh don't we face/War, sunshine and grace/Oh won't you stay/For a while/We can fail in style...\\"<br /><br />The Pumpkins aren't quite all they once were here, but Corgan and Chamberlin are enough to make \\"Zeitgeist\\" a brilliant hard-rock album with some vintage flourishes.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Frank Miller adaptations are on a roll. First we got \\"Sin City,\\" and now we have the story of three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming power.

B000FVNX2Q|4.0|Recently purchased the HP12 C platinum financial calculator. Firstly, the price on Amazon is about 20% cheaper than what I found in Staples. Secondly, it takes a fair amount of time to read the manual & get to know the calculator.  But once you get the hang of it, it is a fabulous instrument.  I would definitely recommend this for all finance professionals.
B000002B2X|5.0|I love this CD. It shows that even heavy grungers can have a semi soft side.
0316067598|3.0|Once you get to the point where the author starts into the details of his ordeal this book is pretty riveting.  It's getting to this point that is the key.  Over half the book the author talks about his pre-BUD/S days and then his BUD/S training.  After reading a couple dozen pages of how difficult the training was and how great he felt he was I was a bit dismayed as the title was promising but the substance of the book left a lot to be desired.  As you read the book you get a definite sense of how great the author thinks he is but as the old saying says \\"it ain't bragging if you can do it\\".  Dick Couch writes much better books about BUD/S and SEAL qualification training if that is what you want to read.  However, as I mentioned once you get through the first half of the book his story is a remarkable one for sure.    If I could ask the author some questions one would be:  isn't it \\"alpha\\" and not \\"alfa\\" when referring to something in the military like \\"alpha platoon\\"?  If the terrain is as described in the book as shear mountainsides did you consider a tactical mistake to give up the high ground?  What was the \\"post mortem\\" on the comm's failure?  I think answers to the last two questions would have added a lot to the substance of the book.    All in all a decent read but wait for it come out in the paperback version.

B000OYC3J8|4.0|Back when Elephant came out in 2003, The White Stripes renewed my faith in popular music. From then on I began to listen to (and love) more music than ever before, and The White Stripes led that train.<br />After a while (and after Get Behind Me Satan) I sort of tuned out to The White Stripes. While I really did (and still do) like GBMS, it just didn't fulfill my expectations: a whole CD in the rock style of what the first single Blue Orchid promised.<br />And then there was a bump, on my trunk, on the wagon to Mexico -<br /><br />Icky Thump!<br /><br />I have now fallen in love with The White Stripes again. I won't bore you with descriptions of all the songs, because other reviewers do that. What really needs to be taken from this review is that Icky Thump has the nice sounding folkiness that De Stijl owned (Bound To Pack it Up), the simple brilliant brashness of White Blood Cells (Fell in Love With a Girl), and the matured sound of Elephant (Seven Nation Army) all rolled into one album. This is not simply a \\"compilation\\" type album, but instead has the feeling a Led Zeppelin album brings of hearing a song that sounds familiar, but in some mysterious way seems totally new.<br /><br />Jack and Meg do just that with Icky Thump. They remind us who they are, intertwine some of the quirkiness of their last album, and sprinkle it all with dabs of ingenious to make what might have been a mediocre song, something that is worthy of the term \\"Rock and roll\\".<br /><br />Now I'm back on the wagon (to Mexico apparently) with Jack and Meg. 'Cause they've definitely got me hooked again. There's no doubt.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I just finished watching Miss Potter and can say without a doubt that it is one of the best movies I have seen all year. An excellent cast, gorgeous fiming, and a wonderful, funny, and sad story that actually made me cry which I am not known to do! I raely feel compelled to review or recommend films to anyone, but this film is appropiate for everyone and desrves a viewing soon!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|As a musician I have really enjoyed this album so far, as I am writting this review, I have listened to half the CD.  But already I love it.  As much as I enjoy a good Williams score, he does recycle many of his themes from different movies.  It just gets old.  This soundtrack breathes new lide into the movie series.
0747572593|5.0|This book was given to me on an airplane and I read it because I had nothing else to read.  I had seen the movie and thought it was OK.  The book however, I absolutly loved.  The movie focused primarily on the English Patient, but the book was different in that you got to know each character quite intimately.  They all were in the house for different reasons and each of them had very unique and intrieging backgrounds.  I was sucked in immediately.  Each charachter is developed and you are able to understand who they are and why. All of their strengths and weaknesses are revealed and they are quite vulnerable.  If you are someone who likes to bond with a characters and watch them develop, this book is for you.
B00005JKNF|5.0|You can read the other reviews for the plot outline. Superb acting and fantastic plot outline and directing. Everyone is believable. Maggie Smith gives an exceptional performance, and the intertwined yet distanced relationships between the upstairs and downstairs inhabitants is perfection. Clive Owen (Parks) and Kelly MacDonald (Mary) are fantastic, and their small, rather chaste kiss was only an almost-satisfying culmination of their friendship/romance. However both their characters were supremely well-acted. Emily Watson plays Elsie to a T...completely believable, superbly acted. The costumes, sets, and every detail were wonderful...everything believable. Jeremy Northam singing was a delightful surprise and bonus to the film. A complete success...an intricate, interesting study of reactions, relationships, and snobbery. Gosford Park epitomizes quality movie-making, with about the best cast imaginable.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I am proud to say, I literally have not missed an episode of this show since it started!   I look forward to the DVD set, tho, I wish it wasn't being released on the date that it is since to us New Yorkers, that date isn't exactly one to want to be remembered.  But...it will still be fun to finally get it and watch the episodes at my leisure.   The gag reels are hysterical and I just love watching Jared & Jensen together. Not only are they good eye candy, I just like watching them work as actors. Their chemistry as brothers is amazing and for me, when you can watch two people work together and forget that they are saying lines from a script really says something to me!  Even tho at times I was worried that the show might not make it to a third season, I really hope it lasts a good long time coz my Thursday nights wouldn't be the same without it.

0385513755|5.0|Wonderful book, wonderful illustrations, enthralling mystery...it's a good STORY, which is what even the author said during the interviews done with him on the motion picture.

B0000AXE8I|2.0|There are a couple spoilers in this review, but none give away the ending.<br />If we were to cut all the filler out of The Matrix: Reloaded, we'd be left with a ten-minute movie. On the other hand, if we were to cut all the filler out of The Matrix, we'd be left with a 136 minute movie. Scenes in The Matrix: Reloaded are either unnecessary but cool fight scenes, necessary but boring dialog scenes, an unnecessary, endless AND boring chase scene; an unnecessary and nearly unwatchable sex scene, or (just occasionally) necessary and cool dialog scenes.<br />First, the good. The special effects are excellent, as you'd expect. The fight scenes are mostly good: the rooftop battle between Morpheus and an agent (the sole highlight of the chase scene) and Neo's duel with the French guy (or the Merovingian - I'll just call him the French guy from now on)'s minions of doom are great, and the multiplying Agent Smith/Neo fighting with a ten-foot pole scene is decent, though overlong, indulgent, and stupid (that many Agents would have killed anybody else, but Neo is \\"The One\\", so of course he survives). The ghost-people that the French guy enlists also are interesting, but only in that they can do that phasing thing - otherwise, they're stock characters. The Oracle's still charming as ever, and the conversation between Neo and the Architect is good by this movie's standards.<br />Now for the bad. Other than the Architect, none of the new characters are at all interesting: the kid who idolizes Neo is annoying; the French guy is pompous, self-centered, and impossible to hear (He's soft-spoken and talks in a heavy accent); his wife is just a cold-hearted killer; Seraph (the Oracle's bodyguard) is totally useless; and the Keymaker just runs, hides, and randomly drops down dead. I guess Niobe is all right, but she doesn't have half the personality that other female characters Trinity , The Oracle and Switch had.<br />I say \\"had\\" there for two reasons; Switch obviously died, and Trinity is no longer an intriguing character either. In the first movie, she was, but all she seems concerned about now is screwing Neo. Speaking of Neo, his transformation into a Christ-like figure has robbed him of any personality - he does way too much of that \\"Superman s#@!\\" (including a self-indulgent flight scene \\"borrowed\\" from the Superman movies - taking a few cues from your dad, eh Keanu?), and simply doesn't seem like a person anymore. Morpheus has also suffered, mutating into a faceless revolutionary. He does a lot of wild-eyed, inconsequential shouting. Not much else. The dialog, too, is painfully bad.<br />So there you have it. A triumph of style over substance. A lot of slow-mo kicks (they could at least speed time up, just for variety's sake), explosions, techno music and Neo's Messianic posturing. Not much of a plot, though, and not much of a movie. Stick to the first - it's bound to become a classic. The Matrix: Reloaded is not.n intriguing character either.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|Yes, it's not like any of the old albums, it doesn't have the energy that their previous stuff used to have, but I must speak in their defense.  I believe the song, \\"Leave out all the rest.\\" is the best song they've ever written, and worth the price alone.  The lyrics relate to something we all struggle with,,( unless your sociopathic, then you should probably just shop for more death metal.)  Linkin Park has always written good songs and it's no diffrent here, even though they've made this album a little more diverse, and tried new things. SO, no matter what they do, I'll buy their albums.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I decided to buy this series after watching the movie Serenity. Even though I had never heard of the show before, I went on a limb and decided to get into it. This became the most amazing, and in turn, disappointing fact about the series. The positive is that I was able to buy every episode of the show for only $20. The disappointment came when I found out just how great the show was, making me want more.     This series is worth buying if you are interested in the story. My advice would be to watch Serenity, and if you like it even a small bit, buy the series. For the price it can't be beat.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version of Bronte's classic is a welcome distinction from some of the previous movie versions because of the sympathetic way in which Rochester is portrayed.  Although Ciaran Hinds and Timothy Dalton act the part famously, the new Rochester left me understanding why Jane Eyre would love him.  The playfulness, friendship, and developing romance drew me into a realization of how their relationship could progess to a state where they could 'hear' each other across distances.  I did miss some of the depth of Jane's life at Lowood School, but the intensity of the romance between Jane and Rochester overthrew any other disappointments.  Fantastic!

0316067598|5.0|Another reader review praised Lone Survivor and suggested it should be paired with The Unforgiving Tides by Ross Pennie as both books celebrate the contribution of the individual in the face of great adversity. Based on this review, I decided to pick up both books, and I'm very glad I did.  Both books are astonishingly engaging and interesting true life accounts of individuals making a positive difference in remote regions of our world. Both books relate tales of courage and determination and both are very, very inspiring.  In Sole Survivor, the contribution is chiefly a military one, that of bringing justice and freedom to an impoverished people. In the Unforgiving Tides, the contribution is medical: A young doctor just out of medical school goes to a remote island in the South Pacific Ocean and confronts hostility, indifference, witch doctors and harmful magic while bringing proper health care to a forgotten people. In doing so, Dr. Pennie has to perform his first appendectomy during an earthquake, amputate a patient's leg with a hacksaw and deal with bizarre customs, all with a sense of humor and a writing style that keeps you reading constantly to the end.  My heartfelt thanks to reviewer Sandra Brown for alerting me to both great books, I'm praising them both to everyone and I hope amazon pairs them to save my friends some money. I whole heartedly agree these are two wonderful books and I highly recommend both Sole Survivor and [[ASIN:0973647701 The Unforgiving Tides: The True Story of a Young Doctor's Encounters with Mud, Medicine, and Magic on a Remote South Pacific Island.]]

And this is quite an album - mellow but vibrant, soulful yet irreverent. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.    If nothing else, the title track warrants listening to. This CD was well worth purchasing.
0141439610|5.0|Collin's novel is the best example of Victorian mystery and suspense.  Full of tangential story lines and detailed, lush descriptions of nineteenth-century England.  A must-read for any student of literature and anyone interested in Victorian history and culture.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Prior to this movie, I had always wondered why they didnt adapt the frank miller versions of batman comics into movies, they always seemed to sinister, dark, the way i felt batman should always be portrayed.    Finally they did so. I admit when i went to the movies for this I didnt expect much considering the previous abomination of a series with george clooney and val kilmer involved but I was so wrong.    It held very close to the theme of the books and kept true to the dark nature, i believe was best intended for this character.    I cant wait for the next one with heath ledger as the joker, this is going to be exceptional!
0743298020|5.0|This great mystery novel about a biographer and a autor made me reasearch those people to find out that they actually were not real. So realistic described and engaging - I feel like i was there - in the library and with the giant and and - a book i didnt want to put down.... Great great read
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Its hard for sequals to follow up on a great first installment, especially as one as good as Blade.  There are two direction to go, which is stick close to the first film, so that the 2nd seems too much like the first, or go in a differect direction, which might take the story too far from the first film.  Blade 2 does the latter, which doesn't provide as an exciting and tightly-developed story as the first Blade, but the tons of action of the first film remains, along with a lot of fun and excitement.<br /><br />In Blade 2, a virus is transforming the vampires into a breed of supervampires, who are tougher, more agressive, and feed off of the normal vampires on a regular basis.  The leader of the vampire nation calls in an elite team of vampires known as the blood pack, who's leader is played by the impressive Ron Pearlman (Hellboy, Alien: Resurrection).  Among the team, is also a member played by Donnie Yen (Kill Zone, Shanghai Knights, Hero) for all you  martial art fans out there.  The team forms a very uneasy truce with Blade, in order to have some help defeating the supervampires and to seek out the vampire nation's leader's son - who has been turned into a supervampire too.  Whistler returns to the scene, which is a little confusing after the first film, since it appeared he shot himself.  However, Blade 2 decides to bring back his character and explains this in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Most of the movie is action packed, and great action at that.  The story isn't as sharp as the first, because a lot of screentime is devoted to hunting out the supervampires.  About 2/3 through though, story gets a bit more exciting and takes some twists and turns until the end.  As for the action, overall there is even more this time around, but several scenes overdo the cgi a little, and it is evident and distracting.  For fans of Donnie Yen, he has one very cool scene with exceptional choreography, and his character (though without any dialouge) is just bad (in the cool way).  Blade is not quite as cool as in the first film, but he's still just downright fun to watch.  He has a final fight against the leader's son, which is 3 minutes of one of the better fights I have ever seen.  I loved it more than the final fight in the first Blade.  This fight is even faster, harder, and longer.  It is definetly an edge of your seat fight.<br /><br />Blade 2 may not take itself quite as seriously as the first Blade, but it is almost more enjoyable in a fun kind of way.  Tons of action, plenty of gore, and even some frightening moments make it seem scarier than the first Blade.  A hardcore fan may be dissapointed with the direction the sequal took, but someone looking for an enjoyable movie will still love this..

B000K15VSA|5.0|This review is in the spirit of the reviewer who said that he posts reviews for products not officially announced as a way to express interest to the studios I have been waiting for this for awhile. I love this movie and want both the original and the director's cut along with the remastering.     I bypassed the limited edition remastered director's cut because I knew I wanted this. I hope to see it soon. I will buy it the day it is released barring a personal financial catastrophe.     Thanks for reading. Note: rating is for the director's cut movie and my anticipation for this product. Obviously I can't rate this product itself as it is not out yet.
B00007AJF9|4.0|I purchased this DVD because I thought it was interesting. And I'm glad I did. Cate Blanchett's performance was outstanding! She is a marvelous actress! In my opinion, she should have won the Academy Award as best actress. Unfortunately, however, since the Oscars are nothing more than a popularity contest, and because Gwyneth Paltrow was so popular at that time, she won. Anyway, great movie, with a magnificent Cate Blanchett. I look forward to seeing the sequel \\"Elizabeth, the Golden Age\\" coming out this fall.
B000001EC1|3.0|As far as greatest hits by the band, this I believe is the first one of studio cuts anyway. I saw this one in the Spring in the top Ten at Amazon, and was wondering why all the sudden interest in Bon Jovi, of course they did just come out with a new CD, and the new stuff is pretty good, me myself recently got the Remasters of their first 3 or 4 Cd's, and I admit that \\"Keep The Faith\\" was the last one I bought...But I did get the big box set of rarities 100 Million fans can't be wrong, so they are indeed my major rock guilty pleasure.    Is there no \\"Essential\\" Bon Jovi yet?, didn't see one...I was hoping for a 2 CD set of their hits along with a few deeper album cuts by now not that I need that, just that it would seem it's time for that since they've been around for 20 plus years now. Hopefully it isn't far off, this band deserves a better career collection than this one, I can't imagine the casual fan wanting this lacking set, even the order is strange. Of course the hardcore Bon Jovi fan likes about every one of their songs, maybe only 4 or 5 from the first album, but even I like most of the songs on 7800 degrees, and an essential would have to have Tokyo Road and Silent Night on it or I would not buy it. As far as Slippery, New Jersey...every song on those should be essential, maybe one or two left off...and that they are not on the greatest hits as this is known, is a major flaw. I'm thinking the ultimate Bon Jovi greatest hits set would have to have at least 4 songs each from the first two CD's, and then maybe 5 or 6 from Slippery, New Jersey, and Keep The Faith? That would fill out 2 Cd's I think and make a nice collection; better than this one for sure.      Hopefully fans new and old will get a better restrospective soon, this one is a nice start I guess, but I would highly recommend checking out their remastered catalog for more hits. They don't have many duds at all at least on their first 4 or 5 Cd's. The late 90's one's I don't know, perhaps an essential collection would contain some newer songs...but classic Bon Jovi is good enough for now.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Is this really a Smashing Pumpkins album? That's the question most people seemed to be concerned with, first and foremost, with regard to the \\"band's\\" new album \\"Zeitgeist\\" (2007).<br /><br />The cynicism is totally understandable. After all, only two musicians who were part of the original band that broke-up in 2000, actually play on the album, singer/songwriter Billy Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. The other members, bassist D'arcy and guitarist James Iha declined to join in on the reunion. On a related note, some people are wondering why Corgan is using the name \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" at all. After all, Chamberlin played on Corgan's side project ZWAN, for their lone album \\"Mary Star of the Sea\\" (2003). So why not just call this project ZWAN's second album as opposed to the Smashing Pumpkins sixth? (seventh if you include 2000s \\"Machina II\\").<br /><br />So is this CD just a cash-grab from Corgan, who wants to milk the name \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" for all its worth? Perhaps.  But while the cynic in me says that may be the case, I would still argue this to be a Smashing Pumpkins album.<br /><br />For better or worse, Corgan is, and always has been the Smashing Pumpkins. When the Pumpkins were officially \\"a band\\" throughout the 90s, in addition to being the band's lead singer/songwriter/guitar player, Corgan would also play over D'arcy and Iha's parts if he wasn't satisfied. Truth of the matter is, Iha and D'arcy were probably less important to the overall sound of the Pumpkins than Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell were to the sound of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. So if Corgan wants to resurrect the moniker \\"Smashing Pumpkins,\\" without the others, it's really his right to do so. Since Corgan is the major creative force in whatever project he undertakes, whether it is the Smashing Pumpkins, ZWAN or a Corgan solo album, the name doesn't really matter, as Corgan calls the shots. If he wants to make an album under the Smashing Pumpkins banner, more power to him.<br /><br />I think a lot of people want this album to bomb. There seems to be an almost irrational hatred towards Corgan, an artist that these same critics were praising a decade ago.  I've read a couple reviews and most of them mainly focus on how using the name \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" is intellectually dishonest and call Corgan a has-been, etc.<br /><br />I say enough already. Give the cue-ball a break. If it's a good album, it's a good album, if it sucks, it sucks; but at least judge \\"Zeitgeist\\" on its own merit...which brings me to my review...<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" is a good album. Is it that best I've ever heard or even the best Smashing Pumpkins album? No, but it's still a good CD.<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" is probably most comparable to the Pumpkins (official) swan-song \\"Machina/the Machines of God,\\" in that it's a straight-up rock album, for the most part  eschewing the dream-pop, \\"alternative\\" leanings of the band's early work. Compared to \\"Machina,\\" however, \\"Zeitgeist\\" sounds less polished and a little more organic. And while there are some ambitious moments on \\"Zeitgeist,\\" like the nearly ten-minute long \\"United States,\\" or the lush closing \\"Pomp and Circumstance,\\" the album overall is less arty, more meat-and-potatoes and to the point than its predecessor.<br /><br />Fans of the Pumpkins early work, \\"Gish\\" (1991) Siamese Dream, (1993) and \\"Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness\\" (1995) who didn't like the arena rocking \\"Machina\\" may be turned off by the sound and style of \\"Zeitgeist.\\" However, the new SP album should please those fans that did like \\"Machina\\" and should also please rock fans in general. So give ol' baldy a break, forget about the reasons for him using the name \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" and try to go into this CD with an open mind.this album to bomb.

B000OQF6N6|5.0|SP has always been about Billy Corgan.  I simply think this is his best work since \\"Adore\\" which was probably overlooked by all but the most ardent SP fans-- it was too different from other work and had no \\"1979\\" or \\"Today\\".  \\"Adore\\" has some great songs and beautiful guitar work.  It seems that after \\"Adore\\" Billy went off into sonics, as witness Zwan (just a lot of noise to me) and his solo work.  On \\"Zeitgeist\\" I declare that Billy the genius guitar hero is back.  Here the sonics work!  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Adore, though, for the beauty Billy's capable of producing.
B000N6UERK|4.0|Most Jerry Bruckheimer films look like beer commercials (lots of slow motion, close ups, sweat, etc.).  This film has those elements, but the plot is what sells the movie.  It is an innovative movie not only in terms of the effects, but also in terms of how time is portrayed (I won't spoil it with an explanation).  The Blu-ray version looks very nice.  You can see every pore on Denzel's face.  Some of the shots are very gritty, which I think Tony Scott intended on.  Despite that, the colors really pop and the sound is crisp and clear.  As a Blu-ray title, it's one of the best I've seen (Corpse Bride is still the absolute best transfer I've seen).  With shipping included, I paid less for this than I would for a regular DVD, so it was a great value.  Check it out.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|A few listens into this album and it hit me: This is the best pop record in a long time, particularly by a female.  The variety is its strength.  Just when you think you've figued out what this album is \\"about\\", an unexpected turn hits you out of nowhere and redirects your perceptions.  I've listned to it about 10 times through, and it's STILL happening.     Sure, \\"My December\\" is not as immediately endearing as \\"Breakaway\\" was; but it is a far better record.  Buy it; give it a chance.  You'll be glad you did.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|I think most fans can agree the the John Williams scores for the 1st three Harry Potter films where definitely the best in the franchise so far. Patrick Doyle took a different approach I think with the 4th film and sadly the result was lackluster compared to Williams brilliant work. When Nicholas Hooper was announced that he would be composing the score for the next Harry Potter film, I was astounded that Warner Bros. would allow such an unknown composer to compose the music for one of the biggest film franchises of all time. Needless to say I was worried and I think everyone else was a little hesitant as well. However, Hooper has brought back that sense of magical feeling that Williams so brilliantly captured.He does an outstanding job with this score. I highly recommend it for fans of the movie or fans of musical scores in general
B000PFUAO6|3.0|Well, having been a fan of DT since [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]], I must say that this album is a huge disappointment. DT reached their zenith with  [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]]. I've gotten used to most everything they doing seeming fairly average since then. This album, on the other hand, is half noise and half interesting but unrelated tracks. They demonstrated their ability to do a fairly pure heavy album with  [[ASIN:B0000CDLA7 Train of Thought]], which was a pretty good album. I'm not sure what they're trying to prove with this album. I would not be surprised to see James and/or Jordan leave prior to the next album, and I think we'll look back at DT in 10 years and identify this album as the point in time where they jumped the shark.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|nicolas hooper has done an excellent job recapturing the magic of the film through his score.  as i do feel that john williams did the most justice to the films as far as bringing the most vivid and real \\"images\\" out through the music, nicolas hooper is a close second.  he creates great images and incorporates williams' work without issue.  i didn't care for patrick doyle's work as much.  it wasn't terrible but it didn't present strong visuals or feelings of the movie and it didn't pull me in.  i did get the impression that he tried to use as little of the main theme as possible.  and when he did, he changed it quite a bit as if to stamp it his own.
B00006ADFL|4.0|I purchased this movie with great interest, as my maiden name WAS  Pauline Parker like the title character  and I had to see my namesake!!!  I thought the movie was very well done albeit odd. I would still recommend seeing it, if not just to see Kate Winslet when she was a little younger. Even then you can see what a fine actress she was becoming.
B000059T1G|5.0|I am a devoted Traffic fan and my love for their incredible music seems to grow stronger as time goes on. I saw the original Traffic trio perform in 1968 and still count it as one of the greatest of my live concert experiences ever. I have devoured all of the fantastic Traffic Remasters previously and Last Exit sounds as good or better than the others. I cranked up Shanghai in my car and was completely blown away by the perfection of writing, playing, singing and sound of this masterpiece. I wish there was more \\"hidden treasure\\" Traffic in the vault for future release but the fact that there probably isnt only makes the available jewels even that more precious.
B000FQWGAQ|5.0|and the sound is STUNNING. It comes in a LP mini sleeve with a very nice insert. No FBI logo, no UPC code on cover-they put love into this, one of 3 remasterings, and used a sticker on the outer cellophane wrapper instead.
B000MV8ABS|1.0|Everything about this movie had me and my friends written all over it when it was released. There wasn't a horror flick we wouldn't give at least the time of day. We went to watch almost every one of them, and this one came out our first, party saturated year out of high school, and part of an outdoor double feature at that! We were primed, pumped and ready for a great flick. We left within a half an hour. They talk about how groundsetting this flick was. To us, another way to put this was totally preposterous. We laughed, and \\"Oh brothered\\" our way as far as we could into this flick, until we just couldn't stand the absurdity any longer. Some say this movie broke the rules. That's not necessarily a good thing. We found the entire premise of this movie ridiculous in the extent it went to try to scare us. If I were thrust in the middle of this movie I wouldn't have been any less frightened. If you wanna buy into the product descriptin or Amazon review, go for it. I've bought into those sales pitches for movies I also thought were good, only to regret it later. Even when it came out on video and we gave this movie a second chance, which we rarely ever did with movies that didn't past our muster initially, we still couldn't get past a mere peak before laughter overtook us until we put something in more scary, like a Porky Pig cartoon. This movie ranks not only as one of my all time worst horror movies ever seen, but time in my life I'll never get back after wasting it. This movie stinks. The fact if had sequels proves the P.T. Barnum quote of, \\"there's a sucker born every minute.

0060899220|5.0|Raw and Truthful, this is what Bourdain is all about.  As a reader of this book you too wil travel through the life of a chef, plus pick us some excellent advice in your daily life of culinary cusine, for example, stay away from fish on Sunday and Monday..because its not fresh or avoid those over priced brunch buffets, because just as we all may have suspected, it is the remains of last night dinner, with some eggs and cheese thrown in.  If you enjoy the show, no reservation and his total frankness, I suggest reading this book first, before reading a Cooks Tour.
0156027321|5.0|Being this one of my favorite books ever, and with 1700+ reviews written before mine, I will not dwell on the merits of this book and of its author. I would rather just observe that this, as many other masterpieces in the history of literature, has more than one level of reading. Judging on the reviews I read, many readers fail to catch the deepest level of lecture. People have celebrated Homer's \\"Odissey\\" as a classic for three thousand years because behind the history of a travel one can read about the soul of a man. This book is like the \\"Odissey\\". The reader may not realize it until the last few pages, where Martell has done a good job in simplifying the task, with a literary coup of genius.    This book has another great and little discussed merit. It is humble. No high-style narration and no high-tones comments. It flows humbly but it humbly sticks to the heart of the readers who appreciate its simple but touching message. Enjoy.
0743298020|5.0|I just read it over the weekend and loved it!  It's a wonderful story.  And just when you think you have it all figured out, you don't.  I love books that make you say, \\"Wow, really?\\"    Bravo, Ms. Setterfield!!
B0000DESLW|4.0|We all know that a diet high in sugar isn't good for us, but sometimes we all need to treat ourselves....just a little. That's where Wham's \\"The Final\\" CD comes in... Served up on this tiny silver platter is the perfect 80s pop binge, guaranteed to satisfy any sweet tooth without the bitter aftertaste of other artificial imitators ....cough, [[ASIN:B0002IQI8I Scissor Sisters]], cough.   Of course as a treat, this album is best reserved for those \\"special\\" occasions. What better soundtrack could there be to your next pool party than the inviting tomes of Club Tropicana, where \\"drinks are free\\" (I'll drink to that...where's the [[ASIN:B000AEZVRS Magic Bullet]]!) And don't forget your next [[ASIN:B0002W4P98 Office]] Christmas party, where with a spin of a disc you can remind the Ex who ditched you for your best mate, that you've also found someone \\"special\\" to give your heart to as you gaze lovingly into your best mates eyes.......sigh!  After such a glowing recommendation, why only 4 stars? you may well ask. The answer is simple really. The original LP release (in fact it was a 2 LP set, mmmmm nice) included the little remembered masterpiece, \\"blue, armed with love (studio version)\\" .....repeat the line \\"can't you see me falling apart\\" ad infinitum and you'll have a good idea of what you're missing. I'd desperately hoped this gem would find its way onto this release, but alas I'll need to hold onto my precious Japanese \\"Club Tropicana\\" CD single (I know you're jealous) if I want to have the complete collection. Curse the limitations of digital media. But wait you say, what if they had shaved off [[ASIN:B000008K0D Andrew Ridgeley's]] contribution to the album, just maybe there might have been enough room spare to fit the lost track back where it belongs. Checks disc.....Shock, horror, no need to toss the doe eyed pretty boy aside, because without any changes they could have fitted this track on the CD with room to spare! I think it's time fans burn't they're shuttlecocks in protest at such shabby treatment.
B0000062GK|5.0|Joe Satriani is really incredible, this album prove that he is one of the best guitar player, if not the best.  Yes, there are many incredible guitar players around, but Joe is without a doubt, in the top rated guitar player around the world.  Greatly done Joe !
6304806434|5.0|Women are not typically prone to watch a tough action movie like this one. But the strong silent type man character portrayed here with an adoring wife and child seems to bring out their empathy. My wife and I both love this movie. I originally rented it but after one viewing it was obvious it was a had to own. We have watched it numerous times since. Nicholas Cage is outstanding, but the rest of the cast lends such a wide array of talent that it gives that over the top action and fun that makes it stand above many others of this genre. I love John Cusack and his performance here is great. He is the Yang to Cage's Ying. With Cage being the tough hard hitter, Cusack adds enough comic relief to make the movie very palatable. Add in some unforgettable performances by John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Colm Meaney and you have a powerhouse. I highly recommend this one. If you enjoy it, be sure to catch \\"The Rock\\".
B000OQF6N6|3.0|Okay, first of all this is actually a pretty good album.  To be honest it is better than I expected!  So what's the problem you ask?  Why only three stars?  The problem is the fact that the Pumpkins were one of the best bands in the world for years, and like any band, they have to be compared to their back catalog.  Siamese dreams is one of the best albums ever with Melon Collie coming in a close second.  Hell, I would put pisces iscariot up against just about anything coming out today.  Simply put, this album just doesn't live up to just about everything else the Pumpkins have released.  It's unfortunate because if I had never heard them before I would consider this a great album.    Secondly, THIS IS NOT THE SMASHING PUMPKINS.  For all you who say that Billy and Jimmy were basically all that mattered in the pumpkins you are simply wrong.  Billy and Jimmy were ZWAN.  Anyone who has played in a band knows that everyone plays an integral part in the sound and song development.  Take anyone out and it's simply not the same.  This should have been considered the second ZWAN album.  In fact I would consider this an exceptional album in that case since it is far better than the \\"official\\" ZWAN album, and the songs here more closely resemble ZWAN than the Pumpkins.    Go ahead and bash me, but the best songs on Zeitgeist are just not as good as the worst on Gish, Siamese Dreams, Mellon Collie, Pisces iscariot, or Adore.  OK, maybe it's better than Machina I, but that's not saying much.  I will always love the Pumpkins and I will support anything Billy puts out no matter what he calls it, but this sounds like a mediocre Pumpkins cover band trying to write original material.  Of course this is just my opinion :)
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Excellent lead in to \\"Stone Cold\\". Tom Selleck does a great job as Stone in this prequel to the first movie. The back story of him being fired because he drank on the job shows he has a murky past. Him driving to Paradise, and us getting a chance to see character development, is good. He finds some suspicious events tied to the previous sheriff of Paradise, and a good lead as to why the sheriff is retiring early. When he handles a case of a battered wife, he finds the husband is hiding something. If that isn't enough, Jesse's dog Boomer has failing health. It is handled with a sensitive touch. Especially if you have been through it. If you enjoy this be sure to catch the other two movies \\"Stone Cold\\" and \\"Death in Paradise\\" based on Robert Parker books. You may like \\"An Innocent Man\\" as well. It is a drama with Selleck being falsely accused of a crime and then being sent to prison. Tom Selleck is a great actor. Often underappreciated as far as I'm concerned. I have enjoyed ninety percent of all his TV shows and movies. So if you like Selleck or good dramas, be sure to catch this one.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|...Because this album is about as self-indulgent and trite as it gets. I'm not bitching about D'Arcy and James' absence, I'm bitching about the uninspired lolly-godness and lack of energy and originality that Billy has put into the \\"smashing Pumpkins\\" music. I am perfectly ok with a human being believing what they want to believe, but it REALLY hurts the music when you make the music reflect your personal views only. I would not be surprised if James and D'Arcy decided to not be a part of this by choice. Obviously Jimmy Chamberlin shares the same point of views on religion/the world as Billy. Good for him. I miss when Billy sang about fantastic characters, creatures, and other fairy-tale oriented fantasy elements. I miss even more when he sang about love, not love of god, but humanistic love in general that I could relate to. I am fine with change and have enjoyed the changes from most of the bands I've always cherished, but the Smashing Pumpkins are void of what made them so wonderful to me. Not suprisingly, the music on this album is great, fun rock. Unfortunately, the opinionated/political subject matter completely detracts from the beauty of the music and as a whole falls short. That, and for the first time ever Billy's vocals are grating and odd in a not so good way. Hard to describe. I cannot express my disappointment enough, as I have loved everything from Gish to Machina. But, I'm not going to carry on about it. The Smashing Pumpkins dont exist to please me. Its Billy's baby and I understand that. I was just shocked at how unappealing this record was. This is more Zwan/Corgan solo than Smashing Pumpkins. I'd say the better buy of today is Bad Religion's new album, \\"New Maps Of Hell\\", which is less \\"See the light\\" and more of what the world really needs: \\"TRUTH\\".<br /><br />Sorry if this wasnt helpful. Rate it as such
B00005RDRO|4.0|Great cast and funny dialogue make this movie a treat. I chuckled throughout the movie because of the funny lines. Listen carefully and you won't be disappointed. Fans of \\"Clue\\" should enjoy it. The story is rather predictable based on previous movies like \\"And Then There Were None\\", but that is part of the point to be predictable, it is the Neil Simon dialogue full of puns that is the real treat.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|\\"After the Wedding\\" could be the best film I've seen in a decade.<br /><br />And I say that even though I didn't see all of it --- like just about everyone else in that theater, for the entire last half hour I was afflicted by a bout of silent sobbing that wouldn't quit.<br /><br />I cherish that amazing, unforgettable experience: several hundred people weeping together.<br /><br />And then --- I'm not spoiling the movie here --- came a \\"happy ending\\" that is perhaps the most satisfying conclusion of any film I've seen in a decade.<br /><br />Satisfying because the characters earned it. There was a huge price for each of them to pay, and they stepped up to it. They earned the right to better. And, because you have lived their struggles with them, you leave the movie with the kind of satisfaction that no studio-financed, movie-by-committee-and-focus-group can give you.<br /><br />And the punch line of all this praise?<br /><br />The story is pure soap opera. Really. On a low budget, with no-name actors and maybe even this script, \\"After the Wedding\\" would be right at home on Lifetime.<br /><br />Consider the plot. Jacob, a Dane in his 30s, works in an orphanage in India. He hasn't been home in 20 years, and that's just fine with him. Bad news: The orphanage is running out of money. Good news: Jørgen, a philanthropist, wants to write the large check that will save it. On one condition: He wants to meet the recipient. The woman who runs the orphanage can't go. Well, Jørgen is Danish, Jacob is Danish. Jacob should go.<br /><br />Reluctantly, Jacob flies to Denmark. Jørgen listens to his pitch for only a few minutes before seeming to lose interest --- it's the weekend of his daughter's wedding. To which Jacob should come. It's not, after all, like he has anything else to do.<br /><br />At the wedding, the first surprise: Helene, Jørgen's wife, was once Jacob's lover. In fact, she was the lover who broke his heart. The lover who sent him scurrying off to India, an orphan hiding among orphans.<br /><br />Other surprises: I'll spare you. And encourage you to read not a word more about the story --- let the twists and turns sear you as they roll out. But I'll go this far: The rich and poor, the white and the colored, Europeans and Indians --- the moral lessons are so easy, aren't they? Or are they? Is Jacob's moral purity really an emblem of superiority? Is Jørgen's privileged life a sign of a rotting soul? You'll judge --- you can't help it --- but when it's over....<br /><br />When it's over, you'll want to thank director Susanne Bier, a Danish filmmaker whose last film, \\"Brothers\\", is also a memorably wrenching drama. Mads Mikkelsen --- who plays Jacob (and was the villain in \\"Casino Royale\\") --- will make you forget all other young actors; he's not only shockingly handsome, he can make reticence and distance both intimate and compelling. And Jørgen, played by Rolf Lassgård --- when the film ends, you'll find yourself replaying his performance to take note of all that you missed. And was there ever a trophy wife as radiant, loving and thoughtful as Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen)?<br /><br />\\"After the Wedding\\" was Denmark's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2007 Academy Awards. It lost to the German film, \\"The Lives of Others.\\" I would have voted differently.<br /><br />There are DVDs you rent from Netflix. You watch them, you send them back; you got the amusement you paid for. But sometimes, very rarely, there are DVDs you buy. You buy them because you think they define a time in your life. Or because you think you'll want to watch them again. Or --- as is the case here --- because you want to press the film on someone you love and say, \\"Here. This. A life-changer.\\"<br /><br />\\"After the Wedding\\" took me to places I didn't know I could go to. To places I didn't know I could handle. In fact, I could. My bet is that you can, too.ourage you to read not a word more about the story --- let the twists and turns sear you as they roll out.

B000P0J024|5.0|There are many bands that tout themselves as super groups, but The Traveling Wilburys are one that actually lives up to the billing.  George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison originally got together to cut a song for a b-side to the \\"This Is Love\\" single off George Harrison's 1987 comeback album Cloud Nine. The song was \\"Handle With Care\\" and it was deemed to good to be just a b-side (\\"Breath Away From Heaven\\" ended up as the \\"This Is Love\\" b-side), so they decided to record a whole album to go along with the song.  The resulting Volume I released in late 1988 is a fabulous collection of songs that contain some beautiful harmonies, flawless production and some sharp and witty writing. The guys are clearly having fun even going so far as to take on Wilbury pseudonyms (which for some reason were changed for the next album) and include a history of the band. Due to the sudden death of Mr. Orbison shortly after the album's release, a potential tour was scraped and it looked like the Wilburys would be a one time affair.  But the group got back together for 1990's wryly titled Vol. 3.  Though not as tight as Volume I, it offers many of same pleasures and has aged well over the years.  The deluxe package combines both albums and a dvd and brings back these long out of print albums.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The images and commentary on this DVD set are all outstanding! I'm typically not one to sit down and watch nature documentaries on a regular basis, but when I first got the DVD, we watched an episode every few nights. I've seen a few of the episodes more than once now and find something new each time.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|So after Zwan and Billy's Solo album, thefutureembrace, we are given the return of the smashing pumpkins.  Would it fall to the same problems of those two albums?  Not really, though there are problems.  First the good however.  This album rocks.  Doomsday Clock reminds me of the harsh distortion of Gish, while Tarantula is as catchy as anything the smashing pumpkins ever did.  Bleed the orchid is a great song, with that dreamy sound we loved on Siamese Dream.  And while the album is excellent, I can't escape the feeling of over effort.  It's almost as if Billy Corgan was afraid of another flop, and worked over and over again to make an album smashing pumpkin fans of old would like. That effort is effected by the pointlessly political songs.  His straining voice doesn't help us forget this is a Pumkins album seven years later.  Little quibbles aside, I love this album, and have listened to it far more than to some of the other albums I've been buying lately.  If you are a Smashing Pumpkin fan, you will find plenty to enjoy.  Give it a listen.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was 15 years old when the Beatles hit. I have been a super fan from the start.<br /><br />These tracks are superior in their quality and you can hear the harmonies better in both the vocals and instrumentation.<br /><br />In many tracks the music is interwoven with music from other Beatles songs, making them..in my opinion..better. George Martin should definetly go into the vault and do more of the same. I am hearing things I have never heard before. Strawberryfields was terrific. This CD is a must have.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Simply put: everyone is at the top of their game...  Fincher, Downey, the writer, the cinematographer.  It felt like i was watching one of the great films of the seventies.  Sadly underachieved in theatrical release.  Don't miss it on dvd.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|I really wanted to love this cd but once again it's \\"Megadeth Lite.\\"  Dee Dee, Dunk, Dee Dee Dee, Dunk Dunk.  Dave's rythms are absolutely boring.  I only got thru about five songs - tell me the good stuff is to come.  I am a huge M fan but for several cds Dave seems obssesed with just singing and singing and singing.  Meanwhile, the guitar just drones on and on and on.  The rythm guitar is just lame.  M has turned into melodic metal; a power metal band.  He repeats himself over and over again in his vocals.  For the past several cds the songs just sound the same over and over again.  There is no FIRE.  And we want it so badly we keep coming back.  The M we love made their point with lyrics and then put there heads down and PLAYED.  Dave, I have complete respect for you - but write a book!  You have all these things you want to say and they need to be heard but not with kick A$$ metal!  You are so busy getting your point across there is no MUSIC.  Say what you have to say and then let the band pound!!!  There is no urgency to this music, no BALLS.  I am not a musician but it just sounds like the same old boring thing M has been putting out - one Bridge after another.  This is NOT heavy metal; it's melodic metal M unfortunately has been offering for some time.  It's like Dave is just very tired.  And I hate to write this review.    ok, here (hear) is a followup because one dude really jumped my case on this one.  No problem; I welcome the input.  And, it stinks to have a great band go average.  Stop - I'm kidding!  However, if anyone thinks this is great metal please do this for me - listen to the following three cds and when you have finished listen to this cd and tell me how great it is.  Please listen to the following (if you can listen to these three and still think that this offering from megadeth is good; well; ok):    1.  Toxik - World Circus  2.  Las Cruces - Ringmaster  3.  Cirith Ungol (I'm going way back on this one) - King of the Dead

B000N3T0DW|5.0|Volver is extremely well done. It is an exploration of the world of women; a world that Almodovar has demonstrated he can represent as few artists have done before. There are few men in this film and those that are present are soon gone, leaving us with a film about the vast complexity of human relationships, especially relationships between women. I rank this film equal to \\"All About My Mother\\" and \\"Talk to Her\\", two other Almodovar masterpieces.    When viewing an Almodovar film, you feel that there is exploration taking place, that the director and actors may go in places that no one expects. The viewer can feel the force of creativity in his films because they hint at multiple plot directions and character development possibilities. This is so very different from highly polished, highly producted, highly directed American action films that have been developed and charted out to the last minute detail before the cameras start to film. These slick constructs are impressive but Almodovar is an artist of the possible, the random, the spontaneous and unexpected change in direction.     The cast is superb with the only possible drawback being that all the actresses in the film look like normal everyday women with the exception of Penelope Cruz, playing the lead role of Raimunda. Cruz's beauty is breath-taking, reminding me of rare beauty of Elizabeth Taylor in the 1950s.    I loved the plot, full of wierd twists and coincidences. I loved the women, living in the special world of empathy, love, wisdom, and emotional support that women are able to create. Almodovar pays a tribute to the feminine in his films for he understands the vast and endless possibilities of the female heart.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I have heard about this movie for years, finally watched it - wow, gives a good idea what the depression was like here in Oklahoma.  Great Movie!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I have never heard such beautiful harmony and vocals! The music was just wonderful! The orchestra was outstanding! I have already decided that \\"The Prayer\\" is going to be sung at my wedding. I can't help but cry every time I hear that song sung by Chloe (I have already bought the sheet music for it:))There were a couple of songs that got a little boring but for the most part it was GREAT!!! The DVD is magnificent as well! It has about 6 or 7 more songs.

B000002UAU|1.0|Sounds worn and dated.  Sounded good maybe when you were on drugs in the sixties but now, it's drek.
B000P2A24W|4.0|Love many of the songs. I personally prefer the first half of the album to the second half. I feel the song choices are better in the first half, but that doesn't mean that after listen to the album a few more times I won't like the second half just as much. The first half just seems to have songs that linger in my memory well after listen to the cd. Especially love Lost Highway, Make A Memory and We Got It Going On.     Make a Memory is a slow song, similar to All About Loving You from the Bounce album or Always (not to be put in the same basket as Always though). Its a slow, teary song which pulls at the heart string.    We Got It Going On, reminds me of I'll Sleep When I'm Dead. Its upbeat, fun and full of energy! Great song... fun to sing along to in the car!     Lost Highway brings a bit of a country feel, but still keeps with their rock and roll roots.    Some of the songs sounds similar to those on previous BJ and JBJ's solo albums, however this isn't such a bad thing. It looks like they realised what worked and reused those pieces on this album with similar sounds and vocals.    Overall I love this album and am happy I purchased it. If your an old fan who loves the hard rock from way back you may be disappointed because this album doesn't go back there.
B000HIVO64|3.0|As with most Beck records, I'm not in love with every track, but I would have sex with most of his songs.<br /> On The Information, I found only a couple of songs that I felt like Beck was being Beck. There is alot to catch your ear, but not enough for the ear to stay and have breakfast in the morning.<br /> That being said, it's not a bad record. If you are a Beck fan, you already know that.

0307346609|1.0|You hunker down, shaking and in a cold sweat, deep underground, your face lit only by the flickering luminesence of the CRT screen. Reports from your Team---dispatches from the few field soldiers left in the locked-down bioweapons complex, miles beneath an irradiated surface overrun by the flesh-hungry Living Dead---look grim.<br /><br />The news is not good. The Main Level Hatch was somehow breached hours ago. Sector 13 is totally overrun, Lab Level contaminated, the infected eggheads now hungry for a different sort of brains. Doc Lavinov said the Dead can't crawl, but judging from the video-feeds coming from the air-duct security cams---well, looks like Doc was wrong.<br /><br />They're coming through the big air vents. They're almost here. Soon you will be faced with an impossible mission.<br /><br />What is it, you ask? Will you have to crawl 30 stories up an active nuclear silo & squeeze yourself into the command gantry, to launch a final strike against the Zombie plague from Hell's dark heart?<br /><br />Will you have to race against time to concoct a zombie anti-virus? Design a special napalm launcher to burn your way to the surface? Hotwire a VTOL super-jet? Fake the zombies out?<br /><br />NEGATIVE, soldier! None of the above! Your Mission Impossible: write a book that will make Humanity's War against the Zombie Menace staggering, mind-blastingly DULL. Dull as a turnip!<br /><br />Sounds impossible, yes? I don't think so, soldier!---Max Brooks, son of Mel & author of the reasonably amusing \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\", has done just that.<br /><br />Brooks cooks up \\"Z\\" as a firsthand account of the Zombie plague as it boils up out of China to ravage the world, related through a series of post-war interviews with the War's survivors: military techs from Russia, naval officers aboard a rogue Chinese nuclear submarine, a dastardly biotech billionaire, the former Vice President of the US, the Chinese doctor who examined the elusive \\"Patient Zero\\"---and so forth.<br /><br />Sounds interesting & novel, right? Wrong. Dead wrong. Max Brooks's \\"World War Z\\" boasts the dubious distinction of turning the end of the World as we know it into a really tedious read.<br /><br />Really, if you want to know what reading \\"World War Z\\" is like, it's like filing your income tax return, eating Lima Bean & Mayonnaise Casserole, winning a 40 dollar shopping spree at a dollar store, and playing your great-grandfather consecutive games of checkers for a three-week jag, all at the same time. I would rather sever my own arm and eat it raw than ever read this book again.<br /><br />It's not hard to figure out what went wrong here:<br /><br />1) Interviews aren't exciting. They're post-war, which pretty much kills the apocalyptic fear-factor girding the loins of most flesh-eater romps. If somebody (boring) is talking to a (boring) interviewer, then we made it. We survived.<br /><br />Go team. Knowing we made it---well, how would \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" have played if the flick started out with Ben and Barbara yakking it up about their 'close shave' from their timeshare in Rio?<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />2) Brooks simply isn't able to create vivid, distinct, living, breathing characters. Result: every interview sounds the same. Same 'voice', same slang, whether you're talking to a Valley Girl or a Chinese nuclear scientist.<br /><br />3) Worse still, Brooks just can't write: I mentioned that all the character voices sound the same. That's true, but it gets worse: they're all voiced by---well, let's just call him Mr. Bland. Mr. Bland is front-&-center on every page of World War Z.<br /><br />If you dig the level of writing you find on the back of a pillbox or in a late-night real estate infomercial, you'll dig Mr. Bland. Hey, World War Z might be the book for you!<br /><br />Worse, Brooks hasn't bothered to do the minimal background research (not into the Living Dead, silly---they don't exist---I'm talking geography, military tactics, the works),and that further strains the narrative. Suspension of Disbelief I can dig. Brooks asks you to launch your Disbelief into Orbit.<br /><br />Case in point: the Battle of Yonkers, where the US military is overrun by the Living Dead. Why? Because the brass fights the thing like it was the set-piece from Day the Earth Stood Still. By piling everything---armor, artillery, hovercraft, jarheads, the works, baby---into one alley in Yonkers and waiting for the zombies to eat everybody. Oh, and they also decide this one single battle is gonna be it, because hey, why worry about having a backup plan.<br /><br />Oh, and they forget to bring enough ammunition. Seriously.The US army getting caught off guard and overrun by running zombies? That I can see. The US military getting chomped by critters that a 98-year old palsy victim with a decent walker could outrun?  I don't think so.<br /><br />Anyway, the Hell of it is that the 'War' is all wrapped up about 1/3rd of the way through; the rest is a sort of post-apocalypse walk through the nifty big government \\"New Deal\\" style social programs the survivors set up afterwards. If you're the kind of person who digs on crop reports and reading the minutes of the local Daughters of the Revolution Knitting Society, you'll probably find this stuff lively & engaging.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a baked potato, or find yourself saying things like \\"gosh, I think it's time to re-read 'Farmers Almanac 1997 again', you might enjoy this book.<br /><br />Otherwise avoid, unless you're really looking for a novel way to get your Z's---and I'm not talking about the undead kind.<br /><br />JSGbit.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|Upon listening to the live stream promo release of the Smashing Pumpkins new album Zeitgeist, I wasn't very impressed.  The definitive Pumpkins sound was in there somewhere, but I thought it was lost in the mix somehow.  The vocals were too sharp and high in the mix and the layered vocals bordered on ridiculous in songs like Starz.  Moreover, Jimmy Chamberlin's excellent drumming was buried in some parts.  Perhaps working with Roy Thomas Baker (producer for Queen, The Cars...) was a mistake?  Maybe recording the album with Butch Vig (Nevermind, Siamese Dream) would have been a better idea, to help recapture the magic of old?    Tonight I received an email telling me I could download my pre-order of Zeitgeist through iTunes (normally I don't buy lossy music but I wanted the code for advance concert ticket orders).  After loading it into my iPod I settled in to give the album a proper listen and decide whether my original impression of the album would stand.    Firstly, the album version sounds much better than the internet streams and leaks.  Anyone who steals this album and thinks is sounds bad needs to take a listen from a CD or official source.  It is amazing how much worse a badly compressed file can sound.  If the iTunes version sounds this good, then I am getting the CD ASAP to see if it is even better.  The production is very clean, and while I would still have liked the vocals to be mixed slightly lower, I feel that I can live with them as the guitars now hold their own and the drums are solid.  The album doesn't sound like any other Pumpkins record so comparisons can be thrown out the window but dark and sultry are the closest adjectives I can find to describe the production.    Upon pressing play, the album launches into overdrive with tracks, Doomsday Clock and 7 Shades of Black.  The buzzing drone of Doomsday Clock channels a more radio friendly version of Bodies from MCIS, and 7 Shades recalls the track Dross from the group's free internet release Machina II, with a little bit of Geek USA and Sabbath thrown in for good measure.  Unfortunately, missing is the fast/slow dynamic of earlier Pumpkins songs.  Still, very solid tracks.    Bleeding the Orchid is a dark, undulating track that continues the dark tone of the album, and sounds like a long lost b-side from Gish.  This track is the first to make apparent the trend of vocal layering used throughout the album, for good or bad.    In a wash of warm faded guitars, Thats the Way (My Love Is) reminds of a Zwan take on Stand Inside Your Love.  \\"Of course I love you baby/'cause i'm alive\\" sings Billy, and one can't help but wonder if he is speaking to former lover Courtney Love.    Before listening to Tarantula, it is apparent that the lyrics of Zeitgeist are pseudo-political  from lines like \\"in whitewashed halls/their jackals lick their paws...\\", but after listening to Tarantula it becomes apparent what the title Zeitgeist (The Spirit of the times) means.    If the lyrics \\"don't let me say this/but you're no worse than me/its crazy/we are the real/if real ever was/and just because/we are the real/they feel we have enough\\" aren't enough to interpret Billy's motives, the not too subtle single cover with Paris Hilton standing in front of a mushroom cloud with a Blackberry in hand completely gives them away.  The concept of the album centers around America's apathy and languorous attitude concerning the political and social climate produced by our leaders and felt by people around the world.  Indeed, the climate of bloggers and MySpace has led to a public more interested in Britney's Spears' haircut than more serious subjects.  Although Billy admits, Paris and his listeners are no worse than him, as we are all \\"Starz\\".  Someone, (the internet, paparazzi, corporations?) gave us sound.  Starz is a repetitive, David Bowie/Ziggy Stardust homage with more vocal layering which reaffirms the earlier thematic elements discussed.    After Starz, the album reaches it's climax withthe rollicking 9:51 minute track United States.  This track is indulgent, but it is nevertheless impressive and obviously meant to be a live jam track with warbled guitars and Billy exclaiming \\"revolution!/what will they do to you?\\".    The bombastic United States is followed by a 1979 inspired track Neverlost with marimbas in the background.  Although many will skip this track while listening to the album, it is important because it sets the tone for the second half of the album which turns from dark and brooding to hopeful.  \\"Lets kill these hours/and fill desire\\" Billy croons in this love song.    Bring the Light, is the newest sounding song on the album, and although repetitive, it sounds like a radio single with its catchy lyrics and Brian May/Ava Adore guitar solo.    (Come On), Lets Go! is Pop-Grunge (oxymoron?) at its finest and is somehow eerily similar to Today.  Billy sings about escaping \\"c'mon lets go/beyond the great unknown/beyond their punched-up skulls/to die upon this road\\".  C'mon Billy, any Grunge fan knows it's not a great unknown it's a \\"Superunknown\\".    The final two songs sound very much out of place.  Billy slips back into dark and brooding mode with \\"God and Country\\" which sounds like a b-side from Adore or Machina with its synth-pop mechanics.  However, it would never fit on those albums with its political message.    Pomp and Circumstance is difficult to describe but if you have seen movies like 1492: Conquest of Paradise, or other period exploration movies you will recognize the influence.  The Tribal Island sounds remind of perhaps The Thin Red Line?  The song is hopeful.  So thematically, it fits the arch of sounds Billy has created, but still somehow it still doesn't seem to fit.    Zeitgeist judged against other Pumpkins works isn't their best and isn't their worst.  As noted in many web forums, Jame Iha and D'arcy Wretsky had very little to do with the recording of the classic Pumpkins records so it is difficult to say if their influence is missed here.    The Smashing Pumpkins are an ever changing sound imagined by Billy Corgan and made possible by the remarkable rhythms produced by Jimmy Chamberlin.  Each Pumpkins album is different and meant to be appreciated on its own, and on its own Zeitgeist is great.  Highlights for me are:  7 Shades, Bring the Light, Tarantula, Starz, Bleeding the Orchid, and (Come On).
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Mastodon is truly an amazing band. Loaded with talent, from the crushing, pulse pounding of the seemingly endless drum fills to the crisp, melodic chant of the guitars, it's obvious this isn't your everyday band. And they aren't by any means. The best thing about Mastodon is the way in which they almost seem to transend genres. They hit on several levels which makes them a fantastic listen. Remission was a great show of power on their part. Loaded with more instrumental work than vocals it was incredibly well done.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|If this is a sign of the times... hopefully the times are almost over. All the songs sound the same. They all sound like someone trying to save his career by copying himself. It's too bad they couldn't reunite for real. This is not the same Smashing Pumpkins who made great music throughout the 90s and constantly found new ways to reinvent themselves and their sound. That band broke up in 2000. Sadly, people seem to be willing to trick themselves that it is. That band is long gone. I so wanted it to be and was really excited when I heard about the 'reunion'. That would be nice if they would reunite for real though. Down-tuned fuzzy guitars and smacking the Pumpkins name on it does not a reunion make. This is trickery designed fool people who have been waiting for this band to come back for the better part of a decade. Minus this neat trick it could be any other billy corgan side project. Don't be fooled. (Lest we forget.. Jimmy wasn't even part of the original three-piece with drum-machine trio that was the original line-up. So technically there is only one original member left who hired new members and called it reunion.) Chamberlain might as well be a session drummer who will add drum tracks to anything Billy does-like Billy's side projects which is basically what this is he's just decided to put the pumpkins name on it and fake the rest. This is already the most unfortunate disappointment of 2007. For pumpkins fans anyways. For people who have been fans of the band that was I highly do not recommend this. But those of you who like to have make believe...you might just be able to fool yourself into thinking its the real deal.
0451207521|2.0|I am usually a big fan of Ken Follett, but Jackdaws just doesn't measure up to what we have come to expect from him.  It's really too bad, because the premise--an all-female commando unit operating behind Nazi lines--is great.  And the story has a basis in fact, as the afterward explains.  So, the scene is set for a terrifc read, but this time Follet doesn't deliver.    The characters are thin and one-dimensional, even the lead.  Follet spends very little energy demonstrating the motivation of the generally rag-tag recruits to undertake a critical and deadly assignment.  The love interest subplot is forced and unconvincing.  But most of all, the darn thing just isn't well written.  Follet commits the amateurish literary sin of \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing\\"; that makes for easier writing, I guess, but it short-changes the reader.  Characters do not just have emotional reactions, they announce their emotions, as if we wouldn't understand them otherwise.  And the dialog rarely sounds natural.    This is not a terrible book.  Ken Follet is incapable of that, even on a bad day.  But there are many other books by the same author that you will find more rewarding.   If you are in the mood for a action-oriented novel in a historical setting, look to his other novels.
B000BKDOB6|5.0|Patti is an inspiration and my goddess. Still going strong at 60 years old, the live album alone is reason to buy this. Patti conjures such amazing, shamanic energy in her performance of the songs. I find myself listening to this album much, much more often than to the 1975 studio version. Her voice is stronger, the band is tighter, and she's older and wiser - but still just as intense, and still an important artist. HIGHLY recommended!
B000OQF6N6|2.0|I admit it, I fell for the hype.  I loved Smashing Pumpkins in the early to mid 90's but didn't really follow them after Mellon Collie.  They were an essential part of my late teenage years and Siamese Dream is my favorite album of there's.  So in comparison with those works, no this doesn't even come close.  As has already been mentioned, the songwriting and riffs are just nothing to write home about, and the vocals are oftentimes like nails on a chalkboard.  Something about the way they were mixed is just irritating, and doesn't sit well in the overall mix.  Yes they have proved they can still rock, and it's still better then a lot of the garbage out today, but knowing what the Pumpkins are capable of just puts this album way behind many of their works.
B000286RNY|5.0|This movie was my first experience with Stephen Chow. Wow - is he ever funny! Very inventive & creative & original. This flick is extremely wild & has non-stop laughs the whole way through. The \\"assembling the samurai\\" sequence was especially hilarious. See this film if you want an excellently silly comic experience.

A must-read for all you out there that want to communicate and understand your loved ones better.
0553213105|4.0|I read the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. This book dragged on and on in the middle and it is not an easy read due to the language of the time. But it's a fun, character-driven novel. My favorite character was the father - he's a riot! Don't expect much to happen, but there's a lot going on. For example, it's an interesting study of British class differences at the turn of the century. Also, the options women had were much more limited than today and it made for very different relationship dynamics.
B000PY52EU|4.0|Craig Brewer's Deep South gothic, `Black Snake Moan' is both an intriguing and raw study in contrasts that go beyond the color of skin. Christina Ricci's plays the troubled Rae, a young white-trash girl whose persona is one of booze, drugs, illicit sex. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves for the Army, Rae jumps at the opportunity to have sex with the town's drug dealer. Later, after a party filled with drugs, alcohol, naked football, and sex with various participants, Rae gets a ride, and a serious beating, by Ronnie's friend Gil (Michael Raymond-James). She is found the next day by Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), an old farmer and blues player who just found out his wife has left him for his younger brother. A spiritual man with a heavy heart, he takes in the young Rae and, after cleaning and bandaging her wounds, he soon discovers Rae's nymphet ways though the small town chatter mill. Lazarus' budding relationship with a drug store pharmacist Angela (S. Epatha Merkerson of `Law & Order' fame) is then tested when she discovers Rae is associated with him. A twisted character study soon begins to intertwine within itself.<br /><br />Chris Brewer's script is both sensationally direct and very visually appealing. His uses of un-Hollywood camera angles only add to the appeal. Christina Ricci's acting is impressive while Samuel L. Jackson's character is revealing throughout the movie. Both John Cothran and Justin Timberlake play convincing and believable parts. Co-Producer John Singleton made a good choice in associating himself with this endeavor.<br /><br /> `Black Snake Moan' is neither a porno (although there is nudity)nor a racist expose. In fact, `Black Snake Moan' is a show of contrasts; of lifestyles, age, color, sex, and direction. All coming to collision at the end where everyone learns while there are differences, the roads in life are all too familiar.<br /><br />This movie is a Buy!
630522577X|3.0|Loved the lipstick; hated the pig.<br /><br />\\"My Fair Lady\\" is an elaborate wedding cake; it offers all the rewards and punishments of that overblown confection. The opening credits alone stuff you till you can't move: under white titles, lush, buttercream peonies, daisies and carnations lounge as if they were odalisques in a harem. You just want to bury your face in their petals and drown in scent.<br /><br />And then, after he's proved he can wow you with white alone, Academy Award winning director George Cukor pops your eyes: a magenta gown and exotic, feathered headdress bedeck a woman descending a stair. She and the vintage luxury car she enters, before driving out of the movie forever, are onscreen for mere seconds.<br /><br />No top hat is without its luster; no cobblestone lane without the dawn- or dusk- echoing heelstrike of a lovelorn swain.<br /><br />The elaborate gold wallpaper in Higgins' home writhes like some Edwardian opium eater's hallucination. This is juxtaposed with grey housekeeper Mrs. Pearce's (Mona Washbourne) bosomy officiousness. The Ascot scene juxtaposes hysterical lyrics -- \\"Pulses rushing! Faces flushing! Heartbeats speed up! I have never been so keyed up!\\" with the funniest parody of British stiff upper lips. And the Transylvanian Queen is played by a real Baroness, Bina Rothschild.<br /><br />The songs exemplify the best of Broadway: \\"Wouldn't it be Loverly?\\" \\"The Street Where You Live,\\" \\"I Could have Danced All Night,\\" \\"The Rain in Spain,\\" \\"I've grown Accustomed to Her Face.\\"<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is as close to a fairy princess as any star who's graced us. She is beautiful and she's got soul and intelligence to burn. The attention she brings to one small scene -- she asks Freddy's mother to compensate her for Freddy's having trod on her violets -- her body performs a little ballet; her face broadcasts exactly who Eliza Doolittle is -- a girl of poverty, decency, ambition, and wit -- set the screen a-sparkle.<br /><br />\\"Sexy Rexy\\" earned his nickname by running through women like I run through kitchen sponges; there were two suicides. Harrison *is* Higgins (In the same way that he was also Captain Gregg, King Mongkut,  Julius Cesar and Pope Julius. He really owned these roles.) Harrison is entirely believable, even though his performance is stagey, larger than life, and his dialogue frequently over-the-top.<br /><br />\\"My Fair Lady\\" was based on George Bernard Shaw's \\"Pygmalion,\\" which took its title from a sublime Greek myth. Sculptor, and misogynist, Pygmalion sees no need for a woman in his life. Perhaps thanks to unconscious motivation, he carves a woman: Galatea. Over time, the proud bachelor metamorphosizes into a humble supplicant. Please, he begs of love goddess Aphrodite, grant me this one boon: allow my Galatea to come to life; allow me to love her. Just as his hard arrogance melts, and he resurrects to a new life of love, Galatea's marble melts, and she lives to love her Pygmalion.<br /><br />Shaw appropriated the title, but he violated the myth, perhaps in self-exculpation. Shaw was excessively attached to his mother; he never had sex with his wife, and he threatened his mistresses. Shaw didn't allow *his* creation, Higgins, to overcome his problem with women, to experience on the page or the stage what eluded arrogant Shaw in life.<br /><br />One definition of \\"main character\\": it's the character who changes. The title of this myth is \\"Pygmalion,\\" the name of the sculptor. It's *his* journey that has made this tale poignant to two plus millennia of fans. Where there is life, there is change. Death rejects change. Shaw's Pygmalion, Higgins, may as well be dead.<br /><br />It is a convention of Romantic movies that the lead couple \\"meet cute.\\" They do, in \\"My Fair Lady.\\" Language scholar Henry Higgins is about to travel to India to meet scholar Colonel Pickering, and Colonel Pickering is traveling to India to meet Higgins. In London, they have a star-crossed meeting.<br /><br/>Higgins' eyes twinkle when he looks at Pickering. He is endlessly affectionate to, appreciative of, and polite with Colonel Pickering.<br /><br />Eliza? Higgins treats her, from start to finish, with utter contempt, and more than a little softcore S&M. He denies her food. He shoves marbles into her mouth and forces her to attempt to recite. She struggles; she can't; she swallows a marble. Higgins shoves more in her. Ha, ha, ha. There are websites that cater to this sort of kink. Higgins, in a very grim scene, calls Eliza an \\"insect,\\" a \\"creature.\\" By the end of the movie, when Eliza is in Higgins' presence, she keeps silent till spoken to, and looks at the floor. And he looks, not only old enough to be her father, but perhaps her grandfather.<br /><br />When Eliza makes her two breakthroughs -- the \\"Rain in Spain\\" scene and the \\"Embassy ball\\" scene, Higgins doesn't so much as look at Eliza; he celebrates passionately with -- Pickering. Higgins doesn't say, \\"I think *you've* got it\\" to Eliza, he says, \\"I think *she's* got it\\" to Pickering.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|The band is back and still rocking hard.<br /><br />I've been a Pumpkins fan since '99 (when I was only 13 years old) and I quickly fell in love with their beautiful melodies and song structure. I became an instant fan.<br /><br />Ever since their reunion I watched every live vid I could of them, and I was throughly impressed. I was excited. I anticipated the release just as much as the next Pumpkins fan but unfortunately that live energy is just not captured here.<br /><br />The album has its high moments, but the feeling I get after listening through it is \\"stale, unresponsive, icky, bland\\". There's hardly a hook to be found on here (which was what made the pumpkins, the Pumpkins). The vocal cascades are reminiscent of Zwan (which I didn't care too much for admittedly, aside from their live performances).<br /><br />Though severely better than Machina, I'm still rather disappointed in this release. Where's the great guitar solos? Tarantula and Starz are the only two songs I found that have guitar solos. I guess if I had to compare this album to other releases, it would be a great big mess of TheFutureEmbrace, Mary Star of the Sea, and the second disc of Mellon Collie (which was the worse of the two, in my opinion).<br /><br />I'm sure Pumpkins-lovers will hate my review and bash me with negative marks, but let's be honest here. Billy and Jimmy aren't perfect, never have been (though I have doubted that with the melodic moments of Siamese Dream), but they really could have done much better here. If they claimed they were \\"back\\", they probably should have studied their old formulas better instead of letting their \\"newness\\" guide them.<br /><br />All in all, it's an okay album, but it leaves you feeling stale and not unlike an empty rattling pop can.<br /><br />Highlights are \\"Doomsday Clock\\", \\"Bleeding the Orchid\\", \\"That's The Way\\", \\"Tarantula\\", \\"Starz\\", and \\"Come On (Let's Go)\\". The rest I could do without, unfortunately!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
0312323867|4.0|Emily Giffin's second book is related to her previous one - in \\"Something Blue\\", she picks up the threads left by \\"Something Borrowed\\", and continues the story - only from the point of view of another character, \\"Something Borrowed\\"'s \\"bad guy\\" Darcy Rhone.<br /><br />While I was expecting from the description in Amazon for the book to reflect the events of the first book from Darcy's point of view, this is in fact a sequel. While we do get Darcy's rehash of what has been going on throughout the summer, we quickly move forward in the plot to see how Darcy is dealing with the situation.<br /><br />While fascinating & original as a sequel, the book suffers from a problem that plagues many other chick lit books - the change in the heroine just happens too quickly. One comment from Ethan is enough for Darcy to try and change her ways, and one mistake is all she makes along the road of learning of how to become a better person...<br /><br />This is still a fun book to read, and gives us a better look at the characters we've grown to like in \\"Something Borrowed\\".
B000KFTWIG|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1994 debut arrived at a turning point for hip hop music. As the old school style from the east coast was slowly growing stale, a new funkier and angrier approach was steadily growing in the form of gangsta rap from the west coast. Then, of course, came \\"Ready to Die,\\" one of the finest hip hop albums of all time, and one that bridged the gap between the old and new schools. This is the album that introduced the world to the incredible rapper and incredible character that was Christopher Wallace. A young, overweight Brooklyn native, a father, and a former hustler, Biggie impressed listeners not only with his talent but his personality on the mic. Technically, he is not short of amazing. His ingenious punchlines, late-night stories, threats, and jokes are delivered in his raspy, cheeky voice with precise technique, always on time and in a perfect flow. Lyrically, he covers many topics but the quality is ever so consistent. On one song, he'll be telling a story of crime, on the next song he'll be poking fun at a ghetto loser, or seducing a woman, nostalgically reminiscing over the past, or dramatically philosophizing about the meaning of life and death. His verses are all meticulously written and never lose your attention. Another reason \\"Ready to Die\\" is so great is the production. The young Sean Combs anchors a production team that uses extensive, clever sampling to create a unique musical backdrop for Biggie. The album is well divided between radio friendly singles and harder, darker songs that would be too rough for radio. The hardcore tracks inspired an entire generation of grimy New York rappers that would reign towards the late 1990s, but the influence of the popular singles could also be felt on urban radio for years to come. \\"Ready to Die\\" is an absolutely classic hip hop album and one of the finest ever, a must have for any collection.<br /><br />The album begins with a dramatic intro, which gives way to \\"Things Done Changed,\\" a well-produced and ironic look back at Biggie's humble roots. \\"Gimme the Loot\\" is one of the songs that shows his lyrical genius, where he plays multiple characters in a conversation, creating a classic track. \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" is an upbeat, funky cut sampling a song by Lords of the Underground for the hook. On the excellent \\"Warning,\\" Biggie again plays multiple characters during conversation, before dropping philosophy on backstabbers and issuing threats. The title track follows accordingly, as does the original mix of \\"One More Chance,\\" a song to a woman about their relationship (the more popular remix is not included on the tracklist). Perhaps my favorite song is the Method Man collaboration \\"The What,\\" a song where the two depressed MCs drop some dark knowledge and philosophy over a great beat. It doesn't get much better than having two of New York's finest rappers over a solid 1994-styled beat. \\"Juicy\\" is an absolute classic, an emotional and effective rags-to-riches look at his upbringing, effectively sampling an 80s R&B hit by Mtume. Another of my favorites is the hopeful \\"Everyday Struggle,\\" which is blessed with the nicest beat on the album, a sunny, clever production over which Biggie recounts the troubles of trying to get by. \\"Me & My B...\\" is a humorous and enjoyable tune, followed by the unforgettable hit \\"Big Poppa.\\" This song has a perfect, Isley Brothers-sampling beat, a head-nodding funker, and shows the humorously seductive BIG at his finest. The well done \\"Respect\\" and catchy \\"Friend of Mine\\" are worthy deep-album cuts, and the DJ Premier-produced \\"Unbelievable\\" has an unforgettable chorus and production. The album closes with one of his most stunning works, \\"Suicidal Thoughts,\\" a depressing insight of life from a suicidal person.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Ready to Die\\" is inspiring, beautiful, and immensely entertaining. This album doesn't sound like it has aged a bit, and even thirteen yeras later sounds as fresh and incredible as the day it dropped. Listeners of any age should be able to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks. Unarguably one of the finest hip hop albums ever, I cannot recommend it any higher.should be able to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|Seven years after Billy Corgan disbanded the infamous 90's mainstream phenomenon, The Smashing Pumpkins is back--well, technically speaking. On drums, Jimmy Chamberlin still has the energy like a ten year old with ADHD and all the poppy snares and thrashing cymbals stand out. Missing, however, are James Iha and D'arcy Wretzsky (including Melissa Auf der Maur if you want to get really technical). Then there's Corgan, of course, still belting out in an angst that feels more intrepid than surreal.<br /><br />  So, what about the album?<br /><br />  \\"Doomsday Clock\\" kicks off Zeitgeist with a gothic primordial sense of dread. The village voice of Corgan's echoes off of Chamberlin's tribe-like drumming with some soloing that brings out the more metallic-like influences of the Pumpkins. Corgan's first words are questions, \\"Is everyone afraid? /Is everyone ashamed?\\" It is obvious there is still a sense of dread and misery in Corgan's life; however, perhaps he feels a bit taller these days. \\"Doomsday Clock\\" is a perfect introduction to the album because the feel and pull of the song pretty much carries out over the remainder of the album.<br /><br />  \\"7 Shades of Black\\" kicks it up a notch and sets a riding rhythmic pace that recalls early Pumpkins life circa Gish-era. The bass sticks out and Corgan's tone is perfect. Squealing guitar lines add some energy which unfortunately comes to an end all too quickly. Much like \\"Zero', the song is plagued by high energy with a short mortality rate. It's all over by the time it comes to life.<br /><br />  Harmonies chant and synchronize and the likes of Foreigner or Duran Duran come to mind in \\"Bleeding the Orchid\\", which is a rocking ballad with a bit more distortion in mind. The key element here is Corgan's knack for guitar instrumentation. This song must look perfect performed under the right lights. The incessant chanting of \\"Bleeding the orchid...\\" tires, but the atmospheric life of the song pulls you in.<br /><br />  \\"That's The Way (My Love Is)\\" comes in at a perfect time. The second single formerly announced by the band is everything a single should be: catchy, memorable, and sticky. Corgan's layered harmonies wall the listener and the distant solos go in and out mish mashing into what may be the best softer rocker the band has to offer anew. While the timid, emotional introduction Corgan plays at the show would befit the actual recording, this song is sure to continue as a crowd pleaser and will eat up the radio.<br /><br />  \\"Tarantula\\" is the obvious first single and much like \\"Doomsday Clock\\" offers an insight into what's the band has to offer. Rioting guitar lines, trigger happy drumming, and soft spells here and there. The chorus is catchy, while the lyrics seem juvenile in comparison to Corgan's back catalogue. Nevertheless, it's still one of the powerhouse tracks on Zeitgeist and implicitly a single.<br /><br />  Much like many albums, the middle tends to get soft. Zeitgeist is no exception. Two songs, \\"Starz\\" and \\"United States\\" is hampered by lengthy tracks (especially the latter) that never really prove endearing or conclusive. The former suffers from an exhaustive amount of double tracking by vocals, perhaps even quadruple tracking here, and the chorus seems clich&eacute; and indifferent. The nearly ten minute opus that is \\"United States\\" is riddled with solos and drum patterns that might seem great live, but on record find themselves lost and repetitive.<br /><br />  By the second half of the album, Corgan brings back the guns of enchanting pop. \\"Neverlost\\" sounds like a b-side to Machina/The Machines of God but with the current edge the band is purporting. Though it also bears similarities, at least in rhythm, to last the Red Hot Chili Peppers tune, \\"Hey\\", off of it's last album Stadium Arcadium--though this is unintentional, of course.<br /><br />  What really shines is \\"Bring the Light\\", quite possible the catchiest song Corgan has written since the Mellon Collie years.From the palm muted opener to the explosive back and forth riffle ball guitar writing to the early 80's soloing, the song will undoubtedly stay in anyone's head. \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\" is fun, but a little too similar to \\"Zero\\" and seems more filler than runner ups to a fan favorite.<br /><br />  The last two songs on the album are surprising. Where it would seem poignant and fitting to have an acoustic, mellow song of the likes of \\"Disarm\\", Corgan chose to take the now concert ballad of \\"For God and Country\\" and revisit the more electronic aspects of his career (e.g. The Future Embrace); therefore, the song now sounds more like a Pet Shops boy cover than the typical ballad that would be fitting. Though the eerie piano notes that recall Pink Floyd's \\"High Hopes\\" fit the song.<br /><br />  Unfortunately Zeitgeist ends with what can be considered the Pumpkins' greatest disappointment of a song (or a closer, for that matter), the very Enya-like \\"Pomp & Circumstance\\". A song more bloated than an Irishman at the end of March. What should have been a sick ending to an already heavy album became a washed out song that really does nothing but add more minutes. The fans are right in believing \\"Gossamer\\" would have been a choice ending.<br /><br />  Zeitgeist is not a perfect album. The production mirrors Queen's works too much, which simply do not cut it for a band like the Smashing Pumpkins. Raw aggression and clean tempos are more fitting and all the energy seems lost in the mixing board. Plaguing the album is the fact that it's a two man show. No longer are the harmonies intertwined with a female presence. It's a constant Corgan to Corgan hodgepodge that is actually more tiring than relaxing.<br /><br />  Corgan seems up front, and not metaphorically, but literally. The vocals at times feel too loud or separate from the band itself. There is missing that third party angle, whose shoes seem to be filled by producer Roy Thomas Baker, who brings an 80's like sound to the whole schlemiel. It works sometimes, but like most fans might say, it's missing Iha.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, Zeitgeist will surely satisfy the hungry appetites of Pumpkinheads and rock or grunge enthusiasts. With sold out shows and festival headlining spots, Zeitgeist  is just a testament to what the band has to offer now. Give it a year and there will surely be some interesting angles for Corgan and his new friends to explore.the Mellon Collie years. From the palm muted opener to the explosive back and forth riffle ball guitar writing to the early 80's soloing, the song will undoubtedly stay in anyone's head. \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\" is fun, but a little too similar to \\"Zero\\" and seems more filler than runner ups to a fan favorite.                The last two songs on the album are surprising. Where it would seem poignant and fitting to have an acoustic, mellow song of the likes of \\"Disarm\\", Corgan chose to take the now concert ballad of \\"For God and Country\\" and revisit the more electronic aspects of his career (e.g. The Future Embrace); therefore, the song now sounds more like a Pet Shops boy cover than the typical ballad that would be fitting. Though the eerie piano notes that recall Pink Floyd's \\"High Hopes\\" fit the song.                Unfortunately Zeitgeist ends with what can be considered the Pumpkins' greatest disappointment of a song (or a closer, for that matter), the very Enya-like \\"Pomp & Circumstance\\". A song more bloated than an Irishman at the end of March. What should have been a sick ending to an already heavy album became a washed out song that really does nothing but add more minutes. The fans are right in believing \\"Gossamer\\" would have been a choice ending.                Zeitgeist is not a perfect album. The production mirrors Queen's works too much, which simply do not cut it for a band like the Smashing Pumpkins. Raw aggression and clean tempos are more fitting and all the energy seems lost in the mixing board. Plaguing the album is the fact that it's a two man show. No longer are the harmonies intertwined with a female presence. It's a constant Corgan to Corgan hodgepodge that is actually more tiring than relaxing.                Corgan seems up front, and not metaphorically, but literally. The vocals at times feel too loud or separate from the band itself. There is missing that third party angle, whose shoes seem to be filled by producer Roy Thomas Baker, who brings an 80's like sound to the whole schlemiel. It works sometimes, but like most fans might say, it's missing Iha.                Nevertheless, Zeitgeist will surely satisfy the hungry appetites of Pumpkinheads and rock or grunge enthusiasts. With sold out shows and festival headlining spots, Zeitgeist  is just a testament to what the band has to offer now. Give it a year and there will surely be some interesting angles for Corgan and his new friends to explore.
B000JJ4PDK|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1994 debut arrived at a turning point for hip hop music. As the old school style from the east coast was slowly growing stale, a new funkier and angrier approach was steadily growing in the form of gangsta rap from the west coast. Then, of course, came \\"Ready to Die,\\" one of the finest hip hop albums of all time, and one that bridged the gap between the old and new schools. This is the album that introduced the world to the incredible rapper and incredible character that was Christopher Wallace. A young, overweight Brooklyn native, a father, and a former hustler, Biggie impressed listeners not only with his talent but his personality on the mic. Technically, he is not short of amazing. His ingenious punchlines, late-night stories, threats, and jokes are delivered in his raspy, cheeky voice with precise technique, always on time and in a perfect flow. Lyrically, he covers many topics but the quality is ever so consistent. On one song, he'll be telling a story of crime, on the next song he'll be poking fun at a ghetto loser, or seducing a woman, nostalgically reminiscing over the past, or dramatically philosophizing about the meaning of life and death. His verses are all meticulously written and never lose your attention. Another reason \\"Ready to Die\\" is so great is the production. The young Sean Combs anchors a production team that uses extensive, clever sampling to create a unique musical backdrop for Biggie. The album is well divided between radio friendly singles and harder, darker songs that would be too rough for radio. The hardcore tracks inspired an entire generation of grimy New York rappers that would reign towards the late 1990s, but the influence of the popular singles could also be felt on urban radio for years to come. \\"Ready to Die\\" is an absolutely classic hip hop album and one of the finest ever, a must have for any collection.<br /><br />The album begins with a dramatic intro, which gives way to \\"Things Done Changed,\\" a well-produced and ironic look back at Biggie's humble roots. \\"Gimme the Loot\\" is one of the songs that shows his lyrical genius, where he plays multiple characters in a conversation, creating a classic track. \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" is an upbeat, funky cut sampling a song by Lords of the Underground for the hook. On the excellent \\"Warning,\\" Biggie again plays multiple characters during conversation, before dropping philosophy on backstabbers and issuing threats. The title track follows accordingly, as does the original mix of \\"One More Chance,\\" a song to a woman about their relationship (the more popular remix is not included on the tracklist). Perhaps my favorite song is the Method Man collaboration \\"The What,\\" a song where the two depressed MCs drop some dark knowledge and philosophy over a great beat. It doesn't get much better than having two of New York's finest rappers over a solid 1994-styled beat. \\"Juicy\\" is an absolute classic, an emotional and effective rags-to-riches look at his upbringing, effectively sampling an 80s R&B hit by Mtume. Another of my favorites is the hopeful \\"Everyday Struggle,\\" which is blessed with the nicest beat on the album, a sunny, clever production over which Biggie recounts the troubles of trying to get by. \\"Me & My B...\\" is a humorous and enjoyable tune, followed by the unforgettable hit \\"Big Poppa.\\" This song has a perfect, Isley Brothers-sampling beat, a head-nodding funker, and shows the humorously seductive BIG at his finest. The well done \\"Respect\\" and catchy \\"Friend of Mine\\" are worthy deep-album cuts, and the DJ Premier-produced \\"Unbelievable\\" has an unforgettable chorus and production. The album closes with one of his most stunning works, \\"Suicidal Thoughts,\\" a depressing insight of life from a suicidal person.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Ready to Die\\" is inspiring, beautiful, and immensely entertaining. This album doesn't sound like it has aged a bit, and even thirteen yeras later sounds as fresh and incredible as the day it dropped. Listeners of any age should be able to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks. Unarguably one of the finest hip hop albums ever, I cannot recommend it any higher.<br /><br />Today, the black covered \\"Remaster\\" is the only version in print as far as I know, because last year some lawsuits emergedo over sampling issues. The remaster includes two bonus tracks, \\"Who Shot Ya?\\" and \\"Just Playing,\\" both worthy additions to the tracklist. Also, the DVD is a welcome bonus, with videos and live performances. It's a pretty nice package for a good price.e should be able to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Hi there! I must say that have not seen the blu-ray edition of this great movie, but as I'm absolutely convinced about the overall quality of the blu-ray format [I have a combo blueray/HDdvd player] I'm sure it will be an enjoyable experience when it will be released here in Spain.   Well, thats my question to whom liked to answer me. What is that 1:66/1 aspect ratio I read in the specifications here at amazon? I think I saw the movie in the theater on a marvelous 2:35/1 ratio. Apart from unusual, the 1:66 is even a worst ratio than the 1:85. Can anyone tell me if it's only a mistake? Do the movie fit all the screen of your tv [1:85 aspect ratio]or not? I really DO prefer [and expected] the 2:35, and an aspect ratio closer to te 1:33 than any other seems to me a joke (and a bad one).  Thanks! Waiting for an answer.  APG

1594489505|5.0|At first I thought I was suffering from Insomniac, later after the many tosses and turns I realized that my mind has been captivated by Khalid Hosseini's book a thousand Splendid suns. It only took me the whole day to finish this book that satisfied my apetitie. Being a great fan of his book the kite runner I have given this book quite a high expectation being that this book will come from a woman's perspective, it was even higher than expected. The book touches on very delicate subjects that concern not only Afghanistan but most of the Islamic and Arabic world. I being a Woman in the Arab world find this book particular close to my heart because I do empathize with the woman in their nation, I may be blessed with being in a nation that encourages woman to work and study we still have many cultural similarities especially when it comes to Reputation.   love, war, friendship, sacrifice and inequality being the main subjects of concerns in Hosseinis novel, A thousand Splendid Suns, Hosseini managed to increase the awareness and give readers a typical life of a person in Afghanistan's oppression. As a writer he managed to really make people empathize with everyone in Afghanistan. I felt as though the scenes were happening in front of my eyes and it sadden me that it all had to end. My mind still is filled with thoughts of Layla, Tariq , Maryam and the many characters in the story. The book is divided in a clever way that begins with the first girl Miriam life and the second division was based on Layla's life. Soon you understand their connection and the strong bond that grows between these two woman under the most goring of circumstances and you will learn to love and forgive. If you do not shed a tear on this book than I think you need to re-read it again!  I really want to thank Khalid Hoessni for this amazing book, it truly was a story that touched my heart and I wish him a great success in his following books and in his UN title.
0143038419|5.0|This book is written in a breezy conversational style that could be read at the beach and taken very lightly - or - it could be read and re-read as a honest search for truth that lifts the reader along with the writer. I felt like her \\"journey\\" became my journey too.  Even though I have not had the same experiences, I understood the process she went through and experienced some of it with her.  I loved everything about this book and recommend it highly.<br />p.s. I hope she writes another book that tells us about the next stages of her inner journey.

B0002NRQTS|4.0|When this album came out in November of 1989 I was no longer an avid Rush fan.  I had other bands stealing my attention.  It wasn't until some years later that I got back into Rush and began to listen to the albums that I had missed.  Presto was one of them, so was Roll The Bones and Counterparts.  Rush had grown kinda tired to me.  There is the old die-hard Rush side of me that digs anything before Moving Pictures (except The Necromancer and maybe Rivendell) and then there is the new Rush fan that likes Signals and Grace Under Pressure and Power Windows.  Rush has always broken their albums up in fours (until recently that is) by making a live album to close the door on another section of Rushtory (History.  KISStory.  Why not Rushtory?) and those live albums have always marked a new direction in the band's sound or motivation.  You can hear the most drastic changes after All The World's A Stage and Exit...Stage Left, but even after A Show Of Hands, Rush continued to change.  Hold Your Fire had already started the progression Rush was formulating with their latter work and Presto is the culmination of that.  Lite and often overlooked, there are still some standout songs here in the mix.  Let's look at the listing:<br /><br />Show Don't Tell - The first time I heard Presto I was hardly impressed.  This song did nothing to minimalize my fears.  After years of listening to this song and the rest of the album, it grows on you.  Presto was one of the first Rush albums that I had to digest for some time before I started to like it.  The is a great song, it just took a while for me to realize it.<br /><br />Chain Lightning - The Presto sound is not gonna go over very well with a lot of the old Rush fans, because it lacks the punch of previous Rush efforts.  You have to look past that and accept that Rush is no longer that band. (YYZ is dead). Chain Lightning is a good song and Neil hasn't lost any of his edge as a lyricist.  Geddy's vocals have become lighter over the years, less sharp, and that my lead to more people liking them.  Face it, Geddy's voice is an acquired taste.<br /><br />The Pass - The started to do this one live again in the past few tours and it is one of thos songs that you have to think about.  Is it about school shooters?  Teen suicide?  Angst?  Maybe all of them.  Poignant.  Impressive.<br /><br />War Paint - The worst thing about Presto is that it is so cohessive, so flowing as an album that the songs tend to blend together.  You have trouble remembering the titles of the songs.  Another teenage angst song.  Good.  Not brilliant.<br /><br />Scars - An over-looked gem.  The rhythm is infectious.  Is this Rush or U2?  I like it.<br /><br />Presto - The title track is an acoustic lesson in life and aspirations.  Straight-forward.  Mellow.  I'm not one to go pointing my finger when I radiate more heat than light.  Strange lyrics.  Builds towards the end into an anthem.  Reminds me of Resist of the latter Test For Echo.<br /><br />Superconductor - One of my personal favorites.  I used to play this in the car all the time and it would drive my wife nuts, but she actually liked it.  This is the ONLY song by Rush that my wife could be said to like.  I just love this song.  It jams.  The riff Alex delivers is cool.<br /><br />Anagram For Mongo - Neil's clever lyrics make this song charming.  Rush was always the Thinking Man's rock band.  Flowing.  Electric.<br /><br />Red Tide - Another personal favorite from this album.  The song itself is okay, but the lyrics are arresting, and Geddy delivers them with heart, making this song great.  About the terrors of human intervention(pollution, AIDS, environmental destruction, etc.)  Fugitives at the bedroom door, lovers pause to find an open store.  Intense.<br /><br />Hand Over Fist - Although Alex's guitar is not as biting as it was say on Moving Pictures or even Power Windows, he gets his point across.  This is an often over-looked song because it's so deep into a very blending album.  There are shreds of greatness here and there and especially in this song.  Alex wails.<br /><br />Available Light - Starts off very dragging and turns into a haunting song.  The lyrics on Presto are still very technical and absorbing and even the lesser tunes bring about a sense of accomplishement.  Reflections of the past.  Streak of light, moving picture, moments caught in time...  For and album ender, Rush put in a gem.<br /><br />Overall, Presto is not a bad album in any sense.  There are many great songs here.  You just have to learn that newer Rush takes some time to digest before you can truly appreciate it.  Had this been the first album by Rush that I ever heard, I probably wouldn't have been a Rush fan.  Since I had some perspective of what they had done and what they were going for with Presto, I wound up liking it alot after some time had passed.<br /><br />Dig it!n this song.  Alex wails.

B00005JPLW|5.0|After I bought and read the graphic novel, I sort of enjoyed the movie more. Of course, don't get me wrong. Frank's drawings are breath taking, but Zack added a little more depth to the story.  For instance, showing why one of spartans went \\"blood drunk.\\" Also, he showed us (in a fiction sense) how much authority women of Sparta can protray. I also couldn't help but yell with one of my friends, \\"%&#$ing right doggie!\\" during the first fight sequence with slow/fast motion.  Thumbs and sliced off toes up!
006441034X|4.0|I picked up the novel this month because I enjoyed Miyazaki's film of it so much. I had read somewhere that the film didn't follow the novel exactly, so I wanted to see where the differences lay.<br /><br />As it turns out, I loved the differences in the novel (and the fleshing out of Sophie and her family situation). Each-film and novel--offer something a bit different, but essentially, it's the story of a cursed Sophie (the Witch of the Waste, beautiful in the novel, a strange and fat big-headed creature in the film), who is turned into an old woman by the jealous witch. Sophie wanders off, liberated by her new old body, and encounters Howl's castle, which, in fact, IS mobile, as well as able to open out to different parts of the land at the turn of a knob. Multi-locatory?<br /><br />The novel (like the film based upon it) is full of people who are under some sort of curse/spell--Sophie, Howl, Calcifer, the scarecrow. But the novel adds other characters, and in so doing, becomes more complex and more interesting for it.<br /><br />Eventually, as in all good fairy tales, things get sorted out. It's in caring about imperfect characters and the outcome of their trials that one has delight. Diana Wynne Jones employs a sort of blithe, even tongue-in-cheeky voice that is a delight to read. All age groups can enjoy this novel. (For concerned parents, no cussing or naughtiness, so it's a safe read.)<br /><br />One thing the movie had that the book doesn't--and that I actually really enjoyed in the movie--is the \\"beast\\" aspect for Howl (in the novel, he doesn't turn into a weird flying monster), and the \\"love thy enemies\\" and compassion that is bestowed on the Witch of the Waste. Wynne Jones doesn't turn the Witch soft and senile. So, as I said, there are merits to the anime interpretation, which allows for transformation of the more extreme sort and a kinder message of forgiveness.<br /><br />In the novel, family problems play a larger role, and so does the apprentice. Romance definitely colors the air. And Howl and Sophie both have growing up to do.<br /><br />It's a fine novel and a fine film, and both should give you great enjoyment. I recommend you get/watch/read both.<br /><br />Mirmance definitely colors the air.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|It's true, I don't recall ever seeing a Jane Austin movie before this.  I have watched it at least 15 times since it arrived 7 months ago.  I love it.  I have since purchased a large number of books and dvd's to keep the story alive.  I highly recommend seeing this version of a timeless novel.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|The film started off well, but got rather boring and turned out to be very pro-Jewish/pro-Israel although in a subtle way.<br /><br />One of the interesting things about the film is that I found it sort of ironic that they played pop American 60s and 70s music in the background which reminds many of the black power and the civil rights era.  Perhaps it was meant to mean that the Iraelis are fighting for their freedom just as the blacks in America (I don't believe that BTW).<br /><br />I didn't like how it seemed as though the Mossad agents could walk though walls and do pretty much whatever they pleased.  It was like bullets could bounce off of them.  More of them were probably wounded in real life and I seriously doubt that tracking down and killing the suspects was as easy as it seemed in this film.  I was wishing something unfortuanate would happen to the main character, because he was portrayed as somewhat of a superman.<br /><br />The final scene was stupid... intimacy with the man's wife was shown as a metaphor for his frustration and passion for tracking down the suspects involved in the Munich olympic massacre.
B000FKO0S8|5.0|Everyone knows that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films of all time.    So my question is this: Where is the HD DVD that we were promised in the summer of 2006!?
B0002NRQTI|4.0|The first thing that becomes apparent as soon as Animate comes on is that the sound of Rush has shifted once again.  From Roll The Bones to this point, Geddy's bass has taken back over in the front of the mix.  Alex is cranked up.  Neil's drums have that acoustic sound once again (sampled?).  Is this the influence of the popularity that is Alternative?  I seriously doubt it.  Rush are great musicians and they when they decide to shift direction, they do not take it lightly.  What we have here is a reshaping of the signature Rush sound.  No matter how bass-heavy it is, no matter what the shred factor is pushed to, it still sounds distinctly like Rush.  This was never one of my favorite Rush outings, but it grows on me with each listen, even after all these years.  One reviewer called this possibly Rush's best album.  PLEASE!  He also said that it was the best of Rush's 90s efforts.  Maybe.  Roll The Bones had a plethora of cool songs on it, though.  Does the heavy sound make people think that this is better than the Rush of the past?  I think it does, and that's deceiving.  There are good songs here and weak songs.  Rush will never produce another Moving Pictures.  Sad but true.  They will produce a ton of great material, but the perfect album scenerio has played out for the boys from Toronto.  Let's go down the song list:<br /><br />Animate - Great driving opener.  Animate pushes the new Rush envelope, creating a heavy, pounding groove that we haven't heard in years.  Excellent start.<br /><br />Stick It Out - At first I hated this song.  It sounded like Rush trying to be someone else trying to sound like Rush.  Does that make sense?  Alternative or metal clones of Rush.  After a couple of hundred listens, it's one of the better songs on this album.  Again, the mauling, crushing sound that Rush manages to create while still staying true to Rush is enthralling.<br /><br />Cut To The Chase - Like Roll The Bones, Counterparts boasts most of its good tunes at the beginning.  This is a great song and the solo is one of Alex's shining spots on the album.  Tight.  Killer.<br /><br />Nobody's Hero - Haunting.  This is one of those songs like Afterimage or Losing It that creeps you out and gives you chills and makes you like it all the same.  Honest.  Meaningful.  Classic.<br /><br />Between Sun & Moon - This song is so f*cking driven it just plain rocks.  The first time I listened to Counterparts, this was the one song that stood out the most.  Great!<br /><br />Alien Shore - Alex is definitely rocking on here.  Slave to the hormone, body and soul.  Neil's lyrics lift this obscure song to the surface.  Complex.<br /><br />The Speed Of Love - Hmmm.  It's all right.  Mediocre? Would I go that far?  Maybe.  This song drags.  Downer.  Boring.<br /><br />Double Agent - When you start getting used to the songs on Counterparts, get familiar with them, you start to realize that Alex has the guitar sound from hell on this album.  The trippy Geddy vocals distorted to Necromancer-esque quality make me flinch.  This song has the potential in places to be great, but it just misses.  The music is very cool.<br /><br />Leave That Thing Alone - Two instrumentals in two albums after a decade- long hiatus.  All right!  Whenever Rush decides to do this, you know it's going to be good.  Leave That Thing Alone rocks out loud.  I can't ever get tired of hearing Alex, Geddy & Neil just jamming away.  Perfection.<br /><br />Cold Fire - The opening Alex riff is killer.  This deep into the album, you start to get tired.  That is the biggest problem with Rush ever since they entered the Age of CD (Hold Your Fire).  They want to give you a full CD worth of songs, but towards the end it becoms tedious.  This is the name of a Dean R. Koontz book that I once read.  I hated that book.  I don't hate this song, but it's never going to be one of my favorites.  Too bad because Alex wails on this song.<br /><br />Everyday Glory - I don't think I've ever heard this song....  Just kidding.  God, I can't tell you that I think this song is good.  It feels like filler to me and that isn't in the Rush repitoire to have filler tunes, but it is extremely bland.<br /><br />Overall,  Counterparts finds Rush creating a sonic redecoration of themselves.  Heavy, for sure.  Once again, the musicianship is excellent.  Rush doesn't get sloppy with their song structures, they just miss the hooks.  Every song can't be memorable, can it?  Long gone are the days of Hemispheres and Signals and Power Windows.  This is newer (older) Rush.  As usual, there are some gems and some yawners.  Not the best album they've ever created.  People who think that should seek treatment for delusions of grandeur.  Good, but not great.<br /><br />Dig it!e filler to me and that isn't in the Rush repitoire to have filler tunes, but it is extremely bland.

B000O75F7C|5.0|Its been about five years now since I first was introduced to the music of Porcupine Tree and I have found that the more I listen, the more I find to like. In another era not so long ago, PT would have been bigger than Pink Floyd was at its zenith and deservedly so. Steven Wilson and his band are so good that they nearly overshadow almost anything else being played today. The music is spectacular, the lyrics are thoughtful and deeply intelligent. The big question is whether Fear of A Blank Planet will be the breakthrough that catapults Porcupine Tree into the upper echelons of superstardom.  That may just be the case. With Alex Lifeson and Robert Fripp on board, literally millions of their fans blissfully unaware that Porcupine Tree exists will now be left wondering how a band so good could have been around so long and escaped popular notice. There is a market for great music out there as the success of bands like Rush and Radiohead proves, its just that there are few outlets for it. With luck, the rising popularity of bands like Porcupine Tree will force a change.  I had to listen to Fear of A Blank Planet several times before I appreciated it as much as I now do. There isn't really a weak point on it. From the first notes of the title cut to the final notes of Sleep Together, the listener will be transfixed by the layers of sound that are both hard-driving and dreamily soaring, and by the relentless despair of the lyrics.  Fans of the last couple of years' harder-edged direction of Porcupine Tree will love the title cut and also or even especially the epic Anesthetize which feature's Rush's Alex Lifeson. Those who prefer the spacier soundscapes of PT's earlier years will enjoy My Ashes, Sentimental, and Way Out of Here. The final cut, Sleep Together, offers something to both camps. Me, I like it all!  Fear of A Blank Planet is a recording that will spend a lot of time in my CD changer. Some have suggested that it may be the album of the year. I say its definitelyin the running. If you haven't yet heard it, listen and hear what I mean. If you have been lukewarm on Porcupine Tree, this should be the album that makes you a confirmed fan.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This CD is the best CD that I have purchased in a long time.  It is a nice return to straight forward rock without any gimmicks or passing fads.  The songs are very raw without too much production or special effects.  There is an energy to the music that reminds me of The Who or Zepplin.  When listening to the CD in the car, it was described by my passenger as hot.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|First off, those who say \\"Its not really Smashing Pumpkins becasue D'arcy and James Iha aren't in the lineup anymore\\" do not know what they are talking about.  Why?  Because its known that for the most Part, Billy Corgan recorded most of the guitar and bass parts for all their past albums.  James Iha and D'arcy played very little on the albums, mainly because they could never really get their parts sounding right.  It was almost all Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlain.  So Iha's and D'arcy's are a dime a dozen...Doesnt matter who plays bass or rhythm guitar for the SP, because Billy and Jimmy are the Smashing Pumpkins.      That said, I think this album is a great return after 7 years!  A nice anthemic heavy rocker...Awesome album, dont miss out!!!
B000002UDD|4.0|So Far, So Good...So What! (1988.), Megadeth's third studio album<br /><br />Dave Mustaine and his band Megadeth were bought to critical acclaim with the release of their second album `Peace Sells...But Who's Buying' in 1986. Mustaine, the man who swore revenge on his former band Metallica had a created a force to be reckoned with and their second release showed they were very much a big part of the Bay Area thrash metal scen. However, like with so many other bands, the road to greater success was to be a tough one. Megadeth had managed to sustain the same line-up for their initial two albums, however towards the end of the `Peace Sells' tour, Mustaine fired guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson due to their drug abuse (culminating in Poland selling some band equipment to aid his drug habit!) This, as expected destroyed a lot of the chemistry within the band and left Mustaine and bassist Dave Ellefson looking for a new drummer and axeman. However, following recruiting drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, Megadeth were once again ready to jam out some kick ass heavy metal. `So Far, So Good...So What!' was released in January 1988 and has gone on to become the Megadeth album which has split fan opinion down the middle...<br /><br />`SFSG...SW' is very much Megadeth's transitional album in more ways than one. It first and foremostly marks a bridge between the rawer, pure thrashy stuff that the first two albums had and the much more technical arrangements that are found on `Rust In Peace'. Secondly, the band itself is in transtion. Guitarist Jeff Young and drummer Chuck Behler do a good job on this album however in many ways they are a temporary bridge between the early line up and the classic line-up (with Marty Friedman and Nick Menza) who would fill their roles following this studio outing. As a consequence of these changes occuring within Megadeth and with their sound, this album produces some interesting results. Some people hold this album with very high regard, often citing it as Deth's best. Indeed I can respect this opinion to a degree, afterall some of Megadeth's finest songs are on here such as `In My Darkest Hour' and `Set The World Afire'. On the contrary, there are Megadeth fans who cite this work as a poor show, lacking consistency and impact. Again I can see where these fans are coming from - the original album's sound came across as very stale (although this is vastly improved on the remaster) and there are also some quite substandard tracks for a band of Megadeth's quality. I personally think the album `JUST' about deserves the 4* rating I've given it as it contains some exceptionally good tracks. It is however an album of choppy inconsistencies with the good songs being marred by tracks such as `502', `Anarchy In The UK' and `Liar'. These songs often come across as rushed, somewhat uninspired and juvenile. Indeed given Mustaine's level of drug abuse at the time and the state he was in during much of the recording sessions, it is not surprising this album is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of quality.<br /><br />Following Megadeth's re-union in 2004 with the release of 'The System Has Failed', Dave Mustaine personally helped remaster the band's back catalogue. With 'So Far, So Good...So What!' the remaster is excellent. The sound quality on the remastered version is much clearer as opposed to the rather stale production which plagued the original release. The remaster of the album also has demos for 'Into The Lungs Of Hell', `Set The World Afire', `Mary Jane' and `In My Darkest Hour'.<br /><br />`Into The Lungs Of Hell' opens the album and what a cool opener this is. A stately opening gives way to a blisteringly quick instrumental song with awesome riffs aplenty! Following the opener is one of my personal favourite Megadeth tracks `Set The World Afire'. This was the first post-Metallica song Mustaine wrote and what a thrash metal classic this is. Some fiery, tripletly riffing gets the song going before Mustaine comes in with the vocals over one fantastic guitar line. For a song with power, aggression and vigour look no further. So at this stage, it is `So Far, So Good' however we are then graced by the `So What' aspect of the album with `Anarchy In The UK'. A cover song which has divided fan opinion, I personally don't think it works that well at all. The whole song sounds quite tired and lifeless (even on the remaster!) and Mustaine even gets some of the lyrics wrong. However the album picks itself up again next with `Mary Jane', an atmospheric song with some great, signature Megadeth riffs.<br /><br />The choppy waters of this album re-emerge with `502'. Another substandard track with a theme of cop car chases. The siren sounds on the track get annoying after a while and the lyrics are pretty uninspired and juvenile. Then following this, we are treated to another classic `Deth song in `In My Darkest Hour'. This 6 minute beast has a great acoustic opening before some great chugging riffs come in. The track builds to a climax towards the end as it garners speed. Mustaine gives an excellent vocal performance in this song which was dedicated to fallen Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Then we have `Liar'. Musically I find this track pretty good (save the chorus) however the lyrics really let the song down - an attack on former guitarist Chris Poland, it is just that bit childish and laughable. However Mustaine hits the mark lyrically in the closing track `Hook In Mouth'. Another classic song, it is a `1984' inspired track which also attacks the PMRC musical sesoring movement. The guitar work is snarling and the `F-R-E-E-D-O-M' chorus is especially great.<br /><br />All in all, `So Far, So Good...So What' is a mixed bag which for me is fortunately held together by 3 extremely strong tracks. Some love it, some hate it, its one of those albums. If you are a fan of Megadeth, I would recommend this album as it contains some great material in parts. However if you're new to the band then `Rust In Peace' is the place to start as it is the album that displays the Megadeth sound at its technical and creative best. With `SFSG...SW' the band is rediscovering it's direction. This album is a key part in the development of Megadeth however it is consequentially a mixed one.<br /><br />MY RATING: 7/10the vocals over one fantastic guitar line.

B000E8QVWY|3.0|it was interesting to learn about Johnny Cash's life and music. Although it turns out that his life is just the same as every other rock star whose life gets the Hollywood Biopic treatment.    About this time last year I saw \\"Ray\\", and the similarities between the two movies are numerous. Both Ray Charles and Johnny Cash are haunted by the death of a brother in childhood. Both struggle against the odds to become hit musicians. Both get mixed up in drugs, and have tumultuous love lives. Both get busted by the police at one point for their drugs. Both eventually get cleaned up with help from their woman.    The similarity of the source material cannot, I suppose, be helped, but I think Hollywood is still guilty of trying to apply the cookie cutter mold to the rock star biopic. Or really any Hollywood biopic. The scene where the husband and wife are shouting in the kitchen and the wife starts crying has got to be in just about every biopic I have ever seen.    Still, I did learn an interesting thing or do from this movie. I guess the biggest surprise was that Johnny Cash, whose name is frequently used as a litmus test for coolness in college dormitories, was once climbing the pop charts and on tour with such common pop stars as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.
0743298020|1.0|This book sucks. No real depth was given to any characters in this book. Read only if you want to waste your time.
1591396190|2.0|Overall mildly interesting; though I would not recommend to read.  Much of this book is obvious and what you and I should remember from all the strategy books we read 20 years ago (avoid competition by developing new markets - the essence of blue ocean strategy; value innovation which is just innovation that has an implied market).  Overall this is a re-hash of previously published theory with a smattering of interesting ideas (much strategy analysis that looks at the `firm' or `industry' is not that useful and it might be better to look at the `strategic move'; there is no such thing as a perpetually high performing firm).  I also disagree with the premise that creating developing a new market leads to a unique offering \\"at the lowest cost\\" which is one of the comparisons with red ocean strategy that, according to the authors, force all industries to center on differentiation or cost, since in a brand new market there is no competition so cost is not even as important as in the red oceans.  It is on as the market develops and attracts competition that cost becomes more important.  Either these authors have not read widely (they argue that Built to Last and In Search of Excellence were wrong since many case study firms in those books later fell from grace) or they did not take away from those books and others what they should have about market development, dynamics, and evolution.  Don't both with this book - buy In Search of Excellence and revel in the exciting times that was then.
B000RGSOR8|5.0|This was the first I'd heard of St. Vincent, and this album really hit the spot. There are tracks whose lyrics feel sincere, not crafty, in their quirkiness, which makes her more interesting and less \\"delicate poetess-y\\" than similar-sounding artists, like Rachel Loshak maybe; and then there are other tracks that are straightforward and beautiful (e.g., \\"All My Stars Aligned\\" -- my favorite, for now). And she can sing. Which is often not something you get in this genre. Having been listening to Scout Niblett and Joanna Newsom for my feminine fare, St. Vincent is a welcome addition indeed!
B0002EXH4A|4.0|So Far, So Good...So What! (1988.), Megadeth's third studio album<br /><br />Dave Mustaine and his band Megadeth were bought to critical acclaim with the release of their second album `Peace Sells...But Who's Buying' in 1986. Mustaine, the man who swore revenge on his former band Metallica had a created a force to be reckoned with and their second release showed they were very much a big part of the Bay Area thrash metal scen. However, like with so many other bands, the road to greater success was to be a tough one. Megadeth had managed to sustain the same line-up for their initial two albums, however towards the end of the `Peace Sells' tour, Mustaine fired guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson due to their drug abuse (culminating in Poland selling some band equipment to aid his drug habit!)

B000FTWB7G|5.0|Amy Lee is fantastic--far from overrated!  What a great album--not only is she a prodigy in terms of musical composition, but her lyrics are poetic.  She puts on a great live show, too--real stuff.  Any rock guitarist, like myself, would be lucky to be in her band.  She's a feminist--get over it.  ;)  Everybody should be.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Having listened to this cd a number of times now, and I'm glad to say that it's a great album. This might actually be their best album since Melancholy. Even though two of the band members are not present in the current band, it doesn't really show. The songs are just as good as ever. Zeitgeist feels like it consists of almost every type of alternative rock music. You've got hard rocking songs, ballads, solos, electronica, and more.     It's got a little bit of everything, which is why it makes it so good. Adore and Machina had a certain...feel to them. Where all the songs sounded, not exactly the same, but from the same recording sessions. With Zeitgeist though, there's variety. Sometimes not having fluidity is a good thing. I like to be surprised, and this album delivers. I only have a few problems.     One, is that the vocals are a little too layered sometimes. There are sometimes too many different Billy's singing at once. Another, is that 3 other versions of the album have three different bonus songs. Now, if those 3 songs were on one album, making a 15 song cd, it would make Zeitgeist even better. Unfortunately this is not the case. You could always add the songs later on your computer though.     Besides that, I really like this cd. After a couple listens, I can honestly say that it ranks as my third favorite smashing pumpkins cd next to Siamese Dream and Melancholy. A great effort. I was worried, but I'm very happy with the end result.     The great songs-  Doomsday Clock  Bleeding the Orchid  That's the Way  Tarantula  United States  Bring the Light  For God and Country    The good songs-  7 Shades of Black  Starz  Neverlost  Come on Let's Go  Pomp and Circumstances    The bonus tracks, Death From Above, Stellar, and Zeitgeist are all great songs as well. They really should all be on the album.

B00008BXJ6|5.0|After getting \\"Back in Black\\" a long time ago, I decided to check out a Bon Scott-era AC/DC album. Sure enough, it was \\"High Voltage\\". While it may not be remembered as much as \\"BIB\\", \\"High Voltage\\" shows that even when an album doesn't sell ten-million plus copies, it can still be awesome. Being AC/DC's first of many albums, this can tend to not get as much airplay or critical acclaim (because Heaven knows that the critics must have been outraged hearing this in '76!). However, the music rocks and this is actually one of AC/DC's best albums.    \\"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\": A five minute opener filled with plenty of crunchy riffs, an excellent performance by Bon, and even a bagpipe solo! (The Young brothers and Scott were from Scotland.) An awesome anthem that gets things off to a great start.  \\"Rock and Roll Singer\\": The riffs provide an excellent groove, one of AC/DC's finest, and Bon delivers lyrics about living the dream of being a rock star. Another great anthem!  \\"The Jack\\": One of AC/DC's most immortal songs. This is a six-minute, vintage-styled blues song with so many double-entendres, it's brilliant! The whole song flows excellently, and I get a kick out of the ending!  \\"Live Wire\\": According to the booklet inside the album, this song kicked off concerts for years in their early career, and one can see why. This is also the second-longest song on the album with an amazing guitar solo by Angus Young, prefiguring those of his future.  \\"TNT\\": Ha! Probably even people who don't listen to AC/DC (and in this day and age, virtually every rock fan does) have heard this song. Love the guitar riff, it has a great groove, and you can tell Bon Scott had a blast singing them lyrics! An AC/DC staple even thirty years later, this is good-time rock and roll!  \\"Can I Sit Next To You, Girl\\": This song has an old-fashioned swing to it that gives a unique touch to the album. A cool song, this makes me think of what it must have been like going toa high-school dance in AC/DC's time.  \\"Little Lover\\": Another blues-styled rocker very similar to \\"The Jack\\", but the lyrics are less double-entendre styled and more of those \\"I'm so in love with my lady!\\" lyrics, which make for a nice image, coming from Bon Scott's one-of-a-kind delivery.  \\"She's Got Balls\\": Such a title would bring up very strange confusion, and hearing them is another. Imagine hearing a twenty-year-old guy with shoulder-length hair and arm tattoos wailing, \\"The lady's got balls!/ She's got BA-A-ALLS!\\". Nevertheless, another great groove-rocker.  \\"High Voltage\\": More lyrics about being an independent and free rocker, you gotta love it! The riff is great, too, and sounds a bit like T. Rex's \\"Bang A Gong, Get It On\\" riff. Actually, I read that Malcolm Young was a fan of the band, so that makes perfect sense. An excellent way to close the album.    Overall:  \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine said this was an \\"all-time low\\" in hard rock history when it first came out. Now, it's sold more than 3 million in the U.S. alone, and still boasts a handful of AC/DC classics! After having listened to this album for a long time, those critics couldn't be further from the truth! Anyway, the remastering on this album is excellent, the raw tone of the guitars is great, and this is an album that is sure to keep you interested. The only thing I would like to point out is that, compared to later albums, the remastering of the drums on this album is terrible! Hearing it on \\"It's A Long Way...\\", compared to songs such as \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\", or countless others, it could have used more work!    Anyway, with all things said and done, this is a great debut album from five guys that know rock and roll! If you like AC/DC, you're gonna love this album! Thanks for the time, catch ya later!
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I've loved Billy Corgan's songwriting for so much of my life and this album he continutes to never repeat himself musically or lyrically. He's always grown well as an artist and his songs are always straight from the heart. I really enjoy his voice, approach to playing guitar in new ways on each album, the keyboard/piano additions to the songs, and jimmy's drums are perfectly fitting. When your as established as Corgan you can not please everyone and will forever be judged based on your past glorys (his are impossible to live up to) so i'm very thankful someone of his abilities still has the drive to write new music and make it fun for both himself and the fans. adore, machina 1/2, zwan, the future embrace, and zeitgeist are all big jumps from one to another and continues to impress me with what he's capable of.     Listen to the songs for what they are, forget the past albums and songs, and be thankful Billy is as well rounded as he is. I very much Enjoy Zeitgeist.

B000089RV6|5.0|I can't really think of anything too specific to say about \\"Back in Black\\". One day, I bought the album, listened to it and had one of the biggest musical joyrides I can recall! Critics may despise AC/DC, but that's no reason to neglect this album! In fact, this qualifies not only as being one of the biggest-selling rock albums of all time, but one of the greatest. That being said, \\"Back in Black\\" is probably the first album people will think about whenever AC/DC is mentioned, and while they have a great selection in their catalogue, this is, no doubt, their finest hour.   From the guitar crunch of the Young brothers, from Malcolm's rock-solid rhythm playing to Angus's legendary riffs, licks and solos, this no doubt qualifies as a great guitar album. Then comes in the rhythm section of Cliff Williams on bass and Phil Rudd on drums, and while Phil Rudd may not have the same chops as John Bonham, Phil still makes his drums sound larger than life, which makes for a great cornerstone of the AC/DC groove. And then...Brian Johnson. Who would have thought after such a great lead singer as Bon Scott passed away, Brian Johnson would be able to fill in his role, and fill it in greatly, as well. His voice may take some getting used to, but he definitely sounds best on this album.   In addition, the remastering is excellent. The volume is up and there's no static or unneccesary noise that ruins the sound. After all, there's nothing as disappointing as hearing a great song like it was recorded a mile away! Anyway, this album is just flat-out excellent for those who dig such a sound. Ten songs at a little over forty minutes, and a cross between a hard-rock crunch and an old-school groove for each song, AC/DC did just about everything they could right on this album.   As a summary, this album will make you forget your problems, imagine these guys on stage at night in a big, sold-out arena, playing these rockers loudly and proudly, and, of course, prove to be a testament of time and rock and roll. And remember, take no pressure from the critics. Be your own person! Rock out and feel good about it! And remember, \\"rock and roll ain't noise pollution...it just makes good, good sense!\\" Peace!
0375507256|3.0|While I get that the 6 stories were supposed to be related, I found all the reincarnation babble incredibly cheesy compared to the rest of the writing, and found it tedious to have to stop the middle of one story, start another, then continue it much later and forget who was supposed to be who. I obligingly read the book in order though, expecting a payoff, but found not much reason for this style other than the reincarnation cutesiness.  However, a couple of the stories were extremely well-written and enjoyable, the first one about Adam Ewing being the least so (what was that?? So boring compared to the rest of the book, I can't figure out why he would choose to begin and end his book with that).  The centerpiece story, the one that is uninterrupted, is absolutely my favorite, it brought me near tears several times. I would read this book again, but I would just read each story uninterrupted and skip the first one.

Wow.<br /><br />In Black Snake Moan Christina Ricci is a sex-addicted Southern Girl that crosses paths with an aging Blues singer that takes her in and tries to get her life turned around...albeit against her will. Now that might not sound like the most thrilling movie of the year, but up until the last 20 - 30 or so minutes of the movie I was thinking that Black Snake Moan should get a Globe or Oscar nod.<br /><br />An air of suspense throughout the film never lets up with that something-really-bad-is-about-to-happen feeling. And indeed sometimes something bad does happen, but ultimately Black Snake Moan turns into a feel good movie (for adults). It's sometimes warm and funny, and it certainly has its violent moments...not to mention some pretty strong sex scenes that you don't normally see a leading lady like Ricci participate in on film.<br /><br />While the movie won't lead to a Samuel L. Jackson singing career, he ain't that bad of a blues singer. Funny thing about Jackson is that he plays pretty much the same character in every single movie that he's in...which is such a cool character; it just seems to work in everything he does from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars to S.W.A.T. to Black Snake Moan. In Black Snake Moan it's like watching an aged Jules Winnfield [[ASIN:B000068DBC Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] singin' the Blues.<br /><br />The final quarter of the movie seems hastily put together and a bit predictable. And the entire movie is a little bit of stretch considering how receptive Ricci's character (and others) becomes to her forced situation with Jackson's character.<br /><br />But overall, the movie is very good. It may not be a collector, but it's a rental that might be one of the best I've looked at this year.
B00003CX5P|4.0|There were many good points to this movie. First, you get to see young Anakin. You get to see his humble beginnings and hear the mother tell how she immaculantly conceived her son. To me, this suggests someone such as Darth Sidious (The eventual EMPEROR) perhaps influenced \\"the force\\" to somehow impregnate Anakin's mom. (Thus making Ultimate Evil the grandfather of Luke Skywalker)<br /><br />If you think about it, that makes sense, But the good in the mother \\"white washed\\" some of the bad of each father out of the offspring. Anakin's mom's goodness allows Anakin to struggle with good vs bad. He eventually turns bad, but it's not easy and he's not really happy about it. His evil is cut in half from the emperor's because Anakin/Darth Vader has a heart. Has the capacity for love. And this comes to light when he finally learns to love Luke in Episode Six. (His love for Padme is almost part of his undoing).<br />Padme's goodness is what tempers Luke and Leia's hearts and keeps them from turning. (Likewise I imagine this happens further on down the line, but you never know unless you read the books, because there aren't anymore movies to go on.)<br /><br />ANYWAY, let's rein in the tangent truck here. The point is this movie, Episode 1. It's a great flick. There just should have been Less JAR-JAR and more Darth Maul!<br /><br />It sets up another problem. I realize Anakin is apparently a few years younger than Padme, but this is just skirted over as the series wanes on. He's a boy when they first meet. How are we to believe they fall in love when she's like 25 when they meet and he's like 10?<br /><br />All in all, my least favorite of the six. But from such a Star Wars Fanatic, even my least favorite is still very much enjoyed!
B0000640S1|4.0|You ever happen to catch an 80's action flick on TV and think \\"Man I used to Love these movies\\" only to be chuckling to yourself a few minutes later as you realize just how bad the movie really is. I've done that on a few occasions with flicks like \\"Hard to Kill\\", \\"Silent Rage\\", \\"Tango and Cash\\" etc. So when I sat down to watch \\"First Blood\\" again after not seeing the film in about a decade I was expecting the worst. I was actually pleasantly surprised. \\"First Blood\\" still holds up as a great action flick. Stallone gives a solid performance with his first go as John Rambo, none of the action-flick cliches or hammy acting that ruined  his later movies like \\"Cobra\\" are present. One thing I got out of my most recent viewing that I never noticed before was the sympathy you begin to feel for Sheriff Will Teasle. Instead of just a run-of-the-mill bad guy, Sheriff Teasle finds himself in a situation where he is in over his head, and at a complete loss as to how to handle it. Initially he is just trying to protect his small town from what he considers a bad element, things get out of his control quickly, and he is stuck trying to mop things up. Rediscover this movie, like \\"Rocky\\", \\"First Blood\\" is one of Stallone's movies that you can enjoy as much today as you did during the Reagan administration.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|Nicholas Hooper's score is a beautiful hour of music that fully complements the magic of the darkest book and film to date, Order of the Phoenix.    I thought the first four scores were adequate, but I had just a few problems. Good old John Williams, undoubtedly a great composer, scored the first three films, but much of the time just copied the trumpets and clarinets of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Hook and Jurassic Park. That's not to say he had no original material, as Prisoner of Azkaban was a great improvement over 1 and 2, but his usual repetiveness and over-scoring of the films (count the amount of times Hedwig's Theme is played in the first film) began to overwhelm the film and its source material.    Patrick Doyle, god bless him for trying, took a far too conservative approach to Goblet of Fire. He was able to capture some of the growing romance with his cute waltzes, but failed to capture the more action-packed scenes. At times some of the lighter fare seemed more appropriate for a British romantic-comedy.    The reason I like (rather, love) Hooper's score is the fact that the studio could have chosen any big name composer (Williams, Zimmer, Elfman, Howard), but chose a relatively unknown BAFTA winner with a modest televison resume. It is with these low expectations that perhaps made the score such an amazing listen. Take one of the best tracks, \\"Dumbledore's Army,\\" which takes a light approach, but unlike Doyle, avoids the tongue in cheek comedy loops that hurt Doyle's comparative work. \\"DA\\" is playful without being overcooked, a la Williams. Consider the opening track, \\"Fireworks,\\" which takes the unconventional orchestra and electric guitar and turns it into two minutes of rebellious broom flying with a hint of Irish influence. No evidence of the Star Wars theme or Indiana Jones, just original and innovative music.    Whether it is loud and fast paced (\\"The Serious Deception,\\" \\"Flight of the Order of the Phoenix\\") or soft and romantic (\\"The Kiss,\\" \\"Loved Ones and Leaving), Hooper packs an amazing array of diversity into this relatively shorter than average score. Dare I say its even worth an Oscar nod? Give it a listen.

B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie was and IS a classic. From the first moment to the last, this movie is touching, moving, action-packed, humorous and just plain unbelievable.<br /><br />I can't add much to my review that hasn't already been said, but I like this collector's edition. I liked the extras and I loved watching the finished product. Tom Hanks brought this character to life. This movie isn't a script. It's a story that Tom Hanks took control over. It's a part that he was born to play. And he played it to the hilt!<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved loved this movie!!!

B000MNP2K8|5.0|When I first heard that Daniel Craig was playing Bond, I had my reservations because I didn't think he had that \\"Bond look\\", not to mention I was hoping for another Pierce Brosnan Bond flick.  But being a huge Bond fan, I knew i'd still go see Casino Royale anyway and I thought it was excellent.  The amount of action in this one surpasses some of the Bond movies of the past (who could forget the opening chase scene with Bond and the bomber that he chased damn near all over the city?).  This had what you would expect from the 007 franchise:  Hot Bond Girls, Action, High tech cars/gadgets, etc.    The only real problem I had with this movie was that Q (formerly played by the late Desmond Llewelyn, now played by John Cleese) was nowhere to be found in the movie.  I love seeing what new gadgets are being cooked up at Q branch.  But I guess since this was supposed to be based on 007's 1st major mission that it hadn't yet come into play for him.  Oh well at least we got M (Judi Dench is in my opinion the best to ever play the role).  Hopefully the next one'll have M, Q, Moneypenny, etc.
0316067598|4.0|What a story! This book provides great insight into the Navy Seals and their training and missions. Gripping on the whole, about the only criticism I have is that it gets off to a slow start. Perhaps the first few chapters about training should have been appendices. All things considered, it is an educational and fascinating read about a story that will long remain a legendary chapter in military lore.
B00006G8HX|4.0|I'd like to give this one 3.5 stars. It just wasn't spectacular. I graded up for one simple reason. This movie brings SPOCK back from the dead. And frankly it's believable, within the fictional (science fictional that is) parameters of Star Trek. Any student of Gene Roddenberry believes that the events of Star Trek Three COULD possibly happen, given a set of necessary circumstances.<br /><br />As to the content of this boxed set or whatever you call it, I find it somewhat lacking. I would have liked to have seen more \\"making of...\\" with deleted scenes, outtakes and what not. It just seems as though this package suffers from imagination. The movie doesn't suffer, but the overall package does. The movie is well-acted. There are problems, but ehhh... I can live with most of them.
B000QCUB8I|4.0|If the opening seconds of Justice's debut album, \\" ,\\" don't tell you a thing about what you're in store for, you aren't listening. The mudded brass come marching in like they are coming to destroy, and in a way they are. Justice is a dance/electronica group, to be sure, but to label them as such is travesty in and of itself. Like that imperial death march, Justice is here to destroy. In this case, they have come to demolish your preconceived notions about what dance music is and what it can be. Now, until recently I have avidly campaigned against the genre which I feel is cluttered with mundane \\"artists\\" who rely on bad samples and horrendous loops to captivate a somewhat dimwitted audience. My opinion is slowly starting to change as I am introduced to artists who are challenging this perception. Justice is one of them.<br /><br />From the opening track to the very last second of \\",\\" I found myself, not only captivated, but amazed, entertained, and energized. Justice comes off as a bull charging towards its victim, with so much momentum and energy that attempting to slow it down would be a fruitless endeavor. Their songs are constantly changing, never relying on a single loop or phrase for too long. And these songs are not lite, easy-listening electronica songs either. They're harsh and brash, with the mids turned up too high for comfort. It's not your average dance album, it is a revelation!<br /><br />\\"Let There Be Light\\" begins with a near-unlistenable melody, but adds in drums, a thumping bassline, and so many cuts and glitches that you'll be in love with it before you know it. It concludes with an absolutely awesome composition that harmonizes synths with synths in a way that sounds like it'd be better suited for the closing credits of a Super Mario Bros. game than a dance record. \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" is one of the few songs on \\" \\" with actual vocals, and while I found them a bit childish and annoying at first, I was shocked to find the song stuck in my head hours after I first encountered. The song sounds like the Jackson 5 on methamphetamines, if only for the lyrics, \\"Do the D.A.N.C.E., stick to the B.E.A.T.\\" The disco-esque strings and sing-along quality of the song make the song a sure-fire hit, which is probably why it is the album's first single.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, there's the cut-filled \\"New Jack,\\" the completely overpowering, yet satisfying \\"Phantom Pt. I\\" (and it's more audience friendly second part), and the 100% guilty pleasure \\"The Party.\\" The latter features such terrible rap-lines as \\"Let's get drunk and freaky-fied,\\" and if you actually find yourself liking it, then you may want to see if pigs grew wings. It's the one low point on an otherwise flawless album.<br /><br />The best part about \\"\\" is the fact that it never gets boring, an attribute clearly made possible by the group's insistence on keeping the songs fresh around every corner and their refusal to use one loop or riff for any extended period of time. The quality of the songs is through the roof, and the genres touched upon in each song are too numerous to mention. While \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" is clearly your crowd-pleaser, songs like \\"Stress\\" (which envokes serious Requiem for a Dream soundtrack memories) and \\"Waters of Nazareth\\" are designed for the sole purpose of making you nod your head in approval while simultaneously scratching it, thinking \\"What the heck am I listening to?\\" \\" \\" is an achievement in electronic music that should be listened to by fans and naysayers of the genre alike.

B000EGFVQS|2.0|For the past 3 years or so, I have heard nothing but acclaim for  The Lovely Bones, I just never took the time to find out for myself. However, this summer my teacher assigned this as summer reading. I was excited to see what all the buzz was about.    But The Lovely Bones left me disappointed. I couldn't feel a strong enough connection with the story or the family. I didn't feel comfortable in Susie's \\"heaven\\", and the strange possession of Ruth's body weirded me out. The most exciting parts were the parts that got sort of murder-mystery on you.     When I finished it, I felt like I should feel uplifted--but I wasn't.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|On December 2, 2000, I threw my hands into the air triumphantly. I jumped up and down, shouted, cheered, and I even danced a little. On that day, Smashing Pumpkins played their farewell show at The Metro. Despite the band having helped define my early adolescence, they haunted my ears during the last few years of the 20th century. Over the years, I had grown less enchanted with the band's music and more frustrated with front man Billy Corgan's vocal stylings. So on that glorious winter day in 2000, I celebrated the fact that the band would no longer be around to destroy my memories. I could now remember my pre-1996 Pumpkins without the constant distraction of new albums and singles. Then on June 21, 2005, Mr. Corgan unofficially announced that he planned on reuniting the band to create a new album and I could feel myself dying a little inside. So now, after 7 years of silence, Smashing Pumpkins are back. And not only has their lineup changed, but my opinion of them as well.<br /><br />As expected, the Pumpkins have undergone a major change in their sound. Their strong alt-rock sound of the early 90s that I cherished is long gone, replaced now with a heavier, progressive feel. This is most clearly evidenced by \\"Zeitgeist's\\" centerpiece, \\"United States,\\" a sprawling 10-minute epic that would be a dead-ringer for Tool if it weren't for Corgan's nasally vocals. Even the album's softer, more poignant moments are almost insultingly loud. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin sounds better on this album than he ever has before, perhaps unleashed by the band's new direction.<br /><br />Since the band's breakup in 2000, my dislike of Billy Corgan's voice has only been reinforced by his solo album and the forgettable Zwan. So I wasn't expected to be wowed by Corgan when I began listening to \\"Zeitgeist,\\" and unsurprisingly they're still not that impressive. Oftentimes, it sounds as if his vocals are on a completely different plane from the rest of the band. Take, for example, \\"Doomsday Clock,\\" in which the disparity between the vocals and the band are at their most notable. At the same time, however, Corgan's vocals have a peculiar appeal to them that only reveals itself as the album progresses. I was surprised to find that even though Corgan's vocals bothered me as the album began, I was completely fine with them by the time the album finished. They hardly perturb me at all now.<br /><br />The album begins with the highly-impressive \\"Doomsday Clock\\" in which Corgan foretells the downfall of the civilized world, singing \\"Kafka would be proud to find out I'm certain of the end, it's the means that has me spooked!\\" Chamberlin's excellent drumming not only gets the song off to a great start, but it carries it throughout it's length. \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\" is less impressive, all around. Billy's vocal performance is lackluster at best, and his melody is forgettable. There is some redemption to be found in the synth-heavy instrumentation, however, though it's not enough to save the song in my opinion.<br /><br />Fortunately, the next two tracks, \\"Tarantula\\" and \\"Starz\\" are enough to take your mind off of it. \\"Tarantula\\" is an unrelenting rock song that features a truly impressive guitar performance (seriously, someone make a phone call and get this song on the next Guitar Hero) and finds Billy singing \\"We are the real if real ever was. And just because we are the ruin of every living soul, we are surreal cause someone gave us up.\\" The first time I heard it, I didn't care for it. Since then, it's become one of my favorites on the album. Moving on, despite the fact that \\"Starz\\" shares the name of a television network, it has quickly become my favorite song on \\"Zeitgeist.\\" The part of the song when Billy sings \\"We are stars, we are,\\" is so excellently produced that it quickly becomes ingrained in your memory. Add that to the undeniably awesome last 30-seconds of the song, and you have yourself one of the better Pumpkins songs of the last 15 years or so.<br /><br />Other notable tracks on the album are \\"United States\\" (of course) and \\"Bring the Light\\" a blatantly religious song in which Billy sings \\"You'd spit upon my dust and mix my ash with your blood\\" just before revealing his subject as \\"Son of God.\\" If the Tool inspiration wasn't clear to you on \\"United States,\\" it should be apparent by the time the breakdown of this one comes around.<br /><br />So what have I learned from \\"Zeitgeist?\\" I've learned that just because an artist or a band hasn't put out a respectable album in over a decade does not mean that they have \\"lost it.\\" I've learned that I can actually handle Billy Corgan's vocals, even if it requires that I saturate my head with them. Most importantly, however, I've learned that Smashing Pumpkins are absolutely back! The band may have lost two very important members, but under the guidance of Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin, I'd say that Jeff Schroeder and Ginger Reyes are doing just fine. Despite the fact that \\"Zeitgeist\\" may be a few tracks too long (depending on which version of it you ultimately end up buying), it is without a doubt the best pure rock album of 2007 so far. This declaration comes to you courtesy of someone who wasn't expecting much of \\"Zeitgest\\" and ended up getting something great.

0446677450|3.0|I will give this book just three stars. Not less because, after all, it has a purpose. Not more because I don't think the advice that is given there is so great.<br /><br />Basically the book explains that we should put the money we earn into assets, so our investments could turn into profits. Although people can brag and say there is nothing new on this statement, some of these same people just not practice such concept. So this book just helps to remind everyone of us that there are alternative ways other than working for someone else to get an additional income and strives to create a financial awareness on the reader. This is the only purpose.<br /><br />However, I believe that no one is willing to - or can - give up on your daily needs and leisure opportunities just to put all of their money \\"to work for them\\", as Kiyosaki constantly repeats over the book. By the way it was written, seems that the author does not stimulate much hard work, but wise-thinking and exploring the opportunities of speculation that can lead you to win a lot of money, but may also cause you to lose everything.<br />That's what I don't like on that book; it promotes an ode to exploitation with little effort as if this was an accessible and fast option for anyone to choose, but doesn't tell what the associated risks with such practices are.<br /><br />This book is just entertaining, nothing else.
B00005JN0T|3.0|In the future, humans are able to create artificial intelligence on a grand scale.  In this movie, it takes the form of cyborg robots that are used by humans for common everyday tasks.  For the right price, you can have your own driver, nanny, maid, personal chef, etc.  But what happens when the artificial intelligence becomes aware of mankind's propensity for self-destruction, especially when they are programmed to protect all human life?  The answer: the robots rebel and attempt to eliminate those humans who pose the biggest threats.  Oddly enough, none of them were named HAL.<br /><br />The storyline was interesting, but I kept getting the sense that I had seen it before.  The acting was good, Will Smith delivers another stellar performance.  Overall, this one falls into the \\"just okay\\" category.  It's a good rent if the shelves are otherwise bare.
B00078XGRO|4.0|This was the last movie that was even halfway decent. After this one, I don't know why any more were ever made. There is so much you can do with the star trek franchise and THIS film proves it. It's the first time they have the screen all to themselves (which is to say without the old crew) and it's the only time that they do a decent job of carrying on the torch that was passed to them by the original crew.<br /><br />First Contact has some of the best actors around. James Cromwell and Alfrie Woodard are positively wonderful additions to the Star Trek phenomena. There were just too many questions left. Too many loose ends left untied. And too many times when I said \\"so what.\\" during the show. The crew exists as cardboard cutouts of their television personas. The most dynamic character in this movie is the Borg Queen. And that is just amazingly disappointing.
B00000K0EA|5.0|Traumatised by my ghasty experience of watching 'Casino Roayle', I decided to cheer myself up by watching a really good Bond movie.  I never really cared that much for Pierce Brosnan by comparison with my favourite Bond, Roger Moore, but compared with the dreary nonentity in 'Casino Royale' Brosnan is a prince among men.    This film has everything you want in a Bond movie. Among the many pleasures of this film is an outstanding performance by Jonathan Pryce, clearly enjoying himself hugely playing the mad villain, media mogul Elliot Carver (who bears a striking resemblance to Rupert Murdoch, quite coincidental I am sure).  There is lots of humour, plenty of amazing gadgets, a most satisfyingly tough heroine who can do amazing karate kicks, and the most thrilling chase ever in a Bond movie, with Bond and the fesity heroine handcuffed together on a motor bike, tearing through crowded city streets, over rooftops etc, fantastic.    They don't, alas, make Bond movies like this any more.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|This movie was very well-done. It's the kind of thing that can't be out dated even though it's sci-fi. All the actors did a great job and it was creative as well as entertaining to watch.
B000RGSOR8|5.0|I've followed Annie's career for several years and this is her best work yet. This is not Avril Lagvigne's cutesy pop. If that is what you want, then pass on this disc. Annie has blended a huge number of influences and distilled them into something truly unique. Her sound can't just be compared to 1 or 2 or 10 different artists. It is deep and complex yet simple and pure. This music for musicians and you will hear something new every time you listen. 5 Stars.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I bought Supernatural without ever having seen an episode (I probably caught a few seconds once). My teenage daughter got tired of waiting for me to watch it with her. She loves horror movies so I knew she would be very interested in Supernatural. She has watched season 1 twice already. She said it is very intriguing and terrifying. Can't wait for season 2. I had better start catching up.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Intriguingly inviting story and superbly acted. Georgie Henley played a most convincing role of young Jane Eyre. As well as Ruth Wilson and other main characters. Although the only disturbance I had with this film was that it dismissed Jane's turn of heart towards God when she falls in love with Edward Rochester. Jane begins to let her emotions for Edward become a priority instead of God. The book clearly states that and it signifies a foreshadow to what kind of man Jane really falls in love with. If they had put that in and showed Jane's faithfulness to God in the beginning you'd understand why she said the LORD's prayer in the middle of the film. Also, they didn't accentuate Edward's repentence enough. He's so screwed up and such a sinner that when he repents and asks for God's forgiveness you feel a sense of happiness for him, but they summed it up in a few words. Not really moving, if you ask me. Other than that, I think it very well played and written.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I THINK THIS IS ONE OF HER BEST ALBUMS. SHE REALLY SHOWS HER VERSITILITY ON THIS ONE. I CAN LISTEN TO ALMOST THE ENTIRE ALBUM AND WHEN YOU CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW ITS WORTH GETTING
B000OQF6N6|5.0|This Smashing Pumpkins is well worth your money. If you like all of their music this cd is the best. I liked every song on this cd. My fav is<br />United States. Go out and get yours today!<br />Misty
B000OLGCHA|4.0|Never having heard Nicholas Hooper's work, like so many other \\"Potter\\" fans I was unsure of what to expect.  I found Patrick Doyle's music for \\"Goblet\\" woefully uninteresting, and was a little apprehensive about another Williams-less score.  And while no-one can come close to Williams for melodic invention and drama, Hooper's work is a vast improvement over Doyle's.  I too find the electric guitar in Track One a little jarring, but in every other respect, Hooper's speaking the same musical language Williams established in the first three films.  Some of his themes are particularly evocative, including \\"Dumbledore's Army,\\" \\"The Ministry of Magic\\" and \\"Professor Umbridge,\\" which skillfully manages to evoke both her fussiness and villainy.  So you can all breathe a little easier; the music has returned to Hogwarts.
B000002H2H|5.0|I do own this album.  I bought it on CD and cassette back when they were released.  And to this day, this is one of their best albums.  It's just too bad that they they all had to turn into a bunch of a-holes and sign on to be monkey boys for the RIAA, suing children and P2P networks.
0143038419|5.0|This was one of the most enjoyable books I ever read. If you love travel and self growth, you will enjoy this book. It's a great book for a summer vacation.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I finally saw this film. Since I am fluent in German, I didn't need the subtitles. What a film!! Previous reviewers already talked plenty about the story, so there is no need to go into this any further. Movies like this one are very rare. Although there are no car chases, no explicit sex, no explicit violence there is plenty on the human experience. Suffice it to say, my husband and I left the theater silently. It took us a while before we started talking about the various scenes. Since my husband left a communist country many years ago, he felt even more strongly about the truths of this film than I did. I would say this is a must for anybody who is sick and tired of the usual Hollywood fare.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|At Richmond High (CA) only 50% of students will graduate and students are 80% more likely to go to prison than college. In 1999 Ken Carter, who held school basketball records from his attendance there, takes a barely paid coaching position. This movie is based on that true story.<br /><br />The story moves quickly, beginning with Ken Carter watching his son's basketball game and afterward talks to the coach of the Richmond team about taking the job. The plot is well known, so I will tell you why I liked this movie besides the real life drama.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson is a wonderful actor and this has been regarded as one of his best performances. He conveys emotion well without being flamboyant, and he acts like a real coach. No boy on the team stands out as being a superstar or morally superior - Coach Carter's son plays on the team but is not favored or given more screen time. The plot doesn't lag and even though the movie is 136 minutes, you don't get bored.<br /><br />I highly recommend renting or buying this movie.
B000PWQOBC|5.0|This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Ozzy Osbourne's best album is simply a work of art! Very beautifully designed with all the lyrics included and with a sound quality remastered to perfection.       This is by far the best version of this album that is out there; great sound quality, great packaging, great songs! A must have in any CD collector's library.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|I only listened to the sample tracks but from what I've heard, I will not buy the album because...    Kelly has two types of songs on her album:  1. fast,yelling angsty (tracks 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,12)  2. slow, moaning angsty (4,8,9,11)    I like Irvine - has a different vibe. Otherwise, all the songs sound the same to me.    Not bad for a first attempt at writing some of her own songs.  But they aren't good enough.  Just because she has the fame doesn't mean she can use her career as anger management.  All her songs sound like they are in the same key, as well. Her second album is still her best.
1594489505|5.0|As you can see from the other reviews, this is one of those up until 2 in the morning, can't put it down books. I actually enjoyed this more than the Kite Runner and I think it was because I felt much more emotionally connected with the characters. Highly recommended.
1400063515|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Taleb's Black Swan. Much more than I enjoyed Fooled by Randomness. The key takeaway is that extreme events are not to be mathematically predicted because:  a. they are not as infrequent as statistical distributions expect them to be  b. they often tend to have extreme impacts on the worlds we live and work in    While the broad sentiment professed by Taleb, that everything in life does not follow a bell-curve, makes sense - I am less impressed by Taleb's diatribe against using any form of statistical distributions in general. I guess Taleb found it necessary to take an extreme position for his own very good reasons, but I would have taken a slightly more balanced view, all said and done.    Another valuable insight that is worthwhile for all of us readers to remember (it's nothing new) is the opportunity knocks only once. And therefore, take full advantage of any opportunity presented. This message gets lost in the overall theme and tone of the book, but is the most valuable takeaway for me.
B0002DB50E|5.0|Leave it to Canadian horror maven Cronenberg to concoct a bizarre but intelligent paranoid chiller involving televisual mind-control, sadomasochism, and a mysterious leader named Brian O'Blivion. Cronenberg's cunning black wit and obsession with technology and flesh are in ample evidence, as we're treated to throbbing TV screens, oozing gadgets, and gruesome images of body horror. Woods is impeccable playing a man whose fetishes and voyeuristic tendencies in some ways mirror our own. Blondie singer Deborah Harry is also surprisingly strong as Renn's kinky girlfriend. Offering pointed lessons for a culture even more besotted with images of sex and violence today, \\"Videodrome\\" is a disturbing fable about the breakdown of reality in the media age.
0446615625|2.0|When I first started the book I thought it was interesting.  I thought the characters were decent. Most of the  secret service protocol stuff and how the president travels is accuarte. Baldacci knows his stuff or it seems anyways but the book becomes a B movie you see on Showtime. The president travels with a thirty car motorcade with some of the most sophisticated communication and weapon arsenal fathomable. Theres no way ever terroists could accomplish whats accomplised in the book. Besides the 4 suburbans of secret service agents, personal militia, snipers, air support and everything else theres backup in case something like this happened. It was entertaining but unrealistic. i thought Oliver Stone and the camel club were great but even Stones back story is still hidden within the text. I found myself getting lost at murder mountain trying to keep up with the circus atmosphere. I wouldnt have even blinked if Baldacci mentioned clowns on stilts kidnapping the president. The author had me fooled from the beginning. The book was too long and drawn out with sub par dialogue. Still enjoyable but could have been a lot better with less words and characters.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Oliver Stone's poisonous ode to the \\"the go, go `80s\\" hinges on Michael Douglas's bravura, Oscar-winning portrayal of Gekko, seemingly a composite of Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, whose mantra \\"greed is good\\" justifies any means to execute the big deal, including insider trading. Subtle it's not, but then neither was the time, nor its players. Director Stone (whose father was a broker) expertly evokes the dizzying altitude of the mega-wealthy, and young Sheen is perfectly cast as a misguided but willing pawn in a high-stakes game that feels too good to be true--and is. And truly, Douglas was never better.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|much better album than lamb, imo. More sythenic and current, more confident. She doesn't seem as nervous and unsure of herself on this one. Of course this isn't in the same league as her stuff with no doubt. Don't even bother if you want another return of saturn, but you should have learned that the first time around. This is supposed to be a fun, guilty pleasure.     Of course it does come across as a bit calculating and jerky. It has plenty of variety. It's just fun, dumb pop music. Excellently done dumb pop music. And it sure beats Fergie.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Long before Arnold had a gubernatorial gleam in his eye, he starred as a hulking, monotone killing machine in this electrifying sci-fi action thriller by \\"Titanic\\" director Cameron. Popping off some of the most famous one-liners in film history (\\"Hasta la vista, baby!\\"), Schwarzenegger is both frightening and funny, even as he brutally destroys anyone who interferes with his mission. Hamilton and Biehn handle their roles splendidly too, with credible intensity, fear, and against-all-odds resolve. Full of dazzling special effects and far better than its buffed-up sequels, \\"The Terminator\\" is a hellish, suspense-fueled fun ride into the future.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I fell in love with Norman at precisely the moment Beatrix fell in love with him, when they were dancing and he was singing.   If I thought the CD of the soundtrack of this film included Ewan McGregor singing (for just a few minutes) \\"Let Me Teach You How To Dance\\" I would buy it in a heartbeat.  And a reminder, if you are prone to skip the credits at the end of films -- don't do it here.   The song \\"When I Taught You How To Dance\\" that plays at the end of the credits is enchanting.
6305922756|5.0|Brilliantly parodying the bloated excesses of the rock lifestyle, and gently poking fun at Martin Scorsese's \\"The Last Waltz,\\" director Rob Reiner invented a new genre--the \\"mockumentary\\"--with this gut-busting 1984 spoof. Not enough can be said about the comedic talents of Guest, McKean, and Shearer, whose outrageous songwriting (\\"Big Bottom Girls,\\" \\"Stonehenge\\") and improvisational dialogue (\\"Wot's wrong with being sexy?\\") are so convincing that many viewers thought Spinal Tap was a real act. Seen once or 30 times, \\"Spinal Tap\\" is relentlessly, ingeniously funny.
B000008HPE|5.0|The title was ideal for Huey Lewis & The News' fourth overall album despite the golf term. This album was preceded by the band's 1980 self-titled debut,1982's PICTURE THIS and the Grammy-winning SPORTS,released in late '83 or early '84. The band garnered more Grammys with the hits JACOB'S LADDER(written or co-written by Bruce Hornsby),STUCK WITH YOU,DOING IT ALL FOR MY BABY,HIP TO BE SQUARE and I KNOW WHAT I LIKE. The success of this album lasted for a year,from its summer 1986 release thru the following summer! In the photo,one of the \\"Newsmen\\" holds a miniature golf club. Unfortunately,the 1988 follow-up SMALL WORLD didn't win any Grammys but spawned two Top 20 hits. The band was then dropped from the Chrysalis label,which was extinct since 1990 and they moved to EMI-Manhattan.
B000F8O35U|5.0|A triumphant return to the hand-drawn Disney classics of old, the effervescent \\"Mermaid\\" is a sparkling mix of superb voice acting, energetic animation, and a highly infectious songbook, all loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen story. As voiced by Sam Wright, Sebastian the Crab is a particularly inspired entry in the studio's canon of irresistible helpmates, while Ashman and Menken songs like \\"Kiss the Girl\\" and the Oscar-winning \\"Under the Sea\\" will have you humming to the beach and back. \\"Mermaid\\" is a fun, intoxicating Atlantic fantasia for every size minnow in your splash-happy household.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|A good movie, but unfortunately you could see the \\"twist\\" from a mile away.<br /><br />I see a lot of comments about the reviewers having \\"spoiled\\" the plot for viewers, but sadly, the opening scene, coupled with the first few minutes of flashback sequence already gives a very good idea of what's about to happen. And halfway through the movies you know for SURE what the ending is. This \\"foresight\\" gets even stronger if you happened to read the 2 line plot synopsis, then you dont even need to watch the first few minutes of the opening sequence, just the very first scene of Eisenheim getting arrested for a seance (did i spell that correct?) is enough. The reviewers here are not the spoilers, the director of the movie is.<br /><br />Nothing is gained by narrating most of the story in flashback, so I wonder why the director chose to go that route. If the movie had been shown as a sequence of current events rather than flashback (or at the very least, the very first scene of the arrest was not shown), then the director could have kept us in the dark for at least half the movie. As it happens, we already know what is going to happen in the end, only thing remains to be seen is HOW.. the modalities, the details, which didnt turn out to be that impressive after all.<br /><br />I still give this movie 4 stars, since despite this glaring fault, it still manages to captivate the audience. The set designs, the costumes, the overall atmosphere is first grade and immersive. The performances from Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell are impressive, and the music is subtle but effective. You really do feel like you are a part of 1900's Vienna. The narration is brisk paced, and even though you know the ending, you never glance at your wristwatch, always a good sign... :-)<br /><br />Overall, I would recommed this movie.. just dont expect some awesome revelation at the end.
B00007AJGH|5.0|On release, Robert Zemeckis's colorful, thrilling joy-ride broke new ground in the merging of live action and cartoons, but what keeps this movie special is its manic pacing and goofy, anarchic spirit. The film is so dazzling that adults and children alike will quickly fall under its hyperkinetic spell, and come back to staid reality only with the closing credits. Populated by a host of cartoon characters, familiar and unfamiliar, the film is also a tribute to movies, and the private eye genre in particular. A blast.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|A child of the 80s, Miami Vice was THE show.  Weeks prior to this release, before I even knew about the movie, I had just purchased season one on DVD and had been watching a Miami Vice marathon on some cable channel.  So I was pretty geared up for the film, primarily because it was to be directed by Michael Mann, the original show's creator.    Saw it the opening weekend and was disappointed.  Other than the names and the setting, it wasn't what I expected.  And that was the problem.  The television show this isn't.  And that is the movie's strength.  It is much more atmospheric, much darker and much more slick.    I'm not sure how someone who was unfamiliar with the show would feel about the character development.  From the point of view of someone who knew the show, there is minimal character development in the movie.  Granted, two hours isn't much time.  But you get a lot of attitude, a lot of cool and a lot of action.  Just don't expect too much depth.    But Mann's characteristic style, mood and imagery blazes off the screen.    Dark, moody, fast paced, it's eye candy with a rocking score.  From techno (Moby) to ambient metal (Mogwai), the music buoys the film almost perfectly.      Though not without its weaknesses, watch it for what it is - visual and aural delight.  I'm glad I took a second look.
0790729342|5.0|Technically a sequel to Australian director George Miller's \\"Mad Max,\\" this gripping, hyperkinetic sci-fi action film not only stands on its own, but actually throttles past its predecessor. Gibson, reprising his role as Max, is all nerve and bone as the rugged, laconic loner, and his visceral performance has star power written all over it. In supporting roles, Emil Minty is touching as Max's feral-child sidekick, while Kjell Nilsson is unforgettably fearsome as tribal leader Humungus. Miller's \\"Road Warrior\\" is one long adrenaline rush, epitomized in the climactic scene involving a band of crazed villains pursuing an oil tanker at breakneck speed.
0439796636|5.0|Michael Morpurgo's WAR HORSE tells of war horse Joey, who began life as a farm horse with a gentle boy master and was sold into the army during World War I. Fans of Black Beauty and other classic animal stories will find this first-person horse's eye story of war and change brings to dramatic life all the conflicts and struggles of battle.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|At least now it can be said that Josh Homme and Queens can make a five star record without Nick Oliveri.  Following Nick's departure from the band, Queens released Lullabies to Paralyze, a great record that, unfortunately, seemed only to emphasize that Oliveri was not there, from the not so subtle lyrical jabs in \\"Everybody Knows That You're Insane\\" to increased prevalence of slowed down grooves and blues, with often exceedingly slick production.  Sure, the drawn out psychedelic riffs had been a QOTSA trademark from day one, but the lack of ANY punk/speed metal counterpoint was a constant, sad reminder that we were never going to hear \\"Millionaire\\" live again.  Lullabies was a great record with unavoidable, bittersweet timing.    Years later many of us have gotten used to Queens without Nick, and appropriately Josh and company have unleashed a perfect record for this particular place in their career.  Enough to remind of us of the good old days, and enough new stuff to remind us why this is one of the most inventive groups in rock.  The production is rawer and more lo-fi than everything since their debut.  The riffs are harder and the music is faster than on Lullabies.  Everything we used to love.  On the other hand, there's great stuff we haven't heard.  Spidery guitar lines weaving in and out on songs like I'm Designer and Turning on the Screw, and a composition (3's and 7's) which throws everything Queens has done well in their career into one incredibly catchy riff rock buffet for your repeated consumption.  Elsewhere, the album's two most powerful cuts, the murky \\"Suture up Your Future\\" and \\"Into the Hollow\\" show Josh having perfected his falsetto wail, and remind the listener of the difference between hard and heavy.  The combination of haunting grooves and emotional vocals on these 2 cuts are worth the price of admission alone.  And \\"Make it Wit Chu,\\" another Desert Sessions redux, is no-frills classic rock that is as simple and honest as the original seventies soul and funk it is imitating.  Lyrically, Josh continues to make strides.  He's come along way since the days when \\"marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol\\" was known as his most legendary turn of phrase.  In \\"I'm Designer\\" he toes the fine line between comedy and commentary ever so well, all while singing the verses in a rhythmic pattern I can only describe as \\"crazy homeless bluesman meter\\" that reminds you everything he does is at least a little bit tongue in cheek.    With a few exceptions, almost of all this release is excellent, and it continues to reveal new layers to me each time I pop it in.  And quite honestly this is probably the most rewarding aspect of Era Vulgaris.  It lacks the irreplicable manic presence of Oliveri both musically and lyrically, but makes up for it with musical ingenuity Lullabies only hinted at.  Whether you prefer Rated R or Songs for the Deaf as the definitive QOTSA statement, this is probably their second best album.
B00005JPFF|2.0|I guess I shouldn't be surprised at so many rave reviews for this movie, but I thought it was a real let-down. One reviewer asks us to \\"let down our expectations.\\" Why? Why shouldn't I expect the same quality that the folks used for the first two? It isn't as if they don't have the time, money, or skills - not to mention forty years of comic books to browse for story lines. If anything I should keep my expectations high all the time. Why do we get crappy films? Because we have lowered expectations, that's why.<br />This movie has too many bad guys, too much of a downright silly plot, shameful under utilization of entertaining characters (J.J.J.) in favor of smarmy ones (Eddie Brock/Venom) and veers back and forth between parody and seriousness to utter distraction. Perhaps the worst offense is that by the end of the movie, you just don't care about Peter Parker/Spider-Man. What a shame.<br />In addition, this movie was a drag because it lacked any good action sequences, and for that matter, not enough action sequences period and it had WAY too much drama. The fight scenes were so fast and so hard to follow that I found myself wondering what was going on and the drama was so contrived and cliched that I simply didn't care. It is indeed a long fall from the spectacular train fight sequence and the simple agonizing romance of Peter and M.J. in the second movie to the nauseating action and embarassingly maudlin scenes in this film.<br />I truly hope that they either stop this series now or go back to the first two movies and really study what made them so good. This is NOT the best in the series, in fact it is by far the worst. As a matter of fact, I thought Ghost Rider was better. Does that tell you something?
B000JK8OYU|5.0|SO I purchased, Love on Amazon<br />I love this album, still.<br />I wish there was more of black bird and dear Prudence.<br />Other wise fun little take along to the park...
B000OVLBF8|2.0|Ghost Rider isn't as bad as some of the movie versions of Marvel Comics, but it isn't a very interesting plot and the characters are very flat. There are good actions sequences and the special effects are well done but they aren't enough to keep the moving from slowing down in parts. As for the acting, Nicolas Cage is pretty wooden and Eva Mendes does little more than show off her cleavage. For a cheap movie rental, it is entertaining enough, but I wouldn't want to buy it.<br />Two final things - I considered taking my kids to see this, the youngest of whom is 10. I am glad I didn't. Yes, I understand that the rating is PG-13, but most parents assume that PG-13 isn't so bad. In this case, I am a bit surprised. The movie is continual frightening imagery and I would warn parents of pre-teens to have a look yourself beforehand. From one parent to another it is something to consider.<br />Secondly, during the special features documentary there is a part where the costume designer describes how she made risky back-room deals in Thailand in order to procure rare sea creature skins for the costumes including shark and sting-ray. I found her giddy attitude about making these illegal and rather unnecessary purchases to be wildly inappropriate. Her Hollywood mentality puts her frighteningly out-of-touch with the criminal and immoral world of animal trade. She acted like a teenager who'd stolen a pair of flip-flops from Wal-Mart instead of an adult who enabled the slaughter of animals for their skin, especially when you consider that no one would've known or cared what the costumes were made of outside of her small cadre of colleagues and that avoiding animal skin by using other materials would've been easy and more cost-effective. It was a shameless act of irresponsibility and excessiveness. What a sad statement.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Like all of Michael Moore's films, he's out to expose the bad guy. Scratch that, he's out to answer questions nobody wants to ask about the bad guy. And then everyone scratches their heads wondering why they never asked those questions either. In Bowling for Columbine, Moore questions the American obsession with guns and how they ultimately interacted with disaffected youth. In Fahrenheit 911, Moore questions the nation's sanity in electing George W. Bush and then giving him the mandate for war. And now, with his new film Sicko, Michael Moore tackles the next elephant in the room: the American health care system.<br /><br />Sure, we've all paid high premiums. We've all paid high deductibles, prescription costs, doctor co-pays, etc -- and some of us even pay out of pocket when we can't afford health insurance. But so what? That's just the way it is, and that's the way health insurance has always been...Right? Wrong, says Moore. Perhaps we've become so accustom to the American system that we accept it as being natural and a necessary evil. After all, we are the richest, most powerful nation in the world. Of course we have the best health insurance money can buy, right? After all, what do my high premiums and deductibles pay for? Surprise, surprise, says Moore. The only thing they pay for is more Insurance Company profits, and less care for you and you're family. But not to fear, says Moore, there actually is another way of managing health care, and several modern, democratic nations do it everyday...and they do it well. Enter stage left - Socialized Health Care (also called Universal Health Care, or National Health Care depending on your political leanings).<br /><br />Yes, the evil word: Socialized -- Socialist. It's been grilled into us for most of the 20th century. Anything socialized is bad. It naturally leads to communism, economic depravity, and the downfall of man...blah, blah, blah. Well, Michael Moore wisely points out, that we already socialize many institutions: the Fire Department, the Police Department, the Library, the Postal Service, the Public School System, etc. - FREE services that we wouldn't think of paying for out of pocket. FREE services that we liken to liberty itself. Yes, we Americans are practicing Socialists already! Quick, rally the troops! The Red Scare is at our doorstep! Your postman and the librarian are organizing Marxist rallies as we speak!<br /><br />Ok, hold on. If we already socialize some of the more important, and fundamental services of our society, and we haven't fallen into Chairman Mao's Red Grip, then we can at least begin to examine why we are 37th on the list of top health care nations in the world - just above Slovenia. I'm not kidding! The country that invented the light bulb, saved Europe in WWII, and put a man on the moon comes in 37th...after Slovenia?? How ashamed and disgusted am I? Answer: very.<br /><br />And so, Michael Moore's record of travesty after travesty of the American health care system rolls on for a clean 113 minutes on the screen. And the results are in:<br /><br />England: NOBODY pays a cent for even the most expensive health care services and products.<br /><br />Canada: NOBODY pays.<br /><br />France: NOBODY pays.<br /><br />Cuba: NOBODY pays.<br /><br />Cuba, for goodness sakes! The Evil Empire itself! Michael Moore even went so fare as to take some 911 volunteer workers down to Cuba where they received service and attention they couldn't get in America. 911 volunteers!! So much for rewarding our heroes.<br /><br />Will this film create a stir in the nation? It better. Will it last? I pray it will, but knowing the American attention span - especially for things that really matter - it's unlikely to last until the 2008 elections when it will really matter. And before anyone goes off saying Michael Moore has set off yet again for another one of his America-bashing tirades he calls \\"documentary,\\" they need to honestly examine what he's saying in this film. He's not saying America-bad, Europe and Canada-good - he's just stating the obvious: we in the States have got it all wrong, and we're paying with our lives and our health - the only things we truly possess in this world. Isn't that worth a measly $10 at the box office and some political pressure? If not, then I'm moving to France. Take that Freedom Fries!e obvious: we in the States have got it all wrong, and we're paying with our lives and our health - the only things we truly possess in this world. Isn't that worth a measly $10 at the box office and some political pressure? If not, then I'm moving to France. Take that Freedom Fries!
B000N4SHOE|4.0|Though not a big fan of the Peter Rabbit on the plates and cards myself, Miss Potter the movie has turned the static images of Peter Rabbit and his friends into some lively, beautiful artwork that leapt from the pages through animation.     Renee Zellweger is an excellent choice for Miss Potter - she deliberately molded her face into that of the rabbit. Despite her sweet oulook and strict upbringing, she had a mind of her own and a wonderful taste of art and beauty. Not to mention her shrewd business sense and her passion for nature and botany.     Miss Potter the illustrator did not belong to the old ages - she was a pioneer, a woman of action and conservationist. The movie, despite or because of its lack of action, portrayed the serene English countryside just the way it is. This is a biography of a respectable lady. At some stage quite tragic when she lost her first love. But seeing that she did not falter and lose her cause, she emerged a sucessful figure who made a genuine and lasting difference to her beloved countryside. Quite a woman!

B000OQF6N6|5.0|I am so happy that these guys are back. I have been a huge fan of them for years! The standout tracks: Doomsday Clock, That's The Way (My Love Is), United States, Tarantua, and the bonus track from Target (the title track)    All the songs are listenable. Very good purchase. You will not regret it!
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Batman Returns is a classic movie.  It has great effects, wonderful acting, cool photography, a fantastic score, and is directed by the greatest director of our time.  I dont know if this is Burtons best movie as a director, but its certainly worth more than five stars.  The film has aged so well and still looks absolutely gorgeous.  The film is so dark and moody.  I love it.  Batman has always been one of the more darker heroes, this film really captures that.  I cant stand when people say that Batman isnt hardly in the film.  I agree with Tim Burton who says that Batman is meant to be more hidden.  Dont let those opinions stop you from watching this true work of art.  The film also has some great action scenes and a good chemistry between the actors.  Its quite hard to describe how incredible the film is.  I cant see how the original can ever be said to be better than this.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect from the new album...I was just hoping it had some good tracks.  Luckily, the album has exceeded my expectations.    Billy is in top form, his top-notch songwriting skills are on display throughout the album.  Several of these songs are destined to become fan classics, including: Bleeding the Orchid, United States, For God and Country, and the new single, Tarantula.    Jimmy Chamberlin is given room to shine on nearly every track.  Chamberlin, now the band's not-so-secret weapon, pushes the music into new directions.  His drum tracks are now pushed to the forefront of the songs, highlighting his amazing skill.    Overall an interesting continuation from Machina/Machina II.  Each track demands repeat listens.  Corgan has created another truly unique album, that may leave some scratching their heads at first.  But it only takes a few listens to grasp the album's raw power and overall brilliance.    This album is not an attempt to re-create the Pumpkins sound, if there is such a thing.  It's like every other SP album, a step forward.  Billy decided to step forward with hard-hitting songs, but maintaining the band's ever-present beautiful subtleties.    The Smashing Pumpkins haven't missed a beat.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|As a Moslem, I have to say that this movie is very accurate and objective. I am deeply satisfy with this one, because I like Crusade (Jihad Fisabilillah) movies. Some Christians are affraid for their own histories which is covered by darkness.   A Movie like this one is a break-trough and it is suppose to be a patron for any kind of religious movies.   Therefore, Ridley Scott is a water-carrier on the Endless Desert.  \\"There can be no victory except trough God\\"
B00005JNEI|5.0|The guys a documentary genius.  I don't like some of the ambush tactics he uses in his films, but never-the-less, he's usually dead on.  Those who love him and those who hate him can argue all day long, but he's yet to lose a libel suit.  If you haven't seen this film before, or since the war started, check out a copy.  It's more on the mark today in reflection than it even was during it's release.  Too bad the news is so controlled today, otherwise they'd be running Bush out of town for all the lies and damage he's done to this country and it's security.  Of course if you are one of the 17% remaining with W's on your car that are still looking under rocks for WMD and think that W can walk on water, than this one is not for you, or your blook pressure.  Check out Sicko while you are at it.  Everyone can agree what a mess our health care is, and Sicko will make you sick at how Washington does nothing while people suffer.
0618871713|5.0|I have seen this book for a while at a local book store.  I finally bought the book and in one sitting read the whole thing. This is the best memoir I have read in a long time.  Allison Bechdel has created something very special.  The book focuses in her relationship with her fathe and the similarites that come about after her father's death.  This is a book I will and would recommend to anyone.  As time passes this is a book I will re=read again and again.  Thoughtful, honest, exhilerating.
186049692X|4.0|Having enjoyed Waters' TIPPING THE VELVET, I brought AFFINITY along on vacation (mostly, I'll admit, because it was one of the few paperbacks I had handy and wanted to travel light!).  What a wonderful read!  Set in the late 19th Century, this book captured me from the start with page-turning prose not often found in current writers.  Waters' prose reads like Daphne Du Maurier's - musically poetic yet abundantly understandable.  This is the (fictional) story of Margaret Prior - a woman of means in 19th C. England who, because she's at odds with Victorian society, becomes involved with an emprisoned psychic spiritualist.  I won't spoil the plot, but suffice it to say there are many twists and turns!    This book evolved in a way that left me feeling I was hands of an adept writer.  I was, quite simply, engrossed.
B000068OCS|3.0|Koyaanisqatsi (Godfrey Reggio, 1983)<br /><br />I've been waiting over twenty years to see Koyaanisqatsi, and now I finally have. From what I've been reading, I get the idea that perhaps I should have held out for a big-screen showing (or an IMAX showing, since it seems there's a grass-roots movement for an IMAX translation); I keep hearing that it loses a lot in translation, and I can see that. It's a movie that's full of sweeping landscapes, brilliant cinematography, and the kind of soundtrack that begs to be heard on the kind of half-million-dollar sound system you find in upscale movie houses. That, however, is not to say that renting the DVD will not give you any sense of those things; like most lost-in-translation cases, what's really missing here is the majesty of the thing. The basic idea still comes through loud and clear. And I'll tell you right now--despite having no actors, no script, no real structure (Reggio cut and pasted the movie together according to the way Philip Glass had structured his awe-inspiring soundtrack)--Koyyanisqatsi is an unabashed message movie, and a great deal of whether you like it or not will depend on your reaction to its message. Those of you who know me, and know anything about Koyyanisqatsi, can probably recite the rest of this review in your head without actually having to read it.<br /><br />In short: Koyyanisqatsi is beautiful, beautiful propaganda. Looking at it a full quarter century after its release, my first thought was, in all honesty, \\"what makes this different than the kinds of movies you see in museums and the like?\\" (cf. Sedona: The Spirit of Wonder.) The answer becomes obvious about ten minutes into the film: it's the quality of Ron Fricke (Baraka)'s incredible camerawork. (Remember that this was Fricke's first feature-length project, and it's even more impressive.) It takes about ten minutes because the first section of any substance in the film takes that long to show up; the first sequence is basic shots of the same natural wonders we've seen a thousand times (in fact, IMDB reports in its trivia section that one of the mountain scenes was \\"leftover footage\\" from Kubrick's The Shining). Now, I know a lot of people are going to criticize that statement, because it means I missed the point of that sequence. No, I didn't miss the point. If you want to show the majesty and grandeur of nature, there are certainly better ways to do it than showing stock footage, especially when you've got Ron Fricke doing your cinematography. I mean, come on, is there any American-made Western from the fifties and sixties that doesn't have grand, sweeping pans of red rock country?<br /><br />Then we get to human beings scurrying over the landscape like tool-using ants, and we get to the body of Fricke's footage (there are still some stock shots interspersed, but they don't take up as much room). What you see in these pictures will depend entirely on your viewpoint coming into the film. Is the scene of two policemen and some EMTs lifting a passed out (or dead) man onto a stretcher in New York City a scene conveying the horrors of humanity (in the dead man), or a scene of professional servicepeople admirably doing their jobs? How about the scene of a (presumably) husband and wife eating a meal, sitting at a table in a mall food court, while people stream around them? While it's filmed in the same fast-motion as many of the other human scenes, are they part of the problem, or an island of calm? Or, earlier on, a scene of a fight pilot standing in front of his plane. You can tell from the scenes that surround this one that we're supposed to view this man and his instrument of destruction with horror. But how does that scan with the brave, slightly humble look on his face?<br /><br />Simple: it doesn't, unless you're willing to work the edges a little to get the piece to fit into the hole.<br /><br />The fact that Koyyanisqatsi is slanted should be obvious even to the most idealistic devotee of thefilm. To be fair (and to address my points above), it's probably less so than any fictional environmentalist movie I've seen (I'm thinking specifically of Prophecy here--Frankenheimer's '79 ecomonster flick, not the Walken/Mortensen fallen-angel amusement). It leaves more room for interpretation, though I'm assuming that its target audience mostly has a `preaching to the choir' mindset. All this by way of saying that even if you're a member of the pave-the-earth society, there are a lot of pretty pictures here, Philip Glass' soundtrack is as wonderful as the rest of Glass' work, and you might come up with some interesting points when debating the fanatics. Recommended, though I'm not sure it would stand up to a long series of repeated rewatches. ***nts above), it's probably less so than any fictional environmentalist movie I've seen (I'm thinking specifically of Prophecy here--Frankenheimer's '79 ecomonster flick, not the Walken/Mortensen fallen-angel amusement).

B00008L3U1|5.0|This is a good movie to instill compassion.  We need to be reminded in an optimistic manner that we are not all alike and that each has their own thing to deal with in this life.  It is not a free ride but it can be a beautiful ride.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I am soooo frustrated!!  In the film, what is the name of the piano ballad that is played when Billy is alone at the dance bar with Mrs. Wilkinson and they are rehearsing?  (This is after the scene where Billy has imagined his mother in the kitchen).  I have been searching for this song for years!  Why oh why did they not include ALL OF THE SONGS from the movie on this sound track?  Please help!  Thanks in advance.
B000MZHW4A|5.0|Leonardo is spectacular in this movie.  It deserved every award it got, and probably many it didn't.  The plot is fast-moving, it's heart-breaking and joyful, though mostly the former.  It's fascinating to learn a little bit about Africa.  I recommend this movie without reservations; it's one of the few I'd purchase full price.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|At 23 years old I am not your typical Bobhead, I own all 30+ Dylan albums including bootlegs. I have been to several Dylan concerts over the last few years. Dylan has come out with 3 studio albums the last 10 years all critical successes. With Modern Times Dylan was the oldest artist to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Out of the three this is my least favorite. I loved Love and Theft and liked Time Out of Mind. Love & Theft was loud, funny and all around great. Time Out of Mind was a little depressing but had amazing lyrics. Modern Times is a mix between the two albums. To be completely honest I only liked three songs on this album: Thunder on the Mountain, Spirit on the Water and Workingman Blues #2. Someday Baby gets better with every listen so maybe I will put that one on there too. But who cares? It's Dylan....get the cd already.
B00000F5KH|5.0|I saw this film at the Astor in Melbourne a number of years ago - a grand art deco art-house theatre with a big screen and fantastic choctops.  I entered the theatre with no expectations and exited having been blown away.    It is so not a Hollywood film - there is no lead male role (aside from Josue), there is no simple happy ending, and Fernando Montenegra allows herself as Dora to be thoroughly unattractive.    In the film, we see the seething mass of humanity of Rio, the cheapness of life, the uncompromising harshness of the environment.    But what sets this film apart is the performances.  Fernando Montenegra is extraordinary as Dora - at times nasty, but through a flicker of an eye, a quiver of a lip, and clutch of her hands she drags you in, you compell yourself to invest your heart in her, willing her to win her battles with herself, knowing that any victories are likely to be small, and short-lived.  She should have got the oscar she was nominated for.    This is not to detract from Josue - to be honest, child actors normally make me cringe - but Josue's chemistry with Dora is fantastic - the spruiking scene at the pilgrim site is a classic.    So when it plays at the Astor every couple of years I always drag along a group and love seeing their faces - a mate of mine summed it up when he said \\"seeing Central Station, you realise how long it is since you've seen a truly great film\\".
B000MR9D5E|5.0|First off I am not usually into nature programs...they bore me to death. However this series is simply captivating with it's amazing images of our planet. Being a history and geography teacher I have seen my fair share of geography videos of fascinating locations, they all pale in comparison to the scope and detail of this documentary. Who should view this? Everyone who lives on this planet we call earth! Anyone who has kids between the ages of 8-15 will be especially fascinated in my opinion working with that age group on a day to day basis. You will watch it again and again and come to appreciate our planet and all that is in it on a much higher level than you ever have before.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Much better then what anyone expected - the Pumpkins are really back. Some songs seem to have a real combination of Billy's last works, such as Zwan and The Future Embrace. Really good, a must buy!
B000ETQRCM|4.0|First off I am a huge Pearl Jam fan, I own all their albums including many bootlegs. I was a little young during their hayday but like them better than than 99% of the stuff put out today. This album is the most consistently good album the band has ever but together. That being said it is still not my favorite. The songs are all solid, my favorites being Life Wasted, Marker in the Sand, Parachutes, Unemployable and Come Back. However no songs reach the heights of Vitalogy, Vs, or even Riot Act. I think those who like classic Pearl Jam like Ten or Vs should check this out.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Billy Corgan has been the primary song writer for the Smashing Pumpkins from the very beginning. With that said, its unfair to call this a glorified solo album. Smashing Pumpkins are no different than bands such as Nine Inch Nails, A Perfect Circle, Marilyn Manson, etc. Darcy left on her own terms for motherhood with the full support of the band. Iha had the opportunity to revive the legacy and play very influential songs under the monicre they all created, but chose not to reunite.  So we have Chamberlin and Corgan, and in 2007 have been able to finally create an album that captures both their youthish Gish with the later and more darker toned Machina... Jimmy's drumming is amazing with some interesting \\"sound capture\\" techniques that far surpass previous efforts even though they still rocked! If anything this album sounds more like the Pumpkins since MCIS and any true fan should embrace and be thankful for a new Pumpkins record!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Slightly more one-dimensional than past endeavors, \\"Zeitgeist\\" still holds it's own in the pumpkins catalog.  The absence of half of the original lineup no doubt contributes to the change in sound, but Billy and Jimmy channel the \\"Siamese Dream\\" sound and it works.  I would have liked this album a little more if it were less political; in today's music world, politics are such a reoccurring theme that political albums are almost becoming caricatures of themselves.  Anyway, I'd like to hear more of this sort of thing.  So I think everyone should support this release and get us one step closer to washing away all those bad memories of emo bands that won't get off the radio.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has captured a tiny portion of my soul in this work. If you have ever contemplated \\"What's missing inmy life?\\", Eat, Pray, Love may help you find an answer.  Witty yet profoundly serious, this book gently nudges us to explore the inner workings of ourselves. Scary places....  Even through we all can't live in an Ashram for 4 months, we can take time to explore our own lives and how we react to events.  Some key passages that are stuck with me:    Why talk so much? Listen more.  I must have the pizza in Naples.  My mind is a safe, deep harbor- I choose which thoughts to allow in  People are afraid  ...and many, many more.    Buy the book.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I'm tellin' ya this is one of the greatest true metal bands you will find (mainstream wise), next to Sevendust. My favorites on this are Surfacing, Wait and Bleed, Spit it Out, (sic), Eyeless, and Purity. In that order. I dont think there is much else to say, Just look at the average reviews, over 1,000 and its still above a 4 star rating.    So if you like Korn, Disturbed, Sevendust, Static-X, Rob Zombie, or Tool I dont see any reason at all you would not like this CD..
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Billy Corgan defied not only the odds but the critics as well in 2005 when he announced the reforming of the Smashing Pumpkins. As none of Corgan's projects had been successful since the break-up (see: Zwan), it seemed like a desperate career move from our bald-headed, heart-on-the-sleeve hero. All the more risky it became when it was announced, albeit unsurprisingly, that this version of the Pumpkins would just include Corgan and original drummer Jimmy Chamberlain in tow -- with some hired guns to help out for the live show. No James Iha or D'arcy Wretzky. So upon listening to the first Pumpkins album in seven years, it's quite shocking to hear how true to form it really is. Granted, this ain't the Pumpkins of the 90's, but if they had stuck together through the years, it's hard to imagine them putting out something as gripping as \\"Zeitgeist,\\" easily the most satisfying of the albums since \\"Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness.\\"<br /><br />Before the skeptics rip this album apart for being just another Corgan side-project, it is important to note that in 1993, a little known album by the name of \\"Siamese Dream\\" was released by the Pumpkins, which was mostly recorded by Billy Corgan himself -- with none other than Jimmy Chamberlain on drums. So, if anything, \\"Zeitgeist\\" is just as much a Pumpkins album as the rest of them. But petty arguments aside, it cannot be denied that Corgan has finally upped the ante on his music. Less spacey than either of the \\"Machina\\" albums and not as weird as \\"Adore,\\" \\"Zeitgeist\\" may very well be the doomiest and gloomiest of the Smashing Pumpkins canon. Songs like \\"Doomsday Clock,\\" \\"7 Shades Of Black\\" and \\"Tarantula\\" will rattle your bones with the intense rhythm section and wall of sound that we have come to expect from the Pumpkins but haven't been treated to in ages.<br /><br />Since it's 2007 and Corgan choses to stay relevant, \\"Zeitgeist\\" is a moderately political album. If the album cover, depicting the Statue Of Liberty drowning in a red sea wasn't enough of a hint, songs like \\"United States\\" and \\"For God And Country\\" don't beat around the bush with their subject matter. Thankfully, though, Billy isn't just riding the anti-Bush trend (not that there's anything wrong with that!) as there is plenty of classic Pumpkins material to balance it out. The catchy \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\" would make a fun hit single, while \\"That's The Way (My Love Is)\\" and \\"Neverlost\\" unleash those gorgeous melodies that only this band, and no one ever since, can bring. But the overall tone of the album is rather heavy and I think even the hardcore Smashing Pumpkins fan will be shocked at just how heavy and bold the new Pumpkins sound is. In all honesty, there's nothing bad about \\"Zeitgeist.\\" The complainers will continue to complain about the lack of a full reunion, and despite how good this album is, there will forever be people refusing to admit that. However, if you are open-minded enough, and let the past go, you might find \\"Zeitgeist\\" to be not only one of the best albums of the moment, but one of the Pumpkins' best as well.wasn't enough of a hint, songs like \\"United States\\" and \\"For God And Country\\" don't beat around the bush with their subject matter.

B000002U94|3.0|Nine Tonight is a very uninteresting live album.  It doesn't feel like Bob Seger went out of his way to make any of the songs exciting.  It's more like a feeling of Bob and the rest of the band going through the motions, or a feeling of \\"It's time to release a live album, and this is what we're giving you\\".  I don't believe the band was really feeling the excitement or the energy that made much of these songs sound so good in the studio.  If you happen to own these songs on their regular studio albums, you'd be better off avoiding this album altogether and just sticking with what you have.  Or better yet, look into some late 60's Bob Seger, which was the absolute high point of his career.
B000056TKC|5.0|I've read about it for years; so many people saying it's the greatest ever, but I always said: \\"Ach, I already have too many Beethoven Ninths\\". Well, I finally broke down and bought it.    Some random thoughts and things that caught my ear to which I found singular to this performance/recording:     -First off, the recording is fine remastered late-'50s stereo, but cannot be mistaken for modern digital. Strings and highs might seem a bit steely, but that didn't bother me. All orchestral sections are vividly portrayed. Fortissimos are crisp and distinct, pianissimos well-distinguishable. Recording perspective puts one on the podium with what sounds like a multi-mike arrangement; i.e., typical Deutsche Grammophon. However, the winds, brass, and tympani are treated as equals to the strings, unlike later with Karajan.     -The first movement pianissimo string tremolos are barely audible beneath that marvelous opening motif, as well as later when repeated. I'm used to hearing the tremolos more pronounced and would probably prefer it that way.     -The first movement builds and ebbs with great aplomb and the crescendos culminate with tympani blazing in the same fashion as Furtwängler/'42, though not quite as overwhelming as to drown the proceedings and rock the foundations, but you definitely know the tympani are there!     -The scherzo second movement offers a tempo which I'd describe as conventional, certainly slower that Karajan and perhaps faster than Böhm/'72. No problems there.     -I had never heard the cellos as pronounced in the second movement as on this recording. Loved it!     -The adagio third movement is beautifully and slowly rendered; the notes say 18:00. It's not nearly as expansive as Furtwängler/'42's 20:00, but certainly just as rapturous with instrumental details aplenty! Böhm/'72 took it faster, but not as memorably or affectedly. In Fricsay's third movement, the soft pizzicato strings are distinct and the sudden bursts of brass cut right to thesoul. This movement is often problematic for me, but not here. Beautiful!     -The dissonant beginning of the fourth movement sounds kind of wimpy, as if a chunk of the orchestration was excised. In fact, it's probably as wimpy as I ever remember hearing it in a non-HIP recording.  No big deal, however.     -The beginning of the \\"O freude, nicht diese Töne\\" is very powerful. The soloists are definitely highlighted, up-front, and \\"in your face\\" -- they are the stars of this show! The chorus is appropriately recessed, but recorded with powerful presence. It seems as if the chorus moved slightly forward in the sound picture as the movement progressed, then receded slightly again behind the soloists. No complaints here; it was so subtle that it might be a product of Fricsay's balancing from the podium and not engineering derring-do. The orchestra did seem to vie with the chorus for prominence, but so what, right?     -The soloists are so distinct that one can hear many fine individual flourishes in their ensemble singing -- loved it!    -The tempo of the choral movement shifts from foursquare forward, to almost a dead stop, then ignites again, driving to a coda that's brought home powerfully and convincingly. Everything is beautifully under control and not hell-bent-for-leather, so to speak.     My favorites over the years have been:   Schmidt-Isserstedt/Vienna Phil./London (Outstanding soloists!)   Böhm ('72)/Vienna Phil./DG (A magnificent, high calorie performance and grand sense of occasion!)  Karajan ('77)/Berlin Phil./DG (Better recording than his '63, but near equally great performance!)   Leibowitz/Royal Phil./Chesky (They put the \\"JOY\\" into Ode To Joy!)    Sure, I can add Fricsay to the list. I was never \\"overly\\" enamored with Szell, Toscanini, Wand, Muti, Klemperer, Bernstein, Dohnányi, Norrington, Goodman, and a few others, though they're all seemingly well-regarded by some and certainly have their fine points. I've yet to hear Reiner's or Solti's recordings, both with the Chicago Symphony and both with their fervent fans. Nor have I heard the renown Gardiner, Abbado, and Barenboim. I don't have to hear the Zinman/Tonhalle, not after hearing samples.    I've also yet to hear Furtwängler's famous '51 live performance at the post-war re-opening of the Bayreuth Festival which some people simply swear by. I tend to take event-driven hyberbole with a grain of salt, especially after hearing Bernstein's \\"Fall of the Wall\\" recording. Furtwängler's equally famous and harrowing '42 wartime recording simply must be placed in a special category on account of its comparatively wretched sound quality, if for no other reason than for the benefit of novice listeners.  However, I would also join those who suggest it's a performance that thoroughly demands to be heard.      The Fricsay is certainly a great recorded performance of the Ninth. The greatest ever? Hell, I don't know!  I would definitely say it's worth the purchase.  Whether it's worth the import price, however, is up to the individual.  I purchased mine used for about $10 plus S&H.    I should probably also mention that the CD opens with one of the most expansive performances of the Egmont Overture I've ever heard.

0060001941|5.0|After reading this book, I looked at the negative reviews to see what people could have possibly said was wrong with this book.  A few found it boring, some found it depressing.  I think these people did not give this book the proper attention it deserved.  Though \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is about the life of a poor girl in a poor neighborhood and a poor life, this is not what the book focuses on.  As you read the book, you are constantly reading about the beauty of the world around Francie Nolan, not the squalor.  Through most of the book, you see the world through the eyes of a young, imaginative, smart, innocent girl who does not have the \\"education\\" and \\"knowledge\\" to realize how terribly she has it.  You see the true love bonds between brother and sister, father and daughter, and between a mother and daughter who love each other despite their inability to understand one another.  Although it is true that there is some sorrow in this story, I found myself laughing much more often than I found myself crying.  The sad parts are not fun, but pain is in every good and realistic story.  The humor in everyday people and everyday life is what makes this book so enjoyable.  Each character has a specific personality with humorous and lovable quirks.  And the ending is worth the entire book.  I finished this book feeling so wonderful about every aspect of my life.  It is not a completely happy ending, but it is a very satisfying one.  I would recommend this book to any girl or woman and I would recommend that everyone else should give it an honest chance too.

B00005JLR8|5.0|The more I watch this beautiful film the deeper I'm touched by its grace and elegance.  It's one of the more impressionable films to come out in quite some time, and it truly deserves a wider audience.  `In America' was actually recommended to us shortly after my wife became pregnant with our first child.  We were told it was a film that would really help you appreciate a parent's love for their children.  That said, my wife and I couldn't make it through the film with dry eyes, and even now we still tear up when we watch this movie.  `In America' beautifully captures the heart of a family, their dire devotion to each other, to their children, to their parents and the inherent need for constant care and nurturing.  Blessed with well executed delivery and fantastic acting on the parts of everyone involved `In America' quickly becomes one of the most engrossing and engaging family dramas to date.<br /><br />Jim Sheridan wrote and directed this masterpiece of a film with such conviction it's undeniable.  The story revolves around a poor Irish couple who move to Hells Kitchen illegally in order to give a better life to their children.  Johnny and Sarah are a loving couple who are devoted to their children.  In fact, last night at birthing class with my wife our instructor asked which movie parent we most sympathized with and or hoped to imitate and Paddy Considine's character immediately came to mind.  He is the father we should all strive to be.  He's devoted, protective, compassionate, understanding and loyal.  The film focuses on their struggle to support themselves, Johnny working hard to become an actor, as well as their struggle to fit in.  They live in a drug infested building yet they manage to keep out of harms way due to their kind hearted nature.  The real heart of this magical film is the power of forgiveness and acceptance.  Sarah and Johnny had previously lost a son, Frankie, and throughout this movie they are plagued with guilt and blame, but the uplifting and heart tugging finale will prove miracles can happen.<br /><br />The acting here is the biggest draw, for without powerful and convincing portrayals the film would have fallen far from its anticipated impression.  Paddy Considine gives one of my favorite performances of the year, and probably my favorite male performance of 2003.  He's convincing and relatable, controlled and so sympathetic.  We can feel his pain, his joy, his sadness, his fear, everything he feels he portrays so vividly it's amazing to watch.  Samantha Morton is one of my favorite actresses and here she again delivers a knock down drag out performance.  She can say so much with her big beautiful eyes it's uncanny.  Djimon Honsou is also brilliant as the families neighbor Mateo, the sick recluse who opens his heart to this family.  Their relationship is the crux for so much of what takes place.  But when talking about acting one must mention the Bolger sisters, Sarah and Emma, who are not only adorable but are so convincing in their performances that I'm astounded these girls are so young.<br /><br />The film is told through the eyes of the oldest daughter Christie and I think that helps in adding layers of sentiment and compassion.  We watch her struggle to be `grown up', fighting her feelings of guilt and pain in relation to the loss of her brother in order to be strong for her parents who obviously can't handle their own pain.  The film reaches levels of sentiment I've never witnessed before, but it's not ever so much that it comes off cheesy or propaganda.  It's realistic in every way and engaging from start to finish.  `In America' is one of the best films of the past decade and is sure to bring a tear to your eye and a smile to your face.art tugging finale will prove miracles can happen.

B000OQF6N6|1.0|Recalling classic days of yore, the album opens with Jimmy Chamberlain banging it out on his drum kit.  Like \\"I Am One\\"!  Or \\"Cherub Rock\\"!  Nope, it's \\"Doomsday Clock\\" the opening track from the newly reconstituted Smashing Pumpkins.  It's all here: the wall of sound guitar, the nasally voice cutting through the mix, the pummelling drums...  (Un)notably absent are James and D'Arcy and while yes they were nice people, let's admit it: calling them fifth wheels would be giving too much credit.      Let me say first: I own all studio releases of the Smashing Pumpkins catalog, including a bunch of singles, live bootlegs, and even a t-shirt or two.  That being said, this album blows.  Over the past few years, it has always taken a stoic dignity to be a Smashing Pumpkins fan (Blinking With Fists, anyone?) and Zeitgeist won't make it any less difficult for die-hard fans.  At best, I was hoping for something that recalled the final offering from Billy Corgan: \\"Untitled\\" which was a breezily rockin' song with minimal 'staring at my belly button' qualities.  Zeitgeist unfortunately heads directly the other way.    Billy Corgan spends most of Zeitgeist convincing people he can rock and, boy howdy, can he ever.  \\"Doomsday Clock\\", \\"7 Shades of Black, and \\"Tarantula\\" all go directly for the jugular and will no doubt leave hard rock enthusiasts writhing in a bloody mess.  Whether or not these songs are relevant in this day and age is another question however.  In his endless quest for the rawk grail, Billy Corgan has sacrificed more than a few intelligence hit points.  The effort to nail the lowest common denominator will be naked to the discerning fan (the who?) and these three songs easily pass off as a dumbed-down Smashing Pumpkins.  The guitar riffs are facile and the songwriting is a step back in melodic construction.    When he's not encouraging overzealous headbanging, Billy Corgan seems intent on testing your gag reflex.  (Ewwww, don't go there!)  Here's the bad news folks: Billy Corgan still writes lyrics like a moody fifteen year old kid.  Morning rain, sunshine, and angels are mentioned without irony, as are souls, blood, and, uh, \\"dulcet tongues\\".  BC clearly raided his little poetry book for material and the results are painful.  Poetry never equals good lyrics (just ask Jewel) because a good vocal melody has to follow its own cadence.      Seriously though.  You gotta have real balls if you are forty years old and writing lines like \\"I love life every day, in each and every way\\" or \\"They cannot wait, their love spells hate\\".  Over the past seven years, Billy Corgan has morphed into a creepy Peter Pan figure from a parallel Neverland.  He's far too overly romantic for an adult of his age and so starry-eyed about youthful purity that it's getting a little disturbing.      Ah well.  If you're a depressed teenager, you'll probably enjoy this CD.  Just keep in mind that when Billy Corgan sings \\"You should call on me baby, 'Cause I'm always there for you\\", he's really not kidding.  Even once you outgrow him, ol' Billy will be right where you left him.    BONUS!  Here's a little game for you kids.  Match the singer with his personal Sword of Damocles!    1.

B00005JGAB|5.0|This is the first thing that pops in my head. Every ounce of praise this album receives is deserved. It's minimalistic, raw, fast, and perfect. Melodies and progressions that are painfully simple and hard to forget. Lyrics that fit perfectly delivered. With DeeDee pounding his bass in your left ear, and Johnny buzzing in the right, this is the punk sound and format that will be emulated forever.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Counting this album, I own the last three White stripes albums, and this one is my second favorite, after Elephant.    What I like about this band is that they aren't afraid to experiment.  What other popular band do you know would use a trumpeter from a mariachi band for a Patti Page cover song?  Or use bagpipes on not one, but TWO songs?!  None -- except the White Stripes!    My favorite song, and the one I can't get enough of is the title track.  The only bad song on the album is \\"Saint Andrew (This Battle is in the Air)\\".  The instuments are so loud, they drown out Meg's voice and you can't hear what she's saying, so I took off half a star for that song.    Jack White is a good songwriter, and this album is no exception.  My favorite lyric on the whole album: \\"You can't take the effect/and make it the cause\\"!    Overall, this is the loudest, thump-iest White Stripes album ever.  Old and new Stripes fans will like this album, so buy it!
B000J4QWMC|2.0|I am not afraid of movie violence, drugs, or anything like that. I am a huge fan of Michael Mann's work. I thought Collateral was fantastic and Heat is easily in my top 5 of all time.     I was excited to see Miami Vice, but after viewing I was left feeling overall disappointment. It lacked the development and human element that made his previous efforts great--I just didn't care what happened to anyone in the whole movie.    Michael Mann is known for creating stark backdrops, but his vision of Miami is just plain cold, without feeling \\"gritty\\" as it was no doubt intended to.     Overall the whole effort felt detatched and sterile, even the performance of the normally vibrant Jamie Foxx. Here's hoping Mann's next effort has a little more life in it.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|In a world of fabricated reality based TV artist and cookie monster metal bands Megadeth answers the call!  United Abominations is thought provoking like only Dave Mustaine can invoke with intelligent lyrics of the current state of the U.N. and the world as a whole and with shredding metal riffs,guitar solos's and musicianship,I haven't heard for lord knows how long!  Dave has resurrected Megadeth with a new line up that is sounding tighter than ever before.   When Dave made his last move with the lineup and signed James Lomenzo to play bass was icing on the cake this band shreds!  I look for big things down the road for this latest version of Megadeth it is refreshing to see them back in the game and at the top of their game!  For all us droogies life couldn't get any sweeter.
0446613444|3.0|Another one of Connolly's books where all the answers are given in the last couple of chapters.  I want to have insight into the characters and plot as I move along.  I have read most all of the Harry Bosch series and there are a few that feel like, \\"whew, I need to end this book somehow.\\"    In this book he has killed the husband of the cop's wife, has a continuing relationship with her, living the lie.  Nice going Harry.    Connolly is a good writer, he sometimes doesn't know how to get off the stage.  The Last Coyote and Angel's Flight are well done and worth reading.
1594489505|5.0|This book takes you to such a different place in the world. It also gives you a historical perspective of the life of an Afghan family. Very character driven which at first irked me a bit, but then I found myself attached emotionally to the struggle of the two main characters. I finished the book in four days which is a rare occasion for me. I strongly reccomend this book and fantastic follow-up for this young author.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|This record gives new meaning to the phrases \\"Quit while you're ahead\\" and \\"In Name Only\\".  If you think that Billy was putting tinfoil over his windows after his solo album sucked at the record store, then he should be well underway with bomb shelter construction now that this new \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" album is out.  I don't feel compelled to write a huge review, so I'll close with this analogy:  Billy Corgan is doing to the name of Smashing Pumpkins what George Bush is doing to the American flag, which is sadly summed up as an utter disgrace.
0385340559|3.0|I've read all of Lee Child's novels, and I think BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE, the eleventh in the \\"Jack Reacher\\" series, is a so-so effort.<br /><br />This novel is moderately entertaining, but I felt it ultimately fell short.  Instead of acting on his own, Reacher teams up with a bunch of other people from his old army unit.  Child does a good job of showing how the team gets together, but doesn't spend much time giving the other team members any real personality.  I also didn't feel much suspense in this book -- the team isn't in any serious danger until the very end.<br /><br />I also felt the plot was kind of silly.  This is a novel about terrorism, but Child structures the book so that the terrorist really isn't the main villain. Child spends more time bashing the LAPD than terrorists in this novel, which I found somewhat annoying.  It's a politically correct way of doing it, which I felt was kind of a cop out.<br /><br />Also, what happened to Reacher in this novel?  He seems rather insecure about himself, and complains about his advanced age more than once.  I thought the whole point of Reacher was that he didn't think such neurotic thoughts.<br /><br />This book isn't terrible, but I would recommend other entires in the Jack Reacher series, such as KILLING FLOOR, TRIPWIRE, ECHO BURNING, ONE SHOT, and THE HARD WAY.
B000P0I4O4|5.0|A well done, low-key medium octane thriller, The Contract works on quite a few levels offering up plentiful helpings of drama, thrills, action, and intrigue.  The story revolves around a father and son learning to reconnect and trust one another under tense circumstances after becoming inadvertantly entangled in a dangerous criminal plot.  Though there are certainly some scenes of violence, the film isn't buried in heavy amounts of gore or extreme violence and was the perfect Friday night thriller for us all including our 18 year old nephew.  Fun, exciting movie; Morgan & Cusack are always in top form.
0553588486|5.0|I read hundreds of books a year, mostly thrillers, but I do pick up a fantasy book now and then.  I'm really glad I picked up this one.  A GAME OF THRONES is really one of the best novels I've read over the past several years.<br /><br />A GAME OF THRONES is a great fantasy novel, but it's also a great novel period.  This is a true epic, with over fifteen major characters and many more supporting characters.  Despite the large cast, each character comes to life in a vivid way.  I found myself caring deeply for many of them, and eagerly turning the pages to see what would happen next.  This is more of a page turner than many thrillers I have read.<br /><br />George RR Martin has created a fantasy world rich in detail, one that I found believable and yet quite magical.  In many ways, this reads more like a historical novel than a fantasy book (Martin apparently based the plot on the War of the Roses to some degree).  This is not a cliche-ridden story about some young farm boy going on a quest for a magical item.  Instead, it's a highly believable story about politics, sex, and family relationships.  It's really quite unique for what it is.<br /><br />A GAME OF THRONES is fairly graphic, and there is indeed a lot of sex in it, although none of it is particularly erotic or gratuitous.  Quite the opposite -- most of the sex is brutal and desultory, which is probably how it really was in the Dark Ages of Europe.  Still, if these types of scenes bother you, then you should definitely skip this book.  This is not a novel meant for young children.<br /><br />A GAME OF THRONES is the first in a proposed seven-part series, and I can't wait to read the second volume.  This novel does require a commitment of time, but it's well worth it.  Highly recommended, and many thanks to the other Amazon members for their informative reviews that convinced me to try this book.
0790729628|4.0|I miss Harrison Ford's voiceover. To delete it just leave the movie somewhat guttet. The few extra seconds of violence just seems like cheep ultra-violence. Something experimental from a bygone age. - I love Blade Runner; But I miss the 1982-version. I agree with those how thinks that the Director's Cut didn't add anything, it only removed something from the movie. And I don't feel I can pay 160 British Pounds for the 1982-versions...
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Best part of this album is it is back to the old sound that put them on the map, like Gish and Siamese Dream.  Mellon Collie was a great album, but my opinion is that they got a more refined, produced, and lost a little edginess.  bottom line, if you like Mellon Collie and earlier, you'll love this album.  if you like the stuff after Mellon Collie, may not fit you.    My only downside to this is that the first half of the album is great.  don't know what happened, but the second half doesn't seem as good to me.  the songs are alright, but didn't catch me as much as the first half, which makes me think they just loaded up their stronger songs to the front.  nothing wrong with that, but it did make me feel a little.........ho hum........towards the end, which is why i went for 4 stars.    in the end, solid album, really good stuff for a long summer road trip to pump on the stereo with the windows down and the wind blowing in your face
B000OLGCHA|2.0|I was sad because I really like Patrick Doyle's music, who composed Goblet of Fire.  And of course John Williams is great as well.  There is very little John Williams source material here, Another Story has a taste of previous themes, then quickly abandoned. A Journey To Hogwarts also offers previous themes.   The opening track on the new album has this electric guitar solo, that just sounds wrong, not in keeping with the Harry Potter world at all. This is a very different score and it's not my favorite. Nicholas Hooper has scored many movies and television shows, but ones you likely haven't heard of. Most of this sounds as if it cold have been from any one of those shows. I understand that John Williams didn't want to spend the rest of his career scoring Harry movies. This may be the weakest score yet.  IMDB lists him for Half-Blood Prince as well, that's sad. Hopefully Williams will return for the final episode.
B000000W5N|5.0|This is a classic album and is certainly in the top 100 ever made! My personal favorite cut is \\"Sway\\"..... I just love to hear Mick Taylor wailing away on his guitar until the fade out. Every cut is exceptional and there are a few hits on this album \\"Brown Sugar\\",\\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Bitch\\", but this album goes much deeper than those obvious cuts with the classic country \\"Dead Flowers\\" and the hard hitting \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" which rocks all the way to the jazz-like end! No filler here it's all great stuff! If your a rock and roll fan this is a must have in your collection.
0553210246|4.0|Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge is a story about Michael Henchard attempts at redemption and the many sorrows, pain, and misery that comes with his decision to uphold his pride and name. To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.<br /><br />The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.<br /><br />Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a façade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.<br /><br />Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes.ometimes tries to create a façade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem.

B000000W5L|5.0|This is such an incredible two album set. From the opening guitar lick of \\"Rocks Off\\" to the final strum in \\"Soul Survivor\\" we know we have just listened to a amazing collection of music! Certainly not a hits album by any stretch! It is a record that sounds great from start to finish or picking random cuts.<br /><br />Being a musician and also having been a DJ in past years in nightclubs and pubs. I always got a great response from hip customers when I would throw in \\"Casino Boogie\\", \\"Sweet Virginia\\", \\"Rocks Off\\", \\"Rip This Joint\\" or \\"All Down The Line\\" in at the local pub. What some folks don't understand is how hard it is to capture this kind of magic and weave so many different sounding songs together to make such an amazing album!<br /><br />Most groups today have one or two types of songs and they just keep regurgitating them over and over again to fill album after album. This IMHO is the last of the great Stones albums, they put out many really good ones after, but never reached greatest again. This is my favorite Stones album and it doesn't even contain my favorite Stones song! A timeless classic that sholuld be in every music lovers collection.
B000M341QE|3.0|While the action is non-stop throughout this movie, I did find it uneven.  Nicholson's portrayal of Costello is endemic of this-he goes from being a cold-blooded mob boss to an uneven egomaniac.  Is Scorcese trying to say that all mob bosses will eventually meet Costello's end? Also, it seems like Alec Baldwin's character disappeared over the second half of the movie.    Having said that, I felt that both DiCaprio and Damon were solid in their performances.  Scorcese did a great job of juxtapositioning their characters, and that really is the heart of the movie.  Although I have a mixed review, overall I enjoy it and I was happy to see Scorcese earn an overdue Best Director Oscar.
B000PY52EU|2.0|This movie was basically made to showcase Christina's body and SLJ's attempt  to play the blues.The storyline fell to the wayside and JT's presence and  lack of acting just added to the quagmire.  I think CR and SLJ are great actors,I just hate they sullied themselves  with this movie.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|I pretty much agree with Matt T. Edmondson.  But with two exceptions.  1) I saw Zwan at their first ever live performance and have heard bootlegs of many of their other shows as well, and they sound distinctly different from either the original Smashing Pumpkins or the new Smashing Pumpkins.  Sadly, Zwan's live material was far better than their horrible official studio album.  Yet I too detect a slight \\"Zwan-ness\\" to the new Pumpkins.  2) My rating order for Smashing Pumpkins albums differs in that I rate Mellon Collie and the Infinate Sadness as their finest album, slightly above Siamese Dream. In either case, a hard act to follow.  My personal order is    Mellon Collie and the Infinate Sadness  Siamese Dream  Pisces Iscariot (outtakes)(also promo copies of the vinyl LP came                             with a 7\\" Single with extra songs)  Adore  Gish  Zeitgeist  Earphoria (Soundtrack of Vieuphoria VHS & DVD)  The Smashing Pumpkins 1991-1998 (Promo Best of CD)  Greatest Hits (2 Disk Version with B-Sides and Rarities)  Machina I: The Machines of God  Machina II (not commercially released)  Greatest Hits (1 Disk Version)    If I rated them numerically, say 1 to 10, the ones in the middle of the list would be rated very close to one another.  Also depending on my mood I may feel differently about any given album.    Several Smashing Pumpkins CD/EPs and CD/Singles are essential as well, including Boxed Sets of singles and EPs.  A few EP titles are Zero, Lull, Peel Sessions, The Aeroplane Flies Higher.  Anyone new to the SP should research their back catalog well, as many great songs were not released on any actual full albums. A couple very rare songs are only found on a few special edition or import versions of vinyl releases (LPs and 45s; 12\\", 10\\", 7\\" phonograph records).    Anyway, just like Adore not being a true SP album since it was recorded by the SP as a trio plus hired drummers, Zeitgeist stands on its own as a good album.  If it were not by the Smashing Pumpkins it would be a great CD!  Wow, this turned into a SP discography almost.  Oh, well.  Maybe the next SP release will be even better.  (I am sure Warner/Reprise is expecting at least three albums.)    (Added 4/15/08) After listening to this album several times and getting all the extra songs put out on the various versions of this album and related singles and EPs I would now rate this album a bit higher, at say 3 1/2 or 3 3/4 stars, just under 4.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|As someone who grew up listening to SP, I must admit I was somehow cautious when I heard of the new album coming out. Somehow after I listened to Zeitgeist for the first time, I was impressed! The Pumpkins are back... regardless of the line up, they are back! Happy to say that this album reminded me of songs from the now classic era of MCIS like Where the boys fear to tread, one of my personal favourites. Yet the only thing I miss is the sound of piano based songs from the Adore era, but nevertheless, Zeitgeist is a great album.
B000006TRV|5.0|That first review pretty much sums up the whole \\"The Wall\\" album. there's not much I can add except just this is a slow paced but enjoyable musical experince. This is well worth getting and is actually my first Pink Floyd CD, and is a good introduction to them. I highly recommend it to people who like classic rock as the music is very soft played, so no head thrashing.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|When I bought my PS3 and HDTV, I wanted to have at least one blu-ray movie to show off the potential of my big kid toys.  Planet Earth was my choice and definitely not a disappointment.     It's great to see something in High definition, but even better if it's worth seeing.  This series is very beautifully filmed.  I can not recommend it enough.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The main feature of the classics in cinema is the fact they have their own life,  transcending by far the well known boundaries of historical time to inscribe in what I might denominate a mythical sphere. Not only due its undeniable virtues as treasured movies, or for the fact Coppola `s clinical eye in what the cast concerned, or the sublime adaptation of a classic best seller, but the meaning significance of its special contour for generations to come or for us who were exceptional witnesses at the moment this movie was presented for first time in the screen. Godfather I is just behind of Citizen Kane and Casablanca in the ambitious list of the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />So, far beyond of all these well deserved epithets, this is without doubt the most important and pyramidal saga of any other film ever made. For many young people, these adjectives may sound old fashioned, but the immortal feature is one of its most important landmarks. This luxurious pack preserves for the memories of the future, the essential nucleus of how was filmed, and for new directors an authentic and perpetual lesson about what are the rules must prevail at the movement to make a successful movie.<br /><br />Is there any other reason for not acquiring ?
B000003Z12|5.0|This music from Neal could really be appreciated by everyone. You don't have to be a guitarist to appreciate how well Neal plays a melody, or to istantaneously love his fluid guitar sounds and his storyteller approach to this album. It is a sort of \\"new age\\" album in a sense, very different from Journey's music for the most part (you can easily understand this from his picture on the album cover which shows him with a Gibson hollow body guitar and not with a Les Paul or with another solid body rock guitar). It is him playing his heart out through the guitar on some calm, exotique and nice compositions that reminds me here and there some things written by Russ Freeman (Espanique, CoolBreeze or Zanzibar for instance). Here Neal is helped by his Journey colleague Jonathan Cain exceptional composer, arranger and keyboard player. What can I add? It is beautiful instrumental music very well played, music that you can enjoy in a lot of situations and that really deserves attention. I own a lot of solo albums from Neal and this is the one that I'd suggest to everyone who wants an album of very beautiful instrumental \\"guitar\\" music or that want to own something good from Neal. But don't think to shred guitar. Neal here plays very softly for the most part, making some doublings here and there like he usually does when he plays with Journey too, but this album is about melody and emotion not about show off. He very rarely use full distorted sounds here, instead he tends to gravitate towards clean or soft crunchy sounds .... but here and there his rock soul appears through his long sustained lead sound, and well ... he shines as he usually does! A very nice album I'm listening a lot in these days.
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman, for the uninitiated, is a breath of fresh air. You cannot predict his plotlines, and only Neil himself could dream up these unique and bizarre characters. I am not a big fan of horror or fantasy, but I love Neil Gaiman because he pulls it off by making it realistic, as if he is telling a true story.<br /><br />This is the first Gaiman book I read. It left me hungry for more, and I have read several of his other works, including the graphic novels. Gaiman doesn't know how to do cheesy, boring, or predictable. He is simply original, exciting, thought-provoking, and funny!
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is probably the most heroic political figure today.  In Infidel, she narrates her remarkable life with a truly shocking level of honesty.  The book is written in a matter-of-fact style that exudes her remarkable level of character.    This is not just an engrossing book, or an entertaining book, or an educational book.  Though it's all of those things, this is first and formost an important book.  Like no work before it, Infidel gives a window into a culture slowly trending towards radical Islam.  It's at once both deeply humanizing of these people, and utterly unsparing in its descriptions of the evil that they can do.    It's ironic that a woman who writes for the emancipation of women from Islamic oppression, now lives in a cage of security due to threats of Islamic violence.  This book deserves to be bought, if only as a show of support for a woman living under the terrible threat of an Islamic fatwa.  Her filmmaking partner has already been killed for speaking against that faith, and this book is triumphantly unafraid in pronouncing that religious bullying can not murder the voice of people who are truly committed to bettering the world.    Buy this book.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins is one of those exciting authors who can put their energy on page in a way that you feel it. When you put a Collins book down, you are ready to take on the world. It is even better than listening to music to get psyched up, because his energy is coupled with wisdom and strategies.    Collins is an artist. He draws up systems with which to conceptualize business principles. The systems are simple, profound, and sexy. I think of him along the lines of Stephen Covey and Thomas Friedman--the subjects are different, but the ability to systemize complex ideas and make them visual and workable are similiar.    I keep this book within easy reach, and I often flip through it just for fun.
B000QCUB8I|4.0|I'll say it. The electronic/dance record of 2007 has arrived. The long-awaited, super amazing full length from French duo, Justice, breathes life once again into your neighborhood dance floor and come June 11, 2007, also in your favorite record shop. Justice is made up of Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Auge, two men that have become famous for mixing a bit of religion with their incredible and righteous beats. It seems wherever they turn up, they make any club/festival into their own private house of worship, and the faithful have been eating it up. Barely visible during their live sets, the two stand behind their giant glowing cross that adorns the decks. Its an ironic twist on the idea of a religious experience. After hearing this album in full, you might be a follower of what they've laid down as well.    Mixing some Daft Punk with early Chemical Brothers gets you about halfway there. Cross's strength is a flawless mix of dance and electronic styles, delivered with amazing production and energy to spare. It follows on the heels of a few well received singles, like 2006's Waters of Nazareth (which is smartly included here). Also catching buzz has been their fun graphically inspired video for the lead single, D.A.N.C.E. The song is great, with or without said video, it's a weird hybrid of Daft and Michael Jackson, with some children's vocals thrown in. It will be one of your favorites this summer, if isn't already.    The really amazing thing about this record is that it holds up through the entire tracklisting. I might have to go back to Underworld's Beaucoup Fish for the last time that happened (ok, maybe Milo's Destroy Rock n Roll, or MSTRKRFT's The Looks). It opens super strong with (appropriately titled) Genesis. As the perfect opener, it's a pulsing surge of fuzzy beats mixed with some over the top drama and a setup found usually in hollywood blockbuster movies, not dance records.  never loses steam after Genesis fades into Let There Be Light, in fact it mighteven get stronger as the record chugs along. I found stuff like Phantom, The Party and New Jack, being as enjoyable as the singles. Stress, a song which backs the final third of the record, is unbelievably grand and just as in-your-face awesome. Vocals and vocal samples on Cross are kept to a minimum, appearing on just a few tracks, The Party (featuring foul-mouthed bass gal, Uffie), D.A.N.C.E., and DNVO. Its a perfect amount of vocals, in fact, everything on this record is pretty much spot on, even the T-Rex-esque album art is terrific.    If you like house/electro/club/Miami bass/trance/breakbeat/dance...whatever, it really doesn't matter. Justice  aims to please, and happens to do much more than that. A must have.
0140157352|4.0|I originally read this for a class in Negotiation Skills, but I have since found it useful in many aspects of life. It is a quick read, but it is a book that you earmark, highlight, annotate, and return to many times. The case studies are perfectly chosen, the layout is logical, and the writing is simple but not dull.<br /><br />Getting to Yes introduces the art of negotiation to those who have never had to think about it. It contains a philosophy that is wise and practical. It reveals the tactics that your opponent may use and how to disarm them. It also provides several strategies for preparing for, engaging in, and closing negotiations.<br /><br />The ideas in this book can be used to buy a car, or to sell a car. They could be used by a State Department official negotiating a peace agreement, or a married couple negotiating who does which chores. I would find it useful in a job interview or a contract negotiation. This is a book to re-read, to reference, and to recommend to others.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I am re-watching the first 4 movies, in anticipation of seeing the 5th movie this weekend.  I pulled \\" The Sorcerer's Stone\\" from my collection, and this dvd is the 2 disc widescreen edition.  With over 1800 reviews already, I will not rehash the plot.  Besides watching the movie, I watched most of the extra's on the dvd.  On the first disc is the movie, plus a cast/crew section.  I thought I would get a more thorough bio on the main stars, but it was a basic \\"Professor Snape: Alan Rickman\\".  I would have liked so see a bio with the movies the main actors had been in previously.  Rickman and Coltrane were so good as Snape and Hagrid, that I wanted to catch them in some other movies. Oh well.  There was also a teaser trailer and a theatre trailer.  The second disc had most of the extra's.  I enjoyed the tour of the Hogwart's Mansion, but wish they would have showed more.  I also enjoyed the conversation with the production staff about bringing the movie to life from the book.  The 2nd disc is very interactive, and each section has many subsections.  Very cool!  The movie was awesome both visually, character-wise, and plot wise.  There is alot of book to put in one movie.  My overall grade for the DVD would be a 5 for the movie and a 4 for the Dvd extras!
B000QUCNOU|5.0|I'm reading a lot of the same criticisms of this film so I will deal with each of the most common ones in turn:    \\"The movie is too long\\"  Not true. The movie is as long as it needs to be. There is a lot of information about this case - most of it has to be discarded. What is left has earned its place and needs to be there. I found the film gripping to the end.    \\"The killer doesn't figure highly enough. It is too dull and talky\\"  This criticism usually comes from lovers of serial-killer thrillers. After seeing a few murders in the beginning of the film, they expect it to crack up a notch as it progresses. It is true that The Zodiac is largely absent from the 2nd half of the film, but that only allows the main plot (one character's obsession) to dominate which is where the film really starts to take shape. Obsession and its effects are the point of this film. It is not a Columbo-type good guy v bad guy puzzle-solver. The bad guy doesn't have to figure highly when there is so much conflict between the good guys. Police departments that don't talk to each other, journalists and police arguing with each other, a Zodiac obsessive getting no co-operation from people who want to forget the case. Throw in a couple of creepy suspects and a series of bizarre telephone calls and you have enough drama to keep the story always engaging.    \\"The film's conclusion is wrong\\"  The film's conclusion is right, GIVEN ITS SOURCE MATERIAL. It may not be always factually accurate, nor does it need to be. It's a drama inspired by true events, not a documentary. The important thing is that Zodiac makes clear who provided its source material and the cirsumstances surrounding its production.    \\"Not Fincher's best\\"  I think it's his best work to date. Of course if you come to this film expecting to see Seven 2, you will almost certainly be disappointed. It's more like a cross between All the Presidents Men and JFK. It  lacks the bold and inventive camerawork and lighting of Seven and FightClub and its hard to believe sometimes that it was made by the same director. On the other hand, it takes someone with the skills to make films such as these to have been capable of maturing into the director that made Zodiac. It deals with far more complex, weighty and difficult material than did Fincher's earlier movies and the sober and precise style he uses is entirely appropriate.     \\"The violence in this film is too brutal. One scene in particular is too much\\"  This is a valid criticism. I found the scene in question very shocking and the viewer should be aware of this. However it cannot be dismissed as unnececcessary because it has the desired effect of letting the audience know in no uncertain terms what this individual is capable of. This action resonates in later scenes making them more effective. On the whole this is not a violent film at all.     \\"The acting is rubbish\\"  Ok, I don't think anyone really said this (unless they are crazy). I just wanted to contrive the opportunity to say that the acting in this film is of a very high standard. Jake Gylenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, John Carroll Lynch - all excellent. And Robert Downey junior's much needed humerous touch was worth the price of admission alone!    Worth seeing for anyone who appreciates an intelligent story well-told.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Look... ive been a pumpkins fan since the late 80's, and saying that, I really dont understand why ppl say that they can tell a difference with the absence of james and darcy. I for 1 have a great feeling of nostalgia for the old line up, but darcy and james never contributed anything but asthetics, and a couple of b-side quality singing efforts on MCIS and Gish. Billy and Jimmy have always been the backbone of the music. James has stated many times in interviews after the bands demise that \\"the only way the pumpkins will be gone is if billy makes it so\\" .     Music wise this record is the best since MCIS. The Ava Adore influence that was still there for Machina is gone. Cruchy chords, layerd with screeching guitar is here in droves. Billy's singing is a bit to layerd for my taste. I kind of wished he would leave the layering on the floor, but its a small gripe and doesnt take away from the music. This is not Siamese 2 or MCIS 2, it is on the other hand a great evolution of a great band. Get in your car and grank up the volume, cause its awsome, and pumpkin fans...and rock fans for that matter....will love it! We all wish we we're in high school again, but we have to move on, and so have the pumpkins. Long Live Rock & Roll!!!
B000OHZJ9Q|5.0|...they've made an album that has many elements of what we know and love as Porcupine Tree, but also adds things we've never heard from them before.  I've heard many mixed reviews of this album, but I personally love it. The energy is great, the emotion is high, and every track brings something new and different to the table. The title track is probably my number one driving song of 2007 thus far. It's so full of that PT energy I love, and I still haven't gotten sick of listening to it. \\"My Ashes\\" might be one of my least favorites (although I seem to be alone in this sentiment as I keep hearing it compared to \\"Trains\\"), but it's still pretty cool. \\"Anesthetize\\" is just incredible. I'm a sucker for those long, epic tracks, and this one is no exception. I remember when I saw them live last October and Steven made a joke about not being used to playing songs that long like Dream Theater, but they do a pretty good friggin' job of it. The band played most of the album for us before they recorded it, and a lot of it got lost in my head after months of not hearing it, but I remembered this one right away. It's beautiful and haunting and downright awesome. I love the heavier parts, too, especially when they sort of come out of nowhere. \\"Sentimental\\" is the kind of mellow track I need to be in the mood for, but I enjoy it... and it tends to pop up in my head a lot. \\"Way Out Of Here\\" is just awesome, although I can't really think of a better way to describe it. It kind of hits a personal note with me, so sometimes I get a bit emotional when I hear it. Lastly, \\"Sleep Together\\" is just great (I'm really not cut out to write reviews, I need a thesaurus), especially the strings! It's the perfect finale for this album, which is no surprise since PT always seem to have the best opening and closing tracks. So far, this is definitely my favorite album of 2007. PT, Dream Theater, and Pain of Salvation are my three favorite bands, and so far I have to say I prefer this new one to thenew ones of the other two (Systematic Chaos and Scarsick). Is it PT's best? Nah, but that doesn't say much, because the ones I would (probably) rank above it are just incredible. I find it damn near impossible to rank albums, though, because they're just different and they all have their highs and lows. Anyway, just get this one... and all of the rest, too!

B00009N83Y|4.0|I love movies set in this era. I love the clothes, the cars, the music; it was just a simpler time in America's history.    Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood play off of each other so well and the one-liners are hilarious. Great plot, great comedy, and great fun.    Reynolds when Eastwood walks unannounced into the office: \\"I didn't hear you knock.\\"    Eastwood: \\"What a relief. I thought I was going deaf.\\"    These two constantly banter like this throughout the whole fim and it's always funny.    Give this fun flick a try.
0143038419|5.0|This book was funny and insightful, and I've already recommended it to several thirty-something friends.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This CD, as everyone has previously mentioned, is absolutely awesome. I purchased two of the 'deluxe' editions, one for myself and one for my mother's 91st birthday. The shipping, direct from [...], was a disaster. They will say shipping dates are 'estimated,' however, they went far beyond that. I got an email after two weeks saying they were having some kind of unspecified problem filling the order and then got the product about 10 days after that. Totally unacceptable. I've always had excellent service from Amazon sellers (aftermarket), but I will certainly discourage my friends from giving me Amazon gift certificates in the future, as they have done in the past. Shame, Amazon!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The BBC along with Sir David Attenborough and his distinguished team strike once again.   No words can explain this awesome piece of work.  The thoughts, efforts and devotion invested in this epic are way beyond imagination.   Watching \\"Planet Earth\\" in a home theater will by all means deliver a natural high, due to the sharp wide angle view and music combination.  Blue Planet, Birds, Mammals and \\"Planet Earth\\" are a must have in any library.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|I pretty much loved listening to everything SP / Billy had released until Machina. That album and pretty much everything that Billy's released since has, for the most part, sucked, whether it be with Zwan or solo or whatever - I must say that I loved his cover version of \\"You Don't Know What It's Like\\". How can you release something as epic as Mellon Collie or as personal as Ave Adore and then expect people to buy into this inferior crap? The amps are set to 11 and you're screaming like someone dropped an anvil on your big toe but so what! None of that stuff will help carry a weak song - just ask Marilyn Manson.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|First of all, to have this billed as a 'Smashing Pumpkins' album is extremely misleading.  The only two original members is Billy Corgan and the (ironically enough) once-exiled drummer Jimmie Chamberlin.  Completely missing is James Iha and D'Arcy.  So right off the bat, this was an album that, in my mind, was behind the eight-ball to start with.  You're missing half the band and the one-guy you did get to come back was someone you gave the boot to in the first place.    One or two decent tracks just isn't enough to justify a glorified Billy Corgan solo album.  If you need a good Pumpkins fix, go to their earlier work up to around 'Mellon Collie' ...
1932100660|5.0|I admire Dr. Campbell for writing this book.  I know it is not easy standing up and say it like it is. This book had to have made some people a little angry.  Because of that I want to make sure everyone reads it.  He has had the courage to say what Dr.'s should be telling us and I admire him for that.  I am a Nikken Independant Wellness Consultant and we are constantly trying to get this information out to the public.  I want to thank him for providing us another tool to use to educate people on making the right choices.  If everyone of us tell at least one more person we can educate a whole lot of people.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|I'll state up front that I'm a huge Michael Mann fan and I'm being as generous as I can when I label this as being \\"Fair.\\"  The truth is that it's an uncharacteristically sloppy effort from the vastly talented cast and crew (Mann in particular).    As for the bright spots, Jamie Foxx makes another solid outing.  Foxx is quickly gaining a great deal of my attention.  He's done ('Stealth' aside) a couple of genuinely terrific films in a pretty short period of time.  The film's action sequences are also at the same high-level that I've come to expect from any Mann film.    As for the bad, unfortunately, the writing and the directing are both sub-par and that falls squarely on Mann's shoulders.  Right from the opening twenty minutes of the 'Director's Cut' and it's inflated and pointless boat race through to the end of the club scene where we meet-up with Crockett and Tubbs getting ready to take down a prostitution ring.  Then a cell phone rings and we learn that a different operation is going wrong.  I looked down at my watch to realize that close to a half an hour had gone by and absolutely nothing relevant to the film had even happened yet because the entire movie up to this point has just been dropped for a totally different story-arc.  This whole un-sequence leads into what I thought was the story.      We're told that there's an information leak that caused the death of two under-cover agents.  Farrell and Foxx are then asked to help ferret-out the security-breach since they're unknown to anyone else in the operation.  However, this \\"mole-in-the-department\\" is never explored any further.  Isn't anyone concerned that,pretty clearly, someone inside is selling out their people?  Not to mention that for all their trouble they never actually arrest the character 'Montoya' (the film's primary villian) which leaves the film's ending feeling hurried and half-finished.  Plot-lines seem to just be dropped or conjured-up all over the place for no apparent reason.    Outsideof Foxx, the acting seems to be fair to below average.  As odd as this is going to sound Colin Farrell seems to be trying too hard to seem gritty and noir-ish.  Li Gong, in my opinion, is miscast as Crockett's love-interest.  Not only do I think they cast an actress with the wrong nationality, but her actress's accent is so thick, it makes her difficult to understand.  Mann would have been better served with someone like Penelope Cruz.  Granted, the \\"brooding cop\\" archetype has been done to death, but there's no real character development anywhere in the movie.  The reason it's necessary is because when we see Crockett fall for Gong's character, it comes off not feeling genuine and you don't buy into it.  It undermines one of the only working plots the film has going for it two-thirds in.    I'd recommend this for fans of Mann only.  This is a work that seems to want very badly to be both 'Heat' and 'Collateral' at exactly the same time and (unfortunately) fails in both attempts.
0441009425|3.0|To start with I want to say that the first 175 pages of the book are boring and not very good. In fact there were times when I started to put it away and not finish it. However I bought all 3 books so I chose to solider on and it did get better and more exciting. You have to get into the heart of the book to enjoy the story as in 200+ pages    There are some things about the book I don't like. Such as the world building (or should say galaxy building) isn't up to par it is very shallow and I don't feel amazed by it at all in fact it is vanilla. I don't really have any connection with the cities and people at all. Its only 300 to 500 years in the future depending on what part of the timeline the characters are discussing. The technology seems out of time or not very believable the travel of 1% below light speed is fine but the author just sort of glosses over it by some mysterious engines built by a techno group. That's ok though I can deal with that I suppose and he may open up that technology later or maybe I missed it somewhere...    The constant change of perspective and year is hard to get used to. In fact it can be annoying for a good deal of the book, the small cliffhangers every few pages doesn't raise the excitement factor for me at all in fact I dislike the style of writing. At the same time however I understand keeping all the timeline together is important with the way technology works space travel. In essence you have 2 or 3 sometimes more plots going on in different decades and the perspective changes every 2 to 5 pages.    With all that said though there is a good story here and it is interesting once you get past the mundane beginning. Some of the cyborg, computer AI and medical technology is really very good stuff. Some of the other technology in the book is just vague but it gets more and more interesting as you read.    Hopefully the next 2 books in the series will make up for the boring parts in this book. I just wish there was some character in the book that I could connection with and like. So far there aren't any I care for at all they could get killed and would be ok. Maybe it will change and I didn't mean for this review to be completely negative but that is how it reads. There is a story there you just have to concentrate a great deal to bring it out.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|For the price you're being asked to pay, this is a terrific set with a lot of great music.  However, the criticisms everyone seems to universally have are as glaring as they are legitimate.  First is the spotty audio quality due to the poor condition of the existing recordings and the second is what you're missing out on.    I can live with the audio.  Sure I'd do hand-springs if it was in 5.1 surround and I could really crank up my stereo and jam out with my air-guitar.  As it is though, the audio quality ranks somewhere around the \\"OK\\" to \\"Acceptable\\" range.  Not great by a long-shot, but I guess it'll do.    Unforgivable, however, is the HOURS of missing footage.  The real tragedy here is that some of the missing sets are the concert's most memorable, history-making, moments.  It's borderline-tragic that, in the zeal of making this a one-in-a-lifetime event, the footage and audio weren't preserved better.  From what I understand Geldof was very against any recordings existing and since Mtv was in its infancy, they simply didn't know what to do with what they had.    So again, it's a good value for your dollar and I can't not recommend it, but I can't help but sigh when I think of what a treasure this might have been.
B00005JPD0|3.0|Because this movie requires a modicum of intelligence from its viewers to understand its time traveliness, I was initially intrigued by Deja Vu.<br /><br />But ultimately, the film betrayed me.

B0002W18MU|5.0|This, obviously, is the fifth album in Johnny Cash's American Recordings series.  Johnny Cash recorded several dozen songs after his wife June died and up until his death.  A couple of years later, enough time had past so that producer Rick Rubin finally felt comfortable listening to the tapes.  He chose twelve of the songs to be included on this album.  It's a very powerful but sad album.  Johnny's voice was very ragged by this point, but that just adds to the poignancy.  Some people have conjectured that Cash knew he didn't have long to live, due to the type of songs incuded here.  But I think you have to keep in mind the fact that the songs here are the ones that Rick Rubin chose to include, out of the many that Cash recorded.  There will be an American VI, which reportedly will feature \\"lighter\\" songs from the same same sessions as this album.  If American VI is only half as good as American V, it will be well worth getting.

0446677450|1.0|This book is the all-time winner for the worst book - of any kind - I've ever read. Kiyosaki has provided nearly 200 pages of repetitive, contradictory, meaningless pandering pap. The best thing that can be said about this book is, congratulations to him for marketing an ages-old scam approach based on unprovable fables and dreamy wishful thinking. There are absolutely no specifics and several tactics he does provide are literally illegal.    Want success? Just quit your job, get smarter people than you to work for you, make insulting and ridiculous offers for real estate, break the IRS and SEC laws and spend $3000 on a Kiyosaki seminar.    If you want details before you buy or even touch this book, read the excellent expose at johntreed.com. I wish I had. I literally just threw a $20 bill into the trash - and Mr. Kiyosaki got half of it.

0061150142|3.0|After you've read a few Jodi Picoult books, you come to expect certain things. A compelling, flashpoint topic (teen suicide, stigmata, school shootings, sexual abuse, etc.) that rips a small New England community apart. Courtroom drama. Finely wrought family dynamics. A maverick lawyer, a quirky judge, and a lot of angst. Tons of plot twists and turns.    All of the above were present in \\"The Pact,\\" a story of the death of a teenage golden girl, with her longtime boyfriend accused of the murder -- which he claims was a double suicide gone awry. The defendant bobs and weaves as news of Emily's pregnancy comes to light, and plenty of red herrings are thrown into the mix. But still something was missing.    I felt like there just wasn't quite ENOUGH drama in this book... I expected one more horrifying secret to be revealed at the end. I did not believe that Emily's reasons for killing herself were sufficiently grave. And I couldn't believe that NO ONE -- not the police, not his parents, not the lawyer, no one -- asked Chris what really happened that night.     Stilll, with Picoult's wonderful writing, this book is still worth reading.
0316010669|2.0|I absolutely adore Malcolm Gladwell and pretty faithfully follow his work in the New Yorker and on his website, as well as his other works.  (No, I'm not a stalker, just a fan hee-hee).  However, I didn't love this book quite as much.  I won't summarize it again here; I'll just leave a few quick complaints.    1. It's possible to read the last two paragraphs of each chapter and pretty much get the gist of the whole chapter.  If the paragraphs leading up to these last two were interesting and thought-provoking, I wouldn't do this, but by the end, I just wanted to finish.    2. The pattern of each chapter follows a predictable course: introduce an eccentric real person, introduce a concept related to our brain's ability to make a snap judgment, and then combine these two to show how that eccentric person is or uses an example of neural abilities.  Oh, and then follow-up with a quickie bit of advice on how to apply this to our own lives.    3.  None of the eccentric people or neuroscience is especially new or thought-provoking anyway.      So, save yourselves some money and continue reading Malcolm's work in the New Yorker online.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I'm a linkin park fan like most of you on here. I just wanted to shed some light on whats goin on with this album and linkin park as a whole. Yes this album is much different from hybrid theory and meteora, and some people absolutely hate this album because it is so different. In my opinion, this album is the worst out of the three but its not a bad album. \\"What I've done\\", \\"Bleed It Out\\", and \\"No More Sorrow\\" are the best songs on there while the others like \\"In pieces\\" and \\"In Between\\" are probably apart of linkin parks evolution and the songs aren't really that bad.    Also, I feel that linkin park is evolving just like any other long lasting band to stay in the business. I mean come on, people are bashing on them for changing while when Meteora first came out (and you can see for yourself under the reviews on Meteora) that alot of people hated this album because they aren't musically talented or that they sound exactly the same as hybrid theory. One reviewer thought that since they sound the same, the band is a fad and will soon pass over because of there lack of expanding. Um, isn't that what they've done here, they've expanded from their original sound to prove that they have talent (which is evident in the guitar solo in \\"In Pieces\\"). Also its a huge blow to a band saying that they aren't talented instrumently and this album I feel is an F*** you to those critics. When hybrid theory first came out, it took the teen scene by storm. Now, much of them are in their 20's and I think that is one of the reasons for linkin park changing. I mean what 20+ year old still wants to listen to the teeny rock (don't get me wrong hybrid theory is a great album, I just don't listen to it as much any more)? Also, a band has to change so that their fans don't get bored with the same old sounding music. Look at Green Day, they've completely changed their sound from their best album Dookie to American Idiot (which wasn't too bad) thats a 10 years difference. Would you expect Linkin Park to be around for 10 years if they sounded the same every album, or can anybody tell me a band that has lasted over 10 years that hasn't changed? Me either thats what I thought. Same with Metallica (whom by the way is way past their prime) from their first 3 albums which were amazing to their last 3 albums.    In any case, Linkin Park isn't going to please everybody, but one thing is for sure, the band is evolving for the better.
0671042858|5.0|Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.<br /><br />Your \\"helpful\\" vote is greatly appreciated. Thanks<br /><br />A very short review is not necessarily a bad review. You don't want to re-tell the whole story. I try for the hook that will make a person want to read this book. In my opinion, you should read long reviews after you read the novel. Read a short review first.<br /><br />This story is not the blood-and-guts scary we're used to with Steven King, but it is scary. A nine-year-old girl becomes lost in the woods of Maine for days and days. What an adventure! And what's following her! I don't want to give anything away, but this story is only lightly supernatural.<br /><br />It's one of King's best stories in my opinion. The book-on-tape version is also fantastic.<br /><br />Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated.
1594489505|5.0|The bar was set incredubly high with Kite Runner, and I feared Hosseini couldn't replicate the brilliance of his first novel, but this one delivers. It's true the impact is slightly muted because readers have been prepared by his first book for what's coming in his second. While this is not a sequel, it carries the same flavor of the first. Those previously unfamiliar with the struggles of Afghan women will find a second dose here. And it leaves no less an impact than in his first.<br /><br />The story is equally impressive the writing even better. It is meaty and gut wrenching, but light when it needs to be. I just finished and I already can't wait for his third.
0060555661|3.0|As the title of this review indicates, do yourself a favour and buy the original Ben Graham version not this one with Zweig.    Let me start by saying that Warren Buffett had nothing to do with this book, the preface and appendix are extracts from the Financial Analysts Journal and transcripts of a 1984 talk at Columbia University.    The orignal Ben Graham material is mostly intact in each chapter.  It is not full of calculations, so it is not difficult to read, but it is a slow and deliberate building of an argument on investing.  As such people who are interested in the book for its investment advice will find it logical and sensible.  Zwieg however has decided that his own footnotes are far more valuable than Graham's so he has moved Graham's footnotes to the appendix and put his notes under the original text - which is why I say that the chapters are \\"mostly intact\\", but not completely.    After each of Graham's chapters, Zweig has included a commentary chapter of his own.  These chapters and his footnotes will give you the feeling that \\"a high school science student was commenting on the PhD work of a professor\\".  The commentary is a weak summary, mostly devoid of any insight and sometimes making statements about what Graham \\"would have said\\", which is nothing short of egregious.    Overall, I give Graham's original chapters five stars and Zweig's additions one star, resulting in an average of 3 stars.    This book is a clear example of someone jumping on the bandwagon and trying to associate himself with prominent people like Graham and Buffett.  So do yourself a favour and buy the original Graham version, that way you won't feel like Zweig suckered you into buying his book, using Graham's name.    Link to the orignal version: [[ASIN:0060752610 The Intelligent Investor: The Classic Text on Value Investing]]

0671027344|4.0|Written in the form of letters to a person whose identity is never revealed, 'Wallflower' is a fun, engaging and poignant read detailing Charlie's freshman year of high school. As Charlie shares his new social experiences with the reader there are many moments that resonate, and probably any reader, regardless of what one's social status is or may have been in high school can identify with Charlie on some level. One of his more endearing characteristics is his introspectiveness, and this work reminded me of both 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' and 'The Catcher in the Rye.'
B000FWHVKA|5.0|I am always skeptical but never fail to be blown away by the superb recommendations of the mighty indie music juggernaut Pitchforkmedia.  It was only a short time ago that I half heartedly accepted listening to The Knife over a half year after Pitchfork announced it as their number one album of 2006.  Initial listens confirmed my apathy, splaying taboo euro-techno drums and synths with awkward, processed vocals.  I don't know quite what compelled me to make repeated listens really, but those subsequent listens have absolutely floored me.  I have literally had the album on repeat amongst scores of incredible, enticing new music that I could be listening to.  It is the first album to do that to me since Joanna Newsom's Ys.   I feel like I can't keep listening to Silent Shout or else my 2006 gem (and my #1 of '06), Joanna Newsom's Ys, may be in danger of a retrospective rank toppling.  That type of talk may just be from shock but it still isn't verifiably impossible.  The Knife's Silent Shout is an absolutely unequivocal modern masterpiece.  The difficulty is becoming familiar with and used to instrumentation that seemed to played out even in its hayday of the 80's.  As previously experienced, you will likely play the first tracks and be wondering to yourself how anyone got suckered into buying into this Swedish hype.  Patience though is the key here.  The album must be consumed as a whole - only then will the kitschiness dissipate and the pure satisfaction of the album bleeds through.  Slowly, one by one, every element from the seemingly inadequate drum machine to the apparently juvenile vocals will find their place and suddenly there is no turning back- you have already listened to the album 5 times in a row.
0446677450|1.0|The \\"one star\\" is for the simple, somewhat decent, top-line advice this book gives: it's better to be rich than not; it's better to not work hard for money; be positive; you can do it; etc. Aside from that, this is the most repetitive, repetitive, and repetitive book I've read in a long time. Was Kiyosaki merely trying to fill pages? Was he being paid by the word? ...Heck, if this is his idea of making millions without working, he's nailed it. Bravo!    That said, my biggest complaint about this \\"book\\" is how little information there is in it. He says you should incorproate. But never even begins to give even a clue as to how. He says you should \\"pay yourself first\\", even before creditors and the Government, but again, the nuts and bolts of that seemingly empowering advice are consipicuously absent. And the big one is *how* he made all his money without really working, and subsequently had his money \\"work for him\\"... you guessed it: real estate. And certainly, when this book was originally published, buying real estate was a great idea, albeit in retrospect. And that's probably a large part of the reason this book is so popular. But beyond real estate (which is NOT a good idea at the moment), he offers nothing beyond stocks and bonds. Nada.    If I hadn't blew through this rag in 2 days, I would've been more irked at the precious time I wasted reading it.    Hugely overrated. Empty. And poorly written.
0316010669|4.0|I gave it four stars because I did like the book - but it can be a little tedious to read. As previous reviews have stated, each chapter does have a theme - but the theme is usually a mere framework for a set of results from an experiment, incident or story, some of which are a little boring.    When you review everything you have read at the end of the book, you realize that the point each chapter makes does feed into a bigger overall understanding of how split second decisions are made and how much our subconscious is in control when we just get a \\"feeling\\" about something immediately. Then it examines how other elements can affect the accuracy of the split second decision.    Overall, I think this was a good read.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|Introducing: Nicholas Hooper.  That a new composer enters an established film franchise is not exactly a novelty, but that someone with a background that includes indeed nothing but television shows and documentaries is suddenly scoring a Harry Potter film, that is special, not to say unique, even if he and director David Yates have a long record of collaborations.  And indeed, the studio had to be convinced that Hooper was up to the task by delivering a series of demo tracks.   This album runs around 55 minutes, being considerably shorter that all four previous Potter soundtracks. The tracks are out of film order, which is a move I don't understand at all. Some say this ensures a better listening experience, but I strongly disgaree. Thematic development and musical coherence should already be present in the film itself, there should be no need to rearrange things.    The album opens with quite a brave move, the inclusion of a distorted electric guitar for the firework unleashed by the Weasley twins. Personally, I find it very jarring and disturbing, even if it depicts the twins' tendency to break rules. The rest of the track bears a strong and strange resemblance to Howard Shore's firework music in Fellowship Of The Ring.  We then get a concert arrangement of Professor Umbridge's theme, which is reprised later on in \\"The Room Of Requirement\\" and \\"Umbridge Spoils A Beautiful Morning\\". When exactly did the unwritten rule emerge that every Potter film needs a goofy comedy march? It was required for Lockheart. It was a fun and isolated idea to score Aunt Marge with a waltz. It was fitting for Rita Skeeter. But Professor Umbridge is a character that requires anything but such a fluffy and tingling theme. Yes, her funny appearance should be touched by the music, but at her core, this woman is a devil. Does Hooper pick this characteristic up? No, not even in one bar.  Hooper's treatment of Hedwig's Theme, however, is the best since Prisoner Of Azkaban, even if it just appears two or three times on album. He juices it up a little with different orchestrations and counterpoints that just sound fresh, compared to Patrick Doyle's bland interpretation.  It bothers me, though, that the Harry Potter legacy John Williams left behind always gets reduced to this.    So far, so good, but slowly we should get to the main theme of the film, shouldn't we? Well, if my ears don't cheat me, there doesn't seem to be any concert arrangement or anything of the main theme. I'm not even sure whether Order Of The Phoenix has a prominent main theme. There are some moments of sweeping glory that are definitely thematic, but these are short, and leave you unsatisfied. This is a major drawback of this score, you are simply not able to identify it with any particular music, except Umbridge's piece of fluffy nothingness.  This score is highly non-thematic, and that is not only highly surprising, it is, let's be honest, highly unsatisfying. No matter at which important part of the score, where you would expect some moving pieces, you look, you will always find nothing substantial. May it be \\"Death Of Sirius\\", \\"The Sacking Of Trelawney\\", \\"Darkness Takes Over\\" or \\"The Kiss\\", you will fail at finding thematic material.  The whole album flies by without leaving an impression, you're like a spectator, waiting for something interesting to happen.    Just like Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Hooper doesn't quote previous scores, which, yet again, doesn't help the continuity. And in the one place he does quote, \\"Darkness Takes Over\\", he quotes Doyle's pale Voldemort motif.   Speaking about Voldemort, Hooper wrote a piece for the Dark Lord's slow taking over of Harry's mind, appropriately called \\"Posession\\". This features maybe the score's best moments, with the kind of Viola writing that I would love to hear more of in today's scores. And, intentionally or not, he quotes a strain from the brilliant \\"A Window To The Past\\" in this track.    Another thing that is worth to be pointed out is the strangely small- sounding tone of the whole score.  This could have something to do with the orchestration of this score. It is miles better than anything Patrick Doyle wrote for Goblet Of Fire, but it has different flaws. It is not a flaw exclusive to Order Of The Phoenix, it's a general flaw of many modern scores. Too many senseless and directionless string runs, and a ridiculous reliance on french horns for anything that resembles a thematic phrase. Just listen to \\"Flight Of The Order Of The Phoenix\\". You couldn't possibly come up with something more bland.  And there are even a few technical \\"mistakes\\", if you can call them that. For instance, in \\"Dumbledore's Army\\", the clarinets play in the instrument's most uninteresting register, resulting in a distinct atmosphere of dullness.     The score, generally speaking, just lacks largesse. I'm very sorry, but you just hear Hooper's background in television. The minimalistic approach, the instrumentation.  It does, however, one thing that Patrick Doyle's score never could achieve: it sounds like Harry Potter. And that's why this score, while not particulary outstanding is at least sufficient and appropriate.    Nicholas Hooper is seemingly returning for Half-Blood Prince as well. Why is that?  Apparently the only demand the studio has for the composer is to not   completely suck. Don't get me all wrong, I'm happy for Nicholas Hooper that he found his way to the big screen, but it is apparent that the has no experience whatsoever with the medium. Do we really need to hear him practise in some of the most anticipated films in history? There are dozens of talented, experienced film composers out there that never got, and may never get, a shot at such a big budget project. That is not exactly fair. It's like the sudden rise of Gustavo Santaolalla, who was just attached to a prolific film.    In the end, Order Of The Phoenix is a good score, fitting for a Harry Potter film, but too small on thematic and orchestrational scale.   Although everybody wanted Nicholas Hooper to excel, it is what many feared it would be: a TV score by a TV composer.

0151013047|5.0|By now, you what the book is about. And you've heard the disagreements - fundamentalist, not so; controversial, innocuous; hate mail, balanced viewpoint; etc., etc. It seems like there is little left to say. But let me try and present some different perspectives on the book - things I see less talked about but which I believe are crucial to its understanding, interpretation, and appreciation.    So, let me start by stating the two key themes I am not going to be discussing: the sort of \\"coming-of-age\\" and maturing of an individual as a consequence of the social and political events around him, and the analysis of the transition that a society goes through as exemplified by the impact of some dramatic events on an individual or a family. I think both these themes are played out in this book, and played out very well like almost everything else in it, but they are still secondary themes. The real objective of the book I believe is to showcase the entire generation of \\"reluctant fundamentalists\\" that have spawned among Generations X&Y across the globe (primarily as a result of the huge economic disparities between the developed and developing nations, but that's an altogether separate debate and something I won't go into further here). These fundamentalists are not born so, they are not trained to be so, they often feel ashamed to be so, and are quintessentially not so, but nonetheless, when cornered, they become so as a natural outcome of some primal human behavioural traits like love for one's own and protecting of one's territory. These are the circumstantial fundamentalists. Changez is just one such man, and the dichotomy playing out in the minds of these reluctant fundamentalists is demonstrated in an excellent fashion through his actions in this book. Till he is cornered (metaphorically, when 9/11 takes place), he displays no fundamentalist tendencies. But once he is, some primal emotions surface. Thereafter, he and those around him get into a vicious cycle, as aresult of which he keeps getting pushed back more and more, and like most people, does not know how to respond except by becoming defensive, by retreating into familiar territory, and sometimes by lashing out in unjustifiable ways. Does he regret some of his reactions - absolutely, for he knows that some of them represent something inhumane and cannot be justified by any measures of morality. And that is the dilemma of the reluctant fundamentalist - the battle between the greater good and the smaller but more personal concerns. That is the dilemma every one of us is likely to face at some point in our life - protecting what is near and dear to us, or protecting what is right. That is the dilemma that Mohsin Hamid is trying to lay bare, and I think he does it fantastically.     There are two other aspects of the book which I'd like to briefly touch upon: the very interesting relationship between Changez and Erica, and also Erica's downward mental spiral. These are not key themes in the book, and to be honest, I don't believe are essential to the narrative of the book, but are still very well detailed and beautiful sub-stories in themselves which could have become good fodder for another book. These stories are really Erica's, as she gradually, not suddenly, loses her ability to deal with her dead lover, and how that loss affects her present relationships, especially with Changez. I thought this narrative was startling and beautiful, despite its inevitable tragic end.    In conclusion, I'd like to strongly recommend this book to all those readers who are trying to get some incisive and powerful insight into the minds of the quasi-fundamentalist behaviour being shown by many today. This book is not going to solve the culture-, religion-, or class-based clashes in the world today, but if it can help even a few people understand each other better, which I believe it will be able to, then it's a very worthwhile addition to the annals of literature.
0385522401|4.0|McEwan's novel is a wonderful brief sketch of the rich complexities of human interaction.  Despite great love for one another, Edward and Florence's day-old marriage dies due to a lack of proper communication and understanding.  Although all the action takes place on the evening of their marriage, McEwan mixes in a liberal sprinkling of flashbacks so that the reader fully understands each of their individual actions on that fateful night.  A seemingly-overly dramatic conclusion is understood and accepted because of our thorough knowledge of the main characters' backgrounds.  As in his earlier novel, Black Dogs, McEwan employs the technique of one fateful moment affecting -- in this case, irredeemably -- a couple's marriage.  Although the reader may understand the main characters' actions, it is still difficult to witness.  We want to push them back together to talk it through.  And whereas the reader may feel life shouldn't be as difficult as Florence and Edward seem to think it is, McEwan beautifully illustrates that it's not as easy as we would like it to be.

I hope they will think of making this the next movie, because this was really non stop adventure one after another, and twists in this story.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|After the triumphs of Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and his two excellent movies for children, I guess I had high hopes for Cuaron's version of CHILDREN OF MEN, and to a certain extent he overcomes the basic torpidity of its source material, PD James' futuristic 1992 novel warning of the upcoming infertility epidemic.  Cuaron plays the concomitant anti-immigrant hysteria thick and it becomes pretty much the dominant theme of the film, together with the use of torture and unjust captivity.  This leaves a few holes in the plot--or rather in the mise en scene.  In the world we see, the UK has embarked on a \\"Britain for Britons\\" political campaign in which people from every other country in the world are systematically denigrated in order to better capture and eliminate them.  In such a world, would \\"Baby Diego\\" become a natural hero--an Argentine?  Wouldn't the media focus be on the youngest-born British baby?  And yet we find out that Baby Diego is revered in England same as Princess Diana, people bringing flowers and spreading them out at Hyde Park like they did for Diana, choking up at his baby pictures as they did for Harry and Wills.  Somewhere there's a disconnect, although Cuaron's restless, inventive cinematographer rarely lets his camera rest long enough for us to ponder such subtleties--yet I think they manage to stick in one's subsconscious, burrs under the saddle, that somehow interfere with our reception of the film's many strong points.<br /><br />And those include . . . Cuaron's fluid direction, so that in the middle of epic battle scenes his camera will flutter and follow the progress of a single piece of cloth torn from a dead man's shirt across the dirty Bexhill Camp brickyard, or the scene, which could have been so groan worthy, where Michael Caine explains to Kee and Miriam what happened between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore years ago (the entire exposition), while Owen listens in, his face a rugged mirror for his pain and his unwilling rise to activism.  For in some ways it's a terribly written scene, saved by some great staging and acting, in other ways, we feel like we're watching cinema being invented all over again.  I wish Pauline Kael were alive to describe the exhilaration of watching, not a film about Abu Ghraib, but a film that dares invoke the spectacle of Abu Ghraib directly while \\"pretending\\" to be about how wonderful children are and how the sight of a human baby can reduce hardened battle veterans to genuflecting and making the sign of the cross.<br /><br />The boat thing, the baby thing, the rays of \\"hope\\" that punctuate the second half of the movie don't ring true, they aren't earned in the same way as the totalizing action of anti-immigration forces in the first half.  But that's just me and others will see this very differently.ays it's a terribly written scene, saved by some great staging and acting, in other ways, we feel like we're watching cinema being invented all over again.

0385340559|2.0|This is a pretty good book, although not up to par with most of Mr. Child's earlier books.<br /><br />But I am incredibly disappointed, because I feel as though he wrote the book about four people who had nothing to do with the Reach novels until his publisher said \\"Make it a Reacher mystery or it won't sell.\\" They were right. This isn't anywhere near as good as his usual work. Because the main character has Reacher's name and his tendency to be a hobo. But almost everything about him is completely different from the Jack Reacher we have come to know and love over the past ten years.<br /><br />This Reacher suddenly has a team that he worked closely with for a number of years before he got busted down to his last job. You'd think he might have mentioned this, maybe? With their slogan of \\"Nobody messes with ...[us,\\" I don't have the book right in front of me]. A team where each member would die for another? With that much importance, you think they wouldn't have maybe even be referenced?<br /><br />I don't think so.<br /><br />This \\"Reacher\\" is incredibly obsessive with numbers. Especially prime numbers. The only way to reach him is through number codes. It's almost all he thinks about, except for guns and sex.<br /><br />He's also dumb. He gets into situations \\"our\\" Reacher would never get near. This guy is predictable and lazy. I found myself getting angry at him. When I finished this book, I went back and read all of the earlier ones, just to make sure my memory wasn't playing me false.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Mr. Child. Stick to writing Jack Reacher mysteries - the REAL kind. It's what you do best.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is a film about the loneliness that comes with intellectual perfectionism. It begins with the voice of an off-screen female narrator as we watch IRS auditor Harold Crick start his rigidly prescribed daily routine. The film's plot turns on the fact that Harold, along with us, can hear the woman's overbearing voice, and can't help wondering if he or she is driving the events in his life. In fact, he's a character in her novel. It's reminiscent of The Truman Show, where Jim Carrey plays a similar role as an unwitting character in a reality TV show. Fortunately, playing Crick, Will Ferrell can convey real emotional depth along with his humor and his nuanced acting gives the film its emotional resonance.<br /><br />The novelist writing Crick's story, Kay Eiffel,  has writer's block because she sets too high standards for herself. Prof. Jules Hilbert, who Crick goes to for advice about narrative fiction, is a schlump of a guy who's constantly eating and fidgeting in an abject way that's at odds with his lofty intellectual ideals. Cricks's also a perfectionist (and very smart) in his own OCD way, but at least he doesn't suffer from Eiffel and Hilbert's sense of pompous self-importance.<br /><br />Crick falls in love with a woman he's assigned to audit--Ana, a Harvard dropout who runs a bakery. She's bought out of the academic and literary rat race that Eiffel and Hilbert are so invested in. But she has a rigidly left-wing political philosophy that's led her to withhold her taxes--she could end up in jail. Crick and Ana's love for each leads them to make a healthy compromise in their relationship and love each other despite their tempramental differences.<br /><br />Eiffel and Hilbert, both dowdy and unattached, serve as a cautionary tale to the younger Harold and Ana--this is what they could turn into if they don't unbend and accept their own and other's intellectual and personal imperfections. In the end, Eiffel confronts her personal isolation (maybe she and Hilbert will become an item) and decides that maybe writing an \\"okay'\\" novel instead of a masterpiece is acceptable. Life will go on. It might even go on better for her if she gives into a little greeting-card sentimentality now and then.nd decides that maybe writing an \\"okay'\\" novel instead of a masterpiece is acceptable.

B000002KIE|5.0|w#*#*r - FACT! I could write a serious review of the awesome musicianship of the music, the fabulous lyricalism of Lydon's lyrics or the tremendously meaningful significant influential and powerful socioeconomic and cultural impact this album had. But I'm not going to. That would be beside the point. If you don't like it f#*k o##.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|So much better than Octavarium that I can't express it. ......Have you ever heard Into The Arena , an instrumental by the Michael Schenker Group that is really good. Well , if you haven't , listen to track 7 here. It is a really great song that someone decided to stick a direct rip-off of Into The Arena right in the middle of. Some of the guitar parts are practically note for note. And -it just doesn't fit. what a way to ruin a very good original song. And yes , we all know how much you guys respect Metallica. But , those vocals didn't fit either. Despite these weird parts, this is one of their best ever and these guys live are always phenomenal. Try the new Symphony X if you like the heavier side of progressive ..it is killer.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Just let Paul Simon remaster it and add a few new redone tracks just for kicks! This is, perhaps, one of the top 100 greatest CDs of all time. Many times when artists(or \\"record companies\\") go back and \\"re-issue\\" good albums, they make them worse. Most times it's better to leave well enough alone. This is the exception. The remastering brings forward all the great and varied sounds of this album and the extra tracks are just a treat! Highly recommended!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has this sensual voice that you fall for within the first seconds of listening to her songs.<br />And this first album of hers is incredible! There is not a single song on the entire album that I don't like. And there are 12!<br />I totally recommend it to anybody, no matter what kind of music you like!
B000002KHH|5.0|Many would argue that this is the best Sabbath collection ever created. I would agree in that this is the Black Sabbath showcase, the mold, the direction  for which all later releases would follow. Where the superb debut album lacked direction, \\"Paranoid\\" picks up the slack: Ozzy found his vocal style niche, and the album's production and sound were now nailed down; we now hear well structured, polished songs rather than extended, sometimes aimless jams. It is hard not to compare this to the debut album since they were released within such a short period of time. To be fair, \\"Paranoid\\"  almost sounds like a different band. That's not to say the first album was poorly made, just different, perhaps even a bit more creative....Sabbath finding their way. Some may actually prefer the more raw debut effort, with it's \\"dirty\\" loose jam feel. With Paranoid, it's almost as if Sabbath were brought in off the street and given a shower, fresh new clothing, haircuts and a shave; the band was now flying in formation, and as a result, the songs as a whole are just a bit more listenable than the prior effort. Although most have heard this album countless times since its release, to this day it is hard to deny the magnitude of the triple punch of War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man and then  Fairies Wear Boots on side two when first heard. Side one of the vinyl, with the exception of \\"Planet Caravan\\" goes down as downright brilliant, albeit some may say musically overly simplistic.  The lesser known songs are also a treat, such as \\"Electric Funeral\\". All in all, no hard rock record/cd collection should be without \\"Paranoid\\".
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is her best album!<br />Her voice is unbelievable, the delivery is amazing and the lyrics are stunning!
B00013M6NK|5.0|I've used a lot of rechargeable batteries in various digital cameras.  Even with its compact size, this one performs and holds a charge well, and I'm surprised at the number of shots I can get on a charge. It also lasts longer than I expected in storage during times when the camera isn't used frequently. The two-hour recharging time is very reasonable.    You can get cheaper substitutes, but I wouldn't risk the electonics in my P5000 with an off-brand battery. And at $10, its very reasonable.
B000089RVR|4.0|This is a great album!<br />\\"White Flag\\", \\"Life For Rent\\", \\"This Land is Mine\\", \\"See the Sum\\" are songs you could listen to over and over. Her voice is as great as always and so are the lyrics!<br />I hope she'll keep coming up with new songs like these.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|This review refers to the Best Buy version with \\"Death from Above\\" at track 9. I'm not going to pretend that this album is as good as Mellon Collie, and maybe most SP fans will not like it as much as Siamese Dream (an album which seems to hold a special significance for people) or even Machina (at least for me), but it's still a really good album. Yes, there is a political vibe to some of it, but don't let these critics fool you, it's not Billy telling you what to think of anything. Listen to \\"United States\\" and you'll see it's more about the conflicted feelings we all have about the time we are in and the wanting to do SOMETHING besides ignore it all. Still, the political stuff is nowhere near as heavy handed as some have suggested. Now, there IS less of the melodic-type stuff on here - it's pretty much limited to \\"Neverlost\\" (which is a great song, btw), but there are only about 2 or 3 tracks I don't see growing on me (the last 2 particularly). And yes, it does feel a little weird knowing that James and D'Arcy aren't there, but if (like me) you were able to enjoy \\"Adore\\" without Jimmy then I'm sure you'll be fine with this too. Bottom line: If you ever liked Smashing Pumpkins and their music was more to you than just another musical product, then you will dig this enough.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This has 4 discs with 3 hours of film each so its in fact a very good bargain. But even if it isn't a bargain it would still be worth it. The pictures are absolutely amazing in standard definition alone, 10x better in blu-ray. While watching i actually felt like one of the animals was gonna jump out of the screen and into my living room. The time lapse photography, the exclusive shots of rare animals, and just contemplating the lengths the cameramen went through to produce it is incredible. Honestly you don't know how beautiful this planet is until you watch this documentary    Just the slow motion shot of the shark jumping out of the water to attack is worth $10.    Also this is the best blu-ray disc to showcase the power of your PS3 or justify the price of your bluray player. Its best when you have the broadcast version of one episode recorded on your DVR so you can demonstrate the difference to family members, friends, neighbors, or any skeptical person on the street by playing a clip simultaneously.    I guarantee they will be blown away. My uncle after just watching for 30 minutes went straight to Target and bought a PS3.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|Josh has put out another good album. I like it a lot more than the last two. The first Queens was classic material. The second Queens was very good as well, but the last couple of albums wasn't my personal favorite. Yeah, yeah, I understand why the artist has to change, and develope, and grow, and progress. Yata yata yata, this album is fun but I miss what Queens sounded like when they had just arose out of Kyuss. If you don't know Kyuss then do yourself a favor and find some.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a movie the whole family will enjoy, though parents may want to preview it first(PG).<br />It is a light-hearted comedy with a powerful message, the inference that we are here to help<br />our fellow travailers is abundantly clear, and like a great book, the meaning will change during<br />various stages of our lives.<br />Bring popcorn, but don't be surprised if you start examining your own life...<br /><br />On my list of top 10 movies of all time.<br />Buy it, keep it, watch it once a year - It is that good.
B000002LMK|5.0|I am on board with so many of the reviewers here who love Neil, find this among his best work, and cite how hard it rocks.<br /><br />All true.<br /><br />But it's lyrical and melodic and powerful and adult and moody and wistful in ways that grunge can never approach.  Grunge is little more than garage rock with better amps, and it does not do justice to Neil to call him grunge or compare him to grunge.  Men and boys, what that is.<br /><br />I need to listen a lot more to say that this surpasses Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, but I can mention it in the same breath.  The playing is probably better, but I don't know if the tunes are.<br /><br />No Neil Young fan should miss this collection.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|A movie that you won't forget.  I can't say my college days were anything like the movie, but this is how most people would want to remember the experience.  Every person in the movie is a person we have known - the class comedian, the jock, the coolest gal on campus...<br />Send the kids to grandmama's, draw the shades and turn up the volume, invite a few close friends over and enjoy.<br /><br />It is that fun, the DVD is a keeper (bottom shelf, locked drawer)...

1400103789|5.0|This CD Book (charmingly read by the author and his wife) is thought-provoking, and - to borrow Dawkins' words - conciousness-raising. Regardless of your religious inclinations, it is well worth the time and money. If you are religious, why not hear Dawkins' argument? The most interesting discussions are invariably with those who have a different viewpoint. If you are not religious, why not accept the author's invitation to ponder some big questions?   I find myself listening to the CD's over and over, each time noticing something new. Always being entertained.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|This CD is probably the best CD i've heard all year, well, besides the new chevelle record. But, i love this CD. It's different,but who cares. Every CD the Smashing pumpkins has had, it's different. I like all of their CD's. This CD is somewhat politically dark. The Guitars of Billy Corgan and the drumming of Jimmy Chamberlin is beautiful through out the CD. Especially the powerhouse \\"United States\\". 7 shades of black is my favorite sob giong of this CD. My second would have to be Bleeding Orchard. Then the rest fall in line. If this CD doesn't go platinum, then i will be upset. The music through out is extremely different, but change is good. Especially when you have billy corgan and Chamberlin behind it all. Great Job guys.

0140288503|5.0|This rates as one of the best military histories I have ever read.      Mark Bowden is scrupulously careful, balanced, and thorough.  He presents a very complex incident with color, passion, and detail, cataloging the sounds, smells, and visuals of this frightful engagement.    He allows the participants  among American and Somali soldiers and noncombatants to tell their own stories in their own words. Occasionally he steps back and presents historical/political background to let the reader see this \\"Battle of the Black Sea\\" in context.    The movie version (Ridley Scott directing) was exceptionally well done, fast-paced, fierce, gritty, and like the battle itself, ultimately very sad and leaving a sense of futility, given that the U.S. scampered out of Somalia shortly after the battle.  Yet the movie was light and almost careless of many details compared with this book.    Move over, Cornelius Ryan.
0440237688|3.0|I know this book is for teens so maybe i shouldn't even review it - but i thought it was too depressing for any age group, especially kids.  The utopia that this society has created is just weird and flat.  I thought the characters were like robots - including the main characters.  The ending bothered me - i don't want to spoil it, but i thought after such a flat world and existence that the main character should have at least found what he was was looking for. This is not a story that you walk away from feeling good.
0553588486|5.0|I picked up this book because so many people in the Fantasy forum here at Amazon loved it. I am so glad I listened to them. This book is huge, compelling, complex, and totally readable. There is so much going on at one time, but the author is so good at writing this story, that it is not confusing, you are able to follow everything that's going on. It is unlike any other fantasy I have read to date. It will eventually be a 7 book series, with the first 4 available now. I think any fantasy lover will enjoy this book, as well as non-fantasy readers. It really is a great read!
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Systematic Chaos has few defining features to separate it from the past 3 Dream Theater records. On a riff-by-riff basis, all but 2 of the tracks could have come from any other Dream Theater album released this decade. Yet those other 2 - The Dark Eternal Night and Prophets of War - are addictive enough to keep you coming back and spending enough time with this relatively faceless album to enjoy the rest of it.     In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 1 breaks from the last few Dream Theater albums by opening with a quick bass/guitar unison instead of a slow burn. Unfortunately, that's the last surprise that track has in store, as it proceeds to trot out the requisite Rush near-quotes (Natural Science here) and key-guitar unisons for 5 minutes of fairly dull instrumental meandering and 4 minutes of equally dull vocals. Forsaken is where a definite Euro-metal twist starts to come into play - a twist that gives the album most of its flavor. From the chilly piano intro to the pinch harmonic-heavy riff to the soaring, harmonized chorus, this one could have been written by Sonata Arctica, and that's definitely not a bad fit for Dream Theater. Tack on John Petrucci's best guitar solo on this record, and you have an early highlight. Constant Motion settles early into a straightforward thrash groove, and while drummer Mike Portnoy doesn't smother the groove in overplaying as he has sometimes been known to do, this one is merely solid.    The Dark Eternal Night is the first major highlight. Take one completely awesome guitar riff, add a rhythmic, aggressive vocal, toss in some actually exciting instrumental gymnastics in the middle (complete with Dream Theater's first Slayer-esque breakdown) and you have a killer song. It doesn't hurt at all that the lyrics dispose of DT's standard issue faux-introspective poetry and go straight for a far more entertaining tale of demons and monsters - Metallica's The Thing That Should Not Be is a clear influence, and a well-chosen one.     Repentance is a continuation of The Glass Prison/This Dying Soul/The Root of All Evil, and the first of those four to be a ballad. Unfortunately, it's lame, with an overplayed verse, an underplayed Floydian harmony section, and the biggest waste of prog-metal talent on record I've ever heard. Seriously, if you have the profound good fortune to have Mikael Akerfeldt and Steven Wilson as guests on your record, they should do something more than speak. Fortunately, this misstep is almost entirely forgotten by the end of the fantastic next track, Prophets of War. The mark of Muse is all over this, but thank goodness for that danceable beat, lo-fi mellow section, and big finish, thank goodness that DT wrote a set of political lyrics that actually aren't that far behind the times, and thank goodness that they seem to take a side with those lyrics. It's good fun.    The Ministry of Lost Souls is good - its balladry is suitably tender, its chorus is sufficiently huge. Unfortunately, long-time Dream Theater fans will recognize most of the playbook, and as a result this one doesn't wear too well. In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 2 is better than Pt. 1, mainly because it seems more tightly structured while at the same time visiting more places.    What's strange about this album is that I strongly disliked it on first listen, but came back for what I did like and wound up enjoying it - it has a better aftertaste than a foretaste. Systematic Chaos' most significant flaw is that long-time Dream Theater fans will know all its tricks - but then again, that's a pretty major flaw, because new fans shouldn't be starting here. I don't know whether I can properly recommend this one or not, because it could just as easily inspire strong dislikes. I enjoy it, though. Recommended tracks: Forsaken, The Dark Eternal Night, Prophets of War.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|First, I've been a Pumpkins fan since the release of Gish in '91.  I've seen them in concert  11 times.  I saw Zwan once.  Needless to say, I'm a big Corgan fan.  I'm a huge Jimmy fan - no other drummer can bring it as hard and heavy as Jimmy.  Adore was a really good album but Jimmy's absence was obvious.  As far as Zeitgeist, the first and most important thing to know, in my opinion, is that this must be listened to on a great home system with 2 speakers plus a sub (or if it's a really nice system with 5 or 7 speakers put it on \\"stereo\\" and not some surround mode) or on a great set of headphones.  When I first listened to the CD a couple days ago in my car which has seven speakers but is still a stock stereo system, the mix sounded odd.  The vocals almost seemed to be easily distinguishable and disconnected from the instrumentals.  I felt it lacked the vocal passion of other Pumpkins releases - I couldn't put my finger on it really.  Once I listened to it on my home system and especially on headphones, it felt totally different.  The vocals felt like they were immersed in the pulsating guitars and drums.  I became totally sold when I heard it this way.  I'm not a tech guy so I can't explain why but it's just a different experience with two speakers and a sub so avoid subpar systems if you want to hear this CD like it should be heard.  These songs will clearly rock in concert and I'm absolutely there.  One thing you won't get on this cd is the screaming growl we've come to know from Billy - \\"despite all my rage\\" (I wonder if maybe this was by design to make it possible for aging vocal chords to handle a world tour).  Nonetheless, these songs absolutely bring it.    1.  Doomsday Clock - The only way they could have started a Pumpkin comeback CD.  Jimmy kicks a** on this hard and heavy song that is part Mellon Collie, part Machina, part Gish (tinny guitars in parts), part more modern rock offerings (the chorus).    2.  7 Shades of Black - This sounds like an updatedBodies (disc 2 mellon collie) with more melody.  Rocks hard.  Very good.    3.  Bleeding the Orchid - This song sounds like an Adore song with what Adore was missing - Jimmy!  It has the same passion in the lyrics and vocals as Adore but it's complemented with great drumming that will have you doing the head bob :) and some heavier guitars.  Great song.    4.  That's the way (My Love is) - This definitely feels Zwan-like.  And all those out there who hate Zwan because it's \\"upbeat\\" take off your black clothes for a day and enjoy some positive energy.  Excellent song.    5.  Tarantula - Kill it, Billy!  This song is definitive Pumpkins.  In the end, Billy's layering of unbelievable guitar tracks is what has made the Smashing Pumpkins great.  This song has it all - screaming guitars, pulse-pounding drumming, screeching vocals, and even a pure Gish interlude - though brief it brings back memories.  Awesome song.    6.  Starz - This, to me, is like a totally new style of song for the Pumpkins.  It's a really good song that rocks with a great melody and some killer drumming by Jimmy.  I really enjoy this song.    7.  United States - Talk about a tune built for a concert.  It's a 9-minute ode to hard guitars and drumming.  It's definitely not Silverfu**, Geek U.S.A. , Soma, Tristessa, or Porcelina but I can't wait to hear it live!    8.  Neverlost - Very much an Adore feel.  Kind of like Crestfallen.  It's a sweet song and a good listen.    9.  Death from Above - This is the bonus song on the Best Buy CD.  I'm so glad I bought this CD because I love this song.  It's uplifting, beautiful, Adore meets Zwan.  I can't get enough of this great song.  It has everything I love about Billy Corgan combined with great Chamberlin drums.  It's like The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete (a song of personal significance to me) with a beat that just gets me feeling like I can't wait to start the day.    10.  Bring the Light - Has the Siamese Dream guitar sound with Zwan-like vocals and upbeat melody.  Another good song.    11.  (Come On) Let's Go! - Feels like another great Mellon Collie song.  It's a little more upbeat than most Mellon Collie songs but still has that same guitar and drum sound familiar to that album.  Excellent.    12.  For God and Country - I feel like Billy is really invested in this song personally but it's just an OK song.  It will probably be that one song on this CD that I hit the skip button on.  Listenable but not great.    13.  Pomp and Circumstances - This song reminds me very much of the great songs from Mellon Collie like Galapogos, We Only Come Out at Night, Beautiful, By Starlight, and Farewell and Goodnight.  A great song that I also can't wait to hear live.    14.  Stellar - This is the bonus song from iTunes.  An excellent song in the Adore style with great melody and passion.  The guitars are at times haunting.  Close your eyes during this one.    Overall, I'd rate Zeitgeist 4th on my Pumpkins best list (which means it's a GREAT album.  My order would be Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Gish, Zeitgeist, Adore, Mary Star of the Sea (Zwan but still Billy and Jimmy), Pisces Iscariot (basically a b-side ablum but full of great songs), The Aeroplane Flies High (a box set of singles with b-sides but with some great songs including the awesome \\"Cherry\\" and \\"Meladori Magpie\\", Machina (A few classics - Stand Inside Your Love is an all-time great - but too many so so songs), The Future Embrace (Billy's solo effort is a really enjoyable listen but not much more than that save the great \\"ToLoveSomebody\\" recorded with Robert Smith of The Cure).  Make sure you give this album seveal listens before deciding on how you feel about it.  It just gets better and better each time through.  Enjoy!
0061120073|5.0|This is an excellent coming of age book.  Every 'tween' should read this book.  It seems like I am buying a copy every year to give to a pre-teenagers.  This will never leave the Classics list.      Sonya Armfield
B000N6TX1I|1.0|There is a moment in this movie when one character gazes at the only living child in the post-apocalyptic world, and reports being amazed at how \\"tiny and beautiful\\" the baby is. Then he promptly turns to the window beside him and begins spraying machine gun fire into a crowd of cowering people. This is not an (intentionally) ironic moment, but it is characteristic of the unfortunate script of \\"Children of Men.\\"    While the set, costumes, and cinematography here are technically satisfying, the script is simply terrible. The film takes (advantage of) an interesting premise, but fails to deal with either the causes or the consequences of that premise. This is the sort of movie that should grow its own plot: why has England been reduced to this condition? What research have world governments been doing to investigate this matter? What caused all other countries in the world to collapse, leaving England to \\"soldier on?\\" Even more importantly, what effect does the lack of children have on characters' lives? How do they see and live their lives differently because of this circumstance? How does this affect their philosophies? Their (a)theism?     Granted, the film touches briefly on all these issues, but only superficially. Instead of showing the impact of the premise naturally through the characters, the script chooses to insert superficial visuals (what I would call \\"visual candy\\") to drive the point home. In one scene, a deer runs through the hall of a broken-down school. It's as though you can hear the filmmakers chortling to themselves, saying \\"Get it!? The schools are abandoned because there *are no more children!* The only sign of life in the school is a wild animal, because there *are no more children!*\\" They repeat this technique throughout the film with initially thought-provoking, but ultimately go-nowhere references to terrorism and immigration, youth-based advertising and political activism, but none of it affects the characters in any meaningful way, because it's all window-dressing for what is essentially an action flick dipped in gratuitous violence for no apparent reason. At one point during a battle-scene, the camera lens becomes flecked with blood, obscuring what is happening on screen. In truth, it's a good metaphor for the film in general.

0142004413|5.0|This book is captivating and plain funny. Whether you're an adult or a teenager, you will be consumed by Durrell's great description of his family life in Greece. You'll see the sights, hear the sounds and experience the smells through his teenage eyes. From the mystery of the rose-beetle man, to his distracted mother, and the various friends he makes in Greece, you'll love it ALL.<br /><br />When I first read this book, I couldn't put it down until the very end. And it introduced me to a whole new world of writing. Durrell's other books are lightweight (but just as amusing) compared to this one. It's a classic and deserves to be on every bookshelf.
B00001ZWTT|3.0|Big missed opportunity!  This movie had so much potential.  It seems as if the writers didn't give much thought to the plot.  Many parts seem \\"thrown in\\", as if we have to show this so lets put it in.  If they had just worried about telling a good story and not about having to show this character doing X and another character doing Y it could have been a terrific movie.  You may enjoy it once, however, you probably wouldn't want to see it again.
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|MIGHTY REARRANGER is a great Robert Plant CD, his second with Strange Sensation, which, unlike the musicians who backed him on his 80s/90s solo CDs, is a genuine band, much like Led Zeppelin was. This CD, like his five solo CDs of the 80s and 90s, continues to go where Led Zeppelin might have gone had drummer John Bonham been able to overcome his alcoholism. Anyone who loves Led Zeppelin will want this CD.
6305428387|4.0|Excellent movie based on a true story about a group of Jamaican athletes who come together under difficult circumstances to compete in the olympics as a bobsled team!  Very humorous, good comedy with very good acting. They picked all the right actors for each character.  There are obstacles to overcome amongst themselves, in addition to external forces.  You will applaud the ending!
B000JLQSW4|5.0|I ROBOT, the Alan Parsons Project's breakthrough album, has a title that was inspired by Isaac Asimov, and was originally supposed to be a concept album based on his writings. However, unbeknownst to Parsons and Eric Woolfson, Asimov had given exclusive permission to someone else to use his stories, and so the band were forced to keep the title (without the comma), and use a different concept, namely the tendency of people to act in a robotic fashion and to believe everything that advertisers and the business community says. This interpretation has inspired me to ignore commercial advertisers of unhealthy products so that I can look good for a number of pretty actresses. This is a CD which every serious progressive rock fan should own.
B000RJO578|5.0|This is the best comedy I've ever seen.    But don't go into this with high expectations. Instead, let it envelop you like a warm caress. You will not be disappointed.
1594489505|5.0|After picking this book up after dinner, I could not put it down. I stayed up until 4 AM finishing it.    What a haunting insight into lives that some people actually have to live. Hosseini's excellent descriptive style is just as beautiful as it was in 'The Kite Runner' ... if not better, and his narrative and execution of the story is, in my opinion, even more refined here.    I am not going to continue and summarize this book. To truly aprreciate it and experience its full effect, you must read it yourself.
1594489505|5.0|I didn't think Hosseini could write a story better than the Kite Runner, but for me, A Thousand Splendid Suns was even better. I couldn't put the book down and read it in two days! As with the Kite Runner, the story was well plotted and wrapped tightly. It shed much needed light on the plight of women in Afghanistan and put a face (although fictionalized) on the real victims of the constant political upheaval plaguing that part of the world.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Short story: Didn't like Britney. Gave this album a shot to see if it could change my mind. Like Britney less. Nuff said.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|This film had a lot of hype behind the trailer, which was one of the best in recent years.  With a remixed version of a Nine Inch Nails track, we were thrown into the epic battle between Spartans and Persians.<br /><br />I found the acting to be effective when they were in battle or trying to rile up the troops.  However, the performances in the 300's Senate were woeful compared to that of Gladiator's Derek Jacobi and Joaquin Phoenix.  Thankfully, it doesn't linger too long on the acting.  The action is beautifully choreographed, albeit gory at times.<br /><br />As for the HD-DVD format, I'm really looking forward to seeing the blue screen picture-in-picture feature in parallel to the film.  For all the juvenile Blu Ray fanboys, that is a feature they will not be getting.  Picture quality will be an exact digital duplicate VC-1 encoding.  The only plus of the Blu Ray version is an extra PCM track, but the difference between Dolby TrueHD and PCM is negligible to any average consumer and even most audiophiles.  If you have the option of either format, you'd have to be stupid not to buy the HD-DVD version for the P-I-P feature unless you are blind.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is, in my opinion, Smashing Pumpkins' best album. \\"Gish\\" and \\"Mellon Collie and Infinite Sadness\\" are also good, but this is their masterpiece. Still has a unique sound to me- imagine how unique it was then...
B000BB14YY|5.0|This is the only DVD in which I've ever \\"doubled dipped\\".  I had the original Fox Lorber DVD, which was atrocious, even by Fox Lorber's horrible standards.  They were issuing DVD's when the DVD format first started out, and nearly 90 percent of their transfers were wretched, like the one for Ran.  Luckily, Criterion restored this film (along with Kagemusha) to a proper, 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The older DVD copies had a black bar across the bottom of the screen, but not one on the top (resulting in an awkward transfer), and the subtitles weren't the greatest either.  There were no extras (except for a trailer and a very scant filmography).  Now, with the Criterion edition, you get a great transfer (this is the first time I've seen the film properly), and you get Chris Marker's great documentary A.K. (on the 2nd disc).  Marker's documentary reminds me of Wim Wenders's wonderful Tokyo-Ga, which was made a few years earlier than A.K. (and has a very rare cameo by Marker himself, who is notoriously shy).  It's fascinating to see Kurosawa do his magic, and I've always liked older filmmaking documentaries, because they were generally rare in those days, and most of them are done in a very cinematic style (and people don't play for the cameras).<br /><br />As for the film itself, it's Kurosawa's greatest work (made when he was 75).  Kurosawa did make 3 films after this one (Dreams, Rhaspody in August, and Madadayo), and while they're great (especially Dreams and Madadayo), this was really Kurosawa's last great epic film.  It's my favorite Kurosawa film and one of my top ten favorites.  This is a masterpiece, and the Criterion DVD does it justice.
B000001EEN|5.0|Great concert with a great set of songs- classics! This album just kept growing on me and didn't leave the CD player for months. You really get a sense of Eric's ability to play/sing different styles (blues, rock, etc). The musicians he plays with on this album are all top-notch. The recording quality is a little off but I kinda like the \\"bootleg\\" quality it has. The \\"After Mignight\\" on here is the best I've ever heard. It's got a real raw sound that you don't get from either of the studio/radio versions I've heard. The \\"Let It Rain\\" version on here is also awesome, with a drum jam in the middle of it. If you're an EC fan, especially of his older material, you must have this! If you're a fan of 70's rock and/or blues this is also strongly suggested.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I went to see Wicked at the Victoria Apollo Theatre in London last weekend. I had been playing this cd for a couple of weeks so that I knew the music beforehand and, although the vocals are not bad, it doesn't come anywhere close to the performance by Kerry Ellis. She is absolutely superb & if you get the chance to see her then you should jump at it. I hope that a Wicked cd featuring her is produced as this one has lost it's charm a little after hearing her.
B0000027RL|5.0|One of the best albums off all time, seriously. This album meant so much to me when it first came out. It really spoke to me at that time in my life. Years later I find it is still a solid album. Your collection needs this album :)
B000MQC9H4|4.0|A very light, romantic comedy. Although the plot and premise are very simple, it kept my interest clear through. Of course, Jude Law isn't that bad to look at for 2 hours, either.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|This soundtrack is a wonderful addition the the Harry Potter musical library.  It has a more mature tone to it than the previous offerings, and it delivers on capturing the moments within this film.    My only complaint falls on Warner Bros. Records decision to publish this soundtrack seriously out of order.  I like to listen to the musical score of a film and have it in film order.  Warner Bros. has decided to jumble this score to pieces.  From having the Hall of Prophecy track as track 6 to having the Flight of the Order of the Phoenix as the 2nd to last track, this soundtrack is an utter mess.  It will take me several viewings to determine the \\"correct\\" order and make my own copy of the soundtrack.
B00005JPFC|4.0|Being a big kid myself, I went to see this one with another adult friend. Sure, lived through the back of my seat being kicked by a small child throughout the entire movie...but you'll have this.<br /><br />Anyway, what a delightful movie! If you don't fall in love with Remy within the first 5 minutes, you're not watching the movie.<br /><br />Take the kids or take yourself to see this one! Wonderful for all ages!
0385339704|5.0|The Pelican Brief is absolutely filled with suspense, and a plot that will leave you guessing at every corner. Truly hard to put down, even when the digital clock says its 2 a.m. This novel contains every single Grisham quirk which readers delight, whilst deviating from Grisham's usual court-room sanctum.     Tulane law student Darby Shaw has unknowingly stumbled upon an incredible discovery: the true identity of the man who orchestrated the heinous killings of two Supreme Court justices. Now the killer, an huge oil mogol, will stop at nothing to silence anyone who comes in contact with the highly incriminating evidence: the pelican brief. Already Shaw's professor and lover has been murdered, and the body count is yet to climb. Darby is on the run and has become increasingly paranoid. Only one person who holds a critical link to the crime is able to help her: Gray Grantham, a Washington Post writer. Darby must now choose between fleeing the country for her safety, or riding shotgun with Grantham who is dead-set on exposing the killer in what proves to be a wild and dangerous ride that eventually brings down the Presidency.     The Pelican Brief is not a novel to ignore. Grisham readers and those not familiar with his works will undoubtedly be drawn into his world.
1594489505|5.0|You know those movie scenes that are so real and painful that you have to look away?  There are parts of this book that made me feel that way, yet I couldn't.  While this book is fiction, women are out there--many of them--sharing the same plight as Laila and Mariam.  Their strength is admirable.  This book grabbed me from the first line and shortened my sleep time by hours.  I hesitated starting it b/c I knew it would be heavy reading, but while it was very serious in nature, it was not hard to follow.  As soon as I finished it I called a friend, who is an avid reader and told her to go and buy or check out this book immediately!  READ IT!  You won't be sorry.  I have not read the Kiterunner yet but it is next on my list!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|Well, I've long since stopped mourning the loss of John Williams from the Harry Potter series. After composing the best score yet for \\"Azkaban,\\" the prolific Williams left the Harry Potter fandom to wallow in the cutesy waltzes and themeless chromatic atmospherics of \\"Goblet.\\"    But \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" sees yet another composer: Nicholas Hooper. I'll admit I was wary at first (I believe I wrote a blog on him a long time ago), but after listening to the entire score streaming through AOL Music, my opinion has changed.    Although nowhere near the quality of Williams, Hooper brings a new atmosphere to the soundtrack series. Although his darker tracks like Darkness Takes Over and Possession may get a little boring with the endless, near silent violin tremolos, puncuated by the occasional bang that makes you jump out of your seat, it's the lighter tracks and the more emotional core of the soundtrack that really impressed me.    For the first time in the entire series, Hooper has hesitantly used a piano at the forefront of one track, accompanied by violins, and the result is heart-wrenching. Recorded beautifully as well, I reluctantly say that these bits may have served the Mirror of Erised scene in \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" much better than the numerous repetitions of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" or \\"Harry's Wondrous World.\\" I wish Hooper had used more solo piano on the album as it is some of the best stuff on there. Another emotional point in the album uses the flute and soaring violins, possibly to depict Harry and Sirius's close relationship.    The opening cue, Fireworks, is comparable to the Quidditch World Cup cues from \\"Goblet.\\" Staunchly Irish in its rhythms and melodies, the cue has an energy to it befitting the scene which it scores.    The Dumbledore's Army music is some of the best, and really suggests a fun time, with great learning, and underscores the idea of a rebellion, but not something like Guy Fawkes, but something you'd expect from school kids. I sorely wish Hooper had expanded on that more, but sadly, you only hear about a minute of it on the entire album.    The Umbridge music fits very well, even if it is a bit reptitive, but I really liked the Room of Requirement music (which has been incorrectly named the Room of Requirements). It's mysterious and quirky at the same time, and evokes a hidden, ancient magic that has a mischeivous mind of its own. And knowing that Hooper will probably be back for \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" because the David Yates, the director will as well, I know he'll be able to weave the slightly naughty Requirement theme into a much darker tapestry when Malfoy uses it to break into Hogwarts.    One great aspect of the score is Hooper's willingness to revisit Williams' lasting mark on the score: Hedwig's Theme. He uses it subtly, but noticeably, paying homage to the old master, but also varying it and changing its mood from dark to light to moody where it is needed.    The music for the famous kissing scene suffices, in my opinion, and I'm sure it works well with the on-screen visuals, but I don't feel the magic in it very much, or nearly as much as I did when I read the scene in the books. I think it could have done with a few more flute trills and runs, possibly some soaring violins to depict the fluttering of Harry's heart, but it's a much slower, calmer piece with a few long chords and modest bells.    The driving music found in the climactic cue Sirius Deception really reminded me a great deal of the better action movies of late. I can't wait to hear it in conjunction with the film's visuals. I can just see Harry and co. marching down to the forest and then soaring away on the thestrals, whose music gives me goosebumps, because it really feels like an epic flight. Next to Williams' amazing cue Buckbeak's Flight in \\"Azkaban,\\" I'd say this cue comes closest to matching that swooping feeling in the pit of your stomach when you soar into the air.    The cue for the death of the major character (I won't spoil it for those that haven't read the book) is very unsatisfying. It is one of those moments where dark atmospherics take precedence over melody, and as a result, the emotional impact that the cue should have is conspicuously absent. I'm sure it works well in the film, but I still would have expected something more gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. Then the cue launches into an ugly boisterous section which I can only imagine depicts Harry launching himself into a heated duel with Bellatrix. I can only describe it as noisy. In its final moments, the cue tries to become emotional, but it doesn't try hard enough and it only sounds like a weak attempt at tears.    Being a flute player, I love the opening of Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning, because it is a lovely flute serenade, which then breaks into a string pizz version of Umbridge's bouncy, insidious theme.    The Ministry of Magic music is very funny in its quirky, bouncy sense, and is almost reminiscent of Sorcerer's Apprentice. Although I would not have thought the Ministry of Magic would warrant bouncyness, perhaps the method in which it is depicted calls for such motifs. The amazement at the Ministry's massive size is somewhat poorly scored, relied on somewhat idiotic downward arpeggios that seems a bit obvious. The mischief continues through to the end of the track, however.    The one thing that annoyed me was how the music for Trelawney being sacked fit more with the emotional impact of the big death in the film.    The Flight of the Order of the Phoenix, which depicts the Order's picking up Harry and flying back to headquarters, was okay in the sense that it was flying music, but it somehow felt too ordinary.    The horn is also used to create a sense of deep, tragic loss, and great scope, as it always will be, but its effect is somewhat diminished as Hooper shies away from the more soaring, incredible chords and triads that the horn does so well with.    The ending of the album finally hints at a somewhat great, emotional, soaring happiness, but it is never fully developed to be truly appreciable.    I know I make it out to be a horrible album, and I admit, if it wasn't Harry Potter, I would not have picked it up. I only feel that it doesn't come anywhere close to the perfection that was \\"Azkaban.\\" Having said that, this score really isn't too bad, although the current masters of today like Elfman, Williams, and (I can't believe I'm saying this, but the Pirates 3 score was phenomenal) Zimmer would easily have done a better job, I think Hooper has done an admirable job of rescuing the score from Patrick Doyle.    An essentially dark score, puncuated by light, bouncy, quirkiness, the music shines at certain moments and snores at others. Overall, I would give it a 7 out of 10.    ~ Adhish
B000001FY9|5.0|I will never grow tired of \\"Legend.\\" This compilation is absolutely perfect, providing an accurate insight into the musical genius that was Bob Marley. This isn't just reggae at its finest, but it's music at its finest. The songs on \\"Legend\\" can be inspiring, uplifting, entertaining, thought-provoking, but most of all just purely enjoyable. The simple songwriting and talented musicianship provide a sunny, lighthearted musical setting, the laidback Caribbean style that would inspire a generation of reggae followers. But it's Bob's messages and lyrics that set him apart from the other great Jamaican musicians who were his contemporaries. Bob's music is at times politically and religiously charged, and sometimes just for fun. But everything he advocates in his muic is positive. He wants the world to be a better, friendlier place, and he advocates human treatment and equality, civil rights, and freedom. He portrays his ideas in a simple manner that makes them all the more effective. This compilation covers the most audience-friendly and appealing of his extensive discography. This is a smart purchase, because Bob's discography is huge, especially because there are so many various releases that have surfaced between different distributors in different countries. \\"Legend\\" is an album everyone should own, it's the one that every new Bob Marley listener should not even think twice about purchasing, and everyone should be able to appreciate the music here.<br /><br />The compilation begins with \\"Is This Love,\\" one of the most purely roots songs here, a lyrically simple, musically catchy tune. \\"No Woman No Cry\\" is my favorite song of Bob's music, and this seven minute live recording is beautiful. The lyricism of this song is simple but really moving, from his talk of growing up poor in Jamaica to his philosophies on life, and the break for the guitar solo and background vocals complete the beautiful arrangement. I absolutely love \\"Could You Be Loved,\\" a clever production that's immediately catchy, with a great chorus and standard Bob Marley performance. \\"Three Little Birds,\\" one of his most well-known tunes, is fun, light, and fairly uplifting. \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" is an ingenious look at the movement of peoples from Africa to the Caribbean, and Bob praises his ancestors. The politically-fueled \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\" is a very effective rallying cry for civil rights. Another of my favorites is the winding \\"Stir It Up,\\" a laidback, enjoyable and fun song. \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\" is a happy call to equal treatment and some light philosophy, one of his most definitive songs. If you haven't, you must hear his ingenious cover of Eric Clapton's \\"I Shot the Sheriff,\\" which is followed here by the easy \\"Waiting in Vain\\" and the very inspired \\"Redemption Song.\\" \\"Satisfy My Soul\\" and the incredible \\"Exodus\\" follow, with another of my favorites, the unforgettable \\"Jamming.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line, this album is a must have for anyone.

0393061434|5.0|Steve Wozniak, the engineer chiefly responsible for the original Apple I and II, recounts his view of the events leading up to the founding of Apple Computer, and beyond.     Clearly, his knowledge of electronics, his desire to build a working personal computer, his experience at Hewlett-Packard, and his hard work all came into alignment to produce (and then sell) the Apple I, with invaluable help from, of course, Steve Jobs. In this book, Woz conveys the excitement and satisfaction of achieving critical goals in refining the PC design and the PC-user interface that we all now take for granted.     The consummate engineer, Woz avoided \\"management\\" like the plague. He was the man behind the curtain, especially regarding the design of the insanely great Apple II, which was critical in getting Apple Computer off the ground.     Woz occasionally reflects on his nerdiness and unwillingness to abandon his love for math and science in order to socially \\"fit in\\" while while in his teens. All of us nerds who are drawn to this book can likely relate. A familiar, but sad, commentary on the American \\"culture\\".     The last third of the book dwells on the decade or so after the initial, phenomenal success of Apple and how Woz dealt with his new wealth - mainly by spreading it around for fun and educational enterprises. He also tells about other entrepreneurial endeavors outside Apple, his take on Apple sans Jobs during the early 90's, and on Apple after the return of Steve Jobs.     This is an highly enjoyable, nerdy autobiography - somewhat adolescent in attitude, not too intimate or personally revealing, enthusiastically technical in places, with a hearty and prankish dose of distrust of authority.

0788815490|3.0|I gave it a 3 because I could not give it a 3.5.    I turned it off the first time I watched it because I did not like the first 20 minutes.  About a week later I watched it and went through the whole thing.  The scenery is great.  I do watch movies for that but I expect a great performance.  I do not blame the actors.  I believe it was beyond their control.  Not a bad flick.  It was worth the money I paid for it.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|First of all we should only review the music nothing else is the only interest of making a review of an album the MUSIC...well all i can say what we have here is great music Corgan try to make a very heavy album and he sucededs. The best tracks in my on opinion are the ones produced by Roy Thomas Baker witch have a more melodic felling in them (6,9,12)maybe he should have produced more tracks of the album because these tracks are superb and give something new to the smashing universe besides the heaviness that we find in the album. Lets see if this new smashing beggin is to last but one thing for certain the music in this album is very good and deserve a chance!!The smashing pumpkins legacy is very well preserved here no doubt, i seen future in here!!And to some people that in this moment dont no that seamise album Corgan played all instruments besides the drums the same in Meloncoly beside the fact that all music was written by Corgan so i dont seen how people think that James iha and darcy are missed here when in the first place they didnt writte almost any smashing songs!! Billy Corgan was and is the smashing pumpkins and we all know that!
B000000W5P|4.0|Some Girls, is one of the greatest Rock n roll cds. The Stones rock with some of their best guitar Shattred, Lies, Some Girls, Respectable and When The Whip Comes Down are all great Rock n roll.  Far Away Eyes is the only country its lighter than the great stones country. Miss You is a great song great sax solo from Mel Collins and Hamonica from Sugar Blue. Some Girls is one of the stones Five best a great guitar based Rock n Roll cd from The Rolling Stones.
0751532711|1.0|I must be a genius because everything I learned from this book I already knew.  The only think I learned from this book is that I need to start investing.  Wow! Thanks!  I already knew that.  I guess I was looking for a book that would educate me and give me some real life examples of how to accomplish this objective.  However, the only advice I received from this book was that I needed to become financially educated and that I should read more books.  Not to sound too sarcastic, but that is why I purchased this book.  I can read a million books about finances and if they have as much sound advice as this book did, I will die a very poor man.      If you want an entertaining book, this is the book for you.  However, If you want a book that gives sound financial advice with the instruction manual, you better keep shopping.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|This seems to be a common compliant about this record, that it isn't a true Pumpkins album because D'Arcy and Iha didn't participate.  Who cares?  If some of these people were aware with how the Pumpkins recorded their previous albums they'd know that Corgan did virtually everything except for drumming.  Thus Iha and D'Arcy had little studio input into the previous records and using that as a  point to attack Corgan is both unfair and ignorant.  Honestly half of the negative reviews here are nothing but attacks on Corgan himself instead of giving this fantastic record's songs a chance.  This IS the Smashing Pumpkins and in my opinion it's their best album since Mellon Collie.
B00000ILGX|4.0|Certain songs should have been on this CD, I was a little disppointed they weren't on it. I ended up tracking down an \\"Out Of Print\\" copy for Wham! The Final on ebay instead. That Album was hard to come by, yet one song out of 2-3 were actually on this one. I'm happy about that. This CD isn't bad, just wished it had more of the songs I remembered listening while growing up.
B000OLGCHA|4.0|I love John Williams' music for the Harry Potter soundtracks and was disappointed he wasn't the composer for Goblet of Fire. I wasn't sure what to expect with the 5th movie, but I am happy with the result this time! It matches the moods in the film nicely and is great for just listening on its own. I have to add that I do not favor the Goblet of Fire soundtrack very well... thought it had too much high volume instrument noise and not enough variety in sound. This one does have a variety of sound and personality and is a pleasure to listen to. The Order of the Phoenix soundtrack is just what I was hoping for!  I just have one comment, and the reason I gave it 4 stars: why on earth is it out of order? I had thought movie scores follow the fluidity of the movie itself... I could be wrong but I thought the first 3 followed an order... and the Goblet of Fire music seemed to follow the movie order except for the Yule ball tracks at the end, which was a smart move. OoP soundtrack starts with Fireworks, which I think is a great track, but the music actually occurs at a later point in the film itself. A bit weird.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|I became a Lost fan this last December. I bought Season 1 on dvd just because I had heard so much about it and was curious. I was hooked from the first episode. Not a single time during season 1 was I disappointed or get bored.     Then I bought season two. Everyone that I knew who had already seen season 2 warned me that it was horrible. One friend told me that on a scale of 1-10, season 2 was a 4. That's awful! Most told me not to expect much, that I would be very disappointed, and so forth. So I watched, with low expectations, and I ended up loving it. I think it's because my expectations were SO low that I had no where to go but up with the show. There were some things I didn't like about season 2 - them replaying one scene over and over again through a different persons point of view was irritating and felt like a waste. Overall though, I enjoyed season 2.     For season 3, a friend of mine downloaded the season and we watched it together. I HATED about half of season 3. It was so boring! I didn't like that the survivors were all seperated now. I was getting REALLY irritated with Kate. I was just not happy at all. It felt like the show was not progressing at all for me until about mid-way through and it felt as if a the show had just taken a shot of espresso. It picked up so fast and got so damn good that I felt like screaming, and crying, at the end of season 3.     This show is definitely my favorite show right now. I am aware that I have to trust the writers and be patient. It kills me when the audience gets an answer to a question only to receive 3 more questions in return, but it makes the show SO much fun.     I will definitely buy this season when it comes out. I will probably re-watch ALL of the seasons before Season 4 begins just to refresh.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nina Simone's but didn't really make an effort to seek out Arie's music until I heard a clip of \\"I am ready for love\\". I was instantly sold and knew that I had to have the cd and boy, does she deliver! It's soulful, intelligent, and just plain groovy. This is a musical artist who will always deliver whether or not the results are 'pop' catchy. Enjoy!
B000EDWL82|4.0|This is another album that I bought on a whim, primarily from hearing the tune \\"Munich\\" on the radio.  I ended up loving the whole album. Very strong. One could probably say that the band's sound is a hybrid of U2, The Doors, and some others.  I think their sound is compelling. The more I listen to this album, the more I like it.
B00004I9VE|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the best album Michael Jackson has made with every song on it a Top-10 song.  I have the record (LP), the CD, and hoped getting a 5-channel sound with this SACD.  Disappointingly enough, this SACD comes with 2-channel sound only, which is definitely not better than the regular CD. Five stars for the music, zero stars for audio quality.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|OMG I love Madonna. She has never sounded better on a CD. This is like, the best one.<br /><br />Madonnas the kind of girl who you'd meet in a record store, and you'd ask for her phone number, and then she'd act all Madonna-ish and blow you off, and you leave the record store loving her more than ever. I mean, haven't we all met someone like that?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Madonna's new album totally, like, rocks. I mean, her biggest hits are here, and the cover of the album is nice. Im thinking if she didn't hook up with Britney Spears, she would have at least made a couple of good rock albums like this one. Who knew she had it in her?<br /><br />I think Madonna's dad would be proud that she finally abandoned her pathetic attempts to be a dancer and made some really sweet dance music like this one.<br /><br />Amazing! Isn't life crazy?!
B000KCHZK6|3.0|In my opinion, this CD is simply not as strong as her first two CDs.  Most of the songs are fine, but forgettable.  A couple are just a bit weird-sounding for my taste. Out of her 3 CDs, I preferred \\"Come Away With Me\\", although I understand that Ms. Jones feels that her current CD is a truer reflection of her musical style.    Right after I bought this CD, I was privileged enough to see her in concert.  She is clearly talented, and has an accomplished band.  The concert was wonderful and was over before I knew it. Her performance got rave reviews in the local newspaper the next day.    I look forward to her next release, mostly to see how her artistic style evolves.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|As a 'catch-up' Lost fan, can someone tell me how to get Season 3 before Season 4 starts?  I recently watched Seasons 1 & 2 on DVD...and would like to get through Season 3 before the next one starts.  Thanks!!
B000002IAS|5.0|This recording is positively alive with supercharged energy.  It is not only brimming with fine performances from many of the hottest musicians of the time; it serves as proof-positive that white kids can, indeed, superbly play blues and soul music.  It captures the raw energy of the ensemble performances of the (then) husband-wife team of Delaney and Bonnie Bramblett, and the exceptional backing musicians who would eventually turn up on the albums of countless other stars for another 20 or more years.    Put it in, turn it on, crank it up, and shake your booty to every tune on the CD (you can't resist going dance crazy, anyway).  Don't let this one get by you.  Get it while it's still in print.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|This is an album that I can listen to all of the time. You have to like buble or the old big band cronie. Very good
B000I5XDXS|4.0|Despite what the others mentioned I did like the sound (admittedly you need to turn the volume up to get the real good sound) as well as the picture quality, even though it's presented in 1080i only, but hey, that's definitely good enough for a concert video.  \\"Africa\\" comes in awesome, and so does \\"Rosanna\\".  Would have appreciated \\"Child\\" as a separate tune indetad of being a part of a medley.  Still, definitely 4 stars.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|Wow, I can't believe all the glowing reviews for this album.<br /><br />Heres my quick review of it - you don't have to agree with everything I'm saying:<br /><br />1. If you likes the White Stripes work so far, then you would love this. Its more of the same, nothing Groundbreaking, nothing revolutionary.<br /><br />2. This is one of those `flavor of the month' albums that garner a lot of blog praise, but later in the year no one will even remember it.<br /><br />3. Though some of the rock tunes here are good (in an `averagey' sort of way), none of them are memorable (even after three listens)<br /><br />4. Theres this OVERWHELMING feeling of `been there, done that'. In fact, the entire album sounds very tired to me.<br /><br />5. You could do much better than fall for the hype.<br /><br />I would highly recommend the new Smashing Pumpkins album, or even the Sara Bareilles album over this one, anyday.<br /><br />Two Stars. Skip this one.
0767827902|5.0|Sonny (Tim Bottoms) can barely get his truck to run in the dusty, dilapidated Texas town of Anelene, in the opening scene.  His physical impotence, furthermore, is manifested by his inability/unwillingness to tackle his opponents when playing on his high school football team.  But, despite his gentle-natured passivity, things soon get moving for him and his life  becomes increasingly complex.  In the process he looses his virginity, but ironically retains much of his innocence. His relationship with the elderly Sam the Lion, and with the mentally handicapped Billy demonstrate his guilelessness.  Other characters--Jayce, Duane, Lois, Abilene and others--reveal their flawed moral character.       Sex, and in practically every imaginable variety makes up a big part of this coming of age film.  The rich kids, the poor kids, the handicapped kid, the preacher's kid, and those who aren't kids anymore.  Infidelity, bestiality (\\"my uncle has a heifer\\"), group nudity, pedophilia, and prostitution.  But it was done in a such an artful manner that the film has naturalness and continuity.  Based on the eponymous novel by Pulitzer Prize winner Larry McMurty, it is definitely a literary film.    I think this movie well made.  The black-and-white filming is quite effective, the acting is excellent, and the artistic aspects make it worth watching.  Again.
0143038419|5.0|Many of my girlfriends and I adore this book.  It is inspirational, but in a real-life sense.  There is also a great deal of beautiful imagery that will inspire you to quit your jobs to travel.  This is one of those rare books that, after you finish, you feel more centered and feel inspired to create positive change in your life.  The book is also humourous, and the author is a bit of a sass!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Bought this for my wife. It is best version out there. Toby has replaced Collin firth with my daughters :)
075640407X|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long, long time.  I find myself thinking of Kvothe and, of course, wanting to know MORE!      The cover of the UK edition is beautiful...    TMG
B000PY52EU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Great story, great music.  I nominate Ricci for Best Actress right now.    p.s.  I also bought the soundtrack.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Yes I will have to agree with the minority of reviewers that say that the second half of the CD is the best one, if Julian and the boys were experimenting well I did work bacause I found myself listening to these songs more often, Ize of the World, 15 Minutes, Fear of Sleep and the rest of the second half are truly great songs and fit with my taste, this coming from someone that considers himself intelligent and with  a  great and eclectic  musical taste ,OK I also like the first half specially track number 6 Vision of Division. I will also say that I own this CD since its release in early 2006.<br /> I just dont understand the people that downgrades this album, if this would have sounded like the previous two they would have complaint that they just do more of the same , and now that they changed the direction a bit they want the sound of the other records...everyone grows , you do not think the same things you did 3 or 5 years ago , everyone changes a bit and I am happy to say that I like the new direction the Strokes went.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|This shows what television is capable of, but all too rarely tries to be. I knew of this show from the book and tried (with many others) to get it on American TV. The three networks (there were only three then) all said that no one would watch a show where you had to think. PBS picked it up and proved them wrong!    For a long time this was available only on DVDs marketed to the educational field, and Ambrose priced it accordingly (high! high! high!), so I am glad to see that while it is still not cheap, it is cheaper than before. I still have my grainy VHS tapes that I recorded many years ago from TV and now plan to finally replace.     I would heartily recommend this series to any lover of knowledge and great TV shows.
0553296981|5.0|Although I read this originally in seventh grade English class, re-reading this as an adult was even more moving. When I was twelve I didn't know what words like 'Gestapo' meant or 'The Third Reich'...in fact, I hadn't grasped the magnitude of The Holocaust until I was much older. There were so many ways that at twelve-years-old I could connect with Anne Frank, but as an adult (although the same pre-teen connections were there),  my perception of who Anne Frank was changed drastically. I had been fascinated by her diary since I was twelve, and visited The Secret Annex in The Netherlands twice in an eighteen-month span. I strongly recommend to anyone who had a fascination with Anne Frank when they were younger, to read it again as an adult.
0131479415|5.0|Mike Cohn comes up with another gem of a book to assist technology development teams in creating the right products in a timely fashion for today's fast paced world.  If you're in the web 2.0 space where continuous innovation is the norm, then this is a must read book.  Even if you're in the more traditional industries developing products, this book will be a great help for you whether you've already made the jump to agile development or are considering it.    One thing not covered in this book, but is a must for making any significant change in the way that your staff performing their jobs is to make sure that you're prepared for it.  If you're considering making the jump to agile development, I strongly urge you to first consider the people side of change management to make sure that your company and teams have the support that they need to make and then maintain the change.  I guarantee that there will be resistance to switching to Agile development from some portion of your team, so be prepared for it by doing your own research into change management.  A possible suggestion would be a Prosci Change Management course, but there are others.    Once you've done your preparation for managing the people side of change management, then Mike's book is then a great cookbook on the methodology of succeeding at Agile development.  It contains real world examples and suggested best practices to help your teams succeed and have fun doing it.
0385338694|5.0|This was the first book that I read by Sophie Kinsella and I loved it!  The book was an easy read (which made it great for summer vacation!).  It was one of those stories that takes you away from reality (I agree - the story is very unplausible!) and gives you many laughs throughout the way.  Pick up this book if you are looking for some light, funny, silly and fun reading!
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I bought Kelly Clarkson cd My December thinking it would be a good cd.  I was so disappointed in this one.  I bought the cd Breakaway before   I thought that was good. My December did not rank up there with Breakaway.  I would not recommend this one to buy  it would be a waste of money.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|What the heck happened to their music?  I was a big fan but this new album is stupidly political and is just plain horrible.  Their single on the album is the only mildly LP style song on the album.  LP obviously went soft and pop.  LINKIN PARK, SOME ADVICE: GO BACK TO THE WAY YOU USED TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC, THAT'S HOW YOU ATTRACTED YOUR FANS SO YOU WOULD BE WISE TO STICK TO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1416523359|5.0|To all of you who have given up somewhere around page 50 - hang in there - it is well worth it! This is my first King novel (Horror is not my thing when it comes to the written word) and I bought it because I walked by it in (*^&%^&^%*&(*&() (a major retail store) and I was waiting for a shippment of books from (*&&^$%$^&^*&( (a major online book seller) and I thought \\"let me give it a try\\". I hated the beginning and the Landon 'slang' (bool, bad-gunky, ....) was annoying to say the least. I kept on reading, like I said I was waiting for a shipment of books...and somewhere around page 100 I turned into the biggest fan of this book!!!!!! It is wicked. I fell asleep and couldn't escape the sickness, I was getting beat up by Dooley and heard the chains rattling and I swear I was trying to open that basement door....GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY. You won't regret it.
0688172377|5.0|Waris Dirie and Cathleen Miller take the reader through an awakening of one young woman - a desire for a safer life, an exciting escape, difficult journey to a new world, the pain of creating and the rewards of a new life, and still the reader is reminded of the necessity to understand that this is a true story of events taking place - right now - injustices - unspoken until this book.  A read for all especially to remind women of the world that,  collectively we can move forward to a safer life.
0743496728|1.0|Ms. Picoult used to be so good, but now her books are so formulaic.  I really didn't like this one either--go back to Songs of the Humpback Whale, please.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|it's only a name anyhow. Just decide whether or not you dig Billy's new territory then proffer or withhold your money. After listening to the full album on a pretty terrific preview site, I promptly chose to save my money and spent a gleeful afternoon in the kitchen preparing food for company while turning out some of my favorite SP moments of yore. We're certainly all entitled to change (after all, every seven years our body has undergone a complete cellular, and perhaps even mental remodeling) so it's perfectly natural for an artist to come to a point within their process where their work is no longer relatable to the majority of their once central audience. So, for Billy and 'crew', the beauty and grandeur you've already birthed into this universe is, and always will be, your greatest comeback.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|5th Gear continues Brad's prominence as master of the Telecaster Guitar, witty and socially timely lyrics, and guy who enjoys what he does for a living.  If you want country music that has comedy, real life emotion, quality musicianship, and is made by someone doing it their way, you won't be disappointed with this offering.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I'll admit, I was skeptical.  I consider all of Porcupine Tree's albums from Signify all the way up through In Absentia to be five star albums.  All of them are nearly flawless, and each of them is groundbreaking in their own way.  They quietly became the best band of the new millenium.  Then came Deadwing.  Deadwing is a solid album, but to me, it is *only* four stars.  While it does have some of their best work, it *gasp* has a few weak tracks at the beginning.  And much worse, it doesn't seem to be a breakthrough album like each of their previous four.    Then came the announcement that the new album would be titled \\"Fear of a Blank Planet.\\"  I thought, \\"This could either work or it will be a complete disaster.\\"  I heard the two tracks that found their way out to the internet before the release, and there was one brilliant track and a better version of \\"Deadwing\\" (the song, that is).  So, to be honest, I was a bit nervous.    After a few months of digesting it, I can now say, with excitement and relief, that this is PT's best work yet.  With the exception of a couple minutes at the end of \\"Anesthetize\\", every single second of this album is solid.  It begins with the heaviest track on the album, musically and perhaps lyrically as well.  They're not messing around here!    After we are treated to a very nice, atmospheric melody in \\"My Ashes\\" (the first PT track in some time to feature strings), we get to experience the brilliance that is most of \\"Anesthetize\\" (clocking in at 17 minutes or so).  This track, albeit epic, is actually fairly minimalistic.  We get repetitive, thinly-layered guitar parts over a trip-hop bass and drum beat which is reminiscent of circa-Up The Downstairs PT.  The drums make this songs work, and they make it work well.  The heavy riffs at some points in the songs are some of the best Steven Wilson has created.    Sentimental has a much lighter feel and flows softly and smoothly.  It also has a sound different than anything they've done before, with high-pitched clean guitars ala U2 (though I'm not a U2 fan in the slightest...).  This is followed by what is perhaps the weakest songs on the album, Way Out Of Here (which is not bad by any means).    The album closes (some would say too soon) with Sleep Together, which is absolutely brilliant.  For all the flak it has gotten in some of these reviews, I consider this one of the most interesting pieces they've put out lately, with a feel that is completely different than anything they've done before.  It ends in epic fashion, with thick strings, keyboards, and guitars reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir, except not as unneccesarily long.    This album is simply phenomenal.  They've outdone themselves.  Steven Wilson has demonstrated with flying colors that he's still got it.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|I am not exactly a die-hard Meat Loaf fan. From his discography, I have just the three recordings from the \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" series, obviously including this one.<br /><br />I can tell that this is a great CD to enjoy. His collection of opera-rock tunes (like \\"The Monster Is Loose\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"In the Land of the Pig, The Butcher is King\\") blended with some soulful and touchy ballads (\\"It's All Coming Back to Me\\", \\"Cry Over Me\\" and \\"Seize the Night\\") sounds very good and decent, a perfect choice for any type of mood, just like any of the previous albums from the \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" trilogy.<br /><br />Comparing this with his previous albums, one can realize that although the music and the production has changed a bit, the style and the intent was to keep the exact formula that made the previous editions to be so successful as they were.
0618871713|5.0|Clearly one of the best memoirs or graphic novels.  It's literate without being too pretentious, but it did make me reach for the dictionary a couple times.  Alison's story and her memories and musings on her father, hometown, college life, and books make each page a pleasure.  Best book I've read in the past year.
1592402038|4.0|That a book on grammar could be this much fun is unbelievable.  Written in a wry British style and pleasantly untouched by American editors, this book twinkles with dry humour, sarcastic remarks and witty double entendres.  Fans of British humour and fans of punctuation will enjoy this book alike.<br /><br />Truss seems to be able to find the humourous side of almost anything and, more often than not, it is her wry way of putting things that results in the laughs. She manages to cover every punctuation mark commonly used in English and a few that arent'.  The coverage is heavy on the apostrophe and comma and somewhat lighter on things like dashes and quotation marks.<br /><br />I do find one philosophical point with which to quibble. Truss initially takes a rather intractable approach to variant usages of punctuation which are creeping into modern writing, blaming them primarily on the internet and a lack of sound grammatical education.  She backs away from this later, stating that the language is indeed fluid and thus change is inevitable.  I am left not quite knowing her position.  Perhaps she is trying to find the middle ground.<br /><br />To summarize, this book will be loved by grammatical sticklers, those who enjoy dry, erudite humour, and perhaps by those who, like myself, are hopeless with punctuation and grammar, but could use a really good, really funny, style guide. (Clearly I have learned nothing about commas in spite reading this book.)
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This version has excellent acting.  I also appreciated the lengthened plot.  Jane Eyre is about a woman of virtue who values her convictions higher than her emotions.  The essence of what makes the story of Jane Eyre so enchanting is purity.  Compromising this point diminishes the power and beauty of the story.    Near the end of the movie, this central point was forsaken in two scenes.  In the first one, after Jane discovers that Mr. Rochester is married, she allows him to kiss her while lying with him on a bed after she knew that he was married.  Furthermore, when Jane and Edward reunite at the end, the premarital displays of affection abandon the innocence that Bronte's character possesses.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|I have been a huge fan since day 1, but I think Billy is moving away from where I am musically. Some good guitar work, but too much mosquito-boy vocalizing. Instead of just rocking out, he's trying to sound profound, and missing. Let the Smashing Pumpkins die.
B000PTYP7U|5.0|Paramore is seriously one of the best bands I have ever listened to.  They are back with their amazing 2nd album witch is sweeping the country and amazing us all. I myself have only known about paramore for a short time and have alreday been transfixed by hayley's voice, Not much talent like that left in the world.  My persional fav songs are misery buisness ( The first single) Miracle, and born for this, all upbest tunes This is a must have album for anyone who loved the first and even if youve only heard a few of these songs YOU WILL NEED THIS ALBUM. Amazing truely amazing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Even though this is not my favorite CD by Coldplay, I found it very enjoyable.
B000002LHX|4.0|For the times this album in my opinion sales were boosted by the success of the film.    \\"Batman\\" soundtrack fully produced and recorded by Prince is by far one of the 90's best soundtracks, however it is a B-list album with B-list songs.    Prince went out of his way to ensure this album had his personal touch to it and he succeeded at it masterfully.    The album is a mix of Funk and R&B. The only track worth really listening to is \\"Scandalous\\" which is a slow ballad that has Prince's signature pure fallsetto.    At anyrate, this album is worth buying for any Prince fan. But, if a friend has it and wants to get get rid of it, just get it for free!  This album is however extremely hard to find on P2P networks, so forget about that avenue of approach!    \\"On the One\\"
1582701709|3.0|I bought this book on CD and listened to it in my car. I found it inspiring and annoying at the same time. Inspiring because some of the speakers really did have good advice to give, and all that positive energy just felt good to be around, but annoying because I thought there was way too much emphasis on 'look at my great big house' and other material stuff. Don't get me wrong, I want more money too, but some of these guys sounded more greedy than anything else. And the stuff about 'fat thoughts' - well, if you're overweight, it's pretty hard to think thin thoughts, or feel thin. And somehow I just don't think that refusing to look at fat people is going to make me any thinner.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book on CD more than the actual printed book (I had hoped that it would contain more detail than the CD, but it did not), and I really do think the principles of attraction work, but Byrne and her crew don't really tell us ordinary folks how to MAKE them work. 'Feel good now'? Easy to say, but hard to do if you just don't happen to feel good.<br /><br />I'd say the CD is definitely worth listening to (have not seen the DVD, but probably worth watching), but I'd recommend, 'Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting' by Lynn Grabhorn over this book. She actually acknowledges that this attraction stuff is hard, describes her own struggles with it, and give you real advice on how to do it. That's 'the secret' that The Secret doesn't tell you.
0930289234|5.0|This book is for the nerds. It's a graphic novel. Which basically means it's a comic book. But in a meta-fictional way. So if you want to read a 250 + page comic book . . . this is the one for you. It's considered the classic of graphic novels. I picked it up because it is by the author who wrote V Is For Vendetta (which was also a graphic novel before it became a movie). And the producers of Sin City and 300 are making a movie out of it. The producers of LOST also said it was one of the most influential books of all time and that they borrowed heavily from it. Without giving away the plot, it's basically the LOST comic book. It's really good. The only reason I gave it an A- instead of something higher is that it ended rather abruptly and was left open-ended. Which I'm finding myself less and less a fan of. If you like LOST you should definitely read it. And if you like comic books . . . I'm sure you've already read it.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This album was completely worth the wait . Amy lee covers all points on the spectrum and her voice is amazing to say the least.from Sweet sacrifice all the way through to good enough, thers not a bad song on this cd in my opinion.
B000002LE6|5.0|Prince begins an era in R&B and popular music. Although Prince's commerical success with the New Power Generation pales in comparison to his success with the Revolution, NPG created music in my opinion the Revolution could not touch.    Prince brought music into rare form. Prince's sound with this album completely changed. Adding more bass, synths, and much more creative funk sounds.    The album is one track at 45 minutes long, I'm guessing because Prince wanted listeners to listen to the entire album straight through. But this album doesnt need that. It is a great album that had a great tour to back it up.    NPG started off a good foot with LoveSexy and Prince hasn't looked back since.
B0000042GM|3.0|I was disappointed by this set and would not recommend it.  It's great that all of Brahms' piano works are included here and the boxed set includes some difficult to find works (like those Op. 21 variation sets) as well as the better known and wonderful later piano pieces and the Op. 39 Waltzes.<br /><br />The problem is that Katchen's performances are flawed and often unpleasant.  The worst problem is that he bangs the keys a lot.  Fortissimo passages are ideally not supposed to be noisy; they are intended to be loud and forceful without being unpleasant.  It's a key distinction that Katchen fails to realize.  I also think that Katchen's technique is a bit patchy.  He blurs the passagework and there is a lack of both accuracy and delicacy in the fast passages.  To take an example, the Op. 76 set is marred by both of these problems: a lack of accuracy and a tendency to bang on the keyboard.  I also found many of the passages that didn't suffer from these problems to be interpretationally uninteresting (the slow parts of the Paganini Variations, Bk II are undistinguished, to take an example).  Big thumbs down.<br /><br />I did some direct comparison of sets to the Katchen performances and in every case Katchen was far inferior.<br /><br />Take the Op. 39 Waltzes: Leon Fleisher's old recording is wonderful and much more sensitive and interesting than Katchen.<br /><br />I also listened to Radu Lupu's recording of the Opp. 117-119 pieces (THAT is a wonderful recording - if you are looking for a superb recording of Brahms piano music, get that one and save yourself the aggravation of the Katchen set) and it's simply no contest.<br /><br />I also sampled the terrific Op. 79 Rhapsodies and the Paganini Variations as played by a favorite pianist of mine, the lesser-known French pianist Nicholas Angelich, and Katchen's sloppy and undirected interpretations pales before the versions by a \\"non-superstar\\" pianist.<br /><br />So while I admit I haven't listened to every portion of the Katchen set, I found every reason to avoid it when compared to some alternatives available.of the Katchen set, I found every reason to avoid it when compared to some alternatives available.
B00000IL29|5.0|Great jazz album from the '60s. This one belongs high up in the pantheon of jazz albums that include Miles Davis's [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]], John Coltrane's [[ASIN:B000005H7D Blue Train]], and [[ASIN:B00000I8UH Speak No Evil]] by Wayne Shorter. If you feel that these other albums are essiential jazz listening, then you will certainly enjoy 'Maiden Voyage' by Herbie Hancock, and you will see why people still rave about this album today.   If you are an experienced jazz fan then you will most definately already have an opinion on this album, but if you are just getting into jazz then this album should certainly be on your 'to buy' list. Firm five stars from me!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|OK, First i would like to say that from what I have heard I like the album. yes Billy's voice does sound different in ways and from what I have heard of the album it doesn't seem to fit in some of the songs. That being said I have yet to get the album so my 4 stars is going on what I have heard so far but that could change once I get the album and hear it all the way through....I have responses to eerievonevil's review...here are some of the things you said....    I'd say the better buy of today is Bad Religion's new album, \\"New Maps Of Hell\\", which is less \\"See the light\\" and more of what the world really needs: \\"TRUTH\\".   --TRUTH? How do you define truth??? I'm just wondering if you subscribe to the worldview that all truth is relative and that what is true for you may not be true for me. If you do believe that all truth is relative (which in itself is an absolute truth statement, coincidentally contardicting the foundation of relativism) then you have no right to say that Bad religion's albums preach are any more \\"true\\" than what Billy thinks....    then you said this: I am perfectly ok with a human being believing what they want to believe, but it REALLY hurts the music when you make the music reflect your personal views only.   --Don't you think Bad religion's albums reflect only their personal views and how they disagree with other views, especially religious ones??? I don't think that him expressing his views is what bothers you. It seems that it bothers you only because you don't hold the same views, which is totally cool. If Billy held the same views as you and was writing about them I don't think you would have a problem. Artists write about their views and opinions, every single one of them. So your argument doesn't make much sense to me. Also why would Billy write about things he doesn't believe in at all??? That would seem pretty ingenuine    Anyway, this wasn't a personal attack and I hope it didn't seem that way. I was just curious as to why you saidthose things cuz your support didnt seem to back up any of your arguments. I would love to talk more about this if you feel up to it. take care
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I own all three of her CDs. Come Away with Me is the best IMO. Her passion and talent shine through. Each song was worthy to be on the CD.  In Feels Like Home, it seemed she relaxed a bit, had a little more fun, but lost some of the passion, a couple of the songs were not up to what I expected, but passed as entertaining.  This third CD is the worst. My impression was that now that she has made a name for herself she can put any track on a CD without much scrutiny. I have listened to it a few times, but it just doesn't do anything exciting for me.  A big disappointment.
B000G759LW|4.0|Great CD.  Love most of the songs.  Some are OK, and real different.
B000004712|5.0|This album is a modern jazz masterpiece, and no lover of jazz should be without this purchase. Yes these are covers of contempory pop and rock hits, but they do not sound like cheap covers. Hancock has reworked them into intricate masterful pieces, and this album is up there with his early brilliance of [[ASIN:B00000IL29 Maiden Voyage]] in my opinion.    Since I picked this up last year it has has so much rotation in my disc player, and this along with Miles Davis's [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]] is perfect jazz for almost any occasion. Like that lofty album, Hancock's 'New Standard' makes great background music for any dinner or cafe setting, and for more astute listening the album holds many moments of interest and enjoyment.    Although I don't mind his funk and experimental chill material, I believe that this is the kind of material that Herbie Hanckock truely shines, and it is what places him above many other artists today. This album is a great return to form, and I heartily recommend it to both casual listeners of jazz and the more serious jazz academics.    I would love to see more of the same quality from Herbie Hancock in the years to come. Five stars from me!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this album due to all the bad press surrounding the release, but I was very pleased when I listened to it. It probably won't appeal to the younger fans of Idol and the 'Breakaway' album because the lyrics are definately more mature, but don't write it off until you listen to it.    Kelly's voice shines on this album as well; there's a lot of emotion coming through her voice, which I assume is because she actually wrote these songs.     Some of the best tracks on the album are How I Feel, Chivas, Can I Have a Kiss, Be Still and Sober.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Probably the most unique art rock mainstream band of the 90's, The Smashing Pumpkin are reborn and rock harder(or as hard) than they have before with Zeitgeist! It's a shame D'arcy and James Iha did not reunite, but after having listened to Zeitgeist several times through the last couple of days, the results couldn't be more satisfying with or without the two missing members. Ok, ok, that was a lie.. I miss them!<br /><br />Anyways, I always admired how the early Smashing Pumpkins crossed through creative bounderies/grunge norms during their time, mixing artistic experimental elements to their core rock sound while earning mtv mainstream success with their unique style(image and music); which is why I am glad to see the new SP on Zeitgeist still a step away from current trend of \\"emo\\" or \\"indie\\" music by making a very straight forward yet sonically diverse rock n' roll album with Corgan's signature poetic lyrics with some songs (unsurprisingly after a glance at the cover art) seem to be about the strifes we are currently facing in our modern society while still being somewhat broad to interpretation. This is probably the Pumpkins most solid rock record since \\"Gish\\".<br /><br />The songs of Zeitgeist? \\"Doomsday Clock\\" is a powerful opening track, and rocks as much as the opening track \\"Everlasting Gaze\\" from Machina I did; but unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist rocks on with angsty \\"7 Shades Of Black\\". \\"Bleeding the Orchid\\" is probably my favorite track on the record, beginning with beautiful echoes from Corgans voice. The song is very \\"Adorish\\", but with fantastic Camberlin drumming! A dream come true. \\"Thats The Way(My Love Is)\\" Is a cheerful sounding rock tune some what reminecent of \\"Siamese Dream\\" with some experimental elements, and ends beautifully... The mood is ruined(in a good way!) as \\"Tarantula\\", the first album single, rocks your brains out with its anthemic chorus and Corgans squealing guitar. \\"Starz\\" is a very stop-and-start song with loud and quiet parts. I think Jimmy shows off alot in this track :). \\"United States\\", probably my 2nd fav. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colosal 9:51 Smashing Pumpkins grande song masterpiece much like \\"Silverf*ck\\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentations).. The song is angry! \\"Neverlost\\" to me is kind of sappy softy with a bubbly noise(zilaphone?) in the background. \\"Bring The Light\\" brings the rock back and follows in the same vein as \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\", which is a good thing. \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\" demands your attention like \\"Tarantula\\" did and rocks just as hard. \\"For God & Country\\" sounds alot like an early Cure song, with a steady drum beat and keyboard. The songs lyrics (to me) are very inspirational and have a hopeful message in them. ahhhh... the final song \\"Pomp And Circumstance\\" is the most old SP sounding song on the record and continues the SP's reputation of ending records with painfully beautiful grand finally song.<br /><br />Hopefully, Zeitgeist will be only the first of many records to come from The Smashing Pumpkins, because like alot of people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the groups 2007 reformation was a dream almost come true. Maybe in the near future D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, whatever... As Apparent in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Camberlin seem to have no problem continuing the SP legacy. Highly Reccomended.ws off alot in this track :). \\"United States\\", probably my 2nd fav. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colosal 9:51 Smashing Pumpkins grande song masterpiece much like \\"Silverf*ck\\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentations)..

B000002ADT|5.0|Well this is THE album to have in your music collection. Its been said many times, but if you only have one jazz album then this is the one to get. This is perhaps the most referred to document of jazz in the history of music, and it does live up to expectations.    Miles Davis was a genius, and both he and his collection of musicians were at the top of their game when they recorded this body of modal work.Timeless in appeal, perfect for background and just as interesting for the astute late night listener. 'Moody' doesn't do the album justice, and neither does any review. If you like jazz, then you simply MUST HAVE this album. If you don't like jazz then grab this out of interest, and watch how it subliminally grows on you.    I cannot recommend this album enough, it deserves more stars than I can give it. I am in reverence of this album, and it is one of the albums that I cannot do without. It will be hard pressed for you to find a bad review regarding this album, and I think that says it all.     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Many of the thoughts have been passionately expressed, but I wanted to add that having Nick Rasckulinez (Foo Fighters, Frank Black and the Catholics, The Reunion Show) was a great change for these guys.  Raw, yet sharp.  Keeping things fresh while maintaining the 'core' RUSH characteristics we all love.

B00005Q4CS|1.0|(1) Drugs are bad, m'kay.<br /><br />(2) Anyone can be addicted to anything, therefore anything is a drug, and that addiction to whatever can ruin your life.<br /><br />These are the two main themes in Aronofsky's vastly overrated masterpiece for the MTV generation.  The film reeks of it's generation's thorough shallowness; flashy jump cuts, those obnoxious noises (yeah, it's supposed to be unsettling,but it's not, it's just boring and obnoxious.), overly intense cinematography.  It's gritty if your idea of a confrontational film is Bowling for Columbine.<br /><br />It's certainly one of the most heavy handed films in recent memory, not to mention completely and totally biased.  There's only one side of the coin here, folks, or maybe the coin only has one side?  Nah, that's just ignorant.  There are plenty of people who engage in \\"health risking\\" addictions who don't end up with their arm amputated or resorting to prostitution for rich guys.<br /><br />It's tagged drama, but I think it's quite possibly the epitome of melodrama, as everything is so overblown it's laughable.<br /><br />Like Fight Club, another film popular with the youngsters who would kill themselves if they had to sit down for a film far more unsettling, not to mention vastly more realistic, and that's John Cassavete's Faces, it's all about shock, trying to scare the bejeezus out of you with, again, overblown scenarios.<br /><br />Well, Selby was a hack writer, so a hack film for a hack writer I suppose.
1931559317|5.0|Pocket Sky Atlas is the one. Amateur astronomers have been waiting for it and it is here. Our input was listened to thoroughly this time for probably the first time and the result is a complete success. This is what made all the difference, incorporating what has been asked for repeatedly for years. A very sturdy little manual, brilliantly arranged and convenient to use; you're almost never \\"lost\\". It includes all the best DSO's for small or large telescopes, with enough stars to make it useful. It includes most important lists such as the complete Herschel 400, even thought the magnitudes for some objects are beyond the atlas limit. Even the font is the correct one to be most legible in the dark under red light with tired eyes, numbers as well as letters. (\\"Is that a 6 or an 8?\\") This atlas, a copy of Nightwatch, and a good planisphere such as David Chandler's, and you have all you need for observational astronomy. I'm sorry to call all other authors' works superfluous.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|First, if all you've heard of rock up to this point is stuff like the White Stripes, Coldplay, Radiohead and other contemporary bands than this album will probably sound fresh and cool and it would be pointless to read my review.  But, if you expect a little bit more from your rock and roll than the same old sh#@ this review is a buyer beware....<br /><br />Tiresome is a word I never thought I would put to a White Stripes album, but I find it the most natural word to express my impression of Icky Thump.  I was surprised how many rock cliches I heard on his side project with The Raconteurs and thought perhaps because it was a band effort that once he got back into the saddle with as The White Stripes all that bombastic artiness would return, but no!<br /><br />Icky Thump has really poor melodies and the lyrics are some of the worst this side of Paul McCartney ala Wing's Wildlife.<br /><br />The best moments of the album which there are very few come in songs like A Martyr For My Love For You and the catchy Icky Thump.  But overall this is just a big disappointment from a man that is capable of much more.<br /><br />Get Behind Me Satan was a pretty good album but it marked a departure from the other White Stripes albums because it sounded like Jack White was expanding his sound, after the awful Raconteurs album and this Icky Thump it sounds more like it was an failed attempt to escape his own success.
1857988094|3.0|I can see why certain elements of the sci-fi community love this novel, but it is overrated. It was worth the hour it took me to read it, but one of the best sci-fi works of all time?? Hardly.<br /><br />  The story starts out great. Matheson does an excellent job of portraying Neville's total isolation and lonliness. The internal dialogue of Neville as he goes about his daily routine is superb. The flashbacks, especially where Neville's wife returns to life, are as chilling as anything you will read in a Stephen King work.<br /><br />  The story goes south after Neville encounters the band of plague-resistant humans. Suffice it to say, it is patently absurd that a man who took such great pains to maintain his life and sanity for so long, would so abruptly commit the ultimate act of cowardice. Not only is it against human nature, it defies Neville's characterization up to that point.<br /><br />  Matheson very cleverly uses the character of Neville, who is not a believer, to advance the view that religion is nothing more than a subset of culture. Obviously, this sort of \\"soft-atheism\\" is a common theme in sci-fi: attack religion indirectly through ridicule, or create a future world where religion has disappeared and is irrelevant. (Funny, that future is always arriving but never seems to get here!) The idea that vampirism is real, but not supernatural, is not new. As an argument against belief in God, it is rather weak. Nevertheless, the concept of  mass hysteria caused by a combination of ancient supersticion and yellow journalism is intriguing. I think the character of Neville could have explored it with more credibility had Matheson written him as a believer.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|If you like John Mayer, you'll love this album.  \\"Dreaming with a Broken Heart\\" is totally relatable if you've ever been though a relationship that's ended.  The rest of the album is fantastic....an album you can listen to over and over, and still want to listen again.
B00025482Y|3.0|Camel-heads seem less divided about this album now than when it came out in the mid-80s.  At that time it was perceived as too pop and not prog enough, but it has aged well, both as a musical statement and in how fans recall it.  Certainly it was a stronger effort than its very commercial predecessor The Single Factor, and strikes me now as a sort of sequel to the earlier Nude, in its balance of prog and pop elements and its underlying concept.  Ably assisted by an entirely new band, including Chris Rainbow on vocals, Ton Scherpenzeel (Kayak), and Paul Burgess and Davy Paton (Pilot, Alan Parsons Project), with only Mel Collins guesting from any earlier line-up, main man Andy Latimer told a loose story of Cold War Peril in divided Berlin, balancing Gilmour-esque instrumental passages like Missing or the title track with well-crafted songs such as Cloak & Dagger Man, the catchy Fingertips, and the gorgeous Long Goodbyes -- which sounds rather like Anthony Phillips, so I wonder if it have been mooted for The Single Factor originally.  That said, it's not the album for Camel novices (Snow Goose or Moonmadness should have that honor, I think) but is an underrated and satisfying achievement whose stock has risen since its first issue.<br /><br />Let me just add a few details on the new version compared to my original Metronome CD.  Latimer has acquired the rights and re-released Stationary Traveler in slightly improved form, restoring it to how he had intended it before the record company got involved.  The packaging's virtually identical, except with a couple more booklet images similar to the familiar cover art - I'd guess they were on the LP inner sleeve.  The page coloring's now yellow instead of white, and the cover lettering is now uniformly white (no more red Camel).  No additional credits or liner notes.  The CD label borrows the style of the Decca releases, with the band name and title in Gothic lettering.<br /><br />Music: two new tracks appear, though I understand they exist already as live versions in the concert recordings from that era.  The album now opens with In The Arms of Waltzing Frauleins, which isn't prog at all but lyrically tied to, and musically clearly derivative of (deliberately so), the world that the story evokes.  Thus it sets the mood quite well, being a melancholy folksong, replete with accordion, that one might hear while drinking in a cabaret in Weimar Berlin.  It anticipates in certain ways the brief instrumental After Words, I think.  The real plus is the extended Pressure Points, which now closes the record.  Calling it an extended mix clouds the issue; it should really be labeled 'complete version,' of which the old version that used to open the album is just the first movement.  Where it originally ended, it now moves on a rumbling synth bed into a guitar mid-section that recalls elements of Nude before returning to the opening theme.  It's better, certainly, as is the record overall in its new, fuller edition.and they exist already as live versions in the concert recordings from that era.

B000J103YI|4.0|Great music from the movie.  My only complaint is it's literally pulled from the movie, so it's a little weird to listen to it while not watching the movie, the singing dialog from the movie.  Jennifer Hudson is the highlight throughout the album.
B000069AUI|5.0|This review has been long overdue. But with 'Politik' playing in the background now, I have been kind of driven to write this. This album is  Coldplay's best work so far and definitely in a different league compared to most other music in the same genre (rock). Even with the kind of following Coldplay has, I think they are quite underrated. For example, this album itself is ranked 473th on Rolling Stone's list of greatest albums. Are you kidding me?! I find that hard to believe. It's true that this music is not for all moods or for everyone. But it's musical creation at its finest with amazing melodies and brilliant lyrics. The songs are beautiful, melancholic, moody, introspective and profound. The beauty of Coldplay is that even the saddest song will end with a ray of hope (this is very unlike Radiohead with whom they are compared so often). All the tracks are exceptional, there isn't a filler in the whole album. But if I have to choose, my favorites tracks will be 'Politik', 'A Rush of Blood to the Head', 'The Scientist', 'Clocks', 'Green Eyes' and 'In My Place'. I mentioned about the lyrics earlier. I will just say that these are some of the most wonderful lyrics I have ever heard. Poetic and sublime, the lyrics will keep haunting you. Chris Martin is an exceptionally talented song writer, perhaps the best of today's breed.    This is definitely a must-buy album. Twenty years from now, it will be considered as a landmark in the history of music.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Mary Harron's film is a depiction of the Bret Easton Ellis (Rules of Attraction, Less Than Zero) controversial novel of the same name.  It's only significant difference is that it leaves out some of the more gruesome scenarios in Ellis's book.  I'm not sure whether that's a drawback or not but there was some rage missing in our killer's actions.  The film operates as a first person narrative and contains the same kind of oddball combinations of extreme violence and dark humor.  This kind of humor is exactly my kind of humor, so I laughed at American Psycho throughout.  Mary Harron also seemed to recognize that the novel was old enough that she should approach the film as a period piece and she executes this well.  Everything about this movie feels like the late 1980s.  She creates a virtual remake of the novel as I pictured it in my head years ago.  From what I understand Harron also fought hard to keep the role of Patrick Bateman (the title character and the story's protagonist) in the capable hands of Christian Bale.  Bale is outstanding here and Harron really seems to be a directorial force with her actors.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman is a 27 year-old wealthy and successful investor.  He is clearly a product of a privileged and ultra-competitive background.  We follow him around and listen to all of his observations of the world he lives in.  This is of course the yuppie culture of the 1980s. Perhaps Bateman is the extreme yuppie and a harbinger to the ills of this socially produced subgroup and the culture they exist in.  As it turns out his world features the substantiality that he is indeed a murderer.  Unfortunately no one seems to notice this, despite his blatant and at times hilariously dry claims that he is a psycho.  Evidence of his murders also seemed to disappear quite easily.  American Psycho, like the novel, is a great satire that might leave viewers with some frustrating questions in the end.  What was real and what was imaginary?<br /><br />The rest of the cast includes Wilem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloë Sevigny, and Reese Witherspoon.  All are fairly effective within their roles but the film weighed heavily on Bale's performance.  He understands Patrick Bateman and makes the character the mind-blowingly shallow and overly competitive monster he is.<br /><br />The thing that surprises most is that a great female director like Harron decided to take on a story so pervasively accused of misogyny.  Harron's other films are about a radical feminist (Valerie Salanas in I Shot Andy Warhol) and an icon of women's liberation (Bettie Page in The Notorious Bettie Page).  I almost think she intentionally went against the grain here to break out of the mold Hollywood can often create for women and minority directors.  Good for her.  Her movies are interesting and American Psycho is a stand-out.includes Wilem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloë Sevigny, and Reese Witherspoon.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|When I first heard the tracks from this album about a month ago, I was immediately turned off by them all. But that was because I was expecting to hear the usual nu-metal sound with the rock/rap flow. When I listen to this album more and more, however, I realize that it is the same Linkin Park, and it is the same type of lyrics. The meat of this album is what really turned my attitude towards this \\"new sound\\" from closed-minded to open-minded. I think it's interesting to see Linkin Park take their sound into a different direction, but what you have to understand is that music comes in two parts: the beat and the lyrics. The beat may have changed, but I think the power of the lyrics will resonate throughout you if you just have the open-mindedness and patience that the band probably intended for their audience to have.     I've been a Linkin Park fan since I was in middle school. I'm a senior in college now, and there's something about the way these guys make their music that just fits me like a coat. Linkin Park is such an awesome band, and if you are a fan like I am, you should at least give this album your full attention and see how the lyrics and sound blend together. Don't just HEAR the sound, but LISTEN to it. I think the ones who are criticizing this album are the ones who think that Linkin Park should have a particular SOUND, and so they equate \\"greatness\\" with anything that resembles that sound. But that is a fallacy. Greatness for Linkin Park, for me, is how they are able to get their message across through various types of sounds. Nu-metal was great for them, and I think this new style will be great for them, too.    I personally think this album is one of their more mature albums. Meteora is my all-time favorite, but Minutes to Midnight is slowly moving upward towards Meteora status. 'What I've Done' is such a powerful song to me, as are 'Bleed it Out' and, especially, 'Leave Out All the Rest.'
0743298020|4.0|The real life of the famous writer Vida Winter has always been a mystery. The journalists, who asked about her personal life, heard nineteen different stories... Then at last, Vida decides to tell the truth. Why now? Why did she choose as a confidant absolutely unknown daughter of the book store owner, the girl who is more at home in 19th century novels, than in our world?    Since \\"The Thirteenth tale\\" is a mystery book, I would not reveal more of a plot. I enjoyed the book, mainly because of its atmosphere - it's so absolutely 19th century, somewhere between sisters Bronte and \\"Woman in White\\". The fans of gothic novels would find all the necessary attributes - old mansions, ghosts, family mysteries... even asylum (Who uses this word nowadays, anyway?)... and all this is happening today (or not? Author switches between novels and centuries with the same grace and ease).    I would not give five stars to the book for a couple of reasons.  First, the beginning was very slow. This would be a necessary attribute of any 19th century novel, but I seriously thought about dropping the book before finishing first thirty pages.   Second, all the parallels with Bronte sisters (especially \\"Jane Eure\\") somewhere in the second half of the book became too obvious, so some of the plot twists - that were supposed to be shocking news - somehow weren't that surprising to me. On the other hand, this technique allowed to the author to skip characterization of some of the characters - it's so much easier to use literary associations and let the readers do the work themselves!   Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable read, and I would wait for the second book by Diane Setterfield.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I've been waiting for the this album to come out for years now. In the interim I've been listening to live versions of the their new material on YouTube and attended a couple Smashing Pumpkins concerts. So now that I finally have Zeitgeist firmly planted in my iPod (with a cumulative \\"play count\\" of well over 200), I have a pretty good idea of what I think of this album.    I have swung back and forth between \\"this album is great!\\" to \\"what happened to Billy Corgan's genius?\\" a thousand times over. In the end I had to give myself a good hard slap - what was I thinking? This album is great. It rocks and it rocks hard. I don't think The Smashing Pumpkins have ever been this strong, musically. The drum and guitar work alone make this CD worth having. Both Billy and Jimmy have taken mastery of their respective instruments to the next level.    The reason I originally listened to Zeitgeist undecided of this its quality is because lyrically it's no where near as strong as previous Smashing Pumpkins albums. There simply aren't any lines that grab you, shake you up, and change your perception of reality. The reason for this is simple; Billy Corgan is a much happier person. He no longer has burning questions about life, reality, ageing and death. His questions are now mostly directed and finding lasting love, and the future of a global culture that just can't maintain its current style of living - both of which make for far less interesting, mysterious lyrics.    Now I'm going to take a second to debunk the primary issues reviewers have had with this album:    \\"This isn't the real Smashing Pumpkins because it only consists of 2 of the original members\\"  So what? In my opinion the idea of a 2 person band makes much more sense than a group. 2 good friends will get a lot more done than 4 people who can't stand being around each other.    \\"All the songs sound the same\\"  Even if the songs were all the same, and I'm not saying they are, have you ever listened to a Jack Johnson CD?He seems to be doing just fine.    \\"Billy Corgan is just seeking attention\\"  Again, so what? I've noticed that most negative reviews I've read for Zeitgeist start with an attack on Billy Corgan's character. If you don't like the guy, fine, but what relevance does that have on the quality of a his band's CD?    In the end, I'd give Zeitgeist 2 stars if I were comparing it to other Smashing Pumpkins CDs. I really miss the intense emotion and mind bending lyrics. I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm comparing it to the current music landscape, which is in desperate need of an album like this.
6304698798|5.0|I THINK THAT THIS MOVIE IS A TRUE ART FORM AND DEFINITELY ONE OF CLINT EASTWWOOD'S BEST OF ALL TIME.  ALSO THE PARTS OF ELI WALLACH AND LEE VAN CLEEF SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED, THE BOTH WERE SUPERB!  THE WHOLE PRODUCTION KEEPS YOUR UNDEVIDED ATTENTION AND LEAVES YOU WITH THE FEELING OF JUST VIEWING A \\"TRUE CLASSIC!!\\"  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE WITHOUT HESITATION!!  THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY IS A GREAT BUY!!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|The Smashing Pumpkins are going to be just fine without D'Arcy and James Iha.  How so?  Listen to \\"Zeitgeist.\\"  Sounds like the Smashing Pumpkins to me.  Of course, looking at back catalogue writing credits would have confirmed how little they contributed.  And if memory serves me right, when Corgan announced the Pumpkins were coming back, I believe the word he used was \\"revival.\\"  It's a far cry from \\"reunion.\\" But I'm not writing this to rip Iha and D'Arcy apart (I love the Pumpkins, miss them, but this will do just fine).    \\"Zeitgeist\\" returns Corgan to his hard rock roots.  Loud, distorted guitars, thunderous drums (Chamberlain has never sounded better), and blistering guitar solos are all over this record.  The album kicks off with \\"Doomsday Clock,\\" which sounds like a much better Black Sabbath tribute than \\"Heavy Metal Machine\\" ever was.  It sets the tone for the rest of the album rather well, dealing with an apocalyptic theme.  Billy knows how to write catchy songs, and \\"Doomsday Clock\\" certainly is one of them.  It's followed by \\"7 Shades of Black,\\" another great rocker.  If you were to take \\"Jellybelly,\\" \\"Where Boys Fear To Tread,\\" and \\"Bodies,\\" you might get something like this song.  \\"Bleeding the Orchid\\" is slower, but still loud.  I caught myself singing along on the first listen.  \\"That's the Way\\" is one of the more positive songs on the album.  There's something that's both very \\"Machina\\" and \\"Gish\\" about it.  Then you have the mighty \\"Tarantula,\\" the first single from \\"Zeitgeist.\\"  Corgan and Chamberlain show off some really great playing here, some of their best since \\"Geek USA.\\"  It's the perfect song for a lead single.  It sends a message:  The Pumpkins are back.  Not only are they back, but they're writing songs with the same intensity they had on \\"Siamese Dream\\" and \\"Mellon Collie.\\"    \\"Starz\\" is a song that gets better with repeat listens.  It might sound annoying at first, but it has its moments.  The breakdown brings to mind a Rush-style drum solo, only not as long.  Track 7 is \\"United States.\\"  Clocking in just short of 10 minutes, this is the closest to self indulgent the album gets (and even this isn't that bad).   The song captures an aggressive, ranting side of Corgan that usually only comes out in concert.  Its no \\"Silverf*ck,\\" but it's still very good.  \\"Neverlost\\" is the first time the album really slows down.  It's mellow, but not like the Pumpkins used to be (more on the subject later).  It sounds more like it would have fit in on Corgan's solo record.  Not necessarily bad, but not great either.  \\"Bring the Light\\" is another song that detracts from the gloom and doom.  Lyrically, it's close to Zwan.  It's spiritual, but not overly so.  And it rocks enough for those who would be put off to not even care. \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\" is a fun song.  Cool guitar riff (like an upbeat version of \\"Dross\\"), and another example of Corgan's ability to write catchy songs.  \\"God and Country\\" isn't as nearly as political as it sounds.  Nor is it all that interesting.  It's another synth laden song that could have been on \\"TheFutureEmbrace.\\"  The album closes with \\"Pomp and Circumstances,\\" another mellow song, and possibly the best one.  Corgan leaves you with one last blazing guitar solo, faintly reminiscent of Queen.    If the Pumpkins are missing anything, it's balance.  They used to know what they were doing when it came to both quiet and loud songs.  There isn't a bad heavy song on \\"Zeitgeist.\\"  The quiet songs are few, and are some of the weakest in their catalogue.  Where are the great acoustic songs?  The synthesizer songs all sound alike, and don't work as well as \\"Disarm,\\" \\"Thirty-Three,\\" or even \\"Obscured.\\"  Strong song writing on both the electric guitar and acoustic was such a strong point for the Pumpkins, and it's sorely missed on \\"Zeitgeist.\\"    Still, out of 12 songs (13 if you get one of the bonus tracks), the two flawed songs are easy to look past.  These are 10 of the strongest songs Corgan has recorded in a decade.  In spite of doing so much wrong (making it a re-launch instead of a reunion, residency shows instead of a tour, enough versions of the album to drive a collector insane), Corgan and company have proved they can record a comeback album worth listening to.  Let's hope they can keep it together.  It sure is good to have them back.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Want to know about Bela Lugosi his life and his co-stars in the movie \\"Dracula!\\"  I learned many things about each category that I did not know before!  Very detailed account of Bela and how he became \\"Count Dracula\\" that I am sure a true fan would find most interesting.  Best of all, the classic movie \\"Dracula\\" plays on Disc 1.  The true fan can really appreciate how the movie has been re-mastered.  This movie is worth buying and not a disappointment.
0060763892|5.0|This was a great book, to go along with a great series. I cannot wait for the next book to be released. The characters are getting more in depth which I really like. Thanks James Rollins for not disappointing.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I love this CD. I think too much has been made about the record label and Kelly not seeing eye to eye.  It likely happens with every artist (as well as with any adult that has every held a REAL job or a family) just depends on how the media spins, they decided to make Kelly the enemy.  She is a successful artist, vocalist, who chooses to share her anger and bitterness with the world. Her songs are well written and adequately illustrate her aforementioned anger and hostility.  We've all been there, significant other, who you trusted, fails and/or leaves you, your job sucks, and everyone has a comment about you and your life.  You are left justifiably irate, disturbed, jaded and cynical.  This is a great CD for those moments. Plus, Kelly has an incredible voice. My favorites, in order, are 'Haunted', 'Sober', 'Never Again', 'Maybe', and 'Hole'.
0141023384|5.0|This is a story discussing many themes and topics we learn about in school, however Achebe's construction of the novel is so uniquely powerful, enthralling, and mind-blowing.  I never truly felt the severity and the impact of colonialism nor did I ever feel that I might have common irrefutably human connections with a fictional character from a culture with which I am totally unfamiliar who is so unlike me in every way.  You will feel a great wave of emotion upon reading the last line of this book.  The best ending of a book ever.  Marvelously crafted!
0385338694|1.0|Like some reviewers, I also read Can You Keep a Secret and enjoyed it. So I picked this up and was terribly disappointed. The story is just ridiculous! I know it's fiction, but good writers have the talent to make the reader BELIEVE the fiction they write...this book wasn't believable in any aspect. This high-powered, genius-IQ lawyer has NEVER ironed a shirt, or cooked a meal? And then she throws away her years of school and her job to be a housekeeper? Come ON! Why she wouldn't just tell this family she works for that it was all a misunderstanding from the very beginning just doesn't hold water.   Another thing that bugged me was that it was written like a romantic comedy screenplay! The scene where Nathanial gets off the train and they're on opposite sides of the tracks...it was so clearly written like one of those sterotypical chick flick movies. So predictable and lame. Ick.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Okay, I am going to review one song, and not the entire album (yeah, yeah. Go ahead with the negative votes). But please read on.<br /><br />For the past two days I've been listening to one song, Snow, over and over. The cool thing is with iTunes repeat, it's the kind of song that just undulates into highs and lows, mellow and rapping and metal and back to mellow; like it never ends (and by the way, I DON'T do drugs anymore. Just want to clarify).<br /><br />This is what the Chili Peppers represent to me. They have that definite sound that's been imitated ad-infinitum. But they started that sound (at least for white people) and added the heavy guitars to rapping found only in Run DMC's second hit, Rock Box back in the early 80s. Punk? Yeah. Well, that's just part of their story. Much more multicultural than that.<br /><br />But what I want to say is, you know how there's that song that represents a certain time in your life? I call them life soundtrack songs. They're powerful and give you goose bumps, and you remember that time when you were, say, just walking down the street, and this beautiful serene rhythm took over from hearing that one song. Two years from now I'll try to recapiture this song's impact, but it will be second hand by then.<br /><br />So, thank you Chili Peppers, for coming up with what I see as tPart II of that beautiful/desperate epic of pain and resurrection; Under the Bridge. That's when I knew you guys were incredible, and that you'd been there.<br /><br />You know.<br /><br />And that it made you better in the long run.
6305313687|5.0|Tony Kaye's hard-hitting, frighteningly credible look at racism and aggrieved adolescence smoothes over nothing in its depiction of angry working-class California youth who find pride and camaraderie under the aegis of a White Power demagogue (Stacy Keach). But \\"X\\" owes its extraordinary power to the super-charged, Oscar-nominated performance by Norton, beefed up and seething with monstrous hatred in the film's many flashbacks. With Norton so convincing in balancing Derek's obvious intelligence and charisma with his more noxious Nazi persona, \\"American History X\\" is a raw, engrossing tale of a pained conscience turned inside out.
0385338082|5.0|This book was hilariouis!! I was literally laughing out loud!  I CANNOT wait to  start the shopaholic series.  I haven't read a good, funny, book like this in a while. I recommended this book to a couple of freinds and they liked it as well.  I finihsed it within a few days, easy to read as well
B00003CWN3|5.0|This gritty, compelling film by debut director Kimberly Peirce examines homophobia, sexual identity, and unconventional love in a small, dead-end town. Based on the real-life story of Brandon Teena (born Teena Brandon) who was murdered in 1993, \\"Boys\\" is a first-rate docudrama with a lot on its mind, but Peirce never lets the issues diminish the emotional impact of her story. Swank's unusually brave performance, honored with an Oscar, is gut-wrenching to watch, while arthouse darling Sevigny breaks your heart as Brandon's love interest. Brutal subject matter, but \\"Boys\\" demands to be seen.
0743496728|5.0|This book is definitlely one of my favorites by Jodi Picoult.  I loved the whole storyline about the school shotting.  It's definitley a page turner, always new surprises and twists. I would also recommend Salem Falls  ( was my favorite until 19 minutes came out)
B00002E224|5.0|This intelligent and unconventional tale of talky romance borrows something from the work of French auteur Eric Rohmer, but \\"Slacker\\" director Linklater--a master of meandering conversation--puts his own stamp on the character-driven drama with searching, tone-perfect dialogue. As they wander the streets discussing love and sex, history and politics, Hawke and Delpy make attractive kindred spirits whose youthful, sometimes argumentative exchanges really seem to echo real life. Despite the R rating, \\"Sunrise\\" is an ideal film for teens, as it captures a sense of life's wondrous possibilities.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|The more I watch this movie the more I appreciate it's depth. If you love a good drama and even a bit of a tissue grabbing movie, then this one will please you.
0800177177|5.0|A rare instance when a remake brings with it something new, Coppola's \\"Dracula\\" recounts Bram Stoker's oft-filmed tale with a graphic intensity the honored 1931 original can't match. Oldman is a marvel in the title role, changing forms with startling rapidity, and his pursuit of Mina and her close friend Lucy (Sadie Frost) contains a blatantly sexual charge, helping earn its \\"R\\" rating. Anthony Hopkins is also well-cast as Van Helsing, and look for singer Tom Waits as the fly-eating Renfield. Kudos to Coppola for such a bold, colorful, and kinetic re-invention of this immortal story.
B000000WFF|5.0|this is even better than their 1st album! spice up your life is my fave spice girls song! this album is better than 1st b/c it just is; just listn to spice up your life, too much (rarely does a slow song sound so good!), and saturday night divas. plz get this album, you'll love it!
B00007AJF8|5.0|This strangely inventive surrealistic comedy was the inaugural collaboration between onetime music-video director Jonze and talented screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. With such a bizarre concept, this film could have sent audiences home scratching their own noggins, but Cusack, Keener, and an unrecognizable Diaz have a bright, wonderful chemistry that shines through all the head-trippiness. And who can deny that Malkovich, normally such a priggish presence, doesn't have a devilish sense of humor, especially in a hilarious scene where he enters his own head and freaks out? Clever, inspired, and extremely funny, \\"Malkovich\\" is cinema-as-funhouse-mirror, and the effect is dizzying.
B00005OM4N|2.0|love brit. but didn't really like this album. i did like i'm a slave for you; i like anything produced by the neptunes. advice to brit: if you really want to make a big comeback, simply go in the studio with the hottest producers: NEPTUNES, Timbaland, and Sean Garrett.
B000AARKW6|5.0|Set in the swinging disco era, De Palma's moody, absorbing study of an ex-con trying to stay on the straight and narrow offers just the right mix of noirish urban atmosphere and cathartic mob drama. Perfecting yet another Hispanic accent, Pacino is excellent as the brooding former hood who takes a job managing a club, hoping eventually to settle in the Caribbean with his stripper girlfriend, Gail (Miller). Instead, he's suckered into abetting Kleinfeld in an ill-advised hit job. Great support from Penn in an unusual turn, and comedian John Leguizamo as a flashy, menacing thug on the rise, add to the film's high-caliber impact. So, why not do it \\"Carlito's Way\\"?
B000000WCA|5.0|i LOVE the spice girls! so happy they're getting back together! : ) this album rocks. get it! pop-py, delicious pop, and a little hip hop and r&b.
6304884419|5.0|Adapted from a one-man show written and performed by Palminteri, De Niro's directorial debut resembles another coming-of-age New York mafia drama: \\"Goodfellas.\\" But \\"Tale\\" is more nostalgic and less brutal than Scorsese's film, telling the simple story of a teen whose respect for his father's principles conflicts with the allure of a gangster's swaggering charm. Anchored by two excellent performances from De Niro and Palminteri, the film examines issues like family bonds and loyalty in the context of the socially turbulent '60s, when racism and xenophobia were rife--all underscored by C's fledgling romance with a black girl (Taral Hicks). De Niro has a real feel for period details, too, which gives additional lift to this absorbing character study.
B000068FUS|5.0|...may be a term which is overused, however Southern Rock Opera comes close. I am a recent traveler into the realm of alt. country and have fallen head over heels for the stuff.  Southern Rock Opera transends the genre and take us back to the late 1970's when Lynard Skynard broke out of the South and took rock and roll by storm.  The live album was in just about evryone's collection.  It was played at dances, keg, parties etc.  Even though I was not from the South, Lynard Skynard spoke to me and my friends.      But did we really understand the South through Skynard's music?  Did we understand anything that came out of that region?  Southern Rock Opera get's to the core of the\\"Southern Thing\\".  I'm still not sure I get it 100%, but I do get that there is alot more than meets the eye.  And DBT get that across with intelligent and artful lyrics and kickass music
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Adapted from Sister Helen Prejean's non-fiction book by actor/director Tim Robbins, \\"Dead Man Walking\\" is an intense, harrowing account of one woman's dogged attempt to assure spiritual (if not earthly) redemption for a condemned killer. Penn is ideally cast as the convict, but Susan Sarandon's stripped-down performance as his spiritual guide is courageous, gut-wrenching work, fully meriting that year's Oscar. Unavoidably depressing, \\"Dead Man Walking\\" is also very real, shedding light into spaces we could easily ignore, but shouldn't.
B00002E233|5.0|Of course every shark film made after 1975 will get compared to Jaws.  Jaws is a classic from start to finish.  I dont consider Deep Blue Sea a classic, but its still a very good film.  It shouldnt be compared to Jaws because its really NOTHING like it other than having sharks in both movies.  Ive always enjoyed the films acting and its furious pace.  Its really an action packed thriller. Thats the best way to describe it. Deep Blue Seas special effects have been talked about ever since the film came out.  Of course, opinions vary on if the effects are good or bad.  I personally havent seen a movie where the CGI stuff looked 110% real.  Nevertheless, I think the sharks look pretty cool.  Maybe not completely real, but they look really good.  I thought the effects as a whole were always awesome in this.  The effects are some the factors that make the film good but they arent what make it great.  What makes this great is the pace and action scenes during the entire film.  It doesnt stop with the action, the whole film is like one huge ride.  Its pretty much nonstop.  Like I noted, the acting is good too.  The actors certainly did the best they could with what little dialogue they had.  Thomas Jane played his character very well and I loved his performance.  Ive seen the film numerous times and every single time Ive been entertained to the fullest.  Thats what its meant to be is entertaining, not a huge epic.  I loved this from the first viewing.  I think that its underrated and deserves a lot more credit.  I recommend it to those who like a good thriller or action movie.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This superlative drama by theater director Sam Mendes peers at the dark side of American middle-class life with ripe, risqu&eacute; humor and aching poignancy. Both screenwriter Alan Ball and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall were honored along with Mendes at the 1999 Academy Awards for their evocation of suburban alienation, but Kevin Spacey, whose cool, cynical narration constitutes the film's central nervous system, deserved all the acclaim he received for bringing Lester to life (including a Best Actor Oscar). Working in a subplot involving Lester's new neighbors, an unhinged Marine (Chris Cooper) and his artsy, drug-dealing son (Wes Bentley), Mendes gives this \\"Beauty\\" a gut-wrenching finale that completes Lester's transformation.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|Shot on location in Tornatore's hometown of Bagheria, Sicily, this gorgeously nostalgic semi-autobiographical film pays tribute to the magic and wonderment of movie-going while spinning a bittersweet wartime tale about love and lingering disappointment. A masterly evocation of time and place, mood and feeling spiced with Fellini-esque humor, the decades-long story gingerly unfolds alongside well-chosen clips from Lang, Renoir, and Welles. Tornatore's bold direction of spunky young actor Cascio and Marco Leonardi, who plays Toto as a lovestruck teen, adds to the ease with which we identify with his predicaments. And Noiret is superb as the humble but soulful Alfredo. Winner of an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, \\"Paradiso\\" will capture your heart and imagination.
0060755598|5.0|My husband and I have learned  a lot from this book. We knew these things before the book, but never really thought they would influence our business. Very informative and interesting.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Splendidly combining live-animal action with Jim Henson-esque animatronics, Noonan's irresistible \\"Babe\\" is a story about flouting convention and realizing one's potential. With its live menagerie of talking ducks, sheep, dogs, and a Greek chorus of mice mirroring the human pecking order, this Oscar-nominated film puts an intelligent, absorbing spin on self-betterment. Clever, rousing entertainment for everyone in your stable.

Since I've finished the book, I've let my friends pass it around the circle and haven't gotten it back yet (on the 5th friend)!
0783219695|5.0|A nail-bitingly tense and heroic tale of survival-against-the-odds based on the actual Apollo 13 crisis, Howard's Oscar-winning drama rekindles the exhilarating enthusiasm the nation felt during the first flights to the moon--and also draws on the collective anxiety that pooled in the wake of the Challenger explosion. Even without this context, \\"Apollo 13\\" is a grippingly authentic story, crisply helmed by Howard and superbly acted by a first-rate cast including Hanks, Bacon, Paxton, Harris, and Gary Sinise--most of whom prepared with zero-gravity flights at the director's insistence.
067003830X|5.0|This is one of the most interesting nonfiction books that I have *ever* read.  I found the book fascinating, but lest that be chalked up to my being a psychologist, my husband the computer scientist found it fascinating, too.<br /><br />Scientists used to believe that the brain was relatively fixed and unchanging -- some of them still believe that -- but recent research shows that the brain is much more mutable than biologists, psychologists, physicians (and any other scientists who studied brains) had ever thought.<br /><br />For example, anecdotal evidence had long supported the idea that blind people hear better than sighted people, but scientists pooh-poohed this idea, saying that there was no mechanism for that to occur. Well, they recently discovered that the area of the brain usually called the visual cortex is taken over for auditory processing in blind people. So blind folks have twice as much brain space devoted to processing sounds, which means that they really do hear better, and now we know why. Scientists were astounded to discover that the \\"visual\\" cortex was really just brain space that could be used for anything.<br /><br />Psych 101 and Bio 101 textbooks often have a picture in them that shows which areas of the brain control which bodily functions, and this is all presented as fixed and unchanging.  Imagine our surprise to learn that the brain can make fairly large shifts in just a few days -- for example, if you blindfold somebody for five days, the area of their brains that's usually called the visual cortex starts using large sections of itself to process touch and sound, and this change is made in as little as two days.  Two days!<br /><br />The book is not just theoretical, though -- the author is interested in the theory, but he's even more interested in how all of this can be applied to better the lives of real people.  He talks about people with strokes who've learned to walk again, people with vestibular problems who've learned to substitute something else for their missing vestibular system, people who've been helped with ADHD, autism, retardation, and many other \\"incurable\\" conditions by altering their brains.<br /><br />The downside of the book is that the author is a Freudian, so there are some annoying comments about how Freud knew it all along, but if you can overlook that, it's all fascinating.  The author does an excellent job of drawing the reader in with a story about a real person, then elaborating on the ideas by talking about studies that show the basic principles and their implications, then explaining how this can be used to ameliorate or even cure conditions that were considered incurable.<br /><br />This book blew me away!<br /><br />The chapter titles will give you more information about the subject matter:<br /><br />1.

630542828X|5.0|Produced by Robert Redford and based on the best-selling book by Jonathan Harr, this gripping, literate enviro-action legal drama is the classic David and Goliath story--the little people versus big industry--told with gusto in a decidedly unpredictable fashion. \\"Action\\" features a stellar cast, notably John Lithgow as the trial judge, and Robert Duvall as Jerome Facher, the formidable opposing counsel. Also great is William H. Macy, playing Jan's anxious accountant. It may sound dry as paper, but this absorbing courtroom drama grabs you by the throat and never lets go.
0571225381|5.0|The story of The Remains of the Day unfolds in a strange but effective way. The narrator is Mr. Stevens, the key character in the novel, and it is his voice that tells the increasingly revealing tale of his life as a 'gentleman's gentleman'.<br /><br />However, Ishiguro does not simply allow Stevens to give us a memoir of his life from the perspective of advanced years. Instead Stevens records his motoring trip across England as if he is keeping an hourly diary, perhaps spoken into a dictaphone (if such technology had existed in the mid-1950s when the main story is set). This device allows us to experience each stage of the journey as it happens and, more importantly, Steven's growing self-awareness as he tries to piece together the significance of events from his past life.<br /><br />The writing style reflects the period and the character of Stevens beautifully. As narrator, he seems unable or unwilling to acknowledge the emotions that always threaten to unseat the 'dignity' to which he aspires. In his conversations with Miss Kenton, he uses language to preserve decorum at all costs. Passion is his enemy and he fights a lifelong battle against it.<br /><br />In Mr. Stevens, Ishiguro has given us one of the greatest creations in all of English literature. It is a wonderful accomplishment and the author fully deserves every plaudit and honour he has received for this masterpiece.
B00003CX95|5.0|Epic, grand-scale moviemaking at its best, Gibson's Oscar-winning tale of heroism and courage in 1300s Scotland marked a sensational triumph in the director's chair for the durable star. Ruggedly charismatic, Gibson plays a peaceful man reluctantly drawn into the violent drift of history, after which he becomes a ferocious leader and combatant. Sophie Marceau is alluring as Isabelle, a stunning English princess who draws Wallace's eye and heart, but the film really blazes thanks to Gibson's savage, jaw-dropping battle sequences. Even at three hours, \\"Braveheart\\" never loses its interest or intensity.
0606297758|5.0|You know it, when you have had a bad day at work, so you just go home, and you pull on your favourite woollen jumper - the one where you can smell the wool mix from the last time you washed it as you slip it over your head, and curl up with your favourite book.    So often to kill a mocking bird will be that book.    Life-affirming, that's probably a fair description - the passage at the end of Part 1, where Atticus is explaining to Jem about Mrs Henry Lafayette Dubose and courage, is a favourite.
B0000A7W14|5.0|Singleton's urgent, moving drama deals head-on with a raft of tough subjects--the allure of thug life, inner-city poverty, racism--without losing its virtuous heart or universal appeal. Fishburne is terrific as the fiery, streetwise dad who schools Gooding's likable, college-bound Tre with some important life lessons. But the strongest performance belongs to rapper-actor Ice Cube, a troubled, combative teen with a criminal record who nevertheless remains loyal to his childhood buddies. Just 23 when \\"Boyz\\" hit theaters, Singleton earned two Oscar nods for his gritty, poignant story of strife.
1400032717|5.0|My mum is a teacher and often worked at special schools, taking my brother and me along to help if we had a curriculum day.    I found Mark Haddon's observation of autism to be very perceptive and his use of maps, diagrams, puzzles and prime numbers to carry us along with him effective.    His ability to challenge logical reasoning and the \\"normal\\" view of the world was also thought provoking.    I was reminded of a line in a book by Roddy Doyle - when the mother is standing on the toilet screaming in fear because of a mouse at her feet, and her young son, hearing the commotion, comes to investigate, and seeing the mouse, over-joyed, asks his mum if they can get a mouse for Christmas.  His mother, in a flash of brilliance explains, no (why not?) because it will scare the reindeer.
B0001I561E|5.0|Following up on the success of \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" this handcrafted animated reworking of the Arabic fairy tale by the Disney team features a perfect blend of magic-carpet-ride fantasy, romance, and of course a toe-tapping songbook courtesy of Alan Menken. But the biggest attraction is Williams, in full manic mode as the witty, motor-mouthed, hilariously punchy bottle spirit. Most of his one-liners will fly past younger viewers, leaving adults to appreciate the zip and zing of his pop-culture-referencing lampoons. See \\"Aladdin\\" with or without the kids; its whirlwind pleasures are universal.
