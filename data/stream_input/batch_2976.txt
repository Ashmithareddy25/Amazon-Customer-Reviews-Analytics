B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Lord of the Rings trilogy was fantastic and once again Peter Jackson brings this awesome world to life! Bless
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I think it is going to still be awesome in the future because it is always so fun to play
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The first Star trek was flippin' awesome so this one had to be as well. This is probably one of the best cast and crew to assemble
B006G85FBO|2.0|I definitely was expecting more about the story of the big G.<br />Story is interesting and some really interesting chapter, like the one about the really first days of the company.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It is a fun game to try especially if you like a slight challenge in thinking skills but not a hard one. You get a free bonus board if you write a review.
0307887898|4.0|So far the best book about entrepreneurship I have read. The right mix between examples and scientific method for startup.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Somewhat formulaic. Still found this &#34;Tom Cruise is one bad mutha$&@er&#34; watchable. Fight scenes are well done and credible.<br /><br />Probably not much fun for women to watch.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Hilarious it has great perspectives and it amused me! I would reccomend it to anyone! Especially if you're having a baby!
0345529057|5.0|Excellent condition, was really impressed. Had a flood in my house a while ago, all my books were ruined.This box set made the start of the re-vamping of my book collection go smoothly :)
B004KPLVV8|5.0|I loved it. ra ra re kick em in the knee. ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|You can't go wrong with a little MJ Moonwalker. Bought for my 9 year old niece because she just loves it. My wife has this on VHS so it was great to find it on bluray. Will make a great gift.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|love it.ra ra re kick em in the knee ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee. wa wa.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|If you enjoy Jane Austen, this is a classic production of her novel SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  It is full of engaging actors who brighten the screen like Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman and others.  It caught the humor and depth of Austen's novel.  The scenery is scrumptious - especially love the cottage home the sisters move into.  I can watch this film over and over again.  It should charm you.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I loved it. ra ra re kick em in the knee. ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|LassPass works great but the android apt is not upfront with the fact that there is a monthly fee for it's use. Needless to say sense I have already committed to the service over the last year, now I'm unable to check email on my mobile devices.
B002JVWR4K|5.0|love it.ra ra re kick em in the knee ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee. wa wa.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show scares the crap out of me but I can't stop watching it. Jessica Lange's performance is brilliant. I have always loved any show she has been in but this show.... what can I say. Where was the love at the Emmy's!!! I have not watched Homeland but it would be hard for me to think that Claire Danes performance is anything close to Jessica's.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|love it.ra ra re kick em in the knee ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee. wa wa.
0385528787|2.0|WHY??? For the life of me I can't see the point to this book. I loved the first two books in the trilogy but this one was just pointless. It didn't add anything to the story and it was so tedious to read. Actually I have three pages left and I can't seem to muster the energy to slog through it. I should have put it down after the chapter on OH \\"F\\".<br /><br />If you loved the first two books in this series I suggest you just leave it there. Don't bother with the third, so disappointing.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I loved it. ra ra re kick em in the knee. ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really like this game. I like most logic and puzzle games. This one is your standard logic picture puzzle but it has more levels than ones I've played before.
B009AMALGM|5.0|I loved it. ra ra re kick em in the knee. ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love, love, love the series!  We have to limit ourselves to one or two episodes a day!  It's hard not to just sit and watch the whole season at once!
B00867HDTA|4.0|It does not have competitions , but the challenges can be hard to beet. I rated 4 stages cause its not that bad. It is entertaining when your bored. Derp approval!<br />:3
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We have become addicted to Downton Abbey!  We just love it!  Can't wait for the new season to come out!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game lets me get new dragons and i just mix em' up a little bit and sometimes i'll get gem dragons! DERP approval!!!! :3
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This mixer is awesome. For the price and size you can't go wrong..I'm a vocalist and  I use this for work five nights a week. I never leave home without it. Even if my dj has all his fancy equipment. I just plug in to his stuff with this. I can do my own settings and its small enough to fit in my computer bag, along with my 15&#34; computer and a sure microphone.  Great buy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow. Before I read the book, my friend soiled it for me. I bought the book before the summer started and took a long break from it the whole season. Coming back to finish it, it was hard to keep track of all of the insane and jaw dropping (literally) events that took place. There are no words to describe the genius and awe of this book. Wow.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  I never get tired of playing.  It works well, gives hints, allows you to select random or winning hands, and replay if you choose to.  And it's FREE.  Great!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book was mad<br /><br />e in 2009 so it's really out of date and needs to be updated second if you look up a word with prefixes added to the end, then it will use that same word in the sentence and you're not supposed to do that and third, since it was made in 2009 it doesn't have current information  this thing is so terrible Michael Jackson is alive.  HATE THIS BOOK
B000VK99Z6|4.0|It started out a bit slow.  Actually, not really slow, just not very funny.  But as the action picked up the movie got much better, and by the end it was pretty enjoyable.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love it, just wish it were actually free. I was really getting into it and then it wanted me to pay for the rest of it :(
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|This was a good movie.  It kept me interested and the time went fast while watching it.  I enjoyed it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|easy to identify pictures, and I love the different shapes of puzzle. I love the fact you light up the tiles that are free to match because it is hard to tell.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was too smart for me it had words I didn't understand . But only get this book if you are smart.good luck if you get this book If you aren't smart!ok soooooo bye BYE!!!!!!!!
B00168ML1G|3.0|From looking at the picture of the item, I was led to believe that it would come with the slipcover. It didn't. As a collector, I was pretty disappointed because it feels incomplete.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Amelie is a captivating film with a Felini-ish feel.  Tautou's expressions convey more than her words -  a masterful performance.
140006922X|1.0|Very biased against Israel and pro arab. The writers knowledge of the areas he describes in the book is very poor. This book is a waste of money.
B0028O34SG|4.0|Just got back from London where we saw this EXACT production (different cast though) at Covent Garden. I was a bit astonished that to my eyes, the bits of business from this 2009 recording were reproduced exactly in the 2013 incarnation of the production. The cast of the recording is nearly ideal and the supernumeraries who play the household staff and mingle with the chorus when appropriate actually add to the verisimilitude of the production. I've seen every available video but one of this opera (still waiting for the Glyndebourne production to arrive) and own about 15 versions of the work on CD and LP. Overall, this is among the most satisfying.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|I am so grateful my daughter loves Shaun the Sheep.  It is completely delightful, and unlike other shows for tots, I can sit and watch this over and over.
B00E66QPCG|3.0|While I totally agree with the three strategies the author covers them quickly and not in depth. His story is interesting but this 'book' is more an article. A quick read, but don't expect any tactical steps to help you trade.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Anything with Emma Watson in it is worth your 90 minutes.  This however provided a bit more with a nice story line and an interesting finish.
B00E3D7WGU|3.0|It is a shame that this EXCELLENT concert only  had a CD-R live CD. Shame on you, Interscope and Madge.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|It is a bit bulky so make sure your case has room for it, but other than that it is a great product.
B00CY5Y37U|5.0|Great 7&#34;edit single versions and &#34;Valentine&#34; new version, one of my all time favorites! Love it! Runaway Horses will always be one of Belinda's finest moments!
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|I am so happy Mazzy Star has released a new album!  It is very reminiscent of Among My Swan, which was also a wonderful album.  They have stayed true to their sound and I love it!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|If I base this review in audio only, it will a very low grading score. But the concert is so good, it doesn't matter to me. It's one of Madonna's best concerts EVER, along with Confessions, Blond Ambition, ReInvention and Who's That Girl! (Still can't digest the heavily R&B influenced &#34;Sticky & Sweet&#34;)
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great story. Hated to have it end...it didn't...<br />I love relearning about the god and goddesses<br />and seeing their use in modern day. In high school<br />my friend and I did a scrapbook on the Greek god<br />and goddesses and how their names are appropriately<br />used in today's products.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The controller is solidly constructed but this new version lacks the &#34;touch&#34; of it's predecessors. The buttons are either too stiff or too light.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen Stills since the Buffalo Springfield days. When I saw he had formed a new band, I immediately purchased this CD. I was not disappointed. It is an excellent album. Stills is in top form and he and Kenny Wayne Shepard are a perfect pairing. Along with Barry Goldberg, this is an excellent band.
B0012GMXLU|5.0|Pure Motorhead in good shape. No mistakes it works. You will know what means &#34;We are Motorhead and we play Rock&Roll&#34;
B001JP5JRY|5.0|Legen... Wait for it... Dary. Now here are the rest of the 15 required words for this review so the message stops popping up.
0385537816|5.0|So glad I purchased this trilogy. A must have. Surely not missing the movie! Go charlie hunnam!! U wont regret it!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I found this movie to be a flop, boring, no story line, didnt make any sense.<br />Wouldnt recommend this movie to my worst enemy.
B008Y212PI|4.0|If you like puzzles and I do,  these are nice and calming to do without being overly hard. They are still challenging  so they rate high on my list.
0761171703|5.0|This book is filled with inspiring quotes and amazing pictures! I would definitely recommend it to other dancers or anyone in general!
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Excellent. Even the 2nd time.  Read it many years ago; and forgot exactly what happened and when.  The first show on PBS years ago was outstanding.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|Really love this game! Combines the best of several strategy genres. A lot do fun without the computer infrastructure. Great.
B00D6DVSAE|1.0|I had high expectations for this new Sting release.  And yes, I know it is from a forthcoming theatre production.  But jeez can it any more dreary?  Dullness and monotony abound.  My ears ache for some sort of melody.  Better off dusting off your copy of \\"The Soul Cages\\" which covers the same themes and is listenable.  Simply awful.
B0007LGCB8|4.0|This is the 1st pair of Keen's, I have owned  Teva's before but they don't last more than a year if you wear them everyday and walk a lot the retired life if hard. Very comfortable and finish is top notch nice thick sole, the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is you will get a lot more sand and tiny rocks in your footbed and the only way to get them out is to remove the sandle. Get a pair bottom line, now if they just made them in the U.S.A
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Running Time approx. 2 hours 10min. Hi-def. Picture and DTS-HD 7.1 sound, widescreen. Five (5) star production, one (1) star performance. This movies storyline is very messy and all over the place. It has no real focus. The movie leaves you with more questions than answers. The origins of the bad guys are unanswered and are misleading. The entire movie is a quirky mess. However, just for the pure sake of entertainment it will fill your time very well. I thought this movie was too long; I just wanted it to end after the first hour, which seemed like 2hours because it was so dry. The real action occurs (in) the last 20 minutes of a 2 hour movie. All acting, sets, props, wardrobe, make-up, and effects were spot on. This was NOT the best Iron man movie...they really need to come up with a solid storyline for a Billionaire (man-child) and his flying super suit, with nothing better to do. I definitely will not be watching this movie again; it really was NOT that good, it was downright disappointing. This movie was pieces of strung together special effects, added here and there, but lacking a storyline to tie it all together. However, on a boring Friday night, it makes ideal entertainment. Thank you.
B0033WSK3Q|5.0|I only pay the Blu-Ray premium for things that are visually wonderful, like Hero, Mongol and Blade Runner.  This was a no-brainer: both visually stunning and inexpensive.  That aside, the story is excellent, and Johnny Depp is delightfully insane.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Really love this album. Dylan sounds more relaxed and honest than ever. Whole bag of treas. Favorites are New Morning, time Passes Slowly and Went to see the Gypsy but it's all good.
067144901X|5.0|My 14 month daughter loves this book and making the animal sounds.  It´s a nice size for her Little hands.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Not the best of series, but definitely worth a watch. I may watch it again! Lots of good action in this movie.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|I can see if its the year 2006 and the show had 8-9 22 episode seasons for it to be 209 dollars on Bluray.<br /><br />But it is the year 2013, DVD sets are no longer the price they used to be, and AMC who are notoriously cheap, greedy pieces of crap are simply GOUGING the people who made their network what it is and striking while Breaking Bad is hot with this BS price.<br /><br />If the fans of this epic show ganged together and said NO to this 209 dollar ripoff, it will be 109 and REASONABLE by Xmas. Say no to AMC and their nonsense. Lol, do some research and see how that network treats the shows that made them. They nickeled and dimed Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and even Walking Dead with their nonsense. Its mind boggling.<br /><br />As for the show itself....Breaking Bad is the best of the best. I may wind up re-ranking it as the shock of an amazing season wears off, but as of now I have it number 1 all time over The Wire, Sopranos, Buffy/Angel, and The Shield.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|We did this book in our book club, at times I thought it was a little slow.  Our discussion in club about this book was really interesting.  It seemed to open up all our relationships with our spouse and children.  It was a great book to read and discuss.
B008N1LL42|1.0|The story itself is very tedious and lacks of imagination. There is no logic at all and that makes the whole story very strange.<br />The supposed sophisticated equipments are designed so coarse that they just looks like a crashed box made with iron sheet.<br />Even my 8 years old son cannot endure the story and he thought he can make at least a much better story than that.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A lot of fun definitely recommend. Difficult sometimes but still fun. I'm just trying to fill as many as words as I can so I can unlock the last level so I don't have to use Facebook
B005OCHOZS|2.0|The book does a good job of saying the same thing over and over.  It was boring. Then, once you get about 70% through the book.  It's over and you have a bunch of index pages.  Good message, but the same story could have been made into a quick blog post.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great way to revisit and follow up on &#34;The Shinning.&#34; Getting to know Danny again and his most recent journeys was very interesting. Looking forward now to another follow up in several years with Dan and his new friends.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Easy read on Flt to and from London. Informative. And since 11 more words are required ill droll along to make that number.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|So far so good. Downloaded to manage downloads on kindle. I was able to find and delete downloads with this app
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Every man wants to be like Jack Reacher!  He's just a no-nonsense, kick-butt kind of guy that enters into this scene and feels like he needs to set things straight.<br />The only thing I didn't care for was;  Lee Child seems to introduce some ANTI-Christian attitude into the mix here.  Of course he does it through Reacher's character.  And maybe it is a feeling that is more common among those around the nation (that are NOT in my circle of friends).  BTW,,,, the &#34;Christian&#34; characters in this book NEEDED to be slandered by Reacher and deserved the negativity!  But I'm just saying:  don't paint with a 'broad brush' about ALL religious people being kooky.<br />Steve
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show -- drama, tension, comedy. One of the best shows on right now. The whole Bates in prison subplot got a bit boring, but he's out by now.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This one goes back to Reachers beginnings in the sense that you realize how his MP training/experience make him the man he has become.<br />Well written suspense and detective work are well-woven into the story-line!  Good read!!<br />Steve
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I color correct my monitors once a month and they make my photos match what you see and I can judge my prints. This process takes 12 minutes a monitor.
B000P0J024|5.0|If you like the Wilburys you'll love this set! It's terrific!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love evernote. It keeps me organized and efficient. I use it for work , personal stuff and inspirational notes to keep me positive. You will love it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Just as good as the card game! In game purchases aren't expensive, and the campaign is fun. I love playing this game!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Everything comes together in this movie...good writing, good acting, excellent soundtrack, props that look real, and a great Hollywood budget that doesn't hold back.  A group of young teenagers love writing and producing films.  One night while filming with a traintrack in the background, a train coming through town has a horrific accident caused by a high school science teacher who runs into the train with his truck.  The government had a secret cargo on the train which puts everyone in danger, and the kids got it all on film!<br /><br />This movie has many stories interwoven which keeps it interesting.  You really care about these kids and what happens to them.  There is a great looking \\"monster\\".  I can't say more without giving away a spoiler.<br /><br />It's always fun to discover such a well-done movie.  Highly recommend!
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|its heavy, but must be to carry the signal so far. i use it at home and when traveling. one
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|This movie was really FUN!  Although I knew there was a really big twist and I was watching for it, I was completely taken by surprise!  LOVE THAT!  This movie was a big budget film...no cheap shots.  The writing was tight, and there was no down time.  You started this roller coaster ride from the very beginning.  Not only the writing, but the acting by a top-notch cast pulled you in.  A fast-paced movie full of wonderful magic tricks that are woven into huge felony capers absolutely kept us on the edge of our seats.  I can almost guarantee you will enjoy this movie from start to finish.  ....Now you don't.
B0091LS0BU|3.0|mc cartney needs to stick with what he does best......rock.  all the fawning over him by his guests was naciating.  i know he is great.
B002HSSAY6|3.0|Today it may seem dated but it's still a great movie! And how Henry Fonda's part was deliberate from how he was normally portrayed is the Best!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome show, well written, well picked actors and I suppose it helps because I am a pre-law student as well.
B0089LOG02|4.0|An interesting, easy read about a part of American history most of Americans know very little, if anything, about.<br />The author's  skillful contrast comparison of the lives of the two main characters Vivian and Molly,  draws the reader in effortlessly.  You find yourself feeling their anxiety, fear, grief, hope, and love as their loss filled lives unfold<br />and intertwine.  I enjoyed the two evenings I spent getting to know the characters and their heart wrenching stories.  Not great literature perhaps but, an engrossing story well told, and a very enjoyable and heart warming read.  I would recommend it
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|great flick cruse was fit for this. movie was exciting and kept you watching. had great plot and will make you think. good job.
B00BBA6FOI|3.0|There were certainly some important points made in how women negotiate (or do not) working conditions and how they seem to be far too ready to give up on their careers when their professional ambition clashes with family management. Nevertheless, given the extremely privileged position the author and her partner are in, I am not sure how far-reaching this book actually is. If one cannot afford the excellent childcare they and their family could afford to enjoy, I am afraid there aren't many alternatives presented. On the other hand, the analysis of why women drop out of the work force like flies on a hot summer day is quite accurate and realistic. All in all, it was an ok read....
B00DW36G32|3.0|this video was good but kind of slow. the filming and background was great. but was slow. it did have kind of a surprising ending.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I am 24 years old and this is still one of my favorites. Beautiful message and awesome movie. Love it!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Love this!  It came in perfect condition.  Macklemore is an amazing artist with great messages in his music.  I highly recommend this album.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love, love, love this show and the Dowager cracks me up! I think I was born in the wrong century!
B000Q9INWC|5.0|Good book, if nothing else it gives you a different view on how to deal with your financial life. I recommend this book.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|not bad app but some very annoying limitations. such as not being able to tag people in a post or share to others time line. also if you click on a post and then try to go back it takes for ever to load all the previous posts before it. also the message, friends, notifications bar disaappears unless you scroll all the way back to the top.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A new writer for me. Once you get into it , you don't want to put it down. The thing is ,I found it took a long time to reach that point.<br />So because of that it makes a great book when you want one to last awhile.<br />  That is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.<br />  K
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It didn't turn out at all like I expected...Weird and creepy.  I look forward to more...any suggestions from fellow readers?
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Amazing. Truth at its core! This book affirms all I have ever learned and makes it easy to apply. Great!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched all three seasons while recovering from surgery and I loved all of them. It has got it all, with decor and costumes to match. Well done producers of Downton Abbey!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game! My son and I had a blast trying to figure out the challenges. Can't wait for more levels. :)
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I am very happy to have new NIN music to listen to and learn before the Nov. show in Seattle
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this game but it does get frustrating at times. It seems as though just when  you have a definite win, the computer gets double after double after double. Also, it seems as though the computer gets a double quite frequently on the first roll so it can block more spaces without spreading out too much. Of course, if you read about it, they say it's because you aren't playing well.....lol.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Been researching these, and looking for one, and this was a great price, I just love it!. Exactly what I expected!

0375869026|5.0|Hearing an interview with the author R.J. Palacio on NPR recently intrigued me, and I just finished reading her amazing novel, \\"Wonder.\\" I won't give anything away, but I was blown away by the content and emotional depth and refinement of this beautiful story. Thank you so much \\"R.J.\\" for the wonderful expression of YOUR humanity in your first novel. You've done a truly noble service for us all. I'm impressed by your motivation and reason for writing this story in the first place, as stated in the interview, your personal experience encountering a severely deformed child in public and being at a loss for an appropriate response, and natural interaction. Keep up the great work! I'll be watching you, for your next creation. Thank you, heart to heart.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a really fun app, and it keeps me busy!! :D  I'll probably play it until I run out of data space! Anyways, the app is more fun than it looks.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Sheryl crow is one of my all-time favorite artists. That said, there's been an album or two in the last five or six years that haven't been in her better repertoire. This album isn't one of them. She's right at home in country because it's not much different than her normal style.
0385474547|4.0|Bought for teen son - required reading for school.  Print is easy to read and he finished reading the book within two days.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Purchased these for my wife while she was home on bed rest. She enjoyed watching these almost as much as her collection of the seasons of Friends. Nice price for these and cheaper than purchasing the exact same items at Target, even when shipping costs are factored in.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is very fun to play, the graphics on the kindle fire are priceless. I think I would recommend this to anyone who owns a kindle fire and who loves this sort of puzzle, very exciting and I love it, 5 stars very much well worth it too, Id pay to have this app, even though I got it on free app of day, which makes owning it more amazing!! Enjoy!!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Purchased these for my wife while she was home on bed rest. She enjoyed watching these almost as much as her collection of the seasons of Friends. Nice price for these and cheaper than purchasing the exact same items at Target, even when shipping costs are factored in.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I haven't found an app this good in a while, and I have to say its very very fun, great graphics and keeps you on edge! I cannot put it down its addicting too! I love it and 5 stars is well deserved
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Nice unit and works well for no more expensive than it was. Nice and handy to carry in a pocket or backpack when hunting/fishing and works well for smooth and serrated blades both.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This book is literally a lifesaver for me.  I have read other sources about low carb diets and this puts it together in concise and useful ways.  It makes sense in a world of conflicting diet advice.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Purchased these for my wife while she was home on bed rest. She enjoyed watching these almost as much as her collection of the seasons of Friends. Nice price for these and cheaper than purchasing the exact same items at Target, even when shipping costs are factored in.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I really Loved it.

B000OVLBF8|5.0|Loved it.
B0035JNTA6|4.0|This is one of those movies I can watch a million times and its still hilariously entertaining. One of my favorites.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Loved it.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|Cathy Bates and Jessica Tandy nail it in this tear jerker! Mary Stuart Masterson is the topping on the cake. A must see for the basic lessons in life on how friends should be!B
B001NHNG64|3.0|This is the second Jack Teacher book I've read (and in published order).  Two does not a pattern make but...<br /><br />Overall, the books are worht he reading, but Lee Child seems to think two ingredients are required:<br /><br />-- Sadistic violence from the bad guys<br />-- The primary woman falling for Reacher and/or having sex with him<br /><br />Neither is terribly graphic (especially the latter), but I think &#34;normal&#34; violence would have been just as effective, and the sex added nothing to either novel (especially this one).<br /><br />Overall the writing and plot are good enough to get you to read to the end without regret.  However, this time I would suggest the movie is better than either of the books--including Reacher being a more appealing character.<br /><br />Speaking of movies, I rate them:<br /><br />Would pay to watch them more than once in the theater<br />Would pay to watch them in the theater<br />Would pay to watch them on DVD<br />Would watch them if I didn't have to pay<br />Would not watch them even if free<br />Would not watch it even I was paid to<br /><br />This would be the equivalent of one I'd pay to watch on DVD...especially if it was as cheap as Redbox. :-)
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Great sound. Very mellow, smooth and soothing when you want to relax and feel good. I would recommend to others.
B000XJSL9U|5.0|Love his movies, I started to watch on the flight from maui I couldnt hear it, but I knew it was good....so had to buy when I got home.
B000023VR6|5.0|love it. classic!! can listen to it anytime and enyjoy it. it has alot of jammin songs that you can play.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is Dream Theater's most balanced, diverse, and refreshing album in years. With Mangini writing within the creative process, the drum parts are very musically aware, as every note is placed perfectly and embellishes the music effectively. Listen to this album multiple times, and its brilliance will be revealed over time.
B008P9M614|5.0|I've loved Laurie since the mid 80's comedy show, A Bit Of (Stephen)Fry And Laurie.  After seeing that series, you can understand what gives him his range on the House shows.  I generally don't watch TV, so i missed the first pass at House,MD;  Even through i thought it would be a comedy, it took quite a while to check it out on Ntflx.  Boy, was i glad i did. The whole cast play very deeply, but Laurie is an incredible showman: pianist, guitarist, juggler, sleight of hand details which make his performance deep not only verbally, but physically as well.  Everybody on the show pulls their weight, too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Superb acting, fascinating storylines, and great pacing make this show truly a delight to watch. Every single actor is top academy worthy. This must see TV at its finest.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I'm a huge zombie fan and this movie just didn't measure up.  These zombies seemed completely uninterested in eating which is the very reasons zombie are scary and they were way too athletic.  I read the book and it is NOTHING like it.  It could have been soooooo much more if they slowed down the camera so we could actually see the action and they spent less time on relationships - more time on the crisis in each moment.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Costumes were excellent, and most of the actors actually resembled who in real life they were supposed to be. A very realistic portrayal of life during that time period
B00F35B8F8|3.0|The entire Pike storyline was changed to give the storyline  momentum. Spock's relationship with Pike unacknowledged.  Casting for Khan was totally wrong.  Ummm... that guy is supposed to fill the shoes of Ricardo Montiban?  They nailed it with Spock and Kirk, A- for Bones. I give them B+ for Chechov, uhura, Sulu and Mr. Scott.    I mean the had a lot of AMAZING talent and a cool plot if they stuck with the \\"non-Khan\\" aspect.  i love the franchise and I hope they will keep at it for many sequels but they really have to create more new material or else be more committed to the original details.  We are Trekkies and we know our s***.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Laurence Olivier is by far the best narrator for this kind of documentary. The cinematography update is pretty good for 1974.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I loved the look and feel of the future (although I can't help but wonder how they keep everything to clean) but the film was kind of predictable and the storyline involving planet inhabitents wasn't developed well enough.  they had 2 stories going and it was too much for 1 movie
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show was written and acted out perfectly. Lots of laughs! I think I even learned a thing or two. Worth watching!
B008220BP2|5.0|Like this a lot because like &#34;Near Dark&#34;  it tells the story from a totally different perspective, the zombie's.  Had so many funny moments without going too far like &#34;Zombie Land&#34;.
B00AEFYK5M|5.0|I ordered Love Story and Olivers Story. I enjoyed both of them, but Oliver's story was the best as far as enjoyment.,
B008Y212PI|5.0|I'm a first time player. Great instructions and lots of fun.  The graphics are really beautiful! Great game for logical thinkers.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Great story, most of it drawn from true history.  Steve Buscemi is excellent as the lead.  This series is engrossing and addictive.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|While just like the first one, many of the technical details will annoy die hard fans, such as a star-system hopping transporter and phaser blasts that rip through enterprise shields like they weren't even up.  Benedict Cumberpatch does an incredible job revisiting the classic character of Khan.  While it is interesting that he's gone from an Indian Sikh to an Englishman without explanation, the gravitas of Cumberpatch's performance quickly allows you to forget it.  In this film, Kirk gains new insight into what it means to be captain, and for the first time really faces death, but with a new twist.  Highly recommended for fans new and old, as well as all new comers.
0062238310|5.0|This is a copy/paste from my Goodreads.com review. Please read more of my reviews!<br />Loved it! Checked out DVD Season One from my local library to find out what all the hype was about and all I can say is that now I understand why everyone is so addicted to this show! So when I discovered the library had this copy of the scripts I snatched this book right up and devoured it. They are perfect for something to tide me over while I wait for Seasons Two and Three. I'll probably buy the Season Two scripts since library doesn't have them...yet. The commentary is fascinating and anyone who loves to write will learn a lot about perfecting the craft of storytelling because Julian Fellowes is truly a master of dialogue.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I ask, does it not bother anyone else that the Kindle price is $2 more expensive than the Hardcovr price?  When I asked Amazon about this - they said that they do not set the pricing rather the publisher does.  SO - I will NOT buy this book.  I have been a fan of King's since the 80's and have read every single piece he has produced - but not this one.  I think it is ridiculous that I paid a premium for the Kindle in order to save (no printing costs, no store costs, no shipping costs, etc. etc) money and now they are charging more for the digital copy than the paper copy.  Ridiculous!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This album is great in stereo, but if you have a kickin audio system,you should opt for the deluxe version so you get the multi-channel version. It's true multichannel OR a dolby digital 5.1. There's a huge difference between the standard DD 5.1 and the multichannel version. Great material, great jamming, and a surround version to blow your friends away! Much recommended!
B000069KGM|5.0|If you are a Chicago fan, this is sweet music, with their signature horn section.  Used CD with great price & service.
0762777931|5.0|I was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in January. I bought this book and it helped me in so many ways.  Even if you dont make all the changes it will encourage you to make some changes.  I have loaned it to several friends and I am still waiting to get it back.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game really is the best game ever. very addicting and lots of fun. I would recommend not to wait another minute..... download it now so you can start having a bandanna bam good time.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love reading and learning about history especially in a story form. Ken Follett is an excellent story teller intertwining historical facts along with an excellent story that follows the lives of five different families prior to WWI up to 1940.

B00D8HNR2K|3.0|I believe the negative reviews associated with this album have been formed on the basis of the overall vocal tone qualities presented on this album. Not much screaming or aggression here!!! I have to admit on the first listen I initially thought the overall sound was kind of weak and had wondered, if NIN had hired John Mayer to sing a couple of songs Ha! Ha!, but it didn't take long for me to hear the depth of the music behind the modest , but interesting vocal arrangements on this album. That being said, the music is just as compelling and thought provoking as \\"the downward spiral\\" and \\"the fragile\\". If you like \\"the fragile\\" this album sounds like it should have been the follow-up to that album; definitely is in the same category of greatness. I critique albums really harshly. Three stars to me means album of the year nomination, vs. four stars (one of the best of the decade), vs. five stars meaning \\"masterpiece\\" (one of the best albums of all time). It's too early in this decade to know for sure, but this album could potentially be a four star rating along with \\"the downward spiral\\" and \\"the fragile\\", which are already four star albums in my book. I hope you all enjoy!!!!!!
B00F5FBE82|5.0|I'm going to bump this album for the rest of the year. You can vibe to every track and it has great quality.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|It is great and I can't wait to make some of the food in it, they look easy, with real ingredients.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I will represent this book to author and want to dislike nothing about the book and it`s so incredible  but I have a question about the book How did he write the whole book in one minute
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I Love ice age village it's so much fun . I Love playing with  my friends I Love buying stuff one of games has really awesome prizes
142312166X|5.0|It helps fill the gaps while waiting for the new book to come out. I simply enjoy reading this even if I technically above the age mark for these kinds of books.
B005HSL626|5.0|This was great because it was FREE!  The greatest part is that it's the full version for FREE!  This is a really fun game to play.  It does get harder the more you play, but still a lot of fun.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This was the best game I have played in a long time . I had so much fun  playing it. Loved it.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|You hear the buzz. Everyone talking about Tatiana Muslany's acting and how she was worse than snubbed for the Emmy's - find out why.<br /><br />I didn't watch this show live, I bought the DVD and watched it because of this very thing and I am here to tell you that the world was not wrong.<br /><br />Amazing show. Her acting is just BEYOND. Honestly I can't think of a single acting performance, male or female, TV or movie, that comes even slightly close to what Muslany does in Orphan Black. It is astonishing. Simply astonishing.<br /><br />The first 2 episodes are kinda set up, but after that... Wow. Honestly by episode 3 or 4 you have to remind yourself that it is only one actress playing these parts. By episode 5 you aren't even thinking about it anymore you are just enjoying the ride.<br /><br />With only 10 episodes you can easily watch this entire show on a Saturday or weekend, which is a good thing because once you step into this world you will want to keep watching. The subject matter is unique and timely and it is done in a way that is very exciting.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My grandson enjoys his F-P jumperoo. He smiles alot when playing in the jumperoo. This gives his Dad and Mom some hands off time.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|if you do the Terminator series must get all the movies to really enjoy the movies great to watch not recommended for the younger generation
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is my first time reading Jack Reacher by Lee Childs.  I enjoyed it so much I am now reading his second J.R. book
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just a nice simple game. Good color and graphics. Easy to start up. If you want an easy fun app when you have a few minutes this works..
B0089LOG02|5.0|The telling of this story about a young Irish immigrant who lost her family (a touching story in itself) and was shipped west on one of the \\"orphan trains\\" is told as comparison to the story of a teenager who has been going through the contemporary social services system.  Both stories are heartrending commentaries on both what society does to it's outliers and how those so-called outliers overcome their situations.  It is a vivid rendition of both lives and how they fit together.  It deserves my five star rating as it makes me wish I knew these people and that the book didn't end.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|I am not a gamer.  I downloaded this game for a couple of male grandchildren who are gamers (ages 4 & 8).
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Saw this one at the movies and enjoyed it so much, I added it to our collection. Of course, being set here in Arkansas really made it a must to see and collect. But its worth the watch.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|I have not figured out how to line up the aircraft for a shot.  I also do not like the process of finding a fighter of choice - it is hard.  Then, for a free game, it seems extraordinary to have to buy a fighter.
0767827791|5.0|I saw this as a child, though I didn't really remember it. Then it showed on TV and I was enthralled. William Holden and Kim Novak are a great combination and sparks fly. Definitely a classic for my collection..
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has seen season one the storylines keep you hanging I love the series and the actors are great
B0040I09RM|3.0|What is it about TV shows that showcase bad people doing bad things... seriously bad things, while any character with a potential moral compass gets killed, and usually by the stars of the show?  I watched the first 4 seasons, mostly because of 2 things - the occasional great writing, and the fervent hope that one or more of the bad characters would be killed.  But, it was the ones with a glimmer of decency in them that bought it each and every time.  Tara is the only survivor to date with that spark.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has watched the first season it  carries on the storyline and is great watching love all the characters
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|This is a really neat versatile little camera! Takes great pix, can replace a scanner for lots of applications. Easy to use, good software. Aimed at primary teachers but has lots of applications outside the schoolroom.  Think of it as a quick scanner. Smaller, compact.
0141345659|5.0|Such a heartwarming story! It is definitely a book that you need to buy and experience for yourself what everyone is talking about.
0307887448|5.0|Bought it on Audible. Listened to it five times. Finally had to buy a copy so I could mark my favorite passages. Still not tired of it!
B0055D3EFU|5.0|Was actually a pretty good movie. Story line was easy to follow..  Very good for a scary movie.  Had to go watch the second one.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I am way past teenage now.  I had a hardback copy of this wonderful book.  I read and reread it.  I have no room for books now, so I was very happy to find a kindle copy.  I will loan it to my granddaughter soon.  she already likes paranormal, scifi and discussing philosophic ideas so I am sure she will like this classic.
B009NH6JRE|1.0|I purchased it thru Amazon Australia but it is the wrong zone and I cannot play it on my DVD player
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great storyline  Not for younger kids but not too racy.  It's like reading a good book.  I can't wait for season 4.
B00B52FDXQ|1.0|I purchased it thru Amazon Australia, but it is wrong zone and not able to be played on my DVD player
0786218649|5.0|My husband has read all the Bosch books and has never been displeased with a single one; and having started to read them myself I can see why. Reading the Bosch series in order does help in understanding his character and where he is coming from. Fortunately through Amazon it is easy to get all the Bosch books.
B000FJGDS4|5.0|The price was awesome for what I got. The DVD was in awesome condition just like from the store but  for an awesome price. :)
1439102430|5.0|Tempie Brennen is at it again in this suspenseful novel. As in all series it is better when you read them in order of publication. If you are expecting all to be like the tv show you will be surprised as the format is quite different.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I love this movie to death!!! I'm like the hugest Leo fan I love all his movies and this movie just is awesome.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|this movie was nonstop action loved it! and I can watch it over and over again. would recommend it to anyone.
B00BQ83VJM|5.0|It makes it twice as nice when Harry Bosch and his brother Mick are in the same book. Fast paced, interesting - hard to put down
B00915G6MG|5.0|Am a big NCIS fan and like to watch the series in order rather than jumping around like they do on the reruns on tv.  These are quality DVDs.
B002N44XSG|3.0|Just a few short stories about Percy . The Christmas story was good. Would like to see Bob have another adventure.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|He would rate it a ten if possible.  He adores this movie and has watched it multiple times.  Loves the film and the music, has the entire score on his phone.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|A good app for a lot of different things. You can use it to relax or wake up and focus.  It gives a variety of sounds to choose from. I will be using it for a long time.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|While I thought it was a really good film, I think they over hyped it so I was left a LITTLE disappointed.  But the acting and all was incredible.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I am glad I found this product. It serves it purpose and is good quality and I'll be back for more for gifts.

B000SEKNUK|5.0|Benjamin and Rosamund Zander bring mindfulness to education. Anyone involved in shaping talent will find this a valuable and interesting text.

B001DEXDNI|5.0|It's Annie Lennox:  gorgeous,  and the voice of a goddess! Love her music and breathy style of singing!  Fast shipping quicker listening enjoyment!
B000NY12LO|5.0|I was helping my dad entertain guests at his lake house for the weekend.  I took Nineteen Minutes with me.  I don't know how many times I excused myself to go to the restroom so that I could steal away to read for ten or so minutes.  On the 150 mile drive home from the lake, I pulled off the road so I could just read for a few minutes.  I cried and cried.  I fell absolutely in love with one of the characters and couldn't believe I did.  I couldn't help it.  I will never look at a Superman lunch box the same way again.  Ever.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'd been hearing about this treasure for a while, and I was grateful to finally get a chance to share this gift.  Mr. Green certainly gets teens, and he gets the struggle anyone with a terminal illness must face.  If I could change anything about the book (and I shouldn't--it was perfect), I would end in the middle of a sentence like the book within the book did.  That would truly bring this gem full circle.  Terrific book.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Bought as a gift. It was a great movie. Would definitely recommend and we would watch over and over again
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Whether I like something or not, I often enjoy reading the remarks made by others.  I'll compare opinions and, as most of us do, determine if certain praise or criticism is reasonable.<br /><br />Regarding Hesitation Marks, most of the negative things I've read involve claims that Reznor is missing his edge, or that it's simply not classic Nine Inch Nails.  While not quite as angst-ridden as some past works, I have to say that I heard many parallels between this album and Pretty Hate Machine.<br /><br />Tracks that stood out for me were \\"Copy of A\\", \\"Came Back Haunted\\", \\"Find My Way\\", \\"Everything\\", and \\"Satellite\\".  The album begins strong with the catchy \\"Copy of A\\".  Later, there's the very pop-sounding \\"Everything\\", and includes some fun Cure-esque guitar riffs - which then shifts to a funkier vibe with the track \\"Satellite\\".  Layering seemed to be curtailed a bit on this album, with excellent transition and tempo changes throughout.<br /><br />Opinions are always a matter of taste - and I've learned to develop my own after experiencing something for myself.  The bottom line is, I was not disappointed with this effort.  Reznor has usually played by his own rules, and he's often been thoughtful in his expression...whether we approve or not.  I don't know whether maturity is involved, but in this instance, I can appreciate a notable diversity in his attitude while still remaining true to his style.<br /><br />Enjoyable...and highly recommended.
B00E9P959O|3.0|SINCE YOU CAN'T ADD 1/2 STARS - I RATE IT 3 1/2 STARS....It's better than ok<br /><br />However,<br /><br />Improvements: most guitar and bass instrument separation and detail, most clipping eliminated, Geddy's vocals very prominent, new layers and nuances revealed<br /><br />Regressions: Neil's bass drums (OMG!) sonically sound like an 80's hair band production - too bright/clicky and dominate the rest of his kit in the mix, the drums sound flat and depressed - yeah you can hear 'em, but throw on any other Rush album sans the first and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />SUSTAIN,SUSTAIN - NOT! 90% OF THE SUSTAIN OF THE INSTRUMENTS WIPED OUT FOR CLARITY - reminds me of the old Dolby NR days (not that it sounds like Dolby NR, but you probably get where I'm coming from)........<br /><br />NOT THE BEST DRUM MIX, VOLUME-BALANCE/DYNAMIC RANGE OF ALL RUSH ALBUMS.......Neil wanted no part of handling this remix (and it shows)....down 1.5 on the kick drums (less brightness), up 1.5 on the high-hat, up 2 on the snare, up 1.5 on the toms, up 2.5 on the cymbals (I know, easy for me to say - armchair engineer)<br /><br />Specifics: On Ceiling Unlimited, Alex's guitar got totally neutered on \\"if laughter is a straw for a drowning man...\\" (play the original)<br /><br />Conclusion: An interesting moment in a stellar career for Rush..............I highly doubt a 3rd revision would be even considered to bring some of the \\"oomph\\" back. I applaud David B. for his efforts, as some crafty work was done......perhaps the recording and engineering was soooooo jacked-up even he couldn't salvage everything for everyone's liking.<br /><br />That's How It Is.....how it's going to be<br /><br />Oh well, I'll live
B005LAIIMG|3.0|How can You make a PG-13 movie about zombies ? World war Z that's how . The movie starts almost like Dawn of the Dead , fast , racing to get away . Theres really no characters other than Pitts Gerry and His family. The movie moves fast , action scene every 10 minutes. Its ok , but for hard -core zombie fans will be disappointed. I saw it on a loan , but don't know if I will buy it .
B0038ZITIE|1.0|I bought this movie, knowing it would be bad, for my monthly &#34;bad movie night&#34;with the friends. I figured this would make for a pretty epic installment of bad movie night, but it was beyond bad. Just campy in the first degree. Nothing made sense, the plot was stupendously absurd, and the acting made me throw up inside my skull cavity. People actually left bad movie night. It was so bad that despite being late at night, I had to stay up for another 3 hours to watch &#34;heat&#34;, so I could wash the putrid taste out of my mouth with a good movie. I would only recommend this movie to correctional facilities in countries that don't have law protecting inmates against cruel and unusual punishment.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|Good movie to have home. You can see it with all your family jsnf mmmm mmm jjjj desde jjj km

Eating good tasting food is a significant part of a good life.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I type all my school notes on my kindle and now I can finally print them out right from my kindle. The app finds my printer automatically. Best app for printing
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I can't wait every day to log in and Play,my daily tournaments along with my daily slots.  Very fun and entertaining.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Of course 11 is better than 10 with more refinements to the SS.  But I actually liked the simplicity of this one better than the next model.  Solid device with feel of quality - for a toy. Good noises and light. Kids are going as Dr. Who(s) for Halloween - one as 11 and the other as 10.  Wife are not sure any one will even recognize them but my daughter just laughs in that &#34;Oh aren't my parents just old and funny&#34; kind of manner.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I've been trying to read this book for years. I usually start then forget to finish. I'm glad I finally got around to reading the whole thing. This book is captivating from beginning to end. A tale about government secrets that keeps you on the edge of your seat like a thrilling movie. Well done Dan Brown, we'll done.
B00FEN000S|1.0|,,, but it's just a really, really terrible film.  The underlying idea at the root of the movie is totally cool, ie  there's a interworld breach at the bottom of the Pacific Ocewan that gigantic monsters called Kaiju are coming through to attack cities along the Pacific Rim and mankind has responded by building gigantic fighting machines called Jaegers to destroy them.  How cool is that?  And some of the visual effects and imaging are really cool as well.  But throw all that out the window with a hopelessly predictable plot and some really terrible, god-awful acting and you end up with just a stinker of a movie.<br /><br />I loved Charlie Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy, he perfectly plays the too wise for his years, brash, in your face, motorcycle gang punk, Jax Teller.  But he's EXACTLY the same in this movie, and this role doesn't call for it.  Sorry Charile, you've demonstrated that as an actor, you are as one-dimensional as a pin prick.  And speaking of one dimensional actors, Ron Perlman is another one.  He was fine in SOA, but when he showed up as the Kaiju organ collecting black marketeer in Pacific Rim, I laughed out loud at the absurdity of that casting decision.  Bad enough you got Jax Teller narrating most of the movie, now you got Clay Morrow too.  And then there's Maku, the love interest - another one-dimensional waste of film.  Add in two just too whacky scientists - for comic relief, apparently - in the research department and the mysterious Marshall played by some clown who apparently made up a heretofore unknown accent - in which he shouts out such corny, memorable lines like, \\"Don't you know the world's coming to an end?  Would you rather die here or in a Jaeger?!\\" - and you've got just a screeching, smoking train wreck of a movie.<br /><br />Which is just a shame.  It's s stunning film visually and there is a kernel of a really cool idea there.  You can pretty up a pile of crap all you want, though, but in the end, it's still a pile of crap.<br /><br />This is a really bad movie.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Of course nothing compare's to seeing it in IMAX 3D, but as a huge Star Trek fan, this second J.J. Abrams installment of the franchise exceeded my expectations.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I had a chance to view the series on Netflix since it was offered. I enjoyed it so much, I had to own it.<br /><br />And waiting for the second season and beyond.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|I never write these reviews but  I'm making an exception here because the book is sooo good. I'm not going to write about the plot or other stuff either. You can read that with the semi-pro reviewers that troll this website. It was a great book. Difficult to start at first, but well worth it. For the first time in a long time I had to pay attention to what was going on, so many books I've read lately are just the same old thing with different characters and planet systems ect. This is far different and requires a bit more concentration than the usual stuff, but, well worth it.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Products arrived were genuine apple manufacture. Good quality, same as what comes with the power adapter. Buy 2, they're small.
B000OLV97I|5.0|I think this movie is very entertaining for young and old alike. It has action and a good story. I have enjoyed the series of books and thought the movie was just as good.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|Besides the fact it took well over a month to get this in the mail from the date I ordered it, it does NOT hold a charge very long. This is my 3rd swivel sweeper (I ordered the other two directly from swivelsweeper.com) and I never had any problems with my last 2. The first one last several years and the second one I accidently broke. They both held a charge. I could use the other two several times in several rooms before having to charge it again. I have been using this one from Amazon for over 2 months, almost daily. I have to charge this one as soon as I'm done using it on my kitchen floor because, the battery is dying which, is not a way huge area. I don't know if I just got a bad one. I know it's not the battery because, I've been using my battery from my last one to see if it is the battery that came with it but, the swivel sweeper still doesn't hold a charge long. Now I have to spend more money on another one. I'm not happy about that at all.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|great app, use  shazam with shake app, this way when i hear tune just move phone and shazam kicks in pretty quick
1926667131|5.0|Completely met my expectations, lots of tips and exercises to gain control of your thoughts and your overall mental and physical atitude.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|used it right away, easy interface, straight forward.  Don't like how it puts down its website in title to each pic, but can be edited after the fact
0767812166|5.0|If you haven't seen this story I would recommend not quite star wars but a good story wished they made a II
B009MCRHH6|4.0|difficulty level rises quickly - fun game - still playing it after a few weeks and that says something as i bore easy
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|This was as close to a perfect Judge Dredd movie as can be imagined.  Pacing, action, acting were all high quality.  This is what an action movie should be.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|Very high sound quality, especially for the price. It is a fantastic mic for gigs or for many applications. If you want a good vocal mic for recording, I would splurge a little bit and get something a bit better though.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case is simple, no extra weight, the easel works like it should and I don't have to worry about setting the Kindle down on any surface when it is in its case
B001DHXT6G|5.0|All 3 years of the original.  Can't beat it.  It looks great with their sprucing up of a 40 year old tv series, but it is the one that started it all!!  You''ll  want Scotty to beam you aboard for all 3 years!!!1
B00915G6MG|5.0|The DVDs arrived in perfect condition. They were on time, if not early. The price was great too.<br /> I have had no trouble getting any of the seasons yet.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Great plot and storyline, plus RDJr is awesome! This has it all comedy, action, suspense heartbreak... I need four more...
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The movie was exciting, and the sound and cinematography were excellent. It was much better than I had anticipated it to be.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book, I really enjoy the way you get a glimpse into these ladies lives. I can't bring my self to put the book down.
B000X5SPBI|3.0|This product came earlier than expected which is cool ,i like the fast service , the box and disc was near mint but there's one problem i got season 3 of all the discs except for disc 3, in other words season 3 disc 3 was replace with season 2 disc 3 and the rest were season 3,so be careful before purchasing anything used
B004EF65QA|5.0|I really enjoy British tv/period pieces - really liked this show - kind of wished it had more episodes to watch where the characters went to next!  If you enjoy British you will enjoy this!
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I liked the snow and the puzzles are fun great game to keep you thinking  I enjoy playing it with my husband
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works great on Original Kindle Fire.  Gave me options for the printer we have.  Was very easy to set up, took about 1 minute.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Can not put it down, from waking in the morning to bedtime. I even take it to work to play during breaks. I hope they keep going with the game and continue to make more and more New stuff. I have to leave now, but, taking the game with me to the bath.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really love this device, this is something I have been looking for.  It is easy to install though sometimes difficult to transfer from android device to t.v. but that is probably my fault. I am 79 y/o and was able to connect it to my t.v. successfully.<br />[[ASIN:B00DR0PDNE Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player]] I have been telling everyone I know about the device.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Amazing acting from everyone and shows the ugly reality of incest and HIV for everyone to see.  A must see
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Really easy to use. Diablo-like is a good description. Definitely good for passing the time. I haven't gotten to the later levels and can't comment on the need to pay but so far so good. It is definitely worth the download.
034580404X|5.0|THIS SERIES IS PHENOMINAL!!!!!! MUST read!! Each book gets better and better. I recommend to women everywhere and you can bring new stuff the the bedroom ;-)
B0014JLYS8|3.0|Like the shoes but too big my other work shoes are size 11 so are these but I guess I needed to order size 10
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It is the best game ever.If u are thinking about buying it u totally should.It is so much fun.I play it all the time
B000UVT3OI|5.0|So very pleased with this wonderful CD and DVD.  Was surprised to see a musical DVD added with 2 discs of all music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just watched my next episode and can not wait until I have the time for the rest. Two more before having to wait for the next season to start..oh my!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is a book that I actually borrowed from my library but I do plan on flat out buying the book. You know going into the book what the end result is but I still could not stop my self from wishing it all ended differently. I honestly think this should be mandatory reading in school. It just goes to show how what you do, big or small, how it can effect someone's life. I was in tears for most of the book. I have recommended this book to others and will continue to. Jay Asher thank you so much for writing this book.
1476727651|3.0|A different sensibility than its predecessor &#34;The Shining&#34;.  When you read, read it with fresh eyes and not to compare the two.  Danny Torrance's role is back as the main character.  So is Tony (eventually), with peppered appearances throughout of many of  the remnants and spectres of the Overlook Hotel.  A good read, but not so much about madness and possession than it is about redemption, and good against evil.  I see a possible trilogy (???).
0316044695|1.0|When I read this book, I was surprised that none of the reviews came from Viet-Nam era SEAL's. I soon discovered why. He not only ran out on a wounded shipmate, he let this poor guy fall ALIVE into the hands of the ragheads. Later in his story he claims to have been able to have taken out a prime target but chose to save his own neck instead. Maybe this form of conduct is acceptable with someone in a regular ground unit, but within the old special warfare community it would never have been tolerated. There are other blunders that these guys pulled which may have lost them their lives. He also tries to make some events during his fleeing from the enemy seem God ordained. Good Greif.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book is 1984's successor. The author has brilliantly crafted a vision of North Korea, that is far more insidious than anything you could imagine. Read it.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|I was never much of a fan for listening to jazz.  However, once I downloaded this app, I find it so relaxing to listen to.  What a variety of different selections of jazz music to choose from.  Love this app!!
B001POX73C|5.0|I loved this book.  At the beginning I thought it would be hard to follow--too many names & titles.  But the story eventually sorts everyone out.  The characters were silly and pompous, but one quickly comes to like several of them, and I couldn't wait to find out how it ended.  Lots of giggles along the way.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's an ok app so I would get it if I were u. Fun to play if u get really board
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I believe successful women often isolate themselves. Even when they are doing all the can to support and help other women succeed, it can still be lonely at the top.The book provides great perspective on being at the top of really large organizations.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Love this movie Chris Pines is adorable. Great action and special effect and i needed it to finish my collection.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|More people need to watch this too much chemicals are used in this process. Looking foward to Gasland II coming out. Thank heaven some states have put on hold.
0803738412|5.0|Great story and beautiful illustrations. Perfect as a small pre-Halloween gift. I enjoyed it just as much as my son.
B00005JPLW|1.0|I bought this 2 disk set as a gift for my husband. He and I both love the movie, but the 1st disc in this vendor's set (not Amazon) did not work. The only solution offered by Amazon was to send the faulty disk set back and then re-order the movie. I would've, but the price went up. Oh well....will try to get it from another vendor.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My son is 6 1/2 months and we started using this at about 5 1/2 months. The first few times I put him in it, he just dangled there sort of confused and we had to put a thick blanket under his feet so he could reach the ground. But once he caught on that he could jump up and down, he LOVED it. He loves all the little toys and wheels and things to grab at, and we can put him in this to jump for easily 20+ minutes at a time (obviously supervised, but still let's you fold laundry or do other chores within sight). I don't know how long he will love this, but if he enjoys it another month or two, I think we got our money's worth.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|Trapped is right!  Constantly needing hints becomes so cumbersome that I typically put this game down. The graphics are pleasant.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|1st I am not being paid to write this as so many companies are now doing.  This book is an easy read.  I think it drags on a bit though and I lost interest.  I didn't read the entire book but I am pretty sure I figured out what the outcome was going to be.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Trying to find the right holster for my camera and overwhelmed by the priciest ones, the experience with the Case Logic brand of good quality inclined me for this one. I don't regret my decision.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|This film fills in the missing pieces of information if you haven't read the books.  A glimpse into the soul of the characters
B00EKJWS1Q|1.0|When I try to install the app I get an error stating that the app is corrupted and cannot be installed
B008602KQI|4.0|The movies is great. However, I would have liked to see more scenes of the actual hunger games in the movie.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Solid stuff! Very engaging. Extremely well-written. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. The best of it's kind ,maybe ever.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|This is a great game. I play a couple levels every night. I love these type games and hope i can find more like this .they are fun and addictive. I really like it.havent finished it yet
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Note even good for a simple action flick.  Parts felt cheap.  The one liners wren't all that good.  Not worth the time.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Season 8 never happened,<br />Season 8 never happened,<br />Season 8 never happened!!!!<br /><br />For your own good, don't watch the Series Finale! I am NOT exaggerating when I tell you that the ending LITERALLY left me in a state of depression for weeks. I felt so depressed and betrayed by the show's writers and producers!<br /><br />I'm still NOT OVER IT!!!!!!!<br /><br />The promos for season 8 were better than season 8. THE PROMOS!!!!
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|I was not able to access any instructions to play the game and I was unable to play the game like I could on my laptop. I didn't care for it at all. I am going to try it a few more times and more than likely delete it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  Have been playing it for quite some time now.  The color is great. It is easy to play and will keep you playing  for hours.  It is addicting.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I am a happy player. Great game. Great graphics. I' m glad I have 2 kindle fires cause now I can play along side my grandson when he visits. For some reason he seems to be a better player.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is the best game ever since the game came out<br />Talking about amazing Spider-Man yeah the best game ounce again
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well I'm waiting on season 4 to come out, I will be ready every time, its on , kick back and relax
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Enjoyed it. I love Bones! And I even got my little brother and dad hooked on it.  It came on time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got this game for my grandchildren to play.  Two of them (ages 7 and 5) both enjoyed playing.  they enjoy watching the movie, when they visit me..
B0053O89IS|5.0|A great season of course.  Came before expected!  Awesome! Now I just need to get season 8 and I will have them all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love these books! Easy reading with depth. Don't miss reading this love story because of the stigma attached to this series.
B00E4Q6Y3I|1.0|This is another re-release of an older recording (2003?). When I reviewed that version, I commented at length on horrible staging, an awful tenor, a barely adequate soprano and a splendid baritone. Plus there are substantial cuts to the score. I have not changed my mind.<br /><br />Jose Cura is a good actor here, but his vocal technique is painful to experience: glottal attacks and forced head tones as low as E natural make for unpleasant listening.<br /><br />I have heard Mme Villaroel when the music she was singing was in sync with the voice. Leonora is not a good vehicle for her. See her in Verdi's Jerusalem on TDK for a fine performance.<br /><br />I cannot say enough bad things about the staging, so I won't, other than to reiterate that it is another horrible example of \\"Eurotrash\\", whch, based on some recent Met performances, has made it \\"over the water, sad to say.<br /><br />Fortunately for opera lovers, the Met HD performance with Radvanovsky, Alvarez and Hvorostovsky is splendidly presented in nearly complete and propery staged form. Get that one gentle reader; this one will spoil milk!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Soooo...these guys. What an album. It's a good listen through and through, then over and over again. Which I know because that's what I'm doing. There still aren't many &#34;rockin&#34; songs as in their earlier days, and they're still going with the slower pace, but it's the refinement that's changed. There still are some upbeat get your toes a tappin tunes, and enough ebbs and flows in the album to wonder what the next track is gonne be like. Each song even brings their own surprises. I'm a fan though and I'm biased. Don't care, they're awesome and the albums great.
1568363931|5.0|This book has amazing easy to follow recipes, and a good variety of dishes. Great for the beginner who wants something more varied than many of the other bento books.
B000060P79|4.0|Good CD.. A lot of the songs I can relate to.. &#34;I'd do anything&#34; is my favorite song followed by &#34;Worst Day Ever.&#34;
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't turn the pages fast enough!! Can't wait to read more by this author. The last chapter was an added bonus.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|The characters and story lines are fantastic. You won't be able to just watch one episode. It's both funny and entertaining!
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|Tried to watch in HD and standard definition, kept getting a bandwidth warning and  only audio was being streamed for both HD and standard. Ended up watching using another streaming service which worked just fine.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|50 shades darker the second book was a quick easy read. Getting the book on kindle made it easy and quick.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Upon reading some reviews about the Chromecast after ordering it I was nervous that it would not do everything I had wanted from it.  The main concern was that the product information I could find indicated that it would only play video files off of the cloud or through services such as NetFlix.  My main reason for ordering this product was so that I could stream locally hosted video files off of my computer and onto my tv without using cables.  Luckily, after doing a quick online search, I learned that it will play video files stored on your computer in several different formats.  By installing  a Google Chromecast browser extension, playing your own video files is as easy as dragging them from desktop or file folder into the chrome browser.  So far I have used MP4 files.  Avi files do not work with the chrome browser and must be converted.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First of all, I knew going into this that it probably wouldn't work in Canada. But for the price and a little VPN it's a pretty good buy.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Nice read, an entertaining ending for the saga.  Will have you guessing on what will happen and how the conflict ends.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Lots of fun. Goes fast and is quite easy to navigate.  Keeps the old mind active. Would recommend to anyone.
0156027321|4.0|Piscine Molitoir Patel was his name. He was a skinny indian vegetarian boy who believed in 3 religions(Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam) . He lived in Pondicherry and his family owned a zoo in which he lived in.  This book is a very interesting read and really had me turning every page from the beginning. I think that it is a bit gruesome at times such as when they constantly described in great detail how Pi caught, killed, and prepared the animals that he ate. I think that the peak of this gruesomeness was when Pi apparently met a another castaway while he was blind and the castaway ended up being eaten by Richard Parker and Pi even admitted to having a morsel of the mans skin. Overall though Life Of Pi was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who is slightly religious or is interested in philosophy.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|Watched it for free on a flight, thankfully I was able to cancel my bluray purchase shorty after. I buy mediocre movies but this was bad, im not even sure if you removed the absurd accents that it would have helped.
B008Y212PI|2.0|I've had fun playing this game since I got it. It's just challenging enough to not be overly frustrating and still be fun at the same time.<br /><br />Edit -- At the time I wrote this I wrote strictly on gameplay.  After reviewing the permissions this game requires I cannot give this app 5 stars any longer.  There is no reason to need network location or access to personal data.  It really is too bad so many of these apps are requiring this and Google needs to make developers more responsible and as culpable for requesting them.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put it down until I finished it!  I always wondered what happened to Danny! Great writing Mr. King, as usual.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Christina Baker Kline's book is a wonderful read that moves seamlessly between 1929 and 2011. I loved how Vivienne's past and future intermingle so well with Molly's present. I am a big fan of historical fiction and love learning about a period of American history that I never knew. The Orphan Train provides history and pulls the reader into a beautiful story. I have already bought another book by this author!
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I liked this band for a while...but I did not love them... until now... The heavy hard hitting riffs and solos... and not too over done on vocals.<br /><br />A must have.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I enjoyed this book....not sure why it was controversial.  It's an easy to read telling of a story that interests me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I usually watch a show once, but Downton is so good, I have watched several of the episodes twice. I can't wait to see future seasons of the saga. Great show!!!
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|Love how slim and well fitting this case is on my phone. I took my otterbox off and replaced it with this case. It's a lot less bulky and fits better in my pocket. I think my phone is still well protected from a fall with this case on. I love the bright color and the cool colorful stickers that came with it to put on your home screen button!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great read by Grisham. Did not see it coming and was totally confused at the end. Been a fan for a long time and will look forward to the next book. I think I have read them all.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS SERIES SO FAR....IT HAS KEPT ME SPELLBOUND.  NEVER REALIZED WHAT A GREAT ACTRESS  CLARE DANES IS.  I DO NOT REMEMBER SEEING HER IN ANY THING ELSE, BUT SHE IS TERRIFIC IN THIS.<br /><br />CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2 TO ARRIVE
B008M87GJK|5.0|Fox news are the only news I watch or hear bbc always being my favorite.they always tell you the truth without running around the Bush . And Fox because is the only anti religion that never criticize our faith. But this app has been real good
1476727651|5.0|Some books should not have sequels and I thought The Shining was one of them.  I was wrong!.  Dr. Sleep brings Danny Torrance back to life after The Overlook Hotel burns down and he's safe from his father but not from his personal demons that come in a bottle of booze.<br /><br />The adult Danny's travels take him to a small town in New England where he gets a job at a tourist spot as a caretaker and is guided into AA to sober up.  In the off season he finds a job in a rambling old Victorian home that is currently serving as a Hospice.  Pulling a story from the real news King has given him a cat that knows when a resident is ready to pass over and will go to the room of the elderly patient.  This is the signal for Danny Torrance, known to the staff and residents as Dr. Sleep, to go into the room to comfort and assist in the final moments of passing.<br /><br />In another story line a little girl named Abra Stone is born with the Shining and can foresee disasters. It soon become apparent that Abra's Shining may be more powerful than Danny's.<br /><br />The reader then meets the True Knot, a traveling band of psychic leeches who feed on misery, pain and tragedy.  They travel in a harmless looking caravan of RV's to events such as the Twin Towers heartbreak on 9/11 to feed.  The group is led by the rapacious Rose the Hat.  Between the big events they prey on children in the most shocking and appalling ways imaginable.<br /><br />The blending of these three story lines gives us another disturbing yet fascinating tale from the master of this genre.
B0084QWB0O|5.0|Much respect to my Navy cousins, sad story sorry it had to happen.  Can't wait for the film to come out.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This was a great build and nice memory for me.  My Kids really enjoyed it and are having fun playing with it!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I love having the ability to create word docs on my Kindle! a must have for school and work project!
B000YDCFRE|4.0|Typically i wear a 9.5 or a 10, it was my understanding that these boots typically run a half-size large, so I ordered a 9.5. I wish I had ordered a 9.
1451648537|4.0|Ordered this book for vacation reading. Was shipped and received in plenty of time. Will order titles additional very soon. The book is fascinating, many unknowns.....
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The DVDs come in handy folders that smack of Government work, and make it easy to organize and find the DVDs you want.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I loved that this show took real emotions and showed them properly.  Everything in it felt like incidents that would actually happen.  No over dramatization, no cheesy quirks.  it was as if I were watching a snippet of this town's life.  I am excited to see how Season 2 goes.
B00EXVZZE8|3.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! Best nyan ever! Except, it glitches sooooo much! I had to delete it because the music was shilling playing when I turned my Kindle off!!
B003VXMMTK|4.0|Just wish there was more on the series.  This story sucks you in and leaves you wanting for more. Excellent!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved reading all 5 in the series. The story is exciting and humorous. I can't wait to get home each night and start reading.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Love this app for when i am on the go and am wanting to watch movies or show on my media server.
1451627289|5.0|Great gift idea for Stephen King buffs...a big book with a big story...worth adding to your own book collection as well.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|This show is literally the best show I have ever seen on television. It is an emotional roller coaster! Definitely a must see!!!!
B005AVIZ6U|2.0|Not relly happy about this - Lee Child seems to have &#34;Lost it&#34;.<br />I have read and enjoyed him up to now - this one is terrible.<br />Poor character building, almost no story, needs a complete<br />re-write I feel
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Get ready! Hold tight to your kindle! Oh, and make sure you are standing up. This game has lots of twists and turns. Great foe all ages, but if you're over forty like myself, it may take you a few tryst to get into it.
B005Z6YHEY|4.0|Everyone should read this type of book now and then.<br />A very interesting topic with some excellent passages on the issues
B003ZMF26W|5.0|So, I was looking for a gaming mouse with these criteria:<br /><br />- Sensor is laser based<br />- More than 3 buttons<br />- Claw grip<br />- LED lighting<br />- DPI adjustable<br /><br />And, well, I stumbled upon this mouse. It was fairly priced for the advertised characteristics of the mouse.<br />I got everything I wanted in my list above, and more. A CD was provided with the package for macros, but I couldn't install it because there was a problem with my drive. (That's no problem though).<br /><br />The mouse fit my hand nearly perfectly, the left-sided buttons (fwd/backward buttons, I'll call them) are easily accessible by the thumb by either applying pressure at the end of the thumb or at the thumb's bend. (Does that make sense?) The other buttons I'll find a use for later.<br /><br />There's a few modes to the lighting as well, the button below the DPI buttons will: turn on/off the lighting that comes out of the grill from the front of the mouse, or make the cm logo pulse slowly. The button itself will turn green when some of these are activated.<br /><br />Also, it occupies my ring finger fairly well with some adjustment to the positioning of the palm.<br /><br />It's heavy enough to feel sturdy, and the look is slick!
0761169253|5.0|Deep concepts explained in an easy to understand way. Very motivational for an art student like myself, would make a great gift.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|If youre having trouble comprehending what exactly the subconscious mind is, this book can help a great deal.  It's well-written, fascinating, and gives great examples of how the subconscious mind works.  For ninety-nine cents you can't go wrong.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is amazing you should totally get this app even if your not sure you want it it is free
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My family loves this series.  The stories revolve around wonderful characters.  The lessons are wholesome and moral.<br />It's charming and funny.  I wish more shows were like this.  I like it better than Downton Abbey.  It's not so glitzy, over the top, but you will love the characters.
B000F3T3CS|4.0|For reasons that I cannot fully explain, I love Donizetti and I especially love L'Elisir, which I have seen on several occasions at quality opera houses.  I really, really love Netrebko, whom I saw at the Maryinsky in St. Peterburg (Don Giovanni), one of the high points of my life.  I like this production of L'Elisir, but the sound on my DVD has a tendency to recede at a few points, especially with the bass voices.  I have tried to fiddle with it, to no avail.  Not to worry, though.  An entertaining production, with an excellent cast.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Terrific show. It's going to be hard waiting for the next season. I have become part of the Downton staff.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This show has just the right amount of family drama and romantic glow.  I like the mother and how she injects her life and experience into that of her son's and daughter in law's.  This show is VERY similar to Downtown Abbey, which I absolutely love, so I'm enjoying this series, as well.
B00BF11UM0|4.0|Not as cool as I thought it would be, but it's far better than &#34;Seal Team Six,&#34; and it shows &#34;Homeland&#34; to be the erratic piece of drama queen trailer trash that it is.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|Not going to give you cinematic results, but is an upgrade over handheld and some other models I've used. Good for tight spaces, hard to pack with other equipment. Clunky on its own.
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|I like Matthew McConaughey and have enjoyed many of the movies he's been in, but this one did nothing for me.  Like anything else, it's a matter of opinion and someone else might like it, but I found it incredibly slow and boring, until almost the end when it finally picked up a bit.  When the two young boys in the film were talking, I could barely understand what they were saying because they spoke very fast and with regional accents.  I stuck it out til the bitter end because, hey, I paid for it, and I kept hoping it would get better, but it never really did.  For me, it was a waste of $5.
B00FJ30OD6|5.0|Please, review the product, not the delivery.  There is a chance that your computer is at fault and what we all look for is how is the drama, how do you like the show, the performances, the storyline, not whether your computer worked with it!  It is unfair to TGW to give it one star because your volume didn't work.  My opinion of the show is that it is excellent, been looking so forward to it, and was not disappointed!  It is very rare that one program is so consistently enjoyable.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book has helped open my eyes to the inequality our society deals with.  As a young white male, I believe deeply  an even playing field for all, but know men like myself have benefited for years from bias treatment.  This treatment is really a disservice to all because much more can be achieved with the right people in the right roles, regardless of their gender.<br /><br />This book does a great job of illustrating the change needed in society to even the playing field, and better things for us all.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this book a 5 star rating is because at times the opinions are stated as fact. The book should also do a better job of high-lighting that career growth should be based strictly merit instead of gender.
B003O86FMW|5.0|That was the first word that came to mind with this book.  By the time I finished the book I could not wait to get the third book!!
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|The acting of Bronson and Fonda was something to see and admire.<br />The whole movie was Great, but watching these two actors was somethng to be admired and respected.
B003B02O14|4.0|Loved it all, except the ending, though it was a great twist!  But I was hooked all the way to the end--Grisham did a great job of parceling out just enough information to keep the reader engaged but not enough to really know what exactly was going on.  If you like Grisham's other legal thrillers, then you will like this one too!
0374158460|1.0|The sing songy phrase from 'In Living Color' runs through my brain every time I think about this book. Hated it (oh snap).<br />Why am I so hostile?  Because it's frigging long and full of unbelievable daytime soap opera shenanigans. Why did I read it?  It was all the hype----I felt it my responsibility to put in the hard labor in the hopes of getting brownie points in Literacy Heaven.  I had forgotten my own advice; start every book with an open mind, but if it fails to grab and transport you in a decent amount of time, ditch it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|A FIRST TIME EVER TO PLAY WITH people I  KNOW.  SO FAR I in the game. this day Oct 3!2013.<br />t
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This one is quite a bit like Mario Brothers.  My six year old especially loves it.  It's so cool to watch him play it.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I love the Christmas Carol and wanted to read the original story.  I was not disappointed.  I constantly compared it to the various movie versions I own.  They are all different and wonderful it their own way.  The book is timeless.
B0052OSTOS|4.0|It is versatile. You can choose the length of the meditation and the background sound. Also the blend between the sound and voice. Good choices, but be prepared to fiddle with them the first time to get it all  just the way you prefer it. I liked it because I wanted a guided meditation that would help me to relax my body from head to foo, and this does.it.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|I bought this thinking I would be able to access the Candy Crush Saga game on my Kindle.  But, that hasn't happened.  I keep getting the message, &#34;not available &#34;. What's up with that?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm a senior citizen .Sometimes, I remember, sometimes, I Don't. This game helps to keep my mind sharp and focused.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|This movie was down right a waste of time. What a load of garbage to portray our president as this capable, hip, and caring president. Propaganda garbage! It is sad that our culture enjoys films like this when the reality of the state our country is in is one that the founding fathers would be ashamed of. If you want to to watch a good film go watch \\"The Patriot\\", \\"Glory\\", or \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and get some perspective about what Americans used to value.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|So enthralled by the suspense that I was encouraged to purchase a sequel the plot was good and the twist as well
B000G6R7B8|4.0|this is a very good price for an excellent basic watch.  The color goes with anything I wear and the band is comfortable in hot or cold weather.  Luminosity is very good.  I have more expensive watches that don't have both date and day of week.  Good job Seiko.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Ordered 4 bulbs. Working great.  Very, very bright bulb, so it is good for a room that you need a lot of light in.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|Just got my copy of virtuoso guitarist Al DiMeola's new release \\"All Your Life.\\"<br />Al's tribute to the Beatles, playing compositions by Lennon/McCartney, shows his abilities as an arranger as well as being one of the greatest guitarist in the world.<br />Al uses a plethora of acoustic guitars on this beautiful CD and brings his legendary chops to an artistic display of taste and passion.<br />If you are a fan of the Beatles songs, and masterful guitar playing, then this CD is a must have!
B002SCF6CA|4.0|Funny, good dialog and decent special affects make this a very watchable movie. Danny Divito steals several scenes but that's OK because it is obvious that The stars work well together
B0027MJU00|4.0|I found it hard to form a releationship with Libby. I felt sorry for her and could see that she had aright to be angry but.....something was missing and I'm not sure what. Maybe her callousness is what kept me reading through to the end. Glad I did. All questions were answered.
B00DW3GFCY|5.0|Hollywood could not make this movie today. They would have to bash the US too much but this movie does a great job of showing both the US ineptitude before the attack and both the brilliance and flaws in the Japanese plan
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible the way it's wrote is very easy to read and understand. This Holy Bible should sale well for sure.
B00B52F278|5.0|history tells us what's going to happen but they did a nice job of closing the series, i'm going to miss it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OH MY GOSH!!!!!!! this is so fun. I love minion beach. Also I really love el machos lair. ITS AWESOME
B004L03B3S|3.0|Not that realistic. Directing could be improved. If you want something to watch, then this works. Story line is &#34; flimsy &#34; at best.
0142501123|5.0|Room on the Broom was recommended by Amazon after I reviewed [[ASIN:0064431835 The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything]], which is also a terrific Halloween-themed children's book. Room on the Broom is not in the same vein as The Little Old Lady, but is equivalent in fun. In likening Room on the Broom to another well-known children's holiday-themed book, the poetic 'Twas the Night before Christmas is the first to come to mind--not done in the same verse, but done as memorable holiday story poem.<br /><br />Room on the Broom starts with the appearance of a typical witch-inspired Halloween story for kids, but quickly develops into a hilarious stand-off between the witch's newly found friends and a hungry dragon. With rhyming verse throughout, the tale is sure to please the youngest of readers.<br /><br />For the beginner reader, there are some unusual words to fit the poetic rhythm of the story, but nothing that can't be helped along by willing parents.<br /><br />As an aside, for any dragon lovers with this book, I also recommend the extremely fun [[ASIN:0803736800 Dragons Love Tacos]].
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I am disappointed that the pocket clip only latches on one end, the quality of the tips appear to be good band I like the option of different sizes but the pocket clip should latch on either end to avoid loosing the stylus.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|LOVE it BEST phone application EVER. WHEN you're AT the Dr office with the wife with hrs to spare angry bird's is the way to go.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I love Angelina Jolie and I've watched all of her movies. Loved this one because it's a true story and as always Angelina brings it home with her incredible acting ability.
0316204366|5.0|Gladwell is the narrator for his own book and has a great speaking style. I pre-ordered the audiobook on Audible.com and listened to the whole book. The book is a clear winner - I love it! Especially I would advise anybody to get the audio version if possible, whether CD or audible, since Gladwell is doing all the talking.<br /><br />Gladwell hit many of my nerves in this book, making me understand issues that felt too uncomfortable to confront. He taught me that many winners had learned to try harder using what they had, and in the process made themselves formidable foes. None of his examples were easy. The girls on the basketball team had to get in great physical shape and challenge convention. All his examples showed that it's never easy to be \\"disagreeable\\" by going against what is expected.<br /><br />An interesting set of topics in this book has to do with education. I feel that it would be a spoiler if a reviewer revealed what Gladwell discovered about class size, ivy league universities and grades. Let's just say he's upsetting the status quo and will probably soon be the target of sophisticated and well-funded criticism. With this book and its narration, he won my heart.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I loved the homages to previous Star Trek movies and TV episodes of various vintages.  Liked the three format option.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Smart, fast paced, fun. I love it!!!!<br />The plots twists nicely, characters are developed so well.<br />I love all sherlock shows :)
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great music, all his wonderful hits!  A good collection piece.  Can't go wrong with The Dance.  I love this CD!
0399255370|5.0|Both  the story and art are captivating and imaginative! A must book for any child whom loves to draw! The giver might even use a crayon to &#34;dedicate&#34; the book to the recipient!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I have read 2 of Dan Brown's books and I am always happy with the storyline. I am going to read the next Robert Langdon book as well. The story always makes you question every day things as well as grasping your imagination for a page turning book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The actors are very good, the scenery is beautiful. You see the personal side of the war and how even the upper class was affected by the needs of the country. You gain an understanding of the class system in England at the time and how people began to make changes.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Good movie, not too violent with an easy plot to follow.  Would be a good sequel. Looking forward to getting RED II.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I read many King novels as a young adult and was excited to read this too.  It doesn't have the fear factor of It but it was fulfilling. To catch up with Dan and his family!
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|Shipment was fast and the item was in great condition- brand new with the plastic still on.<br />Great way to catch up on the series in time for the final season!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This adapter charges perfectly and it is relatively compact and quite stylish (for a charger). I strongly recommend it, especially since it can charge both an iPad and an iPhone at the same time.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book. Sad parts but characters were believable and anyone could relate to them. I like happy endings and this story really delivered.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Well, this is a yarn from which Hollywood seems able to spin endless stories... Dude does bad things in Guatemala (What, not China or Russia?! Oh yeah, we never attacked them..) And as he becomes vice President, old colleagues from Guatemala start being popped off. Enter our bunch of gnarled old wood. They won't stand for it, ergo - mayhem ensues. Malkovich is fun as the paranoid with a drug-fried brain, Bruce is.. well.. Bruce.. Morgan Freeman is .. well... Morgan Freeman. Mary-Louise Parker is no spring-chicken anymore, but her romance with 89 year old Willis still stretches credibility and becomes alittle silly. I like her though! The Crowning glory, as always, is Helen Mirren, who could act circles around all of them, and plays in a by turns big (what dialogue..!) and understated role. This will easily while away an evening for you, and you'll have fun watching it. No lasting impressions, though.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Music was totally not what I expected!  Should have been more suited tunes for that era in my opinion.  Acting had to be carried by Leo, but the storyline was good.
159562015X|2.0|After reading the book and taking the test, I felt like I had just read my horoscope.  I already knew most of the things it said about me.  It may have had some tips about what &#34;types&#34; work well together, but beyond that I did not feel any more enlightened by this test.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Excellent movie.  Worth every penny.  Shows you how you can make the best of even the worst situations in life.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Keeps track of your Kindle files that take away important space. For instance, junk files (folders) and cookies. Nevertheless, this aplication is very &quot;respectful&quot; in therms of asking and sugesting solutions (which files to delete right away or those who might be filled with important info) so YOU always have control over what you decide to erase :D
B00C2IF9SQ|5.0|It's not so often I recommend books to people but I read one recently that was phenomenal. \\"Off Balance\\" by Dominique Moceanu is the best memoir I have ever read. While I did not know very much about the author outside of her gymnastics career I was blown away by the sincerity of her book. Moceanu's writing about her experience as a gymnast and about her personal life is honest and perhaps, at times, even brutally so. This book lacks the usual fluff I have come to expect from memoirs which usually portray past events through rose-colored glasses and which typically expound only on the good events while the bad experiences are glossed over or omitted completely. This is not at all the case with Moceanu's book and instead we are shown the darkness which existed outside the spotlight and many long-kept secrets are revealed, even those which were once kept from Moceanu herself. In many ways this book represents the antithesis of what the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" and the 1996 Olympic Games represented to me so many years ago but instead offers an honest reconciliation of those events as they truly happened. I appreciate the courage it must have taken to write this book.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|Got this for my little sister, who collects them. She was very excited. We are still looking for the others.
B00006AW2L|5.0|Great early Stones album!  This album was one of my very favorites when I was growing up.  Still sounds as fresh today as it did back in '66.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and easy to play even for my 85 yr old Mom on her kindle.  Just right for a travel game.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|This Double CD of Sting was a great addition to my collection. I highly recommend it to any Sting fan.
B000006YXV|4.0|What a great performer, this was one of his better CD, I ordered another one of his CDs, I love his songs. Shipped on time, good packaging, thank you
B00E9P959O|3.0|All there were in this remixed version were subtle differences. I couldn't tell the difference from the original recording. But it will stay in my collection.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|John Green does it every time. He hooks you really good, reels you in and he makes reading his work so wonderful. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone. It would be a great  present!
B007THA4FI|1.0|If you like to read about the worst of humankind in a part of England then this is the book for you, not that I always want Pollyanna type books but I could not stand to subject myself to one more horrible character
B004MC8CA2|5.0|not hard unless you are like me and even the simplest thing is hard when buttons do not always work for you. Works great on kindle fire plus lots of versons and langages if you mess a round like me.  GOD loves goats yes you too
B008C20TDG|4.0|This book was very informative.  I have Celiac Disease and so I decided to do the &#34;Autoimmune Whole 30 Diet&#34; for 30 days.  I am on day 23.  I have lost about 8 and 1/2 pounds and my stomach feels a lot better.  My only problem with this program is that I really don't have very many vegetables that I like and the auto-immune diet excludes some of those that I do like so it's very hard for me to find veggies to fill up my plate every day.  I did find Melissa's recipe for Cauliflower Soup and that is actually good.  So I do eat that like once a day.  My cravings for chocolate and Mexican food have not given up but I haven't given in to them either so I feel pretty good about that.  I do feel like I could eat this way for the rest of my life, because I'm full between meals and it's a lot healthier.  But honestly, I can't wait to incorporate tomatoes and at least some cheese back into my life.  I feel like once I can add back some nightshades that opens up a lot more vegetable dishes that I can make so can continue eating this way.  I like eating foods with out all the extra sugar so I will keep that up.  But I'm definitely having some chocolate ice cream on day 31!  :)
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|This is a good point and click game. I just bought it so hope it stays fun. When I read other reviews I didn't know if I would like it or not. Guess you never know till you try it yourself.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Awesome U can use one in the house as well as your vehicle, works great, couldn't ask for better performance.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Still no el macho and not many opportunities to earn coin, price of coin crazy and never give full amount of free daily coins. Game is fun but makers are shady, beware!
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|This is great pool game. One of the best pool games I have played. This was a great download and its free.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|It was a let down. The reader is expecting a grand reunion, and is instead left wanting. It was a disappointment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it's awsome I can play this game so much it's just awesome just love it
B005MMJ84K|3.0|It's okay is about as much praise as I can give it. It wasn't nearly as enticing as the first book, but it was fine.
B004G6009U|5.0|GREAT retelling of Rapunzel...Disneyfied but still good. It took me awhile to see this as I figured that it would destroy the original story.  It is more like a &#34;based on&#34; but many of the original elements survived the transition to this movie. I do not buy many DBDs but I bought this one-the day after i saw it for the first time.  Grandchildren need this!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|It was an interesting and unique take on a classical boy meets girl tale. It was a page turner. If only the next two installment could have lived up to the first.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Loving the classic movie, like most people do, I wasn't interested in seeing this when it first came out.  One evening my wife and I found ourselves in the mood to see what this was really like, and were surprised by what a good time we had with it.  It's gorgeous to look at, and the story turns out to be a pretty clever take off on the story we all know so well.<br /><br />James Franco - He does well enough in the lead role, but I did keep wishing Oz was at least something like the character so well known from the 1930's film.  There's virtually no relationship between the two, mostly due to the casting of Franco.  The earlier you just accept that you're not going to recognize the Oz you know, the better time you'll have.

B00338QENI|5.0|I am into biology so the store was absolutely riveting. Even without my interest in biology, the people are written well and the story flows - this was a &#34;can't put it down&#34; book for me. My 13 year old son even found it interesting and relevant to his studies.

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|So someone help me get this straight--I'm playing catch-up here.  So, Pendergast has a wife but she was killed in Africa by a lion.  But she's alive again because, oh wait, it was actually her twin, a sister that we didn't know about, who was killed by a lion trained by Nazi's to only drag her body away--not to eat it. But before she is \\"killed\\" the first time she gives birth to a son, then later we find out it wasn't one son but twins!  One good son and one bad one. Then, she dies once more--yes, by Nazis again.  Meanwhile, Pendergast's ward, a 19 year old beauty--no hold on--she's a actually a 180 year old beauty who killed her own child (fathered by Pendergast's evil brother, Diogenes) by throwing it overboard off the QE2, has just been released from a mental hospital.  No, I almost forgot.  Her child isn't really dead but is being taken care of by Tibetan monks who believe he is the next incarnation of the Dalai Lama!  Then, Pendergast is forced to kill his demented ubber-kid son who is a serial killer in NYC.  No, actually the bad son is not really dead yet, just horribly disfigured and mad as hell.  But Pendergast does keep his good son to be educated by his 180 year-old ward, Constance, who is just now starting to age.  So, in future books (ugh), could we see good brother, bad brother, grow up to be another Aloysius and Diogenes? Corrie becomes the new D'Agosta and Constance becomes the girlfriend of good son but is killed by bad son, but wait, she's really still alive and . . .<br /><br />Oh how I miss the stand-alones like Riptide, Ice Limit and A Still Life with Crows!

B004TPJMLA|5.0|I have always love song from Paul Simon. This one is no different. I was so glad I can find old CD on Amazon and also being new. I like to played this CD to relax me.
1878424319|5.0|Very helpful, informative book which also requires a lot of self-reflection.  This is probably one of a few books that will help change my perception of many things.  Along with the personal challenges presented with the agreements, it was helpful that Don Miguel Ruiz wrote that we will not always &#34;master&#34; one of the agreements.  We cannot be perfect at all the agreements every day.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I did buy this CD for me boyfriend. He really liked most of the songs on this CD. Then he played some of the songs for a few friends and they wanted the CD also. He told them we bought it on Amazon.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Love the Good Wife. Great show that holds attention and interest!  Great story lines and pertinent to today's political issues.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Loved it what a great ending. Would watch it again and again.  Would tell everyone to watch this movie  great
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Great game, good graphics.  Wish was longer, but overall was interesting and entertaining to play.  I kept coming back to play the game whenever I had free time
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise... I was told by a friend I'd like this... Surprise... wonderful book... you have to be 70 to join the military... that is the start... oh wow...

B00ARF93AQ|5.0|This movie was much better that I expected... I was thinking of the old &#34;Judge Dredd&#34;... not even close... this movie is rather dark... much more action... WARNING: rather graphic....
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This can  is great much better than Dragonstory in my opinion but I am not here to talk about dragon story. This can has so many exotic dragon it is insane this game is completely playable without buying gems or coins and it is super fun. Considering that I have  100,000 coins and I h<br />Just started a couple  of days ago that is pretty awesome. Another great game BackFlip Studios!!!
0321934318|3.0|Good guide for using Lightroom to process your pictures and a very basic guide to using the file management features of Lightroom, so basic as to be worthless in this area. If you bought Lightroom to take the pictures you took and make prints as a much less expensive option than Photoshop the Kelby book is not bad. Kelby has gotten into studio photography in recent years and it shows in the examples provided in the book. If you do portrait photography that is very good. If you do sports or nature or wildlife or travel or landscape photography this book is not going to be all that useful.<br /><br />Very brief mention of setting up a library and making collections and using keywords so if the plan is to organize all your pictures for personal or professional reasons this is not the book to get. If backups are important and the goal is to do this while using Lightroom this book is not the one to get. Good book if you have been using Lightroom for years and want to learn about the new tools included in version 5.<br /><br />Having spent the past week with this book I would not recommend it to others that are starting out with Lightroom for the first time.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|It's much like Jack's other albums...relaxing and spectacular, with hints of his funky little grooves that get your feet moving! Get it, you will be satisfied...again!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love this series.  And I love it even more now that I have watched it again.  I could watch over and over again.
1439152810|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books. My favorite is still her first novel --  &#34;The Forgotten Garden.&#34; Morton's books are always a good read.

1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed this a lot because I believe in Heaven with all my heart, and I enjoy reading the various glimpse of Heaven books like Todd Burpo's. This one was intriguing because a neurosurgeon experienced it, so he has lots of credibility. I enjoyed the first half of the book but then it seemed he was trying to fill the book up. Also as a Christian I was disappointed not to hear any reference to Jesus, and to me if Jesus isn't there, it ain't Heaven! Still an interesting read.
B00EP22QKG|4.0|It's often said that young people don't believe they will die. Strictly speaking, this is untrue. Of course they know it intellectually, but there is something to the argument that (barring some personal event that drives the point home), by and large, they don't feel it in their bones. Mortality doesn't impinge on their moment to moment world view. I know it didn't impinge on mine. When young musicians write or sing about death, they are likely do so playfully (Jim Morrison) or indulgently (Jagger/Richards \\"Paint it Black\\").<br /><br />A change often happens in middle age. Their references turn retrospective and thoughtful, not playful. Frank Sinatra released the album \\"September of My Years\\" in 1965, the year he turned 50. At age 49, Peggy Lee had her last big hit with \\"Is That All There Is?\\" At age 56, Bob Dylan released \\"Time Out of Mind,\\" which included the melancholic refrain, \\"It's not dark yet, but it's getting there\\" on the \\"Not Dark Yet\\" track.<br /><br />This shift in perspective is very evident in the 55 y.o. Joan Jett's \\"Unvarnished.\\" Joan always has favored simple, no-frills, back-to-basics rock-and-roll. For those of us who like that sound, her albums are reliably good. \\"Unvarnished\\" is very very good. There isn't a bad or dreary track on it, a rare feat for any artist. Yet, running through her lyrics are a reflective tone and an awareness of time, most manifestly in \\"Hard to Grow Up.\\" \\"I think about my own mortality\\" is actually a lyric in the track \\"Fragile.\\" The album ends with the whisper, \\"Life and death/the change to rearrange/life and death.\\"<br /><br />I'm probably making the album sound like a downer, but it isn't at all. It rocks. Joan's current perspective simply adds a layer of richness, just as it did for Frank, Peggy, and Bob before her. If you've ever liked Joan Jett, you'll almost surely like this album, too. Recommended.
1781162646|4.0|I'm a Stephen King fan from way back to his first novels. And I read everything he writes. Gotta say, Joyland wasn't the best of the lot. It was a fun, light little read but not as....satisfying...as most King novels.  Not a waste of money but The Shining it's not.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was about 4th grade when I saw the shining. I read the book about a year later. This story was like walking down the street of your old home town. With new, scary neighbors.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I have enjoyed NCIS for years and have only recently started purchasing the DVDs of each season. Thank you so very, very much for offering each season so reasonably.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Love this.  Always works as expected and never fails to wake me up.  I recommend this over any stock alarm app.  Keep up the great work!
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Amazing action sequences, especially the train scene at the start and obviously, the climax. Acting isn't the best but works for the movie.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream Theater Does it Again With this Masterpiece, A Little Different from Their Last one, Some are complaining about the sound..I think its Great Expecially When you pop the 5.1 Surround Disk in..Very good!! Songs are great Nothing Dissapointing about this Cd
B000000OQG|5.0|I bought this cassette to replace my orrignal copy of Appetite for Destruction.  This was the first music cassette I ever purchased as a kid and it brought back such great memories.  I probably wore the old one out I played it so many times.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants by Malcolm Gladwell<br /><br />\\"David and Goliath\\" is an interesting yet somewhat disappointing book about what happens when ordinary people confront giants. Best-selling author, Malcolm Gladwell provides many examples that range from the compelling to the dare I say feeble. That being said, the book is stimulating and it's never boring, it just lacked the brilliance that a book like his very own \\"Outliers\\" has. This provocative 320-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. The Advantages of Disadvantages (and Disadvantages of Advantages), 2. The Theory of Desirable Difficulty, and 3. The Limits of Power.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Always engaging, provocative and a page turner. Gladwell is a gifted narrator.<br />2. Interesting subject, never boring. You never know what you are going to get from Gladwell. A great premise and title for a book, \\"David and Goliath\\".<br />3. Gladwell explores two main ideas through stories and keen observations. \\"What we consider valuable in our world arises out of these kinds of lopsided conflicts, because the act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty. And second, that we consistently get these kinds of conflicts wrong.\\"<br />4. A recurring theme that resonates throughout the book, \\"There is an important lesson in that for battles with all kinds of giants. The powerful and the strong are not always what they seem.\\"<br />5. I absolutely loved the story of Vivek Ranadive's basketball team and where Pitino's trademark strategy came from. \\"The whole Redwood City philosophy was based on a willingness to try harder than anyone else.\\"<br />6. The provocative discussion on the correlation of class sizes and educational success. Interesting angles (the concept of the inverted-U curve) and great water cooler material regardless on which side you fall on.<br />7. The concept of it is better to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond than a Little Fish in a Big Pond. \\"The phenomenon of relative deprivation applied to education is called--appropriately enough--the `Big Fish-Little Pond Effect.' The more elite an educational institution is, the worse students feel about their own academic abilities.\\" Interesting findings that resulted from this observation.<br />8. An interesting look at dyslexia. \\"Dyslexia is a problem in the way people hear and manipulate sounds.\\" This is where Gladwell goes into his theory of \\"desirable difficulties\\" and provides many examples of stories of success and overcoming challenges. The case of trial lawyer David Boies is one of overcoming the odds and making the most of his challenges.<br />9. Measuring personality through the Five Factor Model (\\"Big Five\\").<br />10. I enjoy historical references and this book offers a couple of intriguing stories. The \\"London Blitz\\".<br />11. Gladwell loves patterns and he has made it a trademark to share some of his favorites. \\"Twelve of the first forty-four U.S. presidents--beginning with George Washington and going all the way up to Barack Obama--lost their fathers while they were young.\\"<br />12. A fascinating medical case study involving Jay Freireich and leukemia.<br />13. Case studies involving courage. The American civil rights movement. The fascinating story behind the iconic photograph (calm teenage boy being attacked by a snarling German shepherd) that captured the impetus of the historical movement.<br />14. The use of trickery, the art of survival and triumph even in the most hostile of environments.<br />15. The incendiary case study of Northern Ireland. \\"In Northern Ireland, the British made a simple mistake. They fell into the trap of believing that because they had resources, weapons, soldiers, and experience that dwarfed those of the insurgent elements that they were trying to contain, it did not matter what the people of Northern Ireland thought of them.\\"<br />16. The principal of legitimacy. \\"Legitimacy is based on three things. First of all, the people who are asked to obey authority have to feel like they have a voice--that if they speak up, they will be heard. Second, the law has to be predictable. There has to be a reasonable expectation that the rules tomorrow are going to be roughly the same as the rules today. And third, the authority has to be fair. It can't treat one group differently from another.\\"<br />17. The uplifting case of Jaffe and J-RIPpers.<br />18. The inception of the Three Strike rule and its shortcomings. \\"Clearly, then, there's a big difference between having no penalties for breaking the law and having some penalties--just as there's a big difference between a class of forty students and a class of twenty-five. On the left side of the inverted-U curve, interventions make a difference.\\"<br />19. Understanding the limits of power. The case study of the Huguenots.<br />20. Notes linked.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No links to original sources.<br />2. No formal bibliography.<br />3. Lacks scientific rigor or depth. Gladwell mainly presents his side of the story and at times suffers from confirmation bias. It's ok to present opposing scientific views while defending your own.<br />4. I really have a tough time buying the notion that people succeed because of their difficulties, \\"The second, more intriguing, possibility is that they succeeded, in part, because of their disorder--that they learned something in their struggle that proved to be of enormous advantage.\\" I look at it as overcoming challenges, making the best of what you have.<br />5. Some of the case studies are not for the faint of heart. The Candace Derksen story was particularly painful and difficult to read.<br />6. A misspell in the table of contents.<br /><br />In summary, Gladwell's books are always provocative and fun to read. The biggest problem for Gladwell is to live up to expectations set by a book of the caliber of \\"Outliers\\" and frankly whether fair or not this book doesn't live up to it. It lacks panache and most importantly scientific rigor. That being said this book has moments of radiance and he always manages to entertain. Perhaps 3 stars is a bit low but rest assured all of Gladwell's books are worth reading. In short, this book will provide great water cooler material, read it and make your own call.<br /><br />Further recommendations: \\"[[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers: The Story of Success]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]]\\", and \\"[[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]\\" by the same author, \\"[[ASIN:1594484805 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]]\\" by Daniel H.

B000SEGTI0|5.0|I read this years ago, before the Bladerunner movie, and the paperback is dog-eared and needs to go.<br />Thanks for the e-version!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Lots of fun and great replay value. The levels get tough but not impossible. Great logic<br />puzzles I find myself playing again and again.
B003WUYQSW|5.0|I love books like this that make me feel a little less crazy for having the brain that I do. I've been an entrepreneur my whole life mentally , but I allowed everyone around me to tell me &#34;it's not possible.&#34; No longer- 25 years is long enough! Thanks to Gary V. And so many other entrepreneurs who are crushing it, I've been inspired to crush it on my own fronts. The time is now! Thanks for the awesome books, Gary. I can't wait for JJJRH!<br /><br />-Sarah South
B00F91RYL8|4.0|The movie follows the book in a way that it covers a vast space and shows how different areas are handling the epidemic.  It does well in that it doesn't try to recreate the book and takes a more personal story.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|What can I say about this movie, but awesome.  All of Alex Kendrick's movies are good.  Anyone who has not been saved should watch this movie.  Your faith will be restore!!!!
B002NOH7G6|5.0|amazing movie, i bought the disc because to me it is one of those rare movies which I want to watch again after every 6 months or so, haven't seen the extras yet but i'm sure they can't be anything but cherry on top
B004WR125O|4.0|It worked as advertised.  Decided to set up manually to connect to WiFi.  &lt;5 minutes later jamming with 88% signal strength.  Saw quite a few complaints about signal strength being an issue.  My router is on floor 2 and my receiver is on floor 1.  Perhaps a few of my Amazon peers need to step up to the next internet tier and a new router set up.  Will update in a month or so once I've used all of the available features but so far so good.  Onkyo HT-RC360 and Onkyo Android app for RAZR Maxx.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really got wrapped up in it!  Will order more of Moriarty's books. Twists to the story that keep you picking it up.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I am so glad that I downloaded this app! The puzzles range from kind of easy to difficult. I had never played a game this this before but now I'm hooked!
B000FC10MU|2.0|Story jumped around too much. There were so many characters, I think over 21, with foreign names so I found it very difficult to keep track. The author lists all the names and countries characters are from in the front of book which may be helpful to readers.
0007453574|5.0|good<br />good at text<br />illustration<br />fantastic<br />lovely<br />i havent read it yet<br />but i love the style<br />and the writer
B000PXUA5W|5.0|My grandson loves Legos and he loves his watch.  It's educational and fun.  He's into soccer, too.<br />The perfect gift for a six to seven year old.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Bought it for the grandchildren.  Kept them entertained for hours. Had to schedule turns to keep them from fighting over it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I got this game a couple days ago and I cannot stop playing it.  I would highly recommend getting this game.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The children loved it and played with it the rest of the day. They still play with it days later so I guess they still like it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A great game to play to keep busy. Very addictive and very fun. I've been stuck playing from when I bought it
B0053O89JM|5.0|A great show with a great supporting cast.  Who could help falling in love with Cudy?  Wilson has to be the most loyal friend ever...even though he got House arrested.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I used this to boost the volume of my Samsung TV to my sound system and it has worked perfectly. The amplifier is small, light and is provided with all the necessary cables. If you need more volume on devices using headphone jack connections, then this is the product for you.
0767919408|5.0|One of my favorite authors.  Mr. Bryson always has a great (read) on all topics.  This is the year my dad was born, so, am looking forward to his take on 1927.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really really enjoyed this story as it was full of turns and twists.  I was intrigued by the characters and their secrets.  It was always a surprise to find out what was happening and how the events connected all of the characters.
B0056369RO|3.0|Should always think twice when searching out and deciding to buy music you're not 100% sure about. Would have rethought this one
B0089LOG02|3.0|The characters are well developed.  The settings interesting and believable, although some historical details could have been better researched.  The theme of self-interested and hard hearted foster and adoptive parents (especially mothers),  is so repetitive and harsh, it makes one wonder whether the the author has an embittered adoption experience or simply is trying to build empathy for children left without families.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Enjoyed listening a copy so had to get my own copy. Ryan Lewis & Macklemore will have a hard time topping it
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Nicely done as usual love all of them.This one has to be the best one yet. highly recommend this movie
B000XXTCF8|4.0|Not sure why I didn't have this before.  All the classic hits from Van Morrison everyone should own in their collection
0061122416|5.0|I read this book once, then turned right around and read again to absorb the message further.  Fanatastic.  I can see why this is Will Smith's favorite book.  So inspiring.
B001O03NCW|4.0|My family and I enjoyed this movie and it is a classic.  The music of this soundtrack is good for all ages
B00E9P959O|4.0|When Vapor Trails was released in 2002 I was very pleased with the album. I consider myself in the minority of Rush fans in that I really like the content of the album as it was originally released. I think that the songs bring an energy that most other Rush albums do not have. I liken Vapor Trails to Led Zeppelin's Presence. Both albums were made under difficult circumstances and both albums were markedly different from the rest of their respective catalogs.<br /><br />Rush and Bottrill hit it out of the park with this remixed version! The songs have a whole new dynamic to them. I believe that if Vapor Trails were released with this mix the initial release would have been more successful. As it stands the original did have a rawness to it that in my opinion did work on a couple of the songs, the title track and Secret Touch in particular. This remix however really makes the album shine.
B001DCQI82|3.0|This is a fabulous definitive collection but some of the discs won't play so I'll need to return it for refund or to get a set that does work.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I loved this movie, great acting, amazing script, and very relateable. Love is love! All the actors in the film were commited to their roles, and you will defenitely be drawn into the character's lifes.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun game you don't really have to think about. A great way to just relax. Enjoy it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best science fiction books I've ever read!  I just finished re-reading it now that the rest of the story has been published!  It was just as good the second time.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Awesome game, mechanics and timing take a bit getting used to. Can get pricey but totally worth it for the time of game play you get out of it.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|We should all read stories like this one so this time is not forgotten, well written and so true to her life.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I love the show. I received the product promptly and in great condition. I give it 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchae.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like the size of this - we take it camping to keep knives sharp. Works well, small and packable.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this backpack a couple of years ago when I just had a small DSLR with a 50mm lens, my original intentions where to use it until I upgraded to bigger and better gear and then switch to a bigger backpack, but as time has progressed my gear has changed, I have purchased many accessories and still I haven't found a reason to change my camera bag. I love it!<br /><br />It might seem small but it can hold up really well. I have carried a Canon 5D Mark II w/ 50mm Zeiss lens attached, Nikon D7000 w/ lensbaby, an old Medium Format Camera, 3 extra lenses and set of filters without a problem. It is really convenient how you can set up the distribution inside the backpack according to your needs. The material is great, and in my case has never been ripped or broken, despite the fact that I have pretty much dropped this bag everywhere (beach, river, mountains, street, desert, etc.).<br /><br />As a woman (or as a human being), I really appreciate how the back and shoulder straps are padded. it is really comfortable to carry around, even when you put quite some weight into it. The front pocket is great to put on your wallet and a few personal belongings, or in my case camera manuals, chargers and cables. And the side pockets are great to fit a bottle of water (I bet they where not intended for that!)<br /><br />Anyways, if there was something that I would improve in the product it would be to make a bigger version to carry around a 15\\" or 17\\" laptop, if in the near future I decide to switch to another backpack that would be the reason why. But so far it has exceeded all of my expectations in a good way, highly recommended! If you are looking for a camera bag that's good and won't dive deep in your pockets, this is a great option!
0345472322|3.0|This book is good for those who have an interest in actually reading it and for those who require it for class and have no choice. Although being said, the book is actually set at an affordable price. I would say in the end if you are debating weather or not buying this book, just go ahead and purchase it and it won't break the bank list of textbooks. I gave it an okay rating, because I didn't really have a choice when purchasing this book since it was one of my requirements for my Psych class. The actual content of the book is great for those who are in interested in the subject and learning more.
B005LAIGPA|3.0|It was an okay movie, I would watch it again but my interest in it was that my son worked on the set and his name is on the credits as the Sound Assistance.<br />:)
1400052181|5.0|I love the imagery and the book is so moving and at times you have to put it down and it all gets too much. I would buy this book again and read it all over. This is really a great book. As I rated this book, I love it. I would recommend this book to anyone to read.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I've followed Bruce with all the die hard movies and have watched over and over and I would watch them again.<br />He doesn't let me down, if he did another one I would watch that one too and I would love it.<br />I always recomment it to everyone I know, including you!!:D
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Entertaining joss wheedon series. Not as much in love with it as some of my friends are but it is a fun watch.
B00B52FDXQ|3.0|I bought and followed all the seasons and I was hoping they would have a final ending of peace and a little happiness, instead all of my favorite characters ended.<br />I wasn't to sure about the new Spartacus after Andy but he did really good in the War of the Damned.<br />Sigh, can't bring them back.<br />I'll mention it to others but I don't know that I would encourage them, it's very graphic and I would want them to want it on their own.<br />Sigh, The End!
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I have enjoyed this CD so very much.  I bought this for my son but have enjoyed it so much myself too.
0802473156|5.0|Amazing!  Must read for all couples,  married or not.  In fact, relationships on all levels can benefit from this eye-opening book.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|Played on a Kindle Fire.  I had read the reviews and saw that in Jan and Feb 2013 there were technical issues.  It's Oct 2, so I figured that a responsible company would have ironed them out long ago.  During play you are constantly rebooted, it does bring you back to the current area of play but so....... annoying.  Also you may have to repeat your last find.  I would have given the game a strong 4 bordering on 5, due to the unique hidden object game.  I normally dislike HO games but this is a new twist on it and everything that you find helps you go further in the game.  Please fix the game.  I really liked it, and Ive come to expect so much more from it company.  This shouldn't be.  I see you have a sequel to the game but I'm going to have to wait until you fix the errors.  See how we think when we come across problems like this, we won't even go check out your other games
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I think this one is better than the first one. I liked it too!  I think it will be interesting to see what they do in the future with Khan. The cast is perfect, they really got the right people for the right characters. It is very well shot and the special effects are good.
1569242739|4.0|Tried a couple of the cupcake recipes and they were good.<br />Nothing to shout about though.  Probably need to get used to the different flavors of ingredients..
B00EEXPDTM|3.0|Not really well written or acted.  I did learn a bit about Linda Lovelace but the film did not live up to the hype I read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun and slightly addicting, but in order to get most of the different characters you have to have a lot of the &quot;Gru coins&quot; which are difficult to come by or expensive. Other than that, this is a fantastic game for children and adults of all ages.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I set this<br />alarm to my own music and I love the gradual sound this app uses.  I it 5*****. thanks
B004UID2LC|1.0|it does not upload at all I got so made and almost smashed my device so mad at the greater who designed this app MicroMacro Mobile Inc.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|But the dvd - especially the Blu-ray - could use some more extras. Still, it's an excellent film and worth having.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I choose to make this review to tell other that this dictionary is a very good dictionary for young kids in a Good school.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|I finished the book, barely. I'd purchased this and another at the same time. Not even interested in starting the other. Gillian Flynn is off my reading list.
0345410025|5.0|this book has the potential of changing the way you look at things on a daily basis.<br />not to meantion how it is easy and enjoible to read.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is so much fun and easy to play! And it actually has a useful tutorial to teach you how to play. My only complaint is the ads for other games that pop up frequently.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|DOes the job and does it well.  Only wish that it took a transformer for power instead of it running out of juice and then having to plug it into my PC to recharge.  I guess I can buy a charger with the right adapter to keep it plugged in all the time while it is being used.  Otherwise, exactly what is needed and works well.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm clock and prefer it over my cell phone as it has a slow increase of sound.  This is a great solution!
B000002O3I|5.0|After watching the movie Cadillac Records, I had to have this cd by Howlin Wolf. I listen to it while I'm reading or just relaxing. This is a great cd. Thank You for sending it to me.
B00B8M4IMK|2.0|I purchased this charger to charge both Apple and Android devices.<br /><br />Pros: Build quality is very nice<br /><br />Cons: It didn't work with my car. The metal nub on the end was too short to touch the inside of the receptacle, so you had to jam it in to get it to start charging. In turn, the plastic on the charger got mangled and scratched by the inside of the receptacle. Eventually it would wiggle free and lose the connection, but since there is no charge indicator light on the charger itself, I didn't know if the charger was actually charging or not.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I am a jigsaw puzzle addicted. I am so glad I found this one. I like being able to choose how many pieces you want. My 4 year old grandson likes playing the game also.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|i wish the show would never end! A great family show to watch over and over again. Never a dull moment.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|This is a decent movie, but there is something lacking in the story that keeps it from being great.  It's a special effects movie, so for that it's good.  But the story just doesn't make it.  Obviously a comic book based movie, and it comes off that way.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Daft Punk is not for everyone.  Some people say their music is somewhat repetitive and there is some truth to that criticism.  But if you like techno, you should like this CD a lot.<br /><br />I like the solid bass and find the melodies enjoyable.  I can't stop playing this CD.  I'll be very surprised if this doesn't become known as one of the best CDs released this year.  Give this one a listen, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I wish that I could stream video's and everything that is on my computer with Chromcast. Let's home that more is added in the future.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is such a cool game and its so much fun yeah! !!!!!!! buy it now you will have a blast :)
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Bruno Mars is so awesome and I'm definitely a fan for life now! Funk, R&B, Pop, and Rock. A man after my own eclectic heart!  Satisfies all parts of the genres of music I love!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great game. You can play it for days and not get bored or finish it. When you play it again it still keeps your interest.
B004XQO90O|3.0|This is so far fetched and too repetitive.  Not enough differences exist in each scenario to keep this movie going.  Not worth your time.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Pretty good app. Much needed for writing and editing papers on the go. College student with a kindle fire. Thumbs up
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Darcy is a character you love to hate, although I think the author was trying to make us love her by the end, I just couldn't do it.  She was still very selfish.  Enjoyable book though.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|The combo pack of Titanic is nothing more than a collector's item for fans who collect and reminisce a beautiful memory of a past reality. The Blu-ray version of the movie is graphically more improved than the the DVD. The digital copy is even convenient for iPad and iPhone is you like watching movies on your portable devices.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|One word to describe it &quot;entertaining&quot; always something to do I can't complain at all download right now. Before it's too late lol
B007QHKM76|5.0|Stones Grow Her Name is particularly a special album in Sonata Arctica's discography, it is however still a respected album considered the effort and sincerity put into it present in all of the songs.
B00C2IPB66|3.0|I'm not going to review the movie because most of us have already seen it. Regarding this BD edition, it's plenty of extra material and comes with the theatrical and extended edition, which is great. No complains. Now, regarding the package, it could have been better. From the outside it looks great as most steelbooks. But once you open it, there's not a single picture. Completely blank. This is dissapointing. They could have put a little more effort on it. That's why I rated it with 3 stars. But if you don't care much about it, buy it.
B002E2M3KM|5.0|News of the World is arguably one of the best albums Queen has ever recorded. It features great hits like &#34;We Will Rock You&#34; and &#34;We Are the Champions.&#34; The majority of the album contains a much slower sound than other Queen songs and albums. Each song has a distinctive and unique feeling as its own story and universe.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Can't...stop...playing! Love the star wars theme still of course, and background imagery is great. This is nothing but a good time.
B001E2PTJA|5.0|The Who by Numbers marks the continuing excellence of The Who. The album is rather similar and contains no distinctive musical influence and sound than its predecessors. The entire album comprises hard rock sounds and pop-like styles.
B0091X2K0A|1.0|As I told you before, I could not see it as it would not down load. It seems the only way I can get to view a movie from you people is if I pay for it. Your prime stuff does not work!!!!
B000UX4D5K|5.0|Disraeli Gears follows the similar style as it's predecessor. Disraeli Gears features hit single &#34;Sunshine of Your Love&#34; which has perpetuated in the decades followed the break-up of Cream. The album has a significant influence on the rock bands followed in their wake.
B003MOHX8S|4.0|The epitome of epic trailer music, short and very intense. It's all very good stuff however I did find myself wishing that there were some tracks with a slower build. Most are only around 3 minutes and sometimes it feels like it's over too quick.
B0012HEB32|5.0|The TV Show of Terminator is most certainly more deep and anxious compare with Terminator trilogy. Everything is a lot more episodic than the movie, but very similar to that of the movie.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|does not work. I can not use facebook. It won't work on my Kindle. Was it ever sent to my Kindle?
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|If you wants to understand how the lights work, it's the right book. A lot of tips and beautiful images and a clearly text help me to understand how I'll use the light.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I love this version of this classic! Great movie what else can you say about it...If you like classics, get this one!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The lineup of actors in this installment of the Expendables was amazing. I have seen some of these actors in movies for ages and just seeing them in this action plix was unbelievable. Definitely recommend.
B0098HGNGG|5.0|This the best photography StuffIt that i bought!!! It's help me to take the best aperture and correct exposure! Now I don't need more try and error the exposures!! I don't wats more time!!
B001O3CWY4|5.0|Exquisite vocals as always from Diana Krall, the music is first rate. She does a fantastic job of interpreting the  lyrics. Smoky emotional jazzy songs that are very listenable. Pure excellence!
B00000G3PA|5.0|I bought this as a gift. Made it in great time and it was in great condition. Exactly what I wanted. Thank you.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I have always been a Trekie. That said this is a very well made movie though the ending was a little corny.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Awesome music great vocals.Nice change from all the othermusic. Very glad i bought it glad avicii could finally come out with an album
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My son watches this over and over and I actually don't mind. There are a few scary parts but not nearly has bad as most Disney movies.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I am a crusty, grouchy, 60 year old male who seldom has an appetite for a child's plate but, my wife served this up and it was delicious. The villain is right up there with Cruella De Vil, the heroine is disarmingly direct, and you get your feel good at the ending.  A tight film based on a stretchy yarn by Roald Dahl where good (a child) triumphs over evil (an adult).
030745455X|5.0|This was my favorite of the trilogy and has since turned me on to so many other Swedish novels in same genre..loved it!!
0143124544|4.0|I can't say anything about this book except my wife loved it. It was fast shipping and reasonably priced. That is all I can say.
B002436WFI|5.0|I'm a Terry Pratchett fan, so I was happy to finale own a copy of this funny and well made production.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I play it most day for hours while I am getting my Infusion. I am glad I found it.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|The seller gave me what he promised: fast delivery and excellent quality.  The movie was like new, no scratches, no dirt.  I am very happy to have done business with this seller and amazon.  I am a science fiction viewer and this is a nice movie to watch specially in Winter when it is super cold so you can get a Little more concerned.  It is all good. thank you.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Really involved dystopian romance with a good deal of expected and unexpected twists and turns. A good read for cool fall days by the fire.
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|This is a cute movie, but I sometimes felt that Cary Grant was not really into his role; his acting seemed forced and not as good as it usually is in most of his movies.  The same could be said for Ms. Day's acting, although to a lesser degree.  This, especially Grant's sometime forced acting, bothered me as I watched this otherwise fairly entertaining movie.<br /><br />To the person who said they need to make more movies like this, there are a few out there if you look for them.  However, and sadly, there are not many actors around the likes of Cary Grant, Doris Day, Rock Hudson, James Stewart and Ingrid Bergman, to mention a few of the \\"good oldies\\" actors.<br /><br />The script is simple: rich older man finds himself disliking/kind of courting/taking advantage of/finally falling in love with (but not necessarily in that order) a country girl who thinks (or at least wants to prove) that she is a lot more sophisticated in regard his way of living than she really is.  Of course it ends up with several amusing incidents.<br /><br />Not one of Grant's and Day's best movies, but well worth spending the time watching anyway.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Lots of conversation and switching between screens. This is probably my least favorite BF game. I am usually sad when the game is over but I thought this one would never end. Most of the time was spent reading the very slow dialoge that the chararories were saying. All of that said I would still recommend this game even though it was too pricy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put this book down! Keeps you engaged from beginning to end! The twist in the story will knock your socks off!
1857885082|5.0|I own a copy and really enjoy reading it. As my daughter is heading to England I bought this one for her.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The first half of the book was a bit slow, but the 2nd half made up for it.<br />She really develops her characters before she puts them into action!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Work's real good on Kindle Fire, frequent updates, clean interface. l would recommend it, an app worth having, take the time and download it, keep your phone or table running smooth.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is the first book I have read in a while, and I'm very glad I did. Classic characters everyone loves in a way different perspective than the movie. Great to read to children.
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|I watched this movie 2 times and its that good, I am waiting to get ip man 1,2,3,and 4 and when I finish watching all of them then I will ship them to my son he loves karate movies too. if you cant find what your looking for go to amazon and you'll find it. thanks amazon
B002M27QQK|5.0|I really like the photography of this book and also the fact that it comes with so many plus like the paper dolls or the post cards!
B008K8U13K|5.0|Bought it for my kid and love seeing him enjoying Sonic as much as I did when I played it as a kid. Will definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sonic or any other similar games.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|this is my favorite DT album. it is great start to finish. I play it straight through at least once a week!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I have been enthralled with the entire Game of Thrones book series and was curious to compare the HBO series to the books.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the show mirrored the book.  The scenery, story locations, and the cast of characters really looked and felt like what I had pictured in my mind.  Well done!  I will be purchasing future episodes.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|This app used to be very clunky and sucked when you want to stream, but now the app is almost perfect. You can now log in, the performance is way better, and in some ways, it's better than the computer version (It just needs the chatbox... grumble grumble)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved this game, well worth the money spent! Dark, creepy, and quite tricky, can't wait for the next one to come out!
0345529057|5.0|Came quick and look awesome on the shelf, could not of asked for a better version of the books for that price!
0894803123|5.0|Great starter book with basic ice cream recipes. My kids love all the vanilla based ice creams. The chocolate ones are a little trickier. They tend to come out grainy. I made rocky road. The taste was great but the graininess was off putting. Chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla malt are the best. We just buy the pillsbury dough cut it up and freeze the pieces. Haven't tried the sorbets yet. Either way I paid 17¢ for the book so I definitely got my money's worth.
B0026S93C0|5.0|I saw this when it came out, it is still good many years later.  Jennifer Beals really makes this film with her acting.
0689835604|5.0|This was part of my grandsons first birthday presents. He lives in another state but I'm sure he loved it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun game with yourself or play with someone. The pictures are very nice all so you can play it hard or easy great for kids.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|There's not a song on this album that I don't like, and I love most of them. I'm very happy with my purchase
1878424319|5.0|I bought this book, as it was recommended by a good friend, plus I enjoy a practical 'personal development' book every so often.  What I noticed immediately was the author's writing style - it is simple and easy to follow.  Aside from it being a quick read, the knowledge contained within is truly transformational.  Without giving away too much, I can tell you that this book will make you question all of your beliefs and the origin which they came from.  It will make you reassess every decision you ever made and will give you insight into just why your life is the way it is.  At least once you'll have that A-HA! moment and realize what you need to do next.  Bottom line...buy the book.  You won't regret it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game very much!  Having 3 different levels made it easy for my kids to play and me too. My only complaint would be that I would like more pictures to play!
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|Season 5 was a little tougher to get through than the other seasons but I'm already on Season 6 and it's promising to be mug better!!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This WWII game is the best. It shows you alot of famous guns in WWII guns that where used In the hands of the enemy and the US.
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|The opening sequence is about the only action I can remember from this bomb ... and so much talking that I lost track of what was going on. Could also be that I fell asleep about 30 minutes into this snooze inducing movie.<br /><br />Watch only if you have trouble sleeping, decide there are 2 hours of your life you never want to get back, or you're looking for a new way to get rid of unwanted guests - this is the movie for you.
B005544V6A|5.0|After you get past the first episode and some of its tackiness, the show really develops its characters and relationships into something worth watching. The dialogue and situations get even more clever as the season progresses.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was really good. The ending was wonderful! Makes one count blessings for sure and makes you remember what's important in life.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This app is epic I love it 5 stars 5 star all the way there is a few things that are bad like the phone and stuff but over all the pros out away the cons so yeah get it it is FREE and also EPIC
B0060MYM3S|4.0|What can I say - I purchased this second season.  I can only say that there were too many dark scenes in the whole set.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I bought this game for my Nook and when I got my Kindle, I HAD to have it for that. I can spend hours playing this! You match up symbols on a 3D cube, rotating it with a finger swipe (some tiles are buried inside). If you like Mahjong games, you gotta have this game.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Great story. The begging is a bit slow but other than that the book is well written, the her memoir is very inspirational and invigorating! Plus we all go through the same type of journey but in different terrains.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I have tried many different weather apps and this one appears to be among the best. Just installed it but so far so good.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am in love with this book. I am in awe of Victor Hugo.  I want to start back at page one to experience this joy again.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Froze my Fire. Almost impossible to uninstall, asks constantly for reviews AND offers  FREEBIES for 5-star ratings:a practice Amazon should disallow. I bought this in conjunction with the developer's Alarm Clock app (which would nags you constantly to<br />buy this add-on) and had to uninstall both. I nearly had to reset my Kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This will allow you to stream directly to the TV.  The price is fantastic.  This allows me to stream media to a not so smart TV.
B007THA4FI|5.0|its good I think it is really good and interesting i am not done yet but i think that it is good
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great murder mystery drama that doesn't just solve the crime, but lets you in on the lives a murder effects! Also, great acting from the great David Tennant!!
B009GEFXLC|4.0|A good combination of all of the above.  Also, fairly kid appropriate (with some exceptions),<br />so the whole family can watch and enjoy it together.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Very well written, thought-provoking and intense. Love love love. Five stars all the way.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved the trilogy! Sad that there aren't more.  The first book was difficult to start...but if you stick with, it's great
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I struggled at times with this book as the jumps from characters and times were a bit confusing. But a book well worth reading and a great insite into living.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|There were times I was reading it before bed and I was laughing so loud that my kids (who were trying to sleep in their bedrooms) would complain that they couldn't get to sleep!  If you're a woman in your 50's like I am ... the chapter where Tina discusses getting her period will NOT be a chapter you want to read when others are trying to sleep! ;)
B00594XOZU|1.0|Well ! I have emailed you people and have yet to receive a response. I emailed about 5 days ago. WTF ! Nobodys that busy...And it won't even work on my kindle anymore if I could give this app a NEGATIVE ZERO I would but I cant..----______-----
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like it - I'm not the best with the computer stuff - I still have a lot to learn.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|This is one of the worst apps I have ever bought this game cheats like a mug. I'm sick of it soon as I'm done I'm uninstalling this cheat skate app.!.
B00ERDLYHY|4.0|I know this book was written before Pride and Prejudice, but I was surprised at the style differences between the two books. The characters are still great, though the insight into their motives is more obvious (especially \\"supporting players\\"). The dialogue in Sense and Sensibility is still tons of fun, but nowhere near the sparkling wit from P&P. The narrative seemed heavier and was more often used to advance the plot (instead of dialogue and \\"action\\") and it dragged the reading down a bit. To be honest, I think Emma Thompson's (cinema) rendition was a finer piece of editing than this classic written version. I saw the movie before reading the book, which may be influencing my perception, but I also had just read P&P, which probably had a greater impact.
B00190OHD6|5.0|AWEsoMe great story. Laughed cried.. Best chick flick ever.MThe acting was amazing and even the sound track was wonderful. What more could you ask for.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My grankids laughed so hard they just thought this movie was so funny.<br />Them laughing so hard made me even<br />Laugh harder...
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Pretty wordy. The story was good and some good surprises. I was really getting into it and then came to the end.<br />This is the first book I've read by this author.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Had been many years since I first read it and just as good this time. Looking forward to sycamore row
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Everyone in our group from age 6 to 56 enjoyed the movie. The beginning was slow for the 6 year old but she did get interested once they got to Oz.
B004IJY4L0|5.0|Really awesome music... I find myself jammin this album quite often. I definitely recommend this to people who enjoy drum n bass
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|I loved so much in MaddAddam, and I adore Margaret Atwood to such a great extent that I feel guilty giving it anything other than high praise. But as with Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood, the other two books in the trilogy, I never fully lost myself in the world she created.<br /><br />For one, I felt distanced by her neologisms and fictional brand names. They just didn't ring true for me-they encapsulated the ideas she was expressing but didn't feel organic to any world. For example, the strip club is called Scales and Tails. Sure, it features women dressed up like exotic birds, and some creepy snake stuff, but the name is just so intellectualized. It's not dirty or edgy. Similarly, I kept getting distracted by the spa called AnooYoo. Why the weird spelling? It can't be extrapolated organically from anything I can link to in our reality. It's like it's constructed merely to telegraph that this world is in the future. And it's a shame, because the scenes set in these locations have all the depth and drama and complexity that I expect from Atwood.<br /><br />And that leads me to a bigger criticism. Atwood has some very legitimate big ideas, and she's a brilliant and beautiful writer. I do love and adore her, and always will. But her criticism and dystopian vision seem woefully divorced from the world we live in today. The technological elements felt stuck in the early 1990s. None of her characters seemed like progeny of the digital age. This could be the result of beginning the trilogy about 10 years ago, but even so she still feels very much out of date. I'm not expecting William Gibson but I was frustrated with the missed opportunity.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'll sing her praises for the best part of the book-the complexity of the relationship between the humans and the Crakers. One of the devices in the book is that the Crakers expect a story every night, a tradition started by Snowman in book 1. Jimmy is comatose at the startof this book, so Toby (who played a prominent role in book 2), has taken over. She is trying to explain the history of the apocalypse to people who are innocent, and Atwood's prose is just exquisite. (\\"Please stop singing.\\") And I really loved the character of Zeb and how she kept his journey personal even as it connected with the very big things that were going on. And lastly, I was pleasantly surprised with how she incorporated the pigoon hybrids into the story. I wasn't expecting the story to head in that direction and it raised a lot of fascinating ideas.
B00723NWJE|3.0|I'm a professional jazz piano player - been playing since 1955. I've worked with and heard a lot of singers in my day. Norah Jones is one of my favorites. I haven't heard this album, so I can't comment on the musical content.  But, I am also a graphic designer and have been doing that since 1965.<br /><br />This album cover is one of the worst I've ever seen. The basic layout is OK, but the photo (or illustration) is not doing Norah any good. The letter-style (font) used is extremely amatuer. I can't give this album cover even one star. Why Norah approved this is beyond me... really bad stuff.<br /><br />My mother used to say \\"if you can't say something good about it, don't say anything.\\"  But, I couldn't let this one off the hook.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This book is as much about Abra Stone as it is about the aging alcoholic Danny--survivor of \\"The Shining\\". Where Dan Torrance was raised by a mother who's just as much a tosspot as her departed husband Jack (with the crucial support of Dick Halloran, late of the Overlook hotel where Jack met his end), Abra is the product of a very non-dysfunctional nuclear family whose only hangup is the \\"shining\\" that Abra shares with Dan. I'm not going to play the spoiler and blow the cover off the other bond this troubled man shares with this irrepressible teen. Suffice it to say that one thing that supports Dan is serving as Abra's \\"sort-of\\" Dick Halloran. The opportunity to get away from first-person-singular and make somebody else Number One has saved more than one person with \\"issues\\", and Abra becomes the daughter Dan never got around to having. Abra is such a strong person that she's able to protect her folks by lying that her \\"gift\\" is a passing phase once she knows that it worries them. The contrast between her and the self-destructive title character of \\"Carrie\\"--only slightly older than Abra--who'd been emotionally maimed by a religious fanatic mother, is obvious. If Abra had been in that book as a friend of Carrie's, she might have served as a counterbalance to the head-case mother and that story might not have ended in tragedy.<br /><br />But Dan and Abra have troubles of their own to face here. An ageless tribe of quasi-gypsy/ quasi carny drifters with a vampire hunger for children's souls has centered on Abra as the next young victim after she's able to draw a parallel between \\"have you seen this child\\" ads in the back of a pennysaver. It's suggested that the spectral \\"bogeyman\\" that pursued Dan as a child through the deserted corridors of the Overlook was part of this same bunch. And Abra's very existence both whets their appetites as well as making them fear her. As King ages, his work has become more and more in the way of good-versus-evil than Saturday afternoon \\"monster movie\\" scariness. The \\"bad guys\\" are ordinary humans who are born with a lot of \\"horsepower\\" for evil and the \\"good guys\\" are VERY good people who are that way because their capacity for caring has just as much \\"horsepower\\" to it.\\"monster movie\\" scariness.

B00CATSONE|2.0|I got this short book to learn more about Nikola Tesla.  What I got was a brief outline of his adult life, but nothing in depth.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|The blend of witty dialogue and action make this movie a cut above the typical comic book movie -- as well as a cut above Iron Man 2.  I understand fans of the comic book don't like how the screenwriters have changed the Mandarin character, so if you are a comic book fan just try to enjoy it on its own terms.
B00F91H666|4.0|the zombies on this movie really crazy looking but I did enjoy this and had a good story line I do recommend this to zombie movie fans
B00E9P959O|5.0|If you've read the other reviews, there's not much I can add. If you haven't . .  then I'll keep it short. I always liked Vapor Trails but the mix sounded \\"muddy\\" on the original. Thanks to a much-needed and long overdue re-mix, it now sounds like it should have the first time. If you're a Rush fan then this is a \\"must have\\". Great album . . . but then again (if you're a Rush fan) aren't they all? :-)
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|amazing documentary even if you are not a music lover. One of the better music documentaries I have ever seen.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I love the show and this package includes every episode in the series.  Picture quality is exemplary, and the sound is great.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Order &amp; Chaos is an adictive game. I started these types of games long ago with various others and this game is great and it surpassing my expectations.
B00000B9BD|5.0|This was the album that introduced me to The Strawbs, its William Blake cover art catching my attention immediately, and it remains a favorite to this day. That's not just for sentimental reasons, but because it works so well as a coherent concept album, without the straining that marred some concept albums, where some songs never truly worked as separate songs. They all work here & can be enjoyed individually as such; but together they make up something more than the mere sum of the album's parts. The concept is the path of a man's life, as much spiritually as physically, from childhood to old age ... and beyond. While some songs are obviously more powerful than others, not one is mere filler. Yes, some listeners find \\"Ah Me, Ah My\\" a bit too twee & out of place -- but for me, it fits in with both the English sense of whimsy & the light-heartedness of second childhood, as age starts creeping in, an almost desperate attempt at jollity to deny the inevitable. As for the sublime \\"Benedictus\\" & the raw, anguished title track, these are superlative songs. Yet for the all the angst & darkness of some tracks, there's still room for the lyrical & the reflective, as well. If I have any quibbles, it's (1) that the bonus tracks, while perfectly good songs in themselves, are really unnecessary here; and (2) the lyrics aren't included. If you can find an old vinyl copy, pick it up, because the sleeve & its contents are things of beauty, a wonderful example of how bands made the most of the vinyl record jacket. It's an album that straddles folk-rock & prog-rock, combining the best of both styles into a distinctive sound that has a certain timeless quality to it -- highly recommended!
B002361MLA|5.0|What an incredibly enlightened book this is! Someday schools may teach this to children. It is the greatest power that exists in us: This moment we have here right now. Eckhart Tolle is a sage-like teacher for the the modern day expounding timeless wisdom in every page. I recommend this book to anyone who feels they need something new in their life that grounds them during their most trying moments. This book is fertile with the potential to awaken consciousness at any moment. What this means for humanity is a future without the expectation that suffering is necessary to appreciate life or that thinking is required to experience pure joy.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|it had a good story plot ,& you werent shour who the grand master was . him or her. the fight seens were gerat.
0307476073|1.0|I found little worthwhile or useful about this book.  I started flipping pages 3/4 of the way through to see if it picked up, but it did not.  In it the author is totally self absorbed and dysfunctional and the subject matter uninteresting.  She hiked a shortened version of the PCT and did not even hike that with all of her many detours due to snow.  She was totally ill prepared.  What's to learn?  Almost nothing.  How this turned into a bestseller is beyond me.
B0022F1XW0|5.0|Outstanding music with Genesee classics! Phil Collins and the rest of the band play awesome music. The soundtrack of my early adult years.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great acting, great storyline holds true to the legendary cast and crew of the starship enterprise.<br />I would recommend it to friends
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|While contemporary entertainment is awash in graphic sexuality, the vast majority of it has all the emotional depth of a snickering adolescent boy immersed in Internet porn. Happily, that's not the case in this warm, very rewatchable true story of a disabled man wanting to experience sex before his death, and the sexual surrogate who helps him to discover the pleasures & joys of his body. But what's really impressive is how the film avoids the other potential danger of such a film -- being so noble & high-minded that it becomes ethereal, losing the necessary carnality of sex. Everything is just right here, presented with good humor, tenderness, and a refreshing matter-of-factness that never becomes too clinical & detached. Helen Hunt richly deserved her Oscar nomination, but lead John Hawkes was just as deserving & should have been nominated as well. And William Macy, as the compassionate priest who obviously cares more about the spirit than the letter of the law, provides solid support. In fact all the supporting characters add to the story -- but it's essentially a two-character drama, one that thankfully never becomes too dramatic. It feels like real life, and it deals with sex in a truly adult manner, exploring both the emotional & physical needs of human beings. It touches on loneliness, on the need for intimacy on all levels, and celebrates the lush satisfactions of the flesh. These are real bodies of real people, both vulnerable & resilient, not insanely sculpted & exaggerated cartoons. And as real people, they have complex feelings, which are also revealed in all their contradictory & wonderful aspects. If only more films had this much maturity -- enthusiastically recommended!
B00000JMOF|4.0|This is the real deal of monster films.<br />The classic Frankenstein to own.<br />Amazon must like annoying it's users by requiring more words than necessary.<br />Stop it!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have been sitting here for hours playing i probably need to eat some food point is its a fun game
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game it is really fun and its free!! But the bad part is that you only start out with 12 tokens and its 2 for one game...but they do have some good prices for the tokens but I would never buy any because everyone knows it's just a waste of money. But I love this game, the graphics are amazing and the game is super fun!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Loved it. I Can't  wait for more. Great graphics and feels like you're in the game.<br />It's  not too hard but enough of a challenge.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Everyone should watch and own this movie.  I never get tired of it.  It is a classic don't trust your government.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|When I open the app it's tells me I need to update it,however I checked my app updates and it  not showing one for this app. But still won't let me play it.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|The dialog in this book is the worst I've ever read.  Also, the plot is completely unbelievable. I wold bet this author didn't talk to a single police officer in coming up with this drivel.
B003XT60KO|5.0|Henry Hazlitt is an amazing economics author.  He helps the reader understand the dangers of thinking only one step out when it comes to issues of economic policy.  Don't forget the &#34;forgotten man&#34; who pays for the policy (but is generally left out of the equation)....Don't forget the long term (possibly bad) implications of a seemingly &#34;good&#34; policy with an obvious immediate beneficiary.  I recommend to anyone high school age or older.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Fantastic,  every song from start to finish is awesome. Can't stop from listening to every song that reflects a mood or memory. Brilliant young men indeed.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|for fantasy fiction addict.s you cant go wrong with this author the Mistborn series is one of the best trilogies i have read love all of his books
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This would not work on my Kindle Fire HD. Too bad that this information is not provided when searching for a Kindle aop.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|very interesting and fun read. As a reader i couldnt wait to find out what was going to happen to Piper. But I kept waiting for a big conflict or surprise change in the plot line. Then i realized that it was more non-fiction than that, and she is just telling what actually happened to her. still very cool and intriguing.
1400095204|5.0|I lived in Nigeria for a year and loved it.  Though I was there long after the war, many of the Igbo people I meant still remembered the horrors of the Biafra War.  Great book!
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Great read.  Lots of information to help inspire all of us to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to start participating as makers in this new industry.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I  love that it's a &#34;who done it&#34; and that I get to figure it out as the story plays out.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I wanted a very simple, reasonably priced mechanical watch. The watch keeps time very well so far, and it's kept itself going without pause, I leave it face down at night. Really like the utilitiarian style and light weight. Didn't realize it had a window in back to see the mechanism, my kids think it's cool but not really important to me.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book addresses one of the most controversial subjects of our time, but with a sweetness and humor that keeps the pages turning.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|starts out kinda slow building a plot.... but escalates with each episode. Lots of nude and vulgar scenes that can seems shocking at first but then kinda just helps set the era and perversity of each twist.  Definitely not PG-13. Much more suited for older adults.
B00472NZDQ|5.0|One of the best Haller - Connelly, I read with pleasure and excitment. Hope the next Haller novel is as good as this one.
B00D3LA5WG|1.0|The DVD was defective and didn't play.  DVD bogged down and would not continue altho' attempt was made to play it.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|Should've had a better ending, but overall a great book. Great for all ages. It is a must to read the second book!!
B002ZG976U|5.0|YOU GO GIRL, CHRISTINA MADE THIS MOVIE A HIT NOT CHER, BUT CHER LOOK ED GREAT. GREAT JOB GIRLS. i LOVE THE SONG NEED A TOUGH LOVER ITS AWESOME
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers is one of those books you can't put down. The sad circumstances of an abandoned child and her eventual redemption appeals straight to the heart. The Language of Flowers is skillfully woven through the story, lightening the pain and sweetening the bitterness. I was laughing and crying at the same time
B00ELP1U6S|1.0|The two ce fanntral characters in this novel are dissipants who do not deserve much admiration. I do not consider this one of the Fitzgeralds better novels. The writing is excellent, but the characters lack of moral fiber is discouraging  The fact that many critics consider F.Scott and his wife Zelda to be the models for these two central characters is insulting.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who is not an avid Fitzgerald
B00AEBB932|5.0|Fast service.  Speedy delivery.  This film has not aged although our ideas about heroes have.  This is a great American story about right and wrong, bravery and cowardice, and greed and sacrifice.  Performances by Alan Ladd, Jack Palance, Van Heflin, and Jean Arthur are strong.  Some of the camera angles and edits are a bit contrived to accommodate Alan Ladd's short stature, but only if you know to look for them.  This is truly a class western which uses the Grand Tetons as its backdrop.
B00E6895M6|5.0|Oh my... synthpop throwback bliss! This debut album by Chvrches is right there alongside other recent great nostalgia filled albums by Cut Copy & The Naked and Famous. I bought this unheard except for one track off their recent EP, and am just blown away by each track - it just keeps getting better and better the whole way through. Production is tops too - all of the sounds are placed very well, synths aren't overly dominating, and the female vocalist is very charming.
B008SVS3M0|5.0|John Hiatt never makes a bad record and this one is stellar as usual. Getting it on vinyl makes that much more enjoyable.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|BEST SEEN WHEN U WAS ON YOUR DATE WITH FARMER AND ENDED IN BED WITH HIM THAT WAS HOT GIRL. I KNOW YOUR IN HEAVEN WITH THE LORD. WISH U COULD COME BACK.  WILL MISS U AND THAT AWESOME VOICE OF YOURS.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is just like temple run but better but when I played sometimes it starts to glitch so be aware of that
B002VECM6S|5.0|Life deals us obstacles, challenges, hardship, and more.  With someone like Bullock's character alongside us, we can accomplish far more than we think possible.<br /><br />This movie is a splendid example and reminder.  We just might be the &#34;team&#34; someone needs today!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My 5 year old granddaughter loves this. I built it for her on Christmas morning, she didn't let anyone touch it, nor did she. After a few months she would finally play with it. She got another set in the series for her birthday and loves that one too.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  Beware, though, because it is addicting.  My daughter laughed at me when I first started playing, and she held off downloading it for quite a while.  Once she got it, she played it more than I do.  Her husband and kids also love it! I like the challenges.  So much more fun than regular solitaire.  Never boring! And if I don't like my score, I can replay the hole.  Love beating that gopher!
B008VBYN80|5.0|best farmville rts I have played in a long time. not to slow, combat is fun. graphics are very well done.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I totally recommend this app.  I have this at work and knew it would be great for Kindle fire with all the reading I do.  Would highly recommend it.
159448385X|5.0|Hosseini put his heart into Laila, the power of witnessed brutality in Rasheed, and his soul into Miriam. His endurance into Nana, who represents all misunderstood mothers of Afghanistan at the time. His wisdom and good nature into Aziza, and his suffering bottled into Fariba. These characters have become as close to me as the people you come across, that touch you enough to put you into a brief trance in remembering the flashes of their smiles, the words they filled with their voice, the individual stories that they carry like brilliant, alluring stars within them. Never before have I read a book twice and said that it changed who I am both times. This is a legend that you will keep cherished within the layers of your mind with the bursting radiance of a thousand splendid suns.
0525478817|5.0|This was another required book for her English class. She enjoyed reading this book. It was something that could happen in our own lives. The book was delivered in a timely manner and in great condition.o
B008RA3X5E|5.0|So good. Simple, attractive and has all the qualities of a fine alarm clock. I recommend this one to anyone shopping around.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I believe that these books are the best 'who done it&#34; books that I have ever read--love them-I think all of David Baldacci's books are outstanding
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this was a great book! I liked the fact that there were a few more characters in the story and learned a bit about them. I don't know what all the negatives were about. I look forward to the next installment!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Pretty decent if you like a good challenge. A bit small on the print, but overall a fun app. Bonus at the end is only opened if you like on FB or post a review, therefore the 4 stars.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I know it was panned at the box office but IMO it was worth watching.  Two excellent actors and an interesting plot twist.  It's definitely worth the $3.99 rental fee.
1439193630|5.0|I love this book! It is entertaining with great practical use for writing.  This is certainly one book that I will keep.  I use this book as a tool for several forms of writing. Must have for everyone!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. This game really beats boredom too! Recommend? Yes. Completely recommend this game!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good show to follow it you like courtroom drama.  Good family dynamics as well to keep the interest up.  Not boring at all.
B00CVQYMB4|5.0|I picked it up after reading the book and really like it.  I read it each day, along with my other daily readings.  I usually subtitute the word God wherever &#34;universe&#34; is used, because that's what I believe.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I felt that it jumped around too much and had a hard time getting this book for the first half.  I eventually grew familiar with the characters and then was better able to follow the storyline.<br />I had to say overall that it just barely kept my interest.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Surfing through Prime looking for a movie and came across this one. Guess I live in a cave cause I had never heard of it.  I figured why not and hit play.  It surprised me.  The acting was decent and had a decent plot.  A little over the top on the gore so not a movie to watch with the younger kids.  My wife watched about 10 minutes and left the room - definitely a &#34;guy&#34; movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it! Brilliant story. I love the gunslinger series. This is the best since then. Finally an exciting nail biter with less gore.
B003VPUX9O|5.0|Daniel Silva has created just the right guy, flawed, but strong and he is not invincible.<br />Kept my interest and I will be reading the series on Gabriel Allon.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Bought this movie because my husband and I saw it in theater.<br />My husband is also in the Navy which made him love this movie even more. I think he secretly wishes to battle aliens too and he joined the navy before this movie came out. My mother can't stop watching it either. The movie is amazing on Bluray and the special effects are phenomenal!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I enjoyed reading it very much.  Being a daily reader of the Bible, I began to susbtitute God for 'Universe' early on, and found it very helpful.
1451695195|5.0|This book was very uplifting, it started out with the message not to worry you were loved..What a powerful way to question sciences, the doctors are still more than puzzled by Eben Alexander being alive and well after seven days in a coma. I have always &#34;hoped&#34; that there is more to our life on this earth and this book is real proof.<br /> I saw the author and listened to his presentation, he told that for years he did not go to church only believed that the brain was our center of live, now he knows that our conscience deep within us is.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked almost everything.<br />I choose 5 because how much I loved it.<br />I liked all the adventure.<br />It's very awesome
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|My only complaint is Malcolm only publishes once a year, I wish he published more often. Really enjoy your work. Greetings From Atlanta, GA. My best wishes to you.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but I watched this documentary and its mix open and brutally honest reflections by McNamara, mixed in with historical film reflections that provide a great viewpoint not only into the mind of a very intelligent man, but also of such historical times that is beyond the comprehension of today's younger generations.<br /><br />This is probably the best documentary that I've watched in many years, if not ever and validates my subscription to Amazon Prime.

B000N2HBSO|3.0|I got a glowing review for this book from an acquaintance.  I'm not really sure why she was so excited about it.  We obviously don't have the same taste in history books, but this did have some interesting facts about Lincoln.  I just kept waiting for it to be wonderful and it didn't happen.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I truly loved this book. There were so many twists and nothing like I expected it to be, but in a good way. Thank you for writing this amazing story!
B00BSBVLF8|2.0|Some stunts were amazing, but the 'movie' was just too weird.  I'm sure seeing it live is a different 'story'.

This sound confirms he's reached his full potential as a singer/songwriter/performer!

B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|A few other reviewers have mentioned glitches in the graphics, a problem I am also experiencing to some degree. Little flashes (pixellated areas) appear on the screen at times during play. So far, they have been easy to ignore (I've just played the first dozen levels). I experienced something similar in AB Seasons early on, but it was apparently fixed in an update.<br /><br />With AB Friends rating a total \\"fail\\" in my book due to its connection with Facebook, I was very happy to see this new release. Angry Birds is still one of the best games on the market. After a hard day's work, it's fun to come home, sit down and relax by blowing things up at a leisurely pace.<br /><br />Addendum: Having now earned three stars in all the basic levels, I am still missing quite a few of the character \\"rewards,\\" and the points I've accumulated don't even come close to the virtual expense involved in fleshing out the collection. I thought I'd check the cash-money requirements for purchasing additional points, and I was absolutely STUNNED by the prices. Unless new characters are released in updates, it looks like your minimum outlay might be in the neighborhood of $50, and that's only if you are a very skilled player. I'm still waiting for the update (new world) to AB Star Wars (original) to come through for Kindle Fire. Should I believe \\"COMING SOON\\" in either version?
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|We are avid star trek fans loved this movie. Would recommend purchased two one for me and one for my dsughter
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Iron Man 3 is the follow up movie to the Avengers so it had a lot to live up to. The first Iron Man movie pretty much set up what super hero movies needed to do it had a good balance of humor and action to make it to a successful and a great movie. The 2nd one was good as well despite it being slower paced. Then of coarse we get the Avengers which is one of the best if not the best super hero movies ever made so how does this one live up. Well my biggest grip with this movie is that it doesn't feel like a iron man movie. It feels more like Die hard or lethal weapon with Tony Stark and robots. Theres actually more fighting outside of his iron man armor in this movie then with it on and when he does have it on it breaks apart. As for the villain the kinda butchered what the Mandarin was about worse yet the had a guy that closely looked like the one from the comics and turned it into a joke and the real one was just a generic white guy. Also the ten rings that the mandarin used was turned into some weird genetic experiments so in my opinion the villain was the worst part. Anyway there is some good things about the movie the end fight was pretty epic and there was a lot of good humor here just as the 1st movies were. The acting is good and of coarse Robert Downey jr. is still the perfect choice for tony stark. So do I recommend this movie I would say rent it first and see what you think of it its not perfectly done like the original movie but theres still some fun to be had here 3.9/5 stars
B0027J4SKA|5.0|I feel this singer is very underrated.  Her music is soulful and her voice is so easy to listen to.  Buy this, you will not be disappointed.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Too much cheesy Romeo and Juliet, not enough original plot.  It seemed like a mash up of Twilight and True Blood, except replace vampire with witches/casters.  It was okay but definitely not what I expected after reading other reviews and opinions.  A little disappointed.

B0027MJU00|3.0|G.FLynn's a  talented writer.  This is a dark tale of a horrific event and the and the solution not what I expected.<br />a great book.
0739375970|5.0|Imagination like this is hard to find, though I think the author lost his way a little in this one compared to others. It's an amazing world and a lot of complexity to continue and carry on.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I don't know how to play it.  My kid likes it.  He plays it everyday.  Why do I have to write about this?  Why can't I just give it 5 stars?
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|There were many things I enjoyed about this book.  At a basic level, I love the world that Brandon created.  It is easy to relate to this reality in a lot of ways, because it is mostly based on our world if this were to happen a bit in the future.<br /><br />On top of that, I did really enjoy the development of the characters overall.  There was enough depth given to most of them in ways that wasn't over the top and you learned about them in ways that helped to progress the story.  I also loved that time wasn't spent trying to explain what had changed the world, because that wouldn't be necessary for the story.<br /><br />The only part that felt a little bit forced was the requisite \\"love story\\" of the main character.  It was only very marginally explored before becoming full-blown infatuation, in my opinion and ended up coming across a little more like he would be her stalker.  It really could have been just a strong friendship and it would have made more sense for this part of the story I think.<br /><br />The book was fantastic overall and it definitely made me anxious that I have to wait until next fall (2014) to read the next!

0194313425|4.0|I have been teaching English since 1975 and have been using the various editions of this grammar since then.  It is just what it's title says it is - a practical grammar.  I provides easy to understand explanations along with relevant examples.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Not the best series out there, but intersting and fun to watch. The word minimum for reviews is annoying. Amazon should remove it.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|I believe that Will Smith should stop promoting his son in movies. The story is not bad but you could have done a lot more with it. The acting of Will Smith's son (see - I do not even recall his name -_- ...) is plain horrible. Not the first movie where I would have preferred to see another child actor than the one that was chosen. The movie is unfortunately very plain and uneventful (in my opinion) and I would not watch it again.
0061537969|5.0|What a lovely surprise was this read!  Being written from the point of view of the beloved dog, the writing carries one along in a revelatory current.  Absolutely delightful even for non dog lovers
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google has started a small revolution in this little unit.  Many reviews I've read focus on the lack on content, but I feel they are missing the point.  After lots of frustration spelling movie names on a roku box, it is a joy to be able to use my familiar phone interface to search for movies or youtube videos and play them on my projector.  More content will come, but this is every bit worth it for netflix and youtube alone.
8866131350|5.0|The 18 month was very useful since I bought it mid year. It's small and portable enough to carry anywhere. I looked at the planner with the week on one side and notes on the other, and the planner with the week spread over both sides. Personally, I find the former more useful, allowing me to jot notes that pertain to the week instead of being forced onto any one particular day. Standard awesome moleskin quality.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I have heard how awesome this is... and I am glad we finally are watching it! I highly recommend it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I learned at a young age playing this game with cards at the kitchen table by my father. This brough good memories. have always enjoyed playing this game.<br />.
0316236535|5.0|My daughter and I found this book at our local library.  She is almost 3 and immediately fell in love with it- so I bought this as well as &#34;Nighty, Night, Little Green Monster&#34;.  She loves the colors and the predictability of the story line.  She likes to &#34;read&#34; it to me as well.  Plus, it has out to rest a few minor fears she had concerning monsters- being able to say &#34;Go Away!&#34; Has been very therapeutic. :)  Worth the money!  A super fun read.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|with some interesting twists. The requisite number of villians, mages, and devastatingly beautiful women (although not developed except in memory, mostly, but we can look forward to the book that does bring her along). Locke is a great character, with a touch of hubris, and the faithful companion that a character like that needs. I enjoyed reading this one, and you probably will also, if you like the Fantasy genre.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I wanted to go with an old-fashioned battery-less watch and found a high quality piece at a very reasonable price.  I'm still find that  the minute markings on the dial throw me off a bit, but it is minor.  If I were to start over I'd get a version of the same watch with full waterproofing (100m vs. 30m) and standard hour markings on the face.
0061808121|5.0|This book was purchased at the urging of my 15 year old daughter to listen to while I drove her to school. I have thoroughly enjoyed the story, and Sissy Spacek has a fantastic voice for presenting this narrative from Scout's perspective.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a really good book and I can't wait to read the third one. It is fast and action packed. This is one of the books that I would recommend to another person.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|Let me start like I usually do for this series.  No, I don't watch the show.  I am more interested in the books.<br /><br />So I finally manage to finish this book after putting it off for practically a month.  So far I have really enjoyed this author's work.  He really knows how to weave an entire world with an in depth history and characters who have real motivations driving them.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />I do have to mention to you before you read this.  If you like fantasy books that have their main characters living through impossible situations no matter how much danger they are put into, you may want to skip this one.  Because in this book we are shown that main characters can die and are just as mortal as the rest of us.<br /><br />Also we finally get some satisfaction when a few characters that we loved to hate through the first two books, FINALLY get their just deserts!  I cannot tell you how happy I was when that lunatic Joffrey finally met with the Grim Reaper.  And Shae, that two-timing witch finally got what she deserved.  She had a man who loved her dearly but she threw it away for a chance at money and prestige, and Tyrion gets his revenge!<br /><br />Plus I FINALLY get what I really wanted out of these books!  We are shown an epic battle at The Wall between the Night Watch and the wild men beyond the wall.  We have giants, mammoths, barbarians, an epic siege, and it's told in such an amazing way that it keeps you riveted to the book!<br /><br />Stannis makes his move toward the end of the book and we find out his true ambitions!  Not to mention that Sansa, (Oh god how I hate this character), finally escapes Kings Landing and DOES something!  And Arya, oh how I LOVE this character!  She finally gets to cross a few names off of her list and she gets to use that iron coin that she got in one of the previous books.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, my only complaint is that it is just too LONG!!!  It clocks in at 1128 pages, and it just dragged in some places.  Other than that, this is a really great book!  Anyone who liked the first two books will love this addition to the series!<br /><br />Check it out!d this book, my only complaint is that it is just too LONG!!!

0761172726|5.0|I have used this calendar for a few years now and find it the best way to organize/plan my family's activities. Some have mentioned that the space for each person for each day is small, but I usually don't have more than two things per person per day, so it is perfect for me and my family.
B007HO392S|5.0|Best CD thus far !!  I love Carrie Underwood !!  I always get my music on Amazon, they beat all on price
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|this device does not transmit content from ipad to TV smoothly,  especially from any internet browser including Chrome browser.  it only work with YouTUBE and NetFlix, but hard to pause and restart
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My son and I both enjoy this app. I would give five stars but the gems and bananas run out quickly and it costs real money to get more in a significant quantity. My son cannot save up his because the pop ups get him to spend all his bananas. Overall great game very addicting and easy for my five year old to play by himself.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Great movie! So true that sometimes parents really do know their children, if it's hard to admit it! Moms do know best.
0399159347|5.0|Very well written book. Loved it from beginning to end and what an end. Best part of the book really. I have been passing it on to others as a great read. My daughter's book club should read this one.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This is certainly a rare occurrence. In matter of fact I have never heard of it before. A band reediting an 11 year old album. This was needed though. I used to listen to Vapor Trails back in 2002 and imagine myself editing and improving that recording myself. This album is perfect. Even if you find you like the original one better is is worth buying this one just to compare for yourself and hear what could of been. I will tell you it is different! If you are a fan please buy this one and find out for yourself which one you prefer. As for me I prefer this new one with is sonic clarity that brings out the detail like you have never heard before.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is the first time i write a review ...it because i could not but tell evryone that it is the best app i ever had
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I enjoyed the way that this world is presented.  Puzzling this fantasy world and its history together is an enjoyable challenge.  Explicit definitions and explanations are avoided, letting the reader learn new terms via context.  Excellent exposition and an engaging air of mystery.
B000VI12ZS|3.0|This movie tops &#34;Private Ryan&#34; for Violence. Would like to have more background of the idea for the windtalkers.  A fascinating piece of history.  Not sure what was historically accurate in this film.
074356619X|5.0|THIS CD SET WAS SUCH MUCH MORE THAN WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE! I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME AND FEEL BETTER EACH AND EVERY TIME I DO LISTEN TO IT !
B008JFUR10|3.0|Except for the Oriental chick every single one of the pilots were stuck-up, know-it-alls, which in real life are the very people that I just can't stand. Consequently this is what brought the movie down from 5 stars to 3 for me. You would think that because of the entire planet being in jeopardy that every human still alive would be cooperative and professional when it came to doing their jobs. Yes, piloting the bots would no doubt be an awesome experience, but in the end you're a pilot with a job to do, so why would anyone think to put people in the pilot's seat who are headstrong and insubordinate as all of these pilots seemed to be.<br /><br /> The special affects were what got this movie to a 3 star rating. Without the sweet visuals I probably wouldn't have even finished this movie. Some of the acting was good and even funny in places, but because of the idiotic attitude of the pilots the movie just fell short of outright entertaining. In fact, as soon as the movie was over I went online and canceled my pre-order for the BluRay.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is an invaluable tool. I am checking it all the time. Thanks for an app that offers upnto date infor in an accessible format.
B004UG7RQ0|2.0|I bought this to use it to run from a Bose Dock to a MacBook Air and sometimes an Ipad.  I've had it a a little over a year, and in that time I've used it on average less than twice a week.  I have never moved the Bose it was attached to, and the CableJive has been treated well.<br /><br />In the beginning, it would work alright after being &#34;jiggled&#34; where it connected to the Bose, but it would sound static-like if not &#34;jiggled&#34; around.  After a year, and maybe 100 or so uses, the jiggling stopped working.  Now it sounds static-like all the time. I know it is not the Bose's connection, because I've tested other devices on it, and they all play well.<br /><br />Next time, I'll spend a few more dollars to buy my adapter directly from Bose or Apple, so I can have a better product.

B00E1LPK40|4.0|Love the album! However, the vinyl mp3 download link does not work. Anyone else having this issue? The link I've tried was [...] Any help would be appreciated!
B001NB5BA4|5.0|A lot of extremely good songs on this album.  The poetic language used in some of the songs still amazes me.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|I have only viewed it once since receiving it but the picture and audio quality is excellent, I had viewed excerpts on youtube but to experience the DVD on my system was a treat. The performances are all excellent as well, there is always a tendency to criticize but in this case the sincerity with which the concert is delivered would render it churlish to do so. Scorpions certainly deliver the goods on this DVD, I would highly recommend it.<br />NB: The obvious eye candy is pretty staged but certainly forgiveable.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Plays a lot like Mario Brothers. Both my kids and myself like it. It starts out easy and progresses into harder levels as you go.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lots of twist and turns to keep you interested. I hated the book to end. The ending was sweet though
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|It's a pretty good game, but it's limited by the Kindle Fire. You can't blow to keep the plane in the air, but there's a solution: in settings you can disable the &quot;plane game&quot;. However, sometimes touches don't register on my kindle, and it appears that it can only handle two fingers with multi touch, which makes the moose game impossible to win as well if the character gets shot more than once.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|4/5 Stars; simply because it is as close as i can get to gaming using an X360 controller on a PS3. I have both consoles, and the transition between DS3 and 360 controller is something of a gripe rather than an experience that i enjoyed; typically when the PS3 games has a lot of shooting element.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- the ergonomic feel of the controller; mimics the 360's layout.<br />- comfortable matte textures and contour grip; feels nice on the palm of my hand<br />- zero lag; works as good as DS3 in terms of response<br />- quality build; it doesn't feel like any cheap imitation 3rd party controller, built to last and no loose / &#34;wiggly&#34; parts<br />- value for money; i got it at a reasonable price<br />- quick setup; no hassle, plug and play<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- the triangle button is not so responsive; i had to push the button harder than i would have on a DS3 controller<br />- albeit the R2 / L2 trigger button being designed in an outward convexed / contour, there is still a need to push it &#34;harder&#34; compared to 360 controller. But it is way better than PS3's DS3 R2/L2 button.<br /><br />Additional Notes: I've been using this controller for the past 4 days. it felt great on the hands. I didn't really encounter any huge dead-zones as most of the reviews had mentioned. I noticed i can get more precision shots done using this controller; simply due to the L3 / R3 layout's similarity to 360. it had that same &#34;twitch&#34; feeling similar to a 360 controller typically when you line your shots (when you twitch / nudge quickly on your L3 on a 360).<br /><br />Since then, this controller had replaced my DS3 in all of my PS3's play-troughs. Only time will tell whether this controller can stand the test of rigorous torture from continuous usage and those long play-troughs.
B0081TWXUC|5.0|I believe I could listen to this album over and over again.<br />The music is extremely creative.  Very good songs.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I couldn't put it down!<br />Beautifully written fantasy. Characters superbly crafted and believable. A fairytale for grown ups.<br />Highly recommend.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|The dvd's are cheap and the pixtels fade out.  A disk genie helps a little.  On the other hand, the price is half what is often seen.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'm watching it now for the third time. And each time I see something new or hear another bit I didnt hear before. Everyone involved...to a fault....is excellent.<br />If you are into English history (I got a D back in university days) this is a must!<br />I think now, that I would easily ace the course.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Funny, good information and the guys are nice to look at. It shows what happens when secrets are kept and how they can backfire.

0425261360|2.0|Oh, Ms. Cornwell! I am afraid that you have milked every last bit of my interest in Kay Scarpetta and her cronies. This series has gotten so old, so predictable, and so dull, that it was a real chore to muddle through it. I will always have fond memories  of the early books where Kay was in Virginia, and Marino was her trusty sidekick. However, put a fork in me, because I am done. Time for you to move on to other characters, and other stories--if you have them in you. If not, enjoy your millions, do good deeds, and recall your glory days. I bid you and Kay a fond farewell, as this is the last Scarpetta book I will read.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Another good John and Kate book. Not as good as The Lion, but still good reading. Can't wait to see what is next!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author again carefully walks the reader through the spiritually abusive situations in Afghanistan and then the resulting lives and their paths, throughout our world.  Unconditional love, as always, carries the individuals involved to beautiful ,  fulfilled lives.

B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was neat to see inside a prison from this perspective but I thought it was too long and didn't hold my interest,
B0012QTT4O|1.0|How disappointing to pay for one of the greatest shows ever put on TV and find that Amazon - with all the stuff they sell and distribute here - has decided to CENSOR this show.<br /><br />They've edited out language they deem ... I don't know ... \\"inappropriate\\" for a show about METH DEALERS???<br /><br />And they've decided this show also shouldn't have any nudity, so they've PIXELATED breasts. It's juvenile, it's insulting, and IT IS NOT BREAKING BAD - but some Sunday school teacher's lame redaction of Breaking Bad.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS. Buy the disks, and buy them somewhere else. Anywhere else.<br /><br />(Oh, and Netflix has the real Breaking Bad. And it streams better with fewer \\"loading\\" interruptions - in fact, none - whereas Amazon was constantly stopping randomly and making us wait while the \\"loaded\\" AND reduced the quality. By the time we arrived at 42 minutes into Episode One - at 1 a.m. on a weeknight - they had degraded the quality to the point that it looked - no exaggeration - worse than what I could shoot on my phone's video recorder.)<br /><br />A total rip off.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a great book but it was very sad. If you don't like soppy romance books this is not for you.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|For families--Big R rated. Shockingly violent, not just sexuality but SEX, homosexuality, degrading of women, human slaughter, plus the usual language and rootem,shootem violence.<br />For story content--I kept looking throughout the nearly THREE HOURS for how these stories connect. I didn't see it. It was hard to follow, hard to keep track of what is going on in each story, shockingly violent, toooooo long, and in the end--what was the point? I guess it is based on the idea of reincarnation and that we get another chance to learn and get it right, but keep making the same mistake over and over. However, I didn't get much of that from following the stories and characters--that was just the narrator, toward the end. For some characters it was more obvious-the cheater/thief keeps thieving and the fixer keeps trying to fix and remains a victim. But by that time I was feeling cheated out of my three hours--and so what was the point of this anyway? Use your three hours to do something meaningful--get some exercise, play with your kids, read a good book.
1446249182|4.0|This is the most enjoyable math book I've read. I appreciate the author's efforts to turn dry material into a palatable read.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you have not seen Doctor Who's new series, you've GOT to see this episode. A Big Brother house in which voted off contestants 'die.' A Weakest Link with 'Anne Droid' in which the weakest link is 'killed' by a laser. [Regarding the uses of punctuation around the words, 'die' and 'killed,' all I can say is (sorry for the pun), SPOILERS!] Excellent episode to more fully introduce Eccleston.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It's a nice idea-to be able to look at the full version-but it's so slow, I usually just use the mobile version.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Such imagination. The characters are relatable and people you want to see have a happy ending. Amazing story a must read for any book club.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly is the show that never should have been canceled. It is well worth watching and on Prime you can watch them all.

B002XBVQKW|2.0|But the collection is not vast way less than netflix Im thinking if this will ever grow or will be the same
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|I am a real Oz aficionado, I know all the books and I know the real soul of the stories.  This tale comes from a cute idea, telling the tale of how the Wizard came to Oz in the first place, but it goes against many of the facts stated in the books and re-casts characters dramatically, making it far less compelling and hard to take seriously.  It might have worked if the plot and dialogue had been better, but alas, they weren't.  Basically it became a tale of a ne'er-do-well charlatan who finds his true purpose defending a land and a pretty princess from wicked witches.  Sappy.  And a lot of things left unexplained, like at the end, it seems like the Wizard is saying goodbye like he's going back to Kansas, but he's not, is he?  Confusing.  And if he's going to rule as the Wizard, what's going to happen to Glinda, who got made into the princess for some reason when everyone who knows Oz knows that the princess was Ozma and the Wizard conspired to hide her so that he could rule.  It's a shame, really, because the actors were great, the effects were great, but the movie just doesn't come together.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am addicted the The Falling Skies, I watched season 1 & 2 within weeks and now Season 3 will just have to wait.<br />As a prime member the first two season was free, but I don't want to buy the third season.  I don't collect shows and movies, I would never get anything done. Falling Skies episodes has had me at the edge of my seat most of the way, not good before bedtime!  Love it!.
1401942601|5.0|The art work on the cards is beautiful and the message on each one makes it very easy to do a reading.  Because of the subject matter on the individual cards this deck can be used for any type of question.  I would recommend this to beginning readers as well as advanced.  I think you will be very pleased with this deck.  I believe it is one of Doreen's best.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Such a great concert, great memories, made even more so after the deaths of Maurice and Robin.  Fantastic group who survived &#34;disco,&#34; even when they were unfairly blamed for it!  Fantastic singers/songwriters, lost to the world.  Barry carries on, though.  Bless him with long life...
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I had initially heard of Howl's Moving Castle from the movie. Hayao Miyazaki's version is one of my absolute favorite movies ever. The last time I watched it, I happened to notice it was based on a book. I immediately went searching for it and ended up reading it in only a few days time. Had I had more free time, I probably would have finished it in a single day. It was that good, I just couldn't put it down! Mrs. Jones has a wonderful way of wording the story. It was easy enough for a younger reader to follow, but written well enough for a more mature reader to enjoy as well. She definitely has a knack for creating memorable characters. I really fell in love with Sophie. She was so down to Earth and really seemed to help ground Howl's overly eccentric and flamboyant personality. But she has her own flaws as well which help make her that much more interesting. I love the movie version of this story and highly recommend it to any fan of the book, but I have to say I enjoyed the book much better. This story has succeeded in taking a very special place in my heart. Thank you Mrs. Jones for this wonderful tale!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I really recommend this book, but just make sure you don't get ideas from it. I wish the book had not ended.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I chose this book because it held a little controversy for me.<br />I liked it because the author made it rather funny, but some<br />of it actually made me mad.<br />I would suggest it if you have an open mind about things.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I am forever encouraged and changed by Adam Brown's faith and courage.  This book is the inspiring drama of a life that started well, stumbled and then finished amazing! Through the power of faith, family, love and friends
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Good action, good acting, good job of making an emotional connection with characters but a very typical and easily predictable story line.
0062255657|4.0|A great story, it was hard not to read it all in one sitting! My first Neil Gaiman book and I can't wait to start another of his novels, it is an original story about a young boy living in Sussex which completely draws you into his life and adventures with his eccentric neighbors who have their own 'ocean' among other secrets.... Gaiman is a genius writer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is an awesome series.  I didn't want it to end.  I want more!  Great show!  Thank you Netflix!
B00594XOZU|1.0|PLEASE FIX THE FREAKING APP!!! All of the sudden it just stopped working and now i can't text on my kindle :(
B002WN35DC|5.0|I would recommned this story for everyone who likes fantasy tales. You can read it at any time! Perfect for kids, teens and adults.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Only complaint would pimento be able to trade coins for glue credits.  otherwise. I enjoy the challenge.  not to easy not to hard.
B000007VCM|5.0|I love this CD. It is an awesome selection of rock songs. In this album, I can say easily I like at least 6 of their songs among the 11 songs.
B00511ONPG|4.0|a practical and interesting book on getting started and growing your marketing strategies and social media efforts. Keeping it as a reference for myself and it's definitely recommended reading for those trying to get their marketing off the ground particularly contemporary companies interested in social media marketing.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is an excellent app. Really nice to have the opportunity to choose the size of the video. Thank you!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|you just cant get enough!  level after level, my lil cousin is 3 and he loves it. its a great game for kids! you have to try it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Thus was a great read and it really makes you stop and think how you would feel if your child were accused of a crime. Loved it.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Everyone should see this movie it is awesome it really gives a good perspective on life and how people can it is ok to be your self
B00CLD65X0|4.0|I love this series!  It is so well done and captures one's attention throughout.  The only reason there is not five stars is that I did not always agree with the writers' decisions regarding story line.  It is a great series and can't wait to see more.
B008Y212PI|5.0|THIS APP IS AMAZING! it's fun and challenging, and soon you will catch on. I did. Truly awsome! Super, duper, fun!!!
B005SDB6RK|5.0|We enjoyed watching  this when we rented dvd from Redbox so we bought this for our 16 year old grandson- his family only watched a few minutes- they said it was &#34;slow&#34;. We disagree! This was so entertaining-amazing views,and we had never seen snow boarding like this!!1
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|its a good game but sometimes hard to play, on kindle. other than that it is a good game for kids, you just show them how to play.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I feel like I am 29 going on 15 and I am not ashamed. If you like twilight , you will love The mortal instruments series. I feel like it is a little less cheesy though because it is not only vampires that sparkle in the sunlight. This book involves all sorts of dark creatures from Vampires, to werewolves, to demons. I highly recommend it !
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I can't get anough of this TV series. I have ordered all the seasons and have really enjoyed the creative writing and acting skills of all the charactrers.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Make sure you have plenty of free time.  Once you start watching it is hard to stop.  Have recommended this show to many others.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Of course I got started because of the HBO series, but these books don't disappoint. I wish that there was a little more continuity so that I could remember the state that a character was in the last time that the book have covered that character, but all in all, these are great books. Not quite Lord of the Rings, but really close.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Absolute crap!  Lame remake of various Trek themes.  The actors do the best they can with a stinker of a story line.  How many remakes of the Wrath of Khan can we endure?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is a good game but, some levels are hard and it goes prety fast. very challenging for gammers really.
1609613937|5.0|I am a thin 63 year old woman with high cholesterol and chronic headaches  .  After watching the wonderful movie \\"forks and knives\\", I started on a vegan diet to lower my cholesterol. Then I got introduced to Dr McDougall and bought the book which I love. It makes going vegan easier because I stopped trying to fill up on green and yellow vegetables. And, yes, starches are comfort foods for sure. I will test my cholesterol after 2 months and see what I get. By the way, I have not eliminated oils but have drastically reduced them.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|fantastic addition to my collection, and of course David Tennant is an awesome doctor, will be collecting all my missing seasons
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I've been dieting on and off since age 14 and I'm a grandparent.  The only time I was slim was when I smoked.  I manage to stay a hair below obesity mainly because I go on yet another diet, get my weight down and then go back to how I was eating to gain weight in the first place.  After going on the Fast Diet, I discovered why diets haven't worked for me.  The idea of being on a diet day after day  is just too much.  I have tried diets which have specific recipes to follow and these have been the worst for me.  I become hyper-focused on food and when I don't have an ingredient, or miss a recipe I use it as an excuse to pig out and then I'm done.  I don't have an iron discipline which is probably true of many people.  From the semi-fast I learned for the first time what it feels like to be a little hungry, and it's ok.  I can handle that for a day.  I eat more slowly and am more aware of what I am eating and how much.  What especially surprised me was the new attitude carried over on non-fast days.  I didn't over eat, and found I could have a donut once in awhile without feeling guilty or defiant...oh yeah, just watch me.  The important thing for me is that I can do this as a permanent change.  Once I get my weight to where it needs to be, I can fast once a week.  I've watched Dr Mosley on PBS and he does his research.  I have Type II Diabetes and my goal is to get to a normal weight and get off the meds.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Good CD and met my expectations.  Have loved them from the 80s and still do.  Worth the money. Thank you
B007G51UV0|4.0|Basic mb with many features that work. ASUS has long been my choice for quality motherboards and this one is not an exception.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|It's cool, sort of nice hack and slash that does not require to much strategy. I guess that goes for a lot of rpg's.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I love this show! Its all time funny as hell! These two together are a team of funny! Everyone should go out and buy this right now!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I had a variety of people tell me the Jack Reacher books were wonderful and I am glad I took their word for it.  Now I have a whole new series to read!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is wonderfully written and complete.y engaging.  I cared about the characters and learned a lot of history. While reading the book I went to a plantation and it all came alive.
B008MU8ZOI|1.0|I bought this item as I have the DVD and wanted the Blu-ray version.  I put it in my machine and it would nt work and machine stated it was a bad disc.
B00F87A7HG|5.0|This album has it all. From blusey at times to punk at others, and even to country sounds, and also hard rock. All genres are represented and several influences are shown. Parts of the album evoke memories of where the band came from, and yet other parts of it show where the band wants to go. I like the direction they are going right now.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy setup, no lag time from phone to what's on the screen. Google is working on new connection like Pandora
B00821PCJS|2.0|Not interesting to me.  Gave it a shot and the premise was not clear enough. I'm sure the younger generation thinks it is great, good for them.I'm just not interested in science fiction.
B00000E2VC|5.0|first of all the cover is incredible, but mostly these performances can be said to contain secrets of the history of the earth. Close your eyes and bloom incandescently with the breeze of the grace in piano conducting.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It was a good movie and it had some good points for that end of the world scenario. But his wifes character was annoying for the circumstances..
0120884674|4.0|I'm using this manual for my Human Osteology course, and while it is good for a start it is not detailed enough. It offers basic information to its readers, but does not offer enough information when it comes to things like dentition and siding. I would recommend getting William Bass' Lab and Field Manual, aka the Bass Field Bible, for more in-depth information. The two books together are a wonderful resource.
0763619612|5.0|My daughter loved this book! She heard it in school and I bought it for her. It was worth every penny!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's a yarn that is almost totally believable given the abuse of the RICO laws by overzealous government attorneys determined to score another win at any cost. The reader is drawn into the story by Grisham's prose and then hooked by the plot.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Very good read.  Great human interest stories that involved and tied together a few families. Good book.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a totally awesome game! I can not stop playing this game I . Want more games just like this . One
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I just really got into the characters and hope they developed them.  It was a really sad movie but I did enjoy it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can't seem to locate my favorites, I had to reset my kindle because of a bug I received on my kindle Fire HD. I made a fake group to see if it would work, it didn't work.<br />Note: (I did have the Facebook app before I had to reset and I had all my favorites on there.)<br />It also keeps bringing up a message that says that there is no internet connect which is ridiculous because how would I even be on Facebook in the first place if I didn't have an internet connection. Please Amazon do a bug fix or something to make our experience fun and easier!
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I w<br />Could watch this movie dozens of more times.  The actress that plays matilda is precious and danny and his wife are so perfectly ridiculous!<br />The villain is even more ridiculous and evil!<br />Kind of violent I would say for smaller kiddos but that's just me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Who gives a crap if the price is high you have to get it.better with stars now. get it now!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Help us need to fix kik on kindle cuz I try to sign in and log in but it load too long and show error.......
B009JZSC9S|4.0|I'm a fan. This is one of the most interesting American television productions in a long time. There are always enough surprises to keep viewers interested. The moral dilemmas are always provocative. The reason I didn't 5 stars is I think the courtroom scenes are getting a little stale and too overtly combative. I'm thinking the Alicia and Will story is more tease than substance.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It help me be on time for school. And it help me just to be able to function in the morning. This is a great app because you can  go to sleep and waking up it the morning to pleasant runs in the morning
076790592X|5.0|Very useful and interesting. I find the book adequate to my necessity. I strongly recommend it. Thank you very much.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved it :). Love the characters. Loved the Estate really pretty. Can't wait to watch season 3. Love it love it
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|We were watching the old series and this is the third in the series we loved it again as remembered
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Unfortunately this is another app that requires internet access to play. I can understand the need to connect to download, but not to play the games. I am going to delete this app from my Kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love  this game . It's just like subway surfers which is fun too. You should get it . It's entertaining .
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My only complaint is my Kindle fire HD does not work well with Chromecast.  My Galaxy s4 and MacBook and Windows 7 laptop work great with it.
0141032138|5.0|I chose this rating because it made me aware of how memory works, why am i good at remembering some things and not others; and gave me insight to what i need to do if I wanted to remember.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good, but a bit predictable. Tom is startimg to show his age. Morgan f part was too small to be effective
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|This game is fun for all ages I love to grow the food and helping the customers out you will love it
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Greatest peice of literature I've ever read...I could not put it down! It reminded me why I love to run
B0064MPXFA|5.0|- Wonder why I never watched it before!  Strong women who can make things happen.  Really enjoy the personal dynamics between characters!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I've been interested in the life of and times for Jesus for quite a long time, but it is difficult to find that information for one who is a) not a religious specialist or b) not already a believer in the divinity of Jesus. This book is written assuming you can follow logical arguments and that you care about the man Jesus rather than the Son of God Jesus; it completely sidesteps the divinity question. Instead, he looks at who Jesus was given the context of the times and then how the view of him has changed to something rather different due to the goals of the early church and  the atrocities done to the Jewish people in the decades following Jesus's execution. The takeaway is that you can't divorce the words and actions of Jesus from the fact that he was a Jew living when he did where he did, because without that context you can't understand why he did what he did or what those actions would have meant to the Jewish people.<br /><br />If you already believe greatly in the divinity of Jesus, that he knew he was the savior, that he died for the forgiveness of your sins, and that the bible is infallible then this might be a difficult book to read (but still incredibly useful to understand the context of the Gospels). But if you are at all interested in Jesus the man, his life, and his times, this is an exceedingly good read.  While I would love to have read it with footnotes or endnotes, it is intended for the general audience not the academic, so the decision seems to be one of accessibility for more people than obfuscation, so I wouldn't listen to some of the other reviewers about that.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|well done, david tennant intensely wonderful, the usual talented uk cast plus beautiful coastal scenery-a definite recommend for mystery fans
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Wow, Brilliant Read.  Cannot get enough of Jeffrey Archer.  Wonderful Author.  Definitely recommend this book, this series and authour.  Wow.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Sometimes it's lots of fun and sometimes it's so frustrating that you want to quite . .  but . . . find yourself picking it up again and again and again!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book-- I could have read it in a day but wanted to savor it for as long as possible so I slowed my reading and finished it in about a week. It is a Young Adult fiction. I did not expect adult content and was happy not to have it there. The story is heartfelt and I love (and miss) all the characters.<br />I bought the Kindle version and got a deal to buy the audiobook as well. I don't normally do this, but just about two days after I finished reading it, I started listening to it all over again!  I guess I wasn't done enjoying it.  I only give it a half star off 5 because it didn't quite have the &#34;tell all my friends to read this book NOW&#34; quality-- but I really did enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this was a great book i recommend it to other of u like suzanie Collins.please share to others
B0036TGT3E|4.0|Great movie, disk just needed a cleaning<br />It was used so that comes with the territory.<br />I have a Memorex cleaner.<br />it has been used to clean and repair brand new discs as well.
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|Couldn't even figure out how to train troops or access a help button.  What a waste of programming.  Back to the drawing board
1476727651|5.0|I almost knocked off a star for having to wait all this time to find out what happened to Danny. Then as I read it I realized this was not a story Stephen King could have told twenty years ago. Not *this* story in any case. And I like this modern Mr King's take on things much more than many of his &#34;middle period&#34; novels. Yes, it was worth the wait. Nicely done. And, dare I say it -- there's room for more stories for new players introduced in this novel. I hope those tales get told sooner than later.
B009C30K4W|5.0|If you know the story and have seen a production of West Side Story then no review is really needed.  With one viewing you will be humming the songs.  By your second viewing you will be singing the songs out loud in your car.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an awesome book with a sad ending, but I know that there's going to be more in the next book.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|You can't ever go wrong with Maroon 5. This CD is a classic and although I wasn't familiar with all of the songs, all are truly great.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great action flick. Typical performance by Tom Cruise. Movie kept you on you toes trughout.  It had a very good supporting cast.
B0093WVND4|4.0|This book is truly fantastic just like Mr. Fox.I love how clever the animals are. The animals are tremendous just like the author is
B00E34A9FU|5.0|If you consider yourself a Dead Head or even just a casual listener of the Good Old Grateful Dead, this is a must watch or rather owned show.  I have had my official/unofficial trading copy for years and have never tired of it.  Do not expect a spectacular light show, choreography or any thing rehearsed.  This was filmed/recorded in the early 1970's.  Just expect the original and best jam band to ever play an instrument performing for your enjoyment during a time when life was just so much simpler.  Oh and yes, I have put to rest my old grainy, almost B&W copy for this brand new shiny edition.  This is well worth the purchase price which is less than the typical concert ticket these days.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Now,I got this book for school and I  all of a sudden got hooked great book great stories from rickrioden best author ever
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I am one of those whom would listen to this artist and not so much as buy her CD, but her song It's Friday Night makes you get up and dance and Wide awake. This CD is great. I love her.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This was a good first book in a series. Heat and Rook's relationship is off to a realistic start. It did go a little fast though.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Excellent CD!  He reminds me of top talents of years' past... He is young ... He will only get better... I can't wait to see what he does next!

B000H305U0|5.0|Play this CD and see how your mood and anyone around you mood changes for the GOOD. A MUST BUY.
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|I am using several of these listed videos for my mythology class to add to the readings in the textbook and of course my students love Brad Pitt as well as how the movie helps them understand the readings.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|An opportunity to reassess a period in Dylan's history that has not been well regarded, and better understand his vision..
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stephen never disappoints! 11/22/63 is an awesome History, Adventure, and Love Story all wrapped in one! Phenomenal. When does the movie hit theaters?? =)
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Such a good story. Dave Grohl did an excellent job with this. I'd highly recommend seeing it and buy the album &#34;Real to Reel&#34;.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Another artist I wasn't familiar with until I heard the song, LET HER GO and bought the CD and I am so glad I did and you won't be disappointed if you do either.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The story of Auggie is told from all perspectives, his, and the people who are part of his world.  The reader learns how Auggie, at the age of 10,  has devised coping mechanisms to deal with people's reactions when they see his face for the first time. Auggie  was born with a rare birth phenomenon that caused his facial features to be distorted.  In his first year of public school as a fifth grader, Auggie endures the cruelties of some of his classmates, but is also empowered by the kindness of others.<br />I gave Wonder a five star rating, not only because it will make a lasting impression on readers of all ages, but also because a higher rating was not available!  This is an especially good book for kids and adults, and is a launching pad for discussing the many lessons offered.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 books in this series are highly addicting. I can only pray for more to come!  It's interesting to switch to Christians view
B001BR3P0S|5.0|A classic.  Recently, my 18 year old niece asked for this DVD for her birthday.  So, the story lives on through the millenial generation.  The Breakfast Club's message lives. BE Yourself at all costs, but value the significance of others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing this game and it is very addictive. I would recommend everyone play it .
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun! Fun! Fun!  I enjoyed playing this game.  It is very challenging.  It keep my mind alert and active especially at my age.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love spider solitare even tho it don't love me, its one of my fav quiet time card games! Try it
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was an awesome movie set with tons of extras. Hours of fun! Super cool 3-D experience for the whole family!
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|This album is polarizing and either you will absolutely love it or hate it. I personally enjoyed the album because of the released tracks New Slaves, Black Skinheads and the final track Bound 2 but the rest of the album is not as boundary pushing as a lot of people make it out to be. Death Grips comes to mind when listening to this cd except they do it significantly better with more impacting production and lyrics.<br /><br />Good Tracks<br />-Bound 2<br />-New Slaves<br />-Black Skinheads<br /><br />Every other track is unimpressive but may grow on you. An example is his track I am a God feat God (God goes in on this track btw jk) which is not a good track but it's a guilty pleasure to listen to.
0394826817|5.0|The stories were great and taught many manners by example. My three year old loves books and she loved to hear this from her Granny!
0062073192|4.0|You know you see the boys looking in John's Journal so it was neat to have it in my hands.  I can follow it when I relook at the scenses where they look into the book and it also lets me know how John felt about his boys.  He loved both of them so much.  I really liked this book
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like soltaire and have always played games like this cause I usually game alone so its a game you can play during quiet times  or waiting in the doctors office
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|I wouldn't know because It won't let me play without purchasing something.  ????  Would very much like to play the game.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Everyone said the 2nd book was better but I feel it was 50/50 but I like that both books leave u in anticipation.. Def a good read..
B004YW4L5K|3.0|Though the premise that Americans have forsaken the old Norse, Greek, Roman gods for the new gods of TV and sex is fascinating, that tale was hijacked and a picaresque adventure substituted. I was disappointed.  The author's treatment of &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; shows his appreciation of the absurd, but the devil in his details knotted his yarn irretrievably.
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|The acting is very good, especially that of the two detectives.  The mystery is solid English stuff -- the right blend of realistic yet sinister.  But eight episodes?  Too long.  Would have been perfect at four, with a little less soap opera, subplots and slo-mo tracking shots.  Prime Suspect was the perfect &#34;long&#34; mystery length in this genre; even a two part &#34;Touch of Frost&#34; could drag or get overloaded with subplots.  Don't know how there could be a Season 2 with so much closure for the characters in this one . . .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am addicted to this game. It is a great way to pass time and makes you think as well. Get it now
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book is by far my favorite, much better than the second and third one. I really wasn't a fan of the third one at all, too much shift in the way she tells the story. Anyway, the first one is amazing and compelling and I had an extremely hard time putting this book down. You are introduced to the characters for the first time and the author does an amazing job on really describing these characters and bringing them to life. My favorite characters (Peeta and Haymitch) really make the story better for me. They are invoking and their personality traits are so distinct and their own, that it makes the story all that much better.<br />If you haven't read the series yet, it is about 12 different districts (all more progressively poor than the next it seems) and Katniss (main character) is a part of district 12 (the coal mining district) and must go to the Capitol (very prestigious  city) to compete in the hunger games. It's a lot like Running Man or Battle Royale if you have seen either. Definitely a good read, I highly recommend it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Had this app for almost 2 weeks and love it! Easy to use great features and fun skins to match almost any taste! Buy this one you will not be unsatisfied!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I took my youngest son to see this in the theaters because there are some movies that you need to see on the big screen first & this is one of them.  But, when it became available to buy, I snatched it up right away & couldn't hardly wait the 2 days free shipping I get with my Prime membership.<br /><br />I've watched the DVD's, both regular & Blu-Ray a few times with my nephew or just by myself.  It doesn't disappoint being seen on a TV screen instead of the theater but that might be because I've already saw it in the theater.  I do recommend this movie to any Iron Man fan along with any fan of Marvel in general.  You can see that there is going to be a sequel after the movie is over & I can't remember if that was in the theater release or not.  But it does give you an idea of the character that will be the bad guy if there is a sequel.  But that doesn't take away from how good this movie is.<br /><br />This is going to be one of those DVD's that I will watch over & over as time goes along.  Just like I am doing with the Avengers & the Thor movies as well as the Fantastic Four's & X-Men ones also.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Easy  and fast read but nothing too exciting here. It has a little Catholic undertones of paying for your mistakes.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I love cats and this was a very inspirational story. Cats just seem to know where they are needed. Some people don't realize how smart and loving cats really are.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|In a court room, it is always desirable to hear eye-witness accounts before rendering a decision.  Likewise, in an event as earth shaking as the take-down of Osama bin Laden, it is no less desirable to have eye-witness accounts.  No Easy Day is a riveting retelling of the events leading up to that mission as well as the mission itself.  A good read for me...a page turner.  I didn't want to put it down.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Nice tool. Some time take some more time but overall very good and nice tool provide, and also free .
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|best one yet cant wait for next adventure graphics are cool music awesome and puzzles challenging and fun well worth every penny
B00BV5FVR0|5.0|Wow, what a ride.  This is madness, but a wonderful read.  A great finish to an amazing trilogy.  Thoroughly enjoyed.
B00ED44HLC|3.0|For fifty-whatever dollars you would believe they can throw in the CD's along with the MP3's.  Record sounds amazing, the second half is somewhat experimental, but not throw-away as the critics would have you believing.  If you own the first part on vinyl, then save yourself a hassle and just order the back half separate.  The only difference between this box set and the individual albums is the fancy overbox for the two albums.<br /><br />If I come across something making the BOX SET a BETTER BUY, I will amend this review.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great app! Puts me right to sleep every time...and is easy to use. I am so glad I downloaded it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that minion rush is great because it is great for kids. It is also great for road trips in the car. It's fun and easy
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Like most others I enjoy the Kindle Android app, using it often, and it has worked well on my LG Optimus Net Android 2.4 phone until today.  I permitted the update to version 4.2.0.54 and the app began to load, froze, and eventually the screen turned black.  I tried three times with the same result.  My understanding is the app is supposed to work on Android 2.3 or later, so hope there is some new flaw in version 4.2.0.54 that will be fixed.<br /><br />Neither the Android Play store nor this store seems to offer the previous version that had been working flawlessly.  I was able to locate a version 4.1 APK package at an obscure Android site  and have that working now.  It does not have the new book location info at the bottom margin, and of course doesn't have any of my book data, but at least it works.  I'll try the NEXT version of this app again in the hope it will work on my unit.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The characters are believable and very well developed, and I love the Australian setting.  It brings into light issues of morality, forgiveness and guilt, and the answers given are not so black and white as we might otherwise believe.  I found myself thinking about it long after finishing the book.
B00CL151G4|4.0|I had never watched the show on TV.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first and second season and plan to continue watching it.
B00CATONCA|5.0|great price, accurate shipping, great product overall. Got it for a gift for my boyfriend and he really enjoyed it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is wonderful. Very very addicting game. Sad right now because I can not play it because of new update.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|I loved Sarah's first album &#34;Song Up In Her Head&#34; and I really liked her second album &#34;Follow Me Down.&#34; After listening to this album about a dozen times I have to say that the songs on it are more enjoyable to me than the songs on &#34;Follow Me Down&#34; and almost as good as the songs on &#34;Song Up In Her Head.&#34; There isn't a song on the album that I don't like and there are a few that I love.<br /><br />Two things are missing from this album that are present on the previous two, neither of which are negatives at all. Most noticeably is the lack of an instrumental only song which may indicate Sarah's shift from an instrumentalist who also sings to a singer who also plays an instrument. The second thing I think is missing is a song that breaks from Sarah's &#34;style.&#34; On her first album that song was &#34;Shankill Butchers&#34; and on her second album that was &#34;The Tourist&#34; both of which were excellent songs. On this album I think that her cover of &#34;The Book of Right On&#34; may be that song, but it is done in a style I would say is all her own. Sarah does an incredible job of making songs sound beautiful in my opinion. For a prime example of that, compare Tom Waits version of &#34;Come On Up To The House&#34; to Sarah's version.<br /><br />All being said, this is my favorite album of the year and is an excellent album from Sarah Jarosz.
1885167776|4.0|I have owned my own business for the past 10 years.  Every year I start out to meet my goals.  By the end of the first quarter (first month) my focus was in 20 different directions.  Gary and Jay's book has enabled me to develope the habit and discipline to focus on The One Thing!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Great for families, my 10 and 13 year old love it! Awesome one liners. A must watch comedy, very funny.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I wasn't expecting this. Not your typical horror thriller and full of neat surprises. Highly recommended for a change in the vampire genre.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is a awesome movie. And I love it in 3D. I like having all three copies. Anyone who is a fan of the Alien movies this is a must see.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my husband, who freaked out when he saw what it was.<br />It took him about 2 days (really, 2 evenings after works) and he loved every minute of it.<br />Missing him for a few nights was worth it, considering how hard he works for his family.  He has since put it on display in our home and raves about it to every other husband that comes over.  Several of my girlfriends are playfully angry with me now since they are being pressured to purchase this not-so-inexpensive gift.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Excellent fit with USB, and doesn't heat up like my first cord. Also the battery seems to charge fasterwith new cord.
B00CY5Y3A2|5.0|BELINDA CARLISLE - Always great to see live and I must have seen her live in some of these 80's Regeneration Festivals in the L.A. Area & Orange County Fair Solo more than I've seen her with the Go-Go's perform live.

B00FFVB2DI|5.0|While my wife and I don't watch a lot of TV, we have found this show to consistency have the funniest stories, wittiest dialogue and the most lovable characters on any show of recent memory.  And most importantly, it doesn't insult your intelligence.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is my number one favorite 3D movie. I love the colors and I love the characters. It's such a good story.  Great for the whole family.
0694013013|5.0|He loves to try to mimick what I do when reading this book.  His favorite is &#34;I can raise my shoulders like a buffalo&#34; (raise your shoulders several times) &#34;Can you do it? &#34; (He tries to do it)  &#34;I can do it!&#34;  And he laughs.<br />Super cute book.  I recommend this to any baby/toddler showing an interest in books.
B00000K2UX|4.0|The addition songs make the soundtrack even better to listen to. They should have been included the first time since they were part of an awesome movie.
B00003CWOL|5.0|I had this film on an old VHS tape, and it was getting pretty worn out from constant viewing. Was so glad to find it on DVD. Kevin Smith has a deft touch when it comes to satire, and the film is surprisingly reverent. If you like this movie, I would reccomend the novel LAMB by Christopher Moore.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love Alicia's character.  She is imaginative and innovative, yet humble.  She is a strong woman with solid convictions and dignity.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|It's a great MIC for $20 and I have heard some terrific sound online from it, but if you aren't using a $100 external audio recorder to record into then you lose a lot of it's potential.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Bad things can happen to good people. Circumstances can change our lives in an instant. This book shows us that we should not be so quick to judge others, we don't know the whole story. If all judges were required to spend a week in lockup, they might be more educated toward sentencing. Women seem to be more harshly punished for crimes that society has forced upon them in order to provide for their families and themselves. This book shows that their is little real help given to help them to help them for their future when they leave prison.
1451650728|4.0|David Mack is an amazing writer!  He keeps the tradition going beyond the TV shows.  I love the way subtly ( and sometimes not so subtly) he refers to Rush and their music in just about every book he's written.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so addictive.  You lose track of time so while playing.  I will have to look for more similar game.
030746363X|1.0|I think Tim Ferriss wrote this book to test some limits, namely how much utter fiction he could present as fact and have people believe it. Nothing I've tried from this book has proven the least bit true. He sure does know how to market though.
B001KL0WJW|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was 9!!! I was SO happy to find it on Amazon. Thx for bringing back the memories!!!!!!
B003AVPV1O|5.0|This splitter works great every time, no issues! I would recommend this product it is a good buy for the price.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Is this really what we are coming to in this country? I mean come on have you idiots ever seen Cool hand Luke. They must have paid Brad Pitt so many millions of dollars to be in this at best B movie. You are a moron if you have any interest in this. Just go outside and kill yourself do us all a favor.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great read with characters you'll still be thinking about long after the chapter is over. My favorite from this 3 novels so far.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Interesting play along with puzzle play makes this a fun brain teaser. I onlystartedabout an hourago but so farso good. Hopefully this willcontinue
B007THA4FI|5.0|Agreed with others, that there is a lot of characters to &#34;remember.&#34; As you invest your time into this book, it becomes fairly easy to remember everyone. Excellent story!
B001QC9PSO|5.0|Go ninja go ninja go! This movie, the sequel to TMNT, features a closing scene with Vanilla Ice.  Enough said.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Overall a slow read; Interesting start;  Predictable plot; the Epilogue should have been weaved into the story; I was disappointed.
B00FKSIYJ6|1.0|I wish I could understand why this program is not playing through the ROKU box.  I get a high squeak and then no sound.  Picture fine, but no sound.  First poor product I've bought from Amazon VOD, but I'm not sure I'll be buying anymore.  Thanks Amazon for giving a reason to look at your competitors for my video on demand.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Loved the book, but like most Stephen King's I feel like I invested a lot of time into the characters..only to have it wrap up fairly quickly, leaving me disappointed. Worth reading though.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Love the slack key guitar - transports me to Hawaii!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My wife and I watched this when it first came out on DVD. I was s surprised that it was good enough to keep an adult laughing his socks off! This is great for families to enjoy a very good laugh - no matter how old you are!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie with great style and actors. I loved the cinematography. It was very well done with creative style. Leonardo has been very professional and very convincing in his role.
B000IDCJK8|5.0|Classic tale of a wronged man exacting his revenge upon those who betrayed him. Funny yet deadly serious. Well done.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I like the opportunity to leave comments, but seriously object to a word requirement for comments.  Please revise this part of Amazon. ;-)
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I am getting used to it but it is difficult to navigate it, sometimes it doesn't come up and I had a lot of trouble signing on and getting it verified I still think it is good but very difficult
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Just what my little girl wanted😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😃😃😚thanks for the low price and fast shipping this was the first item I have ordered other than books very impressed
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Absolute classic about young peoples' hi-jinx. It has it all--pranks, skirt-chasing, drag racing and drama. The soundtrack is great as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like the opportunity to leave comments, but seriously object to a word requirement for comments.  Please revise this part of Amazon. ;-)
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Not much to say about the app. It is ok if you play Candy Crush Saga. I have no opinion one way or the other.
B005MVLI8A|5.0|Nirvana is the greatest rock band ever! This album is a must as it is the album that brought this iconic band to the mainstream...
B0049MAXQG|5.0|The Exorcist is so frightening because it could actually happen. This isn't some dumb slasher movie--this is the real deal.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I like the opportunity to leave comments, but seriously object to a requirement for comments.  Please revise this part of Amazon. ;-)
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Very good movies, can't wait until the fourth one comes out. Five stars for the autobots! Great price for three blu rays
B006S053K8|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good coming-of-age story, but it irks me that Hollywood has to always depict suburbia as this environment of horrible, self-absorbed people who constantly ruin their kids' lives. I guess it's just Hollywood folk think suburbia is just like they are.
B007DIQC90|5.0|My Head is an Animal is a wonderful album all the way through.  You may know some of the songs from the radio, but there are many more worth the listen.  Definitely worth purchasing.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Great family movie.  Loved the character Gru and how the three little girls changed his life.  Very funny and sweet movie.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I didn't like the ending & I thought it wasn't as enticing as the last two books... other than that it was good...
B008Y212PI|5.0|Addictive game. I couldn't put it down once I started. Reminds me of the Mine game that used to come with Windows... only better
B00CHVJI08|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies that has come out within the past years! The toy is a cute little Belt that can hold on to things with velcro!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to those with children :)
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is a &#34;must read&#34;  for any of us that want proceed further along our spiritual path.  Thank You to author Paolo Coelho.
B000QGAU4E|4.0|Children of Men presents an interesting fictional story about the near future, where governments have collapsed, the world is grey and not much fun, and women have become infertile.<br /><br />The story is what mainly carries the movie on his back, with a few twists, and small amount of movie clichés to raise the dramatic effect. The good is that director Alfonso Cuarón's presentation has a very unique style and the characters developed and believable. It is not easy to portray a fictional future but the actors have done a good job as well.<br /><br />Altogether, it's a good movie, worth watching.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|I would have given it (5) stars if it wasn't so slow in parts. Gatsby's character lacked a little spark that would have made him interesting. I think I compared it too much with the newer release of 2013.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was another good read by Hosseini.  I have read all his books, each one giving insights about life in Afghanistan and the various problems encountered.  This one was a little disjointed - jumping from time period to time period and continent to continent which explains the 4 rather than 5 stars.  I will read more of his books when published!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love the legal world and all of it's ins and outs, dirt,cutting and romance around town. It all happens in my Chicago. I studied law for a while in San Francisco and there was a lot That I can use today. I thought it was about a food wife &#34;duh&#34;.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|First saw this in a bar in Phuket, Thailand in the late 90's. I was waiting for a plane and was transfixed for the entire afternoon. So glad I reconnected with this incredible experience.
B00785P2QC|5.0|A really fun game to play. Has lots of different challenges to complete. I would recommend downloading it and it is free.
B00D28TNT6|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums of the year. FB have mastered a minimalist yet rich approach to \\"noise\\" - there's just so much room to get lost in on this album.<br /><br />Track ratings:<br /><br />Brainfreeze - 10/10<br />Year Of The Dog - 9/10<br />The Red Wing - 9/10<br />Sentients - 10/10<br />Prince's Prize - 9.5/10<br />Stalker - 10/10<br />Hidden XS - 9/10<br /><br />Overall grade: 9.5/10 - 4.75 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love love LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!! It super fun! So upgraded. I would recommend to friend and family. I love it!!!!
B00FG5E03W|5.0|I went into this movie thinking I'd get my geek on with some sci-fi.  Little did I expect that it'd be a good &#34;night in&#34; movie with the wife as well.
B00CL151G4|5.0|I first saw Jonny Lee Miller in Eli Stone and was very impressed with him. He is even better in Elementary. There was some question as to Lucy Lui in the role of Watson, and I was sort of con at first, but after having watched the first season, I have become a fan. I really did not think that an update of Sherlock Holmes would be any good, but it has turned out to be one of my big favorites--I think it has a lot to do with Jonny Lee. It would be great if the writers and others involved with the show would include something like the Baker Street Irregulars in this new up-dated version.
145211207X|5.0|I just loved it! This book has a full of awesome drawings and much more. The Chronicle books' &#34;the art of&#34; series never disappoints me.
B004811PMO|3.0|The film stopped playing a few times, even though I thought my internet was solid. Not sure why, I can only assume it was a problem with the site.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Made by Google and comes in official packaging. It's high quality and stylish. Wouldn't use the nexus 4 without it.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|just like their older material. original lyrics and music. always sonething cutting edge and contemporary  can' t wait to see them again in concert
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even know how to describe it.. Dark hilarity? Sadness, true love, pain, laughter, cancer, teenagers who are smarter than most adults.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|THIS game was very good and very well updated rosters it was a bit pricy I have to admit but it was a great overall game The LeBron James Modes are very good I highly recommend this app to any Basketball fan
0763644765|5.0|This book is so funny for both adults and kids!  What kid wouldn't love it?!  The cardboard pages are easy for my 2 year old to turn.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|All the greatness of the vinyl I bought 40 years ago with alternates and other songs that fit in the same groove. Great stuff!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book.  I really enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down. First time I read a Sylvia Day book.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It was challenging but not too challenging.<br />I particularly liked the fact that the final shape matched the shape of the puzzle.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys .Who wouldn't like them .They are one of best band of old time on to the day now. They are the best in music. They are great Artist.
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|This card is great and met all my expectations.  The design is slick, the packaging is well put together, and the card performs like a beast in my rig.  Its quieter than my super quiet system fans and my silent psu all while staying super cool.  I have a 1080p monitor and I can crank anything up with this no problem.  There aren't really any extras in the package but considering the card already comes with an awesome backplate, custom cooler, and the board is all aftermarket design there is nothing to complain there.<br /><br />Edit: I've tested it playing Crysis 3, Metro: last light, Battlefield 3, and the Witcher 2 - with everything maxed at 1080p I can sometimes get temps as high as 58°C...lol.  Fan is still only at 50% with those temps and I can't hear a thing.<br /><br />WARNING: Amazon for some reason is excluding this card from the free game promo even though the 770 version and all other 700 series gtx's they sell include it.  I contacted customer service and they didn't even read my information just sent me a generic response saying they are sorry instead of looking into it.  I'm convinced that someone just made a mistake on their product page.  Shipping was fast, but I don't recommend buying this particular card from Amazon until they add the promo (which NVIDIA and ASUS both advertise and Amazon supports with all other models).
B000FC10MU|2.0|American Gods had potential.  It progressed so that you understood the protagonist's feelings and his path in life.  It was slow; almost like being sucked into someone else's depressed state of being.  I was mostly disappointed in the development of this book.  The character development was very well done, but completely one-sided.  The climax of the book leaves the reader wondering why they invested thought and time.  I'd rather sit at a diner and eat pancakes or omelets and read a newspaper than read this book again.  I could even flirt with the waitress unsuccessfully and still have a better time than the main character.  Neil Gaiman has done very well in my opinion.  Sandman is great.  So is Neverwhere.  But he missed with American Gods.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Have long heard about this show and after a long wait to catch it, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Recently settled into a long flight from Chicago to London and was pleasantly surprised to find the Airline had on offer the first 4 episodes via on demand for viewing. Watched all four back to back and as soon as I returned home bought the remaining ones from Amazon for my Kindle Fire.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|If you thought The Da Vinci Code was good, read this thriller! Dan Brown knows how to write exciting thrillers. Highly recommended.
B002GIBVV6|3.0|Entertaining for 12 and younger but just ok, that's about it - good acting what else can we say? Smile
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I love It. thank you. I love It. thank you<br />and wonderful and stylish<br /> I love this item and price.<br />Cheap and beautiful<br />Everything is fine<br />I really loved it.<br />My friend also said good-looking and beautiful. So far so good will buy again. I recommend buying this product
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|For 2012 \\"The Lorax\\" was a box office hit and was written with some clever wit.<br /><br />Many film adaptations seem to fail, but the writers stayed true to Dr. Suess' original tale.<br /><br />A well selected voice cast made the film a joy, along with a subplot of a friendship between a girl and a boy.<br /><br />Unpleasant consequences a character will eventually see when he asks in a song titled \\"How Bad Can I Be?\\"<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I highly recommend you watch this movie someday!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik messanger is a great social media app and it has been performing outstandingly and all of a sudden it wont let me log on. It says &quot;oops this seems to be taking longer than usual. Try again in a little bit&quot;. Please fix this.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Don't like that you have to buy coins and wait to play if you don't . Cancelled it out after first day.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|In this book, the behavior of 12 teens and 1 adult interconnect and result in a suicide.  Hannah Baker moves to a new area and knows no one in her high school.  During the summer, she encounters  a boy who kisses her but who exaggerates the encounter tarnishing her reputation.  As the year progresses, more people interact with her, and with each encounter, she becomes more and more despairing.  Kindness and decency are in short supply in her school, and the readers will wish she could meet a few strong, observant, kind people.
B00358ESI4|3.0|Decent film but far from dazzling. Saving Private Ryan was a 5 star film, I would recommend that long before this film.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter is enchanted with the movies.  She is other person when she saw the movie.  She like it very much.
B008Y212PI|1.0|Did not play with it for me the most different types of the game.again for me the games to play with this game to be able to get the most.Did not play long at all
B009OYTIXS|5.0|Very Good show! This show has Great acting, great casting, great directing. Lots of action.<br />If you miss Smallville. Try this.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Howleen's hair and clothing is so fashionable! My daughter's best friend calls her &#34;Howleen&#34; I highly recommend this doll! Her journal, pet and outfit is so detailed and high quality! You will not be disappointed in this one!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Absolutely love the series... Second season doesn't disappoint , nor does season three for that matter!! Absolutely loved the books and although some things, as always, have been changed for the series, I still very highly recommend this series,  the books, et al.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loved it! Great game and challenging<br />Enjoyed moving from room to room to solve mysteries and puzzles. Also mini games were fun and challenging and you had to find pieces to complete monogamy which added additional challenge
0152023984|5.0|Love it
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|This doll shimmers! So beautiful! The colors are vibrant and the detail. Mattel hit a home run with this doll! The dust bunny has button eyes! So cute. Wish the outfit came in adult sizes! The shoes are ADORABLE! Twyla makes my daughter smile and that is priceless. Avid MH fans - do not let this one get away!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I am crushing a bit on this series. I usually don't get sucked into things, but this one has me.
1931559317|5.0|Excellent and useful. Will be of help to any amateur astronomer. The only thing I don't like is that the covers are soft, they shouldn't be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game is the best game I every played in my life and I love it because it is fun
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Ken Follett brilliantly walks his readers into WWI with viewpoints from strong characters in all the major countries.  I could imagine being there.  He wove favoritism cleverly to the working class and exposed the rich as aware, capable of knowledge but foolish decision makers, callously disregarding those who would shape the future.  He showed how the Russian revolution started with mayhem, led to passion, and ended with indulgences.  I really enjoyed this read and have the next book queued so there is no lapse in the story.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I am crushing a bit on this series. I usually don't get sucked into things, but this one has me.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The game is so awesome, I love the &quot;pork side&quot; option. I hesitated in getting the app because I can be tricked into buying things and I saw that there was in app purchasing. I had no problems with the purchasing because its just like any angry birds game, you can beat the levels without the extra birds, they are just nice to have. This is a nice change on angry birds, which was starting to become a little bit repetitive. Rovio needs to make more levels!! I beat all the levels put out in just one day, and I cant wait for more.
