B007L3BMGA|1.0|I don't think I have ever read a book as bad as Fifty Shades of Gray. For the life of me I don't understand the hype. Poorly written, bad grammar, weak characters and weaker story and altogether quite sickening really.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I think this game has a lot of potential as the fast paced customers really make you utilize problem-solving skills.  For older children it offers excellent math concepts so you can analyze how successful your day was.  However, it doesn't offer much by way of improving your cafe without purchasing items with cash..  As a result, even when you have a good day you're not earning very many coins to purchase extra chairs, tables, workers etc.
B00A77II0U|5.0|love the game...I love these types of games in general but this is the only game I replay just to see the story again
0765367351|5.0|I really liked this book. Expanded Universe stuff is usually pretty terrible, or too contrived to make sense to the average consumer, but this one was damn good and totally accessible. I even lent it to my mother- who plays no video games- and she thought it was good. So bleh.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|LIked the sounds and &#34;reality&#34; of this game. Makes you feel engaged, but is easy enough for a 5 year old.
B00197POXG|5.0|If you like Dr. Quinn and wholesome family movies, this set is a must. Also, includes her movies which is a nice added bonus!
B005LAII1C|5.0|was a funny funny movie got it based on the hype and it was worth it, if u think you want to buy it buy it
055357342X|5.0|Everything George RR Martin writes is a chunk of magic spam sizzling on my brain pan, filling my mind kitchen with delightful smells.
B00917IQFY|4.0|I have to echo many of the other reviewers.  I was initially somewhat disappointed after hearing some of these tracks, but after listening to the entire album through, it grows on you and it's really good.  These guys are in their 60's now and it's refreshing that their not trying to rock like its 30 years ago.  To me the Rumour provide good tasteful accompaniment to a solid collection of GPs songs.  It's interesting to hear how the different instruments weave in and out and the rhythm section is very solid.  Nice job and I hope it's not just a one off project but the re-start of this great unit.
B00011RPB0|5.0|On Time, Great Condition!! Thanx! The advantage of finding this quality movie with great reviews made a great gift for some Bill Murray fans.

1451648537|5.0|What a book!  It is well researched, and with the mastery of the author, Walter Isaacson, conveys a rare and  insightful look at a genius in our own time.<br />It was a fascinating read, and, once started, I couldn't put it down.<br />This was a book so worth reading and so worth having as a permanent book in my library.<br /><br />Geraldine Mott
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It's rare that a story can surprise me, but this one did, quite a few times. I mean, the plot is outrageous but it certainly is never boring!
B008NW67IQ|5.0|This is a great CD that I purchased for my daughter for a Christmas gift.  However, it will not play in her car CD player!  No problem playing it on a laptop computer, though.  She is very disappointed that she cannot play it in the car.  We are wondering if it is possible to exchange it for another copy.
034580404X|5.0|What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said about this trilogy??  I can say that because of these books, I haven't stopped reading!  I loved this trilogy so much and am anticipating the movie.  I hope it will be just as mind blowing!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I am not going to give any details about this film except to urge you to see it.  If you have a soul, see this film. If you get overwhelmed and are driven toward hopelessness by all the toxic news of the world, see this film.  It stirs the soul at so many levels.  Not knowing the story ahead of time added to my experience of the film, so you will get no spoilers from me.<br /><br />What begins as a fascinating story builds slowly and transforms into stunning, exhilarating, soul-evocative magic. I was left wanting to see it again and again, to go home and write all those stirrings into fuller consciousness, to take friends to see it whenever possible, to buy the DVD for myself and as a gift for the people I love.<br /><br />Do NOT miss this. I haven't been this inspired by a film since I saw Gandhi in the '70s.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Is that sometimes people ignore the fact that this book is overwhelmingly depressing. But still an interesting style to read.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I know this is a freebie, however, the pop-up of commercials (and some could be very close to r-rating) is very bothersome, to the point I am ready to delete from my Kinkle.

B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This is a movie you can get wrapped up in and I love when it depicts some history. The actors are well casted for their characters. Especially, Tom Hardy as &#34;Bain.&#34;  You immediately recognize he is a force to be reckon with.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the humor and religious/spiritual perspectives. Fantastic yet mostly believable survival story. Hard to put down. A compulsive read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|okay I gave it 3 stars because the story is pretty good, but the writing is... well... not so good. I had a hard time reading it because of the way it was written. It was... juvinile. I don't see why this book is a world wide sensation. I hated the &#34;down theres&#34; and the 500 gasps on every page. And the pharase &#34;my inner sex goddess,&#34; was way over used. I don't know, the story is alright, but the book could have been so much better. I skipped a lot of pages. I don't plan on reading the other books either.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Not only that this browser if fast, but it is excellent in the way they use the tabs and bookmarks. I love that it's free and also the best surfing browser there is on iPhone, Android, and all Smartphones.
B006ZS4HTG|4.0|However, my daughter said she preferred &#34;boy&#34; Legos because they were more interesting.  She is currently building Harry Potter's Diagon Alley.  Good intro to Legos.  It's a small set and $20 was too much to pay for it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great for all ages! Even my grandma plays it on kindle! Greatest game ever! Very entertaining and fun. I play solitaire all the time!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I love reading the old novels, and to be able to get them at a reasonable price is amazing.

Thanks Amazon!!

B00ANT9MZW|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty is the very definition of postmodernism: watching a movie about something that happened barely a year ago. While watching it, it felt weird knowing how recent the actual event was. But at the same time it felt very natural since that is becoming a common thing now-a-days. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. Some people accuse all but the last forty minutes of this movie to be very boring. They couldn't be more wrong. It was gripping from start to finish. The dialogue was extremely well written. The scenery and situations felt authentic (whether or not they were is another story). The musical score invoked just the right mood. This movie has also been accused of being Pro-Obama. I didn't feel like that was the case. I felt like it just told the story of how Bin Laden was found from the perspective of the people actually making it happen. If anything, it made our President look weak for not allowing torture. I'm not necessarily stating my opinion, I'm just talking about what the movie would make one think. All the actors did a great job, especially Jessica Chastain, who was very convincing in her strung-out obsession with finding Bin Laden. I was a little surprised they got known actors to be some of the SEALS. But they all did fantastic. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in good movies based on true events. A note on content: This movie is rated R. So going in to it, one should know that it does depict some torture, including water boarding. Also, there are tons of \\"F\\" words. However, I did not feel that the language or the torture were gratuitous or detracted too much. There is also some male rear nudity with an extremely brief silhouette of genitals. Overall, this movie was excellent and I would highly recommend it to those who would be comfortable with the subject matter and the way it is covered. It is definitely a pro-America movie that justifies its' position by the content it depicts. This movie reinforced my pride in being an American, it's just sad that these things are happening in the world today.
0930289234|4.0|The book itself is a great one if you're looking for looking for a graphic novel like this.  My only complaint is that the cover was slightly bent because of the way it was packaged.  Otherwise, if you're a fan of the movie and you want to know where it all started, this is a good buy.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This one stands out as just ordinary Solitaire app. Nothing really bad about it, but not anything really great about it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book keeps you wanting more! I recommend the Hunger Games Series to anyone...looking forward to the movie!!! Great read!!!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Pitch Perfect was very upbeat, and the musical score kept me humming away long after the movie ended. The movie was full of great one-liners and the acting by the entire cast was great. This is a feel-good movie and will be one I will always reach for when I need a little boost.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I love this game.A can not get this game out of my head! This game is soooooooooooooo good. You should get it!!!!!!!:)

B000F8O35U|1.0|This item advertised as new in box sealed with cover. When I opened it I could tell that it was a duplicate not original. When I went to add the disney movie reward code it was confirmed by the site saying the code was already used. This is a bootleg.

B005LAII80|5.0|Any real action movie lover is gonna love this movie! The simple story, the gory violence, and the great gun toting scenes is all I need to enjoy this great action flick. Anybody giving this a one or two star is not a real action movie fan. This movie was raw and the story wasn't over done it was simple and it was very entertaining! I just got my copy on blu ray and I can already say that this will be a cult classic!
B008XG1X18|1.0|Won't load anything,  keeps freezing and won't show anything at all.  Would like to use if they fix it it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Pretty good game. Interesting story, hidden objects, moderately challenging puzzles and not to short. Definitely a recommendation even if you choose not to get the full version.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore has his best songs on this album. Every song is a stereo thumper. It is a must buy you won't regret it
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|Even though this movie was not as good as the previous Insidious it is still worth watching. It has enough scares and spooky imagery to give you a few frights and there are a few scenes that are really scary! I would suggest this on blu ray and while watching it make sure all the lights are turned off just to give you that extra effect. Definitely worth checking out!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I saw no reason for the cutting. Hard to tell who was the craziest' the villian or the hero. Odd book
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Absolutely love this cd! Would recommend to anyone who likes metal!! There are at least 2 songs so far I can't get enough of.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This really keeps you hoping for the best for them as a couple it's believable and inspiring I want to read it again

B007JVJ3C4|3.0|Condition and quality of the disc was great. The movie itself wasn't very good. Definitely not worth buying in 3d.

B009HELT3C|5.0|This was a great movie. I will be buying this on Blue Ray. . . . . . . .
1452111014|5.0|Great quality, although I wish there were more literature inside it. I understand it's an art book but other similar books such as &#34;The Art of The Lion King&#34; were at least half pictures, half reading with really interesting facts about the production of the movie. Either way, it's lovely and I'm very happy with it.
B008602KQI|5.0|If you read the book then the movie is easier to follow.  Having said that you will fall in  love with the lead characters anyway.<br />I do not recommend for children under 18.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|After reading the NYTimes review, I was intrigued. Happy to say(with tears rolling down my face), this story was great. Right time for me to read it too. I highly recommend.

B004X75RK4|4.0|Great movie (for a chick-flick).<br />Thought the plot was very original (for a chick-flick), and it was also quite funny. My wife and I enjoyed watching it together.<br />Great movie for couples-- its chick-flick so the girls will love it, and its actually kind of funny so the guys won't hang themselves during it.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I really liked the movie.  For once us girls received some eye candy!  Not much though but still it was nice to see.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie is awesome I was renting it from my local liberary and figured it was time to get my own DVD. I have watch 2'xs since I bought it. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. I must have seen in over a 100 x's.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Takes to long for energy to refill I would never spend real cash on a game like this gotta upgrade
B0085TKAW6|4.0|For a strong follower of Ken Follett this was familiar ground.  I enjoyed the continuation of the story around class in England and the mining community and the Socialism v commercial enterprise conflict.
B006O6F4O6|4.0|This was pretty neat. This was a gift for my grandson and he was having a lot of fun with it but the parts are easily lost and once they are gone the fun is sort of over. They should make replacement parts for these so if things get lost the toy can still be enjoyed.

B004V71CYQ|5.0|Even though today's graphics are much superior than they were back when this came out, I thought the movie brought the motives to evolve  computer graphic animation.

B003ZP6IPI|3.0|Brian Warner aka Marilyn Manson tells us about his life as a child, his parents, his relatives and friends.  His story is sad and disturbing. Marilyn then goes on to tell us the journey of his music career which like the beginning of his life is sad and tragic.<br /><br />The book includes 16 color pictures of Marilyn as well as black & white photos sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with very graphically detailed drawings identifying body organs.<br /><br />Marilyn has included the following lists and indicates at the end of each list which rules on the list he has broken. The list are: Drugs - 27 rules where you are addicted if they apply to you; Homosexuality - 39 rules that apply to you if you are gay; Cheating - 17 rules to identify if you are a cheater.<br /><br />Before becoming a rock star, Marilyn tried to get a writing career off the ground.  In his book she shares a short story, several poems, letters he send to magazines editors and letters he received from magazine editors.<br /><br />The book also contains interviews Marilyn did with Empyrean Magazine in 1995.<br /><br />At the end of the book Marilyn includes affidavits that were filed against him. He also encloses his tour diary.<br /><br />Marilyn discusses his significant relationship. At the end of the book, Marilyn declares he is enlightened, it's the only bright spot in the book.

B009YQJ322|5.0|Carl Urban is Judge Dredd!  He captures the look and the tone of the character to the letter. Dredd is actually Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry in the future. Judge Anderson added a human quality to the character to an otherwise down beat Dredd.  The plot was very simple.  Dredd and Anderson are locked up in a huge complex run by Mama.  A drug dealer and determined to take over the city.  It's the straight forward plot that drives the movie forward.  There are no Stallone like moments in this film. Dredd has his helmet on the entire movie!<br /><br />As far as the action was concerned, it was excellent for this character.  I hope there is a sequel.  I'd like more robots and mutants like the comic featured. Of all the comic adaptations, this one got it right!
1905236042|5.0|The genius of these cards for yoga poses is the ability of any participant in the family to choose a card, and get everybody to focus on it. I sent this to my daughter's family, in which there are three young children. The seven-year old boy can be a leader, and this gives him an outlet. Hopefully, get the parents involved in all doing a few poses together. I have not seen the cards, so cannot comment on the clarity of the illustrations. Not so much a program for a serious yoga student, I do not believe, but rather for healthful indoor or outdoor recreation for the family.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Loved it

B003Y5H5FG|3.0|For those who remember it, Tom Holland's 1985 vampire cult classic \\"Fright Night\\" is truly something special. Like most beloved cinematic nuggets, a remake was only a matter of time. Enter Craig Gillespie's \\"Fright Night,\\" a modern update of a story that encapsulated an era of horror movies, recalling a time when movie monsters were as much fun as they were frightening.  Boasting a solid cast with the likes of Anton Yelchin, David Tennant, Toni Collette, Christopher \\"McLovin\\" Mintz-Plasse and Colin Farrell, this remake starts off with the best of intentions, even if its execution leaves a little something to be desired.<br /><br />Built on the basic framework of Holland's original story, the details of this \\"Fright Night\\" are pretty familiar. Likeable yet slightly nerdy Charley Brewster (Yelchin) lives in the vanilla landscape of the suburbs (this time in the Las Vegas desert) with his single mother (Collette). Trouble comes to town when his neighbor, the charming Jerry Dandridge (Farrell), turns out to be a blood-thirsty vampire. In an effort to keep his mother -- as well as his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Imogen Poots) and his jaded former best bud \\"Evil\\" Ed (McLovin) -- out of danger, he teams up with washed-up vampire hunter/entertainer Peter Vincent (Tennant) and sets his sights on breaking into Jerry's bachelor pad and crashing his late-night party.<br /><br />Similar to 2011's \\"The Thing\\" prequel/remake, this incarnation of \\"Fright Night\\" seems to have most of the ingredients for a good time in place, but unfortunately suffers from a crippling feeling that this has been done already, only much better (admittedly a problem with most remakes). Even though this particular remake distances itself a bit from the original in certain aspects, it still hits the same basic beats as the original, which sucks a lot of the would-be intensity out of the room. Also, like the aforementioned \\"Thing,\\" this re-do boasts an awful lot of bad CGI blood and guts that may very well have looked fine in 3D, but which doesn't serve the film very well. On the upside, all the players on hand are game and the film moves at a relatively easy pace that builds its characters as it gives way to the obligatory chase scenes. There's also a cameo midway through the film that fans of the original film will relish. All the right components are in place for this film to be one of the least offensive (and, in turn, better) remakes in recent memory (and really, it is) but it doesn't quite fire on all cylinders, making for a film that works on the surface, but ultimately isn't a patch on its source material.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Fright Night\\" is a wholly unnecessary yet admittedly entertaining remake. When one thinks of modern remakes, there are worse efforts that come to mind. Forgiven its flaws, this re-telling of a true cult classic gets the job done with minimal damage. Those who consider the original to be sacred would be best advised to steer clear, but those seeking a fun vampire romp minus the glitter could do much worse. If nothing else, it will inspire anyone who watches it to dust off a copy of the 1985 original and give it a spin (some for the hundredth time, many for the first), and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.e looked fine in 3D, but which doesn't serve the film very well.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had already seen the movie and enjoyed it a lot, and assumed the book would have so much more detail.  There is quite a bit of philosophy, particularly in the beginning, and the book addressed Pi's spiritual quest in a way that seemed logical.  At the same time you have a story that is quite imaginative leaving you to ponder that hard choices that Pi had to make on his physical journey while lost at sea.  I hope to see another book from Mr. Martel soon!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is also one of my wife's favorite.  She's been playing cards all her life.  When she was working they even had tournaments at lunch time.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I choose this rating because i liked ever part of this book. I like the main character rick because hes, brave, smart, and a good leader. I would recommend this book to zombie lovers and action lovers.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I do like some of the music of Beyonce and this is on my list.  On Top is a great song for exercising
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A good challenge.  Moves along to next level smoothly with relaxing music.  A good find that is addicting and keeps you coming back for more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great for the whole family.  Really gets your mind working. Nicolette (14) she so far has gotten the highest score.

0062082353|5.0|my son loved it always wanted to a MARINE!  Really gives you a feeling for what they go thru and do!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book helped changed my thought processes! It said thiings I've been taught my whole life & gave me the understanding I need as an adult. I am recommending this book to everyone!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My wife and I are both enjoying this game. We spend a lot of time playing it. It is sort of addictive
B004DM0UII|4.0|I was told about this app by my daughter who found her favorite Christian radio station right away. While mine wasnt available, I could listen to hers and while my favorite classical station was not available either, a short seach by Classical genre gave me several good choices as well as one with NO commercials (at least not so far). This is really a good app for my Kindle as I really enjoy listening to clasical music while reading and even while playing games.
0525953728|5.0|Glad we got these boys on our side!  GO MAN GO!  Looking forward to seeing the movie.  Keep up the good work Seals!
B001UW58YK|5.0|Love it, enough said. Had already bought this one so of course I picked it again by mistake so it will definitely be around for a long time, as he will!!  First heard him on an Italian show in 2007 before he made his debut in USA.  Knew he'd be a hit!!
B00AHCF9E8|4.0|Summary: This is the only album of the 3 that I feel deserves to be sold at regular price. Overall, the quality of the album average-good according to Green Day standards. Instrumentation was top notch, but lyrics seem to be lacking/confusing/wtf at times. While this is to be somewhat expected out of Green Day, this album, as well as the other 2 seem to be dragged down by lyrics, and the instrumentation tries to come in and save the day.<br /><br />Favorites: Missing You, X-Kid, Dirty Rotten Bastards<br />Flops: Brutal Love, Amanda,<br /><br />Brutal Love: Seems like a b-side song that they tried to make into something it is not. I enjoy the arrangement, but the lyrics were just lacking<br /><br />Missing You: This upbeat song would have been great to start the album off with a bang, even though it covers a sappy subject. The lyrics are simple, but catchy and make since. Great bass line in the middle and nice drum fill in the bridge to bring back the song into the chorus.<br /><br />8th Avenue Serenade: Very catchy, very good instrumentation, but one of those songs that after hearing, you are thinking wtf is he talking about and what point was the song trying to get to.<br /><br />Drama Queen: Lyrics that make enough since that you can infer what the point is. Also includes a double entendre &#34;old enough to bleed now&#34;. Very simple instrumentation, but it is so catchy, and really is a nice change of pace.<br /><br />X-Kid: Lyrics make since and portray a powerful message. This is a song that seems carefully crafted and is one of my favorite of the trilogy. Instruments come in strong we needed.<br /><br />Sex, Drugs, & Violence: Not a hit song, but a good filler song and definitely sounds like a Green Day song. Lyrics are average, but extremely catchy. Bass player gets a few vocal moments of fame.<br /><br />A Little Boy Named Train: Has the feeling of old school Green Day that everybody loves. Instrumentation is top notch. It seems that the instrumentation goes all out to try and overcome all the random lyrics that don't make a whole lot of sense together. In parts, the lyrics are catchy and are written well, but the parts don't fit together.<br /><br />Amanda: B-side song that they tried to through a bunch of nice instrumentation on top of in order to make it album worry. However, it still only manages to be 2 minutes and about 30 seconds. I just did not quite get would the lyrics were supposed to mean once again.<br /><br />Walk Away: This song jumps between filler and hit song. Lyrics are a little too simple at times, but also pretty smart and catchy at other times. I used to think it was just a filler song, but it really has been growing on me. &#34;Well the bigger that you call All the lying I can’t afford, Walk away&#34; Really like how he puts the line; when people call you out on the bluff of the bs you've been trying to hide.<br /><br />Dirty Rotten Bastards: Very open, balls to the wall, all hands on deck song. Signature Green Day multiple song ideas within one song. Less structure than most songs, so everybody goes crazy. I'm sure they will love playing this song live adding their own random parts each night. Lyrics are a little random, but with an open song like this, that's just fine. One of the best on the record<br /><br />99 Revolutions: Simple understandable lyrics, good instrumentation, deals with 99%ers. Personally, I thought the song was structured well, but I just was not really interested in the topic, so the song was not real interesting to me.<br /><br />The Forgotten: Despite the twilight label, this is a great song. It is clear this one was well thought out and took a lot of studio time. Musically, this song is very sound. Has a similar sound to Time of your life(good riddance). However, this song is engineered, whereas the song that has had a cult following is naturally constructed, emotionally heartfelt simply beautiful. The Forgotten will be forgotten rather quickly while Time of your lifelives on for ages.
B000VZBCWE|3.0|Upon opening this DVD's live performance of Queen, I was somewhat disappointed in the production. The clarity was average to me considering this 2-DVD set is digitally restored with DTS surround sound. I guess I would reconsider this purchase if I had the opportunity. Not that impressed considering some of the performance videos I've seen on UTube of other rock superstars.
B000002KDG|5.0|This is awesome and I would totallly recommend it to anyone!  This album has great classic Neil Young early songs
1423113462|5.0|Gave as a gift to my daughter who is an avid reader.  She was very happy.  She has just started this series.

B004HO6I4M|5.0|Kids love this movie! Had such a fun story and love the music! Such a fun show to have in stock!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I sure did learn much history while reading this book.  Ken Follett is an amazing author, and his research for the books he writes is unsurpassed!
B00447G29S|5.0|It came sealed as if I would buy it at the store, the disc was new, no scratches. Same disk 2D & 3D versions so it played perfect on my 3D Blue Ray DVD player.
B0031RS9MU|5.0|Party and Ram clearly state the lack of importance to execution over strategy.<br /><br />so much has been written about strategy. My quick review of customers reviewing books on strategy itself outweighs this excellent one on execution. I fully agree with the authors.<br /><br />This book clearly shows execution is no more a tactic as its largely perceived but a strategic differentiator. My views on execution are clearly reinforced in the book and I strongly recommend students and all practitioners to must read this.<br /><br />Happy reading and extraordinary execution to realise your dreams !!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is a great series!  Not quite as good as the first season but still a must see.  I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of intrigue.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|My Daughter is such a 'Trekkie' and she adores Star Trek and she wore it around for a few days. Its good material, and seems to be able to withstand a lot of pressure.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I found this app on the market and was easily impressed. I ended up getting it and tried it, I was again, impressed. Jet pack has a wide range of gadgets and tools to choose from, and is very addicting!! The only downside is, one or two of the gadgets aren't all they're cracked up to be. However, of all the apps I have, I must say that jet pack is my favorite!!! If you have to pick one game to get, jet pack is your best bet!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|i was not sure about this book but it sucked me in & i could not put it down. it is both hopeful & heartbreaking & several days after finishing it, i'm still thinking about it.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Love this CD!  My parents did too; so we left ours with them and now need to order another one!
B009VB97EY|3.0|The plot was weak, the men were sexy, feels like I've seen the movie before different title, except it was women.
B004XKVPG6|5.0|The movie came in perfect condition and was great to watch. Made for a great movie night. I recommend for others to see it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Soa is just a awesome show...once you start watching it you can't stop!!! I will definitely buy the rest of the seasons
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Movie never lived up to the play.  Russell Crowe was chosen for his name, not his voice.  So disappointed because it<br />is our very favorite play.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This was good movie, I was glad I could rewind and go back and forth to see the effects of
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|it's so nice to have my own diary. I can right something I'm thankful for each day! thanks for my awesome diary!
B0086UXYZO|4.0|Good sophomore album, I really enjoy a majority of the songs! Their songs seem straight from another time period with a modern twist. The CD came right on time
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie in the series.  Very easy to rent through Amazon app on my smart blu-ray player!  Cheaper rental than DirecTV options.
B00002Z88D|5.0|When I got this album I honestly wasn't sure how it would sound and how I would react. Honestly I enjoy all of Metallica's work from beginning to end and knowing that they tried to have a concert backed up by an orchestra was taking it beyond their usual performance. Normally I am not with a symphony's music but this CD was an exception. I loved it, the idea having rock music mixed with an orchestra actually worked and the funny thing is I don't think any other rock band out there would sound good like they did. I rated this a 5 because I believe it was a challenge for Metallica to do this knowing there would be a lot of skeptical opinions. It was creative and it was great to listen to. Its basically their greatest hits up to 1999 with an orchestra behind them I recommend it to any Metallica fan out there
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it's a totally great book it's the best book ever I've never read a book like it
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was a great continuation of The Girl wth the Dragon Tattoo. I was very surprised by the twists and turns that Steig Larsson had you following!
B0031RS7A4|5.0|A writing style sharp, funny, cristal clear virtuosity in every page, that's the genius in Wodehouse. Besides the Code of the Woosters have an unforgettable villain, Roderick Spode, which have to be read to be believed..
B009K0P10K|4.0|Normally I wouldn't touch a mainstream TV show with a 10 foot pole. I certainly wouldn't touch a mainstream TV show about snooty people who live in New England. I heard it was good, and one night because we where caught up with The Walking Dead...we started watching it....Not Bad..<br />The Characters are interesting, the plot doesn't get boring, and we actually enjoyed it.
B005K17RU0|2.0|POOR radar  satellite maps for tropical Caribbean.  i don't like the weather maps available for tropical weather.  I am not able to see good weather maps for Mexican Belizean Caribbean. areas.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is totally worth the download. One of the best games I have played on a tablet. If u like action this is the game for u
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you have been reading the series thAn you will love this one as well.  It will surely leave you wanting the next book right away, what is to come will be spectacular!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|THIS IS THE COOL GAME I THINK BECAUSE YOU GET TO BUY &amp; PICK YOUR JET PACKS.YOU GET TO PICK THE SPIN TOKENS.
0062127241|4.0|Pete Townshend's career with The Who has been legendary. However, I was not so familiar with other of his music, and that is one of the best takeaways from this book for me.<br /><br />It is a standard biography in its form--chronological order. The writing is very matter of fact, \\"just the facts ma'am.\\" We get a lot of detail about his family life, his musical life, and his private life. He seems, for the most part, to have avoided the excesses of many other rock stars.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the book tells well the story of his drug use (including alcohol), his sometimes wild sexual life (although, more often than not, he lived a pretty normal life along those lines), his family life (he seems as if he has been a pretty good father), and so on. While he is not overly open about his private life, we do get a pretty good sense of it.<br /><br />And I did enjoy learning more about his work. The many projects that he undertook with The Who and the details of his own musical work. His ambition to craft large scale works sometimes did not work out, but it is admirable that he dreamed big.<br /><br />We also get an insight into the characters of his Who mates--Roger Daltry, John Entwistle, and Keith Moon. He also tells stories about Eric Clapton and other stars in the world of rock and roll.<br /><br />All in all, a nice book. Not overly analytical, but an enjoyable read.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Great new show. Being a Sherlock Holmes fan I didn't think I would like an Americanized version but I found it engaging and well worth watching. Now I am hooked!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I like Eminem anyway, but this CD will not let you down.....the typical Eminem attitude with a small bit of &#34;feeling&#34; thrown in. I love the &#34;message&#34; of this album and the rawness of it. He seems to let his guard down a little in this one and seems a small bit &#34;stripped down&#34; as compared to his others. His greatness in the Rap world d this album NEVER falters and this album is NO EXCEPTION. If you're thinking about buying this CD, BUY IT! Don't hesitate for a moment, you will NOT be sorry! VERY REAL and STRAIGHT CD! You'll love it.......
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I like the game;  It is addictive... BUT!!!!!  I have an android operating system, so I did not get all the little extras the WebOS folks did, like the ZEN GARDEN, and some of the BONUS GAMES!!!  Paid the same price, though!!  I would NOT RECCOMMEND this to anyone who has the ANDROID OS system - you get 1/3 the game for the sme price as the WebOS folks pay.  Kinda a rip-off....
1451627297|4.0|A rollicking good yarn well-told by someone who clearly knows how to write.  Although the book is long, it reads quickly.  Unlike other similar novels I've read recently which require the author to do quite a bit of research in order to get the facts of the past right (Lincoln's Dreams comes to mind), this one does not hit the reader over the head with too many facts just to prove that the author did the research.  I have not read any other Stephen King novels (but did read several collections of his novellas a long time ago, which I enjoyed) so I cannot compare but I would recommend this one to anyone who is looking for a good adventure/love story.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|fun and challenging without being extremely difficult .Would recommend for good way to spend free time .Beats what's  on television
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love it these episode are so good that I will recommend to all my friends and family so bad I'll have to wait to see more until the next season
0920668372|5.0|This book is a great gift for a mother who has a son. I read it to my son and he loves it.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It varys from any movie version or the play, but still quite good.  I'd give three and a half stars.  There is a vast section of it devoted to the battle of Waterloo and I still cannot quite see why Victor Hugo stuck it in, at least not at the great, great length that he went to.  Nor why he went to the great length he did to discuss the character who was Fantine's lover and the father of Cossete.  He could have done the same thing in ten pages instead of fifty.  OK, OK, I get that he was a blowhard and a reprobate but Hugo beat it death.<br />This is one of the great classics of all times but it would not make it into the best seller lists in this day and age in this form.  It's simply too long and verbose.  With apologies to any World literature professors or Victor Hugo fans.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love Bones and this is a great season! I am glad that it was priced reasonably as well so it fit my budget.  Thanks
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the best book I read and that money that I used was worth it plus that meeting made this book funny
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Nobody does this type of programming like the British.  Production values are great and storylines and characters are interesting.  I recommend you buy it.
B003W5C0VM|3.0|If you're looking at this, you obviously like the Stones, so I won't go into their performance.  What I will mention is this film's rendering of those performances.  Unfortunately, like so many concert films of this era, both the audio and the visual presentations are pretty bad.  The blu ray isn't appreciably better than the DVD.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|While it wasn't my favorite of her novels I did enjoy getting to read some of her earlier works. A great fun read.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Yes I love musicals and I was really surprised by the performances that came out of this one. They were good. I grew up in the 80's so it brought back a lot of memories. Even my 16yr old son got into it. He likes music and he appreciated this. Lot's of singing along feel good scenes.
0439023513|5.0|District thirteen is alive and underground. They saved Katniss, Finnick,and many more from the Quell. A new rebellion will take place. And this time, Thirteen's got Katniss, their Mockingjay. She encourages the troops and shoots propos. Katniss fantasies murdering Snow. He killed Effie, Cinna, Portia, and all prep teams but Katniss's. She can't choose from Peeta or Gale. &#34;Snow says he has a message for us? Well, I have one for him. You see this?  FIRE IS CATCHNG! AND IF WE BURN, YOU BURN WITH US!&#34; - Katniss Everdeen
B005LAII12|3.0|This is a pretty good Budweiser commercial.  I doubt it'll play during the superbowl due to its length so you'll have to rent or buy it to see it.  I hope we see more feature-length commercials in the future.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|All three Toy Story movies get five stars in my book, but TS2 is my favorite of the bunch.  Gotta love Rex!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|They pull u into these movies with the hopes of getting more but because the ratings didn't sour they leave u hanging. Can't they make it to go straight to DVD  when they tease u like this? It was well written and was really getting good with #6 added and the son of the man who knows stuff? My son and I watched it together. Entertaining!
0439023491|5.0|The Quarter Quell. The years that make the arena a living nightmare. A little something extra is added to the Quells to make them both more entertaining for the Capitol, and harder to the tributes. The 25 Quell was picking the kids that had to go. The 50th was sending twice as many tributes. Surprisingly, against all odds, this is the year that Haymitch Abernathy won. And now, 75 is that the tributes will be reaped from the existing pool of victors. Two male. One female...Katniss is going back to the arena, and she might not come back alive. Tick, tock.
B0086700CM|3.0|My Kids have fun with this game however, they unknowingly buy coins. I was shocked when a received a bill for $10. Nice game but USE CAUTION!!!
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|Wonderful series if you enjoy British historical fiction.  I like it very much.  Amazon charges for Downton Abbey episodes that can be viewed without cost.  Google Downton Abbey.  Enjoy.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was funny and fresh in a lot of ways. Fat Amy was funny and it was nice to see a college movie like this were they're not just hooking up just to flash tits and we did get a gratuities ab shot of the hot DJ.
B00877R85I|5.0|Overall, my favorite book series has been the Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins takes you to Panem, a country that emerged out of war. There are 12 districts  no, as during the Dark Ages, 13 was destroyed for rebelling against the evil Capitol. The Capitol wants to make the districts sorry that they ever rebelled, so they put up the Hunger Games. Districts 1-12  must send in one male and female tribute to fight to death on live TV. And only one tribute can get out alive for the Capitol's amusement. Join Katniss Everdeen, who has been determined to feed her mother and sister, Prim. Who she is fiercely protective of. And it's Prim's first year in the Reaping. District twelve hasn't had a winner since the 50 Hunger Games. The 74th Hunger Games tribute is...Primrose Everdeen. The Hunger Games have begun...
B001684L0A|5.0|As anticipated. Not much else to add, was on time and the product was what I had in fact ordered.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Intense thriller, a bit over the top violent and somewhat constrained. Certainly a &#34;GUY&#34; flick. Good rental over my Logitech review.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was so moving. I really enjoyed the story. The more I read,the more I can relate to some of the event Charlie goes through. Amazing book.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great stuff. Put me in the mind of Starship Troopers, and that alone would have been worth the read, but Scalzi does an excellent job of really looking at the ramifications of his premise.<br /><br />Some nice use of suspense in various scenes, and good, clear prose throughout. The only thing I noticed is a fair bit of repetition (of words, not concepts) which is simply something I prefer not to see. (But that's really owing to the inner editor who is always chattering at me.)<br /><br />Absolutely recommend for sci-fi and war buffs.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I think it relates to how a lot of teenager feel at a very confusing juncture in their lives, not an adult yet, but not a kid anymore either.
B006DLP6JA|5.0|Worked well on new build,but wasn`t as fast ,or quick to respond,as expected.<br />Guess I`ll have to upgrade OS & add 8 more gigs of memory.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I don't think I have the correct type of computer for this game.  I didn't understand the concept, let alone know how to work it.
B007R41E8O|5.0|enjoyed the game no problem downloading or playing it<br />used a lot of hints because there was a lot of places to go in the game<br />n
0793563836|5.0|Their books are spot on and easy to follow. If you're looking for a book to help teach you a musical instrument you have to go far and away to find something &#34;better&#34;.
0307592731|1.0|I admire that she had the strength and resolve to take her journey.  However, I am angry that she obviously glosses over having an abortion but agonizes how her dry, calloused hips will appear to a stranger while they prepare to have casual sex.  Whatever your stance on abortion, I still find it harsh that she was so dismissive about it.  Becoming a mother is an even better journey and requires even more strength, love, maturity than she wrote about or conveyed from her hike. I felt a strong dislike how proud she seems to be that a good looking BMW lawyer hit on her at the end of her journey.  Although she didn't act on his offer it still punctuates she was immature and had a long way to go.
B008EOVHXI|3.0|Hmmm... Not going to lie I was not totally satisfied with this purchase. Some of the songs she plays on here are at such incredibly fast tempos that it's not even enjoyable. La Campanella is completely RUINED and so is the Tabluex Etude..... Disappointed Valentina... I do like your playing but some of the songs on here...
B00884GR0W|5.0|It's good but Idk how to get armor in the game.is there even armor in the game and need s a update.I wound like to know.but other than that it's a great game and you should buy it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Every book in the series is great! Love all the characters!  One problem though, I have to wait till fall for the next book :(
B005LAII12|5.0|purchased as a christmas gift for my husband.  we both loved it and even my 81 year old mother loved it
B007TNS6JI|3.0|great game. not as good as dungeon hunter 2 though. I cant wait for a dungeon hunter 4. dungeon hunter 2 isnstillnthe best
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Read this cause my best friend was running away to get married. Great book for those of us who want and believe in real love.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My son brought home the first book for Christmas break to read for extra points. I told him, that book is huge, you'll have to read 30 pages a day to finish in time. After he read the first 30 pages to me I was hooked. Great characters, good humor. Great writer!

B006T3RM08|1.0|Perhaps I got a faulty one, but whenever I \\"clique\\" my Magic Trackpad into its slot, the trackpad doesn't work anymore. It seems that the trackpad gets stuck under the front lip and acts as if it is always pressed. So I have to lay the trackpad on the thing such that it's halfway off the back. I would not recommend this product if this is standard; if I have a faulty one, okay, but it's hardly worth sending a $20 piece of plastic back in (in terms of shipping costs to me). I watched 7 videos online so I'm fairly sure I'm using it correctly ...
1592402690|5.0|If only you could have been a fly on a wall during the Beatles recording sessions...  Well, there was a fly, and his name was Geoff Emerick.<br /><br />I make music and am also a big Beatles fan, I found this book to be absolutely fascinating.  I think this book could be thoroughly enjoyed by any Beatles fan.  Maybe a little technical and dry for those who have no appreciation for the recording process, but full of information about the Beatles everyday life inside the studio, from their beginning to end.  Highly recommended!
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Purchased for Grandson for Christmas, 2012. It has been viewed many times since then. He says the movie is, &#34;Awesome&#34;.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is amazing! It tells me when the kindle will shut down and how much time I have for spasific tasks and activities. I love it. plus not once didn't malfunction or freeze on me like most free apps, so that was a good surprise. anyway, you should check it out.
B004LROUW2|4.0|I had read &#34;Norwegian Wood&#34; from Murakami and had fallen in love with the writer. So, instead of choosing a title closer in date to it, I decided to read his last novel. I was a bit disappointed to see how commercial it is; it basically has all the elements to make it a best seller: sex (lots of it), romance, controvertial topics (religion), suspense and more. I did, however, enjoyed reading it a lot, as Murakami knows how to keep you hooked to the story, to the very last page. There are very little things you can predict, so it never becomes a simple, boring, been-there-done-that kind of novel. Characters are really well defined. I didn't enjoy passive male models in &#34;Norwegian Wood&#34; but this seems to be a trend or maybe a cultural issue for Murakami. I would recommend it to both male and female readers who like fiction in a real world.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  Helen Hunt is amazing and it has a play like feel to the movie, in keeping with its roots.
B006PJJF2O|4.0|I am a 29 year old folk rock/classic rock enthusiast building a vinyl collection after being given a record player for Christmas.  \\"A Gift from a Flower to a Garden\\" is my favorite Donovan album and was happy to be able to find such a rarity in vinyl format.  The two records are in perfect condition and play wonderfully.  The box is in very good condition as well.  My one disappointment is that the album artwork this album is famous for seems to be missing from the box.  There were pictures of it advertised by the seller before I bought it, so I wish I could have gotten everything I was led to expect and paid for.  However, the music is the most important detail to me and it plays perfectly just as advertised.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|This movie was entertaining but predictable.  You just know the &#34;star&#34; athlete that acts like a jerk will get his come- upance  just as you know the jerk back in the office will be proved wrong and fired.  Also that the quiet, unassuming young man will be the real &#34;star&#34; .  But, it is entertaining to watch.
030758836X|4.0|it's a rare book that really locks me in and makes me want to read every spare minute i get. that was gone girl... even without the mystery, i loved the style of writing, i loved the character analysis, feeling the marriage conflict. i have to say though that i was disappointed at the last 1/3 of the book, i think it went \\"loosey-goosey\\" and lost its credibility.<br />but then again, that's apparently the tale that the author wanted to tell. i'll definitely check out her other books.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I read a lot of different kinds of books, across many genres.<br /><br />The Jack Reacher series is what I call a Popcorn Novel, similar to a Popcorn Flick.  Those kinds of movies don't need to be perfect, have the greatest acting, completely believable characters or situations.  They just have to entertain you and keep you engrossed in the story.  The Reacher books are like this.<br /><br />Hitchcock created suspense by putting ordinary people into extraordinary circumstances; Child puts an unbelievable character into unbelievable circumstances and creates a fun ride.<br /><br />Die Trying was a great read, lots of fun and I loved Holly's character of a strong woman who could take care of herself.  I liked the first book having first person to get you deep in Reacher's head, and this one in third to expand his world and see the viewpoints of other characters too.<br /><br />Jack Bauer is totally a Jack Reacher clone - and since I loved 24 and its completely unbelievable characters and situations, I love this series too.<br /><br />So sit back, grab the popcorn and enjoy a heck of a fun action ride.
B000X9NI5W|5.0|Very atmospheric. Nothing out there quite like it. I would recommend this album to anybody who is losing faith in electronica and where it's been heading
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't really like reading but this book is AMAZING I would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes alternative future books or quick suspense filled books. : )
B009IF82SK|5.0|Laughed My Arse Off.  They went where very few men have gone before. And they hit it from two ends. Girls, and comics, plus the geek squad
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Friend showed me this game on his Samsung galaxy. It looked fun, I paid 99 cents,and it was well worth it. Really enjoy playing it.
B003EY62II|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this Scooby Doo movie.  He says it's cool and funny and sort of scary.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very intense book. However, I hoped for a much different ending. Oh well at least there's still 2 more books.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|it gliches all the time I had to restart 5 times I think I might delete the game. If the gliches were gone I would play it
B000PKX2KA|2.0|I bought that for my sons pickup, his pickup is 32 yr's old so it could not be used in it. and i had to return it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it wont let  me buy coins but other than that this game is amazing i love it i cant put it down
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|total waste of money it comes in the kindle fire hd free. If i knew I would never have purchased it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omb I love this game I play it all the time. love how awesome it on any electronic. yeah yeah yeah
B005ZUR724|5.0|It's is the best game in the world I play it all the time I waste my weekend playing it
B005E8KQPM|5.0|I'm not sure what it is about this album, but there's something about it that makes me want to claim it's the best album ever made. I know that's an absolutely absurd statement -- but I'm sticking by it. It's a total journey filled with ups and downs.<br /><br />Having never been an Opeth fan (not too big on death metal), this was the first album I had really gave good listen to. I'll admit I became interested when I heard Steven Wilson wanted to rate it in his top albums of the year, but wouldn't because he had a hand in making it. Well, album of the year is right -- dare I say it even tops the excellent Grace for Drowning?<br /><br />I know everyone says it's a &#34;love it or hate it&#34;, but I challenge the hate it people to play this in the background while doing work, or on a long drive in the night. It will grow on you. I think you have to come in to it with no expectations.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this game is the awesomest game ever !!!!! so I hope u like the game !!!! have fun with the game !!!!
B009M588K8|5.0|My son-in-law is in the Navy and wanted this book for Christmas.  I ordered the book and received it by mail about 3-days.  I was worried that it may not be here before Christmas but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived so quickly.  The book was brand new, as was noted, shrink wrapped and in excellent condition.  As always, I was extremely please with my purchase through Amazon and will continue to use Amazon sellers for my future transaction.  By the way, my son-in-law could not put the book down and read it in two days.  Thanks for meeting all of my expectations.  Patti at the Beach
B008GWOVB8|5.0|I watch this once a week. It's  great for stress. I sing and dance to the entire movie and then I'm forget about what upset me in the first place.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I'm not sure what I thought when this one was first released. Any fan of Batman knows there isn't \\"one Batman.\\" I also remember that during Frank Miller's \\"Dark Knight\\" comics, in which he essentially reinvented and revitalized Bob Kane's character, there was talk floating of Clint Eastwood playing the character, which would have been AMAZING. The \\"Dark Knight\\" Batman was older, and in many ways, just as messed up as The Joker. Eastwood could have nailed it, but it never hapened.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" was released under the shadw of the untimely and sad passing of Heath Ledger. Ledger didn't do the campy, jovial buffoon of the late-sixties DC comics era, and he didn't do the over-the-top, scenery-chewing nutcase that Jack Nicholson portrayed in the Tim Burton film with Michael Keaton. Ledger's portrayal of the the character is based on a man who is GONE, and ain't comin' BACK.<br /><br />Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nothing more than a placeholder for Batman. Michael Keaton did well with the brooding, angry, insular world of the millionaire crimefighter, but Bale's Wayne lacks any true joy, charisma, joie de vivre...he's just marking time before the next time he puts on the suit.<br /><br />It's really Ledger's film. He's the reason to watch, he drives the plot, he has the best lines, he is the protagonist. He plays the character as if he's constantly on meds, flipping out only one time in the film (and when he does it's pretty chilling). If Cesar Romero played the role as Bozo the Clown, Ledger played it as John Wayne Gacy.<br /><br />It really is a decent Batman offering. I thought the first Bale film was weak, and I haven't seen the third. If you are in need of a Batman fix and you like your \\"Caped Crusader\\" dark, intense, and p*ssed off, this is the Batman film for you.
1419705849|4.0|My son got this as a present.  He enjoyed reading it and he is usually not much of a  reader.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I don't usually buy an entire album anymore as I only like one or two songs on them so I will just buy an mp3 of the songs I like and leave the rest. however after listening to this album on YouTube for awhile I decided to get the CD. If you like Enigma, you will like this.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The Smith's PP1 is small, light, inexpensive, and it works.  While I agree it may not be the best sharpener and with the fixed angle its not for all knives but everything has its place in the world.<br /><br />Using this sharpener is easy.  A few pulls through the carbine slot to set the blade and a few pulls through the ceramic to refine the edge.  Serrated edges can be sharpened with the fold out diamond rod.  My quick tips are to be sure you keep constant pressure, angle, and speed when sharpening.  Additionally, listen for the sound and feel the resistance change as they are indicators you're done with whichever slot you're using.<br /><br />I used this sharpener on some cheap pocket and hunting knives ($20 or less) and it normally takes me about 6 pulls to set a new blade and maybe 3-4 to reset an edge.  That's not a set rule but just to give an idea.<br /><br />For the price, size, weight, and function I think this is an excellent sharpener for camping,hunting, bug out/survival bag, etc.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I thought this product was amazing. It even came with the digital copies! I would recommend this for all Movie buffs
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I bought this movie because I am a Russell Crowe fan and a Robin Hood fan.  Got it at a really great price, too.  I was very happy to find that my husband really enjoyed it too, since it was a gift for him.  It was a bit of a different take on the regular Robin Hood retelling that you usually hear, which made it more interesting.  Also the movie was very well cast and acted.  Just can't go wrong with this one!  Great movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I loved it and got caught up in the characters lives. I highly recommend this book. Its so much more than just a romance.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|rock and roll i like. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a .
B004EPYZUS|3.0|I had heard great things about this movie, and that it blew away all the previous Mission Impossible movies.  Unfortunately, I think that was just a lot of hype that was spread around to attempt to revive Tom Cruises' career.  The movie was okay, but definitely not the best of the series.
B003K1EYM6|2.0|not sure how to use.A s most apple products not user friendly. it will take me some time to learn how to use.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|no duds on this album. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . !
B004LWZWGA|5.0|A really fantastic end to the Dark Knight series.  The top-notch cast did a superb job!  We highly enjoyed this movie, which included a great twist that we never even saw coming!  BUY IT!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is the best!!! The makeup and drama could not be better! A difinante must see in high def!!
B006YC74E8|5.0|works good so far. it is a must for anyone with the kindle fire hd, which for some reason comes without any camera function ability and its free.
B000FC12SM|5.0|it is incredible read. wonderful explanations on the common mis communication between men and women. I laughed, cried and smiled with renewed understanding
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. the hidden objects were clear to see,graphics were good,and the story made sense. it is one I would recommend.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I love the Weather Channel app on my android phone.  However, I could not get it to work on my Android tablet that I got for christmas.  Got it downloaded, but it wouldn't open.  No problem with the product.. thought it would work in any format.  Had to un-install it. :(
B007IXWL2C|4.0|it was a good read, very hot and heavy. And a good book if your into that kind of thing
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so wonderful. it woo good for children I love it. my whole family loves the game it I so awesome
B009JBZH54|5.0|I purchased this box set since the price is unbeatable.  All 3 movies are great especially the Dark Knight Rises which was an unforgettable, why buy this movie alone while for $10.00 more you can buy the whole trilogy.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|it was a good read, very hot and heavy. And a good book if your into that kind of thing
B008M0NDOK|2.0|I like the controller bit there isn't enough to play with it and my favorite game isn't supported by this controller.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent.  this is a very good. I loved season one and am looking forward to season 3<br />would highly recommend
0786955570|5.0|Wish I had more cash to support my local game shop.  But times are tough.  It's better to play than not to play.  I've played a few times over the last year.  Once you learn the mechanics of the game it's great.  I went to youtube and watched a guy play a few different types of gameplay for this game.  I'm a total newb.  So watching the youtube videos on how to play was great.  It's more of a traditional board game once you played a few games.  It's a great way to break up a Friday or Saturday night when going out might be out of your budget.  Sure it's nerdy, but if you have an imagination and some sort of people skills you can have a great time.  Have a few beers(if your of age ;-)  and have a blast.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is easily one of the best Rush albums ever! They really took their genius of their songwriting and stepped it up higher than ever before! 1000% recommended to anybody who actually believes in using real instruments to make music! Cheers!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Having my phone for over a year, with trouble getting weather information updates, the Weather Channel assisted me immensely and it is free. Just one click, put in area code and you are off and running.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game! Love the other game, Flow Free: Bridges, too! Maybe even better than this one! Lots of fun for the puzzle lover!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Even for a fiction novel it has some amazing perspective. It was a quick read, great if you don't have that much time to yourself because each chapter stands by itself.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This is a very interesting album. I bought it for my husband because he really likes the song &#34;Sail.&#34; He does not like the rest of the album, but i love it! i listen to it when i work out, run and driving! Great Album.
B002RXHW6S|2.0|My 2 yr loves this but unfortunately is started having holes in the seam after 2 weeks.  She is not rough with it.  After 4 weeks, it got more holes in a different seam.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I have used AccuWeatehr for a long time on both my desk top computer and my laptop computer.  This is an excellent suppliment for my two  KIndle Fires.  It makes it very easy and the best visual I have yet seen
B00062PN6I|1.0|Bought it for my son's iPad and the jack is not standard ... its very big and does not fit into a regular headphone plug in your computer. Haven't been able to find anything it fits into. Very frustrating.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final installment is a must read. The writing is such that one can practically feel the heat of the flames, smell the roses and taste the ashes. The epilogue pulls everything together with a few simple words.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Must read! This book is absolutely amazing, crazy, and awesome! I didn't like this book very much at first as I don't typically enjoy books told in different perspectives chapter by chapter, but I kept reading. And then I was hooked! I would find reasons to leave the room just to see what Nick and Amazing Amy were up to now.....definitely worth it. I can't wait to read another book by Gillian Flynn.
B00000I9P0|5.0|Great music - just as I remember from the movie.  I've shared with others and even got another CD to share with friends.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|It was honestly better than expected.  Rebel Wilson by far is my favorite character in it.  The cast seems to mesh together well and the mash ups are actually pretty good!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Really liked this book. The book always starts off a little slow then it just grabs your attention and you can't put it down.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|All three movies are great. The price was great also. To get all three for basically the price of one, wow. The acting is just superb and the action is better than any other movies.
0765325950|5.0|Since Amazon keeps track of what I like, I received notice of the impending release of this FINAL volume right before Christmas.  My brother and I share a love for this series and I was able to pre-order and have it shipped directly to him (and myself). (I printed out a picture of the book and put it in his stocking for Christmas) Both arrived in separate states right on time and in perfect order. I am SO happy to have it - just started reading it - but am sad that it is the &#34;end&#34; of the series....oh, well - since I own the complete series in hard cover I'll just have to start over!
B00942V1J4|5.0|Love this whole series of movies. Will definitely buy the next one when it becomes available. Can't wait to see The Host.
1567312373|3.0|I read this book long ago.  It's even crazier than I remember it!  Very tongue-in-cheek, but makes fun with a sense of equality
B00A5052YE|5.0|I enjoy Alicia's voice, but I have never been an ardent fan until now (where have I been?).  De Novo Adagio/Brand New Me are on constant repeat.  My 2nd favorite is Fire We Make, Alicia's duet with Maxwell.  Both of these songs are worth the price of this work.<br /><br />The other songs are becoming favorites:  One Thing, When It's All Over, 101, and Listen to Your Heart.<br /><br />Girl on Fire has made me a Nicki Minaj fan (I did not know who she was other than the loud judge from AI).  Maybe its where I am in my life right now, but I really appreciated these lines:  &#34;Make the fire disappear when they stare God<br />Take away my fear when they interfere God.&#34;
B005LAJ1HW|4.0|The only problem I had with this product is that the Digital Copy did not download properly onto my computer and has become more of a hassle than a luxury.  Otherwise, the Blu-ray copy is great!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Thoughtless, non creative, boring and very forgettable. Don't waste your time. I knew this movie would never live up to the classic TR but I expect some kind of creativity be it through action, humor, special effects, gratuitous sex scenes....give me something. I watched the entire movie hoping that there would be 1 scene to justify the $4 rental.<br />There was not one decent scene, very disappointing.
1586212222|5.0|David Sedaris is great!  This was purchased for a long driving trip and made time pass quickly.  Would definitely recommend this!
1594488886|5.0|\\"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,<br />Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\\"<br /><br />These words appear twice in A Thousand Splendid Suns; it is a testament to Khaled Hosseini's genius that the second time you read them, chills will run down your spine as you think back to their first mention and contemplate everything the characters (and you, by proxy) have been through since then.<br /><br />Mariam and Laila are women of Afghanistan, born nearly twenty years apart and with disparate childhood experiences, but fate (aided by the bombing of Kabul) brings them together.  Initially enemies, their common sorrows eventually unite them as friends, and then as so much more.  I won't say any more about the plot; you'll want to find out on your own.<br /><br />Hosseini's characters are richly developed, the plot is intriguing, and his prose is elegant.  Despite the fact that you've probably never been to Afghanistan nor experienced a single one of Mariam and Laila's trials, you'll find you can relate to their pain and joy.  I highly recommend A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first, the book didn't grab my attention, but with all the great reviews, I decided to try it. I'm so glad I did!! I definitely recommend reading!
B0074YVW1G|5.0|Thank you, Susan Cain - what an amazing book.<br /><br />Hopefully, all of you with children and grandchildren, and those of you in Education in particular, will consider the material presented in this book.<br /><br />Many of the folks that this lady references, such as Brian Little,  are also doing phenomenal work.<br /><br />A stellar, trailblazing tome.
030758836X|5.0|Great read!! I would recommend this to anyone who has read Gillian Flynn books. This is my first, but it won't be my last.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although the plot is good, some of the language was too rough for me.  The characters are written strong and persuasive.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I'm a big Alicia Keys fan. I think she is very talented. This is not her greatest CD, but it's okay.
B008602KQI|5.0|This met all of my expectations. I missed the movie, so I purchased the DVD. Not the same as seeing it in the theater, though.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved this series. Couldn't get enough and wish there was more. But every story has an ending. Can't wait for the movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|our family likes to see who can solve the puzzles with the fastest time and least number of moves.  a very enjoyable game for all.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Just enough romance and mystery to make the history more fun.  I enjoyed it, found it difficult to read at times as war is not my favorite subject.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What can I say, the birds are back and angry at the pigs. Great game!!! Love it!!! I want more.
B007HACDLK|4.0|&#34;The Last Man&#34; is a good Mitch Rapp novel, but a little more formulaic than before.  Without giving away the tweaks, the legend is a little unbelievable in this setting, and most of the characters have moved from Flynn's normal development into caricatures of certain types.  Ending seems rushed.<br /><br />I am glad I read it, but some of the pre-&#34;American Assassin&#34; novels are much more interesting.
B000H6H81Q|5.0|Since childhood, have had a deep thing for ELEPHANTS, miniatures.  Needed this early guy for my collection.  ANYTHING by Schleich is ALWAYS soooo realistic and durable!...that's ANYTHING!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book I will  recommended this to every body !!! Can not wait for the third book to come out
B0091LS07E|5.0|Wonderful CD -Probably the BEST album by Alicia Keys to date. Entire album is a very introspective view of her life. Fame and financial success appears to be outside of the sensitivity and vulnerability of this superstar singer. Great album. Highly recommended.
0786867973|5.0|It's a cookbook to read as well as cook from. Much enjoyed over the holidays , hope she writes another.
1449410243|5.0|Gave this book to my wife for her birthday.<br />She loved it!<br />A lot of small cartoons in this book, all pretty funny :D
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It is a great show, it leaves you guessing all the time what will happen next. Just give it a try, I know it will capture you.
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|\\"I want to make something absolutely clear. If you thought there was some working group coming to the rescue well I want you to know that you're wrong. This is it. There is nobody else hidden away on some other floor. There is just us and we are failing.\\" -CIA Officer<br /><br />There's a reason Zero Dark Thirty was nominated for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, the movie is just that good. It may not be a movie for all audiences. If you go see this movie expecting to see a movie that looks like a James Bond or Jason Bourne action extravaganza, you might find yourself sorely disappointed. Likewise it's not a Tom Clancy techno thriller. Zero Dark Thirty is an honest drama showing the CIA's decade long struggle to find the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br />The main character of the movie is CIA analyst named Maya (played by Jessica Chastain); no last name is given. Maya enters the hunt for Osama Bin Laden at an undisclosed CIA facility where captured terrorists are being held and questioned. She arrives to witness the \\"enhanced\\" interrogation of Ammar, a courier for Saudi terrorists. Through Ammar's interrogation and many others, Maya begins to piece together information on Osama's network, learning of a senior courier named Abu Ahmed who had direct access to Bin Laden. Finding Abu  Ahmed in Pakistan is like looking for a needle in a haystack. But look Maya does, every spare moment, for a decade. Even though she's an analyst, not a field agent, the mere presence of an American woman in Pakistan puts her in danger. She survives an assassination attempt by Islamist gunmen. Some of her friends aren't so lucky.<br /><br />As I said earlier, don't expect this movie to be like most spy stories where enemy agents give themselves away and intricate conspiracies unravel before the hero's brilliance. Maya and her colleagues must sift through thousands of hours of interrogations and millions of \\"facts\\" to find just the ones that are true and relevant. It's no easy task. Just getting Abu Ahmed's real name takes years of painstaking research. Meanwhile, more attacks take place inside Pakistan, Afghanistan and Europe. Actual news footage of those events serves to show the passage of years. Once Abu Ahmed's name becomes known, there's still the matter of finding him in areas of Pakistan where American's are likely to be shot on sight. Kathryn Bigelow does a masterful job of showing the long hours and hard work behind the search. After 2 hours watching the un-glamorized process of intelligence gathering, the actual SEAL Team 6 takedown of Bin Laden could have been just an afterthought. But Bigelow's documentary-esque style gives the commando sequences an added authority.<br /><br />\\"I'm going to put you in that box, let me be honest, that box sucks, you don't want to go in that box.\\"<br /><br />There's been some hubbub claiming that the movie is pro torture. I'd just like to point out that director Kathryn Bigelow is hardly a Joel Surnow (24) or John Milius (Red Dawn, Dirty Harry). She a graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute and Columbia University who personally studied under liberal icons Susan Sontag and Milos Forman (Hair, People vs. Larry Flint, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Much of her work before the Hurt Locker was decidedly feminist. She hardly fits the profile of someone out to promote torture. But she had done thousands of hours of research for a film project on the Battle of Tora Bora. When word of Bin Laden's death became public, she shelved her completed screenplay for that movie and started on Zero Dark Thirty. The hours she spent researching Bin Laden, the CIA, Pakistan and Afghanistan for the unmade movie situated her ideally for telling the story of the CIA's hunt for Bin Laden. Add to that the unprecedented access to information she got from the Obama Administration. So much of the information comes from the \\"highest sources.\\" It's also confirmed by much of the written record including exhaustivework done by journalist Mark Bowden (The Finish: the Killing of Osama Bin Laden).<br /><br />Because of the controversy, I doubt that Zero Dark Thirty will sweep the Oscars. It may not be an easy movie for some people to watch. But it is a riveting, true-to-life, account of a piece of American history that deserves to be told. And director Kathryn Bigelow did a masterful job telling it.work done by journalist Mark Bowden (The Finish: the Killing of Osama Bin Laden).<br /><br />Because of the controversy, I doubt that Zero Dark Thirty will sweep the Oscars.

B005LAIHYU|5.0|It's just a really good movie. It's a little hard to take it seriously the whole time, but it's fun to watch, it has explosions and vampires. (Cool vampires.) It's just enjoyable to watch. You can either have fun with it and laugh or you can get caught up in the action and root for the characters.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard of this series but didn't read it until my teenaged grandkids had read it and told me how good they were. I've read the series twice now and enjoy it just as much each time. I downloaded the books on my Kindle so I had them all with me when I was traveling.

I tore through the original trilogy and have devoured everything she's written since. I've gotten my daughter-in-law and granddaughter hooked on the books also, and my granddaughter has proclaimed them &#34;better than Twilight&#34; which is high praise from a 13-year-old!

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this  Christian series for the moral they portray. It is a program that the whole family can watch and have fun with. I teaches good moral and daily life lessons that we all can learn from. It is clean; it doesn't have Hollywood dirty words or dirty pictures in it! It's clean, fun, and entertaining! We need more television programs like this that do not cause harm to our minds!

B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book explores the difference between introverts and extroverts in our society. The author's suppositions are really interesting and we get to explore how the two personality types influence our daily lives and our culture.<br />Ms. Cain includes multiple studies and so gets bogged down in technical details, but I can still recommend this book to anyone who is deals with people.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It was so nice to watch the 2 seasons I missed on TV ! It' was very easy and convenient to get it!

0765325950|4.0|A fitting end to the epic series. Not everything was resolved but I don't think anyone expected that at this point. The epic grand finale is there and it great. For the most part the pacing was good but I felt like it dragged in several places. At >900 pages this was a little long and there were certainly some scenes that could have been shortened or removed without taking away from the story. All in all an ending which is the most important thing.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I was not actually sure what to expect when I rented this movie.  I heard from some that this was a good movie, and I heard from others that it was only a musical.<br /><br />I found it entertaining, and I was even tapping my toe a time or two during the end of the movie.<br /><br />I would highly recommend watching it.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I wasn't expecting anything great out of this movie and wouldn't give it any awards, but it was lighthearted and fun, and it provided us with some good laughs!

0316228532|4.0|I must say that I really didn't expect much from J.K. Rowling's first adult novel. The plot sounded boring, and the first few chapters were extremely off-putting. But it actually wasn't half bad, though certainly not as good as Harry Potter. When the aforementioned Barry Fairbrother dies, the seemingly idyllic town of Pagford is thrown into turmoil. There's tons of controversy over this district called \\"the Fields\\", full of drug addicts, which many think shouldn't be part of Pagford. Though it seems like a typical English village, Pagford is home  to some pretty nasty people. On the surface, the plot seems unremarkable, but really, the novel was interesting, though also slow, in parts.    The annoying thing was that you practically couldn't read two pages without coming across either a lewd reference or a curse word (and by curse word, I mean the f-word or the like). And really, I think that though some of it was necessary, a lot could have been taken out, and a lot better novel could have been crafted.    However, The Casual Vacancy was - if not suspenseful- then certainly something that kept you reading, once you got into it. All of the characters were interesting, and the good part about it was that there were chapters narrated from the point of view of many of the characters. So, for example, \\"Fats\\", one of the teenage boys, is bullying this other girl, so you think he's evil. But obviously, he's not totally evil. He's just a person, like everyone else, who does some bad things, just like everyone else, and who has a good side, just like everyone else.    The writing wasn't nearly as good as in Harry Potter, but on its own wasn't bad. I really was kind of surprised that I liked it. I started the first few chapters perhaps a month before reading the whole thing, and immediately gave up The Casual Vacancy as a dud. But perhaps I shouldn't have been so hasty. There were some parts that made me squirm, and it certainly is an ADULT novel. Die-hard fans of Harry Potter will probably be disappointed. But on its own, it isn't a bad book.    My blog is at [...]

B008673ZAQ|2.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and was ready to discover more about them. But Eva went confident to extremely insecure in this book. She was beating herself up while Gideon brought her close to him then pushed her away again in an ultimate act of &#34;love.&#34;<br /><br />Maybe it is just me-my boyfriend and I can watch romances, mysteries, and thrillers and usually know the ending. I realized the ending pretty quickly and had no emotional connection to Geidon anymore-he was being a complete *ss. The last chapters I was rushing through the end becuse I was bored with the book.<br /><br />The ending was too adrupt for me and so when my friend hurried over to me and asked how I liked it I told her it didn't like it at all. The reason I'll read the third is if my friend let's me borrow it and spoils a little of it for me. So glad I didn't buy either book!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I was listening to the radio the other day and I happened to hear &#34;Stubborn Love&#34; by the Lumineers for the first time.  Immediately after listening to it I looked it up on Amazon as the group's style is very similar to that of Mumford and Sons, a group of which I'm a huge fan of.  After sampling some of the other songs of the Lumineers I realized that I wanted to purchase the entire album.  I can't seem to decide which of its songs I love most.  It's a great album, especially for being their first, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the new &#34;folksy&#34; type of rock that is being produced lately.

B000JIHP88|5.0|We just got this the other day and my son is mesmerized by it.  he's 2 months old and loves to watch his little buddies spin around.  my only complaint is that while it plays for about 20 minutes it plays the same song over and over again.  It doesn't seem to bother the baby though.<br /><br />Update:  We've had this for a few days now and I love it even more.  My son isn't much of a self soother, needed to be held and rocked to sleep then I could never put him down without waking him up.  This mobile keeps him happy and quiet long enough for him to fall asleep on his own in his crib!  That alone is worth its weight in gold to me!
B009B50QOU|5.0|Green Day rocks. It's hard for any group to keep the momentum going after so many hits and so much to compare to. Green Day continues to put out original music album after album. Getting a bit more \\"pop\\" on this album, but not in a negative way. As always, makes you want to get up and move. Gotta love Billy Joe.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just had to buy this; couldn't wait for the entire season.  Another terrific episode, the first of many I trust!
B00A12VW86|5.0|You can't deny Billy Joe's genius, if he could only leave out the expletives and sexual innuendo his last three albums (Uno, Dos, Tres) would be more widely received. Regarding Dos - to me - it's 50's bobby-sox, poodle-skirts meet wild leather-clad bad-boy style rock'n'punk. I think it's great, but not something you could play at a wedding unless cleaned up. Great music, very \\"catchy\\", original, and so Green Day. It makes you want to get up and dance and \\"let yourself go\\"!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book touched my soul! It is one of the best books I have read in a long time.....it is brilliantly written from the perspective of a dog, how he lives his life and what the life of his owner, Denny, is like, the hardships he must endure, the happy moments, everything! It doesn´t matter whether you have a dog, or if you once had a dog, this book will touch your heart in such a profound way...I want to believe that what the author presents us with is true, because if you´re feeling sad, your dog knows, if you´re happy your dog knows, he/she seems to understand better than anyone what you´re going through, and yes, even though they cannot speak, they offer something another human being sometimes is incapable of offering, their understanding and their unconditional love!<br />And I loved how everything is related to racing! I´m a Formula 1 fan, so it was a wonderful surprise to read the bits and pieces related to racing(when I first read the title I thought it referred to running, not racing a car, lol!)<br />If you haven´t read this book, go get yourself a copy, it is simply beautiful!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is a tear jerker, but an amazing story any \\"dog person\\" can relate to. Enzo the dog describes the ups and downs of his masters life. It makes you rethink how much your dog really knows. Suggested for anyone interested!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shade Freed was an amazing end to the trilogy! I would recommend these books to everyone. They are very well written and have a great plot line.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|This should never have been made into a movie; the book is a series of letters written by the mother to her husband. By definition, her story plays out in her thoughts and memories, expressed by the book's author in really elegant, often-convoluted language.  Her method of writing IS her character. The movie plucks events from the book without being able to show the thoughts and perceptions that caused them, so we never get a solid understanding of who these people are, and how complex they are.  The book is terrific.  Nothing wrong with the acting; Tilda Swinton and the actors who play her son do as good a job as they can with what they are given.

Moya Brennan is no stranger to the music industry and it shows on this CD.  We play it a lot and enjoy it more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is definitely a wonderful program.  I can't wait to purchase future episodes.  Thank you, Amazon, for making this available for us.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|My wife and I saw the movie at the theater first.  So it was good to read the book with faces to the characters.  I thought the movie did a good job of staying with the book.  Most movies I have seen do not stay with the book all that well.  Screen writers take a lot of liberties from an authors writings for Hollywood sake.  The book is a good read.  it flows in all six stories and ties it all together in the end.<br />David Mitchell is a good story writer and he keeps your attention.  lots of details you have to pay attention to what he trying to convey in the story line.  It is the kind of book you need to read several times.  I know I am going to read it again just to make sure I got all the points Mr. Mitchell is trying to get across.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Particularly enjoyed detective Blake and thought Bane was well casted. Worth watching but not as good as Dark Knight but still a good movie.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I'm usually a fan of this type of movie, but I found this one so very annoying. I couldn't let go of all the logic problems, all the stupidity, and all the TSTL moments. And I'm a Sci-Fi/Paranormal uber fan.<br /><br />Even the blood and gore annoyed me -- not because it was too gory, because it was just uninteresting. Yes, yes, he went splat, there was blood. Oh look, again -- same red, same splatter, nothing else. Oh look, it's the same. Oh, once more? Was there a sale? At Costco, you say? In bulk even. How nice for you that you didn't have to find a place to store them all.<br /><br />This will be a great Hate Watch title, so that's where it gets its second star. Watching with friends, throwing popcorn at the screen while you yell, that would be fun. But otherwise, it's a fail for me.
1451695187|5.0|A synopsis of this recent book was written as a Time Magazine cover article a couple of months ago; the book contains considerably more detail about the out-of-body experience of a brain surgeon who, from his vast knowledge of the workings of the brain, knows that he was brain-dead during this dramatic, vivid experience.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been watching the first 2 Seasons of Downton Abbey on Amazon Instant Videos.  With Amazon Prime, those were free.  I  loved every moment.  So much so, I watched each episode more than once.  When my husband heard from a friend how much they were enjoying it, he came home and suggested we start watching.  I didn't want to discourage him, so I just said yes and didn't tell him until almost the last episode of the 2nd season, once I knew he was hooked.<br />Now, full disclosure, Amazon requests that you review items you have ordered even if a person would know that only one episode of Season 3 has aired and I cannot possibly review the entire season.  But the first episode did not disappoint.<br />That is all I will say, because, if you haven't watched it, I don't want to spoil any of it for you. PBS did a special on Highclere Castle where the series is filmed and, so far, I cannot see that this is added to the Season 3 extras.<br />Between the amazing sets, the costumes, the many characters and plots / subplots.  It is worth watching multiple times for enjoyment and to clarify details that may have been missed during the first viewing.<br />The first episode was great and I am looking forward to subsequent episodes.  It looks like the entire Season is set for DVD release at the end of January, so I am hoping that the Instant Video (which we gladly pay for in the hope that we can watch the entire Season (probably more than once)on our own schedule once the entire season is released.<br />Definitely worth watching, more than once.  Buy it, either through Amazon Instant Videos or DVD set, you won't be sorry.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book had been on my radar for the better part of a year, due to the stellar reviews virtually everywhere.  I finally decided to read it when the &#34;Best of 2012&#34; lists came out and there it was again.<br />&#34;Kids with cancer - oh, joy&#34; was my first thought.  Hazel, Augustus and Isaac are great kids, wise beyond their years, with enough snark and sarcasm to make them real.  Using the fictitious book-within-a-book, An Imperial Affliction, to bring a philosophical bent without having the kids seem preachy or pompous was very effective.<br />A friend who thanked me for the recommendation called it &#34;a wonderful, quirky, contemplative book.&#34;  Well-said.<br />As a YA novel, it's a quick read, but a very, very slow ponder - this book really resonates.<br />Paraphrasing one of the characters (no spoilers) - in trying to make a mark and be remembered, we risk leaving scars.  This scar was worth it.

1423113462|5.0|PLEASE SEE REVIEW FOR BOOK 2.  i DON'T HAVE FOURTEEN MORE WORDS TO PUT INTO THIS. I AM WASTING YOUR TIME AND MINE.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It deeply concerns me that young women are reading this demented trash! I would hate to think that a college student might think to allow someone to mentally and physically control, degrade and abuse them. All in the name of love? I think not! Young ladies, please note that you cannot change or fix a man and you must not submit yourself to mistreatment for any reason, let alone to find love. This is not \\"Pandora's box\\", it is barbaric and inhumane! It is the absolute worst book I have ever read! One of the ladies in my book club chose this trilogy for our book club. Thank goodness I decided to purchase the first book to read before buying all three. I assure you, I will not waste my money, time or sanity reading the other two.
1423140591|5.0|THIS AND BK 1 WHICH IS LISTED BELOW FOR MY REVIEW WERE SPECIFICALLY LISTED BY HIUM FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS.  I SIMPLY DID WHAT I WAS TOLD BY HIS MOTHER, AND IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO!!!
B008FYZIVY|1.0|Downton Abbey seasons 1 & 2 incomplete..Missing segments..frustrating trying to put things together..Would like refund.  Understood this UK version was complete.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is a pretty good book, a bit too creepy for my tastes in mysteries, a bit reminsent of &#34;In Cold Blood&#34;.I did finish it and was surprised by the ending...all loose ends were tied up and it made sense.<br />There were some editing issues I noticed . They did not alter the storyline, but things I took notice of. A good editor could make this a great book.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries with some eerieness to them.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved the first book, which I read after seeing the movie. Now I can't wait to finish the trilogy. Not too emotional or teenybopperish, and very believable for a futuristic tale.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I love this app. I use it to distract my 1 yr. old nephew when he gets bored. It can record what you're saying and repeats it back in a funny way.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|I bought this for the BLU Ray and it did not disappoint.  Loved the concert and the audio was excellent!
B008C20TDG|5.0|While pretty much any diet change in which you remove the processed foods is universally agreed to be healthier, I think these concepts make a lot of sense. Despite what other people say of the Paleolithic diet on other websites, at no point are we encouraged to eat as much meat as possible. Also, Melissa and Dallas encourage you to experiment with your experiences, all they ask is for 30 days and then decide what works for you. I love the openness, honesty, and frankness. It is refreshing that they don't believe their system is the end all, be all, they let you decide for yourself, but they have done a decent bit of research to support their claims and decisions (well, maybe they do, but it never feels forced).
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is an eye opening STORY of the horrific events that occurred during the holocaust .  deRosnay was able to make those unspeakable horrors come to life through this story of a 10 year old girl.  The history of  the human race is filled with many  tragic events, but this  is one of  the most despicable  atrocities EVER RECORDED!  I loved the way de Rosnay allows us to witness this terrible time through the eyes of a child, and shows us the snowballing effects that are still occurring today and on GENERATIONS  TO COME One of  THE BEST BOOKS I'VE  EVER READ!
B000TGCR38|5.0|It is a shame that a lot of people do not know about this movie.  Great acting and over-all great movie.  Carice van Houten is an excellent actress.  Friends have watched this movie at our home and wanted to know where they could buy it from.<br />M. Cooper
B0001I55NS|5.0|Love historical fiction and love archaelogy. Appreciated a more realistic depiction of this time period. It wasn't a neat, clean, sanitary or polished time.
143911000X|5.0|Item came as described (brand new), and what a wonderful book!! Great to give to my guy friends, and since I love How I Met Your Mother, it was fun to read myself.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I am on the road a lot and there are times I need documents scanned. With this I can scan them, send them and have my work done in minutes!!! WELL worth!!!
B006FYHTFO|5.0|Great addition to the movie. All the great music is here. If you love the movie, you'll love the soundtrack.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it because you can join games and build houses and fly.My brother and my dad like it too.I bet my friend would like it too.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I love super heroes. This was a bit over the top for me and quite predictable, and oh, the testosterone!
B0083SBJXS|2.0|there was a problem with the movie, the blue ray one is just perfect, works awesome, the digital copy obviously is perfect, the problem is the DVD one, It starts to jump in betwin the movie, and in on e point on the best part of the fight it just got stuck, unfortunately I'm unable to ask for a change, but is a good point for you to take care off.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fabulous book!  Mind boggling and I catching with a great ending! Anyone  that likes love stories will love this book.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|After receiving the case and putting on our kindle fire, it functions as it should. The only recommendation is maybe to add clips or locks when putting the case in the upright position to put on the desk/table.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this amazing book. It was full of adventure, love and understanding. Make sure you have time to read because you will not be able to put the book down for a second.
B001ULKOI6|5.0|I have always like this group music.  The download went very smooth. Looking to buy more of there songs soon.
B007V65R54|5.0|People who expect every page to contain insight will be disappointed, but everyone will find at least one chapter worthy of remembering. I enjoyed how much better I understand weather and earthquake predictions now than before. I already knew about baseball, chess I didn't really care about, and his climate change chapter I found very muddled in its reasoning. But overall you are sure to enjoy at least one chapter of the many.  Then the overarching message should be useful to anyone: how to properly approach making predictions.  Most top-selling books offer a lot less.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|love it so much. has so much to do. it also keeps my children busy. you don't have to buy things like other games! saves me money honey
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The whole family loved this.  We had a great time watching it.  It kept us laughing all night, even after we finished watching the moving.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|It didn't work at my church which was my only perpose. Works better on other software! I don't recommend this app.
B0043OUZW2|5.0|Exciting music from a great talent! This girl is gonna rock the world. More please. Great guitar licks and vocals from a beauty.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|lame predictable, lost interest in it soon. Wahlberg is wasting his talent on this one. what a plot could do for it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|my girls love it, they have so much fun playing for free,  I think is a not violent game is just fun.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent sequel, cant wait for the 3rd!<br />I feel like I am right there with the characters going through all their emotional experiences. Amazing
B0001GNJQ0|3.0|Love the movie, shipped quickly and in new condition, but made the mistake of ordering region 2 instead of region 1. Ordered a replacement but now I'm stuck with a region 2 lying about
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have enjoyed this ap and find it easy to use.  I appreciate the reminders it sends me every day.<br />I also like the &quot;catch me up&quot; feature.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I hate to say it, but I think I like this more than the first one. This movie is AMAZING. Robert Downey Jr. kills it in this.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic.  I loved how brutal the action is and the actors were all perfect.  Karl Urban as Judge Dredd is seriously such an unexpected revelation and Olivia Thirlby was such a surprise.  She has grown up a ton since playing the best friend in Juno and I can't wait to see more of her.  The story was very simple yet cool as hell, very well-paced and had plenty of clever moments and the effects were gorgeous.  It got me hooked very early into the movie and it didn't disappoint once.  It's definitely piqued my interest for the character more and I'm gonna have to go and read some of the original comics.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it is my absolute favorite. Every time you turn the page something amazing, or devastating, or something that makes you feel like your there with them happens. Everyone should read this book.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|My girls, ages 3 and 4.5 both did this movie. they asked to watch it almost daily for the first few weeks after they opened it from Christmas.  As a dad, I found it mildly entertaining. I dont think it was the strongest movie of the Fairy franchise, but over all it had a good plot, some emotionally pulling moments, and lacked the typical Disney kill off of a mom.<br /><br /> I would recommend this movie to other parents of fairly loving girls.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Just an odd, quirky movie. I rented it to see where it was filmed in Rhode Island, but I didn't recognize a lot of the areas.
B005LAII80|5.0|Loved every minute of it, in a world where R rated action movies are a thing of the past, Dredd was exactly what I had hoped for. No crummy kid sidekick, no learning to care and gain a heart of gold in the end, this was just another day for Judge Dredd. I can only sit and hope for a sequel.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|One of if not the best movie of ancient Rome and its use of gladiators! Crowe and Phoenix are at their very best!!!
B000AA4JMU|4.0|I really loved this musical and I hoped to save money by getting both DVD and CD.  I was surprised when I didn't receive a CD.  But love the DVD even if its two sided.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Once I started watching I couldn't stop!  This is the greatest show this side of watching the Royal Family themselves!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Love the ap, BUT it constantly crashes with a black screen.......have unloaded, reloaded, and it still crashes........too bad, I love the game otherwise....
B00338QELU|5.0|Excellent book. Well researched. So interesting. I couldn't put it down. I looked forward to having time to continue reading this book each time I had a chance. So well written.
0307744434|5.0|This book showed up in one of the many emails I get from Amazon every week.  Normally I delete them without opening, but with my Thanksgiving break coming up I checked one of them out.  I'm glad I did because I would not have found this book otherwise.  I was expecting a standard love story in a somewhat different setting, but what I got was so much better!<br /><br />I loved the whole idea of the circus. Everything about it, from the tents, to the clock, to the bonfire was enchanting.  The romance was there, but, for me, it paled in comparison to the the fantastic imagery and rich detail of the circus.  This is a place that I would love to go.  I actually found myself hoping that this book will be made into a movie the whole time I was reading.  I'd love to see the magic within brought to life.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, but this is hands down the best book I read in 2012.  I'd highly recommend it.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I found it interesting from the first to the last page, well paced, full of history, loved it! One thousand pages but not long enough.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. it really makes you keep looking. It`s scary and exciting.it's makes you want to see them get away from the walkers. it's also sad when the little girl came out of the barn.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun, moves fast, give options for game and is playable on the go!  Love it!  Try it!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I don't usually buy whole albums from artists that I've never heard of, but I'm so pleasantly surprised by this one!  Sure, not every song is great, but the majority are.  This album makes me want to move - run, dance, workout... I love it.  Very good buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. It's awesome to play but it still needs regular crafting. And I don't get to play on other servers and I don't know how to update it
B007MU85D0|5.0|I took a chance on this album (it was an amazon recommendation from another album I purchased - Imagine Dragon's &#34;Night Visions&#34; - which is very good, by the way), and I'm so glad that I did.  It's SO nice to put on an album and enjoy it all the way through.  Sure, not every song is absolutely amazing, but a majority of them are.  It's been a nice album to play for when I'm working on paperwork or something that I would consider monotonous.  I find it calming, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm glad I took the risk.  It was well worth the purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Beautiful. Keeps you hooked until the very last page, and not your typical kind of plot. Very much enjoyed this.
0805047905|5.0|This is a classic and (in my opinion) necessary book for preschool-1st grade classrooms.  My students really enjoy reading this book.  I love the rhymes and easy reading format.  Children are quickly able to fill in the blanks and &#34;read&#34; it for themselves.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so deep and honest, it makes you feel grateful for what you do have. Definitely a page turner to the end!
B001F290E4|5.0|I am really enjoying listening to Soul by Seal.  I espescially love the song &#34;Rain&#34;, it is definately my favorite.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Mr Kyle tells his story in a way that puts you right there beside him.  I am honored to know him, through his story.  To all those that came before, and all that have served since, I thank you for your service and sacrifice.  Semper Fidelis.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I do love the songs on the CD, but am dissappointed that the song &#34;Fade Into You&#34; is not on it, though at least they made up for it by giving the song free on a MP3 download.
B009XWD02G|1.0|This thing sux i tried clicking on tha song and it let out a big fart don't get it &gt;:C
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this product and so did my young friend . He now plays with my phone more than i do now. WIll probably be purchasing the full version very soon .
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I have read a book on my kids del fire hd and it  seemed SHORT.  I have read the whole series and this is best one yet.  I am a girl so younow
B007549W62|2.0|I did not buy this thru Amazon.  I should have come here first though to see what the  reviews were.  I had hoped for a film about the apocolypse, but this one is more of  porn and violence than anything else.  There is a definite decline into madness by each character represented in this tale with absolutely no hope of a future.  Gives one the sense of such hopelessness that if this ever occurs, one would be better off killing oneself, immediately, rather than going through any length of survival.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is one of the apps I must have on any platforms. Its constant improvements in each update always amazed me. It makes organizing info much easier.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is about this boy name Greg Heffley and how he is trying to escape with stuff like he put posters on the wall at his school and when it started to rain the green dye bleeded out and got caught but started to run and now the police was involved. The other thing about thisbook was that he had to deal with his brothers  and his parents near and on Christmas. Oh he also wants to go to juvenile or jail but not exactly.<br /><br />A·K·A· He lost electricity but not actually because his little brother messed with the fuse box.<br /><br />I really LOVEDDDDDDDDDD this book
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Simply that.  Just ok! Never felt very connected to the characters and the story was simply not that compelling. The sound was out of sync with the lip movement. I left and came back two additional time to try to fix the problem, but no success.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book. Read it a thousand times. Greatly written I love everything about this book, the romance the action the sentiment and on and on... anyone who needs a book to read, read this one. And the whole series.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I first saw Miracle on 34th Street with Sabastian Cabot as Santa in the early 70's. But after seeing the original version, well it can't be beat. The facial expressions from Natalie Wood are 'priceless'!!!
B002GNTDTI|5.0|This is one of my top ten favorite television series.  For me, there are far more highs than lows.  How much you'll enjoy it depends on the way in which you enjoy Superman as a character.  If you see him as two-dimensional, campy and strictly comic-book silliness, you'll probably not enjoy the series.  However, if you see Superman as more of a mythic hero in the classic sense, then this is a very well done coming of age story.  If you know nothing about Superman and enjoy a story with strong character development, you'll probably enjoy it.  If nothing else, the series features some great soundtracks and the score from the two different composers is outstanding.  It's DC Comics approved.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|There is nothing more to say than this is some of his best and most artistic work to date. Thanks!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Gripping thriller that is written so well. Connelly is a master of storytelling and dialogue. You won't put this book down until you are done...and will be hoping for more!
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Great debut album from an artist with a terrific range and style that I predict we will be hearing from for many years to come.
B00170DEM8|5.0|What's not to like with this cast? Cute story, great songs (Be careful, that's my heart. . . ) and dynamic dance numbers. Love to watch this movie at Christmas time or any time of year!
B001EC3JME|5.0|This flashlight Holster will hold flashlights from small to large flashlights.  If you have the small Maglite flashlight to the larger Maglite (3 or 4 D Cell Battery) this holster is for you. It will expand to large and small flashlights using elastic bands that allow it to expand and also keep your flashlight secure.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is a awesome thing!!!! There is even videos of him!!!!!!!!!!! But it is sad when he doesn't get his candy.
0765325950|3.0|After finishing the Sword of Truth series, I looked for another epic fantasy series. A friend told me about the Wheel of Time, which sounded intriguing. I slogged through the first book, never really getting into it, but liked the second one better. After that, the series was hit-and-miss. The problem I had was I didn't care for any of the characters, and the villain was dull. The Shadow (or Dark One or whatever it's called) is so abstract that it just never felt like a threat.<br /><br />Cut to the last book, which is all about getting rid of the Dark One. I just couldn't muster any interest in whether the heroes succeeded. I didn't care if any of the main characters died. I blame Jordan for this, because he kept insisting on qauntity over quality, introducing hundreds of boring, pointless characters in each book. I'm not sure why he ever thought that was a good idea, but it completely ruined the reading experience for me every time a stupid new character was added. That's just bad writing, and his wife/editor should have been more strict.<br /><br />I never felt Jordan knew how to tell a story, and his series has always been mind-numbingly dull, but the Sanderson-penned books were actually pretty fun. Unfortunately, \\"A Memory of Light\\" is too repetitive to really enjoy, with too many Trolloc battles that don't really add to the story. It's like watching a Star Wars movie where the entire film consists of Jedi fighting battle droids. And I'm talking the droids that are so easy to kill. It's just dull. This book is the literary equivalent of a Michael Bay film. After a few minutes you just want it to end.
0375869026|5.0|A very inspiring book, for children and adults. The treatment of others with disabilities is very important. Others should put themselves in that persons place..
B005FITILO|4.0|I enjoyed watching Young Adult and thought the characters that Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt portrayed were entertaining. The movie starts out with the character Mavis Gary (played by Charlize) who is struggling with her career as a writer and overall emotional well being. She soon decides to pack up her briefcase with her small dog and travel back to her home town where she grew up at in Minnesota, looking to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend, who is now happily married and has a newborn daughter.<br /><br />The first night back in town Mavis Gary bumps into an old school acquaintance, Matt Freehauf (played by Patton Oswalt). Both having emotional baggage, they feed off each other to alleviate their loneliness and insecurities. These two characters I thought were the most interesting of the movie.<br /><br />Without giving away anything else such as where the movie goes, and what transpires, I will say that I enjoyed the story because it had a realness to it. Good Job Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt.<br /><br />And as a side note, the character \\"Beth Slade\\", (played by Elizabeth Reaser) did a good job playing the envied new wife and mother of the baby. Not many parts but definitely made an impact.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it !! Could not put it down read it in three days. My friends were o so right  awesome
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I have to press it harder than I should on my tablet for it to work properly and the bottom edges of the cap are sharp so it's a little uncomfortable.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Little did I suspect when I started to read this book how hooked I would become on this mysterious small mountain town that holds the deepest of secrets. Why is this town in such isolation? Why is it so difficult to leave? What deeper secrets are hidden under this seemingly innocent town? Here I am at. 3AM learning the final and most satisfying of answers. A coded meaning as to what the future may hold.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|I like Nicki Minaj so I already knew I would like this CD, I recommend it for anybody who is a fan of hers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|is it ok this would not be my first choice I would spend my time on a better game than this
B0086449YA|5.0|Love Mark Knopfler!  Rock and old Celtic tradition mixed, with great blues guitar.  Simple and elegant, evocative and lush.  Enjoy!
B009PU2SX8|5.0|I discovered Gary Clark Jr. when I was flipping channels and stumbled upon him playing live at a festival on Palladia. Bought his Bright Lights EP and couldn't wait to buy Blak & Blu when it came out. Aside from his driving blues guitar songs, he also comes with some soul and R&B. Good stuff.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Like Band of Brothers this is a great series and is worth buying and watching, great for WWII fans, recommend.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm not sure what genre this book technically fits into, but it was different than other books I have read, by far. Just when I thought I had things figured out, things would go in an unexpected direction.<br /><br />This was a fun and refreshing read that I recommend to everyone. I will be looking into other works from this author.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I love Mitch Albom since I read his  Five People You Meet in Heaven. I have loved all of his other books, but this one did not go to the places those other pieces did. His short, concise sentences I think we're deliberate though. I think this book was lacking his usual luster, but I believe he kind of write it that way. Regardless it was an engaging story & I did read it quickly for that reason. I was looking to be moved the way I was by his other works and was sorely disappointed. This book was good, but not great.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book held my attention the entire time. It's a fascinating story about a important event in our history. I was sad to have it end. I have to say I'm not a Stephen King reader but because of the subject matter of this book I thought I would try it. This will become one of your favorite books!!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|something I couldn't relate to at all and so very unreal for the majority of society. It took me a very long time to read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Honestly, the best book I've read in a long time. That's all there is to say. I'm absolutely infatuated. Only 2 days to read this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect when doing math homework. so get it today!  lalalala la la sing a happy song cool and awesome free!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This was a great buy from Amazon. My husband loves Indiana Jones and all of the collections are in here. An excellent gift for Indiana Jones fans!
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This movie is truly all over the place with emotions and covers just about what all or some moms have been through.. and Dads too! I loved it
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Real Lifeproof case, just $20 cheaper than ordering from Lifeproof site. Owned about a month now. Water tested as instructed by Lifeproof with no problems. Camera works well with cover. Screen not as quick to pick up finger movements with case on, but that's true with any good cover. Daughter loves it.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|My son loved this! He uses it about every day! he even adds it into some of the stuff he builds with his legos! I couldnt be more happy with this. Only down side, USB charger only.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|great gift
B0055SWM08|4.0|...you get the idea.  A challenging test of reasoning and visuospatial skills,  this could be sold as a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; brain exercise game package.  (Also great for rehabbing tron a concussion,  for those of us who play contact sports or are just accident- prone.)  The pain in the (butt) : getting prodded to sell the game to my friends and relatives on Facebook and here on Amazon Kindle/Google Play.  This is more appropriate for a non-paid app.  I'll be checking the reviews on the new version before I pay to work for the developers.  All in all,  highly recommended game if you can deal with the hassle of begging.
B0057VDGNK|4.0|I thought that this album would have had more songs on it.  The first 3 songs were great, the rest of the album is song compositions from the movie score.  Not very interesting.
B0086700CM|5.0|My kids really love this game. So when they were fighting over who got to play it on thier phones I had to install it on mine so they all could play. My kids are really into this game
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is addicting and fun. It's hard to stop playing it. The game play, sound and graphics are awesome. I highly recommend this game to a friend.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This app far better than winamp.  This is more stape and alot easier to use.  Great app.  I highly reccomend.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|The movie moves along kind of slow, but it was entertaining just the same. I think Clint Eastwood is remaking himself from a tough action hero into a cantankerous old man who does have a soft side if you dig long and hard enough.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A would recommend this book to everyone who likes John Grisham's work. A very believable story. I really enjoyed it.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I don't like it at all because I never got to play it.  I thought it sour be good. because it made number 1 on the store.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great fun and skill game to play. Moves a little slow but I like it alot.  Would recommend it to any gamer. Thanks.
0307454568|4.0|I really liked the series. What I liked best about this book was that even though the author had planned 10 in the series and passed away after the 3rd, it still ends with a satisfactory conclusion to the story.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Solitaire is Solitaire. I love to play it but maybe it's the way the cards are set up. I guess I miss a little more action in a game. I'm sure whoever likes to play this card game will. Maybe I'm not giving it enough credit because I do like to play.
B009FRG8IW|4.0|I love this album. The music is great for working out. I just wish it sorted more easily on my MP3 player.
B0086700CM|2.0|I can only give this one 2 stars right now. I haven't spend enough time on this to master it. I keep sending the poor runner into the pit. Need to find the clue in how to keep him on the right track.  Could be a great game if I knew how. Thanks.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful trilogy! Will it continue...please let the story line continue! I want to know more about Christian and Ana as they raise their children and how good he is as a father. This book is not just about the arousal of the sex scenes but rather a great story line.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Action was good. Kept moving right along. I do though have a bit of a question of the vamps and the time period. Or maybe it's just the connection of Abe and the vamps. The video was great but the audio was a little weak. All in all an enjoyable movie.
1616960922|4.0|For fans of fantasy but havent made the plunge into Brandon Sanderson's several epic fantasies this is a great starting point. Set in the same universe as Elantris this book follows the story of a woman on borrowed time having to use her skills to help an empire.<br /><br />This was a great book in terms of character. You really get into the character and what her skills and thoughts are about the life around her and how she observes and weaves her way into the people around her.<br /><br />I read this on a weekend and I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you are wanting to read something by Brandon Sanderson without taking the leap into his other larger works.<br /><br />This was no means his best work that claim, in my opinion, still goes to the Mistborn trilogy but this is a great story.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I wanted to see this becuase I could never get to see it on television. While watching this I was flooded with all kind of emotions when the various episodes were being watched. I must admit there are some points in the show where it became boring, but it picked up and got me glued to the screen once more. I give it a good thumbs up!
030758836X|2.0|This a book NOT to like...I was looking forward to reading it after all the hype however, this is definitely not a<br />'feel good' book in any kind of way and at the end, you're left with a rotten feeling, kind of like no faith in humanity. Pick something with more literary appeal and more worth your time reading....
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've followed both Jon Schmidt and Steven Sharp Nelson individually, and they are both excellent musicians in their own right.  Together, though, they create something remarkable: classical music for the average person. These songs are mostly \\"mash ups\\" of famous classical pieces and modern rock favorites, resulting in music that truly transports. The Youtube videos are delightful, but I'm glad I've got a copy of this music now that can go offline with me, too. Saying \\"I highly recommend it\\" is an understatement.
B00006LSZ4|5.0|My daughter and her dog love this.  They BOTH sat and watched the whole thing.  Cutest thing i ever saw!!
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I thought the action was fast paced without being overdone.  The problem with the movie is, of course, there were 3 others without Aaron Cross.  With the many referrals back to Jason Bourne in this version, it was almost like they were asking him to come back.<br /><br />Had I not seen the other three movies, I would have enjoyed this one more.<br /><br />I think if this were the first one of the series or a new movie altogether, it would have had more impact.  But alas, with 3 Bourne movies its belt, it was not as good as I had hoped.
0811874192|5.0|After getting a thumbs up from an artist friend, I ordered this for my daughter. She liked it very much
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this one is great of course, has plenty of levels to keep you busy. why can't all the games have tons of levels.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love to do mahjong it is good for eye and hand coordination.  Some of them are really hard and I try to do them as fast as I can.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted was a funny film. Raunchy but funny. My 70 year old mom was considering watching it. I would not recommend that. Not the demographic that this movie appeals to. Still I think Seth McFarlane's directorial debut is a success.
B005LAIGRS|1.0|This movie had about 10-15 lines of actual dialogue.  The rest was chase and fight scenes.  The story held together for the first 10 minutes or so, but it completely fell apart once the random bad guys show up and start the movie long chase.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|Just finished Knightfall vol 1. Absolutely loved it, the story was great,awesome battles with villains , and I loved Robin's conflicting feelings bout the new Batman. Can't wait to start reading vol 2.
B009PAETCG|5.0|My kids love this game.  I like it as well get for hand eye cordination.  I would recommend for any age.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. The writing style took a little getting used to, but then it wouldn't have been the same in regular book format. The characters are fantastic and I was so sad when I finished it.  I felt like I had lost a group of good friends.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good app. Would have liked a little more challenges but overall a good gamming experience. i would recommend this game to others.
0061997811|5.0|I bought this for my daughter (10) who is crazy about H.P.  She loves all of the special &#34;souvenirs&#34; and behind the scenes information.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show, its hard to stop if you just watch one episode cuz you want to find out whats going to happen next.
B00198X0VS|5.0|I wanted this movie for my collection of men in black I love it my kids love it we sit and watch it together a family movie night
B0092SPYQG|4.0|If your into this style of music &#34;The Connection&#34; will not disappoint. Nice driving beat that keeps you interested but not so hard that you feel like you are getting beat up (or want to beat up somebody).
B000VDDWE2|5.0|I wanted this movie for my collection of men in black I love it my kids love it we sit and watch it together a family movie night
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is just like the game you play in the arcades. Only this time you want to shake your device because it is solo frustratingly addicting! Love this game!!!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I wanted this movie for my collection of men in black I love it my kids love it we sit and watch it together a family movie night
B001UV4XI8|4.0|Great movie, not the best in the series but solid. David Yates does a thing where bunch of the picture looks really good, breathtaking really, but when he cuts to the CGI castle, he darkens it up so much that it's really not pleasing to the eye. I haven't got to read this book yet so I'm not sure how faithful it is.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|I wanted this movie for my collection of men in black I love it my kids love it we sit and watch it together a family movie night
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|Great movie, would recommend. Shipping was fast seller was great. A+
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Another great baseball movie.  Helps us remember that it is a game of more than just numbers.  You've gotta have heart!
0689853637|5.0|OLD OR YOUNG, ALMOST ANYONE WOULD FIND THIS BOOK A LITTLE TREASURE. BEAUTIFULLY<br />CRAFTED AND A KEEPSAKE TO BE ENJOYED YEAR AFTER YEAR. SET IT UP ON YOUR COFFEE<br />TABLE EACH HOLIDAY SEASON FOR ALL TO ENJOY.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Thankful that I rented this rather than actually spending money to own it. Im guessing the special effects would be awesome in 3-d . The characters are underdeveloped , hard to relate to and difficult to follow. The plot  alone is good . The product as a whole is not.  None of the characters form a personality .  Where there could be interesting character developments they chose to back track and go directly the opposite of what they have laid out . Example ; the main Dr  is not religious and has dialog with the other Dr yet he has a cross tattoo . Not one character is believable . The robot is supposed to be \\"nonliving \\" with out feelings yet he comes across human ,maybe even evil . Ms Vickers (Charlese Theron ) character takes on the persona of a jello mold . No true emotion . For the most part several random events are thrown together haphazardly . The most insulting part was the impromptu Caesarian section .( I have had three of those procedures) First a 15lb squid pops out of a flat sunken in stomach . They could have shown it getting larger ,all I saw was her screaming and a lump that moved a crossed her stomach . Secondly you cant walk after your guts are ripped out and stapled back together ,no less run and fight off aliens .  Giving birth naturally one tentacle at a time would be more believable . (Speaking from experience the pain of childbirth does not end with contractions nor is it not present because you had a Caesarian. Then at the very end (I guess this is the tie in to Alien ) made no sense . The opening scene made no sense and tied into to nothing . Big alien dude eats his lunch and falls apart into a river ? The cave paintings cracked me up because it looked like a guy skeet shooting .  Dont waste your time or money . Im a huge Sci-fi fan . Watch something else . Oh and if I remember correctly Alien the movie does not take place in the future yet the alien is born in the future.  I dont know maybe they were planning on the movie theater to be filled with people who were wasted and just happy with the 3d and could care less about having a plot or characters ? oh I gave it a 1 because they make you so count this as a minus 5 .
1591840562|3.0|It's is not what I expected, but it was informative and helpful.  I'm glad i took he time to read the book.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I came into this series in the middle, read to the end, and now am backtracking to the first book.  Kevin Hearne is a genius at exploring the interconnected play between Mythos.  Just as Americans are not a homogeneous people, so too does he weave a tapestry of belief systems together that make for exceptional reading.  Plus the references to star wars are sheer delight.  He has succeeded the role of the late great Roger Zelazny in the first person narrative.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Ted had such high expectations after the initial previews were launched - so high they were almost impossible to live up to. In the end, Ted is a solid comedy that is absolutely worth watching if you're a fan of Seth Macfarlane's humor. If you live in the Northeast, you'll appreciate the Boston humor as well. Definitely a much funnier movie when you re-watch it since you pick up on so much more of the language and small jokes that are often overlooked.
8866130915|5.0|Or so they say! Though I've not tried any other pocket planners, this one is definitely the way to go. It fits right in my back pocket and even through a whole day doesn't get warped or cracked. The pages are beautiful, it's handy, and it even comes with a pocket in the back. I will be buying one of these for years to come.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut The Rope<br /><br />This game is good for problem solving, hand eye coordination and the little character is so cute.  I an really loving this game.  My daughter told me about it and she was right.  It is addicting and really fun to play.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|The grandchildren like it and it keeps them busy during grocery shopping but I don't get what the big rage is all about.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!  This was a great book, very captivating from start to finish. A must read!
B00881VLCE|1.0|The set up and layout was fine. But the kindle fire is  just too small to comfortably play this game. I'm sure it would be better on a tablet rather than an e-reader.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great storyline and graphics. Plenty of hidden objects which is why I got it anyway.  Addictive, couldn't put it down. Ready for the next.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|The concept is interesting but the game doesn't have a &#34;help&#34; section. Found pages but coudn't pick them up. You have to have facebook or twitter for that. Why should I have to go to a social networking site just to get help.
B00884GR0W|4.0|This game is very good, the graphics are nice. It is like minecraft with an ego twist,with quests you have to complete. The only nag I have with it is the controls are iffy and sometimes it crashes on me.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is  a nice quick read. The Characters are defined and you get to know them personally and become emotionally attached to them. I love the fact that the language of flowers is literally used. And it intertwins modern verses victorian times, which gives you the feeling of appreciation for times past. Becasue I am not familiar with scientific names of flowers, it causes some bumps in the reading, though it is not dwelled upon in the writing.<br />The descripition of a foster child's life is lightly touched on, and the struggles of the child being let go- into the real world helps the reader understand what they may face when doing so. The mother/daughter/lover relationships are increidibly strong and well written.<br />It's a nice read, and a good story, not long, boring or predictable and I feel a reader would enjoy this book as a casual pick up as needed or a fill in for inbetween readings
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The quality of this package is amazing. I have read in some other reviews that they encountered occasional problems with some portions of the disks. We have watched 2 already and have not encountered any issues. It is sharp, colors are great, you can switch between enhanced special effects and the original. We did both, but mostly have watched with the enhanced and I am amazed at how much detail I have been noticing. What an amazing experience to see it all on a big screen in such an amazing sharpness and color! Definitely worth the price! Highly recommend!
1250006341|5.0|THI SERIES FROM BBC, IS THE BEST YET, I'VE WATCHED THIS OVER AND OVER, ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, AND ENJOYED VERY, VERY MUCH  THANK YOU
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works great and I would recommend it. Just wish I know where I put it????<br />It is compact and easy to loose for me that is. If you get one just remember where you leave it.<br />Thinking a little more about this......I bet my Son &#34;borrowed it&#34;.<br />I will buy another one and tie a big yellow ribbon on it, maybe I will be able to hold onto that one longer than a month.
B0007PALZ2|4.0|I watch this movie once a year since it was released, without fail...It has everything...<br />sci-fi, romance, action, violence, humor and intelligence...love it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Want to side load google chrome, youtube, and flash player? How bout most of your other android apps? Its possible with ES file Explorer.  Try it, what have you got to lose except silk browser?
B000KN7BIQ|5.0|If you havent seen this classic by now, you do not know what you have missed...Brilliant acting, plot, twists,<br />humor... Robert Shaw was only better in Jaws...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My boyfriend and I absolutely loved all three seasons of Walking Dead.  We watched all of them in a weekend and finished up thru the next week.  Can't wait for season 4 to come out.  The only downfall is that we have to watch ever episode one at a time per week.  It is so addicting.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|Tarantino's first screenplay, and a ridiculouis roster of stars and great actors...This is a gem of a movie, because it has<br />so many scenes of black humor, and intense, gratuitous violence and indulgence...With an undertone of bizzare romance, and Tarantino-esque fantasy...
B008578JI0|5.0|Great movie.  Watched in while waiting for flight at the airport.  Would recommend it to anyone especially those from that time period.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter 1st season was so well done and well written, it became an addictive must see for me to this day, 7 seasons later!
B0027I93U6|5.0|A great TV Show. Slow at first, but it get's better as it goes on. I LOVE amazon instant video so I can watch Shower on my TV.
6305511055|4.0|This movie is as urgent and timeless today as it was forty years ago... Watch and learn how dark forces within our govt operate...<br />A must see...
B002L9N4F6|4.0|Wish it were a little cheaper but it was fun with the chocolate smelling paper and the feather...it was cute
B000V86OKG|4.0|Loved it so much,,,but it was just a tad below season 1 standards...don't let that stop you in any way from watching it at all!
B005SCSL56|5.0|This book was by far one of the greatest books I have ever read. It's very captivating and brings a tear to your eyes , I know it did make me cry anyway !!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story made me feel like I was in high school again,first crush and all that,  then went in an extremely different and unexpected direction. Not that it was a bad thing, but strong subject matter. I don't want to give any of the story away because I hate when I read reviews and they describe the whole story for you, but the ending was a total &#34; Awwwwww&#34; moment. So sweet.
B007SGM084|5.0|In the beginning I was turned off by the way  Mr. Grey treated his submissives and I couldn't get pass the 1st book. My co-worker kept telling me to get through the first book. Thereafter, I must admit, once I found out Mr. Grey's story, I could understand some of his pain. In spite of what he went through to get to true love, he's a real ladies man.  Mrs. Grey was willing to stand by her man.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If I could've given this book six stars I would.  Plot twists everywhere. An incredible love story. I am in love with Dean Holder.  I laughed and cried...sometimes at the same time.  Amazing!!!!
B001C08RHA|4.0|The timing of shipping and delivery was good.  The case was a little chipped, but I suppose that's what you get when you purchase used items.  I haven't checked the quality of the actual DVD yet, but it didn't look like there were any scratches on the disc, so here's to hoping it works well!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This author is easy to read.  She has a relaxed, unassuming style with just enough details to keep things moving.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|How much do I love thee? Let me count the ways?<br /><br />So we all know that zombies are the new &#34;vampires&#34; of popular culture.  They appear to be all over the place.  Yet, when it comes actually good zombie shows versus those that are just trying to make a few bucks by jumping on the band wagon, it can't be denied that the Walking Dead is undeniably the best zombie craze film out there.  I am a huge fan and can't wait for the show to return next month.
1609611543|3.0|Some good information but I was startled to learn that our wheat has changed so much and could be the cause of many complications to our health.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Serial Murderer who kills serial murderers?  While it might justify his killing, it still makes people question, &#34;is what Dexter doing good or bad?&#34; I guess that should be left to everyone else's judgement.  Personally, I think it is a great film. I've enjoyed the previous 5 season, and this season as well.
B00APUQJLO|5.0|Due to lot of bad reviews, I avoided renting this movie for a few weeks, despite having wanted to see it since it was selected for the Cannes Film Fest in 2012.<br />I had read Don Delillo's book, so I knew what the main plot was about and expected the overly poetic flow of the dialogue.<br />I found it to be a great, entertaining movie that offers something different outside of the typical mindless Hollywood blockbusters. I was impressed by Pattinson and thought he carried the movie well, his choice to work with Cronenberg proves he's taking his post-Twilight career seriously.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|It wasn't as good as I'd  hoped it would be, but it was well done. Judy Dench is always fabulous.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|Great for messing around as a beginner. If youre serious about learning to play, I would recommend purchasing a real key board. I own a Yamaha psr E413 that is magnificent but have yet to learn on it much to my husbands dismay whom purchased it for me four Christmas' ago. This app however, has helped get me back on the right path of wanting to learn again and has been extremely helpful. Also, at how inexpensive the full version is, I recommend going with it so that you have access to some of history's greatest masterpieces. 5 stars! LOVE IT!!
B0086DBE62|3.0|The costuming was better than the movie, and I probably enjoyed the Bollywood-inspired number in the credits more than the rest of it.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I alway love the snappy and humorous dialog of these books.  It takes the edge off the subject matter somewhat.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I love 80s hairbands, so this was a lot of fun. The acting was uneven, but the music made up for it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Other than the 3 freezes we experienced with the streaming, great movie. *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I have to use an older version of the player that Amazon's using and for other movies, it's worked well. For this one, not so much. Still, the movie was fun. For me, the gag running throughout the movie didn't work, but overall it wasn't bad.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great read for mythology lovers and almost anyone who appreciates a good read every once and a wile will not disappoint Percy Jackson fans.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I thought, &#34;Okay! another fantasy story.&#34;  I couldn't put it down.  It took such a novel twist on magic and mind reading that I just had to keep reading to find out how it turned out.  Obviously I enjoyed it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a great way to pass time but also very addicting. I never play these types of games but I really enjoy this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found the bible very easy to use. And very easy to read and to keep up with my pasters in church.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|FROM  start to finish a solid read filled with facts and detail. This book is bigger than Bin Laden and gives credit where credit is due.
B0010ZR160|5.0|I was expecting a good movie, but instead got to see a great movie!! Incredible acting combined with a great storyline. I'm surprised not everyone got an Oscar- especially Tim Robbins! It's a sad movie, but so damn well done- it's worth watching!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|This music is Awesome!!!! I haven't heard this kind of music on one cd in years. Lindsey is one of a kind. Please put out more CDs Lindsey!!!
B000H4QD1O|5.0|My review is to curious people looking for something new; something fresh. I stumbled across this gem years after it had come and gone, having heard of it and not paying it much attention. Eventually in spite of its quirkiness (a space western, what?) I said, \\"hey what the hell I've got nothing else to do.\\" What I found was all of my childhood fantasies of being a(n): cowboy, astronaut, soldier, and do-good desperado rolled into one. All the while told in a fashion that feels just right, organic even. Firefly's universe is full of danger, desperation and no doubt adventure. It is just plain fun. Without a doubt the worst aspect of this series is that Firefly is but one season and a movie in length. The trip will be brief but it is a journey worth every step. Give it a try, you won't regret it.
B008Z9L94O|1.0|The sound was distorted and several tracks skipped. The artwork was, however, very cool. I was very disappointed to have to return this, but the sound was terrible.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this obsessive game but after awile it gets kind of boring but over all and most of the time it is extremely fun!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it!!! It has me addicted. Now on to the second book. Can't wait to see what they have in-store next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it for xbox360 my gammer tag is killainstink007 I don't no how to download it on Pc on my lap top for free
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|As everyone knows, google is a great search engine and it was a free service that I downloaded to my ipad.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book! I have been waiting to buy this book!<br />I will for sure read it again .
0446554995|5.0|If you have ever read one of their books, you know how great it is.  If you haven't, I would highly encourage you to get their first book and start from the beginning.  Excellent mystery book
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Well I wanted to know how to spell chapter<br />I found out how<br />But I don't care any more da
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|What a incredible set.  I will not repeat what many of the more knowledgable reviewers have already written.  I will say that the quality of the recordings is quite incredible.  From the earliest to the later, all were very listenable and rewarding.  Now.....the size of this set is UNREAL!  I started to upload them to iTunes but the file was so massive I gave up.<br /><br />Anyway, buy it!  You won't regret it!
B004QX07G4|4.0|This book was cute and funny. It lingered at parts but overall it was good.<br />I need 5 more  words...
B009HELT3C|2.0|Typical boring Hollywood shoot 'em up.  One dimensional characters with big guns.  Each scene is a repeat of the previous.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It kept me reading all the time.  I needed to find out how it was going to all fall together..
1449433251|5.0|Bought this for my 32 yr old son who grew up with C & H.  He loves.  Has spent hours reading and chuckling!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was awesome, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in action,and mystery. I can't wait to read the next book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I think that the way the book ended the trilogy was just perfect, let's start with that and then make our way back.<br /><br />I was so taken by the Hunger Games 1 and 2 that I NEEDED to know how all was going to pan out! What was going to<br />happen to the characters and of course the matter of the war...<br /><br />The only problem was that, the deterioration that i started noticing in Katniss during the second book just got to an<br />unbearable point in this one! And at least for me it did not draw any sympathy but it just made me dislike her for<br />turning into what i considered to be a bratty teenager! I did understand the fact that could have been suffering and<br />realizing she was a lot less that what she herself got to believe in terms of the war, but we get to see a very selfish<br />girl in this book that still now, im not certain i like. But we do see that Katniss talents, or lack thereof just turned her<br />into a \\"model\\", a face as the rebels themselves called her, and i think the realization of being nothing more than a<br />trademark is what gets to her from the beginning of the book.<br /><br />But these books were of so much more than just her... And it became so clear in this final volume. It was about how<br />power always comes with a methodic, almost shallow appreciation of humans, shown not only by Snow (who i think was<br />one of the few honest characters in the book, but we'll get to that later) but in Coin herself! My point with Snow is that<br />he was one of the few in the book who really knew WHO HE WAS and did not play any games to hide it, of course, he<br />made his final point in that amazingly written final conversation he had with Katniss.<br /><br />I think this book has a slow start, much like the second book and then it picks up towards the half... I will say i was<br />APPALLED by the way this war, this important revolution for humans became noting more than a TV show, turning the<br />rebels into little \\"Capitolian freaks\\" and acted out a war with some import an faces that for others was just so real. I think<br />of the entire series that was the most disturbing for me!<br /><br />One of the good things i felt in the book was the fact that we got to see more sides and stories of the revolution and got<br />some wonderful moments (none which had to do with Katniss directly) like getting to know the real Finnick, which was a<br />very special thing for me, the depth this character took was lovely and we saw real love and happiness inside this mess<br />with him and Annie... That's of course, until he died, just like that, in one short sentence!!!!<br /><br />Peeta, Peeta, Peeta... The real stone in this book! I knew he had to have a sense of calm and happiness when all of this ended,<br />because frankly, it he hadn't then i think i would have hated the book! He represents all the things that world needed, the<br />love, the kindness, the strong hold of one's own morals, the selflessness! I think it doesn't matter Katniss just settled for him,<br />(because sadly, that's what i felt happened), he deserved so much to have the girl he fell for and the family that i was genuinely<br />moved when i read the Epilogue, knowing at least he got what he longed for. On the Epilogue itself i will only say i understood<br />Katniss not sounding so crazy happy, after living all the things she lived and losing and being abandoned by so many she loved,<br />she could never be the same. Needless to say he's my favorite character in the trilogy and my eternal pick for Katniss!!<br /><br />I think, if you have come this far with books 1 and 2, you will, like me, need the closure, and despite what seems like a lot of<br />reasons why i hated the book i cant say i regret reading it, yes, hoped for some things to be different, but overall it did a great<br />job a setting the record straight about the fact that it not just the story of a girl and her problems but of many more things that<br />mattereda whole lot more.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The first chapters start out slow but after that I couldn't put it down!!! Well written with many hidden secrets! :)
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Soooo time consuming.  When I do have the time, I'll investigate further.  I'm getting feedback from friends though.  I have it on my PC too.
B000ID37RM|5.0|This book remains a classic. It was poignant at the time and remains relevant today. Shouldn't stay only in the classroom.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Our pre-teen girls loved it and surprisingly mom and dad loved it too. We all agree it was highly entertaining.
B00917IQFY|4.0|The most welcome return of the year for me. Graham Parker has always made terrific records, but this reunion with his old backing band The Rumour is really special. It's a great collection of songs made just that much better by the band.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Until I saw the movie, I never thought I would enjoy this series.  But, after the movie, I found I wanted to read the other two books and I'm glad I did!!  They were excellent!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|l have three houses the game is fun and the update are not the good but mind craft is awesome
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The unbreakable phone case comes with a crack!!! Disappointed, must return phone case to get another and hope it is not cracked
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My son and I really liked this movie which we saw on the big screen. We just had to have it in our collection. We don't buy many DVDs any longer as we use Netflix or Amazon Prime streaming so much. But sometimes along comes a movie we just have to have and Marvel's The Avengers was one of them.<br /><br />It is fun to see six super characters working together. What fun.

B009S8PEHY|5.0|I made a Christmas &#34;Smilebox&#34; using one of the cuts. Everyone recognizes his unique voice. I love the classic Christmas songs.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My husband saw this movie on pay tv and couldn't stop talking about it. So i bought it for him for Christmas. He LOVED his gift! It 's a great story about being a father and the trials of real life and the need for Divine Guidance. We laughed and cried during this movie. I loved it TOO!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this because can easily see the weather where all my peeps are.  I like the radar as well.  Thanks very much.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This was a fun movie. The plot was pretty far out there, and the writing could have been better, but it entertains. I had heard about this movie, and wanted to spend some gift certificate money on it, but found that the Blu Ray version was sold out in the brick and mortar stores I looked in at after Christmas. I ordered it off of Amazon, and it took a little longer than normal to get - wonder if it's more popular than Universal expected on home video? Anyway, quite a fun movie, good special effects, and I love the battle sequences. There are a lot of bad reviews of this movie out there, but most of them that I've read just miss the point of this movie. It's not Hamlet. Duh, what a surprise. It's an action sci-fi movie in the same vein as \\"Independence Day\\", with a similar quality of script and acting, and better special effects. It brings the board game into one of the sequences in a clever way, but it's not based on the board game. If you love old Battleships (like the Mighty Mo), you are going to get a big kick out of this movie. \\"Let's give em some lead!\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has action family love and romance all in one! Every time I read it it gets better! Seriously one of my favorites and as always hands down better than the movie!
0345803485|1.0|Seriously???<br /><br />I was a bit intrigued when these books hit the shelves, but never really wanted to read something like that, based on comments from people who already read them. And then one day, a friend of mine literally shoved the book in my hands and told me to read it. I thought, oh well, I surely wouldn't spend my money on this, but since I have it now, I'd give it a try... What a mistake!!!!<br /><br />I don't mind erotica in a story, but if it is page in and page our sex without any sense it is getting boring. I've managed to read half of the first book, but no more. From the page 1 Anastasia drools over Christian. There is no twist in a story, it is not captivating at all, no element of surprise. There is no story, period! Just sex from bad to worse.<br /><br />Everything in a story has to be well balanced. The one thing and one thing only I can give to this author, is that she wrote the story in a present tense. It is a really big challenge to write like that, although, my personal opinion, such a writing is not an easy reading, but it is an art to write in present tense. And that is as far as it goes.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed, and I can't even imagine what the movie will look like, and I really hope if they make a movie they will not break it into trilogy too.<br /><br />Don't waste your time. If you are after raw sex, get yourself some porn movie, will save you some time. But if you are looking for some real nice reading, which can captivate you from the first page to the last one, go look somewhere else.<br /><br />IMHO
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My IT guy from work recommended this book.  All I can say is WOW!  My girlfriend hates sci-fi but she started reading this the same time I did on our Kindles and we could not put it down.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|My son is a 3rd grader w/ a 4th grade reading level. He absolutely loved this book. Greg was his favorite & at one point this book made him laugh out loud.  This also allowed for excellent dinner conversation.

B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG I loved this  book! It had all the emotion and drama that a second book should have and leaves you on a cliff hanger that's almost unbelievable when you've read the first and second book and seen the movie! I hope that you guys enjoy it cause I definitely did. BOOK THREE HERE I COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this book because of the details on these two's romance. It made me think that I was telling the story and picturing all of the events.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It is all about chances, fun, turmoil, and love when you least expect it with just enough sexual tension to make it an excellent quick read.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It was a great deal. It cost me $30. Best buy had them on sale for $69.99 and they were on lifeproof a website for $80. It came in a lifeproof box but didn't fit the iPhone 4S and after numerous attempts and loss of sound because the cases wasn't lined up properly, it had to be returned. Maybe it's not the actual lifeproof case but a fake replica?
B0087HT36U|5.0|great game. lots of levels. hard but not impossible. wish more games were like this game. got it for free. yeah.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was absolutely brilliant. It's troubling to get into though and quiet confusing. Other than that, I say it's as good as the first one
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I finished this book in one day. Great twist of plot and good ending.  Excellent first novel.  I hope this author writes more.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Game is so addictive and fun I like the Dragon having process so simple the whole game is but it's amazing
B000IZA9PI|1.0|So bad that I cannot bother to spend the time writing a lengthy review about all that was hoaky and silly about this movie.  The rubber masks, the pathetic boring banter between the principle characters, and the cliche all black dark of the evil Romulans ... all of whom are horrible ugly monsters ... except the star of this movie who is a clone of Jean-Luc Picard, and coincidentally head of the Romulan Empire.  Oh the silliness abounds, not to mention the search for Data's \\"brother\\" who is a decoy Manchurian Candidate so to speak.  I have a hard time even trying to think of an episode of any of the Star Trek television shows that comes close to being as bad as this movie.  1/10 ... should be lower.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An absolute joy  to read.....even with tears falling down your face.<br />You'll laugh and cry and remember to be thankful for each day
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is unlike any other. It's marvelous and I like the fact you can to to the wilderness! Please get this game you won't be disappointed! :)
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I give this book on a scale from 1-5 a 3because I thought it had a little too much details and maybe it  was hard for me too understand. I would recommend this book too somebody who likes to read and like  to see a lot of words on a page. Honestly I would not like too read a book that has more words than this book  does. So that's what I think about this book on a scale  and as far as recommendation. I truly believe that the person that made this book spent a lot of time on it. I know it had to be frustrating. I know the person that made it spent a lot of money.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Awesomely cool and does not messing up and not a problem with it on my kindle fire or any thing

0393343405|5.0|Definitely gives the reader a different perspective on how we're got &#34;here&#34;. Highly readable and engaging, with a wonderful mix of storytelling and history.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game.Yes at the beginning it takes a bit of patience with the coins you have. However I am now level 184 and have over 7000 coins. It has been quite some time since I actually ran out of coins. Once you learn how to keep the special coins in the center, until they sometime give you credit off of the side, it gets really easy. Only thing is, I wish more of the Whistle prizes would spawn faster. I have max on all but them and the Fish, but Whistles get you the special coins that fall off the side. LOL

B00179ETVO|5.0|I first heard this CD in a small store in Sandpoint, Idaho.  When I asked who it was, I was told (Carla Bruni) and also told it was never released in the US so was not available to purchase.  Found it on Amazon for a great price even shipped from Europe!  It is my favorite of hers - buy it - you will not be disappointed.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME ITS SO FUNNY!!!!!! I LOVD IT! !! IF YOU LOVE RANDOM THINGS GET THIS APP IF U LIKE PUZZLES GET THIS IT LOOKS LIKE JELLO! !!!  ; )
B000068MKZ|5.0|Bought my first copy from Amazon, and somehow it became scratched beyond repair so ordered another one - it is my favorite of Carla Bruni and was never released in the US - both of my copies came from out of the country but arrived fast and were very reasonably priced.

B000JIHP88|4.0|While this fails to put my son to sleep, that doesn't mean he doesn't freaking love it. He likes to watch it move and \\"talk\\" to it. It's not overly stimulating though. He is very relaxed he just doesn't sleep. He loves for us to change his diaper in the crib so he can watch it go.<br /><br />The mobile came with a slight defect on the \\"arm\\". This in no way hindered the functionality of the mobile. It appears as though there was a rough part on the metal and the paint didn't go on smoothly because of it. Posted a picture.<br /><br />[...]
0765325950|5.0|This is truly an epic conclusion to one of the great works of this genre. Brandon Sanderson did an outstanding job of bringing this series across the finish line. I'm not sure what anyone who is critical of these last three books could have expected.  Other famous works, most notably the Dune series, have had their brilliant authors pass prior to completion and left readers wondering what could have been. This time we got to see the plot lines tightened up, some of the annoyances we all lived with corrected and a conclusion to a wonderful series we thought we might never have.<br /><br />Thank you Brandon.  May you always find water and shade.
B008K3N68M|5.0|Excellent movie about the Borgias. Jeremy Irons and the son that plays the Cardinal are excellent actors and add to the drama.

B0093FNZT6|4.0|Proof of Heaven was enlightening.  As a Christian it backed up my beliefs.  At times the technical jargon weighed it down but once you get past that it is great.  The fact that the writer is a Neurosurgeon gives it all more credibility and I feel Christians and non-Christians will be impressed.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Only Wes Anderson could weave together such a seamless tapestry of wonder, imagination and creative twists and turns. The narrative is illustrated masterfully with myriad compelling visual and psychological elements. I kept flashing back to Fantastic Mr. Fox as the story unfolded (another Wes Anderson favorite). The cast and direction were flawless. A true creative masterpiece!

B005LCYR7Y|4.0|if i recall correctly, this is the first Stephen King book I read since my teenage days (i'm 33 now), and it was my first book ever on kindle. fast paced and well told, it still seemed a story which was longer than it had to be, and to my feeling - TOO LONG. all in all, i enjoyed it, but i'm not sure it really left that special something that other books leave sometimes. not much lingered. i'm pretty sure this one will make it into a movie screenplay one day (hopefully not a 3 hour saga, but most go that way now). i guess King fans that are already used to these sort of lengths will enjoy it.

B000I0QL82|5.0|I love this movie and the special features really add.  The music of course is beautiful as are Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire's performances.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This trilogy was a little dull, truthfully. I had read that it wasn't well written and it wasn't. I had heard it was graphic, and it was. It just is not an extraordinary trilogy in any way. I didn't even feel it was all that controversial after reading it and it certainly wasn't shocking. Apparently no one remembers Anne Roquelaure's Black Beauty Trilogy.
B004RLEBTY|5.0|It doesn't matter what I say. It's a great album and that's my opinion. Get it and make your own opinion

B0041D843M|5.0|This book has been quite the eye opener for me. A ton of information within the first few chapters that are enlightening. If you are wanting that extra push to go to a plant based/ whole food diet, this book is a must for you!!

0451627768|4.0|Even if one doesn't accept the concept and theory one should read this.  It is an easier read than you might think, and the abridged version that this book doesn't take long to get through.  It will leave one with a great understanding of what has been the most argued theory of the last century, and which continues to be argued even today.
B004SIP9RO|4.0|Not entirely a Christmas movie but definitely on my calendar each year for Christmas viewing. Gentle, suspenseful, romantic and fun. Two very attractive actors in a charming story about, well, serendipity. I love it.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|It's good old fashioned rock and roll.  Good instrumentals and vocals you can sing along with.  Gave it as a gift.
B000RJW1Y2|3.0|I bought this racing wheel at Fry's for $35. That was cheaper than any wheel I'd seen that had pedals and, overall, it's definitely $35 worth. Let's look at the things I like. First it is a wheel and if you're used to driving with a game controller, this will be a big step up. It does work and it's fun to drive with it. It is a bit cheaply made, but one can't expect much more. It does, however, have a decent mounting clamp and, for me, it stays put pretty well. You just need to remember that it's a big plastic controller, not playground equipment. The pedals definitely do want to wander around on carpet but once you figure out how to immobilize them, they work fine and, for me, were key to driving well.<br /><br />Now for the things I don't like. It has limited turning range; the bottom of the wheel can go from 2 o'clock to 10 o'clock. But that's probably not much worse than what an F1 car requires in most races.<br /><br />There is a \\"sensitivity\\" setting about which the instruction page says, \\"On most games, for optimum reactivity of the wheel, we recommend to switch your wheel to 'High Sensibility' Mode.\\" My question is, if this is recommended for _most_ games, why is it not the default? I certainly have to deal with it every time for the games I play (GT5, Burnout Paradise, LBP Karting).<br /><br />The button mapping in general is somewhat annoying. Of all the games that a driving wheel should probably be able to handle right out of the box, GT5 seems like an important one. But, no, I had to go configure things. An important tip with GT5 is that if you go to the options menu and then choose racing wheel configuration, that will not work. In GT5, you have to treat this racing wheel as an ordinary controller. This means that you need to know which buttons are which. For example, the paddles are the L1 and R1 which I found counter intuitive and misconfigured; I ended up labeling them with a Sharpie.<br /><br />It turns out that I probably should have left it the way it was because it turns out that using the paddles to shift (which I thought was how it was supposed to be - they're labeled \\"up\\" and \\"down\\") is not a good idea. The reason is that the paddles are very poorly designed. I think the workmanship is ok and they look nice, but the design is completely absurd. In less than 6 weeks both of the paddles broke. The first time I was driving and in a big turn while shifting and I turned the shift paddle out of my fingertips and it snapped back into position and its own momentum caused it to break right off. So tip one, don't snap these shift paddles. But the second one was trickier because suddenly it just stopped shifting. I disassembled everything and found the shift paddles to be only held onto the wheel by a tiny isthmus of plastic. The interesting thing wasn't that they broke, but that they lasted as long as they did.<br /><br />That sounds pretty terrible and it is not good, but after opening up the wheel, I disassembled the paddle's circuit board with its momentary switches. I then just ran it out of the left paddle's former hole. Now I can access these buttons. I don't use them for shifting, but at least I can get at them now. This is important since you must press both of them to get that sensitivity change I mentioned.<br /><br />Also of note is the fact that you can remap buttons with a pretty simple system. There is a \\"mapping\\" button and it seems good at first. You just press \\"mapping\\" then a button as it is now and then the button you'd like it to be. Sounds good, but the problem is that if you want to swap two buttons, you need a temporary button (like a sorting routine) to hold one while you clobber it with the other. This means that you'll need to sacrifice a button's functionality.<br /><br />This isn't too big of a deal with most games. There's not that much going on. It's a cheap wheel and you can drive with it. But if you want wipers and horn and lights in GT5, it can be tricky. Speaking of the horn, there's a nice big Ferrari horn button on the wheel, but it is fake. No horn functionality.<br /><br />One last thing to note is that when I took the thing apart, I found that there was a motor in the wheel itself; it would be in your palm as you held the wheel. The motor had an eccentric weight and is clearly designed for vibration. I have used normal controllers and GT5 definitely can make them vibrate when you go off the track, but I've never had any such feedback from this wheel. It's like the motor or circuit board is bad. Maybe some enterprising person would like to pull one apart and investigate further. This wheel would certainly be a great starting point for someone wanting to build their own racing wheel but who lacked the electronics.<br /><br />Over all I like this wheel and I liked that it got me into driving sims for only $35. But I can't give it more than 3 stars. It's a 3 star price and that's what you get. But if you treat it well, it can be a lot of fun. I think it will make a good second wheel for casual 2 player racing when I upgrade.e's a nice big Ferrari horn button on the wheel, but it is fake.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has been one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  I was left speechless and emotional after reading this.  The things that Sky and Holder go through would bring most characters to their knees and have them give up.  You'll fall in love with Holder over and over and your heart will break over and over again for Sky but in the end the emotional journey you go through with these two characters is well worth it!

B008XCJ03K|5.0|I picked up this album after sampling all the tracks and it sounded like something I was in the mood for- also, the album was on sale.  Woah, I was taken aback by the gentle and honest lyrics, but the melodic songs.  There is a fine line in Passenger's album that is both hard and soft, and I enjoyed every song.  The other thing I like is that there are 5 acoustic versions of songs on the album at the end, which is something I haven't seen an artist do: basically give me free acoustic version of the album's music.  Great stuff.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I use these for working out. I've put numerous \\"active\\" headphones through the gauntlet of my exercise regimen and now it's time to reflect on the MDR-W08L.<br /><br />- They fit rather comfortably and are extremely light. Rest assured, they won't weigh you down.<br /><br />- The sound is average, but the volume is more than you need for most applications.<br /><br />- The cord is a little short. Not an issue for me, but it may cause you some hiccups.<br /><br />Bottom line: For the price, I'm not sure you can find a better pair of headphones, particularly if you're an avid athlete. I've gone through countless \\"active\\" headphones from $15 to $75 that were unusable after only a few months of regular use. With the MDR-W08L, I have a reliable, bargain-priced, no-frills headphone. It gets the job done and I don't have to worry if I lose them. I'll just buy another pair.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing, mesmerizing, intelligent television.  With classic scenery and stunning clothing.  The acting is super too. Enchanting look at an upstairs/downstairs situation.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Story was weak, the movie flowed poorly. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but was sorry it wasn't free, that's all it was worth.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I'm a big fan of action movies and &#34;Battleship&#34; is a great selection for my collection. Being able to watch it on my Blu-Ray player and regular dvd player is a plus.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Entertaining sci-fi story for what it is. Sub-par acting (almost laughable at times). Special effects were awesome! (I think this is where most of the budget went ;)<br /><br />My wife and I were killing an afternoon at home and this is what we chose - it was o.k.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Love this 3d movie. Great story line and 3d effects and great cast. Alternate endings make it very interesting. I highly recommend this movie.
B0051OZ564|3.0|I'm not going to lie to you:  Sucker Punch won't rate as an &#34;all time great&#34; movie like &#34;Casablanca&#34;, or &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;.  It also helps if you are a male that likes women who show a lot of &#34;skin&#34; and kick a lot of b**t.<br /><br />But seriously, this movie ranks (at least for me) as a guilty pleasure, I saw it in previews and thought:  OK........it's worth a look see to watch with a bunch of guys who like looking at pretty girls.  And that's what the movie (on the surface) wants you to buy into.<br /><br />Pretty girls who dance and show skin and seduce their clientele while secretly.....trying to escape the near prison like circumstances they live in.  The movie itself has a comic book/surrealistic (pillow) aspect to it<br /><br />A very seductive soundtrack adds a lot to the movie itself and I think enhances every scene.  But overall, this is a fantasy movie for guys (teenage and up).<br /><br />Remember as a youth, how much you enjoyed going for a ride at an amusement park that now as an adult, that ride doesn't seem all that great?  Sucker punch is like that: not that great at first...........but if you just go with it and not try to look for it's flaws..........can still provide thrills.  Just don't take it too seriously...........................
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book even more than I thought that I would! I love the hunger games and I can't wait to read the sequel!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Don't take it too seriously and it becomes a really enjoyable movie. The plot twists are great and the ending is delightfully different.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We loved this in the movies, so I wanted it for my grandson, since we saw it without him! He enjoyed it as well! Especially great for young girls!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true patriot!  This book truly reaches the sole while serving to inspire the reader to learn more of the conflict in Iraq, as well as the men who have served.  Kyle does not romanticize war and is not afraid to give the reader facts. He is truly humble and honest - qualities to expect in a man.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Good quality recording and materials. Well formatted. All BBT fans should like this product. Just wish it was a bit less expensive.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|As the title suggests, this app is a great way to keep alarms and time and such.  However, the alarm is startling and annoying, as it is too loud in my house and wakes everyone inside.  On a positive note, the app is very user friendly.  It has abilities to wake with passcodes, draw patterns, and even to solve an arithmetic problem.  Every function is programmable in some way.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is simple and just what I needed for my Kindle.  I like that it clips the tablet in without having to slip it into a sleeve or plastic cover.  The flip-back feature works great and I like that I can plug in to my tablet while the case is either open or closed.  So far, a great product and worthy of the price.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was extremely fortunate to have read the books before I saw the movie, as I did not feel the movie did the first book justice.  So much attention to detail, wrapped around the violence of the games, with a lovers story that challenged society and the government before them.  An instant classic and one I will continue to recommend.
B007SGM084|1.0|I have only started reading the first book, but I can't seem to relate to the main character. And, it is not because I am 40. I love the Twilight series. The story seems redundant.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|A terrific display of violence, betrayal, and a sense of honor that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  A great blending of comic book and motion picture, the details and story line pick up flawlessly.  The graphics and sounds of the movie are great, you will be turning and flinching at every insect sound and quick camera shot.  By far, the best Predator movie I have seen yet since the days of Danny Glover fighting for his survival in war torn Los Angeles with me in my P.J.'s munching down some Lucky Charms.  This will be a favorite of my collection for a very long time.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Title says it all. I am a fan of zombie movies, but this series doesn't cut it anymore. Pass on this one.
B005PR44XC|4.0|Typical Lewis -- easy to read but packs a good dose of unwelcome but necessary-to-know data.  Read it and then go out and insult a banker!
B001P06GX4|4.0|This game wasn't quite what I expected, but fun nevertheless. Just so you know, there are only four players. I wasn't aware of that when I purchased it, so if that's a factor for you, maybe you don't want this- I'm glad I bought it despite the limited number of players.<br /><br />This game makes you think. Somewhat like Tetris, you have pieces of different shapes that you have to fit on a board. The object is to get all your pieces on first, but the tricky part is the fact that in order to put a piece down, it has to touch the corner of one of your other pieces- and only corners can touch. Each time you play the game it's different because no one puts down the pieces in exactly the same order every time. I have four small children ages 9-4. They can all play. It's a great game to have, but I didn't think it was as fabulous as everyone else did. One of the great things about this game though, is it only lasts about a half an hour. Sometimes that's all we can handle at our house:). Would I recommend it? Definitely.
B0076794IO|4.0|Reading this, I wished I was reading it in paper book format rather than Kindle.  Because it's highly crafted in terms of the timing of events in the story (or perhaps just cavalier?), I had to GoTo several times to keep the continuity straight in my head.  Other than that, a racy good read.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I couldn't handle the download myself, I had to recruit my son.  My bank account had been charged, and I got my confirmation email, but I couldn't find the dang product.  It was infuriating.  I fought with my tablet for three hours and finally gave it over to my son.  Once I finally got it in place, it is satisfactory, no more than that.  I can view and create documents, but it is VERY rudimentary.  Almost like Word Pad, for those who are familiar with Word Pad.  It's plain text, no real formatting options.  It will be fine for what I want, which is my personal writing, but in the end I will have to download it to a thumb drive or memory card, and load it on a real computer to finish.
B0089MMU54|5.0|This has to be at least the twentieth time I have read these books. Having had to read Mansfield Park first (most unwillingly) as a school requirement I then took on Pride and Prejudice and was hooked.  No matter how often I read them, there's always something new.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a well written, complex story that has all the familiarity of a Jack Ryan novel but with the advantage of having two Jack Ryans in it.<br /><br />There is a very clear transfer of responsibilities where the son (Junior) takes over the crazy jobs that marked the beginning of his father's career in intelligence and comes fully into his own as a character. While the father (Jack Ryan Sr.) shows signs of age as is appropriate for fifty something person.<br /><br />If you are a Jack Ryan fan, this is a must read. If you haven't read any of the Jack Ryan books but like political thrillers, this would be still be a great read :)
B00A77II0U|4.0|but a little laggy in playing.  But not enough to interfere with the enjoyment of the game.  I really liked the storyline, fun and scary, kind of sad ending though.  Now I'm off to find another Alawar game!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|The casting was superlative and the acting first-rate. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but it did not live up to my expectation.
B005KELW26|5.0|It met my expectations - was a gift for my granddaughter.  She liked it.  I would recommend the product to anyone who owns a Kindle Fire.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this morning i would have given iit 5 stars. got home from work and my entire game is gone. back to level 1. was 81. guess im done with this game
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like the book. It's useful,of course because it's a dictionary,duuhh? I also saw another dictionary in my book category on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who loves James!  If you love James, you will love his christmas CD. Look at his pictures on FB!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book can't wait till February when the movie comes put! Nicholas Sparks is my favorite writer and I love all of his book.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|My son loved it. He loves lego products, and this is similar but now he doesn't have to create his own halo items.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You cant put this book down. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is everything that the reviews said. It isworthreading .
B000FCK65W|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is all about achieving the American dream through determination, imagination, and education.  Life for the Nolans was very harsh in the sense that they didn't have much in the sense of money.  The father, an alcoholic who at best brought occasional income was a charming lad who was very well loved by his family, up until the bitter end, when he died, leaving a posthumous child.  The mother is a strong woman, steady, responsible, and caring.  The heroine in this book, however, is Francie Nolan, who loves to write.  In the end, she doesn't become a published writer,  but she did keep her stories real, describing how life in poverty really is, and stands for herself when an ignorant teacher tells her that her writings are sad and ugly.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book isn't as great as the other ones in the series. It wasn't all that interesting and it didn't even bring back little scenes or remembrances from the older books. Overall it was a good book ,but not the best in the series.
B0067TGSOK|3.0|If you're searching for how to start a business on a shoestring, this book will give you good ideas.  The gist is, that you can do what you love and still be successful, without a lot of overhead.  Find a problem that needs solving, solve it, and charge for it.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Amazing sound with reverb like an actual gong and lots of timing flexibility. This is one of my favorite apps.
B006TTC5QS|5.0|Great value and will bring enjoyment to those who watch it. Great gift idea to give to your significant other.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's a great book, written completely in letters to an anonymous \\"friend\\". It's a little sad but the book really makes you feel infinite.
0979019710|5.0|Finally, this book showed me the point in my life that I have been unable to get past before.  Highly recommended.
1416905014|5.0|WE have a pop up book collection and this makes a wonderful addition as the pop ups are as good as all the other wonderful quality books we own.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is about Greg and how his first day of middle school is and Roddick tells him tips he will need for middle school. Is Greg going to survive middle school read the book and find out.ps read the book then watch the first movie. Cristina
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is simply incredible. I have used many devices to remote into my desktop in my day and, without a doubt, Splashtop offers the most bang for your buck. I use it just about everyday on my Kindle FireHD. Do not even hesitate on this product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is played several times on many different areas. AARP, computer games, and now Kindle Fire HD.  I think this is a lot of fun.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The amazing incident where the lives of an American and a German pilot intersected forms only a short part of the story but serves as its focus.  Very well-written.  Provides incredible insights into the lives and thoughts of one of Germany's best fighter pilots and many of his colleagues.  Comparable to &#34;The Forgotten Soldier&#34; in scope.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Real kick but with a lot of action, on a 7.1 Souround System nothing but a great experience. Great Si-Fi .
B003UESJF6|5.0|My four-year-old granddaughter loves this movie.  She is totally absorbed while watching it, and it has a great message, too, i.e., we choose to be the type of person we want to be.
1451629184|5.0|Excellent book, not for young readers which I assume you would imagine why.  A must read for any child advocate.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Just another fabulous album by Mark Knopfler.  Although the title song isn't my favorite, it is Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This is an amazing soundtrack.  It is both beautiful and moving and we finally get to hear a definitive dwarven theme.  Howard Shore has really made yet another fantastic score for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and I look to the followup music for the next two movies.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Obviously I am a Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler fan, I can not be objective on any review.  I think everything they do is fabulous.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is a fun set fairly well built! Shipped fast and was a great christmas gift! Also 25 dollars cheaper than any local retailer
B009NPA3Q4|2.0|I think he's a really talented singer/songwriter, but the cd has very little on it that doesn't sound like Dave Matthews.  I wonder if the people here who are giving rave reviews have ever heard Dave Matthews?
B00004YRQA|5.0|Bought this and it came fast well packaged and worked great! What can i say its a memory card lol
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really can't put this review into words. I am hopelessly speechless.<br /><br />The love and the passion between Holder and Skye explode on every page even in the face of unthinkable despair and spiraling danger. This book really made me think about the realities of life and how two young teenagers who literally have been through hell from a very young age fall so much in love that it gave them strength to live.<br /><br />(This quote is not related to the book but it so reminded me of Holder and Skye)<br /><br />\\"Love comes to those who still hope even though they've been disappointed, to those who still believe even though they've been betrayed, to those who still love even though they've been hurt before.\\"<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? Oh- yes.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is brilliant.
B007SGM084|5.0|Undeniably the most desirable love story you would ever want to read.  I kept reading past my bedtime!  Intoxicating, addicting!
B008476HBM|5.0|One of my favorite stories.  Love the old movie about it.  Sort of a different take on the story of Cinderella or the rags to riches theme.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the funnest game in the whole world (if you ever get a game called block story use the world seed m awesome.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the few television programs that my wife and I can agree on.  We've been watching since the first season and there hasn't been a bad episode yet.  Although set nearly 100 years ago, it somehow feels more &#34;real&#34; than almost any &#34;reality&#34; show that's now filling the airwaves.  Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome way better than temple run cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool Cool cool cool cool
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Intriguing and fascinating story, but difficult for a lay person to understand the scientific terminology used to explain physiological events happening in the brain. I would still recommend the book to anyone who doubts or questions the possibility of eternal life.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this app!!!!! I now cant fall asleep because Im constantly on the game distroying humanity mwhahaahaha!!!!! I will distroy you all!!!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I read the reviews of this book and found it to be more than I expected.  Deborah Harkness developed the storyline and characters in a way that I willingly suspended my disbelief!  Totally captivating and I will look forward to reading the next book in the series.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Works great for action time lapse photography. Longer scenes require a power source. This case allows you to power the camera externally.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She said it was one of the best gift she got. She had been looking for the collector's edition. Plan to watch many times.
B009E3EY38|3.0|Sound quality is fair, not enough base and punch for a DTS quality. Picture is fine except for those inserted low resolution clips they throw here and then throughout the concert.
0375713751|5.0|This book had me hooked by the first 3 pages.  The character hits on many of my thoughts and concerns.  There were situations and places I would never go, but those situations added drama and left me guessing which way Kate, the main character, was going to go.  I recommended it to my female friends and I recommend it to you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The family dynamics in this novel really stay with you even weeks after finishing the book.  Brings to mind the question as to how far will a person go to protect/defend their child/children.  The ending was absolutely unexpected and still left the reader wondering guilty/not guilty.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|I never did get to download this game because it had alot of problems because the download was soo big even over the wi fi. Still don't have this game! That sucks.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My grandchildren love this toy, it is the most played with toy in the house. So many uses. I love it
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play this alot when im bored! It helps!!! Defenetly worth the space on ur device! I suggest it! (:
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me intrigued. Didn't want to put it down. Great book. Better than the first one. Can't wait to read the third one.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Both my boys who are limited to 2 hours of gaming per week, I even tried it and liked it since it ads a twist with determining trajectory due to gravitational pulls.
B007SGM084|5.0|good price for all three books, delivered right away to my kindle.  Easy to read, and enjoyed the books all together, versus having to have 3 separate books
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is an addicting. game n me n my family love it.  it is better than any other game I have downloaded so far
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Buying the whole album rather than a few songs off of it is definitely well worth it.  This entire album is awesome - Calvin Harris is a very talented DJ who can spin and make absolutely DIVINE tunes independently or in collaboration with other artists. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Another great performance by Matthew. Loved him as a lawyer in A Time to Kill and this film. He is perfect for this role and portrays the character well. Also an outstanding support cast and great story line.
B008XNPO20|2.0|Elephant is a good track, and there are few other decent ones, but the album is a bore to listen. Two first songs sets the scene for the rest of it and if you get bored listening them, don't buy the album.
007174889X|5.0|Arrived in pristine shape. Gold standard text for Med students and other Health professionals.I have read 3<br />former versions over the years.. Great 2 volume edition and color coded.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This has come in VERY handy! We use this on a daily basis for figuring our child's insulin. It's easy, and our children even enjoy using it.
B007EC27QM|4.0|This is not an overly complicated calculator.  I don't think you'll be using logarithms on this or doing calculus as it's just a four function calculator with a percent key thrown in, as well as memory.  It's a good size and easy to read, plus you can go to the actual calculation to insure you entered the numbers correctly.
0761169253|5.0|I bought this for my nephew who was graduating from high school.  A lot of books in this category are just recycled bull, but this one is really unique and entertaining!  A very special book, indeed...might get one for myself!
B009DH379C|5.0|I watched this concert many times, but seeing it in Blu ray is like watching a whole new concert, almost like Freddie was still with us.  Same tour as Live at Wembley DVD.  Everyone should have this in thier collection
B003O86FMW|4.0|Yes... I had to write a review so I did and the book was cool and everything so yeah :)
1402270275|4.0|I picked this book up at the library because of the steampunk aspects. It is set in a steampunk type universe- an alternate 19th century England which can't be called Victorian because the queen is named Alexandra- with advanced medicine and mechanical men, but the steampunk aspects are definitely background, not the main event. It's actually a paranormal romance between a human woman and a... well, not quite a vampire yet.<br /><br />In McMaster's world, the need to feed on blood is caused by a virus. The infected can live for many years with accelerated healing and enhanced speed and strength, but ultimately they succumb to `the fade', where they turn pale, lose their hair and also lose control of their minds. These demented monsters are what the people of this world call vampires. The upper class keeps tight control of the virus; they only allow members of the elite to become infected because of the advantages it provides for decades. The infected are known as `blue bloods' because of the color their blood becomes after infection- a little play on our own use of the term!<br /><br />Blade is a rogue blue blood who runs the Whitechapel district, the part of London that is home to thieves, prostitutes, murderers and fugitives from the law. Honoria is one of those fugitives, running from an evil duke who basically feels he *is* the law. In addition to keeping herself hidden, Honoria has to protect and feed her younger sister and brother- a brother with a secret of his own.<br /><br />What happens between Blade and Honoria is fairly predictable: they meet; they are both disagreeable even though they are irresistibly drawn to each other sexually. But they aren't childish about it, thankfully. They keep secrets from each other but not as badly as most romance characters. Their relationship makes progress throughout the book rather than waiting until the very end. And Honoria is honest with herself about how she feels, rather than going through 200 pages of denial.<br /><br />There is a lot of action and some unexpected events. The world building holds together. I enjoyed the book a lot, although I have to say that if I had read about what Honoria's nipples were doing one more time I might have screamed. I will read the next in the series if I see it at the library. There is a LOT of sex in the book, but it's pretty well done.><br />There is a lot of action and some unexpected events.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love this app. On all maps trees are everywhere . With that you can make a big house.I got it and I love it!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Bought this for a special little kid.  I saw this movie at a friend's house.  As a grown man and an admitted non-movie buff, when I saw this movie I knew my little friend (who's 5 yrs old) would love it.  Gave it to him as a Christmas present and he LOVES it.  Made me feel good to put a smile on the kid's face. Pretty good movie!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It made me cry for Prim . When her cat Buttercup walked back to 12 & they cry together for Prim. Great book.
0307593525|5.0|What can I say? This is THE cookbook set to have. Both books are excellent. The bindings and heavy cardboard case are beautiful, sturdy and very well done. The 2 volume set was an excellent value. Everyone has heard of these cookbooks. This set is a must have for cooks everywhere of all ages.
B0045HCIYA|5.0|the movie makes absolutely no statement on the human condition. demi moore can.t act. but i love viewing her semi nude in every type of seductive pose..
0300176147|5.0|This is an excellent book for adult as well as younger readers.  It is a world history SUMMARY in story form NOT an advanced textbook with endless dates and details (which most of us won't remember anyway).  It gives a very readable and interesting OVERVIEW of world history which is most appropriate for most of us non-history majors.  It was written in the early 1900s by a PhD professor of history for a children's story and I enjoy reading it and am reading it to my young granddaughters who are very interested and ask a lot of questions.  This book was a great publishing success and has been translated into many languages and is divided into short chapters (periods in history) which makes for very convenient reading.  The reader will learn a lot about world history and I would recommend this book for both adult and younger readers who are non-history majors and want an interesting, very readable overview of world history with adequate details.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The best part about this book is the &#34;teaser&#34; for when the same story is told by Christian Grey.  Unfortunately, you don't get to this part until after you have waded through the entire book.  The Story of O was more interesting porn because at least in that story, the gal turns the tables and &#34;brands&#34; her man with a cigarette in the shape of an O.  Here, we just plod through more S/M sex with hubby telling the little wife to &#34;come&#34; and &#34;sit&#34; and &#34;stay&#34;  oh wait!  Is this a dog training book after all?  Well, not to give it all away, but she ends up &#34;training&#34; the husband to act normal and to ditch his first partner.  Ho Hum.  It took me weeks and weeks to read this tome.  I really don't know why I did except just to prove to myself that I, too, had will power.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great story about the \\"true\\" life of our great warriors!!! So proud of all of our military forces!!! Thanks for your service to our Country!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While written for &#34;Young Adults,&#34; this book is good for those of us between 20 and 65.  It is a fast read, with important lessons for those who should learn to fear an increasing central/federal government and the ills that can convey.  Katniss, the protagonist, is believeable as a 16 year old.  But she is wise beyond her years, taking care of her mother and her younger sister alike.  She hunts--a skill that is dying in America today.  She has boy friends (not boyfriends), there is no sex but there is real love.  There is also an understanding that people must sometimes do things they do not want to do in order to be accepted--or taken to the extreme--survive.  She is not strong physically, but strong emotionally and with a quick mind she not only survives but thrives.  A great story, well told, of import and with some laughs and warnings of what could be our real future in America.  One drawback...don't start it on a week day --wait for a Friday night to start it because you can read late into the night.
B003VR5PPY|3.0|My husband loved this game so I picked it up for myself. While the puzzles were fun the story took too much time. In order to get a &#34;good&#34; ending you have to play through at least twice and the second time through I tapped the screen for thirty minutes trying to get through the talking bits. My husband said that was his favorite part though so it might be for you. Another drawback is the constant instructions every time you do something like open a safe. It would be better if i could choose whether to have them repeat every time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great follow on book full of surprises and lessons, warnings, of how a big centralized government is dangerous to its citizens. A much darker book now that more is revealed.  Katniss still a great hero, with gusto and love of life and loyalty to those in her inner circle. She learns to trust allies she didn't think she could, she learns to make more decisions and how to expand her extraordinary capabilities far beyond what a teenager would normally be able to do.  She is infectious.  She is talented.  She is believable. As with the first in the series, I couldn't put it down.  Thank God for Kindle, otherwise my reading light would have kept my poor husband awake all night for several nights.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Jane Austen is my most favorite author. It's always a treat to see her book come to life.  This is definitely the best one I've seen so far. I will highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Wow, some hot sex if you like that kind of sex.  For me, Vanilla is good enough.  I felt sorry for Anna who never experienced love or carnal knowledge except at the hands of someone who was raped as a teenager and then went to sex clubs to practice his brand of affection. Anna, the protagonist, is supposed to be pretty but she made it though college a virgin.  She is supposed to have a backbone and spunk, but she is constantly biting her lip and looking down at her knotted hands.  Anna is quick to see that Mrs. Robinson was wrong to do what she did to Christian Grey, but apparently not bright enough--though we are supposed to believe she is quite bright--to see that Christian is doing to her what Mrs. Robinson did to him.  The spiral continues.  What a shame.  If you have even seen \\"Real Sex\\" on HBO after midnight, you know that most of this kind of off the grid sexual activity is conducted by some really unattractive people....in this book you are to believe it is for the rich and beautiful, which is probably the thing that is the \\"hardest to swallow\\" of them all.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Good graphics and love the story line. Can't wait to finish the game! Mini. Games are lots of fun...<br />My daughter and I love playing it together.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Ho hum.  Nothing more here than in the first book, except more of it.  What can you say about a woman who is supposed to be brave and strong and capable who wears silver balls &#34;you know where&#34; for the first time ever to a formal affair at her boyfriend's parents' home? Talk about wanting to make a great first impression!  Never thought hot sex could be so dull.  Barbara Walters may find the author facinating, but apparently, Barbara has led a very unimaginative life.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Just started playing the game and I am  New at finding the items in the dark but it is fun, you might like it!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is wonderful. I don't like it as much as Cut the Rope, but I eagerly await the next version.
0553582038|2.0|Why in the world would you subject your readers to this?  You have a writing style that can even make borderline nothing mildly interesting (as proven in this book and book 5).  But trying to say that this is advancing the story is a joke.  The is the book equivalent of an every day soap opera NOT an epic saga.  Unless it is an epic saga dealing with who is having sex with who, arya as the Karate kid...I was waiting for Mr Miaggi to show up, and Sansa as the most clueless kid on the block.  Perhaps the most hilarious part of the &#34;saga's&#34; development was Brienne as the wandering Knight without a clue.  I was about 350 pages in when I realized the most interesting thing to happen was two prison guards getting killed.  Or maybe Pia the toothless laundry girl is going to save the realm?  Wait, I got it, Podrick Payne is going to rise up and slay...well who knows, slay something important.  If so it's sheer genius you circle back to flesh out those characters.  Why introduce more characters when you can't move the ones you have forward?  As near as I can tell the sum total of Jaime's development in this book is to practice his swordplay with his left hand (getting only marginally better) and for some bizarre reason continue his transition away from the selfish, honor less, and flamboyant person he was.  Hey I'm fine with characters developing and changing, but dont give me a guy who is willing to kill a child (sure Bran didnt die, but Jaime thought he would), lives for incest,  and consort with murders to suddenly start developing honor, and a conscious.  Or was all the bad in him contained in his right hand and once that was removed he was slowly cured of his wicked ways?  I guess the joke is on the reader again.  I love the part where you indicated book 5 will be out in a year since you've written so many of the chapters already.  One year, five years...same difference right?  At the day to day pace Martin is going at this should wrap up sometime in the 23rd century.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Inspirational for anyone with trauma and or addiction. Anthony is truly a great writer and artist making it difficult to put the book down. Exposed the true and hard required to heal. The music was great and this story makes the music even better. Added bonus, stop and listen to the songs that corelate to the point in time within the story. Thanks for sharing the struggles, without knwowing us, you are helping all of us who are reading, listening and feeling.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|I like most of the songs on the album, some I was neutral about. Overall, it's fun and gets your hips swaying.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I preordered this and it arrived as soon as the album was released. This is one of my fav albums of 2012
B0048IMZMG|5.0|Her songs are always so damn catchy! My friend's husband even listens to her! She writes her own songs based on her experiences which makes it relate-able. Her music is memorable and fetching. Have a listen.
B000M341QE|1.0|i found it or 2$ and i was so bored with this film  i tried to skip past  but this movie was way to slow
B003AJKPL2|4.0|This is pretty self-explanatory. Put the cherry in, press. Easy to use but it does splash. I had to use this over the sink so I wouldn't get cherry bits of splats on the counter.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I'm sure it speaks to someone, but I'm not hearing it as clearly as expected. I'll concede there were some funny lines and scenes.  At least I rented it when it was on sale.
0525478817|5.0|I laughed. I cried. I laughed again. I cried again.<br /><br />I finished it in one sitting. I already knew what was going to happen, it was inevitable. The things that happened in between were just sweet, comforting and unconditional love.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have always been a hard core &#34;PC&#34; person and they had to drag me kicking and fighting to purchase an iPad.  After I got the iPad, almost immediately, I said it was nothing but an expensive paperweight and/or toy.  I couldn't do anything that I was accustomed to do with a PC.  With my Android phone I can transfer files with a simple USB connection to my PC, I can print to my networked laser printer, and I can do almost everything that I can do on my PC.  With the iPad, I can't print unless I purchase an &#34;Air Printer&#34; and hey where is the USB cable connection for transfering files.... none!  Dropbox has finally made it to where not only can I access files from my PC but they don't take up valuable space on my iPad.  Great love it!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I actually like all the songs on the album; good lyrics and catchy beats. If I had to pick, my two favorite would be the Lazy Song and Marry You. Overall, a great album. Highly recommend.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Easy read, very interesting.  It's written in the form of letters from a young man to an unknown person.  The letters tell the story of this boy's freshman year in high school.  He has some issues and is working through them and in his letters he tells of all his adventures and problems.  Finally, in the end you learn why he is the way he is.  I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to others.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Deep within us all is the Gnosis that we're missing the mark on Human exsitance. Chapter One nails that feeling within!  Can't wait to see \\"The Solution\\" unravel.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great read!  Great story; King always keeps the story suspenseful.  Sometimes when I finish a Stephen King book I am let down by the ending because I've been on the edge of my seat the entire book.  This time he did a great job and I loved the ending!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good way to waste time.  Some strategy.  Kind of.  Great for all ages.  Young ones will love it.  Get this game.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I bought this for my little friends that visit - I found myself watching it as avidly as they do.  It is beautiful and such a wonderful story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was one of the best I've read lately. I love romance novels and this one really captivates you and brings you into the story. Definitely recommend reading this one. It would be pretty cool if they made it into a movie too!
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|I watched this with my 12 year old son and we both agreed it was disturbing.  The movie was about a 10 year old girl who was murdered by adult men who thought she was a witch...kid movie????
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is a decent app. lots of different genres that I like that are not in other apps out there. not very graphical but hey, it works. glad I got it as a free app of the day. I wouldn't pay $3.99 for this.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was a surprising easy read. This book captured me within the first chapter. I would've loved for there to be more books to read after this but unfortunately there wasn't, now I'm laying down wishing there was more. I've told all my friends about this book and how good it is.<br /><br />  Until next time.. hopefully I'll be reading more about Christian and Ana..SOON
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie has the most amazing special effects and I love the story behind it. The characters were cast to perfection and I'm so glad they have all been modernized for my children to enjoy.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I suppose it would be ok as your regular &#34;smashum - bashum - sci-fi summer movie,&#34; as long as you did not see the original. Even my 16 year old agreed ... He wanted to see Total Recall 2012, so we watched it (mainly while I played bubble-pop on my phone) because it was too annoying. Then we talked about the original and ended up watching it. He said he was glad he did not see it BEFORE the remake. That about says it all. I read that Schwarzenegger was highly aggravated that it was remade. After watching it, I have to agree.  Watch the old one. It holds up very well.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|I really enjoyed the first Expendables and was very excited to see that a second one was coming out. I was every bit as impressed with the second one as I had been with the first. Pick this one up.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This romantic book shows us all that love at first sight exists!! Awesome novel. It was definitely worth reading. Loved it.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I was kind of disappointed. When I saw that Total Recall was being re-made I was excited. I really enjoyed the original and I assumed with the impressive new graphics that it would be awesome. I'm pretty sure the only thing that was the same was the three boobed lady.
B005D0RDKW|4.0|A true Rush fan will appreciate this live performance more than the average fan.  I did not know a lot of the songs but still appreciated the fine playing by Getty, Neil and Alex.  Those guys are just plain amazing musicians.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|This is my favorite version of Alice in Wonderland yet! Of course, Johnny Depp plays such a great odd character so he was perfectly suited for the Mad Hatter role. I highly recommend it!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Interesting take on time travel.  Good acting, good storyline but predictable.  I recommend continually reminding yourself what year the movie is set in so you don't confuse it with 2013.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. does an amazing job of capturing the nuances of the quirky Sherlock Holmes character and he plays it to perfection. I truly enjoyed the fun story line and recommend this movie.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK, THIS SERIES AND THIS AUTHOR. She is my inspiration for my writing. I love her love her love her! I have re read this series over and over and over and over! If I could I would give it more than 5 stars rating!
B0064NTZJO|2.0|This is easily one of the worst and most disgusting movies that I have ever seen in my life. The story is boring and the violence over-the-top. If you're thinking about watching this one I recommend that you skip it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My generation would consider this pornography.  I didn't get far with it. I'm shocked that  modern reviewers would consider this art and worthy of good reviews.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Of all the comic book movies that have released recently Thor is the best. The special effects are absolutely amazing and the story line solid. You should see this one. I highly recommend it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I thought Where's My Water was awesome then I found this!! I love the use of the different states of water! Lots of clever levels...but not so hard as to be frustrating.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|It was okay but not great. I had some high expectations when this movie released but I was majorly disappointed. It was not horrible but not great either. If you like the comic movies and don't set your standards too high then you might enjoy it.
0061650994|5.0|At Christmas My 8 year old granddaughter opened the present with the  book in it first. We had a hard time getting her to<br />open any more presents, she liked the book so much. She reads and rereads the book.  I liked the book too.
B005LAIH54|4.0|I was concerned that the second one wouldn't live up to the first but it did. I really enjoy this type of movie so I always walk in to the theater with high expectations and I wasn't disappointed.
034580404X|5.0|The 'Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed' is the best series of books I have read in a long time. The story is great and EL's style of writing is refreshing. I look forward to many more books from her. I am a fan.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This was a very dark version of Snow White and I loved it. It was very fitting of the real story which in principle was a dark story. I think that you'll love it. I know that I did.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|I'm a huge Lisa Kleypas fan and love the Wallflowers. This, however, was by far my favorite. It is a credit to Kleypas that the same St. Vincent who is a scumbag at the end of book #2 could turn into such a dreamboat by the end of book 3. Off all the Wallflower novels, this one is the true love story.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This is one of those movies that I was on the fence about. The commercials looked great but I have never been a huge Captain America fan. I'm so glad that I took a chance on it because it ended up being an amazing movie. If you're like I was and you're still undecided then you should give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am so enthralled with time travel that I had to read this one. This is Stephen King at his best. I was looking forward to reading this book after each time I had to put it down and then when I finished reading I wish there was more. So many books run out of steam at the end, but this one does not. It holds you right to the last word.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I didn't read the Hunger Games books so I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into the theater. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie and I'm not usually one to play into that, but this one did pique my curiosity. I'm so glad that I took a chance on it. This is easily the best movie of 2012.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|We need to understand, and hear from the people who actually fight for our rights. How they feel, How politics affect their ability to do their  job.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I thought I hated this book for the first half, but I'm glad I persisted. The ending really had me reeling, and I finally connected to the majority of the characters. I could see people I knew in some of them- scary but familiar.
030758836X|3.0|Filthy language alert. The book is well written and suspenseful; however, the characters had no redeeming qualities. I was very disappointed after all the hype.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Once you get used to the epistolary format, this book sucks you in and doesn't let you go. I read this at least once a year, if not more. Every time I reach the ending, it brings the same joy I felt the first time!
B00005JM02|5.0|I may be a senior but I loved Finding Nemo. Bought it at Amazon (of course), but I laugh when about a dozen or so sea gulls start going \\"MINE, MINE\\".<br />Kids of all ages ill enjy it.
B0054X3FQO|1.0|Miranda doesn't really know how to write. She seems like a very nice, albeit dumb girl. Her book mainly consists of quotations from other self help books and some drawings of flowers. Not worth the money- borrow it from the library!
0765325950|5.0|I starting reading Mr. Jordan's series 7 years ago and each of the times I've reread his books in anticipation of a new release I cannot put them down. This one was no exception, and I stayed up until 7 am desperate to finish. Thanks to all who helped bring this amazing series to an end. I hope those who downrated this ask themselves if judgments made without knowledge show anything except pettiness.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I simply adore almost anything by Kate Morton (except The Distant Hours didn't quite hit the spot).<br />This book was complicated, twisted and oh, so cringeworthy. I actually put it down because I kept cringing at the things Dolly did, it became painful. That's how you know you're connecting with the book.<br />I want to marry Jimmy myself.<br />Overall, if you love this genre, this era, Kate Morton or anything along those lines- buy it. You won't regret it.
0307744434|1.0|Review from Martinitimes.com<br /><br />Quite honestly... this book had a lot of hype and I bought it for $10 on a whim. I did not read reviews prior to getting it. I heard there was romance and it was about a circus...so I was in from the get go, willing to try this tale.<br /><br />For most people. You either absolutely love this book or you hate it. I'm part of the haters group. I just honestly can't take the amount of confusion and endless questions that came from this read. Here are my thoughts as I was reading it.<br /><br />The prologue was interesting with is descriptive words painting the picture of anticipation. If you enjoy having things told instead of showed to you in your books, you'll find the endless amount of minute descriptions about food and smells charming. To me it was gagging and too much.<br /><br />From what I gathered about this book. Two guys, who like to use other people to fight their battles, engage in another one. A famous illusionist trains his daughter and the other guy finds an orphan, and then they spend the next 16 years training their chosen.<br /><br />The man training his daughter, Hector Bowen, is outrageously cruel towards his daughter all in the name of practicing for the upcoming challenge readers have no idea about.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />The other guy, who is only described as the man in a grey suit, just locks up Marco in a house of books. He doesn't even care for to learn the boy's name `til decades later.<br /><br />This story jumps around so much and it brings up so many questions and absolutely no answers. This is a very frustrating read. I forced myself to keep reading because everyone said it was worth it...but it wasn't!<br /><br />The romance in my opinion was supposed to be Celia and Marco, but it was forced, unrealistic, and just a joke to me. The main point of this book was not the romance and more about the never ending descriptions of setting.<br /><br />The Night Circus was too confusing and skipped everywhere. I don't know what others saw in this tale. All I got from it was a headache. Overall, I wanted to shoot myself for wasting money and life on this over-hyped coffee table decoration.rywhere.

B003VANOFY|3.0|these have great range. I have a 3200sqft house and I can walk around upstairs - downstairs with no problems. However I simply did not love the sound that came out of these, I read some other reviews about an equalizer on them that I did not play with so that may have been my problem. Overall quality of the build is excellent. Good job Logitech once again for a great product.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's is a great mind exercise but it can cost money to get hints and my little sister always needs help
B003P8D6JQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite of the Twilight series.  I was not happy with the new soundtracks and they got more mainstream. But these and the others are original and good songs.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Not cool time limit sucks no time to build anything why does the real minecraft have to be so much money :( :( :( :( :( &gt;:(
B0053O89JM|5.0|Love the series, but with work, tend to miss some episodes. Buying the season DVD is a great way to catchup and rewatch previous episodes I enjoyed. My own way of having a &#34;House-a-thon&#34;!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It was ok but it's just too much words you only need 1 sentence for each word. Other than that it was good
B009E3EY4M|2.0|Yeah...it's Zeppelin. And yeah it's cool to see them do the reunion thing. But that's about it.<br /><br />Even though I've never been a huge fan I thought I'd give this a whirl especially given the plethora of 5 star reviews here. I even remember being \\"camped out\\" for concert tickets to see them the day that John Bonham died. Then I was more ticked off that I had just spent 3 days waiting on a sidewalk with my stoner buddies than the fact the they would be no more. But I was a kid.<br /><br />Now...3 plus decades later...I still just don't get these guys. Yeah I know their music. Yeah I've tried over my life time to \\"get it\\". But no matter what...I've just never quite understood how they got to be as popular as they are. They are all...less both Bonhams...sub par musicians at best.<br /><br />OK...to the point cause I'm not going to compete with the 100's of 5 stars. But if you've ever thought like me...that they've always just been mediocre at best than this is for you.<br /><br />Video quality is good but the show / stage itself is quite plain and vanilla. No special light show design or anything too high tech. DTS HD audio is good and clear but just a tad too harsh on the low end. Not much use of the surrounds in the 5.1 but all in all it's bearable.<br /><br />Now onto the musicianship. Jason Bonham does a competent job. He's actually the best player on the stage. Robert Plant does OK for his age though his voice isn't young anymore. John Paul Jones...eh nothing special. A low grade bass player at best. But what makes this concert 2 stars ...is that Jimmy Page's performance is just absolutely horrid! Completely ruins the show. It's shameful really. To the point that Plant refuses to do more shows with them. How they allowed this to be released and have any sort of pride as musicians is beyond me. They probably were forced by contract. I've never thought of him as a quality guitar player but this is sad really. Very sloppy, off key, overly distorted, timing off, etc etc. Seriously... you can find 12 year old kids on YouTube that are stellar guitar players in comparison. His playing is just inexcusable. There just aren't enough negative adjectives to describe just how bad he is. He should be embarrassed and apologetic. Within 30 seconds of the opening I had 3 people in my theater room look at me almost in unison and say \\"this sucks\\"!<br /><br />Honestly if it wasn't the Zep \\"reunion\\" thing I'd give this whole Blu Ray ZERO stars. Watched it twice and now it will go into the dust bin of faded memories. Maybe 10 years from now I can sell it used for something.<br /><br />BTW...All of Plants' solo and collaborative work ...IE band and music...are far superior in ever respect to whats here.<br /><br />If you're a fan get it for the nostalgia. For that matter if you're a fan you probably already own it and are lapping it up.<br /><br />I'll stick with Rush.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I didn't have any particularly high expectations when I picked this up as a free app of the day. But once I actually got around to playing it, I found it to be very entertaining. Draw a stickman and his friend, and then go rescue him on adventures through a book.
B007XNAPNY|3.0|However if you're not a huge fan...well...it's not too bad.<br /><br />Bought this more to add to our Blu Ray concert collection really. Figured at 15 bucks why not. I have to admit that I know only about half the music on this disc. The newer stuff isn't bad but I'm just not familiar with it. The performance here is pretty good. Though these guys are a little too bland and feminine at times for my taste. Not exactly stellar musicians but they have a unique sound and put forth a good show.<br /><br />I mostly want to comment on the audio / video quality. DTS HD is very good bordering on excellent. Video quality is very good too.<br /><br />However...why I give this 3 stars instead of 5 is solely based on the never ending cut and pan and zoom and edit and on and on....<br /><br />This entire Blu Ray is shot in 1 second or less spinets. I know this is a trend in concert videos but it's incredibly annoying. There are many parts of this show where the camera angle and scene are literally changing ever half second. There are very few shots that last more than 2 seconds. Really. We counted. It's endless.<br /><br />If you are happy with this kind of editing and are a fan then this is a great show. Just hard for me to watch too long.

0385523394|4.0|ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK was a book I read on a whim, found amongst my shelves from some long ago thrift store trip I assume. It's a prison memoir about a long ago crime, a year in federal prison, books, microwaves, uniforms, and navigating the social structures of a women's penal camp. I mean, what is there to resist about that premise?<br /><br />Piper Kerman helped smuggle money while head over heels in love with her handler, a woman who would later help stab her in the back. She got out of it, though, and met the man of her dreams and got a wonderful job. And suddenly the police find her years later. A trial takes years to happen and then suddenly wham, she's sentenced to prison, another several years in the waiting.<br /><br />I have never been to prison except for playing softball for two years at a field right next to the county jail (\\"Officer Warren, please report to Cell Block B immediately\\").  With Ms. Kerman's account of prison life, from mail to strip searches to searching for meaning, I felt like - for a few hours - that I was there, which leads me to my mail complaint about the book...<br /><br />It's prison. Ms. Kerman spends a good portion of the book whining about the treatment she receives behind bars, from having to be strip searched before and after seeing her fianc&eacute;e once a week, to the hoopla over Martha Stewart possibly going to the same prison as her. If you are in prison, no matter how outdated, it is because you are serving a punishment. Sure, drug offenses on the whole are outdated and the war against... Okay, I am not going to make this a political thing. If you want my political views, head over to Megan's Political Views dot Com and see that such a website does not exist because I know better than to mix book reviews and socialist liberal themes.<br /><br />(But seriously, her sentence was really silly.)<br /><br />Back to the point. If you are in prison, it's supposed to be a punishment. Federal prison is a resort compared to county lockup. I know a recovering addict who spent three months locked in a rural county jail sleeping on a mattress on the floor with no outdoor recreation, no access to mental services, no access to NA meetings, having no access to friends and family, all while desperately trying to get clean. It could be worse.<br /><br />Ms. Kerman's style of writing is very to the point and blunt. Don't go into this expecting ravishing prose that will sweep you off your feet. But what I really enjoyed about this one was the story and the tales of the relationships Ms. Kerman formed with those around her, and that was what really swayed my writing. Stylistically, this book would warrant a three star rating, but based on the merit of her story and how it compelled me onward to read it in one sitting, this one gets a four.<br /><br />VERDICT: Although the author uses plenty of time to complain about what happened, ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK is a fascinating look into America's prison system - complete with plenty of Martha Stewart mentions.ckup.

Stylistically, this book would warrant a three star rating, but based on the merit of her story and how it compelled me onward to read it in one sitting, this one gets a four.<br /><br />VERDICT: Although the author uses plenty of time to complain about what happened, ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK is a fascinating look into America's prison system - complete with plenty of Martha Stewart mentions.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|This is a great update to 1080p from the original. Also, the audio has been converted to an awesome 5.1 configuration.  The story is still the same, but what a story?  Arnold is as perfect as he ever was.  Rumors are still around about a reprise of his classic character.  I can only hope.  Still, there is The Expendables...
141659521X|5.0|I have the whole Mitch Rapp series.  This saga is right up there with what you would expect of a Vince Flynn book.  I really enjoyed the tying in of previous plots into this book.  I found it really brillant the way he brought the experiences of his wife's death and the dealing of her killer quite interesting.  To a reader who did not know the whole story they still can pick-up on the idea.<br /><br />Found this to be a very enjoying read and just about the top of the Mitch Rapp series.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This film is a great sequel to the original.  The story is good.  Placing Don Cheedle (sp?) was a great choice.  This is so much more than a pop corn film.  You want the hero to win.  The bad guys to die.  Everybody can enjoy this film.  BTW, a good surround system is great with this Blu-Ray...
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I love this app! It is challenging, creative, and fun! I can play this game for hours. You'll love it too'
B0013ND36G|5.0|This film is a worthy third piece to the Terminator franchise.  Good story.  Good acting.  The entire series comes true fold in this film.  If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed.  The Blu-Ray copy is awesome.  Buy the entire series on Blu-Ray.  You will not be disappointed.
B0091REZMW|2.0|All the other reviews are correct. Too many pop ups, too much money.... I didn't like this game. Enough said.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This is truly a classic from the start.  All the actors are at the top of there game.  The (short) Bill Murry addition is note worthy.  I was scared, and laughed.  Not many films can do that.  Buy it.  Watch it once or twice a year.  You'll feel better.  Don't get bit, and hid those Twinkies.... :-)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app! Thanks!<br />The graphics are lovely, it is a great way to get info on your device at a glance.
B009MO5960|5.0|This film in the series is just that.  Action, action, action...  A bit short on story.  Still I was entertained.  Lets face it.  Milla is so awesome.  I will watch this film again, and again...
0937381888|5.0|This is an excellent handbook. The author goes into extreme depth and covers everything in a comprehensive fashion. I appreciate his knowledge and the fact that he writes it in a way that is easy for most to understand. I've been brewing for five years now and still refer to this book and re-read many portions just to keep sharp.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I cannot endorse this film as a true \\"pre-quel\\", but I can say that I truly enjoyed every minute of this film.  You must watch it at least three times to get the entire story.  Then, you can place it in the Alien(s) story.  I know they are making a sequile part two.  Hopefully this will iron out the story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good story line. Great actors and an overall great show!!! Very graphic but still a must see series especially since there aren't many left now that reality has taken over!
B0061QD7YS|5.0|As a young boy, this film amazed me.  As an adult, this film reminds be what it is to be in love, and appreciative of all the joyful things this world has to offer.  When I feel down, I watch this film.  Then, and only then can I feel that things are ok.  Things are going to be ok.  I hope you all feel the same way.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This was very real and therefore very frightening<br />I wanted more at the end...but I guess we know how it ends
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is truly the film that set this franchise apart from all the others.  Everyone was at the top of there game.  The buzz on this film was out so long before it came out, that one could toss it aside, but the result was that this one was a film that people went to the theaters again.  A classic in its own time...  So it shall be...
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I admired the main character and reallty enjoyed meeting all those he met on his journey<br />A quick and enjoyable read
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Huge fan of all the \\"Underworld\\" series films.  This one is such a fun ride.  As always, this series is so much better a vampire/werewolf film series than anything out there.  You will not be disappointed.
B003UV8ZS0|5.0|I was very late finding this gem...and now there is a movie, of course<br />This is a must read for everyone!
B008FOB124|5.0|I had never heard of Anastasis until I was listening to 91x.  This CD is awesome.  One of those that you need to listen to it from start to finish.  A Sunday morning works for me.  Wake up.  Start the CD, then escape into a new world that only this CD can give you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As usual the first is the best...sequels are never as good<br />A mix of real life and fantasy, a love story and an action drama
B005S9EKCW|4.0|It has got everything the original musical has. A tad long but the moving performances make up for it. Watch Anne Hathaway sing her guts out in the pivotal scene to I Dreamed a Dream and you will know why. Helena Bonham Carter is obviously underrated and overlooked for providing excellent comic relief with Sacha Baron Cohen. Hugh Jackman shows his acting prowess. The only sore eye is Russell Crowe whose singing live has probably hindered his ability to act at the same time. For those naysayers, remember this is a movie adaptation and not a musical, so the elements of drama is prevalent.
0380713802|3.0|While some parts were funny and he visits many out-of-the-way places, his constant complaining and haughtiness gets old. He complains often about the natives, especially the Germans, and he complains about tourists, especially American (but what is he exactly)? He doesn't speak any other language, except maybe a phrase anyone can learn in a guidebook. Also, not all of his humor is enjoyable, but I'll leave this to individual taste. All in all, I liked reading about foreign places but the book soon became stereotypical, repetitive, and annoying.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Plodding at times in the beginning but this rom-com builds up quite nicely as it goes. The surprise here is really Bradley Cooper of \\"The Hangover \\" series. He actually plays the neurotic Patrick with aplomb, idiosyncrasies included. Of course, the usually great Jennifer Lawrence gets in the act, playing the unexpected weird-widow saviour to Patrick. The result is a witty and emotional movie with sizzling chemistry between the two unlikely leads. Great support from Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro. This makes the first movie since 1981's Reds to have nominations in ALL four acting categories. And it's no wonder David O' Russell and the movie are up for Best Director and Best Picture because Silver Linings Playbook is exactly the kind of sweet sentimental film that is not too heavy on message or intent.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Pitch Perfect is a funny movie with a great ending. Loved the music. We enjoyed it so much we rented it twice.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I have really enjoyed this show. The character development from the first episode to the last was great. I got this in on Friday and finished watching the entire season last night! Got to love Schmidt and the scene with Zoey and Justin Long!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game is Awesome And it has more New things than temple run and also subway surfer is the boss
140131046X|5.0|I purchased \\"Have a Little Faith\\" by Mitch Albom, after receiving a recommendation to read this book.This was such an uplifting novel that I couldn't put down.Such an emotional rollercoaster.I felt so good after reading this novel.\\"Have a little Faith\\" is a true story nonfiction book that can open your eyes and heart, and allow you to realize how precious life is.It is about believing in something and the two men who taught him how.<br /><br />The novel centers around three people:Mitch, a jewish man who inter married who no longer had time for religion, and Albert (Reb), a jewish rabbi, and Henry, a pastor of \\"I am my Brother's Keeper Ministry\\", an intercity church.The Reb was Mitch's rabbi growing up.Both men play a very important part in Mitch's life.<br /><br />Albert in the spring of 2000 was eighty two and had made a strange request of Mitch.\\"Will you do my eulogy?.\\" Mitch had agreed to honor his request but wanted to get to know him better.And there starts the journey...<br /><br />I am very proud to have had the honor of reading this book.Everybody should read this book...and they will never be the same.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|This is a great app to get. This works GREAT with your e-mail account(s). It is most worth the money.
B008PZ69T8|2.0|The music is well-performed, but there is nothing here that is interesting.  This is massage music, something for the background.
0765325950|5.0|A great end to a fantastic series; I loved it. I'm sad that this decades-long period of my life is over, but also glad that when the ending did come, it was so magnificently exquisite.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Michael Connelly comes through again with another great Harry Bosch novel. If you've read any of the Harry Bosch books you'll love this.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie definitely has some insane violence so not one for children. My husband and I watched together late at night.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is really good! I think I like it better than the first one. This is my second time reading it and I am glad I read it again. I had forgotten most of it.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The story line is too gory. The premise of children being killed  and maimed left me with an uneasy feeling.
B000M5NRLC|1.0|I do not like this because I purchased it thinking it was a DVD and it would not let me return it. So, I have this movie that I am not even able to watch.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The idea of children being forced to kill children left me with a sick feeling. I am somewhat disturbed that so many young people read and liked it.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Love this album. I got the non-explicit version (thanks amazon for reducing it in line with the regular version).<br />Highlights for me are Treasure, When I was Your Man, and Money Make Her Smile (fantastic song!)
B0017YZIL4|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present for my husband.  He is mesmerized  by it.  Says it was his favorite gift.  If you like Jazz Guitar, This is definitely one for you.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|I am completely satisfied with the purchase. This is a excelent merorabillia because we love rock and roll. The booklet is very interesting , history of the band and rare photos.
B001AQMBNC|5.0|This review is of the Blu-Ray.<br />This film is kind of a rarety in HD.<br />I originally just wanted to watch tis film on cable in HD.<br />I'm on a fixed imcome.<br />So I can't buy every Blu-Ray that comes along/but all that was available on comcast was the standar def version of this film.<br />So I checked on amazon.com.<br />And this BD came up.<br />It was only  $ 10.00<br />So I bought it.<br />The disc has no special featires.<br />And the A/V presentation while very good.<br />Is not among Sony pictures best/but for the money.<br />If you're looking for a HD copy of this film you can't go wrong

B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Another great movie starring Kevin Costner.  There are many memorable scenes and some great dialogue.  I wish they had left out all the cursing but that's tinsel town, isn't it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A quick paced fun read.  With enough hints dropped so that you are fairly certain what the next twist will be.  A read this book in half hour to hour chunks as the rest of my family was watching the football games.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob: Well written, great plot, very plausible, keeps reader reading and after finishing, the reader is thinking about the book.
B002YVAT72|4.0|Used with MAC; easy to set up and use. Great instructions. Pop in CD, download software, open app, adjust sound level, press record, and mark tracks! Automatically downloads music to itunes. Great listening to my old albums. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because with MAC you have to mark tracks as one song ends and before next starts (one click). I am really enjoying it!
B002W5UVSM|1.0|Yuck. Just Yuck. Don't waste your time or money on this. I  read a Tom Grace thriller right after to get the putrid images from 'Dunces' out of my head.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Really??  The same, over and over!  It got kind of boring after the first book, but by the third book, there was A LITTLE bit of a plot to help me finish.

B005S9ELVC|4.0|\\"Gangster Squad\\" is an old-fashioned crime-fighting thriller set in the L.A. of the late 1940's, complete with period sets, a solid cast, and a suspenseful story.  It claims to be based on a true story, but the average viewer probably won't worry about the history.  The average viewer will be too busy wondering just how vicious the fight between two-fisted mobster Mickey Cohen and a group of vigilante cops is going to get, and who might get hurt in the process.<br /><br />As the story opens, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is staking out his criminal turf, while most of the police force has been paid to look the other way.  The police chief (a grizzled Nick Nolte) taps honest police sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to set up an off-the-books gangster squad.  With the help of his wife, O'Mara picks five other police officers prepared to take on Cohen and his mob.  Among them is Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), O'Mara's army buddy, who also happens to have a very dangerous thing going with Cohen's moll (Emma Stone).  The gangster squad gets to work, and Mickey Cohen soon becomes aware that his operation is being dismantled right under his nose.  Cohen will come after the gangster squad, and their friends and families, setting up a big finale at an L.A. hotel.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is perhaps a little uneven, but its best moments make up for it.  The gunfights are pretty exciting, and the movie makes the good guys worry about the collateral damage.  Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are quite good together, as in a different way are Josh Brolin and Mireille Enos, who plays his wife.  The movie has an old-fashioned ending, but that is the point.  Recommended.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Most games that you get for your phone or Android are fun for about an hour or two (at least for me). I play them for a bit, get bored, and never seem to come back to them. This game is the exception however. I have stayed up WAY to late every night this week playing this game.

B008X8QCTO|1.0|This game freezes up on my Motorola Xoom at the point where you put the battery into the popcorn machine. This is very dissapointing as I did actually pay money for this game.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is one of the most inventive games I have ever played!  I don't know if I have enough superlatives to heap on this game.  The whole scenario is very original, the graphics and music are fantastic, and the continuous variety of gameplay makes it very hard to put down.  My only complaint is that a few of the levels were almost impossible for me, until I found walkthroughs... but I'm not the most skilled game player in the world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love when you can play together with your friends.The best part is about when the creatures of the night kill you
B002361MLA|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It is not always easy to digest but it is life changing when you do!  If you want to find sanity and joy your life this book is a must.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|As of now there are 130 five stars; 130 people who wouldn't know a good movie from the trash they put on the curb this morning. God this is bad. About 50 to 60% of the way through I gave up and skipped to the end to prevent any further suffering; mine. The only way I would have given this more stars would have been if the Judges had died horrible deaths and the criminals lived happily ever after. Save your money folks.
0061122416|5.0|I bought this book for my brother after reading about a woman whose life changed after she read it.  My brother reviews it saying 'With a simple tale it provides great insight into life and our own 'personal legends'. '  He highly recommends it.

B00846REIS|5.0|Great book. Sylvia Day is an excellent writer  I would choose any book this author has written. Romance is a good part of the novel but an interesting story follows.
034580404X|5.0|Great books. Came quickly and was in good shape. I like to have the holder to return the books to
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The film's fantastic, the actors are fantastic, and the music's fantastic.  The only thing against this album is that it's not the *complete* compilation of all the music in the film.  If you're looking for the complete collection, keep your eyes peeled for a &#34;Deluxe&#34; edition that will probably be released in a couple of months.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel, although at times it was a bit unbelievable, it did keep my interest, I think there will be a book 2
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Worth the time to read Goodwin's amazingly written tome about Lincoln. She seamlessly weaves in various source material, from diaries, newspapers, interviews, etc. into a thorough examination of LIncoln's ascent to the presidency through his death. You will learn far more than you ever needed to know about the members of his cabinet, but it does explain their synergy as a team. She clearly is a huge Lincoln fan, so it's not clear how much bias there may be in what she chooses to include ( and exclude, though with the length of this book, I would assume that's not a great deal). But it is compelling reading and is worth the time.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|It is so hard for me to put in words how much I love this album. Every since I purchased it, I cannot listen to anything else, as if nothing else is good enough. For me this Album has everything, it is deep, dark, sexy, itimate and dirty. The album mixes R&B , Rock & roll, Hip Hop, drugs and edge. I can listen to the entire trilogy through but, my favorite songs are High for this, The morning, Wicked games, The party & The After Party, Life of the party, Rolling Stone, Heaven or Vegas, D.D ( which is the best Michael Jackson remake I have ever heard) and The Fall.  If you are reading reviews because you are unsure about purchasing the album I say DO IT! you will not be dissapointed.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Wife had half of the discs not work (freeze/dvds skips). Wife looked up online reveiws and I guess this  is a common problem even when you get the exchange dvds!

0765325950|5.0|This was a fantastic ending to a series I love dearly.  Wrapped everything up without any real questions remaining.  Only minor complaint is that I wish the epilogue was like 200 pages longer to give the reader an idea of what the world will be like after the conflicts are over.
B008VBYN80|4.0|kingdoms and lords is a good game. easy to learn and play. very fun and interesting. I recommend this game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think its safe to say I am now addicted to pinterest! It's so fun! I totally recommend getting this app.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I chose the 5 star rating simply because Tom cruise, and Jamie foxx are at the top of thier acting career. Michael Mann is a wonderful director, and i have to say this is his best movie. I also gave a 5 star rating simply because the product listing said used, i recieved the movie in an un-opened box. (brand new)
B005UG542S|5.0|This is definitely better than the first installment of this movie.  I have watched and loved all of the Harry Potter movies.  The first installment of this last film was a bit long and tedious.  This installment is where all the action is.  It starts and doesn't stop until the end in terms of action.  It goes by quite fast.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Purchased for my daughter who really enjoys Michael B.  His voice is similar to Frank Sinatra's.  Enjoyed his renditions,  You will enjoy this CD if you like Sinatra.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I only wanted to watch the movie because of Justin Timberlake, but it was all around good. Plausible story line, unlike so many other movies, and everyone, including Clint, does their character justice. Ok...the ending is not quite so plausible, but it was good Hollywood movie making
B000NQRR1Q|3.0|I enjoyed this story because I like when a story turns into a story about something else. (SPOILER) Corso was hired to compare several books to check for authenticity, but the actual story became how Corso eventually volunteered to become the devil's apprentice - sort of an origin story from the villan's point of view. As I had no idea going in that that was the story's subject, as Corso himself didn't know until the story's end that he would be serving the devil, I liked the way the story unfolded. Though Corso was morally flexible (the story began with him cheating a old sick man out of a valuable collection), I didn't see why the devil would find him so appealing that the devil (she, in this story), would protect Corso until he reached the ninth gate. In other words, except that a movie star played the role, I saw no skill set exhibited that would make Corso so attractive that the devil would protect him, as though he were a valuable commodity. Corso was willing to lie and cheat, but as he is often in the midst of devil worshippers and/or murderers in this story, his behavior, though bad, was lightweight awful when compared to some of the other characters - in other words he didn't seem more evil than the other evildoers, in several instances, he seemed less evil, so apparently, in this film the devil wasn't looking for outright evil.  What characteristics the devil sought then, were not clearly specified, which I didn't like.  Something I did like was how the devil protected her protege; often film villans rat out their team so frequently, the audience wonders how they acquire assistants; it was believable to see a story where the villan takes care of her own.  I  didn't like the way the story ended, with Corso going through the ninth gate - at that point I felt the story was just beginning and I wanted to know his fate.  Also, I didn't understand why Corso wanted to join the devil's team in the end. Corso had sex with the devil right before he joined up, and the audience witnesses that, but the devil wasn't the only person he had sex with in the story, and he seemed to enjoy the other sex as well, so I didn't understand why sex with the devil in and of itself was so appealing that Corso would change his entire way of life.  Story was weak there. Though satan was a character in the film, the film was not at all scary, more a thriller. Overall, I liked the way the story was told - it could have been titled, how I became the devil's apprentice, and I liked that I got to discover that that was the story. After I saw that that was the story, I thought the story should have explained: (1) why did the devil want Corso, and (2) why did Corso want the devil. I think all the actresses/actors did a very good job.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Read a review that said watching Tom Cruise channel Axel Rose was worth the price of admission. I disagree, although if I hadn't had such big expectations, I might have been impressed
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I really like this production of Persuasion as all the actresses/actors are so good - it's a real cinderalla story, with the underappreciated Ann finally gaining enough confidence in her own abilities to chose what she knows is best for her, and the audience gets to come along for the ride.  (SPOILER) Her captain, previously denied her hand, returns to the area, rich, successful and determined to ignore her, but the quality of Ann's spirit is such that she is impossible to ignore (she provides so much to all those she is around).  It doesn't hurt for her captain to learn that another kindly landowner (Charles, now her brother-in-law) previously found her desirable, and the captain also sees that his own man, Captain Bennett, and a Mr. Eliot, also find Ann appealing, and so, eventually, Ann's captain is able to let go of his hurt pride and ask for her hand again, and this time, a smarter Ann knows what to do.  After she learns the field is clear, Ann becomes very proactive - in fact, in the 19th century this Ann would have definitely been considered forward, if not a hussy.  Ann really pushes it, and it is great to see her go after her man.  The story of Ann and her captain, and her unappreciative family is well told.  The weak points in the story include the Mr. Eliot subplot - as Mr. Eliot was presented as a villan and wished to marry into the family not for love, but to better advance his agenda, and as Elizabeth obviously liked him, it would have made more sense for Mr. Eliot, as an opportunistic villan, to set his cap at Elizabeth - it made no sense for him to pursue Ann, when Elizabeth was there and interested.  So this villan made no sense, which was a story flaw.  Also, I didn't really understand the basis for the antipathy on Elizabeth's part toward Ann.  Had Ann been unusually beautiful I could have understood Elizabeth's jealousy, but both actresses were attractive enough, I didn't see that much difference between them physically, so I wish it had been explained why Elizabeth disliked Ann so.  Really, all the acting was very fine, Ann's father (Baron and proud of it, the senior Mr. Eliot), Ann's younger sister, Mary, the Musgroves - what a treat all these superb actresses and actors give us.  As I said, the only flaw I saw was the young Mr. Eliot story line, but this weakness didn't ultimately mar the story for me, I deducted one point for it, but if there was a 4 and a half star selection, I would have chosen that.  Really like this production.
B008EEHRAU|5.0|Great film! I think Ive watched it 50 times over the years.Good story, Good music, good acting! All around fun!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My son loves to play this game as is much as he loves his kindle. My boyfriend and I love to play it too. Great graphics and gameplay. Great job Game loft.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Had to watch it twice. I couldn't get Kristen Stewart's Twilight character out of my head!!! LOL Her acting style is unchanged. Kept waiting for the vampire and werewolf!! LOL  Once I was able to get over that hump, I could sit back and really enjoy this movie. Very glad it's part of our DVD collection.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I would love this app since I love browsing pinterest, but it is soooo slow with loading the pins.  It even takes at least 5 minutes to load up my own pins.  Rather use the net for pinterest.
B001DDBCUA|1.0|We all know that the movie is great.  My gripe is that the movie is not the original English version.  The version I received is an English/French version.  The front and back cover of the DVD is in English and French.  Had I known this, I would not have purchased from this seller.  I haven't opened the DVD so I cannot comment if the quality is good or not.  I had purchased 4 of them as gifts for my girlfriends and now I need to see if I can return the product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book. I would read it again. I especially liked all the changes in the plot. I won`t tell you anymore, since I wouldn't want to ruin it for others<br /><br />Netflix Oki<br /><br />Netflix<br />'
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Typical Clancy.  Lots of action interspersed with acronyms and information about weapons.  Needs more character development.  Still a fun read.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|this was the best item it had a lot of disc good shows and one of the best seasons i love every minute of it
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I purchased this film because original from play.com but it was the UK version. Whatever you do don't buy the UK of this film. They ripped us off big time. Most of the extras that come with the American version aren't included in the UK version and also to rub more salt in the wound it's also edited. When Colsen get's stabbed from behind they edited that part out.<br />I give this film 5 stars because it's simply Marvellous. The American Version is the definitive copy and if, like me, you're a fan, then buy GOD stop reading my review and GO BUY NOW.<br /><br />All that is left is to do is buy a 3dtv as I can currently using an old hdtv
B00008G8LY|5.0|I've been meaning to get this movie for a while, just kept forgetting. I would call this one of James Cameron's best movies. And when you see the 1hr behind the scene documentary, you gain a greater appreciation for the film (available in 6 pieces on YouTube).<br /><br />If you are a features-junkie, look for The Abyss with the white front as that, I believe, has more features (Amazon has it).
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is one of my favorite fictional characters bar None!  If I didn't know he was fictional, I'd think he was me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a definite five-star book and I will probably buy another of Nicholas Sparks' books.  I have recommended it to other people who has e-readers.  The ending was so good and I had to keep reading.
1934030198|5.0|I purchased for my husband, who is a beginner at all aspects of a tri.  This probably is overkill for that, but hopefully can come in handy as we progress into the sport.
B008476HBM|5.0|Loved this book.  Love all the characters.  One of my all time favorite love stories!  All young girls should be required to read it....
B009HEJXFS|1.0|Of the hundreds of movies that I've seen in my 38 years, I've rarely met one where I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes.  Men in Black 3 was so utterly gross and stupid that we gave up after about six minutes.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|This film snuck up on me. Everyone in the cast tackled real life issues with acting grace. Glad to see the Academy take notice. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawerence and Robert DeNiro are the trinity that make this film original and heartfelt.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good book. Easy read. Try it I think you'll like it. Is there another? Need to know if they stayed together.
0765325950|1.0|When I got my kindle for Christmas I was excited about not having to lug around the final Wheel of Time book...  Who cares about bestseller lists, if the book is good its good, I don't buy something cause it made some \\"bestseller\\" list, if that was the case I'd be fluent in Twilight and 50 Shades.  Not only did it take 20 years to write these books, wait for them, have Robert pass, and wait for the end, now I have to accept that the people in charge of this book are so old they don't realize the entire game has changed.  Robert's books won't be discovered by readers of the future on some library shelf as I discovered it, instead it will be on a forum post of great fantasy on something like Reddit, and the kid will click to download.  Luckily for him, he will be able to download all 14 in like 5 sec, and not have to put up with this unnecessary waiting crap.<br /><br />NO E-BOOK - 1 Star Protest
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Love this movie. Funny relating to authors and artists from the past in a comedic way. Very funny and entertaining. It has become a classic for my family!
1419705849|5.0|A gook my 9 year old great granddaughter wanted, so I ordered this one for her. She could not stop reading it every chance she had. It was easy for her to read, and it held her attention. Love to see her read as reading is so very important. Upon returning from the Christmas break, her class went to the library and she has checked out another Wimpy Kid book. Again, another easy book for reading.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I have always liked King's books. This one reminded me of the times I wished Kennedy's death never happened. After I finished it it occurred  to me that maybe things happen the way they were meant to be.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|If you like holding onto safe subjects, you know, ones that don't involve incest, child abuse, and rape, you might want to stay away from HOPELESS. It's teen fiction, or at least it involves teenagers, but it's geared toward a more mature audience. It has what you might call stereotypical characters, you know, the slutty girl, the one who would like to fit in, and the mysterious jock, but the characters didn't feel stereotypical, or at least as much as they could have anyway. The pages turned relatively easily, and I found myself rooting for Sky and Dean Holder with the slutty best friend conveniently out of the picture.<br /><br />Sky and Dean have a complicated, trauma-filled relationship, most of which you learn later, so I really don't want to give too many details away. Like the book, it's a relationship that's heavier than any teenager should have to go through, and so it's really hard not to root for them. You want them to work things out. And if you're a woman, it'd be hard not to be totally into Dean, the way Sky is.<br /><br />Sky has led a technology-free life, which is pretty impressive in this day and age. Yet, Colleen Hoover totally had me buying that as well. HOPELESS may have been independently-written and produced, yet it doesn't feel that way at all. It's taken Amazon by storm, and that was the main reason it grabbed my attention. The beginning certainly did as well, as it takes a moment a couple of months later in the book and slams the reader with it right away. HOPELESS has a bit of a diary aspect to it with the date and time stamp, as the book and the reader bounce around in time a bit. If you like books dealing with heavy subject matter, this is one book you probably don't want to miss.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B008S4YZCO|4.0|We are really enjoying the game. I love the fun that me and my daughter share together.  It's like caring for pets without all the of the expenses. You will find this game to be quite enjoyable .
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Very crisp, easy to read app.  What you would expect from The Weather Channel.  Easy to use. Current, 5-Day, 10-Day, right at your fingertips.  I like this one.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|based on other reviews, I never installed the software. It works fine in HID mode with the games I tested, connwcrting to my nexus 4 and nexus 10.<br /><br />Also connected and works with my PC.<br /><br />The sticks are pretty lousy though and offer very little precision. Also, many buttons cannot be mapped when using HID MODE.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an amazing book. Good job Suzanne Collins. One of the best books I have ever read. I give it 5 stars
B002SF9YNO|2.0|I'm a cinephile and I like a lot of Asian movies, especially from Japan and Korea. For reference my favorite movie in the world is Oldboy.<br />It doesn't surprise me that so many Americans like this movie so much. It is not written or directed in the intricate and edgy style of new Japanese cinema; it's instead closely related to standard American drama movies full of cheesy details, tired formulas and overacting.<br />Parts of the story such as the way the dead are buried make a difference in our perception; given that the ceremonious preparation is not an American standard we as viewers get a glimpse of a different culture that makes us feel like we are watching something more elevated than the standard drama. We're not. This is just another little bag of old tricks that just kept making me roll my eyes like in my best days as a teenager; they had shown and mentioned the stupid rock so many times that it was just obvious that he would find it in his dead hand.<br />It is not the worst movie that I've seen because I've seen so so many, but I don't want to see it again and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody that truly appreciates hard working directors that don't resort to images of hurt puppies to make a point.
B0086700CM|5.0|Most fun game exciting and very stimulating. Started slow but catching on. It's even fun dying in this game . Keep up the good work.
B001SGEULA|4.0|I've been a fan of Oasis since mid-2009 after coming across \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Champagne Supernova\\", and \\"Supersonic\\", the latter being my most favorite song ever. There hasn't been a day since then that I didn't listen to their music. My \\"obsession\\" has made very fond of them, even post-breakup. I've purchased their first two acclaimed albums, and now, BE HERE NOW, the album that, some might say, was the end of Oasis because of overproduction, fueled by drugs.<br /><br />DEFINITELY MAYBE is a great album because of its confident attitude, inspirational lyrics, and catchy melodies that, to this day, I can't get over. \\"Rock 'N' Roll Star\\", \\"Live Forever\\", and \\"Supersonic\\" are my favorites off the album. MORNING GLORY proceeded to sound more pop, but was a landmark album in the era of Britpop. My favorites are \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Morning Glory\\", and \\"Champagne Supernova\\".<br /><br />Like all of Oasis' 30 singles, before I bought their albums, I put them all into my iPod to listen to later. Prior to listening to BE HERE NOW, I had thought its four singles - \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\", \\"Stand By Me\\", \\"Don't Go Away\\", \\"All Around the World\\" - were good, but not great. \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" was a song I avoided on my iPod many times because I thought it was just too long, so it was always at the back of the line for me. However, after putting the CD into my stereo, I was amazed at its level of rockability... If there's such a word. This song is a great opener, and it makes you want to feel like a bad*ss... 9/10<br /><br />\\"My Big Mouth\\" is a hard-rocking song, probably on par with \\"Rock 'N' Roll Star\\". For me, this is the epitome of Oasis, and it has become one of my favorites off the album for its loudness and Liam's loud vocals, especially during the chorus. Nice song to play to piss off the neighbors at night... 10/10<br /><br />When \\"Magic Pie\\" came on, I thought its opening verse was the beginning of another great song, but its poorly written and uninspiring pre-chorus andchorus destroys its potential. \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" was the first of five bloated songs on the album, and although DYKWIM's attitude and tempo equates well with its length, the same cannot be said with \\"Magic Pie\\". It goes on for too long. It's also amazing how \\"Stay Young\\" - a fan favorite - was left out of the album in favor for this mediocre song. \\"Stay Young\\" - which I'd rate a 10/10 - inevitably became a B-side - probably by a coked up Noel Gallagher - could've served as BE HERE NOW's \\"Live Forever\\" or \\"Wonderwall\\". The verses do have some redeeming qualities however... 6/10<br /><br />\\"Stand By Me\\" is an uplifting song, but the chorus gets a little repetitive... 8/10<br /><br />\\"I Hope, I Think, I Know\\" is one of my favorites off the album because I've fallen in love with its hook, which can be heard on \\"Stay Young\\". I really have to give credit to Noel for his ability to come up with some catchy melodies, and of course, for writing the lyrics that his younger brother, Liam, delivers nicely. The song sounds pop, and it's one of the more up-tempo songs on the album... 9/10<br /><br />\\"The Girl in the Dirty Shirt\\" is a nice and upbeat tune. I compare it to \\"Slide Away\\" on DEFINITELY MAYBE and \\"She's Electric\\" on MORNING GLORY as the more romantic tracks that Noel has to offer... 7/10<br /><br />I'm a fan of Johnny Depp, but I don't get all the talk about his involvement with \\"Fade In-Out\\". The song itself sounds boring personally. This is probably the weakest point on the album, and I can barely tolerate its bloated length... 5/10<br /><br />\\"Don't Go Away\\" is one of the more melancholic songs Oasis has had to offer in their first three albums (\\"Sad Song\\" on DEFINITELY MAYBE and \\"Cast No Shadow\\" on MORNING GLORY are nice songs), but this one is the most beautiful. I'm a fan of positivity, but it's indeed one of better songs off the album... At this point, I've come to realize that this album ain't so bad... 8/10<br /><br />If \\"Magic Pie\\" and \\"Fade In-Out\\"weren't so long, I wouldn't have to take a break to go to the toilet.<br /><br />I return to BE HERE NOW and listen to \\"Be Here Now\\", which returns to uptempo rock, but there's really nothing special here. It's opening riff reminds me of \\"The Hindu Times\\" on HEATHEN CHEMISTRY. It's a song about opening up your eyes and getting a grip on yourself inside... 7/10<br /><br />The first three minutes of \\"All Around the World\\" are some of the best things Noel has ever written, but the final six minutes are so bloated, it's ridiculous. Like most of the album, I don't mind the overproduction; it's the length that bothers me. \\"All Around the World\\" would've been perfect if it were six minutes long. It should've been BE HERE NOW's \\"Champagne Supernova\\", but the length just ruins it. It's like a good movie with a bad ending... 7/10 (9/10 for a shortened version)<br /><br />\\"It's Gettin' Better, Man!\\" is the final track, but should've appeared earlier for \\"All Around the World\\" to finish off the album. It's behind \\"DYKWIM\\" and \\"My Big Mouth\\" in terms of... rockability... but a fade out should've occurred after the 5:30 mark. If I was drunk, however, I wouldn't mind the longer outro... 8/10<br /><br />\\"All Around the World (Reprise)\\"... Now you're really pushing it, Mr. Gallagher... 1/10<br /><br />BE HERE NOW had the potential to be the third great album. It irritates me that Oasis' success deteriorated dramatically after the release of BE HERE NOW. Songs like \\"My Big Mouth\\" and \\"It's Gettin' Better, Man!\\" should've served as a foreshadowing that the future was indeed their's, but hubris and drugs served to be their tragic flaw. The overproduction doesn't bother me; I love Oasis because of their loudness. But like the album as a whole, \\"It's Gettin' Better, Man!\\" and \\"All Around the World\\" could've benefited from being shortened. Also, the exclusion of \\"Stay Young\\" - took me a while to discover it, and it has become one of my favorites - really hurt the album, as there isn't really a standout track that could've elevated the album as a whole. There's no sense in thinking about what could've been, \\"'cause in the end, the past means nothing,\\" but what a shame.<br /><br />But! BE HERE NOW is still a very good album that contains some very good songs. My personal favorites are \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\", \\"My Big Mouth\\", and \\"I Hope, I Think, I Know\\". I hope in the future, Noel will decide to release an album called BE HERE NOW (REMASTERED). Now that would be a better reprise, Mr. Gallagher. Instead of four, I'd give that five stars.

B0027MJU00|3.0|Predictable but was a good read. Kill club was hokey though gave some insight into how odd that could be.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|I really feel like this book started off my journey to success. After reading this book I've suddenly encountered so many other inspiring people, books, website, youtube channels and anything else inspiring you can think of.<br /><br />The content of the book is perhaps a little bit dreamy and maybe made a bit better than reality really is but the core of what the book tells you is the truest thing you'll ever read. Having a positive attitude and shifting your focus towards the positive will lead you in positive directions. There's no way around it.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book I suggest you complement the knowledge it contains by checking out the following books, people and website<br />- The 4-hour chef by Timothy Ferriss<br />- Anthony Robbins (look him up on youtube or whatever)<br />- [...]<br />- Eric Thomas a.k.a. ETthehiphoppreacher<br /><br />Overall I definitely recommend anyone that wants to change their life to give this book a try. Even if it's just to discover a new perspective =D

B009LRE040|2.0|Batman hardly uses any gadgets in the movie; instead he prefers to get angry and fist brawl everyone and gets pwned constantly doing so. I watched this with my mother who saw the first and second Batman movies when they first came out, the old ones with Jack Nicholson. All we did is laugh, laugh, and laugh during this movie. It's just that cheesy and poorly written. Throughout the film she asked \\"Why does Batman get beaten up so much in the new movies?\\" This was the first new Batman movie she had seen and I assured her it would be great...... I was embarrassed...... The last two movies were awesome, what happened? Also why does Bane talk like he's British when He's supposedly from the middle east. So confused. Yeah this one is a turd, I don't recommend watching it. If someone gives you the movie for free then maybe, but other than that don't do it. Batman The Dark Night Rises sucked.

B002OSY2T6|2.0|Bought this toy when my son was about 4 months. The lights catch his attention and he will go over to it to gnaw on its antenna, knocks it over then crawls away as it continues to talk. If I don`t turn off this toy when the baby is not playing with it, it will keep talking and making noises with every vibration it feels (it even goes off when I am talking from across the room talking). This toy is very sensitive which in some cases is good but it can be very annoying to hear \\"weeeeeeeeeee\\" and \\"yupeeeeeeee\\" over and over again. My son is now 8 months and was never really interested in this toy. Wish I would of saved my money but I bought it because I thought he would enjoy the lights and sounds, however, he mostly just ignores this toy. :(<br /><br />Update: Baby is now 10 months and I had this toy put away for a while but when I took it out he was interested. It is not his favorite toy but he does notice the lights and puts it on its side to spin it around. The most he plays with it is about five minutes at a time (I think he gets bored with it). It still gets annoying though and is extremely sensitive with noises and vibrations. Have to turn it off during the night or it goes off when a car goes by or neighbors make noises.
B003B02OQ4|5.0|This book was just fantastic. I couldn't stop turning pages. The first 3 or so chapters were kind of slow. For all you book-lovers,book critics, and big readers out there, GET THIS BOOK !!!!!!! It will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. Great book. I highly recommend that you read this. The drama, daring escapades, and all with an amazing undercurrent of uncertainty of what's to come.
