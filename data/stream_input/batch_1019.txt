0962477060|3.0|I got this book on a recommendation, and dove right in, determined to master whatever it was that I was supposed to learn.  The idea of splitting apart chord shapes and their musical counterparts is a good one for helping to simplify the guitar learning process.      However, the book fails to point out that if you just blindly make the chord shapes and strum every string (which the book instructs you to do), you will be creating disharmonic chords that sound like crap.  I am not a musician, but after several days of following the instructions I started feeling like something was seriously wrong.  Upon showing my book to a musician I know, he confirmed that it is simply wrong.  Yes, technically any combination of notes is a chord, but playing the 5th and 6th strings for several of the 'chord shapes' is wrong and this book fails to point that out.  Which seems to me like a severe oversight.  I stopped using it after that.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Great CD! One of his best since the first!! Would definitely recommend to others !!
0307454541|1.0|After forcing myself to read through 82 pages, I finally asked myself why I was spending my precious time trying to read about and process hundreds of details about characters that were meaningless to me. The book failed to grab me right from the start, a bad sign for me, but I was willing to hang in there based upon the reviews. I love books with solid storylines and vibrant, believable characters that I care about. As far as I got in this book, I found neither and decided to toss it into my next garage sale. Maybe the problem was the translation but I simply don't understand all the accolades.

Great album and great sounds! I highly recommend this album.     Slayer, keep up the good work. Can't wait for new albums from you! :o)
B002ZG997C|5.0|While not the typical movie for denzel washington he does great job and it makes for interesting movies
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have read the books and re-read the last 2 books.  I re-watched Twilight and New Moon before watching Eclipse.  I loved all of them.  I really enjoyed the books, but, I loved the Movies. Although, I felt that they ended to soon they could have been a little longer. I am really looking forward to the rest of the movies.   I would love to read books written by Alice's life or other characters life's.   The story is not over until the last book is a movie. Thanks for so much enjoyment. Bringing us into a world of pure pleasure to watch/read.

B002VPE1OS|5.0|If you've never put any kind of film on a smooth glass surface, then your first attempt might convince you that it's impossible to do right because there always seem to be bubbles or specs of something getting in under the film--which looks ugly.  So most people don't go with a film and instead choose to protect the elegant design of the good people at Apple with some kind of case which is ugly and doubles or triples the size.<br /><br />Sure, these films are a bit pricey, but when you get one of them on properly you will more than likely never have to replace it, and it will protect your valuable device without covering up its beautiful design features.<br /><br />1st attempt: I had specs of 'stuff' under the film along with quite a few air bubbles that were impossible to push out.  I tried fixing it by removing, cleaning, and replacing the film, but it was really a futile effort and I ended up throwing the first film away.<br /><br />2nd attempt: I washed my hands and rinsed them thoroughly, cleaned the device with eyeglass cleaner and a lint free microfiber cloth, and even avoided exhaling during 'the operation' and this resulted in no specs, but I still had a couple of air bubbles and one spot where I put a small crease in the film somehow, neither of which could be fixed ultimately--so I threw away the second film as well after about a month of attempting to remove it and replace it correctly.<br /><br />3rd attempt: Cleaned up just like the 2nd attempt, only this time I put it on in one shot by starting with the end that has the hole for the menu button, lining it up with the edge of the screen, and carefully rolling it onto the surface.  No bubbles or creases, no specs, and it lined up rather well.<br /><br />So now that third anti-glare film has been on there a year and still looks perfect.<br /><br />The film itself is extremely scratch resistant,<br /><br />The anti-glare function really works without imparing the clarity of the screen while watching videos;<br /><br />I doubt it will ever need to be replaced.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />You only need one film, but it's good to have three in case your first two attempts don't go very well.<br /><br />The film functions better than expected both at protecting the screen from scratches and as an anti-glare coating; and<br /><br />It maintains the elegant design of the device in a way that encasing it in a shell or skin never can--because I didn't pay $300 or more for something nice only to enclose it completely in a $20 cheap piece of rubber or plastic.BOTTOM LINE:     You only need one film, but it's good to have three in case your first two attempts don't go very well.    The film functions better than expected both at protecting the screen from scratches and as an anti-glare coating; and    It maintains the elegant design of the device in a way that encasing it in a shell or skin never can--because I didn't pay $300 or more for something nice only to enclose it completely in a $20 cheap piece of rubber or plastic.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I rarely buy music anymore. This one is worth every penny. Nas has insane talent, but seriously fell off after Illmatic. He's had occassional hits here and there, but no truly solid albums. Damien Marley's last album was fairly solid throughout, but not to the same level as Illmatic (arguably one of the best hip-hop albums of all time).    I was surprised and VERY happy upon first listening to this album. The mix of dancehall/roots/hiphop is seamless. I was skeptical whether their two styles could mesh, but this album is a huge success. Two amazing artists on an amazing collabo. This album will remain timeless for many years to come. Don't miss out on it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I thought this was a great book.  It started kind of slow and was a little confusing at first, but keep reading...it gets great.  Once I got about 25% in, I lterally could not put it down until I finished it.  I am now onto the next one and it's not disappointing either! :)
0140186409|5.0|I'm not going to provide an analysis of this novel; that's already been done well by several other Amazon customers, as well as by book reviewers around the world. All I have to say is that I'd always meant to read it but somehow never had to in school. It's the first Kindle e-book that I downloaded when I got my iPad. I read it over the span of about 3 days and can't say enough great things about it.<br /><br />Steinbeck's tale is still frighteningly relevant today, a time where they'll slash the jobs of thousands of factory workers so that top executives can get raises. The scorn and contempt that average citizens express for the \\"Okies\\" in this story is eerily reminiscent of the attitudes that many of today's more fortunate people have toward those who are forced to collect unemployment for years on end, or else settle for minimum-wage jobs that don't even come close to supporting a family.<br /><br />I'm so impressed by this book that I'm going to get my hands on as much Steinbeck work as possible.
0143116738|5.0|This book was extremely well witten.  It reinforced what I've beeen saying all along.  We as a whole are too test happy.  Not everything can or should be decided by tests. Read it - it should make you ask questions!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am a dog lover/owner, not so interested in racing. I loved the POV of this story. The dog was awesome and we all think our dogs think like people so it worked for me.   I won't spoil it for a new reader but loved the story. A good read.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Roger Ebert gave this movie two stars, but he obviously wasn't paying attention from the get-go.  For example, he indicates that it's scientifically \\"unlikely from a Darwinian point of view that two human species should evolve independently  and contemporaneously on separate worlds.  Even more so that they would share common sexual feelings and be able to mate. . . .\\"  After the main character, Kainan (played by Jim Caviezel), crashes on earth at the beginning of the movie, he asks his portable computer where he is.  It responds with \\"Abandoned seed colony.\\"  So, obviously, Kainan and the people of earth have the same origin, i.e. Kainan's people got earth going a while back, abandoned the project and no one on earth knows about it.  It's called panspermia.<br /><br />All that being said, the film is an interesting take on the Beowulf legend that explains how such a creature could have suddenly \\"popped up\\" in Viking culture.  In the movie, the Grendel analog is known as the Moorwen, but it's much quicker and more powerful than anything in the Beowulf poem, making its eradication more of a group effort.<br /><br />All the actors do a fine job in this one, from Caviezel to John Hurt to Ron Perlman to Jack Huston.  While this won't win any awards for cinematic depth, the movie is fun, well-made and should be enjoyed by most any fan of Viking culture and/or sci-fi horror.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Rarely have I seen a film more brilliantly executed. It was gripping, fascinating, sad and beautiful. Tom Ford is an incredible director. I loved the way he made small gestures convey so many feelings, thoughts and action. I think Will Firth deserved an Oscar for this and was robbed of it. Christopher Isherwood was incredible to watch, he did not appear a lot in the movie but his time onscreen packed a strong punch. It's a movie that will stay with you for a long, long time.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I know that when a book is turned into a movie you have to expect some changes.  The changes in this movie are almost unforgivable!    **Some spoilers to follow so don't read if you don't want to hear about the movie**    My first huge gripe came up about 5 minutes in to the movie.  Who is this kid?  It can't be Percy because Percy is only 12 years old.  But of course, it was Percy.  The rest of the characters were totally miscast as well.  In the book, Grover is kind of shy and comes off a bit as a nerd.  Not the cool guy that's portrayed in this movie.  The same thing with Annabeth.  Where's the brainy cute BLOND?  Not the a** kicking brunette with the bad attitude.    Next thing that irritated me to death was the adventure to the Underworld AKA Los Angeles.  Where was the stop in St Louis?  And when in the books did they go to the park that had the Parthenon replica?  Where was the waterpark stop?      My biggest disappointment was that Chris Columbus directed this horrid movie.  I had such high expectations since he did the first Harry Potter movie and it was spot on!    I'm not sure what to say next.  Do I hope the next movie is made?  I'm kind of undecided.  That was my 2nd favorite book in the series.  Part of me does, part of me doesn't want the disappointment if it sucks.

B002GJT4XW|5.0|Just to inform you this is a review of both of the Harry Potter Ultimate Editions that have been released so far.    As I mentioned before, these new releases of the Harry Potter film franchise has been spectacular so far! Individually I love each of the first two movies. The first 2 happen to be my all-time favorites from the franchise so far (Year 1 is the best in my opinion). I got both Ultimate Editions on blu-ray even though I already owned the first dvd releases of the movies. However, my parents gave me both versions of the films in the full-screen format. So, not only did I want to rectify this error, I also wanted them to be in a higher quality. I plan to do the same for the next six Ultimate Editions.    I was astounded by the improved quality of the movies in their Blu-ray format and I enjoyed the extended versions that are also included in this set. But the thing that really sold the Ultimate Editions were the Special Features! The \\"Creating the World of Harry Potter\\" documentaries are brilliant. Each of them are over an hour long and give in-depth details about specific aspects of the films (how the film started, how the characters were adapted and cast), the next two Ultimate Editions will deal with creating the creatures and the music. The best part about these documentaries is that they deal with the characters, creatures, etc from films 1-6. Also included are all the special features from the original DVD releases. Also included in the sets is a fourth disk containing a digital copy of the film.    The only flaws with these editions are the character cards and the booklets. Usually when I get these type of releases with the booklets (which I enjoy looking at) I feel like they are putting them in there to raise the price a bit. However, it is still a good deal at $10 a disk and I plan to get the rest as I mentioned earlier.    I said to myself I would not get Goblet of Fire-Blood Prince, because I did not enjoy those movies enough to spend the moneyon the dvds. But these Ultimate Editions have gotten me to overlook this promise. I look forward to the next releases and hope they do not release them a year apart the way I think they might.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|This delightful, wonderful bit of Beemer Rock will melt the hearts of most of us over 45 types, comprised of two of out countries finest singer songwriters playing live with a legendary band. Both James Taylor and Carole King have written enough songs that they could have dome a triple album and still left songs off; and yet \\"Live at The Troubadour\\" still feels warm and fuzzy.<br /><br />Taylor only pulls a couple of oddities out (\\"Machine Gun Kelly\\" and \\"Blossom\\") while King stays strictly with the chestnuts. Taylor's voice has maintained his whiskey smoothness, King's has developed a husky rasp. They still sound fine, and when they harmonize together on \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\\" it could just give you goosebumps. And let's face it, these are soft rock classics and American Standards; \\"Up One The Roof,\\" \\"It's Too Late,\\" \\"You've Got a Friend,\\" \\"Country Road,\\" \\"Fire And Rain\\" et al. The duo do very little re-imagining of their hits, so they fit to the ears like a comfortable old hat.<br /><br />The band is terrific, too. If the names Lee Sklar (bass), Russ Kunkle (drums) and Danny Kortchmar (guitar) ring any bells, it's because just about every Cali-Rock album though the early 70's on had their playing. They have only gotten clearer and cleaner with time, and the recording is well honed by their considerable skills (although there's too much high end in this CD for my tastes). Despite that, \\"Live At The Troubadour\\" is one of the most enjoyably pleasant CD's I've bought this year.
1881273156|5.0|This is the fourth time I have bought this book.  I was giving this book by a friend 4 years ago when my marriage was in a rocky period.  Now I have giving this book to 6 different (sets) of friends, needed another one recently and all the others are either out on loan or forwarded onto others who enjoy it.  Helped a great deal for myself, knowing myself, my other as well as many people I deal with, the concepts work everywhere.  Highly recommend.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|great movie  shows the affects of how many addictions can drive us crazy if we let our lives become unmanageable
B002ZG98J6|1.0|Okay. So I rarely will spend the time to write a review for any item unless it is absolutely the greatest or worst thing I have ever purchased. This Blu-Ray, is by far the worst. I used to think the Blair Witch project was the worst. Nope. This movie wins that award. After reading the entire Percy Jackson series, I was very hopeful for this movie to be something similar to the books. Again, I was wrong. Chris Columbus is by far the worst director in Hollywood. I really pray that he is never handed millions of dollars again to ruin more book to movie crossover as he has the Harry Potter series as well.
0194799026|5.0|All the books i buy from Amazon are excellent. They come in good condition, and trust me, you would never regret. Even the used books are just new.
B00000JPYD|5.0|This is one of my favorite artists. The additional live performance tracks are also very good. Robin Trower at the height of his powers. If you like classic rock and guitar rock, you will love this!

0545123275|2.0|Shiver had a few things going for it. A new way of looking at the now tired cliche of werewolves, but this tiny flame of opportunity quickly flickered out for me. This book is essentially Twilight with werewolves. Now, if you utterly adored Twilight, excellent, this book is for you! But I found the characters a little hollow and uncompelling, the romance was held back \\"I'll sleep in your room but we won't touch\\" (cough Twilight cough). I thought the author did create a relationship but it just wasn't a relationship I could care about. Honestly, I read the book a week ago, and I've nearly forgotten the entire thing.   I'd say, idea wise, a valiant effort, but substance wise, lacking.
0679805273|5.0|I have given copies of this book to several high school graduates over the years.  This time I gave it to my niece who will be attending Texas Tech in the fall.  She absolutely loves it and says it will stay on her desk to remind he of the future.

B002VPE1OS|4.0|Overall these protectors work great and are a good quality.  The instructions were adequate and I found it very easy to install.  The only limitation is that it works only fair in the sunlight.  I hoped it would be a lot better but it is satisfactory and the protection is great.  Worth it for the quality protection provided.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|Shutter Island is a fantastic movie! Leo did a wonderful job of playing a man who is deeply troubled by the loss of his late love. His performance draws you into the essence of the entire film. Packed with suspense, it is a good selection for those who want a movie that will get their brain pumping.
031606792X|3.0|My biggest complaint is of Bella.  The girl has no life outside of Edward and I really don't get why Edward would like her in the first place. She doesn't seem like she is really in love with Edward, it just look like she has some kind of obnoxious obsessive infatuation with him. I just can't stand her. She also picks these names for possible baby names: Edward Jacob or Renesseme which are both awkwardly blended and very cheesy names. That and having Jacob imprinted(betrothed) to a baby? What the heck......it just seems wrong.<br /><br />I didn't totally hate it. Despite the fact that t wasn't written very well, something else grabbed me. Maybe its because they are all \\"young\\" and hot vampires. Who knows...<br /><br />I guess I would recommend for people to read it. Especially if you can read past a whole bunch of bad one liners!<br /><br />(Movies are better, and I must saw Jasper is a hottie!)
B000002AH7|1.0|I have 6 Miles Davis albums, one of which is a 4 set compilation.  This one is just plain lame.  It is a real snoozefest and thus far is really the only bad CD of Miles that I have come across.  I personally would recommend \\"In a Silent Way\\" if you don't have that one.  This one just drones on and on. I can't even use it for background music.
B00000JT9E|5.0|I didn't even know this was out until i heard news about the dvd's release date.  Slayer playing live on their \\"Divine Intervention\\" tour is perfect since i love that album.

The dvd comes out in a month or two and its only $10 on amazon.  Support your Slayer!
0596804822|2.0|This book has tons of examples that compile and run beautifully...save one KEY factor...the author appears to know very little about programming in Objective-C and writes nearly ALL THE EXAMPLES in pure C++. So unless you're planning on writing all your code in the verbose C++ and ignore the 22 years of smalltalk crafted benefits of Objective-C, this book isn't for you. In addition to writing nearly 98% of all the code in C++, he leans heavily on Python to smith font classes into bit arrays of glyph data; so yeah, it works, but my god, if O'Reilly were forced to name the book based on its contents, it would be called \\"How to avoid modern technology using C++ Python on the iPhone.\\" I'm really surprised he missed the opportunity to show us how CS5 could compile an iPhone binary.     Bottom line, if you know Objective-C fluently, and you're just looking for good 3D examples that you'll have to cut and paste into your existing iPhone project, this is probably for you. If you're looking to learn how to program on the iPhone in 3D, let me suggest Beginning iPhone Game Development...the book with the avocado on the front.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite female stars, so it was no surprise that she gave a fine performance as Margaret in [[ASIN:B002K0WBXW The Proposal (Single Disc Widescreen)]]. She's a lovely, likable person in real life and was perfect casting for this role of a New York editor who blackmails her assistant (Andrew, played by Ryan Reynolds) into proposing to her so she can avoid deportation to Canada. Turn-about being fair play, he then blackmails her for a promotion. Although she's a workaholic and a demanding boss, she's really a sweet, mixed-up young woman; blackmail is out of character for her, but she's desperate...<br /><br />When Andrew takes her to his parent's mansion in Alaska to meet them, they're surprised when he announces they're getting married. The trip is a ruse to convince the deportation officer of the sincerity of the engagement.<br /><br />The women in the family (mother, played by Mary Steenburgen, and grandmother, Betty White) treat Margaret with utmost respect and learn to love her. Having never enjoyed life with a close-knit family, Margaret develops strong feelings for them. And in the course of staying in their home, she learns what a great guy Andrew really is.<br /><br />Predictably, Margaret and Andrew develop feelings for each other, yet neither will admit it, preferring to spar instead. The family dog causes most of the hilarious scenes between the couple, not to mention Andrew's lovable grandmother. (Who doesn't love the irrepressible Betty White, still a scene-stealer at 87?)<br /><br />The only hold-out is Andrew's father who is disappointed in his son for not following in his footsteps; he tries to thwart their plans by conniving with the deportation officer.<br /><br />This romantic comedy has several unexpected twists and turns, and you'll never believe what happens on the day of the wedding! But Betty White saves the day by pulling some high-jinx of her own.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Comedy + Drama + Sandra Bullock = Feel-good movie!

B0035F0MTG|2.0|OK.  Let's get this out of the way.  I recently deleted a review I had written that drew a large amount of discussion, most of it incendiary and divisive before later becoming conciliatory.  The review was inspired because I was cited in an article as a contrasting opinion to Yuja Wang's justification for recording the Brahms Paganini Variations the way that she did.  At the time I was cited, I wasn't even really aware of this recording, and only listened to it afterward.  I was so angry that I posted my displeasure with this artistic choice in several locations, including the amazon review in question, using admittedly vitriolic language and loaded phrases such as \\"presuming to know more than the composer,\\" \\"butchery,\\" etc., etc.  This drew out defenders of Ms. Wang who felt that I was being far too harsh.  And maybe they were right.  I also happen to know for certain that Ms. Wang is very aware of the opinions that I have expressed.  I may have presented them in a less than diplomatic way (to understate it grossly), but unfortunately, she chose to respond to me with a typical performer's copout: \\"Thanks for your opinion, I'd love to hear you play it someday.\\"  In other words, I can play it and you can't, so your opinion doesn't matter.  Neener Neener.  But I was past that long ago.  I was far more harsh on her than was warranted.  And the point of a review is to give consumers information about a product, about a performance, about a recording.  So I want to now restate my opinion of this Brahms recording in a way that will hopefully generate a rational discussion rather than name-calling and self-righteous heel-digging, either from me or from anybody who cares to respond.  So here goes:<br /><br />I do not like the fact that Yuja Wang felt it necessary to rearrange the Paganini Variations to combine both books into one, deleting one of the finales and also moving around several variations.  I do not like her explanation for doing so, inventing a \\"problem\\" that simply doesn't exist.  I do not like the fact that the recording is marketed as the \\"Brahms Paganini Variations\\" rather than \\"Brahms Paganini Variations arranged by Arturo Michelangeli.\\"  If she is concerned about the work sounding like a series of technical exercises, then she is saying that Brahms did a bad job of assembling it.  The two-book structure is actually quite logical and well-organized, and each book builds steadily to its Finale.  Why 26 variations plus a Finale is less of a \\"series of exercises\\" than 14 variations plus a Finale is a \\"series of variations\\" is truly beyond me.  The fact is that she and Michelangeli are essentially telling Brahms that \\"my ideas are better than yours.\\"<br /><br />Brahms isn't here to express his opinion on the matter one way or another.  We know that he tolerated Clara Schumann's various experiments when performing the variations.  We also know that he was unambiguous in his publication of the work.  The 28 variations were released in two volumes of 14, each book with an extended Finale.  The two books are actually treated as two separate works: Op. 35, Nos. 1 and 2, just like the two String Quartets, Op. 51, Nos. 1 and 2 or the two clarinet/viola sonatas, Op. 120, Nos. 1 and 2.  In the old complete edition published by Breitkopf & Härtel, the two books are even given separate plate numbers.  You'll only find that situation with the two aforementioned opus numbers, along with Op. 93, a clear instance of \\"93a\\" and \\"93b\\" being not only separate works, but quite unrelated.  The song sets are given single plate numbers, even though complete performances of an opus numbered group of songs are rare.  For me, that's a powerful argument.  You can perform one of the books and call it a \\"complete performance\\" of that book.  You can perform both of the books separately, playing the theme before each one, retaining each finale.  Whatever.  But what I don't think you really can do is decide that for no apparent reason, the two books absolutely MUST be combined and that a solution MUST be found for this \\"problem,\\" as Ms. Wang very much seems to imply in her statements about the recording.<br /><br />What you are doing at that point is performing an arrangement.  In this case, Ms. Wang felt like paying tribute to Arturo Michelangeli by performing his--arrangement of the Brahms Paganini Variations.  The real \\"problem\\" here is that DG didn't market it as an arrangement.  Ms. Wang can perform the piece (or pieces, as it were) any way she sees fit, but this isn't a live performance.  This is a recording.  People buy recordings to add to collections, to have a certain piece of music in those collections.  Somebody who didn't know any better might see this CD, recognize Ms. Wang's name from her accolades as the brightest new star in the piano world, and decide to buy it, thinking that he or she might be getting a complete performance of the Paganini Variations by this artist.  The track listing is a bit of a clue that there's more to the story, but it's not explicit.<br /><br />So this person might sit down with the score and, lo and behold, it's not all there!  It's not in the right order!  Wait, I didn't know that I wasn't getting it all!  And why is everything shifted around?  It looks to me like the composer had a clear and symmetrical plan with the two books!  What gives?<br /><br />The answer to the marketing question, of course, is that \\"arranged by...\\" is a little off-putting, so DG chose not to include it.  Some may argue that it's not an arrangement, that no actual musical substance has been changed.  I beg to differ.  Whenever you can't follow a score straight through with a recording, not knowing in advance what changes may have been made, we are dealing with an arrangement.  Yes, I suppose you could argue that, with those criteria, something like an omitted exposition repeat would then qualify as an \\"arrangement.\\"  But we're dealing with a little more than an omitted exposition repeat here.So did the consumer get ripped off?  If they thought they were buying the complete Brahms Paganini Variations (which the packaging gives them no reason to doubt) then they certainly did.<br /><br />There are certainly other arguments against Ms. Wang's decision.  Brahms carefully held back a new tonal center, F major, until almost the last variation of the second book.  It's a striking moment, giving a clear indication that the end is coming.  If extra variations, moved from their proper order, are placed after this one (as is done here), and the Finale from the other book replaces the one that is supposed to follow here, the composer's carefully planned effect is disrupted.  That certainly falls in the realm of \\"arrangement,\\" not simply \\"performance.\\"  Never mind that Ms. Wang's \\"problem\\" is entirely dubious--Mr. Michelangeli's approach to solving this \\"problem\\" is musically suspect in many ways that do not respect the composer's intentions.<br /><br />That's really all I have to say now.  I'm going to include my credentials and real name, not to brag about them, but because somebody is inevitably going to respond with hostility, calling me a self-righteous idiot, telling me that Brahms doesn't need me to defend him, citing Richard Taruskin, explaining that being a purist keeps your mind closed, etc. (and if you are that person, and you know who you are, I'm being tongue-in-cheek here, not attacking you, and I hope you can see the humor in it).  The fact is that I'm very open-minded and always look for interesting nuances in performances.  I just have a certain pet peeve when somebody decides, for no good reason, to mess around with a piece that's perfectly fine just the way it is and really can't be improved upon because the composer did a pretty good job with it already.  If there's a compelling reason, fine.  I'm sure Bach had compelling reasons for arranging Vivaldi Concertos.  Goodness, Brahms himself arranged the Bach Chaconne for piano left hand.  But I donot find Ms. Wang's reason for adopting the Michelangeli version very compelling.  I find it unnecessary.  I can't wrap my head around a \\"problem\\" that I just cannot perceive.  And I really can't forgive Ms. Wang and DG for not marketing this recording for what it is--an ARRANGEMENT, ABRIDGEMENT, and SPLICING of the two books of Brahms Paganini Variations.<br /><br />Kelly Dean Hansen, Ph.D. Musicology<br />Classical Music Writer, Boulder Daily Camera<br />[...]<br />[...]
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I am so pleased with the Leonard Cohen double CD. Having seen the performance on PBS I just had to have the CDs. Having the CDs make it easy to put them on my computer, play on my portable and on my standard player.  Everyone should have this Live in London CD.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I put this just behind DSOFTM and WYWH. Does is sound like a typical Floyd album? Heck no. Is it a great piece of work? Hell yes! Forget about the \\"Pink Floyd sound\\" for a an hour and allow yourself to be absorbed. Waters speaks (sings, writes) from the heart here, and the lyrics and melodies are pure and eloquent. I've always approached PF albums as a journey, and The Final Cut is no exception. The mood is dark and introspective. The feelings are real. Granted this album only sold 700,000 copies and Waters was clearly disappointed, yet it's a masterpiece (Kurt Loeder agrees). Waters once said that while shopping a woman approached him and told him the album moved her to tears, and he thought, \\"Well that's good enough, then.\\" Waters wasn't always looking to create chartable hits, he wanted to affect you, to move you, and he succeeds with this album. So if you have listened to this album one time and dismissed it, I urge you, give it another listen.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|I'm not going to add any new comment about the quality/not quality of the film. To me it's one of the most fun, campy and enjoyable superhero films EVER! That's probably the reason why seems so difficult to do a proper or decent remake.    The blu ray print it's absolutely flawless. Magnificently sharp and with vibrant colors. No grain at all! The reds, yellows and greens are unbelivable! One of the best Universal blu ray titles I have bought. The Dts sound it's also great, and the Queen music sounds better than ever! 5 stars for a great blu ray of a modern classic.    I will love to add to my collection a similar copy of Ridley Scott's Ultimate edition of Legend. Please Universal...!!!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|For me this was like watching a private concert. Micheal was a pure genius in all avenues of music. I watched his moves and thought to myself how could he still move like that after all the years that had passed. Every thing he did in this was awesome. I, like so many others wish that we could have gotten a chance to see him perform just one more time. He was and will always be tbe greatest entertainer to ever live. All you have to do is look at this DVD. Once you get started you are not going to want to move until it is over. Love you forever, Mike. There will never be another you.
B002P6TA94|5.0|And what a way to close out the first ten years. At first I hated Wolfmother. I bought their first album on a whim after watching a video and for the first several times I listened to it I cringed. It did sound like rehashed music. But I truly wasn't getting it. This wasn't a band trying to sound like a band from the 70's, this is probably the only band that comes closest to sounding like the genuine article, like a band that could have legitmately come from the era.   Ok, look at it this way, if you like that sound, and you want something NEW to listen to, this is about the best game in town. I started just giving the album a chance (the one previous to Cosmic Egg, \\"Wolfmother\\"), and I really came to like the raw vocals and rowdy bawdy troublemaker lyrics and delivery as well as the fantastic guitar work and songwriting. Great stuff.  So finally broke down and bought Cosmic Egg Deluxe edition. People, you [i]need[/i] the extra songs on the deluxe version; it really is like having a double album, the second disc is legit, pretty much a full length standalone album on that stands on its own. Great songs on there too. All of them.  In fact, both discs on Cosmic Egg Deluxe edition are incredibly addictive and replayable. The sound production is just beyond amazing, and Stockdale is a [i]hell[/i] of a songwriter, [i]and[/i] lead guitarist. He's plays a variety of vibro-bladed styles, and even enters metal territory on some tracks, just heavy stuff. Fun, aggressive, raw, bold. Like a great 70's rock band.  What's not to love? Crank it. Five stars. I simply cannot wait for the follow up to this, I will preorder for sure.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|I thought Keane will reach greatness ala Coldplay or Radiohead after two albums but they instead fell into a pit.  This is their worst work to date.  Nothing worth listening to or even any standout single in this crap.  Save your money.  If you must buy one Keane CD, get the 1st one (Hopes and Fears) which I think is a classic.  Every song is worth listening to.
B002ZG997M|5.0|Book of Eli is a wonderful movie about the world in dark times.  Denzel Washington does a wonderful portrayal of his character Eli on a quest to deliver a book.  Gary Oldman plays Carnegie, a big boss of small town searching for a special book to control the people, one particular book.  Guess who has the one he is looking for.<br /><br />If you look at the ratings for this movie currently they are 50% for 5 Stars and rest are evenly spread out over 1 - 4 stars.  That says something.  This movie makes you think and not just sit on your couch.  There are some people that get the complete story and there are some that don't.  If you get it you apparently are one of us with Faith (Eli, Solara, Claudia and possibly Redridge) and if you don't get it maybe your without Faith (Carnegie, etc).  You're blind to what gives this movie substance.  I would have like to seen this movie have a few more action scenes or more drama at times.  But the pacing fits the landscape the story is set in (sparse and desolate).<br /><br />Guro Dan Inosanto and Jeff Imada did a great job on the fight sequences and training Denzel for his role.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />If you have not seen the movie then stop reading RIGHT NOW.  The two big surprises in the movie are the book itself and the fact that Eli is a blind man.  I have seen some on the internet state that the book was saved to just sit on a shelf.  That his quest was a waste.  If you look clearly at the scenes of the printing press you notice they are printing multiple versions of each page.  They are printing multiple copies so THE WORD can be spread.<br /><br />Looking at the movie a 2nd time take his blindness this way.  Eli was blind before his quest and when he arrived at his destination.  When Eli takes on his quest from GOD he is given sight so he can complete his task.  Proof of his \\"sight by Faith\\" would be the fact that he maneuvers in an environment without any issues.  That his eyes focus when he is talking to people.  Only on a few scenes does he use his hands to sense his environment.  In the making-of documentary on the disk the writer states that Eli is not a former soldier.  He is just someone who developed these skills to fight along the way.  A blind man would not train himself raise his pistol or shotgun to aim.  He would not be able to take out a sniper over 100 feet away on different elevation from behind him based on sound.  He would not be accurate with a bow and arrow without his sight.  He would not know the house was off to the side of the road and stay the night unless he had sight.<br /><br />When GOD gave him his mission Eli received GOD'S protection.  Proof of his protection would be Eli being shot at by Redridge in the town twice and not being hit both times.  The third time Redridge should have shot Eli, Redridge just puts his gun down and doesn't even try.  Also surviving in such a world for 30 years is yet more proof.  I would say that the only time Eli did not have his protection or sight would be when Carnegie shoots him.  GOD wanted him to give over the book and possibly test Eli at the same time.is talking to people.  Only on a few scenes does he use his hands to sense his environment.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I read all the reviews before purchasing this movie.  Just reading the reviews, I cried, so I knew when I watched it, I would probably bawl the whole way through.  Well, the tears didn't start until about a little past halfway through...but when they started, I couldn't stop them.  This is the most heartfelt love story about a man and his faithful dog.  Even though I knew what was going to happen, I thought \\"I can handle it\\" and won't shed a tear.  How wrong I was.  The story and the dog just grabs your heart and doesn't let go.  Very well made and I am so happy I have it in my collection.  The commentary at the end with Richard Gere and how the movie was made is also definately worth watching...and yes, I cried again watching that!  Well, time to try and dry my tears.  At least they're happy tears.  Buy this...you won't regret it!
B002VPE1YS|3.0|What can you say about a small, padded, quilted bag with a drawstring that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />The color is the blackest black I've ever seen, resembling a fine piece of obsidian. The stitching is incredible--so uniform that it appears to have been done by a machine! And the drawstring--gently pulling on it easily closes the bag, especially thanks to the charcoal drawstring closure.<br /><br />Basic yet versatile, this little bag can conceal myriad small objects that you might want to keep out of view. Though the possibilities are nearly endless, the pouch is limited to objects that are smaller than it is, so keep that in mind when ordering.
068484267X|5.0|I recently reread this book and found myself laughing and crying as if it were the first time.  McCourt is so raw and honest, and to think he lived this!  This book remains one of my top ten favorites--it is a tragedy that leaves one so thankful for their blessings, and reaffirms that humor can carry one through the most difficult of situations.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is the original Death at a Funeral. British. I haven't seen the new American version and I don't want to... and I'm an American! This movie was sooo freakin hilarious I couldn't breath. I don't know that it's new American counterpart can live up to the expectation. It's starts off leaving you to wonder, \\"hmm... is this going to be any good?\\" but within a few minutes (once you reach the funeral), it's on! Rolling funny... definitely a bestseller!
B002VPE1XY|5.0|There are two versions of the AmazonBasics small camera case. The only difference is that the \\"HF\\" case has a short closing flap (about 1/3 the length of the case), while the this case has a full length closing flap. I found both to work about equally well.<br /><br />This case is nicely designed. The leather is soft, and the interior has a nice texture that will protect the camera. The case uses a magnetic closure that worked fine. I was pleased to find that there is an interior pouch that can be used for a spare media card, or in my case a spare Olympus battery actually fits perfectly. The belt loop has Velcro fastenings, which means it is easy to get on and off a belt or backpack. This is a nice touch - you don't have to remove the belt, but get the security of a belt loop mounting. The case expands to the front/back (although you may need to remove a floorboard, see below), so a wider camera may fit, it it isn't too deep. The expanding case adds a lot of flexibility to the range of cameras it can hold.<br /><br />There are a couple of things to be aware of with this case. First, it is quite small. Take a close look at your camera specifications and then check the page to make sure it will fit. My Olympus cameras just barely fit, and they are thinner than most cameras. Second, the \\"HF\\" case came with a hard floor panel inside the case, which will need to be removed unless you like the case to be fully expanded at all times. However I did not have any trouble removing it - it just came out with a slight bit of pulling.<br /><br />Overall, this is a highly recommended design. One final thought; it might work pretty well for a cell phone case, if one doesn't need any external access to the phone (no holes for a headset).
B002VPE1OS|3.0|I got a set of the anti-glare and the regular screen savers for my Iphone 3gs.  This was my first anti-glare protector and I do like the way it reduces glare, however, like all anti-glare, it kills the brightness and crispness of the screen.  For that reason, I prefer the regular protector.    As far as other protectors, it seems to be as good as others I've used from the AT&T store as well as others I've bought from Amazon.  No matter how hard I try, I always get bubbles in my screen after a while and these are no exception.  I'll probably stick to the amazon brand but will get the regular protectors from now on.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I really enjoyed this \\"reboot\\" of the Star Trek story. Even though I don't consider myself a hard-core Star Trek fan, I was excited by the idea of seeing the early years of the Enterprise crew. Overall, I'd give the film an A- for it's solid story, great acting and special effects. I wasn't too impressed with the interior shots and set of the engine room/lower levels of the Enterprise, as it's painfully obvious they were shot in a present-day industrial facility of some sort. That was the low point for me, and it stood out like a sore thumb in an otherwise well-made flick.  Also, this movie really shines when experienced on a quality big screen HDTV with (at least) a good 5.1 surround sound audio system.  Lastly, thumbs-up to Amazon for fast shipping and a great price for the three disk edition.

B002ZMZBD2|4.0|I enjoy the album as much as the next guy but I am surprised it's not mentioned in any reviews how heavily Zimmer 'borrowed' both theme and sound from Ennio Morricone's Once Upon a Time in the West score...    Check out tracks 3, 5 and 9 here:    [[ASIN:B000002W71 Once Upon A Time In The West: The Original Soundtrack Recording]]      Otherwise, it's a refreshing departure from Zimmers normal action score style.

B00008NRI8|5.0|In 28 Days Sandra Bullock has 4 weeks to get through rehab and start to be funny. Here, she only has Two Weeks Notice, but the film is twice as funny in half the time. Hugh Grant is so charming that he was able to restart his career after he was caught with his pants down with Divine Brown. He made the Mea Culpa circuit on the talk shows, admitted his mistake with a boyish grin, and all was forgiven (though he probably still had a lot of 'splaining to do to his girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley). Anyway, oftentimes when I see a Hugh Grant or a Sandra Bullock film, I am very skeptical at first. Sometimes they are a bit much. But seeing them together, I bet that they would be fantastic. Each would balance out the other, or so I hoped.<br /><br />Thankfully, I wasn't wrong. As far as the Romantic Comedy genre goes, it doesn't get any better than this. Their characters are opposites that attract, like Sam and Diane on Cheers. Hugh is a business man / Real Estate developer--kind of a Donald Trump with better hair and a British accent (BTW, Trump does a cameo and a Trump home is used for one of the locations). Grant is George Wade, a classic conservative, while Sandra plays Lucy Kelson, a liberal lawyer given to defending the poor downtrodden, and as a result, she is pretty poor and downtrodden her own self.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Meryl Brooks: Come on, I've known you since Brownies, and the only time I ever saw you cry was when Bush won.<br />Lucy Kelson: Which one?<br />Meryl Brooks: Well, both of them.<br />========================================<br /><br />George Wade hires lady lawyers strictly for their looks. His brother tells him that has got to stop:<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Howard Wade: You need someone who can write a brief instead of removing yours.<br />================================<br /><br />Seeing that Lucy is a bright lawyer, he offers her a lavish salary which she accepts. He is banking on the fact that they are really not each other's cup of tea, and so will not be distracted from the business at hand. All goes extremely well, but George begins to rely on Lucy more and more.<br /><br />------------------<br />Lucy Kelson: What did I tell you that defines an emergency?<br />George Wade: A large meteoroid, severe blood loss and uh... what was the other thing?<br />Lucy Kelson: Death! And you're not dead!<br />=============================<br /><br />It is at this juncture in time that Lucy gives George the Two Week Notice referred to in the title. She begins interviewing replacements, and none seem suitable, or even adequate, until in walks a bright young redhead fresh out of Harvard, June Carver (Alicia Witt). June moves in for the kill, and soon Lucy is feeling quite a bit jealous, realizing too late that she has fallen in love with the dashing and debonair George. June usurps her role and becomes his date for a charity function that he had originally invited Lucy to. June wears a top hat that is so Betsy's Wedding it isn't funny, or maybe it's a little funny, but it is mainly just very hot, a black top hat instead of a white one. For me, this was an unexpected treat. Alicia Witt is not only beautiful, she is smart, too.

Wow. With Alicia Witt? What could be more tantalizing than that? Don't worry; it is all very tastefully done. But wait a minute; we are supposed to be in Kelson's corner. We are rooting for Lucy, not June. So Alicia Witt plays June as just a bit of a... well, you know.<br /><br />Alicia Witt got her start in David Lynch's Dune, but I remember her as Cybill's daughter Zoey Woodbine on Cybill's sit com, Cybill. She was a smart and sassy redhead who played piano. In real life she was a classically trained pianist who used to play the piano at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She was also kind of a child prodigy. At the tender age of four she appeared on \\"That's Incredible!\\" (1980) to show off her amazing reading skills, and she also performed the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet with the host. Her mother, Diane Witt, was in the Guinness Book of World Records from 1988 to 1996 for having the world's longest hair. One wonders if it was also red, and what a splendid sight that would make. Alicia herself modeled what is purported to be the most expensive hat ever made, the $2,700,000 Chapeau d'Amour designed by Louis Mariette, at Christie's in London. Last time I saw her was as Miss Pasternak on 2 and a Half Men, where she was devastatingly cute, though her character was a little bit crazy.<br /><br />Director Marc Lawrence is an expert at crafting Rom Com vehicles for either Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. He wrote Forces of Nature and Miss Congeniality, and he wrote and directed Two Weeks Notice, Music and Lyrics, and Did You Hear About the Morgans? Since he is so adept at creating and filming material for both Grant and Bullock, you'd expect a film with the two of them together to be a slam dunk.

0553381687|5.0|DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!! It is well written, and stacks up well against Dune for craftsmanship, but when you are drawn to read the next three books in the series, you'll be disappointed to discover that you're left hanging after the fourth (A Feast for Crows). By hanging, I mean five years later and no book #5 (A Dance With Dragons). Others will tell you that the quality of the book makes the \\"years-long\\" wait worth it, and while I'll not argue the quality of the books (they are wonderful), I will say that it is unacceptable for an author to say a book is finished, and four years later we're still waiting. I'm more than willing to wait a year for a book in a series, but this is simply ridiculous. Even worse, the plan (supposedly) is for two more books in the series for a total of seven books. Judging by how long we've waited for the fifth....I don't think I'll be holding my breath!<br /><br />It's an epic tale....and an epic disappointment. DON'T START THIS SERIES IF YOU EXPECT AN ENDING!<br /><br />Disclaimer: Please ignore above comments if the next three books are published immediately!
B0025KW29U|5.0|I bought this on a whim based upon the recommendation of other Amazon customers. I was not dissappointed. What a wonderful video. The music is OUTSTANDING, you will find yourself signing or humming these tunes to yourself. The storyline is incredibly creative and entertaining. And after watching this you will be a Niel Patrick Harris fan, I had no idea he was that talented. If you like musicals at all, trust me, you will love this! Oh, and the Blu-Ray looks GREAT!
0060558121|4.0|I waited a long time to write this review, mainly because I wanted to read more of Gaiman's work before I wrote this. I read American Gods about a year ago, and I just read Gaiman's other related book, Anansi Boys, yesterday.<br /><br />Of the two novels, I enjoyed Anansi Boys more. American Gods was good, but it seemed to plod along in places. I hate spoiler reviews, but lets just say that the part where the main character is wrapped up in a tree went by very, very slowly. I just think that plot had too many threads-- it was a million minor characters and it made it hard to keep everything together.<br /><br />It's still a good book, because Gaiman is the master of creating alternate universes-- completely plausible environments that make the reader question their own reality. I love that. This is a good book, but I liked Anansi Boys even better.
0061186473|4.0|I love Gaiman's work, but I've never before picked up a book of his short stories (I'm not really partial to short stories as a whole). I did enjoy M Is for Magic, though. The stories were entertaining. They aren't for small children, since there's a little colorful language in there and some other things that are inappropriate for a very young age group. If you're reading Gaiman to your kids, though, you should be used to reading through his work beforehand, as his writing runs from children's stories up to very adult pieces.<br /><br />I'm very rarely creeped out by a story, but the short 'The Price' definitely had me thinking second thoughts about walking through dark rooms at night; it was one of those stories that makes you wonder about your pets. 'How to Talk to Girls at Parties' was very cute, up until the ending. I loved the science fiction-y, otherworldly tang to the people at the party. 'Chivalry' was a very sweet fairy tale which, if I'm remembering correctly, is suitable for any age. 'The Troll Bridge' stood out, to me, as the saddest short in the book - a cautionary tale of letting your life go unlived. And 'Instructions' was the perfect way to end the book, with a thoughtful, fantastic little poem.
B002VPE1OS|5.0|This is an excellent product to protect your iPhone screen.  It's already custom fitted to it the iPhone so the cutouts are in perfect position.  It may be a little tricky to install, but it's not that bad.  There are 2 protective films.  You remove 1 film and install the product - then you remove the second film. This protects the front and the back of the product.  It's really not that hard.  The hardest part is to make sure there is absolutely not even 1 speck of dust on your screen or the film.  1 speck of dust will result in a little bubble that cannot be pressed out because the dust will \\"tent\\" up the film.  When I installed this product, I had 2 specks of dust and no air bubbles.  I could live with that.  Once installed, it does an excellent job in protecting the screen.  I would definitely recommend this product!

Intriguing and well written.
B00006AW2G|5.0|First things first:  the great majority of 1-star reviews here seem centered around the fact that some peeps are unfortunately having issues putting this disc on their computer to download to mp3 and import to their portable mp3 player.  I had no such problem at all nor have most reviewers here, so I think these folks need a new computer or perhaps a little help using it.  Either way, I think we can easily disregard over half of the 1-star reviews since they aren't commenting on the MUSIC here.<br /><br />So discounting that issue, we have 180+ 4 or 5-star reviews (so far) and maybe 15 or so that rate it as 1, 2 or 3-stars.  The majority of course isn't always right, but in this case, they ARE.  Simply put, everyone has their opinion of what the \\"best\\" Stones album is, but for anyone who's heard it all, this album absolutely has to at least be on the short list of titles that can realistically be nominated for Best Stones Album Ever.  I personally have it at #2 behind \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and 1 spot ahead of \\"Tattoo You,\\" with \\"Some Girls\\" at #4.<br /><br />This is of course the 2nd of 4 consecutive albums generally considered to be among the very best the Stones ever delivered, starting with \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" (1968), followed by \\"Let It Bleed,\\" then 1971's \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and then the much (over)-hyped \\"Exile On Main Street\\".  Personally, I find Sticky Fingers and Let It Bleed the best of these 4 classic Stones albums, but everyone has their own opinion.  Forget the comparisons though and just look at what's here:  classic cuts even non-Stones fans will have heard (and most likely enjoyed) include \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" \\"Monkey Man,\\" as well as the title cut.  That's half the album that has featured prominently on rock radio for 40+ years now!<br /><br />And these songs are surely the strength of the album, but the rest of the less popular cuts are what propels this release to the ranks of \\"undeniable classic\\":  the superb take on blues-master Robert Johnson's \\"Love In Vain\\" is Mick and Co. at their bluesy best.  \\"Country Honk\\" is a country-fied version of the better-known \\"Honkey Tonk Women,\\" and while I might agree with Stones label-heads who were disappointed that this version was selected for inclusion on the album instead of the single version, we are fortunate in that we don't have to choose:  the more popular single version is available on multiple compilations (\\"Hot Rocks,\\" \\"40 Licks,\\" etc.) and the country version here is an interesting display of how country the roots of the Stones could truly be while still delivering the overall sound and attitude that made them famous to begin with.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Live With Me\\" which kicks off with a driving Bill Wyman bass-line and Charlie Watts thumping a straight and solid beat that propels the hardest rocking song of this album (which also features outstanding sax by Bobby Keys and piano by studio legend Nicky Hopkins).  The excellent sound quality makes it sound like this was recorded in 2009, not 1969.<br /><br />My perhaps favorite cut is next, the title cut, \\"Let It Bleed\\".  I knew the song, but I didn't know the title until I bought this album and I was truly thrilled to have found this song as it's a gem!  It could almost be a Grateful Dead song, but the Stones make it sound better than the Dead ever could.  \\"We all need someone to lean on, and if you want to, you can lean on me...\\".  Not sure if that's \\"rock,\\" \\"blues\\" or \\"country\\", but I like it.  Superb.<br /><br />Also included is \\"Midnight Rambler,\\" but buyer beware:  this is the studio version, not the more popular live version lifted from \\"Get Your Ya-Ya's Out!\\" and featured on \\"Hot Rocks\\".  A great song is a great song and this is definitely a solid track, but to me the definitive version of this song is the live version.  Hard to call this studio version a \\"disappointment\\" though.<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest cut (imo) is \\"You Got The Silver,\\" the first song in the Stonescatalog to feature Keith Richards on lead vocals.  Which is not to say it's a bad cut, but it is the weakest track on an otherwise flawless album.<br /><br />All told, 9 cuts, 4 that almost everyone will know, 4 more that are every bit as good as \\"the hits\\" and the one so-so track by Richards.  The sum total is an album you can listen to from start to finish time and time again without getting tired of it (and boy are THOSE hard to find these days...).<br /><br />Some earlier reviewers have argued over who the driving force of this album is since this came out when the role of Brian Jones was dwindling but before Mick Taylor was on as a full-time member.  The credits show that Jones played on only two tracks (and not even guitar at that...) and Mick Taylor played on only two as well, so I think it's obvious that the driving force of this album is the same as most Stones classics:  the songwriting of Mick and Keef, the solid rhythms of Bill and Charlie and the guitar of Keith Richards and whoever else was around!  Brian Jones certainly deserves credit for his early role in shaping what the Stones would become, but the majority of their best work was done without him and Mick Taylor certainly wasn't around long enough to put his stamp on this one.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you don't have this and are even slightly intrigued with the possibility of checking it out, BUY IT.  Maybe \\"Sticky Fingers\\" or another title or two the Stones did at some point is better, but if they ever did a better album than \\"Let It Bleed,\\" it wasn't by MUCH.
030745455X|5.0|The huge number of readers who enjoyed Larsson's first book The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will be thrilled with this one, for the drama and suspense are even better. The main characters are the same with the same interesting idiosyncrasies. The book has the same problems - it is difficult to identify and distinguish the Swedish people's names and the places because they all sound the same - but this does not distract from enjoying the novel.<br /><br /> Larsson or his translator has an effective writing style that heightens suspense. He speaks, for example, about a male and then virtually all of his sentences begin with he. He frequently places the pronoun in the middle of a sentence where he is not the first word. He does the same with she for females. He uses this active near staccato style to enhance the action and our interest.<br /><br /> Blomkvist and his publishing firm plan to publish an expose involving, among others, police and politicians. Three people are killed. Neither the police nor Blomkvist, who is as persistent and naïve as he was in the first book, or Lisbeth Salander, who is even more intense than in the first book, and who is the principle character of this novel, can figure out why the people were killed. They do not know if it is related to the planned expose, perhaps an attempt to stop it. However, is it related to Lisbeth Salander's past?<br /><br /> The novel reveals more interesting information about Lisbeth, what caused her to be what she is and act as she does. She becomes the prime suspect in the murders and Blomkvist and other friends of Lisbeth determine that they will do all in their power to prove her innocence. We readers are told many facts that the police do not know, but not the identity of the killer or the motive, and it is interesting to read how the police misconstrue the facts, draw wrong conclusions, and act inappropriately.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Nearly thirty years ago I fell in love with Rush at first listen when I was twelve and heard those powerful opening strains of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" (so Rush is not just a guys' band, as any viewing of \\"Rush in Rio\\" could have told you anyway).  That song, and the corpus of Rush's work generally, resonated with me (as clearly it has with millions of fans for decades) and seemed to open up a universe of possibility--well, perhaps it rather inspired me to explore a universe of possibility.  This documentary captures that sense of inspiration, especially with those wonderful interviews with other musicians awed and inspired by Rush.  Particularly moving and telling was Billy Corgan's recounting how, when he was sixteen, he asked his mother to listen to \\"Entre Nous\\" with him.  Now how many teenagers would be inspired to do something like that, to seek connection with a parent because a song spoke to his alienation?  And it was Rush who helped to make that possible--amazing!    This documentary helps to articulate something that the so-called music critics almost universally overlooked, namely, that Rush's deeply intelligent and emotionally mature lyrics that explore the wide range of human experience--paired with their superb musical craftsmanship--speak directly to the best in everyday people.  Whether you are a plumber, a philosopher, a nurse, or a parent, there is something about Rush that touches you. Sure, one's understanding of \\"Bastille Day\\" or \\"Red Sector A\\" would be augmented by an understanding of French history and World War II, respectively, but the general themes of rebellion against tyranny and injustice are widely shared beyond specific historical events.  Newer songs such as \\"Ghost Rider\\" and \\"Secret Touch\\" will reduce anyone to tears who has experienced loss.  And classics such as \\"The Trees,\\" \\"Free Will,\\" \\"Spirit of Radio,\\" \\"Subdivisions\\" .... simply brilliant and insightful without being condescending.  This is part of what makes Rush so unique and accessible--they don't try to be clever; they're genuine, sincere, and \\"fearless\\" (in the apt word used by one of the interviewed musicians).  So, thank you, Rush, for being who you are and for offering your fans this overarching look at your career thus far....
0307474712|5.0|The minute I started this book I knew it would be made into a movie... it flowed perfectly and I didn't want to put it down.  A lovely book... quite British-- but don't let that deter you (if you are from the US!).  As a 45 year old woman with a lifetime of relationships (good and bad), I could relate to much of the sentiments portrayed by Emma-- and was intrigued by Dex's perspective as well... Mr. Nicholls has portrayed a realistic friendship and more in his book... and it was quite lovely to read.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I haven't laughed so hard at a movie ... in a very long time.  And i don't like British humor! I was laughing so hard at the Uncle-Alfie-goes-to-the-bathroom scene, I couldn't even see - couldn't get my eyes open! Made 3 attempts to view that particular scene, think I finally caught most of it ... my sides and face hurt! You may need to keep the sound up, to hear and make out what those Brits are saying, but this was a very funny movie.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|People, this is not difficult. For five-plus incredible seasons LOST was plot driven, not character driven (that is not to say there wasn't any character development; LOST had probably the best character development of any television show I have ever seen). The story arc was a fantastic blend of adventure, mystery, science fiction, and the supernatural. All of the key plot points and devices drove the ultimate resolution of the story the writers had devised for our entertainment. Then along came the final episodes of Season 6...<br /><br />It beggars belief that Amazon and the web are awash with supercilious reviews scoffing at the notion that the writers had a duty to provide their audience with \\"answers\\" and intellectualizing about how poignant and fitting and beautiful the ending was and how those who disagree \\"don't get it.\\" Such sentiments could only come from those who didn't watch every episode from the pilot onward and simply don't understand the concept of the story arc in episodic storytelling. Those of us who did, and do, could never accept the axiom that it is the audience's responsibility to \\"interpret\\" the outcome.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of LOST, but ultimately, the destination had to make sense within the story arc developed over the preceeding five seasons. That the writers/producers instead gave us a hackneyed ending more befitting of some Hallmark Channel melodrama revealed a contempt for their creation and audience far more baffling than any mystery on the island.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|This arrived the very same day that my iPhone 4 did and it couldn't have been better timing as I hadn't been able to find a case that I liked for the phone yet and was concerned about it being protected. This case is very durable with just the right amount of padding to ensure that your device is completely protected. It's not too bulky that it can't fit in my purse but not so flimsy that it doesn't really offer any protection at all. It finds a nice middle ground that I have really enjoyed having around. I've since used it to carry my small point and shoot camera, USB sticks, iPods, anything electronic that I can fit it in. It comfortably holds both my iPod 3G 64GB right alongside my iPhone 4, both with their own protective cases on as well. The clip has also been extremely useful as I do yoga, run and just hang around in the house in light, pocketless pants and I really want to have my music with me most of the time. This has always been kind of a sore spot for me as I love to be comfortable but I never have anywhere to put my music. I've even used fanny packs (inside the house only!) for this purpose. Not anymore! I put the clip right over the waistband on my pants and it's completely secure. It's never slipped or fallen off and even if by some chance it did, I know my phone is well protected. Overall I continue to get tons of use out of it for the fantastic low price and I can't recommend it enough.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I started watching this series thinking it was just one more crime series. But I was pleasantly surprised. In addition to being a very well-crafted series, it's also full of humor, which is pretty rare for this kind of shows. It goes from humour, tensions, mysteries, and even sadness at times. The actors are all well chosen (especially Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic). Very good chemistry between the two main characters. The idea of involving a novelist in murder investigations gives an interesting result, from which follow most of the funny scenes. The dialogues are not neglected. Some lines are already cult! I think what I like the best is the fact that the private lives of the main characters is not put in the background. It makes for complex and interesting characters (Castle and Beckett).
0061801313|5.0|The Pretty Little Liars Series has a great story line going on! You always wonder about the box sets if you havent read the first book and not know if you will like it.

B002ZG9846|5.0|This is a Highly underated movie and destined to be a all time classic movie once people see it. More Than the unusual performance from Hit-girl, the movie sparkles in awesome music and great film editing. This was made by a movie maker with lots of heart and not a faceless corperation looking for a fast buck and it shows in everyway. I cannot wait for this double blu ray and to proudly place it on my mantle of other great movies! Keep a eye on this director I expect more greatness from him!!
B001NLL8LA|3.0|I have soured a bit on the Reacher series as I have read more of them (this is 13), which is why I gave it only three stars, but it's one of the best. The whole \\"suicide bomber\\" scene was instructive. I am suspicious of commercial motives when I read these days, so I wonder if the Four Seasons product placement paid off. Certainly time spent there would be a tax deduction, at the least. Speaking of commercial considerations, the subway crossing the tracks scene seemed like a movie try, let alone the knife fight. I just don't think the Reacher series reaches the levels of the Harry Bosch or Worlds Greatest Detective series.
B00275EHJG|4.0|I saw this with my kids ages 4-11, they all thought it was great.  Me, I'm a little more critical.  I found the first Toy Story movie a little dark (Sid was just creepy) and the second one a little forced and artificial.  It's unusual for the third installment to be the best, but I believe that this one was.    All the old favorite toys are back, the action is good, there are enough one-liners to keep me chuckling.  I found myself involved enough in the story to be interested in how it ends (a rare thing as I watch kids movies).  The ending had a bit of a surprise twist that in my opinion made the entire movie.    My favorite Pixar remains \\"The Incredibles\\", but this one was pretty good.  I'd watch it again.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|I liked the premise of the book very much but when the story turned to the custody battle  I just cringed.  The cliche of the plot made it impossible for me to invest myself in the struggle  and I just lost interest...it was like a bad Lifetime movie.  I truly don't understand the hype over this book.

Written on a simple, straightforward language, the book elucidates how a structured and good established way of teaching guitar makes it easier for a player to understand music through his own instrument.
B002UXRGM0|4.0|The quality of the film taken for this series is absolutely astounding.  I have never seen such amazing shots, even after having seen Planet Earth.  While the content has not gripped me nearly as well as Planet Earth, watching this series on Blu-Ray certainly makes up for the not-as-strong content.      I also highly recommend the narration by David Attenborough as opposed to Oprah Winfrey.  Oprah is a fine person, to be sure, but David Attenborough has been at this for ages, and his experience makes the commentary shine.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I don't know how to start this review.... I had heard of the hype around Perfect Chemistry but I had no intention to read it, until my husband picked it as my next book...<br /><br />Now I see what all the hype is about! The book instantly grips you, I was intrigued by Alex's world and Brittany's world and how different yet how similar they were. I felt bad for Brittany for having to go through the things she went through at home, with her sister, with her parents and I felt bad for Alex feeling stuck in what he was. I appreciate the research that was put into the gang life for this book and I love how Alex mixed Spanish into his sentences, it made the dialog spicy. The unexpected twists and turns left you wanting to know more. And the slow process of a building friendship was refreshing. In too many YA books these days, it seems like that's always rushed.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favorites for the year! And if you haven't read this yet, you should!
1595825045|5.0|This artbook is utterly beautiful. When I first tore open the box and laid my eyes upon the product, I literally gasped in amazement. After watching The Last Airbender movie, simply thinking about Avatar filled my body with disgust and made my gag reflex quite sensitive. I couldn't even watch the show without having terrifying flashbacks of the disgraceful film. Thankfully, looking at this book reopened my eyes to the sheer brilliance of the true series. Every single word written in this book is basically pie for an avatard like me. Bottom line: I ate it all up. And I loved it. This book is filled with details about the series, how the makers came up with their ideas, what inspired them, and so much more. What REALLY put the icing on the cake is the artwork (duh h4x0rzzzzz, it's an artbook). Every little pencil sketch, drawing, painting, left me in awe. So stunning! Most of the time when I buy books, I'll read/look at them once or twice and then it spends the rest of its book-life sitting on my bookshelf, collecting book-dust. I can guarantee you that this is a treasure that won't have the opportunity to sit still. Definitely worth the buy!
B002VPE1XY|4.0|This case works fine.  It's very small, so check the dimensions before purchasing.  I use it for my flip-phone, although it's actually supposed to be for small cameras, I think.  It has a flap in the back with velcro, so it hangs on to a belt quite well, but it doesn't do too well if you just want to tuck the flap into the side of your shorts elastic, because the velcro will tear up your clothes.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I really enjoyed Band of Horses' first two albums, so I was excited to hear their third album, Infinite Arms. I was definitely not disappointed. I have listened to this album a dozen times straight through and love the soft melodies and interesting lyrics. Most of the album is slow, thoughtful, and soothing. There are two or three more upbeat, fast-tempo songs, and these are good but still my least favorite. Overall, a great album. Just as good, maybe even better than their previous two.
B000LN7HUC|4.0|I can't seem to set the simmer ring (tab opened) on the burner when it is in the windscreen; the curved edges of the screen keep the ring from sitting flush on the burner. This is a minor quibble for me, as I tend to stick to things that need to boil rather than simmer.     Denatured alcohol is available really cheap anywhere you might buy house paint. I have a big can that has lasted me for years. I take an 8oz. plastic squeeze bottle of fuel for a long weekend and usually come home with some fuel.     Alcohol burners in general are very susceptible to wind, so be mindful of where / how you set the stove up, to minimize wind.     This is by far the easiest cook set I've ever owned (though these days I'm more likely to carry the liberty mountain kit inside a larger pot so I can share). Fill the burner 2/3 full, strike a match, and you're on your way. This is a very nice kit for solo cooking.
0307454541|5.0|Read the trilogy in order and read them all. They're really one book broken into three parts. You will fall in love with Lisbeth and suffer with Blomkvist. Larsson writes with a love of his characters and an easy, meandering pace to his novels. Still, you are on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. Absolutely fabulous character development. Great reads!!
B000V86OKG|4.0|Of the four seasons of Dexter, this season could appropriately be called the best. There was a whole lot of sexual content, more than the others, due to one character, but other than that I completely enjoyed it.
B000UJ48SQ|4.0|Barry Lyndon is good movie and I'm happy I saw it.  It could be faulted for being occasionally slow by today's standards, but what it does have going for it is a sympathetic and likable main character Redmann Barry, aka Barry Lyndon, who goes from countryboy of no standing to the ranks of nobility (almost) by the twists and turns of fate.  At 184 minutes, it's not a short movie and there are some places in it that are about as interesting as the court music which accompanies it.  But, at the same time, while there are lulls in the story, it mostly tends to keep interest.  Add to that the Kubrick sense of tone and irony, with a narrator stepping in from time to time to give a somewhat amused overview and finally you've got a movie that is quite watchable.  It doesn't take long to get into, the filming is gorgeous and the recognizable touch of the master is unmistakable.  It's a study of character and a study of \\"nobility\\" perhaps, in both senses of the word.  While nowhere near as intense as say \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" or \\"The Shining\\" the stealth and pace of the direction and a quiet cosmic irony that is the signature of Kubrick is there.<br /><br />As to the mastering of this DVD, it's not sure if it wants to be widescreen or full screen - a thin black line on the top and bottom of the screen suggests this (so you get a widescreen that is so wide on the top and bottom it could almost be full).  In fact, I didn't find it overly distracting.  The quality of the transfer was superb in every other regard, and there were English subtitles (yes!).  There are no special features, and the only other drawback to the package is that the case is \\"environmentally friendly\\" which means half the plastic is taken out and that we are supposed to beleive this is good for the environment.
B003LAH7MU|1.0|Oh, Sting.  My affection for the man and his work gives me the courage even now to pronounce that he was the first popular artist I ever loved, first via the Police and shortly thereafter through his zany body of solo work.  Then he'd fallen out of the \\"Artists to Take Seriously\\" category, but he hadn't become a joke, yet.  Now Sting is one of the rudest jokes in music: it would be hilarious if it weren't such a travesty.  He embodies the stereotypical \\"maturation\\" of tastes: start out aggressive with punk rock, compose yourself into adult contemporary, mellow and settle into classical music, calmed down, cup of tea by your side.  That isn't maturation, it's decomposition, and \\"Symphonicities\\" is the gross product.  This album is a Police fan's nightmare.  Listening to \\"Sting's most celebrated songs re-imagined for symphonic arrangement\\" is like watching the scene in \\"[[ASIN:B00009Y3N6 Brimstone and Treacle]]\\" in which Sting's character rapes a mentally-ill woman--twelve times.    \\"It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile,\\" Sting reprises on this new rendition of \\"Englishman in New York.\\"  True that.  It takes a stronger man than myself to suffer offal and do the same.  Take said rendition of \\"Englishman,\\" a song that, in its true incarnation, gives the impression that it could break its composure any time it feels like doing so (though of course Sting never feels like doing so).  This version is drained of the sense of uncertainty which energizes the song, leaving it pitifully stodgy, depressed, mechanical, and restrained.  \\"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic,\\" on the other hand, sounds like it belongs at a banquet in a Disney tale.  \\"Roxanne\\" seems refitted for a Richard Gere movie.  The original song is about a tragedy.  Stripped of emotion, reduced to mechanics, this new \\"re-imagined\\" \\"Roxanne\\" becomes a tragedy.  \\"She's Too Good for Me,\\" sufficiently amusing on \\"[[ASIN:B000005IL1 Ten Summoner's Tales]],\\" is now the stuff of (bad) Broadway, and \\"We Work the Black Seam,\\" portentous enough on his debut, is now nauseating.  \\"I Burn for You,\\" as performed by the Police the defining sexually-charged rock song in my mind, is, as rendered here, worthy of mediocre rom-coms.  It could also be a fitting serenade from the nearsighted old man in the Pixar shorts.  At least \\"The End of the Game\\" is almost pretty, because, and this is the nicest thing I can say about any of these re-imaginings, it's almost a rock song.    The root atrocity of Sting's atrocious \\"Symphonicities\\" is that it reduces these songs to compositions.  Individuals that don't know the difference between the two, or will argue that there isn't one, may buy the album and may actually enjoy it.  There is a difference.  \\"Symphonicities\\" is garish evidence that one is a form of expression, and the other a form of manufacture.  Why Sting has to manufacture anything so lackadaisical with his unearthly fortune is beyond me.  Trust me: buying this rot is below you.

B000066NW0|4.0|I remember when I first heard `Complicated'.  I loved that whole angst rock anthem matched with Alanis Morrissette vocal stylings so much that I instantly purchased the album with the chick who looked like the love child of Christina Aguilera and Jennifer Aniston (squint and cock your head to the right a little and you'll see it) on the cover.  Overall I was pleased.  This is her weakest effort (I know I'm in the minority when I say that her third album was her best) but it shows the promise that she capitalized on with `Under My Skin'.<br /><br />I don't believe for one second that she is a punk, but thankfully she ditches that `style' after one blimp on the album.<br /><br />The albums best tracks are certainly the ones that lace Avril's harsher vocals with catchy pop/rock musicality.  The opening track `Losing Grip' is a stunning example of this, giving her an edge as well as a vulnerability that makes her accessible.  `Complicated' is still one of my favorite tracks from her, even if it lacks a maturity that she attained on her sophomore album.  For her first single, it is a pretty good introduction to her approach.  In all honesty, some of the tracks tend to lose originality, and some tracks like `Unwanted' come across as uninspired and forgettable (and a tad out of her zone).<br /><br />I really like the touching sentiment she brings to `I'm With You'.  There is an honesty there that suits her well.  Lyrically, it has that `teenage' corner covered, but there is an air of something deeper than expected present.  She takes a similar approach with `Tomorrow', which works rather well.<br /><br />Songs like `Mobile' come off a tad Michelle Branch like, playing more to the pop side of her genre.  She rubs away her edge a tad with the playful vocal delivery, and her music tends to lean maybe too close to pop/country here.  `Things I'll Never Say' has a similar structure, but the vulnerable chorus structure actually gives me goosebumps, which is a good thing.<br /><br />The album's closing tracks tend to be a tad bland, which is a shame since it's always important to go out with a bang; keep them wanting more.<br /><br />`Anything But Ordinary' has a nice concept and overall it is delivered effectively, but it comes off a tad `ordinary', which is somewhat ironic when you think about it.  It is also very pop influenced, and the lyrical content seems pretty amateurish.  `My World' is flawed, but it is fun and forgivable.  `Nobody's Fool' is neither of those things.  In fact, this song is possibly the worst thing she's ever released.  The rapping is kind of gross.<br /><br />Overall, this is an uneven debut that is well worth listening to thanks to this girls natural born talent.  A lot of my friends tease me endlessly for liking her, but whatever.  I can't help it.<br /><br />For those of you interested, my track ranking:<br /><br />1) Complicated<br />2) Losing Grip<br />3) I'm With You<br />4) Things I'll Never Say<br />5) Tomorrow<br />6) Mobile<br />7) Sk8er Boi<br />8) My World<br />9) Unwanted<br />10) Anything By Ordinary<br />11) Naked<br />12) Too Much to Ask<br />13) Nobody's Foolbe a tad bland, which is a shame since it's always important to go out with a bang; keep them wanting more.    `Anything But Ordinary' has a nice concept and overall it is delivered effectively, but it comes off a tad `ordinary', which is somewhat ironic when you think about it.

B002ZG997M|1.0|well, just as the title stated, I hated this movie.  what a waste of time. I usually like Washington's movie but this one is even worst then \\"when the earth stood still\\".  The plot suck so bad and the storyline even worst. I usually don't write reviews because most movies I buy are based on reviews and I have never hated any movies.  I like a movie more or less but this waste of time... i don't want to waste any more of my time writing a review for this.
142313494X|5.0|My 8 year old has been pestering me to read this since we have a rule which states she can not read certain books until I've read them first. I know she would love this book! I always have always loved Greek Mythology so with that as the main theme I was hooked. The lightning Thief takes you on an extraordinary journey into the world of Greek myth's with suspenseful scenes as Percy searches to discover who is father is thus discovering his true identity as well uncovering who stole the lightening bolt! While sometimes tense for the young reader it is also with enjoyable humor dappled throughout involving comical satyrs and spunky kids, which even made me laugh a few times. I didn't find the scenes as scary as some in the 13th Reality or Fablehaven which is always a plus for a child with an over-active imagination at night! I will definitely be getting this series for my kids and will continue reading it myself.

B002ZG980U|5.0|As soon as the film began, a chill went up my spine; a string of goosebumps. This doesn't happen very often and immediately I knew that this was going to be something special. Other than the extraordinary special effects, the most impressive aspect of the film is that every person in the main cast is important to the storyline. Even though this clearly revolves around Cobb, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), Ariadne (Ellen Page), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) are all given an appropriate amount of screen time and take full advantage of the time they're given. Every character has at least one moment where they have their time to shine, which is quite an accomplishment given how many people are in the cast. Even Saito (Ken Watanabe) and Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy) have their moments.<br /><br />The film is fabulously complex and there are so many things going on at once in the ladder half of the film that it results in the sci-fi actioner being incredibly difficult to spoil entirely without a longwinded explanation. I could tell you the last scene in the film right now and while it would make sense, things wouldn't fall into place or be entirely appreciated unless you knew everything leading up to that point.<br /><br />The film is superbly written. I'm a huge fan of films that make you think or are able to create something that at least feels like it's completely original and Inception accomplishes both of those things. On one hand, stealing anything you hold valuable from your dreams seems pretty far fetched. On the other, everyone dreams and everybody has secrets or at least something they keep locked away from most people. Imagining that those things are easily accessible to certain people because they've cracked the code on how to maneuver through your mental defenses is pretty intriguing and makes it seem easier to relate to since it's something everyone experiences.<br /><br />While everyone is waiting for the follow-up to The Dark Knight, Inception isn't the type of film that should be swept under the rug in the meantime. It's fantastically original, contains a spectacular cast where everyone involved delivers a strong performance, is wonderfully engrossing, and is definitely up to the high standard Christopher Nolan has set for himself with the other marvelous films on his resume. In typical Chris Nolan fashion, the ending is a huge tease but it's goosebump-worthy, completely fitting, and difficult to imagine the film ending any other way. Inception is Nolan's magnum opus and will be near impossible to beat as the movie of the year for 2010.of film that should be swept under the rug in the meantime.

You probably won't find a better set of headphones at ANY price.  I know that there is the MK II version of these now, but unless someone is going to buy them for you, the K-240 is the only way to go.  Not only are they the best sounding headphones, they are also very comfortable.  If you're a broadcaster or podcaster, you won't be disappointed.  And the price!  You can't beat the price right now!  Buy these before they're gone forever!
B00386OWUC|4.0|I have enjoyed all the Michael Haneke films I have seen so far, and this is perhaps his best effort yet, but it is hard to tell really just how good because the film is black and white with all the old problems of black and white foreign films and white subtitles.  The font is smaller than usual, which isn't a big  problem on a  large screen, but much of the background is either white or light gray making the legibility difficult.  Sometimes I  had to give up trying to read dialogue and either guess at plot develpment or just wait for the next scene shot with  darker subject matter.  With their small size, even outlining the subtitles is black didn't help; still illegible much of the time.  Someone should redo this rather fine release and reissue it properly.<br /><br />While picture quality is quite adequate, it didn't come  up to the Blu-ray standards possible for a film made today.  Perhaps it was transferred from a PAL video onto Blu-ray, who  knows.
B0037QGS0K|5.0|This time the idea sounded worse on paper than the result which raises to the occasion.<br />Romance novel as involving film with erotic drama, great cinema and engrossing story.<br />Nice architecture. Very stylish like Brian De Palma<br />and a great BD ... very
0140557741|5.0|Zoom by Istvan Banyai - This picture book is entirely devoid of text.  From a literary viewpoint, there's not much to say about this book.  From an artistic vantage point, this book is deliciously wrought with creativity that will get any young child's imagination flowing.  The illustrations will draw you in and the lack of verbiage can create a fabulous opportunity to open up dialogue and encourage discussion.  Banyai's second book in this series - \\"Re-Zoom\\" tells a different story in much the same way.  Both books are highly recommended.<br /><br />DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers
044024367X|5.0|Don't be fooled by the negative reviews here. I think this is one of the better Reacher novels I've read. Think I've read about 7 or 8 of them. This one boils it all down to essentials. Cracking good read!<br /><br />Think some folks are just upset that the political tone is a bit on the Liberal side. Thought it seemed pretty middle of the road myself.
159448385X|5.0|I am just 3/4 of the way through this totally absorbing book and find it hard to put down. The unimaginable cruelty shown these Afghan women by the men in their lives, both husband and strangers, defies belief. I particularly like the way it is presented, i.e., the voice of the protagonist shifts back and forth from Mariam to Lailia. These two brave women find a life despite the crushing violence that can explode at any minute. Love for the children and each other seems to be their salvation. Aren't we lucky to have been born in America?
0446563048|5.0|I strongly recommend this book.This is not one of the management books that contain dry academic and theoretical material.Instead this is written by someone who has practical experience in the business world.Therefore it is full of great practical material which you will not find anywhere else.  The book is an easy to read and  because it does not contain unnecessary and difficult phraseology.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|Ever since I heard the singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"White Horse\\", I've liked the music of Taylor Swift.  I guess that some of my FFA aggie peers influenced my interest in the new pop-country, though I've always liked country music anyway.<br /><br />The music of \\"Fearless\\" is hardly what one would call true country, but it does have some influences and a sound that attains to its origins (for example, banjos playing in the background of \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong With Me\\").  Taylor's voice occasionally has a feel that hits close to the country home, and yet never quite makes you think she's a country gal.  Nevertheless, her voice is unique in sound and has a certain charm to it. There are a couple of songs here that overpower her voice with guitar and other enhancements, such as \\"The Way I Loved You\\" and \\"Forever and Always\\", which is really a shame, since her voice has a tendency to be quiet.  Overall I recommend this CD to anyone that likes the new country wave or pop lovers, since it appeals to both.<br /><br />Finally (in my opinion), the top 5 songs to buy as singles:  \\"The Best Day\\", \\"White Horse\\", \\"Fifteen\\", \\"You Belong With Me\\", and \\"Love Story\\".

0446693804|4.0|I never knew who Nicholas Sparks was before, never read his books. Maybe I have seen them on bookshelves but they looked to me as part of a literary land of sobs and love I have never cared about much in my life. It was horror thrillers, psychological thrillers for me. Nicholas Sparks never fell under those categories.     But one thing I did do was watch the movies that his books were the basis for. Not surprisingly, since I had a close friend who took in such movies like they were collectibles. The first movie I came in contact with, watched in earnest one stuffy, humid evening, was A Walk to Remember, which touched me with the innocence and tenderness of teenage love and the sadness and tragedy of unrealized life. It broke something within me and made me realize the potential of romance fiction, if done in a way that made the goals of the characters seemingly unattainable. Broken relationships, tight family circumstances that would hinder lovers, you name it. Such has been done before, but never in the way have I seen in A Walk to Remember.    So I started to hunt down the book. Got it finally on a day in town and I tore into it. Took no more than a couple of days and, yes, it does have its differences from the movie (or vice versa, rather). After finishing it and many times when I was knee deep in the story, I had tinges of regret, having already watched the movie. The movie spoiled many of the heart tugging moments I would have had if I never watched it. It does have much of the same tenderness the film had but this book feels like it has its own soul and life.    What can be said about Nicholas' descriptions, both about the characters and the locales, other than that they are surprisingly sparse for descriptions, allowing for much of the miscellaneous details to happen instead in our vivid imaginations. Perhaps that could be a technique he employs to allow for better resonance, but one could argue how this could simply be Nicholas' style of writing. He prefersto let the story be about heart matters. Emotional factors are far more important to Nicholas than the details of a character's clothing. However, whatever detail he put in there about the characters only serves the purpose of driving the story to an emotional level that Nicholas wants the readers to be. One perfect example would be the descriptions of Jamie Sullivan, the normal and yet immensely beautiful main character who manages to find true love (and it could be true, if you leave a little bit of room for disbelief). She turns from a perfectly normal looking girl to someone almost painful to imagine as a skinny, bony girl. This only brings the reader to tears, as it did for me.     Dozen of moments in the book can make your heart yearn to turn the pages, tender moments like Jamie and Scott falling in love, the degrees of love they go through, from bring friends to being co-actors in a play to being eventually together forever. Poignant love and special friendship are the important undertones for the book as it goes along at pages at a time. But one can't help to realize that the special relationship between Scott and Jamie isn't all that unlikely. Uncommon would be a better description.        Nicholas could have added a little more flavor in the dialogue too and that would have pushed A Walk to Remember to being a five star book. Instances when Scott could've articulate something more likely than a mere \\"I'm afraid, too\\" or \\"How can you say that?\\" What's worse is that this lack of depth in dialogue runs all through the book.     One thing: never watch the movie before reading A Walk to Remember. It made me cry and I'm not afraid to say that as a male reader. If there is a perfect introduction to the heartbreak and sobby genre (haha) or to Nicholas' work in general, this must be it. The premise seems interesting enough and it has the ability to gobble up chunks of your time while giving you an escape of unbridled romance. If it won over a hardened reader suchas me, I guarantee it doesn't sound as corny as my review lets on.
B002BWP4A6|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />We're told at the beginning of 'The White Ribbon', that this is a story that seeks to \\"clarify things that happened in this country\\", as if to imply that we're about to gain some insight into the origins of Nazism. But director Michael Haneke has made it clear that he was aiming for a more generic understanding of the roots of Fascism when he was quoted as saying that the film is about \\"the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature.\\" Note that Haneke doesn't speak of \\"Nazism\\" or \\"Fascism\\" but uses the modern term \\"terrorism\\" to describe the actions of many of the characters in his film. The setting of Haneke's tale is the fictional village of Eichwald, right before World War I. There is virtually no effort to link the story to actual historical events except for the specific reference to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand and the start of World War I at the film's end. Haneke does this because his story is really a PARABLE; by making it (in part) applicable to all nationalities and to different historical epochs, Haneke, in effect, minimizes the responsibility of the German and Austrian peoples who lived during the time leading up to the Holocaust and participated in it, either directly or indirectly. If his parable is universally applied, the unique horror of Nazism can't really be any worse than any other atrocities committed by other groups in history. The generic nature of his story (or parable), bears this out.<br /><br />Despite his insistence to the contrary, it remains obvious that 'Ribbon' IS also Haneke's attempt to explain the rise of the Third Reich. He is not unlike a bevy of German and Austrian filmmakers who utilize a fictional melodramatic narrative to assuage their own guilt (as well as an attempt to speak for the collective guilt of a nation). It's not easy being German or Austrian when your recent ancestors are linked to mass murderers. If the ancestors are portrayed as likable, normal people but also capable of violence (or supporting violence), this would lead to unpleasant feelings of cognitive dissonance. But what if the history is reduced to a more simplistic formula consisting of monsters, victims and saints? The viewer no longer has to be confused rooting for a complex Tony Soprano type of character--an extremely violent man who is also likable and sympathetic.<br /><br />In 'The Reader', the monsters are the cold Concentration Camp guards in the docket, who won't admit their guilt. The victim, however, is Hanna Schmitz, the guard who is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape. The saint is the protagonist, Michael Berg, who can still have sympathy for the 'tragic' Hanna as well as offer to pay money to a Holocaust victim's foundation.<br /><br />Haneke also must create his share of monsters. In doing so, a guilty populace no longer has to believe that their grandparents were part of a 'normal' silent majority that supported Hitler. How could anyone's ancestors be like the Eichwald town doctor, pastor or baron? The doctor is someone who sexually humiliates his long-term mistress, the midwife, as well as sexually abuses his own daughter. The pastor utilizes corporal punishment to raise his children, which leads to acts of revenge on their part. What's more, he promotes unhealthy sexual feelings in his children, by denouncing masturbation as a sin. The Baron neglects workers on his estate, leading to the death of a worker's wife in a work-place accident. He also neglects his wife, the Countess, who ultimately leaves, after she accuses him of allowing a lot of unhealthy stuff to go on in the village.<br /><br />Like Hanna Schmitz whose behavior was excused on the basis of being raised in a bad environment, the White Ribbon kids also get a free pass. They are the 'victims' of the monstrous fathers and enabling mothers. How can any child be completely responsible for crimes committed as an adult if the upbringing was so horrendous? This is the film's 'hook'--it's the kids who committed most (or all) of the crimes in the village: the doctor is injured after his horse falls in an encounter with a trip wire; the baron's son is hung upside down in the forest and caned; and a mentally challenged kid is tortured. The kids cover their tracks by appearing en masse at the victim's home, asking if they can be of any help.<br /><br />Finally, there is the 'saint'--here is the character which a guilty audience can identify with ('Hey my grandfather didn't support Hitler at all--he was apolitical and a nice guy to boot!) The school teacher fits the bill perfectly. Not only does he save the hapless Eva after she's fired but figures out who's responsible for the crimes committed in the village and has the guts to reveal the ugly truth to the town's power broker, the Pastor!<br /><br />While it is very wrong to blame today's generation in Austria and Germany for the sins of the parents and grandparents, it is equally disturbing to realize that there is a pattern of denial amongst the younger generation in regards to the idea that the enablers of the Holocaust were not the monsters, victims and saints depicted by Mr. Haneke but rather ordinary people who one could easily identify with.<br /><br />Despite its facile explanation of the roots of Fascism, the White Ribbon has some value, precisely because it sparks debate. With its austere, Bergman-like, black and white cinematography, and recreation of a bygone era, Haneke scores points for atmosphere. But instead of focusing on 'why' the Holocaust occurred, the 'what' and 'how' would have been more than sufficient.hild be completely responsible for crimes committed as an adult if the upbringing was so horrendous?

0385504225|1.0|As a mystery / thriller The Lost Symbol fails on nearly every level, as a literary work it isn't even in the ballpark.    The only reason I finished this book was to write the review. It's that bad.    The highlight of The Lost Symbol is the plot. It's almost decent for a thriller, though the 200 pages of plot are surrounded on each side by 100+ pages of cheesy background and pseudo-science assertions. Then, at the end, when the story reaches a climax, the plot lies down on the ground, gives up, and just plain goes flat.     Brown's writing style is so painful it makes the reader wince. How may times can one use the word sacred to describe any random action unrelated to the story? Entire chapters that don't contribute to the plot, endless descriptions of unrelated objects, and language full of deadwood abound in this book. To convince the reader of the story, Brown makes his case for pseudo-science or symbolism by mentioning a \\"fact\\" early, later making a reference to it, and by the third character mention it has become reality. At times I didn't know if I felt offended or insulted, neither of which is what a reader wants. And talk about ivory tower academic cheesy. Wildly applauding students enthralled with a lecture on the Ancient Mysteries? Langdon's supposed Harvard students opening their eyes to the world of symbols?     The Lost Symbol characters are heavy handed devices for Brown's message of pseudo-science. Robert Langdon plays the role of skeptic to convince the reader of the plot. Basic pattern: Langdon sees a symbol in something, states it is a myth, and then becomes convinced it isn't a myth when another character points something out. Over and over again.... The brilliant scientist and her rich, powerful brother come across as wealthy eccentrics espousing random thoughts about mystical powers. Only the villain, too much like a Thomas Harris character, really fits the thriller role.    The biggest failure is more fundamental. Brown's story simply isn't believable. Noetic science, though really having no role to play in the book, is repeatedly referenced as the power to change the world. Why? How? Not to mention the science in \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" may be more believable. Mystic secrets holding enormous power have been out of site for thousands of years, but simple web searches provide complete backgrounds? The Ancients knew this power, but still choose to live with goats in the desert, or in filthy cities? A CIA internal discussion board (who has time for this kind of stuff at work?) offers redacted documents to the outside world? A national security crisis that is less shocking than last year's stories in the Washington Post? The secret is hidden, but on the internet(or in tattoo books) one can find complete backgrounds. The smug last 100 pages with no interest or bearing on the story are too much.    Skip this one.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|If you love Irish/Celtic type music you will love this performance by Celtic Woman. The cover refers to a New Journey and journey is the key word here.  This performance takes place in front of a castle called Slane Castle and the setting is beautiful.<br />The performance having been done outdoors, adds an unexpected and vulnerable element to the performance and it is excellent entertainment.  Adults and children alike will enjoy this DVD.
B002GU605G|5.0|Hang your head no more and beg no more! Not only does this Omnibus Edition bring Love in all its beauty - and a lot more powerful and clear - it offers three other essential cds and an incredible, comprehensive book full of insights into the recording period with quotes from everyone involved. It does illumimate some dark corners... Read on, everybody!<br /><br />Also, being able to listen to the Singles and Demos cds with amazing rare tracks is pure delight, and so is the 1985 concert at the Hammersmith arena where it's possible to feel all the excitement and freshness of this music. Now 25 years after, it's a real 'blast from the past', as Ian puts it when introducing Christians.<br /><br />The concept behind the box is just perfect, and the mini vinyl replicas are more than adequate. I couldn't have asked for more. This is the Cult at its most adventurous and unique.<br /><br />I'd say this is the eternal reward for all of us who've waited so patiently for this treasure to be unearthed and released. Love obviously very soon everybody at long last!

0802714544|4.0|You'd have to be a product of Generation Y not to love a good old Cold War spy story. No matter how many times I see or hear or read it, the ideological conflict as presented in the form of a dour-faced, steroid-pumping, muscle-bound Russki versus a hard-scrabble, street-smart, freedom-loving American is enough to bring back memories of bomb drills at school, a vision of Reagan declaring the Great Satan, and those epic Celtics/Lakers battles that defined a decade. All of us here at The Literate Man freely admit that we still pause in our channel surfing to watch long scenes (which we all know by heart) of Rocky IV, Red October, and Red Dawn, among others. Ah ... those were the days when gas was cheap and you knew who your enemies were or, more importantly, where your enemies were. It seems so long ago now.    What was I talking about again? Oh right, the novel. Sorry about that, I got lost in Cold War reverie.    So, I picked up my first le Carré novel, Absolute Friends, in the Frankfurt Airport on return from a visit to the former East Germany and the Czech Republic in, oh say, 2004. The novel chronicles the Cold War relationship of Mundy and Sasha, who work together to help MI6 bring down East Germany and eventually find themselves betrayed by the forces of globalization, which (as products of the Cold War, like me) they never fully understand. It was a very enjoyable book, and I made a mental note to pick up more le Carré as I was able. I saw the film adaptation of The Constant Gardner and I read Mission Song, both of which I enjoyed, though neither as much as Absolute Friends. And so, when my mother sent along a copy of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (thanks, Mom!), I thought it would be an enjoyable read and a trip down memory lane along the lines of what occurs when I watch any of the aforementioned Cold War movies.    I. WAS. BLOWN. AWAY. It was like I was that high-tech PPSI punch-measuring machine at the end of the Ivan Drago training montage in RockyIV. This is--bar none--the best Cold War spy story we have ever heard, seen, or read. And I now understand why it was named one of Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Novels. Ok, so about the story. It's dark ... and I mean depths-of-the-human-soul dark, German winter solstice dark, Vito Corleone's office dark, well ... you get the idea. Alec Leamas heads up the West Berlin office of the British Secret Service (known as the Circus), until his best double agent is killed, his leadership comes under severe scrutiny, and he is recalled to London. Then, in the Cold War espionage equivalent of a last-second, Hail Mary pass into the end zone, Leamas is fired, sent to jail, and hung out for defection like a slab of beef set dangling from the roof of a den of wolves (sound familiar, The Departed?). Anyway, the bait is taken, the trap sprung, and Leamas goes over the wall to East Germany, leaving the lovely (love interest) Liz behind with instructions not to try to follow him. His mission? To frame his counterpart, the East German Muntz, as a double-agent for the British.     I'd give you the rest of the story, but then there'd be no point in you reading it. And you need to read it. The plot is exquisitely crafted, with twists and turns aplenty, but it is the psychological realism in the context of counter-espionage that sets the book apart from anything I have ever read on the subject. Le Carré does an excellent job of describing the amorality practiced on both sides of the Berlin Wall (and the English Channel) in the name of idealism. My advice? Turn off that rerun of The Hunt for Red October (as good as it is--I love Sean Connery as a Russki, I don't care what his accent is) and get your hands on a copy of this book. Do it now, comrade.

068987751X|5.0|This book holds fond memories of bed time reading for me.  It was by far one of my favorite books as a child and remains so today.  When a child wants a pet, he or she writes to the zoo.  The zoo sends crazy animals for pets.  Many children love to guess what kind of animal judging by the shape of the box.  To discover the animal, lift the box!  No matter how many times I read this book, it is still one of the best books I have ever read!

B003P8BB5W|5.0|Have not seen the movie, don't even plan on it, but I have come to expect excellent soundtracks from this series, and this one did not disappoint. In the day that I've had the soundtrack, I've now ordered CDs from Florence + the Machine and The Dead Weather, and will take a listen at several other artists featured. You do NOT have to be a fan of the books or films to really appreciate the soundtracks. They stand on their own just fine!
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I gave this movie a 5 rating. What a relief it was to be able to sit down and watch a movie with my grandson and not have to put my hands over his eyes because of scenes not appropriate for his viewing.

0399156577|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.. I let myself read a few of the reviews before i read the book and that really was a mistake..  Once i sat down to read i really got into the book and it was very hard to put down.. I enjoyed the dogs and i enjoyed the couple themselves..  I felt the confrontation between Fe and Perry was well done because he was not the focus killer of the book.. She got to deal with her past and move on.  That left more time for a confortation with the real killer in the book..  It was not long and drawn out which was good and i really liked that Simon came to her rescue even though she really did not need it.. I would have like to seen Fe go see the reporter to close that out but i feel it ended well.. A very well written book from Nora Roberts again..  This would make a great movie..
0596005903|2.0|Honestly, I really don't understand how anyone can give this book 5 stars. To start off on a positive tone, I'll say what I liked about it.    1) Lots of information. There is no denying this, it is very informitive. However, this is a double edged swords (will discuss later)    2) The basic drivers are described pretty well. The scull driver is a good way to ease into driver development, imo. Simple enough that it's not too overwhelming and ununderstandable, but not overly simple so that you actually get an idea of what's going on.    3) It's free.    That's it for the positives. Now for a huge list of negatives.    1) Most of the information is irrelevent. I feel like the authors lost focus as the book went on, and forgot they were not writing a general \\"Linux Kernel\\" book but a specific book for drivers. Many a time do they spend pages upon pages going on about something, only to mention \\"but this is never used by read driver developers\\" at the end. You end up in a really unpleasant situation where you have to sift through a bunch of useless info to get to the useful stuff. Most of the time I ended up just searching google, and got better results.    2) Lack of more complex examples. Let's face it, no one needs to write an extremely simple char driver. However, that's as complex as the examples get. Beyond the scull driver, it's just code fragments. I sincerely hope you don't have to write a serial tty device. Which leads me to my next point.    3) Outdated. Many kernel API changes have been made to the point where the code is no longer compilable (especially on the tty front). Methods used in the book have been done away with in the newer kernel API's.    Honestly, you're much better off just resorting to Google. If you want to write your own driver and you read through this book, you'll still have no idea where to start. The functions in the scull driver are well-described, but that's it. The authors use too much space writing about useless crap you really don't care about, and this comes at the expense of useful info  that will actually help you write drivers.    This book will probably come up on your google searches, and it might be worth it to skim the regular chapters. Honestly though, it's not going to tell you anything your other search results won't. This is most definitely not the \\"end all, be all\\" of writing linux drivers, it just happens to be the only one.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I cannot get enough of the phantom and was so happy to see this album was now available.  The music is terrific.  The album is how I first \\"knew\\" the phantom, so this one is extra special.  Again.  Many terrific melodies.  Get it.  You will love it!
B003ES5JDS|5.0|I was so pleasantly, incredibly surprised by  the pure awesomeness of this movie.     Bruce Greenwood has done the impossible and manages to do an even better Batman voice than the legendary Kevin Conroy. Greenwood is magnificent.     I love all the violence, this is certainly not your Saturday morning cartoon for kids. I LOVE all the characters that make an appearance, and the story is great. This is bar far the best animated production we've seen from DC, the best animated Batman movie they've ever made-- even better than Mask of the Phantasm.
B002VPE1OS|5.0|I applied this screen cover more two weeks ago and thought I'd see how it held up.  In the past, screen protector/cover would get covered with grime and become difficult to read the screen beneath.  Some protectors have a clingy feel that cause the finger to skip across the screen instead of glide.  I have not had any of these problems with this protector.<br /><br />Installation:  It came with clear instructions and tabs marked 1, 2 so you don't do something out of order and waste the product.  You start by removing the old protector and then using the provided cloth to clean the screen.  Peel back #1 and carefully apply the protector to the screen being careful to line it up properly and avoid bubbles.  Then use the enclosed cardboard smoother to press out wrinkles and bubbles.  I had one tiny bubble left on my screen which is better than what I've had in the past.  Finally, peel away #2 and you're done.  The matte finish is easy on the eyes and my finger glides across the screen smoothly.  I've used it now for two weeks and it is still firmly in place and doing its job.
0385504225|4.0|I like fast-paced mystery novels. I finished Dan Brown's latest (The Lost Symbol), and now I'm working on David Baldacci's \\"Stone Cold\\". I'll post a review on that one later.<br /><br />Is it fair to compare them? Excuse me - I have to go mix myself another Martini...<br /><br />OK. Here's my honest take on Brown's novel. The entire story takes place in one evening. I couldn't put the book down - it was quite a roller coaster ride actually, which appeals to this reviewer who thinks Brian on \\"Family Guy\\" is cool, but seriously, it is quite well crafted... mmm - until the last chapter. It didn't stand out like it should have. The anticipation built up is eventually deflated in the last chapter... I've seen this before in other novels. Like Grisham. It's as if they get burned out; some kind of writer's fatigue.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong - PLEASE read it. The book scores an 8 out of 10. The last chapter? Perhaps 6 outa 10. Other than that, a very entertaining read.<br /><br />Sorry Danny boy... (or... at least, your ghost writer).
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|Gere, Lopez and Saradon very good cast all doing this film their best. I love how the film took the foreign film and made it American very well. The dancing was great and the love in the family was there. I can't say enough positive things about this well done film.
0385504225|3.0|Lost Smybol is a bit slow, but it is good for one thing especially; it is an unerringly accurate account of Free Masonry.  Masons are every so often misunderstood! They are not Yale Skull and Crossbones or some secret plotting Bilderberger type socieity.  It is a weak vestage of ancient wisdom, however,the words and symbols are still there even if most Masons have forgotten them.  It gives a detailed, fair picture of the origins and purpose of Masonry, it's real purpose, which is exceptionally noble. The casual observer can easily see how far Masons have fallen from their honorable calling and obligations.    Further, the 'coded' wisdom in the book is there for anyone who wants to read slowly, take notes, and live a noble life accordingly. Do not confuse it with dogma, religion, subversive societies,or any sort of voodoo. It is timeless knowledge,lying dormant among old men who largely know only the words and have lost the meaning.  Recommended as (accurate) historical fiction; it is so-so as an adventure.    While I subscribe to the writing style of the protagonist being a bit dumb and getting smarter as the story progresses (ala Matrix I), Brown could give his characters a whopping bit more savvy. We have had enough of bumbling male figures since the antique cartoon, \\"Father Knows Best,\\" to the current \\"Simpsons\\" and it is time to resurrect manhood.  Brown missed a golden opportunity here.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Having seen the Cirque show, this brings back lots of terrific memories of how much I enjoyed that production.

0545123283|5.0|Can a book improve upon a stellar debut? Yes it can! \\"Linger\\" is the highly anticipated sequel to \\"Shiver\\", now marking two books in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, which will conclude with \\"Forever\\". Our favorite couple Sam and Grace are back, but shadows and clouds loom wherever they go, canceling out their good fortune of being together as humans.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />\\"Linger\\" reads like a modern-day Greek tragedy, two amorous and kind teenagers who swear an allegiance of love and devotion for all time, with the forces of evil trying to separate them: new werewolves, lost friends, a mysterious lupine death, interfering parents, and a chilling illness in the midst of spring. Sam and Grace are barely rejoicing Sam's return in his human form, grateful that the meningitis injection not only didn't kill Sam, but has now kept the wolf at bay - for now. In the midst of this new found joy, Grace is keeping a secret - she is sick, not getting better, and feels the lunar pull of the werewolves beckoning her to join. Add to this, after months of essentially living together in her room, her negligent and adolescent parents discover Grace's love nest and throw Sam out, deciding to go into parental mode for the first time in their pathetic lives. If ever parents were ever the jerks of a story, Mr. and Mrs. Brisbane are it.<br /><br />The only reason Sam and Grace get caught is because Grace is starting to show symptoms of an unknown illness. Grace is grounded, while Sam returns \\"home\\", where he used to live with Beck and the other werewolves. There, he has to put up with a new and uncontrollable werewolf, Cole St. Clair, a self-destructive young man that Sam remembers from viewing in the back of Beck's car, but he also has seen him elsewhere - he just can't peg just where yet. Obnoxious but lovable Isabel is also back, with a meatier role and her own narrative, which alternates with Cole's own past and current story. Weave all these people together, and you're on a collision course of the unknown, a future that is not secure due to the unpredictable nature of the werewolf. As Sam becomes more assured in his footing in the human world, Grace is slipping away from him, slowly having her life leeched out of her because she's caught in physical limbo.<br /><br />This is another great entry by Maggie Stiefvater, an author whose writing has matured and strengthened with time, now knowing exactly where this story line is going and how it will all end.

B002JCSWV6|3.0|Clint Eastwood's latest film may be set against the backdrop of a post apartheid South Africa, but above all else it is a testament to the power of sports to bring people together and provide something to believe in.  In tis sense, it is one of the director's simplest works to date.  But that doesn't mean that it isn't a stirring film that offers much to think about.<br /><br />Invictus follows Nelson Mandella after his election as South Africa's president at the end of apartheid and his struggle to unite his country.  He finds his opportunity with the nation's rugy team; a group of mostly white players that have been exhibiting poor play and are on the verge of being disbanded by the nation's non-white majority who view them as a reminder of the oppression that they endured for nearly 50 years.  Mandella speaks up for the maligned group suggesting that keeping them intact would serve as a gesture of peace and forgiveness to the country's white minority who have lost their power and may fear reprisal.<br /><br />Mandella also reaches out to the captain of the rugby team (a beefed up Matt Damon) and encourages him to inspire his teammates to be more than they think are capable of.  Without saying so, he asks the team to win the 1995 world cup.  His hope is that his racially divided nation will come together to support a team that represents them all, not just the white minority.<br /><br />And so the movie follows the team as they undertake their overwhelming task of winning the world cup. They also take on the role of ambassadors to the angry and povery stricken citizens by traveling to the slums and teaching the game to children.  Since the story that the movie is based on is true, there is no need to bring cheap sentiment or melodramatic sub plots into the picutre.  Eastwood simply lets the story tell itself with predictable yet uplifting results.<br /><br />The performances are strong everywhere.  Morgan Freeman is the epitome of grace under pressure as Mandella and Matt Damon nicely captures the mixed emotions of a man who is put in the difficult position of inspiring his teammantes  and serving as a bridge between the nation's racial divide.  It is naive, of course, to believe that the team's improbable run and victory solved the nation's problems, or that Mandella was as infalible and saintly as he is portrayed here.  But it is easy to believe that for a brief time, a nation stood together and supported their rag-tag rugby team as they made everyone forget about the ever present problems that were continuing to rip them apart.  That is the ultimate power of sports; to provide something to believe in, even if for a brief period of time.  That is ultimately what Invictus accomplishes.ures the mixed emotions of a man who is put in the difficult position of inspiring his teammantes  and serving as a bridge between the nation's racial divide.

B003BWQE04|5.0|Side 'A' of this LP is one of the best places to hear the talents of this truly 'world-class' band. 'Tunnel Of Love', 'Romeo And Juliet', and 'Skateaway' in 1-2-3 succession have always seemed to be the strongest 'set'in the Dire Straits catalog (to me),and made this album one of my top-three Dire Straits favorites.    'Making Movies' was a turning point as David Knopfler had left the band to pursue a solo career path, and older brother Mark continued on with the original drummer (Pick Withers) and bassist (Bill Illsley). The vacuum left by Dave's departure was filled by seasoned 'session guitarist' Sid McGinnis, and keyboardist Roy Bittan from the E-Street Band. The 'spare' pub-rock band days were obviously over and the future direction for Dire Straits was only going to be upward.    Again, Warner Brothers has given us Dire Straits fans a superb vinyl version from the original ANALOG audio master tapes to delight ourselves with. Pressed in Germany on 180 gram 'audiophile-quality' vinyl, the record is FLAT (no warps whatsoever here!) and very, very QUIET, making it hard to believe one's listening to a spinning slab of vinyl plastic instead of sitting in the studio control room listening to the stereo 'master' tape in-person! WOW!    Regardless of whatever 'other' LP versions you may have of this recording, you'll NEED to get a couple copies of this release while they are still available in this fast-paced 'digital' world we live in. Record pressing 'runs' are small and usually only done once. Once these are gone, it will be a long, long, time before this sees release again on vinyl records THIS good!     My Highest Recommendation and FIVE STARS!!!!!

Maxell should do a better job of putting a date code on thier products as it does get misleading. Thanks to National for calling me. The 02 means feb of 2010, not 2002 like i thought.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off, I'd like to say.. I've always hated sci-fi series.. People can not understand why I don't have an appreciation for what they consider the best genre.. Well, whatever.. To each their own... Secondly... I own over 60 different Television series on DVD box sets.. It's the only way I ever watch Television.. Third.. This is the very first review I've ever written on Amazon...    With that said... I was very apprehensive about buying 'Firefly', but I was so intrigued by 'Serenity', that I felt the need to know the backbone behind the entire story.. And I've never been given more satisfaction with a Television show than the one received with 'Firefly'. The production was amazing from start to finish. Extremely well-thought out story lines.. A vast variety of personalities within every single character (Very likable characters, might I add) and a cast chemistry that can not be beat... The show has a beautiful blend of action, drama, and humor.. And that could be the reason why I felt it was so different from other sci-fi shows, films.. It was light-hearted, yet inexplicably serious when it needed to be.. I don't want to get into too much detail, but every single person deserves an opportunity to enjoy this work of art...     This show brought a few different sides out of me.. It made me appreciate sci-fi, took a hundred mile lead against all of my favorite TV shows and it inspired me to write a review on Amazon.com... May not sound like much, but all of that put together is a real rarity for a fella like me...     To put it in simple terms, IMHO 'Firefly' was the perfect show.. It was flawless.. Actually.. I take that back.. The only flaw was that it ended.. But like all good things.. it eventually came to an end... But please please please.. Give this show a try... I don't think you'll ever regret making the choice...
B000GH2YPG|5.0|I read this book for our September book club meeting.  The author's style of writing sends you back to a former time period.  You actually see Manderlay through the eyes of the narrator.  The eeriness of Mrs. Danvers comes through loud and clear.  Even if you've read this before and seen Alfred Hitchcock's movie, it is still great fun.

B001DHXT1G|4.0|I have been a Hulk fan since I was young, so to me to see the attention to Marvel comics is both exciting and vindicating.  I have both versions of Hulk,  I like Ed Norton's style, but I like the CGI Hulk better in the original.  This Hulk seems dark, like grey Hulk in comic series.  The opening for many sequels is interesting where they are going.  The Blu Ray is the only way to go on these action movies. Great picture, great sound.
1423113381|5.0|A Kid's Review  When their father blows up the Rosetta stone and gets captured by the evil Egyptian god, Set, 12 year-old Sadie and 14 year-old Carter Kane must find a way to save him before Set destroys the world.  Along the way they meet alligator monsters, star spangled women, and many more amazing creatures.  Sadie and Carter discover that they have magical powers and two interesting but dangerous secrets.  In this book it's just one more step to understanding how the Kane family is connected to the House of Life.  The Red Pyramid combines fiction, adventure, and real Egyptian history.  I absolutely loved this book, and  I would say this is a sure thriller for kids ages 9-13 and adults that love action and Rick Riordan's fabulous writing.    -Laura N. Age 9
0307269752|4.0|More readable than hardcore literature, but more refined than Dan Brown.  With 40 million copies sold, a plot summary seems superfluous.  We all know who Lisbeth is and we all love her (or soon will).  She's a hotter, waifish version of House with an unquenchable thirst for justice.  Suffice it to say her background history and chosen mystery (each bound by secretive violence towards women) both unfold at an appropriate pace and conclude in a very satisfying manner for the reader.  (I qualify that statement since dear Lisbeth is anything but satisfied by the last line.)<br /><br />While the mystery is the meat, Mikael's libel/vendetta story is the bread.  His non-mystery story line seems distracting in the beginning, but it eventually dawns on the reader that this is the perfect vehicle to credibly induce someone other than a criminal investigator to take on the Vanger case. Without Mikael's circumstance driving his investigative availability, this is just another crime novel with some occasionally shocking visuals.  With his circumstance in place, the novel is a cleverly-plotted and well-written update of the genre.<br /><br />Other particularly clever writing techniques include the characters' food choices (in nearly every scene), and an acceleration of plot which mirrors Mikael's steadily increasing interest in his sabbatical.  Well-plotted, well-written, and extremely satisfying.  I immediately purchased the next book after finishing this one.
B001EOQWF8|4.0|This is a great movie, cheesy but beautiful, and my son watches it over and over.  But why did we buy the bluray version?  It's agonizingly slow to load and we haven't been interested in any of the features.

0545123283|3.0|I didn't like SHIVER, the first book in Maggie Stiefvater's series, because I thought a few of the plot elements were too convenient and the main characters, Grace and Sam, were too sweet in their romance. However, out of curiosity, I picked up LINGER. I was pleasantly surprised by the world Ms. Stiefvater created.<br /><br />LINGER continues the story of Grace and Sam. Sam, once a werewolf who changed with the drops in temperature, is now human. He is still with his girlfriend, Grace, only now they face the threat of Grace's vapid parents' disapproval of their relationship. The couple speak in terms of being together forever (a play on the upcoming book in the series), which doesn't sit well with her mom and dad. The biggest dilemma is Grace's sudden illness, which is more than it seems.<br /><br />Thrown into the mix is a boy named Cole, who became a wolf to \\"escape\\" his life of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. He's drawn to Grace's friend Isabel, who has some wolf-related secrets of her own, but is determined not to feel anything. Isabel is attracted to Cole but would rather pound sand than admit it to anyone. Their meetings are filled with sarcastic comments and explosive kisses. However, these two wounded people find solace in each others' presences.<br /><br />Told from the four perspectives of these characters, LINGER is a much stronger story than SHIVER. At first I thought it would be confusing, but each person has their own voice. The characterizations are more fleshed out. Grace and Sam are still cutesy but it's not as annoying as it was in the first book; they communicate, they share moments, they enjoy being together. Grace grows up when she stands up to her parents about her relationship with Sam. Sam, however, was in denial at first that there was anything wrong with Grace, which was frustrating. He still writes corny love songs which a recording studio owner deems as good. However, when it comes down to making a tough choice at the end, he grows up and makes it.<br /><br />Isabel, before a stereotype of the cruel, beautiful girl, is surprisingly the voice of reason in the book. She's the one who keeps everyone on track when they go into their dream worlds. She does feed the wolves by her house even though her father shoots them, which I thought was stupid, and she's over the top, loud, and annoying, but when it comes down to it, she's the best character in the story.<br /><br />Cole had some baggage which I couldn't understand. As the son of a genius, he spoke about being under pressure a lot. I didn't sense it; from the way it sounded, it looked like his parents didn't mind what he did. Maybe he blew this out of proportion? Regardless, he found a music group with a ridiculous name and numbs himself up every chance he gets until he meets the other three. He matures beyond his years and also makes a hard choice, but he knows he takes accountability.<br /><br />The end will have you reeling. It was definitely not what I was expecting, but I'm all in. The path through this wood continues with FOREVER, out next year.efore a stereotype of the cruel, beautiful girl, is surprisingly the voice of reason in the book.

B0037QGS0A|4.0|Dr. Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) is suspicious that her husband, college professor David (Liam Neeson), is doing more than flirting with his students.  Given the lack of warmth emanating from her husband and the open disdain of her son, Michael (Max Thieriot), Catherine's best move would be to just pack up and leave.  But instead, she comes up with the bright idea of hiring a call girl, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), to tempt her husband and report back with the details.  Let us just say that things do not go the way Catherine hopes in this erotic thriller.  Catherine is a gynecologist and early on she tells a patient that an orgasm is just a series of muscular contractions.  The statement strikes me as the type of hubris exhibiting by the doomed heroes in Greek tragedies.  The 2009 film begins with a voice over by Chloe, in which she explains how adept she is at giving her customers what they want.  Chloe has as much faith in her abilities as Catherine lacks faith in her husband.  David's character is a minor figure in the story, with his words and actions being inherently ambiguous, so we are always thinking maybe he did but maybe he did not, but the story comes down to the two women (think Alfred Hitchcock's \\"[[ASIN:B0002HOEOY Suspicion]],\\" but with Cary Grant playing a minor character instead of the male lead).  The key question is what does Catherine want out of this test of her husband's fidelity?  Because whatever it is, Chloe is bound and determined to provide it.<br /><br />A strength of the film is that Erin Cressida Wilson, who did the screenplays for \\"[[ASIN:B00008DDSC Secretary]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000NO1XG8 Fur - An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus]],\\" came up with this script from the French film \\"[[ASIN:B000ENC73G Nathalie]].\\"  I have not seen the original, but Wilson has a talent for unusual love relationships, although what we have in \\"Chloe\\" is far and away the most normal one she has tackled to date.  Atom Egoyan (\\"[[ASIN:6305428107 Exotica]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:0780622251 The Sweet Hereafter]]\\") certainly wants viewers to be ahead of Catherine, so there is a sense from early on of waiting for Catherine to catch up before it is too late.  The musical score cues you in that things are darker than they seem.  But what sold me on checking out this movie as soon as it came out on DVD when I saw the trailer was the cast.  In the wake of \\"Mama Mia!\\" it seems Amanda Seyfried is in every other movie, especially if they involve letter writing (i.e., \\"[[ASIN:B0021L8V3Y Dear John]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B002ZG988M Letters to Juliet]]\\"), but there are those who want to see more of her and this movie certainly delivers on that score.  Chloe is the darkest role she has played to date, and it is no surprise at this point that she can hold her own against Moore, whose character you can see shatter just by watching her eyes.<br /><br />It is when Chloe reaches her own breaking point in this film that I start questioning a lot of what is happening.  The Chloe of the end game is decidedly different from the one we first meet and who becomes part of Catherine's secret conspiracy.  As the credits rolled I was going backwards from the end to rethink everything in terms of how things played out, and it did not fit as neatly as I would like it to under the circumstances.  A standard problem in most thrillers and horror movies is that the payoff is never up to the setup, and ultimately that is the case here and I ended up rounding down on \\"Chloe\\" because of the title character's fate.  Still, \\"Chloe\\" is well-written and well-acted adult fare, and there is not much out there these days that can meet that standard.  Although things could have gotten much worse, just keep in mind that this is not a good date movie.622251 The Sweet Hereafter]]\\") certainly wants viewers to be ahead of Catherine, so there is a sense from early on of waiting for Catherine to catch up before it is too late.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Not even sure why I'm writing this review as I notice a couple of weeks after its release, it has 70+ five star reviews!  Who's the party pooper who left a four star review?  However, seeing the film twice now and watching the extra features contained on this DVD last night, I felt the need to chime in and say that this is absolutely a perfect documentary on one of the best bands of all time.    The basics of any good rock documentary are all contained here -- the beginnings of the band, the struggle, the success, the influence on other well-respected musicians, the legacy, etc.  However, at the core of this film and the story of Rush in general is friendship.  What a rarity for a rock band with this long of a career!  Anyone who has seen or read interviews with Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson or Neil Peart over the years knows that these are three individuals that truly like one another, but it really comes across quite beautifully in this film.  Whether it's the scenes of Lee & Lifeson going back to their junior high school and recalling how they took most of their classes together, or if it's the emotional segment of the film discussing Neil Peart's personal tragedies -- you just know that these three guys love one another and that comes before the band.  It almost seems like acrimony goes hand in hand with the biggest bands of all time -- The Beatles, Yes, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, the aborted Zep reunion from a few years back, and the list goes on.  For some reason tho, this has not happened with Rush.  And it may simply come down to that these are three very nice, level-headed gentlemen.  That just also happen to f**king rock.    Anyway this documentary is perfect.  The bonus features are also great, with particular highlights being Geddy Lee's frank discussion on the recording of [[ASIN:B000001ESL Hemispheres]] (probably my favorite Rush album, but seemingly a sore spot for the band) and footage of Lee, Lifeson, and Peart enjoying a dinner together over many bottlesof wine.  Pick this up today!
B0035TUBIE|5.0|I was introduced to Caro Emerald on a radio show where they never specifically spelled out her name so it took awhile to find her album.  Her name is NOT Carol Emmeraux, Carol Emiril, or Carol Emeraude.    She is a great female vocalist with a beautiful voice backed up with excellent musicians.  The tracks are stimulating, interesting, and fun.  A few tracks have a James Bond feel, especially \\"A Night Like This\\", \\"The Other Woman\\", and the guitars on \\"The Lipstick on His Collar\\".    The music is a mix of jazz and hip-hop with a 1930's feel to a few tracks.  Listen to the samples and enjoy.  To hear a sample of her voice, there are a few a capella versions of her songs.    Personal Favorites:  That Man, Just One Dance, Riveria Life, The Other Woman, You Don't Love Me, Stuck, I Know That He's Mine, A Night Like This

B003LAH7MU|1.0|I recently saw Sting on his Symphonicities tour. The show was amazing with great arrangements and a big sound that blended perfectly with the vocals on all but a couple of numbers. I pre-ordered this CD based on the concert. But my advice is to save your money, this CD was disappointing and you should wait until they release a live version of the show.    The songs on the CD are uninspired retreads of the originals where in most cases the orchestra adds very little to the songs. On most songs the orchestra occupies a back seat with an uninspired sound that comes unfortunately close to easy listening on some tracks, or just ordinary on others. The production quality of the CD was also surprisingly poor. On most tracks the vocals are much louder than the background music, which detracts from any hope of symphonic sound. And inexplicably on the Englishman track the backing percussion is the loudest track in the mix which made it unlistenable due to its monotonous and distracting sound. It would be one thing if it was full on sweeping percussion, but this is a tinny metronome sound that grates on you.    The CD is not advertised as live but I was expecting much more energy and a big symphonic sound. Instead you get tracks that add nothing to the original versions and in some cases take a step backwards. Save your money, wait for a live CD, or better yet go see the show. Youtube has an excellent number of live tracks from the concert. I recommend the \\"Morocco 2010\\" concert, they have the best production quality.

B002ZG974M|5.0|Saw the film last week and really enjoyed it. The cinematography was amazing and the premise for the film was outstanding.  This film was refreshing and extremely entertaining.  There is no dialogue throughout only the natural sounds caught on film. I plan on purchasing the film when it comes out on DVD to add to my personal collection.
0307476154|5.0|I loved this book.  It's very fast and brings in a whole new wave of story from the first book.  I loved these characters and it's so great to see how smart they are at finding the truth and exposing the bad guys.  This book and the third in the series go together.  Warning that these are really great books or so I had a very hard time stopping until I had read the very last word.  I don't want to give away any part of the books to spoil it for you.
0307463745|5.0|The book contains not only tips on how you can manage your work or business but it can help you to realize other aspects of your life.  The best book I've read after Aristotle's Ithika Nikomahia.
0307474712|1.0|The book just does not deliver; there are better books and movies of this type. The main character, Dexter's life is one long, never-ending party. His character never grows or fully develops. By the half way point of the book I was hoping he would get a good ass kicking. Sadly it never comes and by the end of the book he does not become the great person he could be. The female character, Emma, grows and develops  along with the story. Emma spends 20 years waiting for Dexter who does not want to leave the party even though everyone has left but him. He only leaves the party because he has set fire to the building not because he wants to.
0618680004|4.0|The God Delusion is for readers who already doubt the existence of God but who are either holding on to a last thread of faith or who are wary to completely leave their faith due to a belief that religion serves a moral benefit for society or a fear of leaving the religion on which they were raised. I'll admit, I first heard about Richard Dawkins through the 2-part episode on South Park.  His idea of a world without religion was intriguing and, always having doubts about the existence of God but afraid of such a world, sought out this book.  The first pages were rather startling.  I had not realized how villainized atheists could be just because they do not believe in supernatural beings.  It is just a viewpoint on the world, it is not hurting anyone.  Those who commit atrocities due to their faith are at least respected for their beliefs even if their acts are condemned.      Richard Dawkins first explains the different views on who God is, including the secularism of the American Founding Fathers and Einstein's often misunderstood idea of religion where \\"God\\" is the set of physical laws that govern the universe and not a supernatural being.  Dawkins, as a professor of science and expert on evolution, takes issue with the assumption that science can have nothing to say about religion because of, what Stephen Jay Gould defined as, the \\"Non-overlapping magisteria areas\\" (i.e. ultimate meaning, and what makes up a moral life).  In other words, science is supposed to handle the questions of \\"how,\\" but the questions of \\"why\\" are left to theology.    Dawkins then explains why it is certain God does not exist.  Of course, this is a very difficult subject to grasp and, I'll admit, the Boeing 747 analogy is hard for me to comprehend but, what I did take away from this chapter is that natural selection is not something that occurred by chance but is a very long process that breaks down the complexity of life into smaller, more probable pieces.  Divine creationism, by contrast, achieves all the complexity of the world and its species at one fell swoop. Still, he maintains that if an example of \\"irreducible complexity\\" were found, it would wreck Darwin's theory but also destroy intelligent design (pg. 125).  But wouldn't such a discovery play into the hands of those championing intelligent design?  That point aside, what started the process of natural selection is still unclear to me, but no less clear than the question of who or what created the creator.      An evolutionary look at why humans are susceptible to religion is offered next and is followed by eye-opening chapters on the perceived benefits and actual ill-effects of religion.  Do we need religion to teach us right from wrong, give us a charitable nature, and establish our sense of morality?  Dawkins insists that modern morality is not founded on religious doctrine.  The sections of The God Delusion that were the most revealing to me were the ones dealing with the problems religion (and not just the radical kind) brings to society.  There is the obvious wars, violence and killings, but also the in-group mentality, the discouragement of questioning and thus placing anything unknown under the default answer of God instead of seeking solutions through experimentation and research, the resources, time and energy put into religion that could be used for other things, the dependence on the existence of God to bring meaning to one's life, and the indoctrination of children.  Surprisingly, Dawkins believes the Catholic Church is unfairly demonized regarding the pedophile issue and finds a more pressing cause for concern with the church's attempts to scare children with stories of hell.     Some liberties are taken in this book.  Dawkins assumes the American Founding Fathers would be atheists if they lived today.  He remarks that Gould did not mean what he wrote in \\"Rock of Ages\\" which put forth the NOMA idea (why did he write it if he did not mean it?).  Some sections of the book area little difficult to understand, especially those concerning \\"memes\\" (cultural variants) and I am not sure where Dawkins was going with the section on \\"religious education as part of literary culture\\" which lists phrases taken from scripture that are used in literature and conversational English.  Otherwise, I found The God Delusion well-written, easy to grasp for the most part, fair and inspiring.  It has given me more confidence in my beliefs, especially concerning the fearful revelation that \\"if God does not exist, this life is it.\\"  The back of the book includes a directory to support groups for those struggling with the fears and doubts of religion.
B001DJLCRC|3.0|I was really blown away by the first few episodes of this, which would have made a heart-pounding (and self-contained) movie in their own right.<br /><br />But as the show wore on (especially in the second season), its attempts to create tension began to feel more and more artificial until they were simply transparent.  A good example of this would be the actions of Tuco, who would never have risen to be the don of a little crime empire had he been so hotheaded.<br /><br />It seems like after blowing their initial wad, the writers had nothing left but simple cliff-hanging suspense, which they didn't scruple to resort to even in minor scenes.  By the end of the second season, this was the only merit the show could boast.  It got so predictable.  It was as if as soon as things were cooling off, one character would start acting irrationally merely so that there wouldn't be a letup.  At one point in the second season, Jesse asks Walt, \\"6 grand a day we're making!  What's your problem?!\\"  I'd love it if Walt had said:  \\"Hey, I have to have some sort of problem to keep the tension up in the script!\\"<br /><br />How long do they think they can go on with this premise?  I imagine the show by the tenth season, Walt, at 80, never quite succumbing to cancer, Jesse, middle-aged now with a family, the two of them having escaped detection by a hair's breadth a thousand times over the course of four decades . . .
030726999X|5.0|Loved this one too.  This ties the whole story together and yes it is a great ending.  These characters work so well together and the story is so clever.  There is also a bunch of new characters that all try to piece the mystery together with bits of information coming from very different places.  I'm not going to give the story away because watching it unfold it what's so great.  Loved this.  Now I can get some sleep.
B00371QQ0M|1.0|This disk will not play on my 18 month old Blue ray player.  Only disk I have ever had this problem with.  Sent one back to Amazon and got another and it does the same thing.  Boots up and shows me the top menu, but can't get it to play the movie - no matter which way I start play I get the studio's logo sequence and then it just stops. Frustrating.  I have a feeling they just got too cute with their on-line tie-ins and players without most recent firm-ware updates won't play it.

0307341577|2.0|How this book got the praise it did is beyond me. At least it is better than her Sharp Objects - which was a disaster. This is a good book from the start, and then goes terribly bad.
B0037272K4|5.0|An album that I would put at the same level as some of the greatest ever made. Asaf Avidan has one of the greatest voices you will ever hear and a style so fresh, original and unique. I can't put this disk down! On another note... I've seen them live... must see!
B001QOGYFY|2.0|Man, this was one, long tedious movie.  You've probably read all the other criticsms, and I agree with them.  I gave it two stars instead of one because (1) it had the semblance of a plot, and (2) I was surprised toward the end as to who the bad guy was.  I also liked the \\"heck with physics\\" part:<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER! POSSIBLE SPOILER!<br /><br />You're after a guy who is trying to escape by plane.  You get there, and he's gone: somehow he got by you and was headed back from whence you came.  Reminds me of an MST-3K laugher (Wild Rebels), when the cops set up a roadblock but somehow forgot about one of the roads (easily seen by anyone).  How did that guy get past them?<br /><br />OK, I'm going to mention the nudity part.  What in the heck did that add to the plot?  Why is it this young lady straps on a gun but would rather run from someone than use it? Does she have no hand-to-hand combat training?  And the whining...
B003RNU8KY|5.0|I'm not much of a music analyst, but I picked this up at a local music store on a whim--had heard some of The Roots earlier--and I was not disappointed. A great, undulating album with great music and lyric. I've heard it all through  a bunch of times and keep discovering.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|I am fond of this film, and I highly recommend this movie to those who wish to head-on challenge their sensibilities. Also, those who wish to think. The major content of this movie is a real slap in the face, but it's important to understand the underlying allegory, which I'm not as well-equipped as others to explain. Maybe read more about it in warning, then keep the most open mind possible.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Here is another short and sweet review so here goes. A amazing album I can't stop lisiting to this album. A punk rock opera is a very good discription of the album. There are plenty of brilliant songs. Turn this album up and enjoy.
0307266303|5.0|I ordered this book and it arrived very quickly. I read it in one day - it was a relly good book and grabbed your attention immediately.     If you are a runner at any level this is a great read.
0812550706|5.0|Without giving away details of the plot...  With so many teenagers getting involved in save-the-world video games, this book is very likely to fill their sci-fi fantasies:  Reading this book, you live the life of a young boy who develops into such a saviour for humanity.  But the hero doesn't develop into this role out of choice, but by having circumstance bring out his natural abilities.  And it's not all glory.  There are, of course, trials and tribulations, but, in addition to this, you experience the personal struggles, coping, and contemplation of the hero.  This book indirectly provides much food for deep thought about important issues, including personal and humanity issues.<br />  But most importantly, it's a fantastic read.  It's intriguing -- in terms of the suspense of what will develop next or what will be the outcome of this -- and the pace is quick -- it's not the sort of suspense that develops slowly.  The author does an excellent job of conveying his meaning very clearly, such that in your mind's eye you will have a good vision for what is going on.  It's so vivid and captivating that it seems that you yourself are in the author's skin in each situation.<br />  Whether you are a teenager or want to relive the experience of boyhood/teenhood (or are looking for a good book for your teen to read), I highly recommend that you add this to your reading list!<br />  And if you also enjoy this book, I recommend reading Ender's Shadow and the Shadow of the Hegemon, too.  In these books you relive the story, but through the eyes of two of the other characters.  Yet, each book is considerably different.  In this way, these three books make these works a unique contribution to literature.  All three are well worth reading.
B002VECMAE|5.0|Along the same vein as \\"Brother where art thou?\\", the Coen brothers humor is evidenced masterfully in this film. Starts out slowly, but don't give up---it's priceless! Great service from the seller.
B000MZHW4A|5.0|Even if you don't like Leonardo Di Caprio you will like this, it's one of the best films I've ever seen. It's gripping, relistic and based on a true story. It's shocking, informative and intresting all at the same time. It's well acted and has a brilliant storyline. Even thou it has a sad story and a point to make, it dosn't get in the way of making this an enjoyable and brilliant film.
B002QGSW8I|4.0|Looking for a good book that is a real page turner for the beach? Need some \\"escapism\\" reading? This book is just the ticket! Not great literature but a darn good story. The entire Sigma Force is gathered again to stop the bad guys from destroying the world. Rollins still churns out a decent plot and good dialog. A bit predictable in parts, the book really never slows its pace and all in all is good pablum after a hard week at work. If you like espionage and intrigue, this is the book to pick up and lose yourself in Painter Crowe's world.
0525423842|4.0|I picked this latest Grisham book up after hearing about it on a local radio station. It is a wonderful and quick read for adults although it is targeted for teenagers. (Our 14-year-old son, a speed reader, finished it off in just two nights.) It lacks some of the details of Grisham's adult legal thrillers but it certainly holds ones attention and actually made me crack a few smiles despite its serious subject matter. We can't wait for the next in the series and the movie! These books have the potential of becoming as popular as the Harry Potter series. (P.S. Among other things, this kid lawyer explains how court rooms operate and how mortgages/reposessions work in terms that everyone can understand.) If you have a budding lawyer in your family or are a lawyer(s) with children, this is a must read.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I was very disappointed with the ZAGG protector. I'v had several screen protectors on my gear that use different  film technologies. Some are more brittle and shiney, some are more rubbery.  This one may claim it protects and comes with replaceable waranty, but it makes my new iPhone 4 look and feel like a cheep toy. VERY GOOEY-RUBBERY finish that smudges and gets sticky and is hard to clean. I couldnt stand it after 3 days removed it. Ordered the Stealth Guards. Less money and WAYYY better technology. Phone looks and feels great.
B00005RFVL|5.0|This is a brilliant album, this is not your typical Robbie Williams. He changes his genre here and does a great job of it. Ok it's not Frank Sinatra but it's a combination of him and Robbie and that makes for an amazing album. Im finding it difficult to do a long review here so I sum it up in short and all you need to know is its brilliant and a combination of the best bits of Frank and Robbie. Just buy it.<br />Bare in mind if your a true swing fan and a true fan of big bands or Frank Sinatra you probably wont like this (or at least as much I did). Just remember this is a repackging of the songs for a different market and a combination of the artist I've mentioned already.
1575666286|5.0|I have a Netflix account.  Saw The Beautiful Truth and later the Gerson Miracle.  Had a lump in my throat that was literally choking me when I ate.  Bought the book, started juicing.  I can swallow most of the time now and hope to be cured in time (been a month or so).      I've been a pretty healthy guy who's been into athletics and health for a long time.  In the past 7 years I've developed bad habits.  With the combination of the Gerson method and exercise, I feel better now than in a long time.  Used to run 3-5 miles a day.  Just started again...feeling healthy enough to do so.  Blood pressure has dropped w/ out meds also (from 154/114 to 127/68 the other day).  Cravings for juice and feeling good are stronger than any drug I've taken in the past.  You honestly feel kind of light headed/high on life.  Maybe that's the way we are supposed to feel.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This CD has replace AmeriKKKas Most Wanted as my all time favorite hip-hop CD. I am soo glad NAS didn't completely sell his soul but actually put out a CD in the manner that hip-hop was intended to be. I am not just giving it 5-stars for the fact that it is politically correct the CD is extremely full of fire. The production, beats and lyrics flow in harmony on each track. Every song speaks to you in a powerful manner and leaves you with something great. This is what Black music was intended to be. Damian Marley honestly surprised me in his ability to spit and on some songs he seemed to be taking over with his lyrical flow. \\"Nas may have cemented his spot as the greatest rapper ever with this one.\\" This was a excellent choice for Nas as they both switched out rapping before you could tire of either one of them. You can still feel the New York street aggressiveness in Nas but the knowledge/desire for progress is the strongest vibe coming from him. Damian is just deep and can let is thoughts fall out on wax naturally. Best CD of the decade by far.<br /><br />THE BADDD---<br />They raised the bar in hip-hop! Listened to Paper Trail a recent favorite and it all of a sudden wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was, it was just too far behind the quality of Distant Relatives to be able to be enjoyed.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have read this series four times, and i can honestly say it's the best book I've ever read. I know you don't care about much else, but honesly, READ THIS BOOK!
B000002UDB|5.0|A brilliant album with magical Mystery Tour I am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry fields Forever, Penny Lane and all you need is love. It's a amazing album. The fool on the hill and Baby your a rich man are also ok but a bit dissapinted with the rest. Still good album I think there best but don't mark me down for that. For those songs I don't like mark it down half a point which makes 4 and half byt I know this is harsh but I round down. Still a brillant album Buy it
030726999X|4.0|A word of warning- the Millennium Series isn't one you want to read out of order.<br /><br />I'm going to miss these characters, now that I've finished this book, the last in the series.<br /><br />For some reason, this book got off to a slow start for me, which didn't happen with the previous books. I didn't dislike it, but it didn't compel me to keep going as much as I expected.<br /><br />I think not having an unknown bad guy and Salander being out of  action due to her injuries from the end of the previous book weighed the story down- it felt more like logistics (interesting ones) than a mystery.<br /><br />As the book progressed, the plots deepened, Salander got back in the game in spite of being arrested, isolated, and having a hole in her head,  I got pulled back into the lives of all the characters, and the story became as compelling as ever.<br /><br />Hornet's Nest has a somewhat different flavor from the previous two books. There's international intrigue which was introduced in the second book, but grows deeper and more political here, and there's the added dimension of a courtroom drama.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's still the hunt for the big news story, lots of excitement, drama, violence, and the computer hacking that played a part in the previous books.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist still gets on my nerves at times, particularly when all the women in the book are falling in love with him, but it isn't a big problem, and the other characters (and most of the other aspects of Blomkvist) are interesting and well put together.<br /><br />If you've read the other books, you'll want to continue with this one.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|The movie came quickly to my house and in pristine condition. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B001A7X0XG|1.0|Received only one disk.  Loaded it in the computer DVD player.  Activated the digital download.  Never got asked for the code, but after approximately three minutes of appearing to download the file a message displayed that says the digital copy is expired.  I tried to find the movie to play.  There isn't one.  Basically this is a rip off.  [[ASIN:B001A7X0XG Ultraviolet (+ Digital Copy)]]
B001MV49HG|5.0|will go as far as saying the best album of all time. But what ever happens it is the Top 5 albums of all time. All the songs are worthy of being singles and they all could have been top 10.<br />Another well written album with brilliant songs. They are all amazing.<br />Before I go over the top with credit I just say you won't be dissapointed with this album. Buy it.
0307278255|5.0|Unaccustomed Earth is a collection of beautifully written stories about an interesting collection of characters. Some of them come and go in just one story, others come back throughout the book.<br /><br />I was amazed at how well I could get to know the people in the space of one story, probably because they were so character-centric.<br /><br />All of the stories look at the experience of people of Indian descent- usually featuring the children of immigrants, balancing the traditions of their parents with the current reality of their life in America. There is also a recurring theme of infidelity and broken marriage and the end of relationships, looked at from many different angles. There is the more general question of growing up and breaking away from your family (or having them break from you).<br /><br />The themes are universal, and the biggest problem with the book was leaving behind each set of characters.
1595825045|5.0|I really enjoyed the cartoon series, and when I saw they had published an art book I bought it! This book is full of character sketches, facial studies, background on the story and character development, and fun side notes about the creation process. I really enjoyed reading about the Kung Fu sketch studies, and the swamp benders. I recommend this book if you enjoyed the story/cartoon, and would like to know more about the 'behind the scenes.'
B001NESPHC|5.0|From what I've read, Melody Gardot knows a lot about life for someone so young, and it shows in the music.  Deep, calming and classy. Glad I bought it.
B000000OA6|5.0|The album starts of the 90's with style and should be counted as one of the best Queen albums and up there with the best of the decade. Innuendo goes from the fast, upbeat Headlong to the slow and Poignant These Are The Days Of Our Lives. There are a few sadder song which is understandable, but that helps it make it a great album. Apart from the great songs from the Greatest Hits II which most people know about. There are plenty of other good songs that stand out , like I Can't Live With You, Don't Try So Hard, The Hitman and Ride The Wild Wind which could help make a Greatest Hits IV album.<br />This is an enjoyable album and a must have.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|I liked this movie. I've watched all Michael Moore movies and, by now, I was gettin a little tired with his one-dimension remarks. He was extremely radical in denouncing other radicals, if you knwo what I mean. One side only.<br /><br />In this one, he's a little bit more moderate, although still going for the jugular. In the end, what I perceive is that capitalism is not an evil; but to let capitalism live without ANY form of regulation by the government is suicide.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|I have this on vinyl, but I have played it so often that the grooves are worn through. I was thrilled to get this on CD as it is not easily available in Australia. Every one of the numbers on this is a gem, the vocals, the music; it's Moody Blues at its best.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin is on a mission to free people from the false implied contract current leadership boxes them into. In this, he is exactly right.<br /><br />How has the nature of work changed? What has happened to the implied agreement where workers do what they are told and are protected from the difficult work of thinking? Finally, what are WE to do?<br /><br />Godin dives into these meaty questions with a seasoned perspective that both clarifies and sounds a call to action.<br />Godin's book is directed to the individual, to the person frustrated by the current state of affairs. It could just as easily be directed to the \\"bosses,\\" those people who are using a leadership structure that is living on borrowed time, who are ham-stringing their employees and causing significant costs in terms of employee turn-off and lack of intellectual commitment. Gallup estimated that employee dis-engagement costs American businesses $300 billion a year.<br /><br />It is a timely book and we add Seth Godin to those business thinkers who recognize the current leader-follower arrangement just isn't working, and are calling for changes.<br /><br />We take Godin's point one step further. We do not believe a patch on the current leader-follower leadership structure will solve the problem; the better way to think of it is that it is the leader-follower structure itself that is the problem. Instead, replace leader-follower with leader-leader, rejecting the notion that we should put anyone into a follower role!<br /><br />Let's not lose the best of our intellectual capability by putting people into follower roles.<br /><br />My name is David Marquet, from Practicum, Inc and we help our customers get everyone be a leader and avoid casting employees into follower roles.

B000025KL3|5.0|A brilliant rock album and there's lot's billiant songs on there that didn't make it on to the Gretest Hits album and enough to make a good contribution to a Greatest Hits IV. Now I'm Here and Killer Queen are the best tracsk but most of the others are really good and enjoyable. Apart from naming all the songs I like because I think's a waste of time and most of them are very good. So the main reasons you should buy it is it's one of the best albums they made and as I said there's lot's of other good songs that are not in the Greatest Hit's albums.
1441866868|3.0|I'm not an avid listener of audio books, but I've heard a few before.  I have found some to be highly engaging and well read.  Others are dry and monotonous.  The Windup Girl fell somewhere in between, it's an unabridged reading so it's very long. That's not a complaint. I think unabridged is the way to go in most, if not all, cases. But the reader just isn't that interesting to listen to, unfortunately. Maybe I have a shorter attention span than I thought, but I just kept losing interest throughout. Though it should be pointed out that the reader, Johnathan Davis, is quite experienced.     There is an introduction by the author included, talking about the inspiration for the novel - a nice touch to add to the package.    The idea of a \\"windup girl\\" or what the book calls \\"New People\\", is interesting.  They are artificial, and basically created to be like concubines.  They wind up as sort of homeless beings after being discarded.  The whole sci-fi angle of this story is a guy looking for food in a future where calories are treated like money.  Post apocolyptic stuff, with the apocalypse in this case being biological disease epidemics.      Maybe I just can't handle nearly 20 hours of hard, heavy, science-fiction.  I'm more of a Star Trek or Doctor Who kind of guy, I am not really into the more serious side of the genre.  It's not that I don't respect it - I just don't really \\"get it\\" sometimes.  And that was the case with The Windup Girl.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|I am glad that I'm finally able to share Miyazaki's animated features (well, some of them at least) with my five-and-a-half year old daughter. She fell head-over-heels in love with Totoro, the adorable, giant forest spirit in [[ASIN:B002ZTQV8Y My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], and has requested repeated viewings since we first watched the movie together last week! I then introduced her to [[ASIN:B002ZTQVLG Kiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVD]] which proved to be another hit, and yesterday, we watched \\"Ponyo\\" for the first time.<br /><br />My daughter liked \\"Ponyo\\" though she was not as enraptured with it as she was with Totoro (she did not request a repeat viewing like she did with Totoro). The storyline is interesting enough, though it is reminiscent of The Little Mermaid. A little fish named Ponyo (looking a lot like a little girl) lives in her father's underwater kingdom with thousands of other fish siblings. A misadventure puts her in the path of a little boy named Sosuke, and the pair bond almost instantly. This close connection proves to be a key element in the plot as when Ponyo gets separated from her mortal boy, she does all she can to get back to him, causing imbalance in the two worlds in the process. The rest of the story focuses on what happens to the pair and how everything is resolved.<br /><br />I loved the colors and the fantastic imagery and animation. There is an abundance of vivid imagery and my young daughter was captivated by what was happening on screen. Ponyo as a character has a lot going for her - she is adorable and young children can easily relate to her precocious nature. The plot does get a tad confusing in parts if only because there is so much going on in the story, but in general, the story flows well. I still prefer \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" (note: this does center on a young \\"witch\\") over \\"Ponyo\\", but if you're looking for engaging children's animated features (ages 5 and up), you can't go wrong with these three. They are also the best bet for younger children in Miyazaki's range of animated features as some of the others can be rather dark for younger viewers.), you can't go wrong with these three.

B0006399FS|5.0|This is the 1st U2 album I bought and I'm wasb't disappointed. Some brilliant rock songs on this like Vertigo, Miracle Drug, Fast Cars and Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own. All the songs on here are really good. I can't compare it to older U2 albums but compared to other U2 songs and other rock albums this is up there and a must have
B0000DBJDM|2.0|I think by far the best version of this film was the 1974 theatrical release, which included scenes from the making of Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios.  The 2003 director's cut (the only version available on DVD) is a terribly jarring and distracting cut, with goof-ball space cartoons randomly tossed in continually throughout the original performance.<br /><br />The only saving grace is that it includes the original 1972 film under the \\"features\\" section.  The director's cut is NOT worth watching.<br /><br />I can only hope and pray that they will eventually release this on blu-ray, and when they do, include a remastered version of both the 1972 and 1974 films.
0545123283|5.0|In the last weeks of winter, Sam has stayed human, much to Grace's joy, but the cold still haunts him. Grace is just happy to be with him, even though she knows that their problems are far from resolved. As spring approaches, the new wolves are changing back, even though one of them, Cole, would like nothing more than to lose himself in his wolf form, and Isabel's father is more than willing to help eradicate the wolves in the forest completely. And through it all, Grace is keeping a secret, something that could change everything.<br /><br />Linger is a beautiful, elegant, and searing sequel. It contains all of the drama and romance of Shiver, but also possesses a new urgency as secrets are kept and tensions rise. Linger opens up Sam and Grace's world to include Cole and Isabel as narrators, and divulges even more about the wolves and how they live. Stiefvater reveals some wonderful character growth for each of the four narrators as well; Sam is still trying to get used to the fact that he is fully human and has a future ahead of him. Grace is feeling the stress of keeping secrets from her parents and Sam and her anger at her parents' constant absences. Sharp-tongued Isabel suffers from guilt at her part in her brother's death, and even though she'd like to stay away from the wolves, she can't help but be drawn to Cole, a sardonic boy who chose to be a wolf to escape the problems in his human life, but is finding that being a wolf is actually making him confront the things he has tried to bury. These issues that force the characters to evolve keep Linger from seeming like a transition from Shiver to the next book, and give it enough drama and tension to keep you rapt, especially during the climactic final scenes when Sam, Grace, Isabel, and Cole realize that the inner workings of lycanthropy may not be quite as they thought.<br /><br />Stiefvater's writing is breathtakingly beautiful, as precise and affecting as poetry, and Linger is emotional, heartbreaking, and heart-pounding as the stakes are subtly raised for not just the main characters, but for every wolf in Mercy Falls.the stakes are subtly raised for not just the main characters, but for every wolf in Mercy Falls.
1594202559|5.0|Inverting Franklin Roosevelt \\"...investors should fear the lack of fear itself\\". This is just one insight Sebastian Mallaby gives us in `More Money Than God'. In fact, he gives a nuts and bolts feel for Hedge Funds, their history and the people - the masters of the universe - who operate them. It is a history of leverage, short selling and size characterized by major success and catastrophic failure.<br /><br />Strangely, it also gives the small investor an insight into the share market. Is the market efficient? Can the market be beaten? If the market is not `efficient', hedge funds (and the small investor) can be successful. But sadly for an ongoing hedge fund, success removes the imperfections that it was profitably exploiting. \\"Sooner or later, every great investor's edge is destined to unravel\\" and often \\"quant brainiacs follow their computers to a well-deserved doom\\" because \\"the rocket scientists had blown up their rockets\\".<br /><br />Success means a flood of money into the hedge fund. But \\"an analyst might identify a promising small company and figure that its value could double over three years, but if there were only $20 million worth of shares available to buy, it was hardly worth bothering with.\\" Not so for the small investor, but then again the hedge funds seem to be able to short sell flexibly at will - a facility that should democratically be available to the small investor.<br /><br />Starting in the 1990's, hedge funds became large enough to move markets of all kinds. They could even overpower governments. This allowed the Tiger Fund in 1998 to approach \\"Russian friends...to buy the entire stock of nongold precious metals held by the central bank and finance ministry...take the palladium, the rhodium, and the silver. All of it.\\" leaving the logistics problem of getting it into a Swiss bank with Tiger's name on it.<br /><br />For the small investor there is sound advice:<br /><br />- it is often dangerous to trade on statistical evidence unless it can be intuitively explained\\". \\"Visceral\\" is the word meaning deep inward feelings rather than just an intellectual focus.<br /><br />- \\"The whole point of leverage, the very definition of the term, is that investors feel ripples of the economy in a magnified way.\\"<br /><br />- We all rationalize success. One position by the Chanos Fund only worked out because the April 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstration broke out. This earned the comment \\"The way Ah see it, is that it took a revolution of a bihl-lion people for your darn short to work out.\\"<br /><br />- \\"Event driven\\" investing at Farallon Fund specialized in predicting events that cause existing prices to be wrong e.g. takeover announcements, demergers, avoiding bankruptcy, meeting banking covenants, major economic events, hybrid security maturity dates etc.<br /><br />- `Pattern investing' used by the Medallion fund looking for patterns in the market. This applies research on French/English translation where the computer finds the grammatical rules not the programmer (using the Canadian Hansard which is conveniently in both languages).<br /><br />- A Tiger Fund manager \\"should manage the portfolio aggressively, removing good companies to make way for better ones; should avoid risking more than 5 percent of capital on more than one bet; and should keep swinging through bad times until luck returned\\".<br /><br />- Remember that \\"...the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\\".<br /><br />- \\"If one of these stocks fell ... it was probably being pushed by an institutional block trader that needed to raise cash...the price would soon revert, creating an opportunity to profit.\\" In other words, why is the seller selling?<br /><br />- \\"the biggest danger for buyers of illiquid assets is that in a crisis these assets will collapse the hardest.\\"<br /><br />- \\"...the larger an investment fund, the harder it was for a fund manager to generate returns\\" meaning the small investor has more opportunity.<br /><br />- And remember, \\"LTCM calculated that this loss should have occurred less than once in the lifetime of the universe. But it happened anyway.\\" The market does not follow a normal distribution; often it is not random; but then is it often predictable?<br /><br />Mallaby grapples with the variety of thought behind the success of the hedge funds giving us a workmanlike insight. This attempt to describe how the hedge funds actually operate - as far as he is able (and he tells us when he cannot) - makes this a valuable book indeed.br />- And remember, \\"LTCM calculated that this loss should have occurred less than once in the lifetime of the universe.

B002HREKCI|5.0|My friend practically begged me to read this novel. Although it took a few pages, soon I was completely hooked. It grabbed me in such a powerful way. Halfway through, I was carrying it everywhere, determined to learn more about Hannah Baker and her suicide. In a way, the reader becomes Clay Jensen. My emotions became entwined with his, as we slowly watched the downfall of this lovely human being. This book is not for the light of heart - it's raw and honest. There is no overwhelmingly happy ending, or catharsis.    Thirteen Reasons Why should be required reading, at least for middle schoolers. This novel is important. It reflects what happens when people slip through the cracks of society. In my high school, a couple students committed suicide over the four years I attended. This novel made me realize how much I wish I could have helped, how much I didn't know. The idea of others coming across this realization from reading this novel expresses how much others should give it a try.      Hannah Bakers's experiences are conveyed in such a stunning and heartbreaking method, it's impossible not to relate, or feel for her as she steadily records the ways her life began to disintegrate. And how nobody did anything to stop the downfall. Entertaining, gripping, and extremely painful, this book makes for the perfect emotional read.     You won't be disappointed.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you don't enjoy this series, then odds are you are not a Sci Fi fan. It has great characters, great story lines, complex relationships, cool visuals. The only negative is that they canceled it way too soon. I would highly recommend watching the series and the follow up movie Serenity.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Pretty much impressive how a book can teach u tons of fresh ideas, based and real people´s life, showing u expereiences u probable struggle with every day or perhaps every once in a while. I loved the book, how  simply  it makes u get the point, no distractions involved.  Perfect to keep in ur iphone, kindle, ipad or whethever u use to keep urself bussy when ur not.
B003JYOFIW|3.0|Devo is back, and surprisingly good! The sound on this album is very reminiscent of both New Traditionalists and Total Devo (with a touch of Shout). If you're a Devo fan, that's probably an odd statement -- because those two couldn't have sounded more dissimilar. And that's why sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />The standout songs on this album are BRILLIANT. \\"Fresh\\" is old-school Devo with some newer production. \\"Please Baby Please\\" blends about a dozen different musical styles into a single, unified whole. And \\"Later is Now\\" is their new \\"Beautiful World.\\" Unfortunately, not all the songs are standouts. Most of the others are decently crafted and enjoyable to listen to, but a handful are simply uninspired, and one (\\"No Place Like Home\\") sounds like Devo deciding to do a Motley-Crue-style piano ballad -- and yes, that's just as horrifying as it sounds.<br /><br />This is definitely a good album. (And to me, \\"Good\\" is 3 stars. I save 4 and 5 for \\"Great\\" and \\"Excellent.\\") The standout songs MORE than compensate for the few misses. If it's still on sale when you read this, it's a steal -- GET IT. If it's back to full price, then I'd take a moment to mull it over. If you liked Devo's older stuff, but still enjoyed what they did on their later (post-Alan) albums, you'll enjoy this quite a bit.
B0015DROBO|5.0|At first I had trouble following the charactaers and story line but 1/4 into it I was rolling.  A wonderful story.  Very original and I hated it to end.

0399156577|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  First she wrote outside the box in comparision to most of her books.  I liked all her characters.  They were closer to real, both Fiona and  Simon were strong in themselves and where they stood in the realationship. I laughed  with how they viewed where the relationship was going especialy with Simon.  Fiona had already gone thru the trama of being taken and almost killed, losing her boyfriend, and getting past it to become who she is today.  I liked that Nora Roberts didn't go thru the kidnapping, attack, then saving of Fiona.  We have enough of that in too many books, it gets old.  The dogs gave the book a new depth.  You learned a great deal of what it takes to work with people and dogs. Not only in obeidence but search and rescue.  She gave the strength to her main character not the serial killers.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've read since the trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  I loved the point of view from Enzo (the dog) and I fell in love with Denny.  I was never bored, there was always a twist when you thought you had the story all figured out.  At the end I was sitting on my bed crying and my two dogs were right there by my side to comfort me.  I was completely satisfied with the ending too.  Read this book, you will not be disappointed.  I would have given it six stars if I could!
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I love Natalie Merchant's voice, and this new album is simply fantastic. An in addition to the songs, there is a massive insert booklet discussing the works that she used as inspiration. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.
B001993Y2C|5.0|as with every one else I to was not fond of the disc sleeve holders to bland for such a nice no wait GREAT collection I don't need to explain the premise of this series. one of The best defintive scifi shows of this generation not since the x-files(or lost for that matter) has a series moved me and shook my senses until blood dripped out of my ears. all in all this Blu-ray collection is a must have for any scifi or drama fan of great thought provoking writing. the price alone is well justified to pick this one up....So say We all!
1417068329|5.0|Brick is a not a film as much as a symphony where each instrument is tuned to the beat of the conductor. Each frame is carefully orchestrated and composed to perfection. The dialogue is metered and spoken with a contemporary Shakespearean beat. Writer/Director Rian Johnson has created poetry with his first feature length film. It may be tough to understand the lingo and overall speech used, but as the film advances you begin to know the characters and the words just make complete sense.    We open with the stare of our protagonist--hard and piercing, yet on the verge of tears--eyes slowly welling up as he peers down on a motionless body, facedown in a tunnel's steady, flowing stream. This is film noir at its best: wrong men and notorious women. Our leader into this underbelly of society has recently rolled on his boss to skate clean of a drug deal he was involved with. The cops allow this plea and decide to keep him in their pocket, with what happened as leverage. He stays low, nose clean, until an old love brings him into her world as it's spiraling out of control. Using all his resources around the city, he begins his search to find her and make sure she is OK. He does this for his own means, with a stoicism that hearkens back to Bogart's Sam Spade.    Wait...Did I tell you that the city this is set in is a suburban high school? Johnson has flipped the genre on its head to brilliant effect. Brendan, our medium into the story, is played to perfection by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a senior at the school who has alienated himself by ratting on his drug supplier. The vice-principal is using him to gain intel on the dealings around school, but Brendan will have none of it. He needs to find out what happened to his old flame Emily and see what she got involved in. Enlisting the help of a colleague, Brendan plays his enemies off each other to gain access to the mob boss and dope runner The Pin (\\"I hear he's supposed to be old, like 26\\"), whom Emily has wronged. The truth must be found at all costs, either to assuage some personal guilt, to rescue love, to do what's right, to get the bad guys, or maybe all the above. The search for answers leads to betrayal and secrets uncovered and I was there for the entire ride.    Brick is not the 21st century's answer to Alan Parker's Bugsy Malone. This isn't a satire on mob life with children playing men. This is a reawakening of the genre, a subversion of what you expect of it, but played straight as a razor. None of these actors break character and lines like this, echoing a hardened criminal telling off an over-zealous officer, \\"No more of these informal chats! If you have a disciplinary issue with me, write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the Parent-Teacher conference,\\" are delivered with straight faces and a piercing confidence. The wit is there and you will laugh to the seeming absurdity, but the weight of the story holds strong. Well-placed humor helps you realize the gravity of everything even more.    Levitt shines in the role and proves to be the best up-and-coming actor of his generation. Following pitch-perfect turns as a violent teen in the wonderful Manic and as a teenage hustler, vagrant in Gregg Araki's disturbing yet unforgettable Mysterious Skin, Levitt is making bold choices and continues a great run with Brick. He is flanked with solid support from \\"Lost's\\" Emilie de Ravin as his lost love; Lukas Hass as The Pin, with loyalty straying muscle Noah Fleiss; Matt O'Leary's The Brain, Brendan's life-line to what's happening as he sinks deeper; and Nora Zehetner flawlessly playing the femme fatale which one can never be sure whether to trust. Also, the accompanying score of piano and brass jazz fits perfectly to the atmosphere, especially on a late scene close-up shot of Levitt and Zehetner--faces close- up, lips with an atom of air between them, and a single tear slowly following down the contours of her face--uncannily mimicking the infamous shot of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca.    Any cinephile with $8 to spend will regret missing an opportunity to see this film. If you love film noir of the 50's, 60's, and 70's check Brick out while you can. Doubtful that it will stay up more than 2 or 3 weeks, it will be coming to DVD on August 8th, however go out and see this gem. It will not be everyone's cup of tea, but whether you love it or not, it holds a place on the timeline of cinema as an experiment in stripping down the essence of noir and showing it in a new and no longer angelic world of children on the cusp of adulthood. \\"Here's looking at you kid.\\"

B000BMHVSQ|4.0|\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Ernest Hemingway was published in 1926, when he was just 27 years old and it was his first major novel. The expatriot American community in Paris and Europe in general after World War II brought together a band of talented writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, whose famous quote \\"You are all a lost generation\\" is listed at the front of Hemingway's work and whose talents are later criticized by Hemingway in other writings. This first effort by the young Hemingway was noteworthy at the time as it was a bold, new style, clean, terse, abrupt and different from that being released by other novelists. Thus Hemingway first gained attention as a writer worth following.     The book is a story of the daily lives of several \\"lost\\" people, including Jake Barnes and the incredibly beautiful, sexy Lady Brett Ashley, who every man desires and who has slept with nearly all of them. The plot literally revolves around three things- drinking, eating and various love affairs or near affairs of the main characters. You get a sense that Hemingway was both a participant and a curious bystander seeing this display of drunken debauchery, lewd behavior and wasteful spending of money...yet he somehow stands apart from the crowd in that he senses that things aren't right, things are going badly and that at some point, this type of behavior will cause all of them to fall into the abyss, which many of them later did...     If you read this novel, you truly MUST read the later Hemingway, as he develops his writing skills magnificently over the next 30 years, with such great works as \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"Islands in the Stream\\". These later works highlight his strong development, his maturity and his calibre as one of the greatest writers of the 20th Centruy.     - by Gene Pisasale   Author of \\"Vineyard Days\\" and \\"Lafayette's Gold - The Lost Brandywine Treasure\\"
B0036EH40Q|5.0|I waited forever for Tombstone to come out in Blu Ray. Well worth the wait. One of my all time favorite westerns. The clarity is excellent. I'm your huckleberry.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|In retrospect the music I listened to during my teen to college years (mid 70's - mid 80's) was probably the worst period for popular music - REO Speedwagon, Boston, Kansas, Styx, Heart, Van Halen. That stuff was all polish and no soul. I was too much of a straight laced, dork to appreciate the organic, blues and folk based sounds of the Woodstock era bands that I listen to now like the Gratefu Dead, Hendrix, Allman Bros, Led Zepplin, Santana, etc.. . It wasn't until U2, The Clash, REM and the Talking Heads came around that music started to get interesting again.     Anyway...I am always keeping an ear and an open mind out for new music. I like a lot of the indie bands and decided to try the Black Keys and they are now one of my favorite bands. I love the blues based, distorted, bumpy, thumpy sound (sorry about the queer cliches) and for the most part coming from just 2 guys. I have all their CDs and I like them all equally.    I love the distorted, fuzzy vocals of Dan Aurbach and his solo CD is great as well. I am going to see them here in Boston at the end of July. I think if you like these guys you will also like Dead Weather (one of Jack White's groups).
B002ZG98LO|3.0|A tough group of humans find themselves on another planet run by the alien skull hunters we like to call Predators. The movie is way better than the AVP movies, but it's still nothing more than just a good popcorn flick. While Adrien Brody is surprisingly bad ass despite his Clint Eastwood like voice being kind of laughable.<br /><br />  But the movie could have been more since Robert Rodriguez wrote the script. You can tell he's a fan, you got the same musical score and a lot of the movie is a little similar to the first film. By watching the trailers where Rodriguez introduces the characters, you can also tell that he had fun creating them.<br /><br />  None of the characters are developed that great though. We learn about the characters when they talk about how tough they are and what they can do but with most of them we don't actually get to see what they can do. From those trailers, I think Rodriguez was most excited about Topher Grace's character being more than he seemed. So I expected some great secret about his character but it turns out to not be anything too special or unpredictable.<br /><br />  Laurence Fishburne was the most wasted though as a mysterious guy that has survived amongst the Predators by wearing their invisibility gear. That may sound cool, but he doesn't get enough screen time when I was the most interested in seeing his character get some action. While the ending didn't leave me with much, it might as well have just said \\"To Be Continued\\", but I don't think anyone will care if it does continue even though the movie wasn't bad.
B002VPE1OS|3.0|I've used several screen protectors over the last two years between all my husband & I's iPhones. I thought these came with the best instructions of them all. Very easy to use tabs and stickers directing you how to apply. I am not the greatest at doing things like this and often have to refer to my husband for help. I did apply this screen protector all by myself and for the most part absent of air bubbles. It does it's job, protecting your screen from being scratched or broken. I have used it for a few weeks without any damage to my screen while often dropping and improperly handling my phone, ha ha. So for inexpensive, easy to use protectors these are great. The clarity is great. My only complaint is that they seem to not be as sticky as others I've used in the past. If you have a case on it probably won't matter too much, but otherwise you might notice corners peeling up just a tiny bit. Although, it is the summer and it's hot and again, I don't use my phone very carefully. Hope that helps. I'll probably buy them again to save money, you get three for a fraction of the cost of the single ones at the Apple store.
0143038419|4.0|This book is generally an easy read from cover to cover, with a really slow part plopped in the middle.  Elizabeth Gilbert's journey is anything but a travel tome.  It is a self help book, wrapped inside a memoir, with a mystical packaging.  Her characters spring to life, all the better that they are real people.  I loved her self-effacing wit.  She's really hard on herself and her faults.  Essentially she's just an average gal looking for an extraordinary life.  And she's not above doing the hard work to get that tiny bit of wonderful. It's just a bit too much \\"ashram\\" and a little too little \\"experience\\".  I loved it.  I ate it up.  But initially I skipped about 40 pages in the middle (India) to help move it along.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Julia Roberts should do justice to the character.
0553382152|5.0|If we had to think that death was the end, for most of us, what would be the point?  Why do babies get sick and die?  Why are some people born crippled or in poverty, or rich?  It hardly seems fair.  Embraced by the light by Betty Eadie gives us God's point of view.  Earth is a testing ground where we can see if what we're truly made of.  We give ourselves weaknesses to make us grow stronger in the overcoming of those weaknesses.  We grow emotionally when we are struck by tragedies.  We become more empathetic when we go through hard times.<br /><br />Eadie's book is so clearly written and so down to Earth that it's easy to understand what could be difficult concepts.  Wouldn't you know it that we'd have to die to figure out what our lives on Earth are all about.  Thank goodness Eadie came back to let us know that there's nothing to fear.  That God loves us and that we're eternal.<br /><br />I love the chapter on choosing a body.  About the spirit trying to get two young people together so that they could be his parents.  Puts a whole new spin on blaming your parents for your own short-comings.  I guess we only have ourselves to blame for how our lives turn out if we're the one choosing our parents.<br /><br />In the end, Eadie claims that we are here to love each other.  Sounds like a great idea and maybe if everyone had a near death experience,  we'd all be more loving.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1608605809 When I Dream]]
B00005221L|3.0|The mushroom cloud at the end of this movie is appropriate, because the corn in Predator is atomic in its proportions. Whilst it is probably rightly described as a sci-fi classic, and is notable for some of Arnie's most natural acting, the film is let down by that still alive and well curse that plagued US military/action movies during the 80's: massive, unashamed cornball dialogue, 'bad-ass' green beret type characters, and scenes of gung-ho bravery and self-sacrifice (if you can call it that). Examples include Carl Weathers and Arnie greeting one another with an arm-wrestling, \\"yo bro!\\" type grip purely to compare and showcase their bulging biceps (\\"DILLON...!!! YOU SON OF A BITCH...!!!); Blain being the big man by chewing tobacco, making pathetic boot-camp style comments regarding his supposed sexual prowess, and carting around a mini-gun; \\"Billy\\" hanging back because some suggested, innate indian 'sixth sense' tells him \\"...there's something out there!\\" whilst he carves 'warpaint' wounds into his bare chest with a survival knife the size of a samurai sabre; and the stupid fugly predator itself activating a recorded 'last laugh' for Arnie that sounds like it came straight out of a Hammer film. But the most nauseating, gut-emptying scene comes when Bill Duke - \\"Mac\\" - is out in the boonies reminiscing about the 'good 'ol times' he had with Blain in \\"'Nam\\", complete with a token bugle montage in the background. Mate, if you and Blain had really been in Vietnam you would have got your arses shot off and handed to you on a platter within five minutes of hitting the LZ. Just like that worthless shitheel in Die Hard who comments to his co-pilot \\"Just like 'Nam!\\" whilst he bravely strafes the bad guys from a helicopter, this is an insult. The most amusing part of the movie was seeing these various turds get sequentially wiped out!

0525423842|5.0|This book is interesting from start to finish.  It truly shows what can go on in a childs mind, and that if they believe they can do/be something that will make a difference they can,  with allot of dedication.  This is a great book for young or older minds.  Grisham never fails to meet or exceed my expectations of a great book to read.
0545123283|5.0|I wish I had had the chance to reread SHIVER before this, but when I saw LINGER on the shelf early, I snatched it up. And, of course, had it read in two days. It was amazing. But what else can you expect from Maggie Stiefvater? Her writing is amazing. Whether or not you like the story, the writing is beautiful.<br /><br />When I finished SHIVER, I loved the ending, and I felt that there didn't need to be more. It felt very much like a stand-alone novel. But, man, am I glad it wasn't.<br /><br />I liked this one even better than SHIVER. However, with four POVs it was a little more difficult. I had to go back several times to see you was narrating. It states very clearly, but sometimes I forgot to look. Anyway, I liked Isabel even more. And I liked Grace better. Sam was swoon-worthy as before. He may be too perfect, but not too perfect for me. Perhaps this is why I'm single. I'm picky and haven't met my Sam. New character, Cole, was introduced. It took me til the end of the book to decide whether or not I liked him.<br /><br />And... this one made me cry. SHIVER got the tears filling my eyes, but LINGER had them rolling down my cheeks. Wonder what FOREVER will do. I seriously can't wait to read it.<br /><br />On a side note, something interesting about these books. SHIVER has a blue cover, and the ink inside is blue. LINGER has a green cover, and the ink inside is green. I don't know if FOREVER has been assigned a color. I hope it's purple, but I see it in my head being rose colored. Hmm...
B002VPE1XY|3.0|I can only give this case 3 stars because it is a poor design, compared to others I've used.    The Design Flaw  =================  1. The hole for the camera wrist-strap is in the middle of the 'flap' for the case.  2. If you take the time to thread the wrist-strap through the middle hole, carrying/swinging your camera around is completely fine.  3. Now let's say you spot a once-in-a-lifetime double rainbow, or unicorn, or the Lochness Monster, or a UFO in China - you reach down for your trusty AmazonBasics camera case, lift the magnetic clasp 'flap' and pull out your camera, but now the camera case is in between your wrist-strap and the camera and the case flops right in front of the shutter just moments before the Lochness Monster disappears - drats, missed shot opportunity.  3a.  Okay, lesson learned, so now you're just walking along and there's the most beautiful unicorn standing underneath a majestic double-rainbow, so this time you take your wrist out of the wrist-strap, you pull the camera out, but the wrist-strap adjuster is stuck in the middle hole of the camera case and you almost drop your camera (because you are no longer using the wrist-strap) and you manage to snap a pic after moving the wrist-strap, with the camera case still hanging on the wrist-strap, caught by the wrist-strap adjuster, but the extra time of fumbling around, the double-rainbow and unicorn disappear - drats!  Another missed shot!  3b. Okay, lesson learned - threading the wrist-strap through that middle hole is too inconvenient, so you put your camera in the case and have the wrist-strap come out the side.  The only issue is that now that entire case is not too balanced because instead of the wrist-strap coming out the middle hole and letting gravity do its thing, the wrist-strap is coming out the side of where the cover flaps over and as you carry it, the tension of the wrist-strap pushes on the side of your case and it dangles at an angle, versus straight down if you used the middle hole.  (This is hard to visualize unless you've used this case, so just trust me on that.)    Verdict  =========  There are better designed cases out there, like horizontal ones versus vertically like this one.  With the horizontal ones, there is no \\"middle-hole\\" to thread the wrist-strap, the wrist-strap just comes out the horizontal side.  Now you won't miss any last-minute shots of UFOs in China.  Here's just a sample pic of how a horizontal case is a better design: [...].   Even fully zippered ones allow a small opening for the wrist-strap so you don't have to thread it through a hole in the case each time.
0920236162|5.0|Our twin daughters had just turned 3 when we got them this book.  They are into the usual girly stuff but dragons and dinosaurs top the list, so we bought this book for the dragon.  They love this book and recite lines from it all the time, especially the \\"I'm a very busy dragon, come back tomorrow\\" line.  We own \\"Love You Forever\\" and looked at other Munsch books but none others interested us, \\"The Paper Bag Princess\\" is a true stand alone winner.  Hopefully when the girls are older it will teach them a little about about walking away from loser guys :)

It's easy to listen to it in background, but if you REALLY listen, you'll be amazed at how much these two know each other and play as one.  As one of Keith's [untrained musically] students told him in his car after listening to it, she said 'it's like you guys could just pick up each other's instruments and play them like you do with your own'.  You'll keep coming back for this one.

B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|This EP seems to have divided the fans even more than Perfect Symmetry did.  I'm throwing my hat in the \\"pro\\" corner.<br /><br />It's probably fair to warn fans of the earlier Keane sound to proceed with caution, but there's nothing here that can't be appreciated with an open mind.  If you already like Perfect Symmetry, then you're halfway there.  It's still the great songwriting Tim & co. are known for, just in a different skin.  The great melodies and the soaring choruses are still here.  I quite like this kind of sound anyways, and I think it's great to see it revisited in a modern context.<br /><br />Keane are shaking things up a little bit, and I like it.  You might, too.

Velcro belt loop works great. The case is well-constructed.<br /><br />Only weird thing is the hole at the top, presumably for the wrist strap.

B00061HJ4S|5.0|This is my favorite model - period. It has great detail and is at a reasonable price. Tamiya has been around for years and is really the benchmark to which other plastic models are compared. I made an 88mm Flak Gun when I was a teenager in the 70's and it was awesome. I am now getting back into modeling after being away many years and can't wait to do another one of these. However, it is a bit more challenging than some of the other armor Tamiya models, so I would not try this one until I built up my proficiency (it has many very small detailed parts), but it is definitely worth working up to as a goal. In other words, this should not be the first model you try to build. It works wonderfully as a stand alone piece in a diorama or can be combined in armor battle scenes or with aircraft as this gun was often used as a anti-aircraft gun as well.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|You know those dour German schoolmasters of a century ago who caned their pupils for the slightest offense? Well, those school kids grew up to be sadistic little boot-lickers in search of a scapegoat. We call them Nazis.  Summing up director Michael Haneke's Das weisse Band that way is simplistic, of course -- there have been plenty of repressive societies, and they didn't all end up worshipping swastikas -- but it suggests a possible explanation for an unsettling, mysterious, compelling film.  Our narrator is an elderly man, once the nerdy young schoolmaster (Christian Friedel) whose wooing of a fresh-faced girl provides scant happiness among the town's disciplinarians. For Haneke's village is filled with patriarchs who figure that women and children, if only they did as they were told, might turn out to be nearly as useful as oxen.  Haneke's languorous shots sketch the flow of rural life: This happens and that happens, and then this other inexplicable thing happens, and suddenly the implication hits and you realize just how sick and unhappy these people are. (Oscar-nominated cinematographer Christian Berger shot in color, then drained away all the hues to produce judgmental black and white.)   Haneke has coached subtle acting from his cast. With unsure gestures and darting eyes, for example, Leonie Benesch conveys shyness and desire as the teenage would-be wife. When confronted with an unexpected act of generosity, the lips on Burghart Klaussner's stone-faced pastor part as if to speak words of thanks, then return to their customary pout. And Haneke apparently searched through thousands of children to find the ones who could alternate between crying and creepy. (His subtitle, after all, is \\"A German Children's Story.\\")  The authority figures try to be reassuring. \\"The world won't collapse,\\" says the smug patriarch to the disappointed suitor. \\"The world won't collapse,\\" says the town's doctor (Rainer Bock) -- right after he delivers one of the ugliest, most humiliating rejections of another human being you'll ever overhear.   But they're wrong. Their world was collapsing all around them; they just couldn't see it. A world war was about to erupt, and there'd be another one after that.

0446618322|2.0|Nicholas Sparks has wonderful plot ideas; he's just not an amazing writer.  I feel that if he was able to capture the story in a different light I would enjoy reading the book more. I find it harder to finish Sparks's books right away because he doesn't capture my attention with his words. His plots alone are often not enough to keep me interested enough to read it consistently. I like Nicholas Sparks, don't get me wrong. I just think it would benefit him to maybe take a couple classes...
B001GCUER0|5.0|One of those series that it pays to watch the episodes in order. The, when you watch it the second time, you find all sorts of nuances you missed the first. The writing and acting is so wonderfully reminiscent of the sixties it makes you glad society has changed. I grew up in an advertising family in Ohio and remember the offices and clothes and the smoking and drinking when I accompanied my Dad to his accounts in downtown Cincinnati. Sometimes the characters and situations are tooooo real. Season 3 takes it up a notch. Can't wait for Season 4.
0743454537|5.0|This quickly turned into my favorite book. After seeing pieces from the movie in an ethics course, I decided to pick up the book and read it. Well, once I started it I couldn't put it down! The characters are so well developed and the story line is extremely detailed, Picoult didn't leave anything out. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|The movie on DVD that I received was in a beautiful case, but the movie was distorted on the Theatrical release side and the Extended side.  I used a DVD player, both computers in my home and I tried it in a friend's DVD player to make sure that there was nothing wrong with my equipment.  Please just refund my credit card.  This is the first time that I have had a complaint with Amazon.  I have received other DVDs and they were in perfect cndition.  Thanks,  Janice Mack Dickerson
0061765236|4.0|This book was tough to put down. Jodi Picoult is a master at creating story lines with a surprise ending and doesn't disappoint in The Pact. Although I didn't enjoy it as much as My Sister's Keeper, I still  highly recommend reading it!
B001FB55I0|3.0|I purchased this product thinking it would be some excellent version and not disappoint. Was great in terms of quality and sound, but the major gripe I had with this was that though it was shot in 16:9, the actual picture size was far less and compensated for the balance using black bars. To make it worse, the black bars were of a different contrast to the standard filler area that is seen on 16:10 displays. Well, it was a good watch with 3 discs and I like the movie, so I'll give it 3 stars instead of 2. Bittersweet purchase.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My little guy LOVES this pacifier.  He's just learning to suck and gets frustrated when his paci falls out and this helps him keep it in! Great product!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I purchased this due to the massive discount offerred on the product as well as it including a DVD and BluRay disc. I first wanted to check out how it was on DVD and played it back. As expected, the quality was great including sound on dts. As usual, the black horizontal bars due to the aspect ratio was present and wonderfully thick and annoying. Then I put in the BluRay disc. For a moment, I thought I had just opened up my eyes. You will not regret viewing the beauty of Pandora in HD as it was meant to be. Absolutely beautiful and stunning. Brilliant work in getting it that detailed. I guess the whole intention of including the DVD was to allow the viewer notice the difference as well and it sure did do its job perfectly. My only gripe is that there are detailed special features that I could notice in the menus, but then again it isn't something to worry about given the movie is gorgeous in BluRay. Missing the 3D version though, hence the 4 stars.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Great album.  I saw Devo live last week and they played a bunch of tracks off this album.  The studio recording is nice and flavorful, not sterilized like most modern production.  Sounds great.  The songs are fun, catchy, and zippy.  The girl on the cover is also very beautiful.  Highly recommended.
B00003CX8N|5.0|i saw this movie when it was first released more than 20 years ago. remembering that even then i thought it was a sublime yet poignant movie that in my teens left me appreciative of small movies with understated budgets and big acting!  saw it again recently. left me with the same feeling of warmth and bliss.  purchasing a copy if only because if i am still breathing 20 years from now, i know i can count on this movie to bring me back to that special place and time.
3832793836|5.0|Having been always interested in black and white photography, i had a good time reading Personal Best. There's more than meets the eye in reading the book- Erwitt really has a thing for freezing time and taking monumental photos that seem to have unique individual persona. Love the smell of the new book too.
B003LAH7MU|5.0|Sting reworks some of his greatest hits with the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra backing him. Some of these tracks I would consider classics. Some songs are not that well known, but I enjoy them anyway.  My favorite track would be \\"Englishman In New York\\". This song celebrates individuality.  I love the clarinet playing on this tune.  I think the violin and harp playing on Roxanne gives this song a romantic dignified tone. \\"Next To You\\" is a tune with a great beat.  All the musicians playing their instruments in unison gives this a energetic punch that I love. \\"When We Dance\\" is a beautiful somber love song. The piano playing on this song is simply lovely.  Sting plays the harmonica on the track \\"I Hung My Head\\".  He makes a song about feeling guilty sound beautiful.  \\"Eveything She Does Is Magic\\" is another gem on here. The musicians in the orchestra play flawlessly together on this song. \\"We Work The Black Seam Together\\" is a very moving song about displaced coal miners.  This is one of Sting's lesser known songs, but I think it is musically arranged well.  The subtle horn playing on this track is superb. \\"End Of The Game\\" is another lesser known song about foxes running for dear life.  I like the cellos playing on this song.  \\"She's Too Good For Me\\" is a groovy three minute party of a song. Unfortunately, Sting  does not sing all of my favorite Sting songs on this disc. I have to buy a concert ticket for his tour in the near future to hear the entire Sting/Police catalog.  I love the music on this disc.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|Guy Ritchie wanted to create a different, more action-oriented version of Sherlock Holmes and he succeeded. Having seen and enjoyed Ritchie's film \\"Snatch\\", I had an inkling of what to expect - an action movie with plenty of wit. Still, this movie has enough mystery and intelligence to be recognizable as Sherlock Holmes.    Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Holmes - charming, witty, and introspective in turns. Jude Law does well as Watson, who is trying to leave Holmes behind in favor of marriage and a more stable life, but seems unable to. He continues to help Holmes pursue Lord Blackwood, a cult member who dabbled in the dark arts, was caught by Holmes, and then executed only to apparently rise from the dead. Blackwood has been killing those around him in his quest to seize power. Complicating matters for Holmes is Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), Holmes's love interest and the one person who bested Holmes in the past.    The defining \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" moment comes when he is able to explain everything logically, including some events that appeared supernatural. At the same time, Holmes is also shown as a fighter, both in the ring and battling the villains. Personally, I like the portrayal of Holmes as an intelligent action hero of sorts. It might not be traditional, but it seems to work. The main characters were all nicely fleshed out so one cares about them.    The setting and visuals were great and consistent with traditional Sherlock Holmes. The dialogue was witty and well-written in general. Action sequences were used throughout the movie, but there was an equal share of drama as well. I think Guy Ritchie has done a great job of developing a more modern Sherlock Holmes without compromising the essence of Holmes.

B000BGH22W|4.0|I bought this CD for myself because I am planning a Yule Ball at my school and wanted to have a copy of Harry's Waltz. The soundtrack is great! Mine shipped quickly and was in great condition when I got it! Patrick Doyle is one of my favorite Potter composers and I think all the tracks are wonderful. The only other Harry Potter soundtrack I own is the first one, and I noticed that there are fewer tracks on Goblet of Fire's soundtrack and was surprised that all the tracks are shorter which is why I gave it only 4 stars. But overall, great soundtrack at a great price!

1400030293|4.0|Gordon is the story, told from her point of view, of a woman picked up one night in a London pub by a proverbial tall, dark stranger.  Louise has returned from service in Germany as a captain in the British Army following the end of World War Two.  She is all at sixes and nines and hopes to run into one of her `old gang' in the pub.  Instead, she meets Gordon, who singles her out from the crowd and whisks her away into the night.  Louise is surprised at her docility in going with him.  She is further surprised when, while they are walking in a park, Gordon literally sweeps her off her feet and forces himself on her.  She has neither consented nor objected and wonders if the man's acts qualify as rape.  He finishes with her quickly, before she can decide how to react, and tells her to meet him the next day.<br /><br /> Louise becomes enthralled by Gordon.  He dominates her ruthlessly, probing into the inner recesses of her mind to ferret out the dark secrets of her life.  She submits to him sexually while struggling to maintain some semblance of equality with him.  Her efforts are doomed.<br /><br /> Gordon is a psychiatrist, also recently returned from service in the army.  He is cold, calculating and is thrilled by his ability to torment Louise mentally, using the tools of his profession.  Louise reveals that she has fled her loveless marriage and is waiting for a divorce.  Gordon picks at the scabs of her wounded psyche revealing to her for the first time the nature of her compulsions and the life of self delusion she has led.<br /><br /> The novel was written in the sixties and its publication was banned as pornographic.  The scenes of sex are tame by today's standards, yet compelling as Louise becomes his sexual thrall.  Louise, while sexually experienced, would be considered sexually naïve today.  She is shocked when Gordon insists on using her while she is menstruating, having believed that dire health consequences would follow. She is humiliated when Gordon takes the time for a full examination of her vagina, never having seen it herself.<br /><br /> It is only years later that Louise finally comes to terms with their intense, brief relationship.  This realization helps her find what appears to be true happiness in a surprising way.<br /><br /> Gordon is a compelling read.  One might quibble with the ease and suddenness with which Louise falls under Gordon's domination, a weakness of the novel but a premise on which the entire work depends.  The atmosphere of post war London is well recreated and the methodical way Gordon assumes control over Louise is hypnotic.  I recommend the book highly.ll examination of her vagina, never having seen it herself.     It is only years later that Louise finally comes to terms with their intense, brief relationship.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Caress of Steel is my favorite album by Rush for a few reasons. Mainly its the raw energy and the flaws as some would call it. I prefer calling it \\"exploring\\".     Work has cursed me into the long commute this week, so I willingly gave Caress a listening six times today. Now I'm sitting here at the computer listening to Snakes and Arrows for only the second time. The first was a couple of days ago. I Haven't been into Rush albums since Hold Your Fire, I just kind of moved on and into jazz all the while soaking in 90's indi via Guided By Voices.     Snakes and Arrows. I'm so impressed with this album, and like Caress for a multitude of reasons but mostly for the same reasons. My number two album is Hemispheres, for its scope in theme. Snakes has this tonal theme going on. Spin Drift into the Main Monkey Business is obvious and stunningly cool. The whole album is darkly minor and dissonant with the right amount of major splattering. Just like my two favorites.     I suppose Alex's signature F# chord leads the way and sets my mood for Snakes and Arrows.    I'm happy to say I'm looking forward to the new Album \\"Clockwork Angels\\" as I once did so long ago with Signals up till Roll the Bones. I lost it with Bones though listening back now it holds up in a weird sort of way, even the rap sequence which has an unreal groove behind it.     Rush..... what a wonderful band.
0439023483|4.0|I thought this book was just OK...but by the time I got to the end, I couldn't wait to read the second book in the series. I just had to know what happened to the characters, and did I get a surprise!!! \\"Catching Fire\\" was excellent, extremely better than the first. Can't wait for the third!!!![[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]][[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]
0316010669|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in social psychological phenomena.  My personal favorite study was the one done by Paul Ekman where Ekman demonstrated the universality of people's facial expressions.  An excellent follow-up to this book is Social Intelligence by Daniel Goleman.  Goleman gets more into the mechanics of the snap decisions people make.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I am a huge comic book fan (read: dork) with literally thousands of X-Men Comics (everything from 1979 on basically), and I loved this movie. I liked all the X-Men movies, but this one was the best in my opinion. It was a far more personal story (obviously) and all of the actors were great. I especially liked Gambit in this movie. I thought he was portrayed wonderfully, and I really hope after the Deadpool movie, Gambit gets his own movie with the same actor, as he was AWESOME. This was the X-Men movie I have been waiting to see for 20 years, and I was not disappointed. I can only hope more of the X-Men movies are like this one!

B000002L9W|5.0|I remember the day when MTV actually played videos, and you could not wait to see the new World Premiere Video at the time. I also remember the day the DLR Yankee Rose video premiered on MTV. After watching it, I was completely floored, with my mouth wide open. I loved it. As a guitar player, I especially loved Steve Vai's guitar work on this album. From the opening Yankee Rose with the Wah Wah talk, to the more jazzy and laid back sounds of Ladies Night In Buffalo. Dave could have not put together a more great group of musicians to make this album, and also Sky Scraper, but thats another story.     I understand everyone has their own opinions, and thats great, they are so ever much entitled to them, like me and everyone else, but it amazes me when they try to compare this to a VH album, like Fair Warning, etc. People, its not a VH album, its a DLR album. He was out of VH at this time. Different band. Im amazed at the whining, bitching over this.
0307276902|5.0|I loved this book and James Frey's unique writing style.  As a child and sibling to a drug addict and alcoholic I found James recovery to be realistic and found myself with some understanding of the difficulty one may face to live a clean life and face emotions head on without covering them up with mind altering substances.<br /><br />Although it has come out that some of the book is fiction I found many parts believeable and rooting for James to make it in life and to tackle his addictions and overcome his old ways of pulling away from those he loves and not facing his emotions.<br /><br />I also found James Frey's writing style very refreshing!  His style tends to show intense feelings and  vulnerability.  The book was an easy read that I could not put down and was anxious to read the next book that follows \\"My Friend Lenord\\".  Highly recommended!!

B000005DQR|4.0|The best way to really rate and appreciate music is to listen to it years later.  The nostalgia and hype of the purchase experience has worn off and now you are just listening with clear ears, mind and heart.  I rediscoverd this CD in my collection in a recent multi-state move.  I went through boxes of old cds and loaded them into the moving truck for the 12 hour ride and came across my DJ Shadow cd.  At first I was like whoa I can't believe this has been hidden in the storage locker for years, what was I thinking.  Anyway the CD is back in the rotation and people keep asking about it.  4 stars for being good 14 years on.
0307454541|5.0|It truly is superb and in interesting ways, but be wary of the hype and the jacket blurbs.  It is not, for example, a piledriving page-turner.  The story builds very slowly and deliberately.  The relationship between the title character and the protagonist does not develop until we are more than half way through a very long book.  The plot is very textured and layered.  It is atmospheric, but not in the style of a James Lee Burke.  Instead of flora, fauna and deep local history we have place names, street names and some corporate names.  `Ikea noir' is one person's description, but there is little Ikea here and a great deal of noir.  The story is simple: a journalist convicted of libel is hired to investigate the disappearance (decades ago) of a rich industrialist's beloved niece.  The industrialist's lawyer hires an investigative firm to check out the journalist and is pleased with the work of one of their freelance operatives, a young, seemingly anorexic, tattooed and pierced computer hacker.  The hacker and the journalist join forces to plumb the heart of darkness in freezing Sweden.<br /><br />The claim that the book represents  the union of Ingmar Bergman and Thomas Harris is accurate.  The focus is on people, troubled sexual people, and while the depravity that is uncovered is violent and perverse the story is about the detectives, particularly the young woman, whose journey to the novel's conclusion involves several forms of personal redemption.<br /><br />The woman, Lisbeth Salander, is Larsson's most memorable creation.  Although the journalist, Blomkvist, has most of the time on stage, that stage comes to life whenever Salander enters.  She is the kind of character who is capable of becoming a cultural icon in the manner of Hannibal Lecter.  Deeply flawed and troubled, she has the rarest of gifts.  We simply cannot get enough of her.  Fortunately, there are two other books and part of a fourth awaiting us.<br /><br />Several of my female friends have lamented the book's violence, violence which is largely directed at women.  There is such violence, but it is briefly (though specifically) described.  It is not lingered over at length in a salacious way.  It is there, however; we are not in the world of Jane Austen.  On the other hand, we ARE in the world of Lisbeth Salander, who has little patience with those who would abuse her or other women.  Her responses to that abuse are of the sort that the airborne rangers describe as `on-the-spot corrections'.  She can wield a laptop computer but she can also wield a field-expedient weapon with the best of them.<br /><br />The plot reminded me a little of a Val McDermid novel (a novelist read by Blomkvist in the course of this story): layered, textured, slow to develop, but always ominous.  The centerpiece is a fascinating character, &agrave; la Thomas Harris, and the plot's surprises and mystification with regard to pace are slightly reminiscent of Jeffery Deaver.  In English translation at least, the writing is workmanlike, but not exceptionally rich or philosophic.  While not `unputdownable', I hated to see it end, particularly with the lingering series of delicious conclusions.<br /><br />Highly recommended.violence which is largely directed at women.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Toy Story is the first installment in the franchise which currently has three blockbuster films!        The storyline is about childrens toys that are real and they go on various adventures together! The core group of toys are Woody (Cowboy), Buzz Lightyear (Space Ranger), Ham (Pig), Rex (Dinosaur),and Slinky (Dog). There is also a lot of toys such as Little Bo Peep and Eche-a-scetch appear periodically throughout the movie.          In this film Woody gets left behind at a gas station and eventually gets captured by the mean kid across the street Sid and Buzz has to overcome the fact that he's a child's play toy to rescue Woody who is strapped to a rocket!         Overall a very good way to kick off the Toy Story franchise, with many more to come!
B001FB5634|2.0|In my best estimation, I have to assume the attempt with this movie was to spark deep thought with a bit of an artistic twist. All of the content that would achieve such a notion was no doubt left on the cutting room floor. I can appreciate that notion if it is achieved. It just wasn't.    If you dig a bit, you will see a struggle for a father to show love and give protection to his son no matter what the cost. Unfortunately, it was wrapped up in a huge package of BORING.    This in a post-apocalyptic movie which we have seen several come out recently, and you come to expect a cretin bit of adventure mixed with some action and perhaps a little thought provoking content as well. This movie was dark and had little beyond that, listening to a little boy wine and cry as they walked and walked from one boring situation to another. While we are at it, the son did wine and cry way, WAY too much. He was raised after the virtual destruction of the earth (we were never really told what happened which bugged me) and, being raised in such a time, he would have been tough and accustomed to the world being what it was, all he ever had known. Instead, he constantly wines and cries. Did I mention he wines and cries a lot?    I do indeed see some high marks from other viewers. So, perhaps my perspective is just that. I am, however, thankful for Redbox, because if I had spent more than a dollar, I would have been even more disappointed.    If you are looking for a good movie with the same premise, I would highly recommend The book of Eli. It had everything I would look for in a movie like this.
B0035J6TAI|3.0|I LOVE Peter Gabriel - pretty much my #1 favorite artist, but I was underwhelmed by this album.  It's interesting and unique, but I just had a hard time getting into it.  I hope a new album is upcoming that goes back a bit to his prior work.
0061922315|4.0|Both my mom and I just loved \\"Secret Daughter,\\" about three women: Somer, an American doctor who discovers she's infertile and adopts a baby girl from India; Kavita, a poverty-stricken Indian woman who gives away her baby girl to save her life; and Asha, the daughter, as she grows up. All three storylines are followed throughout the book, and they come full circle when Asha seeks out her birth family as an adult.<br /><br />There are some difficult parts to read; the very beginning has an extremely difficult chapter involving Kavita, the poor woman, when her first daughter is killed by the father. (Kavita is such a compelling and inspirational character, overall -- the part where she and her sister journey to the orphanage to give up baby Asha is wonderfully written.) I also had a tough time relating to Somer, who did not seem to be a particularly three-dimensional character and struck me as a rather detached mother and wife. But overall, I thought this book was a great read, particularly for mothers, daughters and anyone whose life has been touched by adoption.
B0002CERX2|2.0|This GOODTIMES version of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) is recorded in LP speed and doesn't contain a HiFi audio track.<br /><br />Slower speed non-HiFi tapes have degraded picture quality, with sound clarity that's dependent on the alignment of your machine's playback head (a stationary device similar to the sort found in a cassette deck). The slightest variation in azimuth from the mfr's dubbing unit means blurry audio, often with a background squeal. Additionally, such slow-moving tracks have limited frequency range and an increased amount of flutter.<br /><br />All HiFi videotapes come with a back-up linear track such as described above, but on HiFi VCRs the sound, which is laid down on a slant alongside the video portion, is picked up by the rotating video drum. This simulates a tape moving at an enormous rate of speed. The advantage is a frequency response, dynamic range and harmonic distortion level that nearly equals CDs in quality (if you connect your VCR's audio outs to a decent amplifier).<br /><br />All pedantry aside, for anyone still seeking a videotape of this classic film, choose one from a major studio rather than a budget brand like GOODTIMES.

B002SQ364Q|4.0|\\"Taking Woodstock\\" is one of those films I could have easily missed.  I had no desire to see it, and it was only by chance that I ended up catching it OnDemand.  I can only say, as far as movies go, that I am very pleased I happened across it.  The movie was a fantastic depiction of the behind the scenes story leading up to the monumental event which has become infamous.  This might be the only concert in history that literally, on its own, defines a specific decade and what life was about during the much maligned period in time.<br /><br />Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) is a young Jewish guy trying to do the right thing and help his parents save the family motel business.  He moves back home, forgoes his dreams of heading to California, and ends up being the President of the local Chamber of Commerce.  Think of any small town in America with a couple thousand people and you get the idea of the farming community they called home.  His crazy mother is so out of control she has actually began charging extra for towels and clean sheets to the few guests that venture their way.<br /><br />The roles of Elliot's parents were played by Imelda Staunton and Henry Goodman and I have to say I am not sure there has ever been better performances on the screen than these two did in this movie.  They were phenomenal in their parts, making you both love and feel sorry for them as they rode through life pinching pennies, and fighting to keep the bank from foreclosing on everything they owned.  Having grown up in a small town of 1,600 people myself, I almost felt like I was back home while watching the perfectly adapted settings Ang Lee so magically brought to life.<br /><br />In an attempt to bring business to the local community Elliot happens across a newspaper where the headlines focused on a concert permit being pulled for an event called Woodstock in a neighboring town.  Elliot has personally headed a local musical production each year in his own back yard, already has his approved permit, and gets the idea of coordinating the events together.  He calls the Woodstock executives and within a few days everyone is in full gear putting pegs into holes to make the event happen.  All it took was a phone call, a local farmer getting his pockets greased, and a bunch of people with wads of cash ready to listen to some music.<br /><br />Elliot really does meander through most of the story which makes for a slow rhythmic flow that putters in the 45 mile per hour speed zone.  Don't expect any high paced action.  Once you connect with the pace of the film you can focus on the underlying tone which deals with the \\"hippie\\" generation and what people were attempting to discover.  Themselves.  Elliot doesn't know who he is or what he has the potential to become.  He finds himself trying marijuana, acid, experimenting with homosexuality and the free spirit of sex in general, not to mention some really awesome music.<br /><br />In the end \\"Woodstock\\" forever changed the way a nation would view \\"hippies\\" and as we saw within the movie it also drastically changed the way a family looked at itself.  Elliot was shot down the path of finding himself and in the process discovered secrets about his mother and family that rocked the foundation he thought his life was built upon.  The movie really does an excellent job at providing the backdrop of a serene hippie generation, comfortable walking around naked, doing drugs all while being polite to everyone around them.  Once you get past that the growth of Elliot surrounded by the insanity of his family adds for a very compelling story.<br /><br />Excellent movie, not perfect, but definitely worth viewing on a quiet evening if you have the need to relax and let things slow dowidea of coordinating the events together.  He calls the Woodstock executives and within a few days everyone is in full gear putting pegs into holes to make the event happen.  All it took was a phone call, a local farmer getting his pockets greased, and a bunch of people with wads of cash ready to listen to some music.    Elliot really does meander through most of the story which makes for a slow rhythmic flow that putters in the 45 mile per hour speed zone.  Don't expect any high paced action.  Once you connect with the pace of the film you can focus on the underlying tone which deals with the \\"hippie\\" generation and what people were attempting to discover.  Themselves.  Elliot doesn't know who he is or what he has the potential to become.  He finds himself trying marijuana, acid, experimenting with homosexuality and the free spirit of sex in general, not to mention some really awesome music.    In the end \\"Woodstock\\" forever changed the way a nation would view \\"hippies\\" and as we saw within the movie it also drastically changed the way a family looked at itself.  Elliot was shot down the path of finding himself and in the process discovered secrets about his mother and family that rocked the foundation he thought his life was built upon.  The movie really does an excellent job at providing the backdrop of a serene hippie generation, comfortable walking around naked, doing drugs all while being polite to everyone around them.

0688156819|5.0|This book was brand new. The pages were still stiff from not being opened.  Almost unrecognizable scratches on the back paper label from being pulled on/off the shelf. Nothing different that I would have found at the book store. Near mint condition.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|First let me say that I have not read any of the books, and I had no prior knowledge of the series before seeing the movie.  I think the second disclosure I should make, for the record, is to seeing this movie on the plane.  Granted I was lucky enough to see it in first class, but still, the screen is tiny and the sound just doesn't bode well for a good movie experience.  I am sure these factors degraded my appreciation, but I have to admit there just wasn't much there to pull me in.  It seemed cumbersome, choppy, forced.  Almost as if it were tripping over itself as the movie progressed.<br /><br />The movie begins with Percy living the life of an ordinary high school student.  He has no idea he is a demigod and the son of Poseidon.  During a trip to the museum he gets attacked by a creature from beyond and finds out the world as he knows it is not quite as it was.  His mother along with his protector (Brandon T. Jackson) attempt to take him to the safety of the school for the God's offspring.  Mom then quickly gets abducted and shipped off to the God Hades.  Seems that before Percy even has a chance to digest his newfound status he immediately sets off on a quest.<br /><br />His goal is to grab a few keys for the return trip home, but these are guarded by a few ugly looking creatures.  Medusa is played by Uma Thurman and all I can say is in context of the movie, oh how the mighty have fallen.  Uma attempted to reincarnate her \\"Kill Bill\\" persona, with a hair full of snakes, but sadly there was just something missing.  That seemed to ring true with most of the story.  Luckily Uma only graced the screen for a few minutes which led us to the overriding plot.  Poor Percy was accused of stealing Zeus' lightning, and at some point he really needed to clear his name to avoid an all out war of the Gods.<br /><br />In the end of course Percy saves the day and hands over the lightning, back to Zeus the rightful owner.  He rescues his mom and luckily she finally evicts the foul smelling step father.  Apparently he was only around to mask Percy's aura anyway.  Damn, now what a mom will put up with for the sake of her god like son.  We never did get to see if Percy hooked up with Alexandra Daddario, but she was one of the truly refreshing aspects of the movie.  She played a hard core fighter with just enough of the soft side to keep all the young boys on their toes.<br /><br />Keeping in mind this was a movie geared toward the younger generation, it was ok.  It seemed like it could have been so much better but just never quite figured out whether it was an adventure film or a comedic spoof.  The lame jokes were buttered a little too heavily for me to tolerate in an all out epic quest flick.  I would be have been a little saddened to have paid money to watch this film, but on the flip side it would have most likely been substantially better if I had seen the movie on a screen larger than six inches while sipping Champagne.<br /><br />If you are a 12 year old boy or younger you will most likely enjoy the film, if you are anything older than 12 you will probably walk away wondering why you watched it.  Still, if you are flying coast to coast, and you have nothing else to do, flip on the headphones and lay back.  It will make the time go by faster than watching the clouds below..

B00275EGX8|5.0|I generally do not like war movies, but this one is different.  It puts you right in the streets of Baghdad.  It's very well done, and is suspenseful and interesting from start to finish.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I recently finished the full 4 season run of The Tudors.  Basically it retells the major events during the reign of Henry VIII in a manner that makes it dramatic and exciting.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers, for any personal faults he may have, plays an excellent king.  He really brought a personality to the role that impressed me.  The supporting cast is also excellent; I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of Anne Boleyn.    You will see varying comments about the historical accuracy of the show.  For a non-historian like myself, it was quite good.  When a character would die (to avoid spoilers!) my wife and I would look them up on Wikipedia.  The series sticks pretty closely to the large strokes of what really happened.  Yes, they do play around with timelines and even make major changes like combining Henry's 2 sisters into one ... but for the most part it is pretty close.  If that sounds egregious to you, then I'd recommend just sticking to real histories.  It actually got us interested in reading about the historical events.    The creative license they take makes for an entertaining ride.  For events that put me to sleep in school, this show manages to maintain a good level of suspense and anticipation.  Of course, it probably helped that I didn't remember anything from my classes!  The costumes were particularly excellent.  Henry has a different opulent outfit in nearly every major scene.      In all it was quite an enjoyable ride and I highly recommend the series unless you are a historical purist.
B000SEI618|5.0|What a phenomenal book.  Banville creates such personal stories that plumb the depths of his characters' psyches and hearts.  The Sea deftly explores a man's return to the beach town of his childhood, weaving in episodes of his early years as well as the recent events that brought him back to the town.    I highly recommend this novel, for anyone interested in deep characters and nuanced story-telling.  It is highly engrossing and meaningful.  Banville's best so far in my opinion.
B002FGU45I|4.0|I just purchased a second pair of Teva sandals for my Husband.  He was decidedly a non-sandal guy, but Teva changed his mind.  The customization possible with Teva won him over.  These fit his wide feet like a glove.  Thank you for the quick shipping and excellent service!
B00005QDW1|4.0|The lithe machine-woman that is Gwen Stefani is a strange concoction: if you take away the massed slobber-factor 9 which the poor woman inevitably invokes every time she exhales, it then becomes interesting to sift through what's left.<br />She's not a big singer; she can carry a tune in a limited bucket but she's nowhere close to Bush, Bassey or even Banshee.<br />She can write a choice lyric occasionally, and luckily knows when a chord-change or counter-melody is effective, and that's basically her. Shouts of 'star quality' and 'charisma' don't qualify without the lush strawberry image - and she wouldn't receive either if she looked like Peter Andre.<br /><br />'Rocksteady' achieves pleasantness despite reservations. Purely on song terms, it wins by a leg: the sub-Trojan ballad 'Underneath It All' curls up at your feet after swirling fetchingly around your senses, and the Christmassy 'Running' allows GS unexpected vulnerability far beyond the rattling collection tins of similar angst-maidens, playing on the gullible wallets of lustily sympathetic daddy-figures.<br /><br />All-in-all, 'Rocksteady' is a success, while ultimately operating light-years away from any sort of great-album status. Gwen is good, but she should stick with what she knows - and that means knocking her largely abysmal solo career on the head for a start.<br /><br />Stefani without the ogling and the drooling isn't much fun to be honest; you wouldn't rush to something even as superb as 'Early Winter' without at the very least the promise of those excellent legs completely dominating the video, or those proficiently pouting lips redefining glossy feminine redness in her 'live' MTV appearances.<br />It's quite ridiculous to attach any kind of artistic seriousness or aesthetic longevity to her; in any context, she can't be considered anything other than ornately transient.<br /><br />'Rocksteady' is fun and frolics, while you search for the true loves of your life.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I'm wishing that I had rented this before buying it on demand.  I had expected more from Brendan Fraser... ok, maybe not, its hit or miss with him. The movie is filled with predictable and poor writing, combined with non-stop cliche.  It is as if the horrible writers who know only non-stop cliche decided to make a new movie titled 'Journey to the Center of the Earth'.  I really wish I could get a refund.       I wouldn't even recommend it to rent.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is an excellent documentary showing the infiltration of large corporations into the farming communities all across America, the effects of such which include inhumane treatment of animals, the exploitation of illegal immigrants to work the meat-packing industry, the power big corporations have over farmers, and how big business and the government run the whole show together.  It is truly sickening to watch some of this stuff, but it is the reality of our capitalistic society.  Integrity has been thrown to the wayside in favor of the almighty dollar.  A must-see for everyone!
B000H7JD4A|5.0|This could be one of their strongest albums....Powerslave has always been my pick, until this one came along....This album has all that and more....  Brutal, dark, skillfull, moody, beautifuly composed, etc....iron maiden is back.....i could list the good songs, but honestly, they are all incredible....this is an album that needs to be listened to in its entirety.....  this is a must buy for all real IRON MAIDEN fans.....    btw, go see them on their FINAL FRONTIER tour....it ruled!!  UP THE IRONS!!!
1603580557|5.0|This is the BEST book on Systems Thinking I have read so far. My hats off to Donella Meadows for making the principles and truths about the functioning of systems so easily accessible to us by looking at common day-to-day systems that we see or participate in, in light of these principles. The book is such an easy read! We recognize the principles and realize that we have intuitively known and seen them in action all along and even learnt most of them formally only to forget them eventually. Yet, there is a freshness in relearning them with Donella as our guide. We actually learn when and how to apply these principles and understand systems that we participate in or are of interest to us very deeply. The simplicity in which they are presented by Donella speaks volumes of her deep understanding, knowledge, greatness and humility.     I have read other books on the same subject where I had to throw down the books in disgust as one author wrote copious paragraphs on why he should be recognized as the father of systems thinking and rest of the book was pretty much unreadable, and another author tried very hard to be clever and make the topic very intriguing and thought provoking but was nowhere close to it except in his own mind.    Thanks Dana! I am going to read this book several times over. It is life changing. And, I truly mean it.
B002VPE1OS|4.0|GUEST REVIEWER - !MRS. KNOW IT ALL ;>b<br /><br />Easy to install, nice feel, and protects the iPhone nicely.  I only need to see how long this will last with usage.  Most other screen protectors get foggy over time and don't prevent the iPhone from getting scratched---so time will only tell for this one.  But right now, I would recommend this product.
1401359418|5.0|This book is fantastic. It's not only an interesting read but brings to light a lot of great points to what 'luck' really is.
B003QO4BNO|5.0|I actually got this for free for joining a reviewing website.  I just LOVE the music in this episode!  It's definitely worth a watch and listen :o)
B002UXRGM0|5.0|If you liked the Planet Earth series, you'll like this as well.  In my opinion it is equal if not better.  The picture quality is reference material.  The \\"On Location\\" feature is a nice addition over the Planet Earth series.  This feature takes you on location with the filmmakers and you get to see how they were able to get the amazing footage they were able to capture.  Highly recommend.
0446569895|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Having been an Ozzy fan since my early teens, I have followed him through his life. He has led an amazing life. His sense of humor is what really keeps one hooked on this book. It is hilarious. I was laughing out loud every time I picked it up.  I'm amazed that he can remember all the details of things that happened in his life. Very enjoyable read even if you aren't an Ozzy fan.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Looks incredible on Blu-ray, and it's great that it comes with a regular DVD to lend out to friends so I still have a copy to watch for myself.
B000002LOE|5.0|REM is awsome, sure beats the hell out of David Matthews band by far, you won't regret buying this CD, it's great to listen to while your drivin, studying, working or anything your doin.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It had a good storyline and plot. However, I was a bit disappointed with the ending. It was vague and a total cliffhanger and I expected more. Fortunately, there is a sequel to the Maze Runner that will tell us what happens. Overall, I recommend this book, especially for teenage boys and older.
B002U33GUQ|1.0|I am a big fan of Brad but I must say that this CD came to me as a big shock. Track after track it was painfull to listen to it. The music is completely different to what Brad normally plays and I do not like this new direction he is taking ( I hope it is a once off ).    Honestly, the music is dull and his playing is boring. Very disappointed with this CD and is a waste of money.    I am not sure why some of the reviewers gave it 4 or 5 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i loved this book! it had such a unique storyline and i CANNOT wait to read catching fire. katniss, peeta, the hunger games, all of it was clever and well thought out. i could not put the book down...it was sooooo intriguing. its one of my fav books... its numba one!
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|I could repeat what many have said, but I will keep it simple - this is a fantastic soundtrack. It has a very unique sound and fits Guy Richie's style very well. After seeing the movie I couldn't get the main melody out of my head for hours. When I bought the soundtrack, I must have listened to it two or three times and savored every track. Discombobulate is a thoroughly enjoyable 2 and half minutes of fun.      Good stuff. Hans Zimmer is in the same exalted category of great composers as Goldsmith, Williams, Horner, and (more recent inductee) Giacchino.
B0000524CY|5.0|I bought this item few years ago! (sorry for late review) but the movie was in best shape it could be in..played perfect and shipped very fast! If i ever see you selling a product that seems interesting will buy from you no questions asked..Recommend to anyone to buy something from you
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is one of the few movies that is better than the book.  Superb is the only way to describe it.  My husband even liked it and he is not a big fan of English literature. Richard Armitage will take your breath away. If you haven't seen it...what are you waiting for?
B00011CZRE|5.0|I bought this movie few years ago! (sorry for late review) this movie came very faast..didnt care for the movie, didnt care for the plot but thats not your fault! my fault for buying a boring movie haha i was suprised it wasnt that great of a movie because morgan freeman is in it and hes one of the best actors ever! movie shipped fast and came in perfect condition
B000850IHW|5.0|Free Hand is another example of Gentle Giant providing more entertainment than a barrel full of monkeys.   Well \\"His Last Voyage\\" doesn't entertain me as much as it probably does others.  Poo on that.    Let's talk about that song first, shall we?  Yes we shall so without further ado, let's get started!  Hey, when you mention a song in the intro line it's kind of rude to dart around and mention other songs.  You wouldn't talk to a girl at a party and then, after a brief moment, suddenly walk away and talk to another girl instead, would you?  WOULD you?    Anyway, yes, \\"His Last Voyage\\".  It's gently touching and forest-like enough that Peter, Paul and Mary should have been extremely proud of it back in the day.  Of course they were too busy performing \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\" to pay attention to British prog rock, but well... yeah.  Not that I can actually see Peter, Paul and Mary ever listening to Gentle Giant... well maybe if they were high as a kite and locked inside a log cabin, lol.  Anyway, it's a cool song.  The lead singer sings the first half with such sincerity.  Don't underestimate his singing skills.  It really resonates with me on a personal note too.      What's especially weird about this song is that, despite its beautiful and quiet nature, you can sometimes pick out those clever and distinct tricks taking place in between the verse melody.  It's really strange.  You know what kind of tricks I'm talking about too- tricks that only Gentle Giant would implement!  It's like a Stephen King book!  Beauty and eerieness combined.  Gentle Giant is one of a kind, that's for sure.    \\"Just the Same\\" makes you wanna jump out of your chair while waiting at the doctors office and completely embarrass yourself by snapping your fingers to the BRILLIANT beat of the vocal melody.  Everyone else waiting then puts down their book for a moment to glance in your direction and think you must be some kind of fruitcake, but you can't stop snapping those itchy fingers and singing \\"I'm just doing what I want to do, nothing more and nothing less than you!\\"  It's such a wonderful and peculiar feeling.  You gotta dig it.      When the song shifts into the instrumental portion... well by this point everyone at the doctors office already thinks you're weird (and probably even comes to their own personal conclusion why you're there in the first place) so you mine as well pretend you're playing the guitar like a real rock star.  Shake your head up and down and really get into it.  You'd have to shake it awkwardly to all THESE bizarre time signatures, that's for sure.    Ah, what's next?  \\"On Reflection?\\"  Yes, reflect.  Reflect on the fact that what initially sounds like a severly unorganized vocal section in the beginning actually shifts into one of the most beautiful vocal melodies I have EVER heard.  I'm not being sarcastic either.  That is an *extremely* passionate vocal melody, and I believe those are flutes and strings playing along to the vocals which enable me to like it even *more*.  \\"I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years that we've shared in our way\\".      GOD is that a good melody.  It's to die for.  No no, it's too beautiful to think about death.  It makes me think about picnics for some reason (with no pesky basket-carrying ants to ruin my perfect moment of bliss!)    After that God-like vocal section takes a sudden unfortunate exit, the song shifts into what can best be described as super neato weirdo vocals.  Actually I think the band is attempting to take the vocals from the beginning of the song and repeat them in a really strange way with a grand finale of musical chops added to even greater (and weirder) effect.  Those Gentle Giants and their whacky antics!  That's why we love them dearly, hehe.    Oh, and I could have sworn that \\"All around, all around, all around\\" part came from a Who album, specifically Tommy.  Someone listen to Tommy real quick and tell me what my mind is thinking about.  Oh,and one more thing (yes that's right, I'm STILL not done talking about \\"On Reflection\\"- it's THAT darn good!).  When I said those vocals in the beginning are extremely messy, I meant the very first time you hear them- after a while you will grow to absolutely *love* them.  You see, it's the complex style of the band totally screwing with your innocent little head.  It's supposed to make you feel weird!    The title song I have to mention now because sometimes a little negativity never hurt anyone.  I don't like the vocal melody.  I think it stinks!  It marches along in an obnoxious way, like a soldier marching into a drug joint with bad intentions.  It's weird how the singer pauses for a moment and screams \\"In the games you... PLAY!\\"  I actually like when he does that, but everything else the singer does here needs to take a hike back to the Rocky Mountains.    Now with THAT negative little burst of uncontrollable anger out of my system (which isn't really angry at all when you think about it, but compared to my more normally subdued nature, it is) let's talk about other portions of the title song.      Listen to the instrumental break about 4 minutes in.  Tell me that doesn't remind you of a pretty ballerina princess doing her cute little thing on stage.  \\"Mommy loves you, sweetie!\\"  Or maybe it reminds you of somewhere cold like an ice skating rink in New York City (yeah you know which one I'm referring to- just how many movies have USED that particular rink?).  Either way, you're sure to feel beauty, because it *is* pure beauty.  That part of the song alone saves the entire darn 6 minutes!  Well, that and the chicken-plucking chops that follow it.    \\"Mobile\\" is awesome!  It reminds me of cowboys and rodeo events.  Those bulls won't catch up to me because the tricky rhythm section in which the vocal melody is sung makes me completely unstoppable!  Yeah!  Feel the power!  If a bull manages to catch up to me, let's hope someone jumps out in front of the wild beastto stop him dead in his tracks (like it's done in real life).  And by \\"real life\\" I mean TV, hehe.    Pick up this Gentle Giant album right now for more of their crazy tricks displayed in all its melodic and clever glory.  \\"All around, all around, all around, all around...\\" sorry I got dizzy there, hehe.
1906735875|5.0|I have read bits of Judge Dredd over the years, mostly by way of crossovers like Batman / Dredd or recent one-shots, but I never took the time to go back and read the stories from the beginning. When I saw this omnibus come out, I decided the only way to judge the Judge was to read the series proper and it was a good call.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar, Judge Dredd is the central character in a long running comic series out of the U.K. that is set in the far future where most of the planet is a wasteland and the few remaining cities are overpopulated fortresses called MegaCities. Within these cities the rule of law is contained within the Judges, computerized cycle-riding individuals who carry out sentencing and execution on the spot. The most recognized Judge is Joe Dredd, a harsh dispenser of law and order.<br /><br />These books are an interesting mix, as they really are sustained by breakneck pace more than character development. In many ways, they are the polar opposite of a series like The Walking Dead, which is all about the people and less about their world. With Dredd, the world is really the story. This is hard far future sci-fi, with cities that are completely computerized and rampant with robots, a colonized Moon and Judges that can fire heat-seeking bullets from their guns. Most stories are short, especially in the earlier runs where the criminals were found and stopped within 6 or 7 pages. That's not a criticism, though, the artwork and future-shock feel of the Mega City makes these stories great short burst reading. Later in the volume the stories begin to get bigger, with cliffhangers and longer lengths. The artwork throughout is also solid, especially Brian Bolland who is a fantastic illustrator.<br /><br />As for Dredd himself, it's easy to see why he's so popular. While he's not the deepest of protagonists you'll ever read about, he has a code and he sticks to it. I think Dredd the character is like comfort food, no matter what's blowing up around him you know he's coming through in the end.<br /><br />If you like action mixed with sci-fi that's not too worried about being realistic, Dredd will appeal. If you're going in looking for deep insight into the character and some exploration of why he's the way he is, look elsewhere. This is simpler stuff, but that's not to say it's not great reading.nd him you know he's coming through in the end.<br /><br />If you like action mixed with sci-fi that's not too worried about being realistic, Dredd will appeal.

B00000I07P|4.0|this is a good cd of classic rock.i would definely reccomend this to a friend.
0786838655|4.0|Stephen Taylor took the words right out of my mouth, but here goes my review anyway :]<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Fast pacing and characters are pretty developed.<br />- Does a nice job of catching you up throughout the book with mini recaps of what the characters have done so far.<br />- VERY smooth/easy reading. I went through the first two books in this series like lightning. You hardly realize it until you're almost 2/3's of the way through the book!<br />- The Greek mythology is still pretty cool even though I've got more of a background in it than perhaps the younger audience that this series is intended for. It's a nice way for kids and adults alike to learn about mythology and have some fun at the same time :)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- As others have mentioned, the Harry Potter resemblance is there. It gets better in Book 2, but it is a little cheesy and you'll find yourself rolling your eyes a little bit. This is probably my biggest quip about Book 1.<br />- Percy's narration is indeed a little over the top sometimes and can sometimes sound forced when trying to be casual/humorous. This is a minor quip though, I understand this series isn't meant to be exclusively enjoyed by the college to older adult crowd but for a younger crowd<br />- still, someone else also pointed out that J.K. Rowling didn't quite have as many cheesy moments and the dialogue was just different. Her series wasn't necessarily meant for the older crowd either, but her prose and narrating style still made you feel like you were just gliding through an awesome series<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Definitely worth reading. The Harry Potter relationship with book involving kids and magic is inevitable at times. J.K. Rowling set the bar high with the Harry Potter Series and anything that remotely resembles her series in terms of kids books will always be a notch below it. That doesn't mean that Rick Riordan hasn't created something special with this series. It's just hard for me to give it beyond 4 stars so far until I see less of a Harry Potter theme/similarity. For the prices these are going for, pick it up! It's a great way to feel like you've just blown through a book. :) 3.5 stars.<br /><br />-Travis Sive it beyond 4 stars so far until I see less of a Harry Potter theme/similarity.

030726999X|4.0|This is the best one of the trilogy. Salander is on trial for her freedom and the SIS is out to get her. How can she win her freedom with the secret police as her foe? It is a nail biting thriller with a few quirky \\"Really?\\" moments, but they don't hurt the story at all. Just hang on for a great ride.
B000002KY8|5.0|this about the 3rd time i have purchased this album. i used to listen to it all the time in 1982 and 1983.when i hear this cd it brings bsck good memories. if you have not heard it i would recommend it.
067144901X|5.0|I didn't know what all the hype was over these books until we read them. My daughter who is 10 months LOVES this book...she loves the part when the \\"three singing pigs say LA LA LA\\" she loves to say LALALA....then at the end when you read it's quiet now what do you say\\"- She goes LALALALALA so funny! This has become our new favorite book- I highly recommend this!
B003JSU2NU|5.0|Although this sound track is darker than the others, it certainly fits with the theme of this movie and I love it!  Alex Patsavas has done a phenomenal job once again! I have spoken to others who have seen the movies and never even noticed the music ----- this I don't understand! I am very aware of the soundtracks to movies I love and have discovered some great music from these soundtracks. I have also purchased the Scores for the movies!

B003L20ICE|2.0|Except for some scenes and Anette Benning's acting ( which was flawless BTW) found the movie ridiculous, most parts unbelievable and almost homophobic. It completely reinforced the dogma of \\"being gay is a choice and these women need to be with a REAL MAN to straighten them out\\".    The movie would have been good if it remained focussed on the turmoil caused by reentering of the sperm donor in this family's life but the whole lesbian sleeping with the guy thing was stupid.    I can understand a lesbian woman ( who is shown to be decidedly Lesbian in her 40s at least - NOT bisexual) getting drunk and maybe have sex with a guy ONCE but conciously and repeatedly having sex with him AND seeming to enjoy it ... NO I dont buy that.    In one scene she actually is shown to look at the guy's penis and her expression is of pure joy and ecstasy as if she has discovered the true meaning of nirvana. I m sorry but that is not what a Lesbian make.    There are some very good scenes involving the kids and the relationship changes they experience with the entry of this new person in their lives. However the movie was ruined for me by the whole lesbian women enjoying sleeping with the straight guy angle.     Also, I could not understand how these beautiful women ( the other straight African american woman the guy is sleeping with is GORGEOUS and much younger) are throwing themselves at this scruffy looking middle aged guy who looks like he has not shaved and/or had a shower since he donated sperm 20 years ago!    As i said earlier it was clearly one of that \\"THIS is what these poor women are missing\\" moment. Icing on the cake is... these women get off on watching Gay male porn. I dont know of any lesbians who like watching gay male porn while having sex themselves. I sure also dont know of any gay men who get turned on by lesbian porn.    I can understand Lesbian women wathcing gay porn as entertainment and getting some laughs, even admire the male body for what its worth, but I dont buy the notion that they get turned \\"on\\" by watching gay male porn while having sex themselves unless they are bisexual! I may be wrong but I dont think gay men would get off in a bathhouse while watching girl on girl action.
0679411585|5.0|As a Viet Nam vet, this was a very emotional read for me.  It very accurately discribed the way things happen in a battle.  It also gives a brief view of how politicians, sitting in their safe snug offices, play their games without a thought for the lives of men and their families that are being forever changed.     I liked the way it followed up on the survivers.  You very seldom learn what happened with the friends you made.  Did they make it back or are the still trying to cope with the physical and/or mental wounds they brought back with them.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews about this, but I don't know why.  This is a phenomenal piece of work that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.  It's a wild adventure, far wilder than the cartoon and it's far more than just a re-telling.  It ties together the land of fantasy and real life and wraps it up with a powerful, positive, uplifting message.  One of my favorite lines in this film is \\"You look like Alice, but you've lost your much-ness.\\"  That is a profound thought!  How many of us have grown older and lost our \\"much-ness\\".  I've watched this several times now and my view has stayed the same.  I totally love this film.  It is totally Tim Burton, but it is also totally Lewis Carol.  Disney is an after-thought.
B003FK8V7G|5.0|I'm really impressed with this effort from Gaslight Anthem. It's hard to discover good rock music nowadays but it feels good to know that I've found GA, and hopefully they'll be making quality music like this for a long time. I've listened to this CD more than 5 times and it just keeps getting better.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|I must be getting more emotional as I slowly close-in on forty. It used to be that I never cried at movies or books. I still remember the first book I cried at the end of (Magic's Price by Mercedes Lackey, the book series that also helped me come out), and that was when I was 19. I was twenty-five before I cried at my first movie (Titanic). It wasn't until three years later when I saw A.I. - Artificial Intelligence that I did it again. So I'm not overly sentimental, as you may have gathered from this and most of my blog.    But lately I've been crying like a baby at a bunch of different movies. Everything from The Red Balloon, to Up, to Where the Wild Things Are, getting me to cry at a movie is getting easier and easier. Maybe they're just shamelessly manipulative, or maybe I'm starting menopause.    To that list of films that had me all weepy we can now add Toy Story 3. I'm not a long-term fan of the Toy Story franchise. I only saw the first and second one a few weeks ago when Amazon had blu-ray versions on sale for $30 if you bought both. I saw them and liked them, so I was looking forward to this newest version.    Our film opens with Andy, the boy who owns the toys, getting ready to head to college. He's seventeen and hasn't played with his toys in years. These days Woody, Buzz and the rest spend most of their time sitting around in the toy box inventing new ways to get Andy to come open it and peer inside. This does not make for a happy set of toys.    Eventually the day comes when Andy is packing up to go. He plans to take Woody with him to school and put the other toys in the attic, but due to some confusion on his mother's part all the toys end up out on the curb ready to get picked up by the garbage men. Woody, seeing this, rushes down to help and through a series of unfortunate incidents the toys then end up at a daycare center.    Life there seems to be ideal, especially for Barbie once she meets Ken, but Woody's main concern is getting back home to Andy.He tries to rally the other toys, but no one wants to come along. Eventually he leaves as the toys that remain learn that paradise isn't what it seems to be.    There's plenty of action and peril in this movie, a bit more so than in the others. In addition to a menacing purple teddy-bear and his creepy baby-doll henchman, there's also many sharp blades, a grinder, flames, and, perhaps most dangerous of all, toddlers. The resolutions to the various bits of peril were entertaining and satisfying, including one resolution that I'll describe as machina ex machina.    The film isn't perfect (I could really do without Randy Newman's music. Ever), but I really enjoyed it, and the final scene is fitting, moving and deeply wonderful. This is one of the few movies I've seen this year that I actively look forward to seeing again, and while that's not saying much given that this summer has included films like Grown Ups, it is nevertheless a great recommendation.
B002ZG9788|3.0|Sam Worthington has definitely become an overnight sensation, with Terminator Salvation(not so great, and Avatar(great to most) he has really made a name for himself as a great action guy. Well his acting ability has been foreshadowed by mostly super CGI effects and cardboard dialogue, with the exception of Avatar where he actually did some good acting. In Clash Of The Titans he does a great job, actually to good for the rest of the film which lacks and substance or solid storyline at all. Sure Zeus, Poiseddon, Hates and all the boys are there but they really do nothing more but talk back and forth, and don't really give any great presentations through the film other than Hate's and Zeus making an occasional appearance on earth here and there. Most of the script feels like it was written by a few college kids in drama class, and is spoken as that. The one amazing thing of course that everyone and there brother went to see this movie was for the special effects. Yes they are spectacular but does that make a great film, well no, not really. The giant scorpions, medusa, and the cracken all are very incredible characters and the movie has no lack of action what so ever. However your just left with the idea that you witnessed a little over 90 minutes of I-Candy, a bit like some sort of mythological porn, so to speak. So its not bad, and its not great, if your looking for a CGI show for your giant LCD/LED tv this movie is great for just that, but just a rental, thats about all. Unless you have friends who come over at different times and you want to show the movie off, its noth worth much more. But kudos to Sam Worthington for making what could have been just one big turd into a pile of small ones, he definitely stole the show as far as actors go. Hopefully he'll be in something more dramatic to really show his true potential. Crooked cop films perhaps? We'll see. Later.    Btw, you can watch the trailer and see the movie!! With some awesome music to boot!
0307454541|2.0|Suddenly left devoid of public respect, the Mikael Blomkvist is left with nothing but jail time and a questionable job prospect for the rich industrialist Henrik Vanger.  What starts as a whodunit novel, where Mikael's job is to discover what happened to Harriet Vanger in 1966 long presumed deceased under the guise of writing Vanger's biography, becomes a rapid descention into the unknown.  When a breakthrough in the research surrounding Harriet's disappearance occurs, Mikael brings in a virtual acquaintance, the 25 year-old ward of the state Lisbeth Salander whose methods are as unorthodox as her appearance.<br /><br />It is certainly an interesting tale.  However, it is needlessly spun over 600 pages.  While I sympathize with the author himself, the unfortunately deceased Stieg Larsson, someone should have stepped in and edited this book.  It firstly took nearly 200 pages for the plot to be revealled and the reader enticed to continue on with the story.  No book worth its weight in deceased tree pulp should take 200 pages to set up the plot.<br /><br />The remainder of my complaints lies with character development.  The first character to be unrealistic in what we are supposed to believe is a sadly realistic story is Mikael Blomkvist himself.  In his interactions with Lisbeth Salander, we are led to believe that through her eyes, he is a caring yet not pushy individual who wants to understand her and be a good friend to her without demanding anything in return.  That is flawed on two points.  For friendships and other relationships to occur, we must give something of ourselves in exchange for something of the other person.  This often comes in the form of trust and honesty.  The second point is that we do not actually know his intentions.  He does not push her in any way nor does he do so with anyone else.  Is he really just that sensitive to the needs of others or does he not really care?<br /><br />Martin Vanger (along with his merry Vanger clan) presents more character flaws.  Is every one in this family so naive or proud or whatever the morally corrupt call it, that no one could simply leave an anonymous tip about one of their sadistic, abusive, rapist own?  And can such massive flaws be entirely hidden from the outside world?  Not only does the family not report any misgivings but neither do possible witnesses who see young women whisked away by the handsome, rich stranger.  Is it possible to have such a life so succinctly hidden from the outside world?<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander represents the final major flawed character in my opinion.  The girl with the dragon tattoo herself.  Either by nature or nurture she is relatively devoid of compassion but remains a vigilante for truth and justice, going to great lengths to expose the hidden underbelly of society.  She presents a character unconcerned with the day-to-day lives of those around her and is incapable of connecting to others with a positive emotion such as love.  In fact, she has no friends and is content with that.  Then, despite her characterization, she falls in love and instead of confronting that affection, she literally tosses it into the garbage.  End of book.<br /><br />That was where the book ended.  It ended both abruptly and without enticing the reader to become committed to not only the book itself but its characters as well.  There is thusly no pull to continue reading the series as the plot nor future characters are introduced to sway the reader to continue on.every one in this family so naive or proud or whatever the morally corrupt call it, that no one could simply leave an anonymous tip about one of their sadistic, abusive, rapist own?

B003ELMR9E|5.0|This movie is great, as one of Al Pacinos last great memorable films, other than the recruit which was enh, ok, this was a landmark film. As detective dormer he and his partner as many know go to Alaska where for the most part its very dark(during the six months of spring/summer) to go on a dark journey through lies and deception, and basically what is good and what is evil? Robin Williams does a stellar job as usual being the nasty perhaps psycho on the island, named Brody, a local book writer. When he is accused of killing a young admirer of his book, a young teen age girl, this start to spin out of control. Also as Al Pacino's partner gets gunned down there is also a very dark secret behind it as well. So most people have probably seen this film i can't really spoil it, but i will desist anyway. Its not really worth getting on Blu-Ray, i've had the original for many years and it suits me fine. There are no explosions, no car chases, no CGI, just a good psychological thriller from beginning to end that will keep you on the edge of your seat. So just get the DVD, or rent it, the blu ray doesnt nothing for it.

B000YABYLA|2.0|The people who like Juno outnumber those who don't 3 to 1. I'm in the minority. At times it's cute and amusing, and the acting is good. It's a quirky story filled with quirky characters, but even with all the quirks it is neither complex nor endearing.<br /><br />Juno is a preternaturally intelligent, precocious, attractive 16-year-old teen who makes up her own rules. Apparently no one can control or even influence her, not her tough, gruff father, not her tough, gruff step-mother, not her school, not her best friend or her boyfriend. But before too long we discover that Juno cares too much, that her rude, tough, pushy, arrogant, disdainful, manipulative exterior is masking a real softie inside. How original is that?<br /><br />To mix things up a bit, in a transparent effort to make up something \\"original\\" about the story, Juno decides one day to have sex with her boyfriend. Keep in mind that the most endearing quality about the boyfriend is that he is a totally passive pushover and is easily manipulated by Juno. It is Juno's idea to have sex, and when Juno says she wants sex, the boyfriend, Bleeker, has little say in the matter. Appropriately enough, the seminal act, as it were, is concluded not by smoking cigarettes, but by eating Tic Tacs (one of the many quirks of the film). Of course it was unprotected sex, because as I said, Juno makes up her own rules.<br /><br />Juno gets pregnant and she decides to give the baby to a set of parents of her own personal choosing. Juno's father helps her with the interviews, apparently accustomed to letting his daughter have her way. Juno quickly finds the perfect couple, and she can't wait to dump the unwanted baby on them, almost as if she has found a family to take a pet dog she's had for a month and now has grown bored with. Throughout the pregnancy, Juno continues to be the rude, rule-breaking person she's always been, though here and there we see glimpses of her softer side. She mostly ignores her boyfriend, who never really was a boyfriend anyway.<br /><br />The rest of the story is quite boring, the end is quite silly. But the movie is too earnest to be a comedy, though I have no idea what it is being earnest about. I don't think it's necessary to say more, except that, in the end, after the baby has been given away, Juno inexplicably decides that she, at 16, is suddenly in love with Bleeker, and no one is more surprised than Bleeker himself. It seems that even though Juno prefers to make up her own rules and break everyone else's, there is, after all, one rule that she would like to believe in: the rule of happily ever after. And if that doesn't make sense after what I've described before, it's not supposed to. :-)<br /><br />For those of you looking for a good, earnest, quirky movie about first love, I would suggest The Sterile Cuckoo with Liza Minnelli. It's an old movie (1969) and may be hard to find. The novel by John Nichols is good, too.anyway.     The rest of the story is quite boring, the end is quite silly.

0143038583|1.0|Pollan isn't making a good faith effort to understand or explain the impacts of modern \\"industrial farming\\", rather he is presenting a biased one sided history of man's quest for food and arraigning facts so that the reader will naturally drawn to his favored conclusion: industrial farming is evil and we need to revert to a preindustrial way of growing and distributing food.<br /><br />100 years ago, food was less abundant, more expensive and less safe than it is today, but through the careful presentation of \\"facts\\" and \\"expert opinions\\" (speaking of which, what is Pollan's expertise exactly? Oh that's right, he's an academic and a journalist!), he manages to present a picture of modern and preindustrial food that bears no resemblance to reality.<br /><br />Take foodborne illness for example. Pollan goes to great lengths to convince the reader that modern agriculture techniques are responsible for an \\"epidemic\\" of foodborne diseases and illnesses, but how big of an epidemic are foodborne illnesses and how does this compare to Pollan's much beloved preindustrial yesteryear? In 2000 the CDC estimated that foodborne diseases caused 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year. Sounds bad, to be sure, almost epidemic, but how does it compare with ye olden time food safety? In 1900 the death rate from foodborne illnesses was 142.7 people per 100,000. Scaled up, that would be the equivalent of 428,000 dying of foodborne illnesses today (that would be a REAL epidemic), not to mention the numbers who got sick. The advent of regional and national grocers and large scale mechanized food processors were responsible for these dramatic improvements in overall food safety through the implementation of standardized handling, processing and storage techniques.<br /><br />Industrial agriculture has seen a 100 fold decrease in the rate of death from foodborne illnesses in the past century, and Pollan wants to go back to ye olden times?<br /><br />Then there is Pollan's rather bizarre off topic rant about Fritz Haber. Pollan began by stating that he had never heard of Fritz Haber or the Haber-Bosch process, which is the chemical process used to manufacture synthetic nitrogen compounds. I know, shocking that an \\"expert\\" like Pollan would be so ignorant, but I guess they don't make experts like they used to. He goes to great length not describing the Haber-Bosch process but rather he takes the reader on an unrelated tirade on Haber's research and development of modern chemical weapons and his work for the Third Reich. What this has to do with \\"agriculture\\" is unclear, unless it's used as a not so subtle club to beat into the readers head the concept that industrial agriculture = war = Nazis. No wonder why Pollan didn't delve more deeply into Carl Bosch's (whose role he referred to as merely \\"commercializing\\" the process) life and his opposition to the Third Reich .... just didn't fit the narrative.<br /><br />Then there is the tricky part about how exactly we feed the worlds population without all this cheap food. Pollan very explicitly accepts that nations like China would have faced mass starvation had they not adopted things like synthetic fertilizers and herbicides/pesticides in the 1970's but there is this mile wide disconnect between the kind of solutions to this non problem that Pollen has discovered and the consequences of his preferred applied solutions to these non problems: the reintroduction of mass famine to the world.<br /><br />People like Pollan never seriously address this issue. They are always quiet when the ramifications of reverting to preindustrial agriculture are brought up. Perhaps since they live in the United States with its enormous agricultural potential they feel that they might be spared worldwide famine, perhaps they just don't care because they feel their affluence will insulate them from it.Pollan's rather bizarre off topic rant about Fritz Haber.

It gives you the story of this small child bred and raised to battle a race of aliens seemingly bent on mankinds destruction. He is awed by the other students at thde school he is sent to and yet is completely isolated from them mentally. I also enjoyed this book because I saw myself when I was little except for the awed part and how well he does. But I saw myself as a young child, alone and isolated from the other children.

0307454541|5.0|Amazing as well as disturbing look at the evil in people, the damage done to the innocent from this evil, and the response of the innocent to combat this evil.  I could not put the book down.  The plot was complex and engaging, and you could not help but root for Mikael & Lisbeth.  The portrait of sexual abuse and rape is graphic -- in my opinion a necessary element in the book's portrait of evil and the proper development of the characters.
0316098337|5.0|I don't want to give away too much about this book, as one of its chief pleasures is figuring out what's going on.  Even if you suspect early, based on reviews or on the blurbs or on whatever, at least make sure to watch as Emma the Magician slowly makes the situation clear.<br /><br />We are looking through the eyes of a strange little boy who lives in an unusual situation.  Emma Donoghue, who has written historical novels, Lesbian-life-in-the-first-person tales, revisioned fairytales and fables, and one of the best experience-of-mourning novels I know of, has here taken on something entirely other.<br /><br />And she pulls it off.  You will skirt the horror with Jack and his mother - nothing explicit here as the psychological suspense is plenty good enough.  You will observe maternal love in action.  You will watch a small boy adjusting to leaving the only life he has known and taking up what is supposed to be a better one,and turns out to be.<br /><br />This book is both a new departure for the author, and an excellent piece of writing with real impact.<br /><br />Avoid only if you don't like books that aren't straightforwardly plotted and have no devices in them.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I just treated myself to watching the movie on pay Cable and I'll admit it took several previews before I took the plundge to actually pay $3.99 for it.    I was fascinated by the multi-legged horses,and wild animals. How cool to fly a dragon and am fascinated by Pandora's evolution of the other creatures but I have to admit, any large creature with more than four legs and more than two eyes is creepy. If one does a search on Pandora you can get a great feel of what the planet is in terms of flora and fauna, the atomosphere composition, even why the mountains float. Some sort of magnetic thing with that rock everyone was so greedy for. What a fascinating bit of Na'vi evolution to have those tendrils at the ends of their braided queus that makes the bond with their four-winged, four-eyed dragon Ikran and their six-legged, four-eyed Direhorses. Some laugh at that. But those wiggly tendrils are an extention of the Na'vi nervous system which is no more unnatural than an earthling psychic who can draw impressions out of the air.      The Na'vi language too is fascinating developed by a linguist whose as fluent in it as many onliners who take the constructed language very seriously. One day I hope to master it. I've only mastered four words to date.       I don't know what this tree hugging crap I hear a lot people harping about. Understanding nature and trying to preserve it thus preserving your own survival isn't tree hugging environmentalist nonsense. One thing out of balance the rest falls apart.    The main characterizations are brilliant. We have Segourney Weaver who finally comes off as someone whose not an iceberg. She evolves enough to respect Jake Sully rather than considering him an idiot. She appreciates the gifts Pandora has, though ignorant in thinking the Military really cares about her research. She's believable as a scientist.     We have her assistant whose nerdy enough to be a scientist though looks a little odder as an Avatar.    We have that ignorantlittle dweeb who thinks he's in charge of everything who ignorantly thinks of the Na'vi as \\"blue monkeys\\", has contempt for Pandora's nature and can't grasp the fact that the planet is a neural network.    We have the Military General whose not overpoweringly evil but looks the part. I naturally didn't like him before he said a word.    We have Jake Sully who first follows orders but changed and for the better. He found a purpose. I loved his \\"Jarhead clan\\" line. I think he was cuter as an Avatar.    Then we have the Na'vi who aren't uncivilized barbarians but know and love the land because they're literally connected by their braided queus that makes \\"the bond\\" with animals and the Tree of Voices and even see tree seeds as \\"pure spirits\\". The Na'vi are a gentle people until you mess with them.    Yes, the story of Avatar is an old recycled one. But in this movie the  Na'vi are not only the good guys but unlike the classic cowboy and Indian theme, you get equal time with the natives. They're developed. You learn some of their ways. You hear their beautiful language. Maybe loving the land instead of exploiting it to ruin is considered tree hugging political nonsense by some, but  if you're a Na'vi lover which I am, you can't help but respect these peoples' love of the land. They fight to preserve what they have and although they suffered greatly, they refused to give in. They're the 'Indians' who finally won instead of always being portrayed as the consummate losers which is a twist on the old theme.    Granted Avatar is the kind of film that either grows on you or not. But to me, this movie has some imagination for once. It's deeper than Star Wars, it's not the constant blood and guts  of Alien whose body count is the theme, it's not a let's hunt you down for sport like Predator. Avatar is thought provoking, the special effects are brilliant that add not destract.    It's a two thumbs up flick for me and from an evolutionary standpoint I'm glad I only have one thumbon both hands.

0399156577|5.0|The story begins as a young couple, Devin and Rosie, on vacation in the San Juan Islands off the State of Washington have finished making love and, in the wife's mind, maybe making a second baby.  Their little boy Hugh is 3 years old.  It is cool and raining outside. As the wife gets going for the day she goes to check on Hugh as he is usually awake and bugging them by now.  He is not in the house and Rosie see that the kitchen door is open!  Hugh has a pet stuffed rabbit he calls \\"Wubby\\" and has shown a fascination with the animals they can see out the back of the cabin.  After the parents quickly search and call the police, the police call in Fiona Bristow and her Canine Search & Rescue Team consisting of 5 pairs of handlers and dogs.  The detail Ms. Roberts gives us is terrific although some readers have found it too detailed.  I felt the detail of how they search/rescue really made the story more interesting and I am not even a dog lover or pet owner myself.<br /><br />Hugh is found and returned only scratched and bruised to his very joyful parents.  When Fiona gets home with the dog, Peck, she took with her, she is greeted by her two other dogs and just when she is going to hop in a much needed shower, a truck pulls up and when he introduces himself as Simon Doyle, Fiona recognizes a new 'local' artist in woodworking and furniture making who recently arrived on the island.  He is gruff, blunt and to the point and definitely not a people person.  However, Fiona finds it interesting that he does like his new puppy his mom gave him and wants to learn how to take better care of it and train it.<br /><br />I found the growing attraction and interactions of Fiona and Simon to be very real.  They both have \\"baggage\\" that they are trying to overcome and shying away from serious relationships is their first instinct.  The copycat serial killer makes for some excitement and I was fascinated how Ms. Roberts took us a bit inside the criminal mind!<br /><br />Terrific read!
B002VPE1PW|4.0|There are several things to like about this case: it seems well-made and durable; it zips around three of the four sides so that it will open flat, and with two pulls zips in either direction; it has elastic straps at the four corners inside to help hold a netbook in place; the bright orange inside, which a matter of taste, adds some fun to a utilitarian product.    However, there were two reason I wasn't thrilled. First, it seems fairly big for my 9\\" netbook. Although it's supposed to fit 7\\"-10\\" computers, logic does dictate one case couldn't really fit snugly on a range of sizes. If yours is on the smaller end of that range it will be a loose fit, which I imagine is less protective. Secondly, compared to the sleeve we have for our other netbook, which I believe is the [[ASIN:B001F7HI02 Case Logic PLS-9 Ultraportable Netbook Sleeve for 7-Inch to 10-Inch Netbooks (Black)]], Amazon's has a lot less cushion. (Incidentally, Case Logic's only zips on two sides, lacks the elastic straps, and would have the same size issues, so there are trade-offs.) So this is not quite the perfect netbook sleeve, but may serve you very well depending on what you need.
0312330871|4.0|I have long loved Agatha Christie's work and I've read \\"And Then There Were None\\" several times (I teach the novel in a high school). My only issue with this particular edition is that, in an attempt to be politically correct, the publishers chose to change the name of the island from Indian Island to Soldier Island. This would be alright except that they left in all of the anti-semitic rhetoric (with regards to Isaac Morris) and racist comments about African natives. If you're going to go PC, then do it completely or not at all. Or better yet, educate people about the changes in attitudes from one time period to another and read it in that context.
1441866868|4.0|THE WIND UP GIRL AUDIO BOOK is a wonderfully performed book of a very bleak and depressing future much like Phillip K. Dick's work in DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP and the film version BLADE RUNNER. The world is in a post petroleum age and in an age where world starvation is an ever present fear. Somehow Thailand remains the undefeated country of the world and continues to get by with a people who love their under age queen.<br /><br />The down side of the book for me was it breaks down into soft core pornography at points to build sympathy for the title character, and in my opinion, she was sympathetic enough and it was just uncomfortable and superfluous.<br /><br />It is also a story of the corruption of power, and in its own way about love and redemption, although that might be a stretch.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book for the amazing vocal performance of the reader more than anything else, it is also a pretty good story but as I said, I could have done withought several passages.
B002AEB8P0|5.0|\\"Fairytale\\" is a sweet, beautiful album but not something to be listened to when you are depressed! \\"I don't want to be abandoned\\" is beautiful but gut wretching and \\"13 Horses\\", about 13 horses drowning one by one in a shipwreck creates the confusion and feeling of abandonment illustrated so realistically that I don't know of anyone and I mean ANYONE who can listen without crying!    In short,this is not an album for everyone and is an aquired taste!

0470477237|5.0|Still wondering whether social media is or not your cup of tea? Are we undergoing a major socioeconomic shift or is it just the heat of the moment? Erik Qualman, a respected social media guru, discusses these paradigms, shifts, along with many others in the pages of his fascinating book \\"Socialnomics: How Social Media has changed the way we live and do business\\" released from Wiley Publishing in August 2009. Just as the author mentions, \\"Socialnomics\\" does not need to be read from start to finish like a sultry novel, nor should it be. Rather, it provides useful insight into changes in macro trends, behaviors, and constructs as a result of social media. Just like social media itself, the book is written in sporadically digestible sound bites.<br /><br />To begin with, I warmly recommend Qualman's book not only for business people, but also for students, professors, teenagers, parents, because all of us have a personal or professional stake when it comes to social media. Social media is an extension of our real life, it is here to stay, so let's try to figure it out and adapt.<br />What do I love about \\"Socialnomics\\"? Well, for one, the research-based look at the impact of social media, fresh statistics and the multitude of case studies from across the globe &proof points that provide a good general indication of the value of social media. Of course, social media stats change with lightening speed from month to month, so updates and augmentations to this book can be found at [...]<br /><br />\\"Socialnomics\\" is structured into eight interesting chapters. At the end of each chapter there is a summary page which highlights the key points in that chapter. While reading the book, I often found myself nodding at author's points, smiling when recognizing real-life parallels. You might think that all these case studies and content rich pages will finally bore you. On the contrary! I adored the funny, sometimes ironic tone of the author. Particular quotes and examples will make you laugh for sure. Some of the readers have complaint about unverifiable claims or missing numbers to support the author's statements. We all have the right to express an opinion, don't we? As I see it, some \\"specialists\\" don't make the difference between an opinion, a fact, a theory and a hypothesis. Despite what other think, Erik Qualman is qualified to express an expert opinion. Qualman helped grow the online marketing and eBusiness functions of EF Education - the world's largest private educator, Cadillac & Pontiac, AT&T, Yahoo, EarthLink, Travelzoo and I find it fantastic that successful leaders find the time to share their thoughts and experience with people who look up to them as models.<br /><br />Even if some of the reviewers consider the case studies miniscule or superficial anecdotes, I can assure you that they are not! For instance, the \\"Dell Hell\\" case is a great, classical example of a company that faced the social media firestorm. On one hand, Qualman presents many interesting, strong case studies (Google, Stride - Cadbury, TripAdvisor, Coca-Cola, presidential elections etc) from various business fields, on the other hand unsophisticated examples have their own important role: there aren't only scholars and professional business people reading this book, so simple examples or anecdotes are a great way of talking the same language of simple, not very Internet/Business savvy people.  You will enjoy reading this book, even if you are a social media newbie.<br /><br />Why is there social media? Why has it gotten so big? Do we really need social media? Which are the advantages, disadvantages? Read \\"Socialnomics\\" and you will find the right answers. You don't have to blindly trust the author, simply draw your own conclusions. Erik Qualman makes a great job on presenting both the good and bad apples of social media, of course, by emphasizing the positive nature of this fascinating phenomenon. I find this approach more constructive, because it points out how social media can really improve our live and business, as long as we don't abuse or misinterpret this complex, global phenomenon. Social media is not a waste of time and we should learn how to use and embrace it before it squashes us.<br /><br />All in all, more than any other book, \\"Socialnomics\\" expresses clearly the vision that social media is becoming the key to successful business models. It presents an insightful analysis of the impact of social media on various industries and organizations and how it changed forever the way we live and do business. Qualman's book will help you understand this emerging behavior and the massive socioeconomic shift, it will greatly reward the reader. Let yourself be inspired by the wonderful world of Socialnomics!ur live and business, as long as we don't abuse or misinterpret this complex, global phenomenon.

B00275EHJG|5.0|What makes this movie great is it's heart and it's plot!<br /><br />Andy, the boy from the other two Toy Stories is going to college. He bundles his fav toys for the attic, for his memories or for children (when he has them). They get sent by mistake to Sunnyside daycare center. Instead of loving care they are given to the youngest, most out of control preschoolers with violence and anger management issues. Woody and Buzz Lightyear, et al, are used to hammer in pegs, for the kids to bite, spill food on.<br /><br /> At night, when adults and brats are away, the daycare center is run like a prison by sadistic toy Lotso, the Strawberry Bear with the help of a vaccuous fashion plate Ken (Ken and Barbie). Them the plot turns into the 1950's Classic Cool Hand Luke, with The Bear playing the part of The Captain (made famous by Strother Martin) and Woody playing Cool Hand Luke (the Paul Newman part) and Ken as a \\"Boss\\". Strawberry Bear doesn't say \\"What we have here is failure to communicate\\" but he does everything but, he has the same cane and the same accent, same attitude. He puts Mr. Potatohead in \\"the box\\" for punishment, (those aren't cigars in the sand!) Buzz Lightyear gets rebooted to \\"Boss\\" and romantic Latin Lover modes. Kids won't get any of these insider jokes, it will all fly over their heads, but I defy an adult to watch this movie without being near tears in places. I won't give away anymore plot, but just say its quite bittersweet to all who remember their childhood toys and earlier days and going to college. The ending is not as dark as Cool Hand Luke - it IS a kids movie!<br /><br />For those readers unfamiliar with Cool Hand, I recommend you see this movie and then rent the classic at the video store. An AFI Top 100 Movies of All Time.<br /><br />This could be the best Toy Story of the series, it certainly has the most detailed and emotional plot.<br /><br />The Next Big Thing seems to be 3D and there are more 3D movies than you can shake a stick at. Mostly trash. Hollywood should learn that it's not special effects or 3D that will bring people to the movies, it's movies with good plots, acting or in the case of Toy Story 3 good characterization. This movie has heart. Take the kids but it's really a must see for the parents who remember...it's not special effects or 3D that will bring people to the movies, it's movies with good plots, acting or in the case of Toy Story 3 good characterization.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|I purchased my first Devo album in the late 70s.  I own them all (including rare stuff), but their studio stuff went to hell after New Traditionalists.  This new album rocks.  Both the content and production are comparable in quality to their best material.  It probably sounds most like Freedom of Choice, but make no mistake--it's no throwback album. This is 100% pure Devo--still ahead of their time.  I was shocked that a band this old could come out with an album that (after a 2 decade absence) sounds as vital and hardcore as any of their back catalog.  If you were ever a Devo fan, buy this album.
B001FB563E|5.0|Agree with and can't really add to what other reviewers have said here. This is serious stuff. It does follow the book very closely and most scenes are exactly as I had envisioned them. It is a very dark, lonely, depressing story, BUT -- with a strong underlying element of hope and love. Specifically, that which makes us human, why we press onward when all seems lost. For what? In this case, a fathers love for his son. The mood expressed is not an especially popular one for a major motion picture and as such, is one of the reasons I bought it on Blu-ray, not because it is something I want to watch repeatedly, but because I have a LOT of respect for and want to support filmmakers that are willing to go against the trend of only producing light, pop-culture, feel-good, easily digestible \\"product\\".

B0037QGS0A|4.0|Atom Egoyan ('The Sweet Hereafter', 'Ararat', 'Where the Truth Lies') has a gift for setting up cinematic surveillance of private encounters and studying the results of an incident on everyone witnessing it.  In CHLOE he has engaged the services of Erin Cressida Wilson to adapt the French film NATHALIE by Anne Fontaine  to place it on this side of the pond.  In the French version the successful actors were Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and G&eacute;rard Depardieu: for this version Egoyan has an equally superb cast to carry off this mysterious story with great success. The same question arises in both films: 'what is imagined and what is real?', and it is the getting there that makes this film so fascinating.<br /><br />Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) is a gynecologist married to the successful professor of music David (Liam Neeson) and they have a stay-at-home hippie son Michael (Max Thieriot) who goes about his life much the same as his parents: there is superficial companionship but little in depth relationship. The marriage seems satisfactory until Catherine plans a surprise birthday party for David, a party David doesn't attend, and Catherine suspects David of having affairs, a fact that David apparently suggests by his flirtations with waitresses and 'help'. Catherine is shocked, but realizes that as she is aging this may be a normal situation in older marriages.<br /><br />Catherine visits a bar, a private club for assignations, and there she meets Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) and eventually buys Chloe's services as a prostitute to meet her husband and then tell her all about the encounters. It is agreed that Chloe will be paid for her services and only go as far as Catherine instructs. From this point on Catherine and Chloe meet after Chloe has encounters with David and describes the acts of the encounters in vivid and lurid detail. Catherine is fascinated and continues to pay Chloe for on going encounters and subsequent voyeuristic descriptions. Catherine even has a one-night stand of her own with Chloe in an attempt to understand her husband's need for infidelity.<br /><br />Despite the setup of 'private investigator and prostitute detective' the two women become friends. When Catherine realizes she has enough evidence against David to leave him there is a final encounter of the three (Catherine, David, Chloe, and even son Michael) that brings the ingenious surprise ending - an ending too fine to share as it would spoil the film for viewers new to the story.  Each of the actors does a star turn - Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried, and Liam Neeson - and once again Atom Egoyan takes an implausible story and makes us think.

B001MW0J2O|3.0|Good release from a competent band but this sounds more like an amalgam of things we've heard before. What's so aggravating about this album is you can hear some great ideas bouncing around but they're never fully realized. About 7 tracks in and I can't continue my listen- I have to take a break- too much indie silliness abound...     So we have a group of very talented people who sound like they've been told to make the same song 11 different ways. This is fine especially since the song is so good but I think the fans are the real problem- it's just not as good or innovative like they would have you believe (these fans should get together with Tool fans).  Yea, it's great they only used samplers- uh... I can think of about A MILLION other bands doing the same thing and have been for decades, that's not innovative... heck, hip hop is practically BUILT on sampling & sound construction.    A great cd for a few listens but nothing groundbreaking.
030726999X|4.0|\\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is the 3rd book in the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson. This hard covered edition in 563 pages in length. This book is a direct continuation of the story in Book II in the series.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />Fugitive Lisbeth Salander has been caught but is severely hurt and is awaiting trial for murder once she recovers from her life threatening injuries. Mikael Blomkvist and others do their best to prove her innocence while at the same time digging up disturbing facts about Sweden's State Security operations.<br /><br />*END SPOILER*<br /><br />This book, by far, was the best of the series. Was it perfect...no, it had its faults, BUT the degree of improbable and implausible situations/actions in this book was substantially less than in the previous two. Also, the books that preceded this third book had areas that tended to ramble on, letting the adventure get lost in minuscule detail of things that did little to do with the main story, but added significantly to the overall length of the book(s). This book seemed to remain more focused on the task at hand; the subplots were told succinctly and contributed not only to the overall main plot but were also interesting on their own and were dealt with in a timely and organized fashion.<br /><br />The only 'cheesy' areas in this book dealt with Blomvkist's exceptional attractiveness to the opposite sex and their apparent eagerness to drag him into their beds. To me, this diversion seemed to lessen the quality from this otherwise intriguing murder/espionage investigation.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I really liked this book; I found it hard to put down. Some areas in the other two books were boring and unnecessarily dragged out: not so with this effort. Author Larsson seemed to be able to keep a better focus on his main characters and their stories in this novel, resulting in an improvement in the overall quality of writing. 4 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson

0307592839|5.0|An exceptional novel with characters and situations unlike those I've ever encountered.  Gives true to life portrayals of disturbed but talented individuals attempting to find peace in their turbulent and interconnected lives.  Without question, this author has the unique ability to describe motives and feelings that anyone else would have difficulty putting into words. As such, this is a novel to be savored--it's not a page turner.  It reads a bit slowly but generates very high rewards.

B000FA5TTW|4.0|I enjoyed this book alot. You hear the story from Susie, a 14 year old gir who has been raped and even though I expected this book to be morbid, it was entertaining. Yet, there were many irrelevant details in the book. Overall, a great read.
0545123267|3.0|First, I loved the book.  But there are many other reviewers here who can tell you all the wonderful points a lot more eloquently than I can.  So I'll get to my point...  I bought this book at the same time as I preordered Linger and I was super excited to get it.  I read that the author had the books printed in the same color ink as the blue on the cover.  Upon opening my book.... black print.  Thinking maybe it was just Amazon, I checked my local stores and they do indeed have Shiver with the lovely blue writing in them, unfortunately for me.  So if you too would like the novelty of the blue ink, buy from your local bookstore and not on Amazon.<br /><br />EDIT:  Amazon is replacing my book and I'm sending mine back.  Cross your fingers for me that it comes in blue!

B002ZG97RE|4.0|I am definitely not a fan of military movies, but I really enjoyed this one.  It was intense, taut, and thought-provoking.  From the very first scene I felt like I was on an action-packed roller coaster ride that never stopped!      In this film, Matt Damon plays a U.S. Army Officer trying to find out the truth about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and decipher the real reason why the U.S. removed Sadam Hussain from power.  I understand that some people may not like this movie because it approaches the War on Terrorism from a more liberal agenda, but if you watch it with an understanding that is just an entertaining movie, you'll probably like the fast-paced, thrilling action and twisting plot surprises that fill the script through the very last scene.    If you are looking for a gritty movie with a bite, give The Green Zone a try.  You'll be fully engaged.
B002ZHKZEM|3.0|Honestly, the stories and acting were brilliant, and I have no fault with any of that.  What I DO have fault with is the fact that I was made to pay for 5 discs when the whole thing could have easily fit on one or two.  The reason for this is no doubt to make a bit of extra money, but I consider it price gouging.  I mean, the specials cost almost as much as a regular season, and the regular seasons had far more episodes, so that's my problem with this set and my only problem.
1878424505|1.0|The other one star reviews extensively cover the platitudinous nature of this book.  From a literary standpoint this book is written on a third grade level at best.  The entire book consists of repetitive, shallow messages written so poorly that such writing would not earn a passing grade as an elementary school writing assignment.  If you seek wisdom, enlightenment, or entertainment look elsewhere.
B000E41MS6|3.0|I thought this season was a great come back for Dr. Who.  I know that there was a gap between the last Dr. Who series (with Sylvester Mccoy) and the 90's movie, and another gap between the 90's movie and the new series.  I thought it was a great revival and it was good how they didn't waste time reinroducing the main themes and concepts of the series.  It has most of the elements which made the old series great plus modern special effects.  I say most of the elements because much of the new series is devoted to adventures on Earth while the older series seemed to involve more adventures on alien planets.  I kind of prefer going to alien planets more, but all of the episodes were still well written and executed.  I was also kind of put off by Captain Jack's gayness.  Fortunately they didn't show much but I didn't think it was inappropriate for something that is supposed to be a family TV show.  I also tend to think that using a big name entertainment franchise to further one's political agenda is a cheap shot.  So I don't think the first set is family friendly, but it's still fun to watch.

B001AP11L6|3.0|I don't know about calling two people a band but these two put out an amazing amount of blues rock music.  I believe other reviewers that this is one of their best albums and I liked it well enough to later purchase De Stijl.  Once in a while they really combine words and music to good effect but they have yet to really hit on both sides of the job to produce something like Bruce Springsteen did on Born to Run, etc.  Jack White is a 'guitar god' and just that could justify a purchase.  His cover of 'I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself' is almost over-the-top dramatic.  It is one of my favorite cuts on this album.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|I've got two words for you. Great joystick! I'm not one for reviews, to be honest, but I've enjoyed this so much that I felt I had to write a little something about it. First off, it's pretty responsive. There's a slight dead zone in the center, but with the right adjustment, you'll never notice. The throttle controls are great, even more responsive then the stick.     As for function, there are over 12 different buttons on this thing, not including the hat-switch or throttle controls, and out of the box this little beauty comes with software to customize each and every one. The software can be a little confusing though, so I would recommend Xpadder. [...] It's free, and I've used it with tons of other USB controls, works great. One thing though, don't bother looking for a picture of this particular joystick, there isn't one yet. (Not at the time I'm writing this, anyway.) If anyone finds or makes one, please feel free to post a link to it in the comments. I'd love a copy myself. ^_^  )    Now, when it comes to form, you'll love it even more. The Cyborg X is, like almost all Saitek products, fully customizable. You can adjust it to any ergonomic setting you need. There is a pair of small, but powerful, blue LEDs set in the top of the stick. These shine down upon the hat-switch and the four thumb-buttons, giving you a pretty good idea of what's what, no matter the lighting. (Plus it just looks sweet, surprised me when I first plugged it in, since there is nothing on the box or website which says anything about LEDs.)    There are two more little features that help the Cyborg X stand out. One is how portable it is. The stick unscrews from the base pretty easily, which really reduces the profile and lets you carry the entire thing in a backpack or computer bag without fear of breaking it off the stand. The second is the fact that the base folds up, reducing the size even more. It also makes it a lot easier to store on your desktop when it's not in use.    Reading thisfor spelling errors, I'm surprised how much I wrote. O_o Well, this lovely little piece deserves it, I won't be looking for any other 'sticks while this still works. One last note though, and I only mention this because I was stupid enough to do it. I know it's common buyer-sense, but shop around for the best price. I bought mine at Best Buy, and when I saw it here on amazon, I was surprised to see it cheaper. Not by much, but still, it's a lower price.    Happy gaming!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child does a fantastic job of building the story and characters.  The first person perspective adds great character depth to the book.  He doesn't give too much away too soon (i.e. no obvious foreshadowing and plot spoilers). I cannot wait to read the next &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; book.
0786856297|3.0|I decided to read this partly because I had just seen the movie and partly because I heard that it was a good series for fans of the Harry Potter series. Well, in regards to the movie, it's appalling how much the producers changed the book's plot to make the movie. If they make a second movie, I likely will not be interested, as I much more prefer the book's plot. In regards to the book's similarities to Harry Potter, they are vast, but really, who wouldn't aim to write something as popular and complex as the Harry Potter series? J.K. Rowling owns a castle! So, on to the actual book.<br />Years ago I thought that writing a fantasy series that uses Greek mythology would be a great idea, so I was excited when I heard of the Percy Jackson series. I love the modernized spin on the various good and bad characters, bringing them to life in both creative and believeable ways, such as Ares on a Harley and \\"Mr.\\" Charon wearing Italian suits. The \\"Gods\\" of mythology at times seemed more like immature teenagers or work-aholic parents, with as much flaws as any normal human, and I really appreciated that they were differentiated from The GOD early on, and their place in the known universe was explained in the context of Percy's world. I especially like the scene of Hephaestus' trap that Percy and Annabeth get caught in. How the \\"normal\\" humans explained away the activities of the mythological characters was probably the most creative of the whole text, and at times rather humorous. It actually makes me wonder how much of what I see everyday is only a cover for what is really happening in the spiritual realm.<br />The only element that really bugged me about the text was how Percy changed from this moody, victimized pre-teen to a rather mature young man with almost no transition - emotional or otherwise. It almost felt like Percy possessed two different personalities that shared the same body. While Percy often says that he did not want to be the son of Poseidon, I found evidence of inner termoil strangely absent throughout the text.  I also felt that there were smaller issues that could have been more detailed and developed, such as the characters of Grover and Annabeth. I will be continuing the series with The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 2) in the near future.ner termoil strangely absent throughout the text.

0767817710|4.0|I've watched this movie a number of times. Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio were still relatively early in their careers, Gene Hackman brings a veteran presence, and for me this was actually one of Sharon Stone's best performances.    This movie takes many classic western themes while also using some interesting camera angles and almost comedic gunshots to bring a bit of satire of those earlier westerns. Some people might not appreciate the lightheartedness of some scenes which takes away some of the seriousness of the movie. For me, the characters and gunslinging action are heightened by the occasional attempts by the movie to mock its subject.    For those who want a summary, I'll offer this. Sharon Stone rides into town with an attitude, and with hints of some history between her and Hackman's character. We're offered glimpses of this background as the story progresses. Gene Hackman is the cold-hearted businessman who controls all the money in the town, backed by hired guns. He holds a fast-draw contest and offers out a prize. The contest is only to draw his enemies in the open, where he can face them on even terms in the street. Hackman abducts Crowe, a former criminal partner who has turned to the priesthood, and forces him into his game. DiCaprio plays a Kid with a flamboyant attitude who claims to be Hackman's son, and enters the contest to prove himself. The main actors are backed by a number of other recognizable faces playing stand-out characters.    From there, there is plenty of memorable gun matches leading up to the final fast-draw.
0743298039|2.0|The key to understanding this novel is to realize, as early on as possible, that the characters are NOT human, but ALIEN (from which other planet, it is never made quite clear).      That way, you don't waste time trying to understand characters that are not remotely psychologically realistic, or understandably motivated.  You won't puzzle over children not subject to normal growth and development patterns -- growing from infancy to toddlerhood in a matter or hours/days and thence from an unclear, murky 7-going-on-13-ish stage to an impressively devloped adulthood in what could, at most, be two or three years.  You won't react with bewilderment to characters who flip from sane coherence to degenerate mental decay without sufficient cause.    Unfortunately, you may still be understandably annoyed with the large gaps left in the story.  Is the book badly written?  badly edited?  both?  it isn't clear.  But it is annoying.      There is a cool take on Cinderella at the end, though.  Too bad the book couldn't have told that story a little more clearly.
0061353248|5.0|Why do we always feel guilty after indulging in an \\"all you can eat\\" buffet ? Why do we feel bad when we throw things that we never use ? Why do we act irrationally and do stupid things when our emotions run  high ? To find answers to these puzzling, yet genuine questions author Dan Ariely conducts a series of in genuine experiments on his innocent human subjects, and comes out with answers that surprise most of us. Predictably Irrational is a book that explores certain frontiers of a nascent  field of study called behavioral economics, and tries to enlighten us as to why some of us, in spite of being successful, still make irrational decisions. Behavioral economics helps us understand that the decisions we make are not completely governed by the laws of economics, as they should be, but have much to do with how we perceive things and a host of other factors that govern us . He elucidates his point by saying that we are ready to pay certain X amount of dollars for a product A when it is manufactured by company X, but at the same time are not willing to pay the same price when the same product A is made by a different company Y.<br /><br />In his quest to understand the quirkiness about human behavior, Ariely - a professor at the Duke university and MIT -  comes up with a series of hypothesis and then proceeds to design experiments to validate these hypothesis. What really is interesting here is how the experiments were designed and results he got: In one experiment he places coke cans in an dorm refrigerator only to find them disappear in the next 72hrs, whereas when he puts $1 bills nobody takes them. From similar experiments, Ariely concludes that we humans tends to steal things that have a monetary value but suddenly feel guilty when it comes to stealing money itself.  In another instance he comes up with an hypothesis to find out if knowing beforehand about something really influences our opinion. He tests his theory by offering his subjects regular beer and beer laced with balsamic vinegar.  For the first group of people he doesn't tell them that the beer is laced with balsamic vinegar and then proceeds to find out if they really liked the beer. For the next group he tells them that the beer is laced with balsamic vinegar, and finds out that most of them don't like it even before trying it. Whereas, when the first group was informed that the beer they had was laced with balsamic vinegar, they did not mind trying if offered next time. Note that most of his subjects in these experiments are students at MIT, Harvard and other campuses who innocently walk into these experiments thinking that they are either getting free beer or candy or small change. Quoting many personal and professional experiences where he himself was a victim of the many experiments he now conducts, Ariely draws on a wealth of information to educate the reader how to not repeat the mistakes which are often repeated and makes the field of behavioral economics much interesting.<br /><br />Eloquent, witty and written in a style that is as lucid as it is engaging, author Ariely grips the reader with his amazing insight on some of the dilemmas we face everyday, and comes up with unique ideas that for most part offer a work around. But these ideas are also debatable. Ariely explores different areas of human behavior and effortlessly makes us feel good, bad and miserable at the same time. His appetite for curiosity insatiable and his willingness to experiment unflinching, Ariely takes his readers on a ride that not only makes them reflect on some of the past decisions they have taken, but more importantly make them say aloud in their mind: what was I thinking ?with balsamic vinegar.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|This DAC is decisively worth the money.     It arrived very quickly, nicely packed, and with useful accessories. The case is very well done and the display is sharp. When it comes to sound, it truly shines at this price. After about 30-40 hours of burn in, the quality is way above what the asking price suggests. The amp is also quite capable of driving even high impedance full size cans. I also love the fact that it has a build-in battery and is thus portable. I highly recommend it.

0545123283|5.0|Warning, this review may contain a lot of gushing!!!) Loved it, loved it, loved it! If I had a golden green bean award to give to books, I would give it to Linger. I wanted to read this in one sitting, but I made myself stop and put it down so I could savor it (which ok, I savored over two days instead of one-I couldn't help myself!)<br /><br />I read a lot of books and while I enjoy many of them and love a few, it's a rare book that makes me want to go back and re-read it again and again. But when I turned the last page of Linger, I knew I had to open it up again and start all over. I'm even getting it on audio so I can listen to it! Yep, I'm in love.<br /><br />Sequels often worry me, since many times they don't live up to the first book, but Linger surpassed my expectations and I liked it even better than Shiver. But it is a sequel, and while there is some recap, you really need to read Shiver first. Linger is told in four alternating voices-Grace and Sam, which we know from Shiver, yet this time around we have new wolf Cole, and Isabel, who has more of a starring role. I felt each of the characters had distinct voices and I could hear each character in my head as I was reading.<br /><br />The writing is tremendous and beautiful and magical. Maggie Steifvater has a way of pulling the reader in and evoking the character's emotions so perfectly that the reader feels them so strongly with each page turn. None of these characters are perfect, they are damaged and have flaws-and the writing lets you feel that with them. There are scenes that are so vivid (especially one involving Cole and a deer) that I don't know if I will ever forgive Ms. Stiefvater for because I can't get the image out of my mind. There were many points I was so caught up in the emotion of the novel I was close to tears-and I don't cry at books!<br /><br />I also like that we got to have four voices in this one. It's still Grace and Sam's story, but it's more than that. They are part of a bigger picture-the focus is not just their relationship and that's what makes the book work so well. Yes, this is a romance, but it's so much more. Isabel and Cole are interesting and add another depth to the story-especially Cole's background and past. Cole is a very flawed character, yet I'm intrigued by him. Isabel can be an ice queen, but she has a softer side she rarely lets anyone see, and she's a good compliment to Grace's perfect and organized personality.<br /><br />While the ending is given lots of foreshadowing throughout, the race to get there and figure out what is happening is so heartbreaking and beautiful and real, I didn't mind that I knew what was coming. My biggest gripe is the major cliffhanger ending, which is so not fair and I would have thrown the book across the room in frustraion if I hadn't wanted to turn the front and start all over. That's what's so great about Linger-I'm so wrapped up in the story that I can love it and hate it all at the same time.<br /><br />I'm even more excited for the third book, Forever, to be released next year!lationship and that's what makes the book work so well.

B000268QB2|5.0|It's a travesty that Keane was only nominated in the 48th Grammys for Best New Artist.  I've never raved about an artist and album in years but this work is evidently one of the best albums that ever came out so far in the new millenium.  When I first heard \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", I immediately bought the CD. I thought Keane had a fresh unique piano sound and melody that captured me.  A refreshing sound that went against the guitar-driven music which dominated the airwaves. Their album actually went to #1 in UK and won the BRIT awards. They also won Breakthrough Act. They only achieved minor success and recognition in the US but they were nominated for best new artist in the 2006 Grammys for this album which they should have won.  In fact they should have been nominated and won in other categories but the Grammys prefer to nominate well established artists like U2, Coldplay, Green Day, Bruce Springsteen, Mariah Carey, Rascal Flatts and Gwen Stefani.  They should have been nominated for Best Rock or Pop Performance by a Group, Best Rock Album, Song and Record of the Year (Somewhere Only We Know), and Best Alternative Music Album. Some of the artists nominated were only there because of name (Stevie Wonder? Bruce Springsteen? McCartney? These guys are way past their musical prime) or overrated (Kanye West, John Legend, Los Lonely Boys??!!).    Unfortunately, each subsequent album release by Keane gets worse than the previous one.  They slowly moved to a different sound and you can see this develop in albums succeeding 'Hopes and Fears'.  The melodic piano harmonics and synthesizers were gradually less utilized in every release and it culminated in the 4th album 'Night Train' which should have been named 'Night Train Wreck'.    Anyway, if you must listen to one CD by Keane, this is the one.  This is what made me a fan but the last two they had was just too out of their element.  The drastic direction they went is a disappointment to their real fans. 'Hopes and Fears'is to 'Joshua Tree\\" as 'Night Train' is to 'Zooropa'.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Endlessly inventive.  Thoroughly engaging.  Fascinatingly complex.  Thought-provoking.  Very entertaining.    These are the phrases I can apply to each of Christopher Nolan's films.  \\"Inception\\" is his 7th feature film, and it is a well-crafted thriller of the highest order.  It's almost impossible to describe this movie, because there really isn't a whole lot like it.  Sure, there are elements of \\"The Matrix\\" when the characters dig into their own minds, or the James Bond 007 series when the action sequences kick into the final stretch of the story.  But \\"Inception\\" cannot be reduced to those other pictures; the story is unique because of HOW it's told.    Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb (the same name for Nolan's thief in the criminally-overlooked \\"Following\\").  Cobb is a thief of the most unusual kind: He's paid to steal the secrets of powerful men.  From the getgo, \\"Inception\\" challenges and demands you give your full attention.  Fans of \\"The Prestige\\" and \\"Memento\\" will sink into this mindset relatively quick, as Cobb's attempts to steal from Saito (Ken Watanabe) become increasingly complicated when a few characters begin to resist Cobb's mental theft.  The targets begin to shoot back.  A woman from Cobb's past sabotages his efforts.  The dream world begins to collapse.    After the operation has gone sour, Saito still enlists Cobb to work for him to complete another job is by assuring him that he will be allowed to see his estranged family after being exiled for reasons I won't reveal.  The catch: Cobb and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) must perform 'inception', meaning to insert an idea into Saito's rival for his own personal gain.    Viewers may become initially lost at the outset, but like watching a Shakespearean play or sitting through a season of \\"The Wire\\", if you remain patient and just catch the jist of the scene, you'll catch the hidden subtleties as the story progresses.  \\"Inception\\" isn't an impenetrable mind-bender, but it moves at a swift pace for its 2 and 1/2 hour duration.  Thankfully, there is an early sequence where Cobb enlists a new architect (Ellen Page), where we begin to understand how this dream invasion is even remotely possible.  What are the rules?  The objectives?  The risks?  This sequence where Paris is reassembled in front of our eyes is very well-written for the viewers' convenience.    As Cobb assembles a team to invade Saito's target, his inner demons and complexities reveal their ugly heads as the planning begins.  As with most action thrillers with a team of protagonists, things go horribly wrong.    I don't want to reveal what exactly happens and why it happens, but I think it's fair to tell you that the first half is pretty much the setup of the Inception, while the second half is the execution of the plan while the team faces unforseen risks.  Throw in Cobb's confrontations with his dark past while immersed in the dream world, \\"Inception\\" becomes a very tricky balancing act of drama and thriller, and Christopher Nolan is equal to the task....Mostly...    Before I get into my quibbles with \\"Inception\\", I want to be clear:  This is a first-rate picture from a masterful filmmaker.  Audiences should see it, and audiences will certainly enjoy it.  Where \\"Inception\\" is going to be nitpicked is whether this is indeed a masterpiece, and in my opinion, it isn't.  This has nothing to do with the insurmountable praise from \\"The Dark Knight\\" or the indie smash \\"Memento\\".  The flaws from \\"Inception\\" belong only to \\"Inception\\", regardless of Nolan's prior work.    There is one basic element that I thought could've been better:  \\"Inception\\" is simply too long.  To address Nolan's previous work, his two Batman features were lengthy pictures as well.  But in those two movies, the plot was constantly moving and evolving.  There simply wasn't any way to keep all of those storylines and make the movies shorter.  \\"Inception\\" would be just as, if not more, effective if it were trimmed a bit.  The stunning action sequences are simply too long in the final act, and even the dramatic revelations and conclusions are too long.  Considering how the story ends and where our characters end up, the film's 144-minute length isn't fully justified.    Everyone will admire \\"Inception\\"'s exciting action stunts & shootouts, and the dramatic payoff of the story.  But I believe most fans will love one of those elements, and simply 'LIKE' the other.  I'm not convinced that \\"Inception\\" is going to be universally praised for both of those aspects.    However, with \\"Inception\\", it's biggest problem is that it has too much of a few good things.  In this case, less would've been more.  But whereas most blockbusters don't earn their lengthy running time, \\"Inception\\" is a such a terrific piece of entertainment that it's not a deal-breaker.  I once read a quote from Roger Ebert, \\"No good movie is too long, and no bad movie is too short.\\"  Christopher Nolan's latest work is a very good film, and it is a bit too long.  But Nolan's enormous talent is stunning enough to tolerate the excesses of his latest acheivement.  Ellen Page's rookie becomes so drawn into the dream exploration because \\"It's pure creation\\", and so are we.    \\"Inception\\" is a marvelous piece of pure creation from one of the cinema's most gifted talents.

B003LXM1RS|4.0|The Scissor Sisters third album, \\"Night Work,\\" is their most derivative album to date. It's also their most cohesive album to date. They want to party like it's 1985. They want you to stop looking back in anger. They really, really want you to dance.<br /><br />\\"Night Work\\" grabs you by the arm and throws you into a sweaty, pulsing old school disco. If it was any more retro, they could have put a Casablanca Records label on it. And it's finally the a;bum where they do their idols proud. Listen closely and you'll catch Kraftwerk, The Pet Shop Boys, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller,\\" a whole bunch of Elton and Giorgio Moroder. As such, it's a total blast from start to stop.<br /><br />The Scissor Sisters haven't even just copies the obvious. \\"Harder You Get\\" mimics the oddball gay classic \\"Walk The Night\\" from The Skatt Brothers (there's a Casablanca reference again) in its sinister, slinky kinkiness. \\"Something Like This\\" knicks \\"Radioactivity\\" from Kraftwerk. Then Sir Ian McKellen goes all Vincent Price on us at the end of \\"Invisible Light\\" and does a \\"Thriller\\" rap on top of a song that splits the difference between Frankie Goes the The Pet Shop.<br /><br />Yet there's one moment where Jake Shears transcends the mirror ball and gets higher than he has on any prior SS Song. \\"Fire With Fire,\\" a power ballad about survival, tosses aside all the kitsch and camp and aims for the stars. It's pure emotion, song from the heart, and nails the core of what \\"Night Work\\" is about; the lost generation the Jake Shears fantasized about if The Lost AIDs generation was still with us. It's the most realistic song they've made to date, and adds another notch to an album that will probably end up in my top five favorites of 2010.

0743454537|3.0|My Sister's Keeper is about a girl named Anna Fitzgerald who was genetically engineered to be a perfect match for her dying sister. From the time of her birth, she has been forced to donate parts of her body in the hopes of keeping her sister Kate alive. Kate has leukemia, and every time they fix one part of her, something else seems to go wrong. In fact, I think Kate says this exact thing at one point in the book. The central dilemma occurs when Anna is expected to donate her kidney to her sister who has now experienced renal failure. Anna finds an attorney named Campbell Alexander to plead her case. She wants to be a normal child. She's tired of being her sister's on-call organ donor.     It's an interesting concept, and a true ethical dilemma. The only thing is that the situations Picoult tends to contrive are often very formulaic. And it's like watching a horror movie and seeing the zipper on the monster. You know you're being manipulated. The ending is the best example of this. I understand why Picoult ended the book the way she did. There was literally no other way to end it. It's hard to end such a story because you've pretty much given away all your tricks before the reader even reads the first page. The reader knows what this book is about the second they read the plot summary, and there's really nothing more they can learn about it by reading the pages within the book because any answers the author can give would be pat or predictable.  This is the dilemma with books structured around a moral question. You can learn to care about the characters, you can get a window into what their life is like, but there's no door out, which is a huge problem when the story promises an epiphany that it can't deliver.  And that's the prime reason why books should be about characters, not issues. Reading such a book as this is like finding yourself trapped in a claustrophobic little house with no door. So Picoult had to hatchet her way through the wall in order to get the reader out of the story. The shocker ending felt like a cheap shot. A little judiciously placed irony is OK, but deus ex machina (in other words, good old-fashioned plot manipulation) is another story altogether.     Another problem I had was with the multiple points of views. I understood the story being told from the different povs of the family members. But Campbell's and Julia's subplot was just distracting. I'm sorry, but a high school romance gone wrong is not at all like a family being torn apart by cancer, and nobody can convince me otherwise. The two plotlines are not similar enough to warrant being in the same book together, unless the high school relationship is between two cancer-stricken kids. Maybe Picoult could have written the subplot with Campbell and Julia in a way that would have made their high school romance relevant (I don't want to completely close the door on that possibility), but the way she did write it, it felt like it was just romantic padding to an already sensationalistic story. I didn't think that the relationship between Julia and her twin was necessary either. We didn't need to read about yet another pair of siblings and their idiosyncratic relationship. That plotline with Julia and her sister was just not relevant to the story. Picoult should have just focused on Anna and Kate---there's enough in that relationship to fill an entire book. Seriously, use the extra pages gained by axing the irrelevant sideplots to let us know what Anna and Kate say to each other at night before they go to sleep, and do it long before we get to the ending. Don't have their private conversations be a revelation on the witness stand. I'll get to Picoult's coyness further down, though. I don't think Picoult has all of these excess characters in her books because she wants to enhance the story. I think she just has so many cool ideas and is not able to be discriminatory. And important plot points inevitably get pushed aside because she gets so caught up indetails that aren't important. She's so in love with all aspects of her little world, and that's good, but she's in love with her fictional world to a fault. Someone really needs to tell her that not everyone who walks into a book deserves a point of view. I'm sure she knows this in her heart, and I understand that putting theory into action can be difficult when it comes to your own characters. Seriously, this is the way it is with her books. \\"I'm going to give little Pixie a psychiatrist to help her through her day to day problems. But wouldn't it be interesting if the psychiatrist is a stripper by night? I wonder how I can interweave that storyline within the one I'm already writing?\\"  Maybe I'm being unfair.  That's just how it comes across to me. And the worst thing is that she never lives up to her end of the bargain by truly getting into these characters' heads. She wants to dabble in their thought processes, but won't even reveal to us something as simple as why they happen to be walking around town with a service dog. We shouldn't be feeling like the characters are being secretive if we're in their heads.  And it often seems that Picoult is so fixated on metaphors and larger philosophical questions that she forgets that she should be telling the story. And then she gets to the end of the book, needs to cram in all the storytelling she neglected for the past hundreds of pages, and packs it into a witness stand confession.     OK, I've been critical enough. I really loved the way Picoult showed the way in which this family was falling apart at the seams. And her prose is usually quite beautiful. I do have to say, however, that some major editing in regards to Campbell, Julia and the ending would have been much appreciated. This is my opinion, though.     I think that Picoult has the potential to write beautiful stories. I think she needs to give the ripped from the headlines subject matter a rest, though.  She should write more books like \\"Songs of the Humpback Whale\\". Of course, she won't give up the courtroom dramas, though, because that's become her thing.  And all my complaints aside, if ripped from the headline stories work for her, well then, that's what she should be doing.  I'm not trying to say otherwise.  I just think her novels often leave much to be desired.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|FlashForward was a gripping show.  A good LOST replacement for addicts such as myself.  Part 1 of season 1 is a good starter, but the entire season will be even better.  Hopefully someone will pay for at least a second season.  If you have not seen this show yet, you will be pleasantly surprised.  It is a gripping show all the way to the end.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this workout video after working out to it at a friends house.  It is an intensive workout that you can finish in 20 minutes which is awesome for me with two little ones to care for.  I like that it has three levels so you can move up to the more intense workouts after you are used to the first level.  The only complaint I have about the video is Jillian doesn't provide clear details on when you should really move up to the more intense levels.  Overall, this video challenges me and I get a good workout done in 20 minutes, I would recommend it.
0399156577|5.0|Finally, I have been so disappointed in the last few Nora Roberts books but I love this one. Despite other reviews, I like the dog training parts because lets face it the herione trains dogs in search and rescue. As for Simon - not your usual male character but rough around the edges and doing his own thing - got to like that. I would be bored out of my mind with information on making furniture. To me the star of the book is the puppy Jaws - got to love him. You have a strong female character and a strong male character and you have a excellent book and the dogs are a big plus.  This is from a reader who has four cats but still looking for the special dog.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|This show was NOT meant to be a one season show. This show is one of the best things I've seen in a while and needs to be brought back to air. I love FlashFoward so much. The plot is beautifully written and leaves me at the edge of my seat. Unlike a lot of shows that either lose you because it doesn't make sense or is beyond predictable, this show is the perfect mix of not only making sense but not being predictable. Highly recommend this buy.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971) is a delightful story with great music that can be viewed repeatedly by both children and adults. And though children and adults will like it for different reasons, it's colorful and enduring. Not so with CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Even though I'm a dedicated Depp fan, this movie is only mildly entertaining and the squirrels manage to steal the show. Perhaps most disappointing is the dreadful music and the muted colors. It isn't magical...it's dysfunctional. Gene Wilder, though wary of children in general, is always in charge, and always entertaining. (One reviewer said \\"cuddly\\".) Depp is simply an Edward Scissorhands in charge of a chocolate factory. Burton does his best to add humor to the film, but in the end one usually only remembers the squirrels and the children, not Depp. Sadly, this film is lacking in the very things it should have been rich in. It's like Jan de Bont and THE HAUNTING (1999). Why pick a director who knows nothing about psychological horror to recreate a thriller where psychological horror is at the very heart and soul of the story? In this case, think of Don Knotts as Achilles in about the same way as Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. The humor doesn't work because the film is, at its core, humorless.<br /><br />The 1971 film is so good in so many ways that it's amazing they thought to remake it. Why waste the money when there are so many other good ideas? But the squirrels were great.

B003ODL004|4.0|I haven't been able to stop listening to Hans Zimmer's captivating score for INCEPTION.    Inception is one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. Although slightly reminiscent of his BATMAN work, and with one track echoing THE THIN RED LINE (check out \\"Time\\" from INCEPTION and \\"Journey to the Line \\" from THE THIN RED LINE to hear what I'm talking about), Zimmer has created a masterpiece that will go down as one of his most original compositions in recent years.    Expertly juxtaposing bombastic cues typical of his work along with musical moments of utter beauty and simplicity, Zimmer demonstrates yet again why he is one of the most versatile composers working in film today.    I could go on and on describing each track. But why do that to music? Words rarely do justice to music, especially when it comes to a score as evocative as this one. I have yet to see INCEPTION (it opens this Friday), but I know it has to do with dreams. Zimmer's alluring score is like a dream: haunting, surreal. Unlike a dream, however, it will linger in your mind long after you've stopped listening.
B003ODL004|5.0|The soundtrack to \\"Inception\\" is brilliant! All of the tracks are brilliant! This is one of the best scores / soundtracks of the year, if not, the best, to one of the most anticipated movies of the summer and of the year. This is another brilliant Hans Zimmer score.

B0031ZWZR2|4.0|FlashForward is a great thrilling TV show. It has everything a good show must have - great script, brilliant cast, fast pace, intriguing plot turns, beautiful cinematography, great drama.. It raises questions, it makes you think what would you do if you saw a glimpse of your own future? Especially when it is not what you would like it to be (for example, a loving wife seeing herself in a relationship with another man, a career woman seeing herself pregnant, a former alcoholic seeing himself drinking again..) For me it is almost perfect. Gave it four stars because it was canceled. I do hope though that ABC or some other television continues it..
B002ZG980U|5.0|\\"What's the most resilient parasite? An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules.\\"<br /><br />And with that premise comes Inception- the latest slice of psychological brilliance from director Christopher Nolan to hit the theaters.  It's a well-layered, dynamically intriguing landscape of a story that absolutely seizes your attention. In this near-future vision of the world Dream Share Technology is a high-end field of both private enterprise and corporate espionage, so much so that CEO's and the like are often trained to resist it.<br /><br />The movie opens with Cobb (DiCaprio), an Extractor- who makes his living stealing people's secrets from their minds while they're dreaming.  He and his team had been hired to enter the mind of Saito (Ken Watanabe), but the job is disrupted by Mal (Marion Cotillard), the ghost of Cobb's late wife who haunts his own psyche, forcing them to hide from their employer.  But unbeknownst to them Saito was also auditioning them for his own purposes: he wants them to perform not an extraction but an 'inception'- planting an idea within someone's mind- on a business rival, Fischer (Cillian Murphy).  The trick of an inception is in making the subject believe they conceived it themselves, otherwise their subconscious will reject it.  The concept of an inception is extremely radical and considered only a theory, but Cobb knows it can be done... because he's done it before.  Once.<br /><br />Time is also a factor as a subconscious mind will eventually perceive the intruders and attack them relentlessly.  Success demands extreme skills and delicate navigation of the subject's psyche.  Cobb and Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) the Point Man, who researches their targets, recruit associates old and new- Eames (Tom Hardy) is the Forger, who can assume a specific identity within the dream; Ariadne (Page) is the Architect, who constructs the dreamscape to fit the team's needs; Yusuf (Dileep Rao) is the Chemist, who supplies the drugs needed to keep them all in the dream state.  Saito also accompanies them into the dream as they all have specific roles to fill once within Fischer's mind.  It's very much a Matrix version of Mission Impossible with some Dark City thrown in.<br /><br />To both complete the mission and escape successfully they must create a dream within the dream- a very unstable platform- taking them even deeper within Fischer's mind to manipulate him.  But the sins of the past continue to haunt Cobb as Mal reappears yet again to sabotage their plan and steals Fischer for her own purposes.<br /><br />The sub-plot and character arcs are equally compelling: Cobb's relationship with Mal is critical to the story, driving him to extremes that put everyone at risk, as well as giving Saito the leverage he needs to push Cobb into accepting the assignment.  The genius of Nolan's script is the fact that the opening quote lies at the core of the entire film.<br /><br />Characterizations were brilliant as well: having never been a fan of Dicaprio I am after seeing this movie.  Page did good work as DiCaprio's character foil- both providing the audience's viewpoint and juxtaposing his dilemma.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy played off each other well as men with opposing personalities.  The special effects were amazing; the visuals wholly appropriate to a dream reality.  Even the soundtrack was effective; Zimmer's synth, horn and percussion arrangements complimented the on-screen action perfectly.  If there's one- and only one- real complaint here is that it's too long; clocking in at 2 ½ hours, there were several places where cuts could have been made and trimmed a good twenty minutes off without missing a trick.  Other than that this is a helluva mind scramble, and reminds you of just how good movies can be.hemist, who supplies the drugs needed to keep them all in the dream state.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan has topped his masterpiece 'The Dark Knight'.  In tradition with 'Memento' (directed by Nolan), Nolan starts the movie with part of the ending and then thrusts the audience into a real world problem with a dream solution.  Dom Dobbs (Leonardo DiCaprio) and crew, Arthur the Point Man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne the Architect (Ellen Page), Eames the Forger (Tom Hardy), Saito the Employer (Ken Watanabe), embark on what seems to be an impossible mission, 'inception'.  His team must implant an idea into Robert Fisher's (Cillian Murphy) mind in the dream state to trigger an 'action' in reality.  The concept is fresh and awe-inspiring.  The originality and the perfection of pulling it off will make this movie one of the top sci-fi films ever made.  The visual effects were imaginative, complex, stunning, basically took my breath away.  If you want edge of your seat entertainment, you got it.  I will warn, this is a dramatic movie (not many laughing moments), but that only increases the intensity of this fast-paced, slow-motion juggernaut.  Definitely worth the price to go and see.  The ending will leave you questioning (that is all I will say). 5 out of 5 stars!!!!!
0307588335|4.0|I don't normally like traders and especially people who made money off everyone else's misery by shorting anything touching mortgages in 2008, but you have to respect their work none-the-less.<br /><br />I have read numerous books about the collapse of the credit markets in 2008, the bailouts, etc including Lewis' the Big Short, Cohen's House of Cards and Sorkin's Too Big to Fail. I have a 15 year career in banking and risk management and thoroughly enjoy reading about what was surely the most cataclysmic couple of years in economic history.  McDonald's book was actually not my first choice but the library was wait-listing me on Devil's Casino so I grabbed this. First chapter or so, I wanted to gag. McDonald, like most traders I've worked with over the years, is way high on HIMSELF. But then I found I was impressed with his writing style and astute observations about banking and the business world in general. He's definitely wiser than the traders I worked with at large commercial banks or have read about. I would put this book somewhere below Too Big to Fail and about even with the Big Short and definitely ahead of House of Cards. McDonald is different than Sorkin or the rest in that he tells the story from inside Lehman with the perspective of a seasoned mid-high level bond trader/executive with access to some of the decision makers we have all heard about in other books. In addition, McDonald worked his way up and earned his chops (literally-- selling meat out of his car for a few years) in Philadelphia before moving onward and upward to Wall Street. Chapter after chapter, I came to respect him and enjoy his interpretation of events.  I love how he goes into the blinding jealousy Fuld and other top executives with Lehman had for Goldman Sachs and Blackrock. I could not agree more. There is TONS of insane envy of those two firms in the financial world. Goldman envy affects every decision made by the others down the food chain. I also enjoyed the description of the New Century and Countrywide mortgage brokers as \\"body builders\\". Truly amazing that to trade the mortgage bonds one had to have the Series 7 license but the body builders just showed up and started selling.<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes:<br />Regarding the mortgage desk at Lehman: \\"Empty cans make the most noise\\"<br /><br />When Lehman moved to their 7th Street office years back: \\"It was like moving a cathedral. The real estate was different but the holiness remained.\\" This helped me see that money is this guy's religion. Like so many on Wall Street. Humbling to say the least!<br /><br />On Fuld and Gregory: \\"Lehman's Board room gave them status and each of them liked that at least as much as cash.\\"<br />\\"The words of paper tigers. Silly really. Big thoughts from little people.\\"<br /><br />Rating Agencies: \\"Some of the ratings had been issued on the south side of ridiculous.\\"<br /><br />Paulson's view of Lehman on that horrible September weekend when Lehman's fate was sealed and Merrill Lynch was forced into marriage with BofA: \\"...had arrogantly foisted  most of their troubles on themselves and should just go away.\\"<br /><br />Freddie and Fannie: \\"...surely the most gruesomely misleading companies since Enron.\\"<br /><br />Buy it, read it, learn it.

B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was a page turner to say the least. Wonderfully written and captivating. This was a great first book for my Kindle. I would like to see this story made into a movie. Wolves, secrets, action, and romance. What more can you ask for? I can not wait to read Linger!
030745455X|3.0|I dont understand why this book is getting such mass amounts of hype? Maybe the general public has just dumbed down a lot.  This books reads really easily, but lacks in any sort of amazing story.  Salander is your typical girl filled with angst because of her childhood.  Watch any crime show on TV these days (CSI, Criminal Minds, etc) and you get much of the same. This book is basically a super long, and sometimes quite boring, written episode of one of the TV series.  Nothing too thrilling or shocking here at all.  Its obvious what the motive is for the killings right off the bat.  Did we really need another 500 pages to explain it to us?  There are also so many \\"coincidences\\" in this book its ridiculous.  People in the same place at the same time even though they have never seen each other before.  Its just too much to take seriously.  I did enjoy is a little bit though.  I guess the easy reading part of it made it very easy to read at the airport or during lunch out at a restaurant.  Not sure Ill read the next one in the series though....who knows, maybe it will be better than this one.

B000B63IEI|4.0|This is a complete, engaging, clear and sparse recording of perhaps the most famous piano concerto in the repertoire, alongside one of Rachmaninov's more underrated works. I recommend it highly, but not for a first time listener who I feel would be better served with Ashkenazy's recordings.<br /><br />A pianist approaching Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto seeks to imprint their name on the music, but what good is that when Rachmaninov is all we can remember? In that respect, then, a successful modern recording is one that avoids bravado and ego, and looks to draw the music gracefully through its paces, to let the listener draw their own conclusion. This is what Andsnes and Pappano achieve in this highly elegant recording.<br /><br />I cannot hear a note misplaced in the entire recording, and better still, I can hear every single note played - much easier said than done, when there are so many notes to play in quick succession or at the same time. Andsnes holds the melodic thread and intensity extremely well.<br /><br />This goes for the 1st as much as the 2nd. The former definitely sounds like a \\"first\\" - there is a sense of themes being wrestled with, rather than conquered as the second achieves - and Andsnes in that respect is justifiably a little wilder with his playing here.<br /><br />If I lack something, it is what I'd like to call the \\"Horowitz effect\\" - the sense that the piano is smoking throughout the piece and only the inhuman efforts of the pianist get it to the finish line. This is a piece brought to graceful completion, the pianist very much in control, and this makes for a wonderful listen that has me shaking my head each time, wondering whether I perhaps just skipped a little bit here or there...
1400064287|5.0|I selected this book to read and review for an education class, which is why the below review is education-focused:<br /><br />*Introduction and summary*<br />Chip and Dan Heath are brothers who came together from different backgrounds to write an effective book about how to communicate ideas so that they \\"stick.\\" Dan's field of work is education, having founded a text publishing company called Thinkwell and having researched the best ways to make effective instruction stick. Meanwhile, Chip's focus as a Stanford University professor is social marketing. This diversity in backgrounds and their common interest in researching communication resulted in a range of examples peppered throughout the text: \\"sticky\\" ideas from fields of education to urban legends and from the entertainment industry to business strategy.<br /><br />In the introductory chapter, the authors introduce their acronym for successful ideas: a SUCCESs, which stands for a Simple Unexpected Concrete Credentialed Emotional Story. Throughout the rest of the book, they expound upon each of those items (i.e. the first chapter is titled \\"Simple\\" and so on), both telling what they mean and showing through a variety of examples. Additionally, a common thread - the book's villain, if you will - is what the writers call the Curse of Knowledge; simply put, this means that you can't unlearn what you know which makes it difficult to place yourself in an unknowing audiences' shoes.<br /><br />A couple additional features worth mentioning are the easy reference guide and the post-epilogue addition of trade-specific sticky advice, including a section titled Teaching that Sticks. The easy reference guide is a five-page appendix with a brief list of key principles and illustrations for each chapter. It was useful in writing this report, but I also expect it to be useful as a resource in the future. And while the book has teaching examples throughout it, the aforementioned section contains 15 pages that specifically unpack the author's ideas for teachers.<br /><br />*Examples of effective communication*<br />The author's excelled in presenting well-researched exemplars for each principle, which made it a challenge for me to select a few key examples. One that stands out is the story of Nora Ephron's journalism teacher (pp. 75-76) who used an assignment with a surprise element to teach students how to write a lead for an article. She presented facts about an all-faculty conference on the upcoming Thursday and asked the new students to take a stab at the lead. All students honed in on the details, but none wrote the real lead for the story which could be derived from the facts: that there would be no school for students on Thursday. This example, used to illustrate the communication principle \\"Unexpected,\\" showed how a lesson by a journalism teacher stuck with a future screenwriter by utilizing an unforeseen twist.<br /><br />In the chapter about emotion, the authors explain how credibility isn't enough when it comes to motivating youth not to smoke; they know the facts, but many still do it. Emotional campaigns, though, ones that put faces on victims or pile up body bags (like the Truth campaign does in their commercials), stuck with teenagers. Another key example provided, in the chapter titled Stories, is that of the Jared campaign for Subway, which not only conveys how a story makes a message stick but also points out that sticky ideas often need to be found rather than created. An advertiser heard about Jared's story from a store manager and produced the ads for free when Subway's corporate offices weren't initially interested. This reaped great benefit once Jared's story caught on and hit national news (causing Subway executives to swallow their pride), but the manager and creative director didn't have to hold a brainstorming session or any other creative endeavor to come up with the idea. They just had to recognize it and take some risks to get it out to the public.<br /><br/>*Ways that communication strategies could be applied in education*<br />The example of Jared applies to teachers as well: often we don't need to create new strategies or lessons or ideas but rather need to network and collaborate with others who are already using them. Jared's example isn't education-specific, but it applies well. However, I don't need to reach far to find other examples from the book that make sense in education, given that one of the authors is involved in education. As mentioned above, an entire section of the book's appendix speaks directly to ways that these principles could be used in the classroom. Not only does it add additional examples of each principle in practice in a classroom setting, it also refers the reader back to ranges of pages that are specifically applicable to teachers.<br /><br />That appendix provides an example of a teacher using simple visual cues to help students remember the key points in his digital signal processing course (pp. 266-267). Another illustration (pp. 80-82) describes how an astronomer unexpectedly used mystery in an article about frozen dust on Saturn's rings to hook a non-scientific reader, a strategy that could be used to teach disinterested students. The authors mention ten pages later that a detective plot could be used by a chemistry teacher to engage students in a lesson about the periodic table by telling the story of Mendeleyev's work to organize the elements (p. 92). Later (pp. 104-106) they offer an analysis of strategies used by teachers in East Asia and the United States and found that teachers in Japan were more likely to use concrete examples to teach subtraction. Each chapter includes a clinic in which an example or non-example are contrasted; for the chapter called Emotional, three examples are provided - one poor, one mediocre, and one exemplar - to answer the question, \\"When are we going to use algebra in the real world?\\" One provides a trade organizations list of answers, which are meaningless to anyone outside of the field; another provides a list of relevant reasons for students but doesn't compel students beyond a survival reasoning of having to study it for school. The final one surprises students, declaring that they'll never, or at least rarely, use it in real life but that they will benefit from the mental weight training, using a football metaphor to drive that point home.<br /><br />*Action steps*<br />Despite the extensive teaching-related examples, this isn't an education book. Neither of my friends who recommended it work in education. However, I would love to see this integrated in pre-service teacher training or in-service professional development. Thus my first action step for other teacher is simple, though not unexpected if you've been reading all this time: Read it!

B0007KS7D0|4.0|You are going to get what you pay for: A decent piece of glass that is easy to clip onto a lens.   It has a very shallow depth-of-field and requires manual focusing, although auto-focus can be used for approximation.  You need time, stabilty, and proximity to use this lens.   It is not a macro lens (only focuses in center) but serves a macro function.  The advantage of not using an extension tube is that you do not have to fiddle with the lens.   I was quite surprised that this worked with my Nikon 70-300mm VR zoom.  It also works with my 55mm f2.8 manual focus.   I can see that the DCR- 250 may be more difficult to focus due to DOF.   I reommend that a DOF preview button is used to ensure that you get the picture you want.

I've watched every single episode and have no comprehension why so many are disappointed? There are just unexplained mysteries in the universe, deal with it!! haha. There are many answers if you research things more so I suggest that to those that don't understand or whatever? Season Six Rules!!!    LONG LIVE LOST!!!
B003ODL004|5.0|Listening to film music, I've found that the \\"great\\" composers adapt to the story ... and to their director's vision. I've liked a lot of Hans Zimmer's scores over the years, but not \\"on purpose\\". I thought he was more of a \\"corporate\\" composer (i.e., Pirates of the Caribbean), doing big-budget and obvious scores. But then I started to really listen to his work. I really liked Mission Impossible II ... I liked his mix of Spanish influences and electronica (who can do that!!? = Hans, I learned). Batman Begins (w/ James Newton Howard, one of my favorites) was \\"great\\". I didn't think they'd top that. Then ... The Dark Knight. Outside the box in so many ways. I've listened to it constantly since it was released. Then, he surprised me with Sherlock Holmes! WOW! Completely unexpected! That's when I realized that this guy really absorbs what the director is trying to do .. and then contributes what he can with the score. That SH score really rounded out that film.    Inception is outstanding. I agree that \\"Dream is Collapsing\\" is the most memorable song. And I'd counter that \\"Mombasa\\" is not what you were expecting ... but then becomes very powerful. The rest is an aural journey into one's imagination. I hear echoes of Tubular Bells, The Last Emperor, The Saint, great chase scenes, and some faceless sci-fi films (not sure which ones, but the musical cues are there). I even hear Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon in \\"Waiting for a Train\\". I realized that since the film has not been released yet at the time of me writing this, that in the meantime I've created images and story lines in my mind. In fact, though I know this film will be amazing, I'll be a little saddened when the actual film's imagery replaces mine. It is a soundtrack to the imagination ... or perhaps ... dreams. :)

B0032JTV6U|4.0|For those who originally purchased the first part of season 1 in \\"Glee Season 1, Vol. 1 - The Road to Sectionals\\", you have a couple of options. You can either order \\"Glee Season 1, Vol. 2 - The Road to Regionals\\" (also currently available for pre-order on Amazon) or Fox has also offered a $10 coupon for you.     I believe the idea behind Fox releasing only the first part of season 1 had to do with the long mid-season break. People were eager to have their DVDs for all those months they spent waiting, but Fox couldn't very well sell them unaired episodes.    Other than that, this DVD set looks like it's going to be great!

I'm holding back from giving the book 5 stars because I would have liked to see more discussion about boot-strapping. This section was good, but a little too light on detail.
037582913X|5.0|My sister bought this book for my son who is now 17 months old.  This was one of my favorite books to read as well as my sister when we were kids and we're in our 30's now.  Who would have thought it would still be published and loved by kids now?  I read it to my son and he loves it too!  It has silly drama from Grover, who is paranoid that you will keep turning pages and get him face to face with a monster.  It has great illustrations of brick walls and ropes and other things that Grover builds, along with his pleas, to try to keep you from turning the page.  A great addition to your Little Golden Book collection or any young kid's book collection.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|I'm a longtime Roots fan, and I haven't been addicted to a new release like this since Thing Fall Apart. This album plays like the antithesis of synthesized beats and Auto-Tune. Every track is good. The albums plays like one long mid-tempo groove. Questlove's beats are raw and funky. Tariq is in the zone -- his rhymes are clear, powerful, and delivered without the faintest sense of artifice. Instrumentation is sparse and soulful. This is exactly I needed.
1843106698|5.0|A clinical Psychologist recoimmended this book to me to help me get a grasp on Asperger's Syndrome, which my grandchild has been diagnosed recently as having.  I found the book to answer questions that other sources failed to address.  It is a handy reference if you do not wish to read it cover to cover, but I will read all of it.  It distinguishes Asperger's from other forms of autism on the spectrum and is more empowering than other books that dwell on the more dysfunctional ranges of autism.  It raises questions that still need to be addressed about categories and approaches to the diagnosis. It is easy reading and it is a great resource for someone who hears terms being used without any reference points.  Lillian Beeson, Ph.D.

But, don't worry if you have little to no knowledge of Greek myths, this movie does a great job of introducing it to you. If you are like me and know more than the average joe, there are a few fun hidden gems to discover, almost like some inside jokes only we would laugh at.<br />Now, I know this is based on a kids book, but I never read the book, so I can't compare/contrast it.

It was a little harder to get through, and suprisingly, there was a homosexual undertone between the two men that I picked up, but some classmates did not.

I was watching the night that happened and I can't stand to see it, so be forewarned. I also highly doubt that Bullock's character in real life would have been at the boy's practices and carried on like she did.Tim Mcgraw was superb. He is a much better actor than a singer.Definitely worth watching.
1591843162|1.0|I've never written a review on Amazon before but feel compelled to after throwing in the towel on this book 80 pages into it.  I'm mystified that so many reviewers enjoyed this book so much.  I felt like I was being shouted at throughout those 80 pages and told the same thing again and again and again.  To me, the book felt like little more than a series of sound bites anchored around a theme but not tied together well at all.  The examples, which I usually love in a book, often weren't explained well enough for me to fully get the point if I wasn't already familiar with the person.    I just finished two other business books that I really enjoyed, Drive by Dan Pink, and Switch by Chip and Dan Heath.  This book wasn't even close to the caliber of those and isn't worth your money or your time.
0800141601|4.0|I purchased this movie for my handicapped daughter.  She loves Richard Gere and has already watched this movie twice since she got it about 3 weeks ago.  This movie is a slightly different version of the story of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere.  It has a lot of action scenes and a satisfying love story.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|As an action flick and thriller, it succeeds very well and right from the moment you press \\"play\\".  Message-wise it is also interesting.  Here we have a CIA guy who's been in the country 20 years and feels it would be in the country's best interest to instill what was left of the Iraqi militia in the new govt.  There is logic in his reasoning as we witness a chaotic and war-torn Iraq in constant background.  Then we have a solder (Damon) running around from site to site on a mission to find WMD and not finding any.  A tip from a local guy who later becomes his personal translator leads him to the whereabouts of the head of the Iraqi army.  When the soldier (Damon) comes up with a little black book listing the whereabouts of that former Iraqi general, he is faced with a decision about whom to give it to - the CIA guy or his own chain of command.  As he seems to be getting the run around from his own command on these bogus WMD sites, he decides to hand it over to the CIA guy.  Working with him Damon goes about looking to find and bring back the general.  We feel Damon's frustration with not being able to find WMD and also his suspicion in whether or not there ever were any.  Background being what it is we can also sympathize with his siding with the CIA guy.  What gives this movie it's counterperspective though is Damon's Iraqi translator.  HE doesn't want to see this general put into the new govt.  When that stance is revealed, we suddenly question Damon's original and seemingly sensable quest - the Iraqi translator hates the general.    It's an interesting movie that makes you wonder about truth and fiction regarding the war.  Not that the movie is the first thing that ever made anybody wonder about that.  It's going to get under some people's skin because it takes true subject matter and mixes it with a fictious story - but again it'll have you wondering just how much of it is fiction.  For example, I'd like to know if there was any truth in the so-called \\"Jordan talks\\" where according to the movie, the general told them there were no WMD but then it was reported back to Washington that according to same general - there were.  In the beginning of the movie the soldiers are being led on their wild goose chase for WMD by instructions supposedly having been left by the general.  Later we find out from the general himself that those things were never said.  This being one of the special reasons Damon's chain of command wants him dead.  Again, there are a lot of tidbits like this that help form the basis of the movie and whether or not these events have been culled from fact or fancy, you don't know.  You know some of it's true, because they certainly didn't find WMD with that as justification for invasion basically and you know that troops are still there now.  So, how much of this movie is fact and fiction will play with your mind a little. If it is a propaganda film, then it is a clever propaganda film.  Either way though, it did entertain this reviewer.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is a huge Miley Cyrus fan.  She has been so since the beginning honestly.  Now do this, I have heard most of her music in the past along with this her latest work.  I must admit I really do enjoy how she covered Every Rose Has Its Thorn.  It sounds as good if not better then the original by Poison.  I strong feel that this album shows the vast musical talent that Miley Cyrus possesses.  I also have to admit, I honestly rather enjoyed listening to her music myself for a change.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|The year is 1766, and Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is born amid the filth of a Paris slum with an unusually well-developed sense of smell.  He grows up in an orphanage, never knowing a kind word or deed, perceiving and relating to his harsh life only through smell.  When as a teen, he sees a beautiful young woman for the first time, he becomes obsessed with capturing her essence in a perfume, but to do this, he must kill her.  She is but the first of many young women who will be used to create a scent of perfect beauty, innocence, and even love.<br /><br />In the beginning, the ugliness and brutality of slum life were so realistic I often had to look away.  In contrast, the second half is set in a beautiful countryside amid luxurious surroundings.  The photography and set designs are excellent as are the period costumes.  Whishaw gives an intense performance as the asocial, amoral anti-hero, an unlikable but fascinating character.  Dustin Hoffman is miscast as an Italian perfume maker.  His American accent and deadpan delivery are laughable and out of place.  Alan Rickman is very good in the small role of a nobleman.<br /><br />The story of a serial killer's desire to capture unattainable essences is engrossing, with final scenes involving 750 naked extras that are quite bizarre.  It's an  unpleasant but curiously intriguing story. 3.5 stars.

B003K025V4|4.0|Miley Cyrus's recently-released CD, 'Can't Be Tamed', contains many first-rate pop songs. The album's opening track, 'Liberty Walk', sets the album's electro-pop vibe, and its lyrics, such as 'don't like what you do/don't take the abuse', seem harsher than those of Cyrus's earlier works. This goes hand-in-hand with the more adult image that Cyrus is attempting to cultivate.    Other songs, such as 'Who Owns My Heart', 'Scars', 'Two More Lonely People', 'Permanent December', and to a lesser extent, 'Robot' and 'Can't Be Tamed', follow suit, delivering exceptional pop melodies. The passable lyrics, ironically are more relevent to teens than the adults that Cyrus is catering to on 'Can't Be Tamed'. I am currently sixteen years old, and upon initially listening to the album, I found the lyrics of most of the songs to be almost autobiographical. If Miley were still aiming her music at teens as on 'Breakout', this would be excellent, but she is not doing so. As a result, her lyrics come off as awkward in places when combined with her revamped image.    Additionally, 'Can't Be Tamed' is also unfortunately hampered by factors other than its lyrics. The more slowly-paced songs 'Stay' and 'Take Me Along' are extremely hit-or-miss; the former is a decent song, but would be much better suited to a singer other than Cyrus. 'Stay' was clearly slapped on as obligatory pop ballads to showcase Miley's range. To a lesser extent, this is also true of 'Take Me Along', and 'Every Rose Has Its Thorn'.    Stylistically, Cyrus's 'Can't Be Tamed' also fails to stand out against other electro-pop albums released since mid-2009. Granted, Cyrus's music sounds different to me compared to Lady GaGa's or Ke$ha's, but to many other, likely older, ears, 'Can't Be Tamed' would be lost in a sea of highly similar albums. Perhaps if the producers decided to go for a more acoustic sound for example, the album would come off as more sincere and less mass-marketed.    But that being said, I am a sucker for mass-marketed teen pop, so Cyrus's latest effort is very good in my eyes. But for many others, especially the adults that are supposedly targered by the album, 'Can't Be Tamed' would quite easily fail to deliver.

It's quite obviously a young reader book but makes for some decent light reading for adults as well.  It's one of those kind of books that you can read a bit at the airport, put it down...pick it up again in your hotel, etc.  You don't have to think much, just let the story drag you in.  I will definitely be checking out the rest of the series as there is a bit of a cliff hanger (naturally) at the end.  If you want to introduce your children to this fantasy/sci-fi type of reading, you could do a lot worse than this book.  Also, I see it's now on Kindle which I also recommend.

This 3rd edition is highly recommended.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|You will not recognize the actors, or so little. Even the cameo of Schwarzenegger is computer-generated. The film does not bring much new data. It seems to be mixing time periods, but it does not matter. The machine world has been experimenting a new generation of robots, partly human (brain and heart, etc) and partly machine to infiltrate the resistance. They are capturing human beings now to create that new army of infiltrators. Logical but not revolutionary, my dear Watson, or is it Sherlock Holmes, I was going to say Shakespeare. Then the resistance has been able to devise a signal that can freeze the machines that are always controlled by come kind of wave. Interesting but only experimented at local level.<br /><br />The new thing though is that the only existing hybrid retains enough humanity to be a machine for the machines, and recognizable as such by them, but with a real loyalty to humans to the point of helping John Connor come into the headquarters of Skynet, the network that controls all the machines, liberate the prisoners there, have a final fight with the impersonation of Schwarzenegger, escape with Kyle Reeves, a key to the future and destroy the place, which is a \\"given back\\" for a \\"given gift\\" because the military headquarters of the resistance had been destroyed because they tried to send a general air strike on Skynet in San Francisco, a move which was successfully opposed by John Connor and thus did not happen, but the signal these generals had sent to all units had had the effect of being detected by Skynet who had sent their taskforce to clear the place in one big airstrike.<br /><br />This episode, that will have to have a sequel since the salvation is not finished yet and has not reached liberation, ends with the hybrid being, Marcus Wright, giving his human heart to John Connor to save him before John Connors dies of his wounds. That human touch, quite in the style of Jesus giving his life to save humanity is going soft on our emotions and that's its main objective. A few tears please. But all together the story has not advanced a lot, except to prepare an eventual next episode that could be at least the first step towards liberation. But frankly the main danger of humanity today is not machines and an eventual take over from them, which would explain the relative flop of this film. It is more the take over the financial tycoons and traders of Wall Street had been able to perform leading the world nearly to the bottom of the abyss, at least to the brink of it.<br /><br />When I see the anti-machine or anti-technology stand of some in our society particularly among educators, I am amazed. This very week a university professor in education is advising us to take into account as the basis of our reflection the children who only have school at their disposal to acquire school-knowledge. I would like that very acute young man to tell me today what school-knowledge is in the knowledge economy and society, and to point out to me the child (a wolf child I guess, since so far wolves don't have TVs and smart phones) who would have had access to no other source of knowledge than school.<br /><br />These fake social-climbing-and-politically-minded-though-not-politically-correct-except-with-Trotskyites intellectuals were those who refused to use the radio in class, and then who considered television as the killing challenger of school, and now consider that all communication tools have to be banned from schools and universities, first of all smart phones. Yes there are some in our universities who think smart phones are nothing but a means of cheating.<br /><br />This ideology is behind the Terminator series, but it is today very pass&eacute;, very pre-historical, if history started with the GUIs (Graphical Users Interfaces). A highly considered communication expert I read in some paper lately considers that the technological revolution of our time started in the early 1990s. What an ignoramus. I would have swornthe Internet was first successfully tested between Stanford and Oakland, California, in the fall 1969, and that the first GUI was invented by Apple for its first McIntosh, and then by Microsoft with Windows 3.1, both at the beginning of the 1980s.

0307592839|5.0|This is an amazingly rich, well constructed novel that is at times sly, more than once hilarious, but overreachingly sympathetic and wise.  Employing the music industry for her background, Egan manages to mine fresh material out of a subject that has been excavated to death before but through her inventive handling becomes fresh and new.  Her themes of fame, its consequences and the passage of time only become apparent the deeper the reader goes.  She has great fun with structure by employing a variety of styles, and the reader has great fun too.  Although there are rapid shifts in time and place, backward, forward, far forward -- thanks to her crystaline prose and razor sharp characterizations, Egan never disorients the reader.  Some characters' histories take the entire book to complete, and some are told in deft brush strokes over the passage of a mere paragraph (most notably, that of an African \\"warrior\\" and his descendants encountered during a tourist safari). One of the more evocative chapters utilizes Powerpoint, which only heightens the material. Egan's strengths as a writer are developing with each outing, but this will be hard to surmount the next time around.
B001FB5634|5.0|The novel behind the film is absolutely breathtaking. The film tries hard to be as good and it neglects the literary means of the book to concentrate on the visual means of the film. We are just after the end of the world due to some kind of big fire that burnt everything down, covered the whole world with a shroud of ashes, killed all natural life whatsoever or nearly and locked up the whole earth in an immense cloud of ashes that caused at once the cooling down of the temperature and then the cold. We are not even given any explanation. We are shown the results and they talk all by themselves. The situation is simple as for the few survivors. The main two characters are a father and a son. A flashback later on will speak of the delivery of the child, quite a few years before, and the mother's going out to die in the dark after the catastrophe as she was for some vague reason dying. That's not the most important element. What we are studying is the behavior of the father and the son as long as they are together, that is to say all along, and how this privileged relationship makes them different from the other survivors. Some get together in bands or gangs and they raid the world to get what they can and survive collectively no matter how, that is to say even with hunting other survivors and cannibalism. Then you have those who are more solitary, alone or in couples. We have a few examples of solitary ones who become scavengers, but of the living, hence thieves, looters, killers in a way or another. The contact with these solitary people pushes the father towards some defensive and even over-defensive attitudes. The son intervenes then to counterbalance this over-use of protectiveness and to maybe remind the father of the human duty of sharing. A difficult task. But the film wants to take that boy to the end of the road, to the death of the father, to his mourning and sadness, and at the same time the desire to survive, like the father had said, and that desire will turn the father into a recollection, a memory and let the son accept to be integrated in another wider family structure, still on the road. The visual character of this film seems to tell us even in the direst straits of a final catastrophe, there remains some hope in the mind of human beings and they can first imagine their survival and hence try to survive and second keep some humane principles that are of course the promise of a humane society later on. That's the question that should be asked: is the survival instinct collective or individual, is the survival instinct capable to follow some ethical line? The answer is not easy since the film, like the book, do not go beyond the mourning the boy is confronted to at the end of his road and at the beginning of a second road. This road will maybe never end but all along the way some spirituality will try to survive. That's a very optimistic film, at this ethical level, though I seem to remember the book was optimistic too but at the level of the ingenuity and the inventiveness of human beings in some situations when survival becomes an obligation. At the end of this film there is little knowledge about the future but yet a gleam of hope.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDturn the father into a recollection, a memory and let the son accept to be integrated in another wider family structure, still on the road.

0553573403|5.0|This is truly one of the most gripping reads I've ever experienced.  When it comes to the fantasy genre, I can take it or leave it.  But I'd heard so much about this series that I finally had to give it a shot -- and believe me, it DOES live up to every bit of the hype.  835 pages flew by in just a few days.  This is the kind of book you forgo sleep to keep reading.<br /><br />The book's primary strengths are Martin's characters.  He is such a great writer that he can make you care about a character within just a few pages.  This book presents us with Ned Stark, a Lord who frequently places honor above wisdom, and most of the chapters are written from the POV of his wife and four of his children.  Through their eyes, we are introduced to an entire continent teeming with a rich history that binds the major players together in ways we only begin to comprehend.<br /><br />Martin does not hold his characters so sacred that they are protected from harm.  The people we start to care about the most are injured, captured and killed without ceremony or fanfare.  Even the prologue is a \\"Psycho\\"-esque feint.  Just as the story lulls you into that enjoyable complacency that comes of watching people have an adventure, Martin jars you back to \\"reality\\" with yet another twist that you did not see coming.  That, along with all the rape, cursing, extreme violence and extreme even more rape sets this far apart from any ordinary fantasy series.<br /><br />The map at the beginning and the appendix of characters at the end are indispensable to help orient you in Martin's world.  And once you're in it, you can't bear to leave it.  When the book ends, all you want to do is find out what happens next.  Luckily, I live just two blocks from a mega bookstore, so the wait wasn't long at all!  :-)

0553381695|4.0|This second book in George RR Martin's beyond-epic series is by turns frustrating and highly rewarding.  Like the first book, the story is divided amongst the third-person POV of several major characters, most of them Starks of Winterfell.  But unlike the first book, this time the structure detracted from my enjoyment of the story.  I was so eager to find out what would happen next in one storyline that I couldn't stop myself from skipping forward several times in order to see what happened next.  The characters propelled me along so effectively that I was more than halfway through the book before I realized how little was truly happening.  Characters are developed, but in terms of major PLOT developments, most of what happens to these people can be summed up in one or two sentences.  The Daenerys story is particularly disappointing after her stunning final scene in the first book.  She does get another great final scene here, but everything leading up to it is straight-up BORING.<br /><br />I will say this for Martin -- it's very realistic fantasy.  The story is not just non-stop action.  But the problem is that when there ARE good action scenes, we usually hear about them second-hand, or from the POV of someone who isn't directly involved, and witnesses it from afar.  Martin's strange decision to omit Robb Stark as a POV character means that we are not truly present for any of his spectacular battles.  I guess Martin wanted to save his juice for the massive naval and land battle at the end.  It IS an epic scene, totally unlike any I've ever read before, but a few earlier battle sequences wouldn't have given me any battle fatigue.  He writes them so lucidly that they simply whet the appetite for more.<br /><br />The main thing that did fatigue me is how tiresome the Starks became.  They always make horrible choices that lead to some calamity or fail to act when opportunity presents itself.  Time and again, it crossed my mind that maybe they aren't supposed to be the heroes of this story after all.  But it's Martin's world and there are no rules -- just tons of rape, tons of characters and (eventually) tons of action.  It's an excellent companion to [[ASIN:0553381687 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]], but does not stand as well on its own as the first book does.  At this point, it is abundantly clear that what you're reading is just one part of a gigantic story, and it becomes imperative to pick up the next volume immediately after putting this one down.  Martin's fond of his cliff hangers.  So I suggest that you have it handy.  Then take a deep breath, and plunge in.  As long as you hang in there for the slower sections, the ending is well worth the wait.story after all.

B001L0ZMJM|4.0|After Atlas Shrugged, one who reads The Fountainhead may be a bit confused as to the message.  I didn't really feel like I knew exactly where this was heading because it seemed the author did everything she could to keep it from the reader.  Instead, it comes off as a slow burn and spends a great deal of time in descriptive stanzas familiarizing the main characters and their motives.      Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Guy Francon, Gail Wynand, Ellsworth Toohey and even Peter Keating all come off as larger than life as though each one of them has a significant amount of influence over their subjects while each poses as a characteristic of human existance that most of us can identify with or know someone that does.      The main themes are individualism and integrity through Howard Roark but it's a very subtle and quiet integrity not to be recognized at all by his antagonists while devoid of grandiosity and pretense.     Dominique Francon is the most complex of them, coming off as a woman who doesn't care to hurt people but doesn't care to cater to them either.  She's willing to go along with society's whims but she does so with a quiet scorn and an inner strength of contempt.    Her father Guy Francon, owns the most prestigious architectural firm in New York with his last desire be that he is remembered and hopes to accomplish that while turning his hard work over to a man, far below him in ability, by the name of Peter Keating.    Peter Keating, Howard's architectural nemesis, is what most of us recognize as a leach, finding that it's far easier to prosper when following the direction of others and living off their accomplishments while knowing that he doesn't have a creative cell in his body.    Gail Wynand hates humanity and will try anything and everything to break it down but he has no problem ruling it if he can.  He runs the newspapers and wire services throughout the US.    Finally, Ellsworth Toohey, nothing more than a slimy little worm slithering throughthe Big Apple's core.  A worthless and vicious symbol of totalitarianism that wreaks of a hypocrisy so craftily formed that one cannot recognize him for what he is.  His is the domain of the so-called \\"intellectual givers\\" where those who do not buy into his brand of collectivism under his command are branded as selfish and self-centered when there is no person on Earth more selfish then himself.    This is the backdrop of a story about a man, who decides early on that he cannot be touched by any of these jackals and decides that all that is important to him is his work.  Because his priority is the work, that of creation, Howard Roarke is not influenced by money, fame, or reputation.  A man so willing to submit himself to hard labor rather than to sell himself out to the highest bidder and have his work bastardized by them.    This story does have gaps that are hard to understand.  The characters are so abrupt in some of the decisions they make that at times it seems almost contrived.  It stands out as the biggest criticism that I have of the work.  Secondly, some of the visual imagery sometimes just does not work well as though one should ask, did that add to the story and the answer being \\"not really\\".      Nevertheless, the methods that Rand uses to mold and form her characters is brilliant.  She does not come out and tell us exactly what we're experiencing but rather chooses to daisy pick certain instances out of the character's lives to demonstrate what this person is really all about.  Some are quite benign and some aren't but at the end of it, one knows who these characters are and with most of them, the reader will want to find out more about them.    At the end of the read though, one must feel a sense of triumph and hope for humanity for those who choose to believe in their abilities, especially those who choose to build rather than break down.  That good does triumph over evil but sometimes only in symbolic ways and that the majority of men and women are quite content living in hypocrisy as long as it's comfortable.

9889979942|5.0|This is an amazing book. I have never seen other works by this author before but it really captured my attention. I don't know how to explain it, but, its one of the most genuine books I have ever reviwed. The pictures are so real you can feel them. I really think the reason for this book to be so good is the way pictures are presented. These are real people not actors, these are real places  not hollywood creation, and the author has actually backpacked through different reigons of China. That to me is genious and at the same time great. Now without traveling to china i can say i have been there. It was just after reading this book that i decided to visit China. We are going in a year and i'm sure it will be a lot of fun.  Hope to see more from the author in future.. May be middle east or india? good luck with your book.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Not one for hyperbole, and hard to please, quite frankly. I feel like I've seen it all. But Beyond the Lighted Stage truly is one of the best rock films (the best?) AND documentaries I've ever seen. I've now watched it twice and I liked it BETTER the second time!    We live in a mixed up, tortuous world. But a beautiful world too - where good people can get together to do great things. And - do it their way. What a great story. Neil Peart's Dad's comments about the day he joined Rush - man, if that doesn't get you fired up and warm your heart, nothing will.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I am contemplating my review. I really don't know where to begin except to say this movie is a work of art. Christopher Nolan is the artist and Inception is his masterpiece. I really don't see where he can go from here.    I won't go into detail about the plot because it will give to much away. Essentially a man named Dom Cobb(Leonardo DiCaprio) takes one last job to plant a idea inside Robert Fischer Jr's(Cillian Murphy) mind. So he can be able to go back to the United States and be with his children. I won't tell you why he can't go back it's a big part of the plot. The story is a dark tale about dreams and reality. None of these characters are good guys after all they break into peoples minds. Still you end up liking these flawed characters and root for them. That sometimes the dream becomes our reality and you can't tell the difference. That sometimes we prefer our dreams to the real world. The ending will leave you questioning what happened and what was real and what was the dream. If you don't pay attention this movie can be hard to follow. At one point near the climax there are four different plots going at the same time.    The cast and acting was superb. Besides Leo who we should all know. There's Cillian Murphy(28 days Later/Sunshine), Ken Watanabe(The Last Samurai/Batman Begins), Joseph Gordon-Levitt(3rd Rock From The Sun/The Lookout), Ellen Page(Juno/Whip It), and Tom Hardy(Layer Cake/Bronson) round out the staring cast. All of which do a great job. Though I think Watanabe, Gordon-Levitt, and Hardy were the best. Rounding out the supporting cast were Marion Cortillard(Public Enemies) and such veterans as Tom Berenger(Platoon/Sniper), Pete Postlethwaite(The Usual Suspects/Alien 3), and Michael Caine(The Quiet American/The Dark Knight). The Michael Caine only had about three minutes of work in this film if that. Tom Berenger did a wonderful job with what he had to work with.    With this complex story that is hard to follow some people might think thereisn't any action or suspense. They would be wrong. From the opening scene the suspense builds until the stunning climax that I think will leave you speechless.    Then there's the music by Hans Zimmer(Backdraft/Crimson Tide/The Dark Knight). Virtually every score he composes for a film ends up being a great.    Finally there is the the directing by Christopher Nolan. A directer who has far as I know hasn't made a bad film yet. Hell he hasn't made a average film yet. All his films are good if not great and he just keeps on getting better. From Memento to Insomnia to Batman Begins and The Prestige to finally The Dark Knight. As if he was honing his craft for this film. The film he's been working on for years. Like I said his masterpiece. He is without the doubt the best director of this past decade and it looks like he will be in this decade. Is he one of the best directors of all time. With the likes of Eastwood, Spielberg, or Kurosawa. No he's not but he's well on his way.    Overall for me this is the best movie of the summer. The best movie I've seen since The Dark Knight and one of the best Films I've ever seen. This is how films should be made with great writing, amazing acting and music and wonderful directing. It's hard to find in Hollywood now a days with endless sequels, remakes, and unimaginative or original stories. It's not the first to delve into this territory. Films like Dark City and The Matix(Before the ruined it with the crappy sequels) all went in this direction but only Nolan brought it to reality. If there is truly one movie to see this summer Inception is it. I am going to see it multiple times.

1423101472|4.0|I thought this was an extremely satisfying ending to the series.  Everything is neatly tied up and explained.  The events are the most part fast paced.  I did get a little bored during some of the in between battle times while they were defending NYC.  But, then Kronos would attack again with some new monster and the action would pick back up.  I loved Hestia's role in this book.  It felt like a much needed recognition for the lesser known Gods.  I thought it also played in nicely to the inclusion of Pandora's box and that all that was left was hope.  I was happy to see the relationship between Percy and Annabeth finally progress.  It was once of those it's about time moments.  I loved Rachel's finally place in the story.  It just made sense to me, especially since I never felt the connection between Percy and her.  It always felt forced.<br />Overall, just a wonderful book and great tie up.  I'm looking forward to the author's next series involving the Egyptian Gods.  I don't know as much about them, so I'm interested to see if holds the same pull as this one did.
030745455X|5.0|The second book in Larsson's Millennium trilogy continues the adventures of Blomkvist and Salander, following threads that began in the first book.  A few thoughts about the book:<br /><br />  * I've read much (and agree with the ambivalence other people express) about how Larsson's book shows and revels in a lot of the violence against women which he dislikes.  This was a bigger problem in Dragon Tattoo than in the second book.  Don't get me wrong, there are some disturbing and brutal scenes, but nothing to the level of the scenes in book 1.<br />  * I suppose it's necessary for the story and perhaps I'm a bit naive, but MAN this book has a lot of men who secretly hate women.  Okay, it's the villains mostly, but the number of people in this story who walk around thinking viciously misogynist things was pretty depressing.<br />  * The villains who emerge as the story goes on are pretty great, especially Roger.<br />  * I thought this book does a better job balancing the central mystery and the exposition.  One of the complaints I heard from others as they read Dragon Tattoo was about the financial stuff at the beginning.  This book gave us more about Lisbeth and Mikael (Lisbeth especially), but was able to do so because the central mystery is about her instead of about some extra person.<br />  * This book goes full speed right up to the end.  I've heard that Kicked the Hornets Nest starts right where this book ends, and I can totally see it.<br /><br />Oh, and there's actually a point where you \\"get\\" the title to this book.  A nice change.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|The 1975 UFO-abduction of Travis Walton near Snowflafe Arizona is probably the most convincing such case on record. It was multiply witnessed; Travis (the abductee) was missing for five days and nights to be returned traumatised and dehydrated; extensive investigation including polygraph testing of all the witnesses only strengthened the reality of the case, and not one of the witnesses has changed a single detail of his testimony after 35 years. Anomalies in tree growth compatible with high radiation exposure have been identified in subsequent years in the precise location where the encounter with the UFO reportedly took place, so despite being outside our normal paradigms of consensus reality, it looks like it really happened.<br /><br />Tracy Torme's 1993 film is a thoughtful piece of work which conveys the essential elements of the story and is largely faithful to the real-life narrative. D. B. Sweeney as Travis and Robert Patrick as Mike Rogers are particularly outstanding in an excellent cast. All the cast and crew became convinced by the story during the shoot. A town in Oregon substituted for Snowflake in the film.<br /><br />The film begins on the morning of 5 November 1975, a normal day for the young loggers engaged in their tree-thinning contract. The encounter takes place as the seven loggers make their journey home down a mountain road in Mike Rogers' pick-up truck in the early evening, shown from the perspective of the six witnesses as Travis is knocked off his feet by a beam from the hovering UFO. The subsequent difficulties experienced by members of the crew during the five days Travis was missing is well realised, as they deal with accusations and incredulity from the wider community and suspicion from the local police authorities. Then Travis is returned, confused and traumatised, the story attracts the international media and things get even worse for all involved. The film has a good script, dramatic tension, is convincingly acted, well edited and rewards occasional repeat viewings.<br /><br />In his literary and informative book of the same name, Travis describes the making of the film and his involvement with it. He explains the reasons why the abduction scene aboard the UFO and the appearance of the aliens in the film differ from his real-life recollection; why these changes were made to enhance the drama and to communicate the horror and strangeness to the audience. He also felt D.B. Sweeney was well cast, shared his attitude to life and had a similar general character, and was pleased with his portrayal in the film. I really recommend reading the book to anyone interested in the story. Travis is a good writer and discusses many things including his own life prior to the abduction and some of the far-reaching philosophical implications of non-human extraterrestrial life, particularly as it seems to be visiting us here.<br /><br />I met Travis in Snowflake AZ in May 2010 and found him to be as genuine, straightforward and principled as everyone who meets him describes him to be. He wishes he'd stayed in the truck with the others, and would have preferred had the incident happened to somebody else. The international exposure has been so unwelcome that for years he didn't even have a phone and shunned virtually all media contact. He and Dana (who have been happily married all these years) have four children and eight grandchildren, and almost never discuss the incident within the family or with neighbors. They still live in Snowflake, as quiet a middle-American town as you could imagine, where on a weekday everything seems to close at 9pm. He is a man of few words but those he does speak are well-chosen. He radiates integrity and has a terrific dry sense of humor.<br /><br />It's a pity Torme's film generated only US$20 million in 15 years, but nevertheless it was a modest commercial success. It's good, has stood the test of time well, and deserves a bigger audience.casional repeat viewings.

He is the recipe for overcomming vogueish Malthusian 'end of the world' 'expert' views (ie. static vs dynamic).  A terrific read - especially comments regarding evolutionary links to free trade, Botswanna and global warming.  Great historical examples of both wealth creation/destruction. I submit to his \\"Name a Phoenician emperor\\" taunt!
B0000062FL|5.0|In its heyday, this was the album nobody could (or should) be without. 1970 was the year for this masterful piece of classic rock history. I at one time had this on an LP but it got lost. I made up for it when the CD came out (as a Nice Price series for Columbia), so the loss was covered. After the group's first knockout recording, this immediately followed in the footsteps, not losing a beat anywhere. I play my bass with this album on such numbers like \\"Singing Winds, Crying Beasts\\" to Tito Puente's \\"Oye Como Va\\", interpreted by the band's percussionist Chepito Areas as well as 8 time Grammy Winner Carlos Santana on his trademark guitar. I played my bass to the first 5 tunes, until I reach \\"Samba Pa' Ti\\", and what bassist would not want to play along? Santana finally got the lost (blatantly) respect he deserved for \\"Shaman\\", but to me, his earlier Columbia efforts were worth my praise. This one was such an example.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|The two sided disks contain the same formatted DVD and Blu-ray software as the one sided disks. And while they may or may not scratch easier?, that has nothing to do with their compatability in the Blu-ray players. The reason you get the problems with freezing, pausing, skipping and so on, is the Blu-ray players are not able to handle the disks software, and while updating firmware in players can prevent some of this, it will not always solve ALL compatability issues. Case in point - AVATAR Blu-ray. Almost 50% of the Blu-ray players out in circulation could not play the Avatar Blu-ray disk. And even with firmware upgrades, many still could not play it properly without menus popping up or staying on screen, skipping, pausing and so on. One of the players that had the biggest problem with playing Avatar - Samsung. Samsung initially took more calls and complaints than any other manufacturer, and I'm not sure if they ever got the problem solved. I'm not bashing Samsung, both of my higher end Blu-ray players, the Marantz and the Pioneer couldn't play Avatar either, while my Magnavox (first generation) Blu-ray player played Avatar perfectly, with no problems, and no firmware upgrade. The point is, the Bourne flip-disks are fine, if you have the right player. (Probably Sony(not sure about PS3), Vizio, Panasonic, Magnavox/Insignia/Sylvania, just guessing). By the way, I loved the Bourne movies (all three) with Matt Damon. Damon brings his unique blend of strength and sincerity to the part of Jason Bourne, and he delivered fresh and passionate performances in each film.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|Oh oh oh...it was TERRIBLE!! I absolutely love Lil Wayne as a rapper, but this crossover was horrible. Wayne definitely has the wrong voice for rock.

Try to use it to ease the pain of Lil Wayne's train wreck of an album.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|As someone who has ALWAYS been interested in Royalty, (ALL Royalty, but especially English Royalty), and in costuming, (ELEGANT costuming, only, that is -- from Ancient Egypt to the present day), I obviously found this movie, \\"THE YOUNG VICTORIA\\", (especially with all of its attendant great publicity -- and Oscar-Winning costume design!), totally irresistable!  Not having seen it in a movie theatre, I just had to take a chance and buy it here on Amazon.      And I am SO glad I did!    I had known, before-hand, that Princess, (later Queen) Victoria of England, (here so wonderfully played, with feeling, shading, and depth, by EMILY BLUNT), had had problems with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, (played with equal believablity by the late NATASHA RICHARDSON) -- but had not heretofore known the depths of them.  Over-protected almost to a cocooning and smothering degree by her mother, (who makes it mandatory that Princess Victoria be accompanied every time she walks up and down the stairs, and forbids her daughter the reading of novels until the age of 17), and, even more evilly, by Sir John Conroy, (MARK STRONG -- in an equally deftly-shaded and believable performance).  In fact, EVERYONE acting in this movie -- from Ms. Blunt to STEPHEN RALPHS -- uncredited as Prince Albert's archery coach -- was totally and wonderfully believable in their roles).  Sir John has concocted a  scheme wherein Princess Victoria should sign away her rights to the throne -- because she is \\"too young and inexperienced\\", and that her mother, (with Sir John as the real power-behind-the-throne), should act as Regent, at least until the Princess reaches the age of 25 (!)  At the beginning of the film, Princess Victoria shows her spunk by totally REFUSING to sign a paper attesting to this, although she is quite ill and physically weakened.      Later, when Victoria is better, a birthday ball is held for her uncle, William IV, (here, just listed as \\"King William\\", and played with three-dimensional bravado by JIM BROADBENT).  I have, in my own reading, discovered that King William IV is said to have declared he wished to be able to live just long enough so that his neice, then 17, would be able to inherit the throne at age 18, and that no regency, (of her mother and John Conroy), should take place.  I do not know whether this sentiment was actually given as vehemently as it is presented in the Birthday Ball scene, but I do know that this WAS what William IV wanted!    Victoria becomes Queen in due course,  She is escorted downstairs, (for what is to be the last time), by her mother, to hear the news of her uncle's death from two courtiers who have come to tell her this.  A very, very famous painting, of Victoria, young and sweet and in a long-sleeved white nightgown, receiving the homage of these two gentlemen, is, in this movie, beautifully -- if all too fleetingly -- reproduced and broght to life in the movie.  She is now her OWN mystress, and climbs up the stairs to her room, ALONE, for the first time in her life.  Her mother and Sir John are banished to their own, separate apartments within Buckingham Palace -- and Sir John is NOT permitted to attend the Coronation.    Attending the Coronation, (which, like most Coronations, probably went on for several hours, in reality, but is here, in this film, of sad necessity, collapsed into but a minute -- or less), is the young Prince Albert of Saxe-Colberg-Gotha, (played, so well -- with all the depth, intelligence and hauteur any viewer / royalophile could expect -- by RUPERT FRIEND).  He has been helping and encouraging Princess Victoria a lot, through the film to this point.  She feels happy, protected, and appreciated in his company....and it's not long before she, (as is proper in Royal circles), proposes marriage to him, and he gladly accepts!    Wise Queen Adelaide, (HARRIET WALKER), the consort and wideow of William IV, gives the young Queen Regnant much good advice.  This includes the sending-away of Baroness Lezen, (JEANETTE HAIN), who had been Princess Victoria's council and friend during her childhood, a refuge from the stern, selfish regime of Princess Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent.  In many ways, it was Barnoness Lezen made Princess Victoria's life at all bearable -- but, as a married woman, Queen Victoria had to let her go, as the position of Victoria's comforter and protector was now rightly that of Prince Albert.  And Prince Albert, only....     Prince Albert notices that the fires in Buckingham Palace's fireplaces are never lit, and that the windows are SO dirty that he can hardly see out of them.  And that dinner is set out, in a separate room, every night, for, (of all people!), King George III -- who has been dead for twenty years!  He sets about organizing, and modernizing palace procedures -- and, presumably, also eliminating the nightly dinners held for King George III!    Victoria and Albert, it is interesting to note, (at least at the start of her reign, as herein depicted), were LIBERALLY-MINDED, and cared very much for the conditions under which the poorest of their subjects lived.  However, the Conservative Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, (wonderfully played, with many levels of feeling, by PAUL BETTANY), though truly protective, and admiring of the Queen, and encouraging her to use her OWN power and decisions, against those who would STILL rule in her stead), still does NOT have these positive feelings towards \\"ordinary\\" people.  It's the old \\"Robin Hood\\" concept again -- only this time, it is the earstwhile \\"Robin Hood\\", (and the here-even-more-powerful, earstwhile \\"Maid Marion\\"), who are, in fact, the Queen of England her Prince Consort, who care, truly and deeply, about the welfare of their \\"ordinary\\" subjects -- and the conservative Prime Minister, (still, however, a commoner himself), who belittles the importance of non-royal, non-aristocratic people!    The costumes in this movie, (designed by SANDY POWELL), are appropriate, (as inthe black mourning costumes worn after the passing of William IV), beautiful, breath-taking, but not overly so. Lavish, yes -- overly-ostentatious, no.  Historical accuracy is what was aimed for here, and costume designer SANDY POWELL more than deserved her Oscar.    It is too bad that this movie ends with the birth of Queen Victoria's first child -- of nine.  She and Prince Albert reigned together for a total of twenty years -- during which, I hazard to guess, the companionship of her beloved Albert kept Victoria young feeling and young-looking, in spite of growing slightly older, as it also, contemporaniously, also added to wisdom beyond her years, Happiness can do a great many things -- and I hoped to see them even more played out in this movie, which I expected to end with Albert's death, or, at the very least, the birth of their last child.  The length of this film, I suppose, did not allow for all these things to be played out -- but mention of all of them, (plus the myriad Royal Houses that the descendants of Queen Victoria so admirably filled) - is at least given, briefly, in sentence-form, at the very end of the film.  Mention is also made of the cause of Albert's death -- typhoid fever -- and his age at his death.  Only 42!  :_(    The DVD has extras of deleted scenes, a conversation with producer SARAH FERGUSON, (yes -- THAT Sarah Ferguson!), a section on \\"The Real Victoria\\", interviewing actress Emily Blunt discussing her reading of Victoria's diaries and letters, and many more extras.      For me, it is the spunkiness and assertiveness of Princess Victoria -- then, of Queen Victoria -- which truly stand out. In fact, the \\"nice surprise\\" in this movie, (for me, anyway), is that, along with being historical, engrossing, and beautifully-done by all conerned, it is also a gentle, yet definite lesson in assertiveness-training!  Even being a Princess can have its perils, as this movie explains all too well.  There are those who would rule in Victoria's steadin this movie -- just as there are people who, (and instituions, which) would, for most people, tell us how to think, and act, and feel.  Living by the rule, \\"My freedom to swing my arm ends, where your nose begins\\", is often harder to impress on other people, (and institutions), than it is to be believed by one's self.  Queen Victoria could so easily have become but a footnote in history, and remembered only as \\"Princess Victoria\\"), had she not decided to use her own mind and her own will.  She had advisors, of course -- but in the end, it was HER decisions that counted.  (A contemporary of Queen Victoria, Abraham Lincoln, once put it this way.  His advisors gathered with him, and an idea was put to a vote.  All the advisors voted \\"Yea\\", but Lincoln voted \\"Nay\\".  After the voting, Lincoln said: \\"The 'Nays' have it!\\")  Being one's OWN person is perhaps one of the most important things in life.  Many women who consider themselves \\"ladies\\", however, are often shy and non-assertive -- evne when they WANT to be assertive.  Such women, (like me!), are often drawn to romantic, costume dramas.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone -- but especially to romantic, non-assertive women who wish to become no less romantic, but also more assertive.      One of Queen Victoria's royal duties -- that of presenting an exemplary image, to which others, in their own perhaps less-grand, (but still crucially-important, to themselves and to those in their own smaller spheres), can stive to emulate -- remains intact, and, with the aid of this movie, and of the sterling performances within -- continues, (alongside the equally-sterling examples of modern-day Royalty), to this very day, and to years and years beyond it, as well!    Long live the glorious memory of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert!  And long may this film, dedicated to bringing their lives and memories, stay in print, to charm, entertain, and educate, many, many more generations of people, the world round!
B003KT3NRA|4.0|I would have given this album a five star rating but I am disappointed that the album is mostly cover songs.  When I heard Vince was releasing a new album last year I was excited to hear what he was going to do outside of Motley.  I am a fan of both his other solo releases so I was hoping there would be a full length solo album and not a mostly cover tune album.  I do like his cover versions of all the songs on this album and love the title track but would have liked mostly original material.  Guess I will need to wait for the next Motley album to get that.  I still say this album is worth a listen if you like Vince and want a different spin on some classic tunes.  Love the cover of Aerosmith Nobady's Fault especially.
0307454541|3.0|I think this book had great potential to be really intriguing.  Unfortunately, the first 400 pages are mind-numbingly dull.  A couple interesting things happen, huge plot twist at the end and then it's over.  Ugh.  I'm giving Stieg Larsson the benefit of the doubt to say much is lost in translation.  Then again, maybe the Swedish are more into (seemingly) unrelated detail than I am.  It was pretty painful for me to read. (I'm one of those people who HAS to read a book all the way through.)  I'm not sorry I read it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I like.<br /><br />The story, once we got to the interesting part, was pretty good.  I think the movie will be great.
0307474712|4.0|It's the perfect conceit -- checking in annually with two young adults who may or may not be \\"meant for each other.\\"  Don't we all have a story like this in our past (or wish we did or wonder if we could or might)?  The sexual tension builds, of course, and it does feel at times a bit like a TV sitcom or drama in which the entire season is built around whether or not so-and-so will finally get together with so-and-so.  But I'm a sucker for those TV shows and I was a complete sucker for this book.  Dexter, male lead, appears to be a bit of a caricature at first, which is in fact what he discovers about himself, and Emma will cause you to physically flinch with her foot-in-mouth disease.  The characters are charming in their flaws and foibles, and you care about what happens to them.  In fact, you may find yourself talking to them before book's end.  For such a cleverly funny book full of laugh-out-loud moments and statements, it is also startlingly sad.
B000006SGT|5.0|The complete title is kind of deceiving because this just mainly covers their 1964 and 1965 songs and many of these songs are just covers of older blues and R&B 50s songs. It still has a lot of their hits and shows the Animals for the music geniuses that they were. I read on a music critic review that the Animal's covers of the older blues songs were average at best and not as good as other groups covers in the 60s, but when I was listening to this, I knew the Animals sounded so professional and a few songs even sounded better than the original recordings. The Animals used a lot of organ, which was one of the most influential instruments in their band, and they could really jam out with the blues and rock n roll they covered. Of course, their top hits like Boom Boom, House of the Rising Sun, and Don't let me be Misunderstood are all classics that only add to the wonder of this collection. I didn't think I would get into the Animals that much, but after hearing all their blues songs and covers, I knew they were one of the best bands of the 60s.

B000002BFZ|4.0|You know, I really like Pearl Jam.  I like Eddie Vedder, and he and the rest of the bunch seem like a group of really good guys.  Guys you'd like to have a few beers with.  Guys with their heads on realtively straight and their hearts in the right place.  Not to mention they seem like a bunch that really knows how to blow the roof off the place when they want to - and they seem to want to quite often.<br /><br />As a result, I own several PJ discs and had heard enough about \\"No Code\\" to figure it was finally time to add it to my collection.  Luckily, I found a used copy - in excellent shape - while searching the amazon marketplace.<br /><br />\\"No Code\\", however, seems to me like Pearl Jam trying to be Sonic Youth or Peter Gabriel or Brian Eno or David Byrne or some combination of the above.  They have every right as artists to step out on those limbs, but I'm still not sure what I think of the results.  I'm pretty sure of one thing, though:  When I want to hear Pearl Jam, it's likely the \\"Ten\\" re-issue or their second album, \\"Vs.\\", that I'm likely to grab.  It's not that I don't like artists branching out or taking risks, it's just that with this particular release, I'm not sure about the quality of the finished product.<br /><br />I hate to be so non-committal and I know it's doubtful that many will find this review helpful.  I can't help thinking, however, that my response to \\"No Code\\" - as nebulous as it may be - might just be the response Pearl Jam was shooting for.  Notoriously known for bucking the system - and it's preconceptions & expectations - PJ may have dropped \\"No Code\\" as a reminder to us all just who's in charge.  Just the kind of thing a bunch of good guys might do . . .
B001OQCV6K|1.0|This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. If I could find one good point I would mention it, but there are none. Check that, the actors do try hard to save this disaster, but they just couldn't fight the lousy script.
0312370849|5.0|I read this book after a friend recommended and it was well worth reading.  I couldn't put it down and was nearly brought to tears. I was able to connect emotionally with the characters which allowed the portrayal of the Holocaust to be especially moving.  The author maintained an excellent balance of fact and fiction.  There was enough historical content that I felt like I was learning something, but not so much that it got in the way of the narrative. The jumps in time from present day to WWII era were also easy to follow. A fantastic read!

B00140PK6O|5.0|Feeling sorry for myself after multiple lung problems requiring me to take load of meds and time off from work (but NOT in the fun way), my darling Brit husband and I watched this wonderful BBC series featuring one of my favorite actresses, Judi Dench.  Anything Dame Judi touches is pure gold in my Anglophile eyes and this was no exception.<br /><br />A period British costume 5 part BBC series told in one hour increments, each one topped the other.  Beautifully acted, staged and set, kudos must go to Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Lisa Dillon and Imeda Staunton along with Simon Woods, John Bowe and Francecsa Annis that make this quaint 19th century British village come to life.<br /><br />Manners matter.  Visitors may call upon you after 3 o'clock but not a moment before.  The introduction of a new, young village doctor gets the ladies bosom's heaving, imaginations going into overdrive with misunderstandings making it only more delightful.<br /><br />It is not acted in broad strokes but in small intricate ones that compose the moral compass of the entire village afraid of change whether involving a new neighbor or the imposing railroad linking them to Manchester.<br /><br />I know its the middle of the summer, but I am putting this on my Christmas list.  My husband is going out to pick up its sequel.  He enjoyed it as much as I did.<br /><br />My husband and this DVD are both British keepers.<br /><br />Enjoy the show but keep your hands off my husband!

B000N4SHOE|5.0|Growing up in the middle an Illinois cornfield I was more a \\"Chicken Little\\" and \\"My Friend Flicka\\" type of kid.  It wasn't until as an adult and moved to the big city of Peoria that I was introduced to the delightful Beatrix Potter.<br /><br />In this DVD, \\"Miss Potter\\", her life is fictionalized to fit the big screen's time allottment and format thereby taking creative license with much of her true biography.  Purism aside, it is a beautiful, lush and imaginative film filled with gorgeous period costumes, manners, morales, and scenery.  Her country home in the Lake District is so visually stunning it makes watching this film worth it, even if you were to dislike the rest of the movie.  Rene Zellweger and Ewan MacGregor fill out their roles beautifully as does the supporting cast especially Emily Watson as MacGregor's sister and Barbara Flynn and Bill Patterson as Beatrix's parents.<br /><br />Although rated \\"PG\\" I would not have a problem watching it with younger children and Seniors as I found nothing in poor taste.  The fact that it is a movie the whole family can gather round and enjoy is worth a star on its own merit.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie!

After living in China for 4 years, I'm tired of trying to dispel stereotypes of China that persist in the West every time I go home for a holiday -- now I can just give my family and friends a copy of this book and show them that, no, actually all Chinese people don't look alike. Carter's pictures are brutally honest -- they show the best and worst of China without any lens but the truth marring the picture. His anecdotes are also a great peephole into the Middle Kingdom, from a foreigner's perspective. Don't know how he got half these pictures, but I am sure glad he did.
1603425381|4.0|The pros: Colorful, creative borders (including corners and stitch counts!) - complete with written instructions and charts. There are a lot of options, from simple to complex, from chunky to lacy, which offers a large amount of good options for all your projects. They instruct you how to add these borders to knit/crochet projects, and even fabric and felt!<br /><br />The cons: The physical book is oddly shaped, and isn't spiral bound like Beyond the Square. The book won't lay flat, keeps closing on me, and is difficult in that manner.<br /><br />Sum up - good patterns, bad physical book.

B00095NX9G|5.0|This is one of the best tribal belly dance dvd's I've ever tried and I've tried them all.  It is well organized to help the viewer to develop a practice schedule.  As a tribal belly dance instructor I've been able to use adapt of the drills and moves into my regular class along with my usual curriculum.  Some of the material may be a bit challenging to a beginning student, but if one continues the use the dvd, she should be able to learn the material.   This is a great dvd to add to anyone's collection.
B003LAH7MU|4.0|Hello all, I was so taken with the detail and beautifully written review by Brian that I had to post a review of my own, despite the fact that I have no right to review it because I produced this record with Sting. This music has meant so much to me, these songs, this artist, that the daunting task of arranging a lot of the current tour and producing this record haunted me for months. This review will contain some defensive comments but I hope they at least illuminate the process of making this record for anyone who cares. It will also hopefully serve as a slightly better indication of why (Brian's question) the record was made and the thinking behind a lot of it. First of all, for those who think that Sting is slacking off and just trying to continually recycle existing material, be aware of this. The record was something that happened almost by accident and the whole venture was essentially another voyage of discovery for Sting, who loves Orchestral music.     The story: He was invited by both The Philadelphia Orchestra and The Chicago Symphony Orchestra to put on a concert of his music arranged for orchestra. A tour was planned based on the appeal of those concerts. They were a thrill for him. In his words, \\"what a joy and honor it is to hear songs I often wrote on a guitar alone in a room played by a group of peerless musicians\\". All that said, the concerts highlighted the difficulties of a venture like this. Many music stars do Standards records and other similarly minded projects to appeal to adults who attend Symphonic concerts and higher brow Arts events but still love great Pop music. These projects are occasionally successful but they can be artistically dreadful. Is there anything worse than a series of ballads peppered with cloying Strings?? This was exactly what Sting did not want to do and in fact his earliest direction to the arrangers was to \\"please not give the orchestra endlessly held chords that are beautiful but are better for putting people to sleep than entertaining them\\".     \\"Write with adventure and invention\\", he said. (If you listen carefully to my arrangement of \\"Roxanne\\" or Dave Hartley's arrangement of \\"I Hung My Head\\", you hear intertwining melodic lines in the orchestra and not just lush chords.)     Because of Sting's directive, the first arrangements were therefore extremely intricate and involved but occasionally covered up the charm of the songs. I was brought in to write orchestrations that were more mindful of the original records while not imitating them. I knew two things. Number one, there was no way in hell one could compete with such magnificent records. Number two, I knew some longtime Sting and Police fans would be perturbed by any kind of orchestration at all written over songs that were originally played by three magnificent players. It was almost like starting with a minus sign on your forehead. The Police were a band that was all about space.     How could I not take on the challenge, however, of writing arrangements of songs this strong??? Too often, arrangers in the music business are invited to write orchestrations on Adult Contemporary projects, most typically big ballads and one does not often get to work on muscular and deep music like Sting's body of work. I wrote a number of arrangements and one of the things I wanted to figure out was a way to approach some of the harder and more intense material. I wanted to write vital and active orchestrations to offset the tracks that would inevitably be what people expect on a record like this; rich and ruminative slower material, something an orchestra does so well. In the spirit of those early records I found what I thought was a way in. I went to see my friend David Cossin, this remarkable percussionist from Manhattan, play with the group Bang On A Can All Stars. The concert was amazing, arrangements of Brian Eno's \\"Music for Airports\\" and other post modern pieces. I thought via the use of odd found percussion instruments and intense, hard and joyous String writing we could actually play some of this material. I initially recorded the \\"Next To You\\" arrangement for Sting to hear and he loved it. He was most excited about the fact that this meant we could approach things like \\"She's Too Good For Me\\" and even the earlier Punk inflected songs and create a concert that was really a challenge for the orchestra. \\"Next To You\\", within Sting's camp and with musicians in the New York area, got such a positive reaction that it served as a real kick in the pants and got us going. Sting started getting deeply involved in the direction of the arrangements and enjoyed that process, knowing instinctively when the arranger was heading down a rabbit hole.    He did not intend to just make another record of his songs but he really was moved and galvanized by the experience of hearing the songs in a new way. The concerts have gotten terrific reviews and while rehearsing in London we decided to record some of the material at Abbey Road Studios, where the rehearsals took place. The recordings I had done in the late winter came out so well also that we realized there could possibly be a full record here when added to the Abbey Road stuff. I kept experimenting in New York and discovered \\"End Of The Game\\" and \\"Pirate's Bride\\". I told Sting I could not believe these beautiful songs were virtually unknown, \\"Pirate's Bride\\" in particular being one of his most beautiful ballads. He gave me license to try things including his idea of evoking a classic British Colliery Brass Band for the remarkable \\"We Work The Black Seam\\", one of my favorites on the project. The one thing even the naysayers would have to admit is that we avoided some terrible sand traps:     1. The record is not all ballads. \\"Next To You\\", \\"She's Too Good\\" and \\"End Of The Game\\", among others, feature demanding orchestral writing and yet take the originals and don't distort them beyond recognition.     2. The ballads all have a concept behind them--\\"Roxanne\\" came from Sting's suggestion of the original obsessive Bossa Nova groove, the one he used on All This Time, the concert DVD recorded on 9/11, \\"My Ain' True Love\\", arranged magnificently by Steven Mercurio, is haunted and not cloying in the least, evoking a Civil War battlefield beautifully, and \\"Pirate's Bride\\" features haunted Oboe and Jo Lawry's incandescent voice. One of the strongest songs from the tour ballad wise, \\"Why Should I Cry For You\\" makes use of the gorgeous Island Of Souls melody, the melodic germ that propels the whole Soul Cages record. It is available elsewhere as a bonus cut.    3. The arrangements do not go off on a million tangents nor do they drown the songs in either syrup (in my opinion) or a million endless interludes, which is often the case with projects like this.    The main reason I wrote this review is to put to rest the idea that Sting is idle and only recycling. He is writing music for a new project right now and he has just wanted to spend the last few years on input, as he says, and not output. He is constantly learning and endlessly curious. He has had such a moving and wonderful time hearing the songs fleshed out for great instrumentalists and he has had a chance to work with some wonderful orchestral writers; Vince Mendoza, Jorge Calandrelli, Dave Hartley, William Ross, Robert Sadin and the magnificent Italian composer Nicola Tescari, who arranged one of the highlights of the current tour, a fully contemporary and almost Alban Berg-worthy take on \\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\".    I am sad that \\"Next To You\\" and \\"She's Too Good\\" seem to be needless to one of the reviewers below. They are just about joy and keeping the project alive and exciting. The opening of \\"She's Too Good\\" was written with the same kind of spirit that I get when listening to the last movement of Stravinsky's Violin Concerto. None of the arrangers, including myself, have any patience for pastiche though, trying to sound like this composer or that composer.Absolutely not. Rather; we were all energized by the remarkable chance to work on arrangements for one of the most gifted and wonderful songwriters of the last 30 years. I hope Brian will give the disc a second and third listen and I hope some of you who are disappointed by the orchestration on these at least understand where this album came from. It would take my entire life to answer every bad review. It is probably silly to even write this but I love talking about concepts and music and I found most of these reviews smart, engaged, and written with care. Sting is great to watch when dealing with harsh criticism. I paraphrase: The Arts are all about exploration, he would say. Self doubt and criticism can creep in and make you question trying different things. Avoid it at all costs.    He loves singing \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Every Little Thing\\", which I arranged as a tribute to the Latin underpinnings behind the original recording (we have actually done a new mix of it with all new percussion called the \\"Bronx Street Fair Mix\\" which is incredibly rhythmic and pumping and it should be available on the upcoming vinyl release). He loves singing \\"Englishman...\\" and \\"Next To You\\" and recognizes the gift he has received: the reality that so many people want to hear him sing these iconic songs. He just wants to keep it interesting. I admire him for it and working on this project was a privilege.    Above all listen to that voice. Just extraordinary! I hope you check it out. It came from the heart. Thanks Brian for getting me thinking. Music, music, music, music!!!!!    Rob Mathes
B0039UTDFG|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Until I read these reviews I didn't even know that Attenborough first narrated Life, and I can certainly see where his expertise would make him perfect for this. But to be honest, having just watched this series, I found Oprah to be quite tertiary to the entire experience. I focused easily on the splendid cinematography and symphonic score and barely noticed the narration, and when I did it was never as horrific as many here make it out to be. Why all the hating? Put on yours stereo instead!<br /><br />So let's focus on what's great about Life, which is almost everything: phenomenally gorgeous images from around the globe, above and below water, of so many different life forms, doing their mating dances and other wacky rituals that make one realize how very similar all creatures on our big blue ball really are, homo sap included (though most of these critters aren't stupid enough to foul their own habitat over and over until they have to move elsewhere; wish I could say the same for one species I know). The slow-mo shots are especially sweet, the water frozen in the air in endless states as its gift--life--flows on all around.<br /><br />The pictures do all the talking here, and narration is mostly an afterthought and hardly integral to understanding and glorying in what one sees. If Oprah is so tough on your ears, simply turn off the volume and put on some Debussy or Beethoven or Sibelius and enjoy the many synchronicities bound to occur between sound and sight.<br /><br />This has some pretty raw moments of animal-on-animal \\"violence\\", but I'd still heartily recommend this for families and schools, if perhaps not the youngest of kiddos. But there's not a gun to be found, just natural life doing what it does, so do your kids a favor and show them these fine films in lieu of yet another Hollywood ad for gunpower. In fact, Oprah might be more up your kids' alley than Attenborough, so turn that supposed negative into a positive!<br /><br />And whatever you do, don't let the many nay-sayers here dissuade you from seeing this extraordinary panorama of life, in supremely crisp blu-ray quality. I'd watch it again with Attenborough in a second, which is to say, it's worth watching with any narrator, even Rocky and Bullwinkle.tever you do, don't let the many nay-sayers here dissuade you from seeing this extraordinary panorama of life, in supremely crisp blu-ray quality.

B002ZG980U|3.0|I went into this movie expecting more than it delivered.  It is not a horrible film, and director Nolan certainly deserves much credit for the inventive, creative and artistic elements.  However, my problem with the movie boils down to not enough special effects and too many scenes where the characters are standing around talking, not doing anything.  At over 2 & 1/2 hours long, there ARE several SFX scenes within Inception, but not nearly as many as the trailer leads you to believe (the street cafe and crumbling-cliff-skyscraper scenes previewed in the trailer are the two main ones), and in between SFX are long passages of talking.  The blurb description of \\"Bond meets The Matrix\\" has some relevance, as this film has several things in common with those two series.  For example, the \\"snow fortress\\" scene has seemingly endless shots of guys on snowmobiles shooting machines guns, a la Bond, and one of the \\"Dream Team\\" morphs into another character a la The Matrix.  (Just two examples of many similarities I could list.)  However, I didn't enjoy Inception nearly as much as either The Matrix movies at their best, or the best Bond flicks.  The strongest section of Inception was the final 15 minutes or so, where the multiple layers of dreams have to pull together for the good guys to survive, but even THAT was interrupted by a too-long, talky parting scene between the DiCaprio character and his wife, where they seem to be just repeating the same lines for about 10 minutes!  I once read a critic's guideline that you could tell how good a movie is by how many times you checked your watch.  The fewer times, the better.  (No watch-checking at all means a really engrossing move.)  I must have checked my watch at least a dozen times during Inception.  I also saw a few people get up and walk out of the movie, not returning.  I predict this flick will have some negative word of mouth from people like me expecting a big summer sci-fi movie but getting a drawn-out head trip instead.ad.
0743496736|2.0|How do I describe this story? Long and tedious.  Few if any surprises.  Reads like a fake biography in parts.  Kind of a second tier soap opera, nothing new or deep to ponder.<br /><br />I know some will find this harsh, especially seeing the ratings of others, but what a disappointment.  This was my first Jodi Picoult novel.  No thanks to a repeat.  She's not without talent, but there was little here for me.

B002JVWR4A|5.0|This has been my favorite show from day one. I love every season of it. I wasn't even bothered when zach left, I really was never that big of a fan of the charactor. I always thought he was boring, and when he came back in three I thought the charactor didn't serve the purpose that he'd served in the first two seasons. but i think the show has actually gotten better without him. bringing cam on was a brilliant choice in two and I love Sweets. although even though I love every season I will say that so far the last three seasons have been dynamite..(I can't pick just one,Lol) but five was just amazing. the 100th episode proved to the best acted, best written episode of the series. and they remembered history. and although I'm a fan of booth and bones as a coupling. I'm not an obsessed fan that gets upset or threatens not to watch if they do something that I don't understand. Like everyone complained about the finale of four. but the finale of four had a really great outcome in five. just like people are complaining on other boards about the finale of five. I loved it. I loved everything about it. mostly, I loved it because it's so romantic. and you know their going to come back together, closer than ever. even if they come back with opposite others. it's going to bring them together. but anyway, I really enjoyed five. maybe in six everybody is going to see her fighting for him for a change. afterall, in season five he'd fought for her all season long. I think that would be an appropriate change of events. Booth, coming back with a new girl, bones, jealous. her fighting for him to see her and take her like he'd wanted all along. that's what real romance novels and movies are made of. whether it lasts a long time or not. and you know, if it was fast or predictable when things would happen, the show wouldn't be so addicting.
1401300529|4.0|After over two years on my night table, I was finally motivated to read the book by the 60th anniversary of the start of the war.  In spite of the title, the focus of the book is on the Chinese counterattack in November of 1950: why they intervened, why we failed to foresee their intervention, and how we adapted our strategy and tactics to their tactics.  Although there is some good material on the war prior to the Chinese entry, there is almost nothing on the last two years of the war after the lines stabilized in March of 1951.  Perhaps because there are other books on the Marines' fight out of the Chinese trap around the Chosin Reservoir (Martin Russ' \\"Breakout\\" for example) there is almost nothing on that heroic march.  Generals MacArthur, Almond and Willoughby are the villains of the piece, while Ridgway and O.P. Smith (commander of the First Marine Division) are Halberstram's heroes.  On the home front, Halberstram who was haunted by his experiences in Viet Nam, emphasizes the political consequences which lead to our involvement Viet Nam.  The book seemed a little scattershot to me although I found it illuminating.
B000002H6Q|4.0|There is no doubt that `Dr. Feelgood' is Motley Crue's most accomplished and successful album and for good reason. The band made the lifestyle changes (albeit temporarily) that allowed them to produce music that their collective talents were capable of but had been held back by living certain aspects of the rock n' roll lifestyle to the hilt (ie. drugs, drugs and more drugs). Nikki Sixx sobered up (to save his life never mind his career) and wrote a much better album as a result. The pulled off the rare combination of sobriety without losing any of their edge and result (no doubt helped by new producer Bob Rock) was also their best sounding record as well. The hits flowed through as the title track, \\"Kickstart My Heart\\" and \\"Don't Go Away Mad\\" showed that the Motley's weren't going away, at least not for awhile. Some of the additions which had influenced the previous album, sort of a glam blues thing flourished on `Feelgood'.  Sex dominates such pornographic but fun ditties as \\"Slice of Your Pie\\", \\"Sticky Sweet\\" and \\"She Goes Down\\" while the Crue also shows their sensitive sides with a couple of ballads.  Unfortunately the highly combustible nature of the four personalities would mean that success would not insure stability and within a couple of years the first of several band blow ups would occur as Vince would leave for the first time. Motley are still here today but they said all they needed to say with Dr. Feelgood.

B001FB5634|5.0|I liked the book and I have to say the movie was just as good.  It's not the kind of movie you think you will like, but it ends of leaving you with a good feeling after all the devastation.
0060558121|5.0|My cousin insisted that I read this book. Every time she was in town, this was brought up again and my opinion was asked. Now, I'm not very good at getting around to reading books on recommendation. I'm even worse about getting to said books when they're described to me in such an unattractive manner. However, I am easily annoyed and that gets things done much faster. So, one day, I picked this up at a bookstore and I haven't put it down since.<br /><br />That was several years ago and I've read it several times now. I love books that require my entire focus as I read, and this one just happens to fall into that category.<br /><br />Even though she advertised in a really weird way, I have to say that I am incredibly glad I was introduced to this book and I wish there were more like it.<br /><br />Obviously, a book isn't for everyone, but I'd recommend this anyway. A lot of the story is tied into subtle details and mythology, which is wonderful. As a writer, I definitely appreciate the effort put in to create the perfect feeling behind a scene and the characterization is brilliant. I must also point out the strange realism in this book, considering the nature of it and say that I adore this.<br /><br />American Gods is lovely.
B00110K62U|5.0|I was in London in July 2010 and thought I must go do something a bit more intellectual. I thought that instead of all the waste of time and money on the shopping districts, I should go watch a classic play such as Les Miserables. It was a very wise decision because this play is truly a piece of art.     First of all its a musical play. Not a musical like \\"Chicago\\" where the songs can't be heard for long, but something close to the quality of the music of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" where you would go buy the soundtrack afterwards. The songs and music were breath taking.     The story is also wonderful and sad too. The American guy sitting next to me was in tears since the play started. There were also moments for me when I was too close to having a few tears, but I am not the kind of guy that cries at movies or plays.     Great Play. Worth every pound paid.

B0031ZWZR2|5.0|FlashForward is a very interesting show with a very innovative concept. It is a shame that ABC cancelled it as a result of low ratings, which were an unforseen result of improper scheduling.  Its not too late for ABC to bring it back for a second life, like Fox did with Family Guy. In the meantime, you can catch up with this show by watching the DVDs and getting to know the wonderful characters and world of FlashForward. Recommend it to your friends too. Your support will show how much we want the show back!
0399156577|5.0|I've been reading Nora since the early 90s.  This is one of my top 10 favorites of her books.  The heroine's romantic interest is different than her usual men and he takes a little getting use to, but he's hot, no doubt about it.  The heroine is strong, yet shows human vulnerability (especially considering what she's been through).  And, this took me by surprise since I'm not really a dog lover,  I loved the descriptions regarding the dogs personalities and the education on dog training as well as the search and rescue portions.  This was a really enjoyable read.

0440243688|4.0|Jack Reacher returns in this solid thriller that pits Reacher'ss military skills against a teams of soldiers in a shadowy war.  A woman commits suicide on a New York subway and her death leads Reacher to a former Delta Force operative now running for senate and two women who may or may not be terrorists but who weave a tale worthy of Scheherezad-ie.  Reacher uses both muscle and guile to solve the mystery.
0061906220|5.0|This book is an absolute hit with kids of all ages, from kids to adults!   We read it so frequently that I purchased extra back up copies just in case one gets ripped.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|\\"Capitalism\\" is interesting, but no longer as thought-provoking as his previous works.  In some sense, \\"Capitalism\\" shows Michael Moore's allegiance to a country he loves.  Generally, Moore (and his work) is one you will either love or hate... there is no middle ground.  This movie is not his best work, but it is still stirring and somewhat informative.  Some might say it is one-sided, and others will agree.  The examples presented are extreme and engaging, but maybe it is what we need to motivate ourselves to do what we can to get out of the hole we are in right now.  Capitalism works, and it works for the many, but capitalism works well only for the few.  I probably will not recommend this movie as a \\"must-see.\\"  But it can be entertaining if you have an open mind.
B000001F6N|5.0|The short version is I love the variety, beautiful songs, powerful songs, and dynamic songs.  There are so many great gems.  It is a masterpiece and a must have for John Mayall and/or Peter Green fans.    Okay, I noticed there is/are different remastered version/versions floating around. I can not speak to Michael Halls review in 2006.  Though I bought my copy rather recently in 2009, my CD is a 1987 copy of the original 1967 album 20 years earlier.  Also my version says \\"London\\" yet at the same time \\"Made in the USA\\".      My bias is musically I am primarily a harmonica player (though I play guitar and piano) and have become a huge John Mayall fan in the last year or so.  For a while I wasn't a huge blues fan BUT John Mayall reintroduced me to the blues with his albums that grew on me and renewed my interest in not just his albums but the blues in general as I feel I hear things I did not before as well as other influences at work in many blues songs.    Though there are some great blues songs on this album, it goes far beyond the just the blues though I love the originals and blues covers.  Peter Green sings while John plays one of my favorite blues songs while John plays harmonica on \\"You Don't Love\\" probably best known by the \\"Allman Brothers\\" but written by someone else. This version sounds great as well and now I can follow John playing harmonica on one of my favorite blues songs.  This album is dynamic and shows a range of musicianship, song writing, and genres of music.  Peter Green's  \\"The Super-Natural\\" sounds like like Carlos Santana.  I wonder if Santana was influenced by Peter Green or thought of Peter when making his \\"Supernatural\\" album about 22 years later, (1999 I think).  This is not to take anything away from Carlos Santana but to understand Peter Green's remarkable performance.

B00005JNNZ|4.0|Gotta love a great \\"stand up and cheer\\" movie--a feel-good flick that puts pride in your heart and a lump in your throat.  Such a creature is COACH CARTER, based on the true story of one Ken Carter, who returns to his alma mater--a California urban school--to take over the basketball team, but more importantly, to emphasize the word \\"student\\" in the phrase \\"student athlete.\\"  Winning games is wonderful, according to Coach Carter--but winning in the classroom is even more wonderful.  Thus he drafts a contract for his players--and their parents--whereby they agree to make more than the required 2.00 GPA, plus faithfully go to class.  When some of his charges fail to live up to the document, Coach Carter locks his team out of the gym.  Now he's got the entire community's attention--not to mention the country--yet Carter perseveres and his bacon is ultimately saved--from a negative school board and outraged parents--by his own players.  Once the student athletes excel in the classroom they enjoy even more success on the court, leading to some terrific hoops sequences.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson gives a stellar performance in the title roll.  He's tough, demanding, sometimes harsh and shrill, yet he's also fair and compassionate, given a particular circumstance.  His players are totally believable as basketball hoopsters, led by the always-sturdy Rob Brown, who was such a debut sensation in the remarkable film [[ASIN:B00005ASOC Finding Forrester]].  COACH CARTER looks good, feels good, and is good; less than 5 stars due to way too many tired cliches.  Overall this movie is nothing but net.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Mark Knopfler is a rare talent , and that is combined with genuine humility and so much soul. He seems to think profoundly as is evidenced in his lyrics and I look forward to each of his new releases , or old ones that I have yet to discover.

B0001WTVUW|4.0|I remember seeing this film the first time it was on TV and I think it could have been a great In Theater Movie. It certainly had a great cast of stars in it and that's another reason why it could have done much better then just being a made 4 TV movie. The special effects where wonderful too. Unless the director was just too cheap to make it an In theater picture, so he simply made it for TV.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|The release of this documentary got me all excited about being a Rush fan again. I had stepped back from their music from a number of years, and had not purchased any new releases since Roll The Bones, which I hated. Then I saw that a new documentary was soon to hit DVD. I began scouring youtube for details and samples, and it got me all fired up about Rush again. I pulled out the entire catalog of albums (that I owned) and reminded myself how good this band are.     For me, I'm a huge fan of Rush from 1980-1989. Permanent Waves through to Presto were all great albums, though some are obviously better than others. As far as their earlier work goes, I do own and enjoy Hemispheres. Though I've purchased A Farewell to Kings twice, one of those times being in the last month, I just cannot get into this early sound of Rush. While Geddy Lee's voice is one of the highlights of their music for me, it was far too shrill in this early incarnation, and finally started becoming less painful and more enjoyable on Permanent Waves.     With my excitement for this upcoming DVD, I decided to pursue the later Rush albums that I chose to pass on since Roll The Bones. I purchased all of the studio albums, including Roll The Bones again. They are spotty for sure. RTB still stinks, and I can only find 2 songs worth repeated listenings. Counterparts was another bland effort with only 3 songs worth listening to. Things pick up on Test For Echo, in which I enjoy nearly half of it. Vapor Trails was a grand return, containing quite a few wonderful melodies and hooks, though with the well known terrible mixing and mastering. Snakes and Arrows had very few hooks or melodies, and only managed 2 great songs. So my future interest in Rush is in limbo.     I love documentaries, especially about music. 'Beyond the Lighted Stage' certainly did not disappoint. We get to see how the band grew up basically as misfits and outcasts, and have achieved an amazing success that has left them just outside of the mainstream, but also not a struggling cult band. The friendship between Lee and Lifeson is such a rare thing, and to truly enjoy each other to the level they obviously still do is a blessing. While details of their personalities can be hinted at by watching their concert videos, this documentary really shows the dynamic between the three very different members of this band. Geddy Lee is the more serious and melodic member of the band. Alex Lifeson is, as expected, the nutrageous comic relief and hard rocker of the band. Neil Peart is the more introverted, sensitive and humble member. All of these traits come together to form a very unique and respectable musical unit.     I wanted the documentary to go on forever, but the ample bonus material gives a little relief. There is a lot of focus on the early part of the band, yet some details are not really mentioned. I'm sure it's probably easy info to find online, but I felt the doc should have covered how the band chose their name, and what, if any, relationship they retained with their original drummer, and even some words around his passing.     There seems to be two sides along the Rush camp - those who love their 80's electronic influenced output, and those who do not care for it. For me, it was the 'New Wave' influence that attracted me to Rush. The first song I enjoyed by Rush was 'Vital Signs'. My sister had the Moving Pictures LP back in the day, which is how I heard this song. Let's face it all of you hard rock Rush fans, if 'Vital Signs' was released as a single by a brand new band in 1981, it would have been labeled as New Wave. And that's what I loved about Moving Pictures and subsequent albums. For the record, this author's music collection consists of New Wave and Classic Alternative, with Rush being the most 'mainstream' artist I own. And I was so pleased to see in this documentary the band proudly admitting their influence and acceptance of New Wave influence into their music. It's what attracted andretains me all of these years later. One can assume with the limited focus on Rush's 80's output in this documentary, the filmmakers are more fans of the Hard Rock style of the early albums.     For those of you who enjoy documentaries, feel a little like a social outcast, or like only 1 song by Rush, I would highly suggest purchasing 'Beyond the Lighted Stage'. Whether or not I like a particular song or album by this band, they are arguably the most talented musicians in rock music, and experiencing this streamlined version of their story was a delight. I've had Rush on heavy rotation for the past couple of months now.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Some spoilery ahead.....I don't understand why publishers have to release books in a series with 6 month to a year in between!  My rant for the day...anyway, I had to go back and skim the first book, Shiver, to remember what happened in that book.  I found myself crying through most of Linger.  It was heart wrenching. In summary, Grace and Sam have found each other again, her parents find the Sam has been sleeping with Grace, and staying in her room at night, and they are less than happy about that.  Meanwhile, Grace is becoming deathly ill, and Sam and his new housemate, Cole are trying to figure out why.  I really like the introduction of Cole, who is one of Becks new wolves he changed.  We get some backstory about him.  I am looking forward to seeing where things go for he and Isabel.  So a small spoiler, this book ends essentially the same way as the first one, only with a role reversal.  Now I have to wait another year for the final book!!!  uugghh!
B000002LN9|5.0|What a great CD.  Could not find it in Sydney so thanks you Amazon .  Contains songs played with 4 piece band, a blues band and an orchestra . Edge of Darkness good way to end.  Very good to hear live versions of Cream songs. Stuff like this makes one envious of not living in Northern hemisphere (London, NY) where great artists give concerts so regularly.  In Australia we have such a long wait between visits of guys like EC. Cannot recommend this CD enough.

B003HE2B6C|5.0|I'm not your typical Hanson fan.  However, as the mother of a typical Hanson fan, I've followed the talented brothers throughout their career.  \\"Shout It Out\\" shows the genius of these fine young musicians, from the toe-tapping, can't-stop-dancing rhythm of the majority of these songs, to their clever lyrics, to the added horn section, to the Hanson trademark three-part harmony.  I absolutely love this CD, and I highly recommend it to every pop music collector ... no matter how young or how old!

This book is humorous and fun. I totally recommend it.

0307269981|3.0|I agree with some of the reviewers that said there was a lot of unnecessary details in this book. There were a lot of things going on and I also agree that a lot of people had similar names - making it hard to keep track of who's who. Maybe they needed a \\"who's who\\" in the front so we could keep track of all the police, detectives, magazine/book publishing people etc... It did pick up at the end however getting there was a LONG haul.<br /><br />I guess it was OK. We learned a little more about the character...but I don't know - this conspiracy theory seems like a little much. I'll read the 3rd book to see how it ends.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|The title of my review reflects my anxiety after ordering this amplifier, and my relief upon using it since it arrived. At such a low price point, I was worried that the device would be cheaply assembled and not deliver on its basic functional potential. I'm glad to report that this amplifier does exactly what it promises: it boosts the output from a DAP a few dBs, with no noticeable distortion. I can't comment on how well it synergizes into other portable rigs, but I use it to drive a pair of ATH-FC700s from a Sansa Clip+. I couldn't be happier with the combination. This little amplifier accomplishes the most basic task of a headphone amplifier brilliantly: it takes a small part of the amplification load off of the player itself, which tends to apply a lot of distortion at higher volume levels. There is a bass boost switch that I tend to keep in the ON position--it evens out a slight discrepancy in my headphones. Unlike other, intensely exaggerated bass boost options, this amplifier's boost is subtle and doesn't seem to introduce any noticeable distortion.    The build quality is surprisingly good; the metal case is well-fitted to the (admittedly cheap-looking) plastic components and its metal clip feels very sturdy. The photographs of this device are very descriptive of its general build quality and appearance.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was very pleased with my copy of the BluRay version of Avatar. It will remain as a favorite in my collection.  However, James Cameron indicated that he'd include things in the DVD release that weren't here. He said he wanted to include a split screen with his actors reading the lines, then the final shots, to show that they were, in fact, \\"acting\\" and the digital processes included their performance. So, I expect another \\"Director's Copy\\" before Christmas. Look for it right here on Amazon.  MB
B0030Y11XS|4.0|This documentary is Mr. Moore's latest commentary on the American business community.  Made in the wake of the real estate bubble burst and the onset of the \\"Great Recession\\", this movie feels like a sequel to Mr. Moore's previous hit \\"Roger and Me\\".  This time, he focuses on Wall Street and the major US banks.  He zooms in on the TARP bailout, and highlights some of the abuses of the money.  There is also a great section on how corporations often buy life insurance on their employees, betting that these employees would then die.  The movie ends on a high note with a look at the Obama administration and on specific instances, it has went against big business.  My only beef with this movie is its lack of citations of major laws passed with regards to corporate regulation.

There are only 3 songs on the soundtrack that I only like while all the other ones are amazing, with my very favorites consisting of: To Glory, Moving Mountains (just love it when the voices get to the triplets towards the end), Heart of Courage, Black Blade, and Infinite Legends. You definitely owe it to yourself to get this CD, especially if you love epic music.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|TOY STORY 3 is the perfect bow completing the Toy Story package.  My mother, 13 year old daughter, 5 year old daughter and I all loved every minute of it.  TOY STORY 3 made all three generations of my family laugh, cry, and cheer.  Yes, the story is basically the same story told in the other two movies - the toys have to get back to Andy - but we certainly didn't care.  Disney has pulled off a perfect hat trick, a golden triple crown with the Toy Story trio, and they are all endearing family movies.  And it is possible that TOY STORY 3 is the best of them all.<br /><br />TOY STORY 3 is clearly meant to be the end of the Toy Story saga:  Andy is going off to college (really?  It seems that just yesterday he was 6 years old and getting a Buzz Lightyear doll...where does the time go???).  Andy must decide what to do with his favorite toys; he hasn't played with them in years, but they are still his favorites and have sentimental value.  What should he do with them?  Through an unfortunate but completely plausible mistake, the toys end up donated to a preschool.  Although most of the toys believe Andy sent them there on purpose, Woody is ever loyal, and knows that this is not the case.  He finally convinces the others of their error, and now, of course, the toys must get back to Andy before he leaves for college.  Will they ever get home?  Will they get there safely?  Will they make it before Andy leaves?  What will become of them?<br /><br />TOY STORY 3 is delightful entertainment for the entire family.  Disney does many things right, but their stories with the message of being true to yourself and true to your friends are always outstanding.  These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many forms.  And TOY STORY 3 is one of their best.<br /><br />With outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike will are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim.  The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect.  Added to that are some wonderful gags that will leave you laughing until you cry.  Look for guest appearances from many toys from your childhood; they will bring back many happy memories and lots of giggles.  Especially endearing was the return of Barbie, who at long last met her Ken.  Their interaction, as well as Barbie's stunning declaration that \\"Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force!\\" (she really has brains under all that blond hair!), is hysterical and memorable.<br /><br />Take lots of tissues to TOY STORY 3, especially if you have a child who has left for college.  Andy makes a beautiful decision in the end, and clearly, all the toys we have come to love will live happily ever after.  Well done, Disney.  The entire TOY STORY trilogy is a true classic, one that will be loved by generations to come.tory is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect.

0802473156|5.0|This is an excellent book.  I recommend it to any couple before they get married.  Even if you are already married, I recommend you read it.  It really helps each of you understand how you accept love.  I didn't understand that each person has a different love language and until you tap into what it is, you truly cannot become one.  After reading this book, I am confident that my marriage will be stronger than ever.

B002L3RVCY|4.0|Great addition to the Star Wars legacy.  I think animation greatly frees some aspects that were more difficult when you had live action, even with CGI.  Yes, some of the dialogue can be lame.  I agree with the individual that every writer should be fined, flogged or both every time they write, \\"I got a bad feeling about this\\" for ANY character.  It's uttered by a different character in almost every episode.    At times you feel the Jedi are really showing their strengths and why they were so powerful.  Other times, you kind of go, \\"huh?\\"  Case in point: in one episode Obi Wan is about to catch the bad guy.  He's right there.  The bad guy throws some capsules off a three-story high platform (or more) that will be disastrous if they hit the ground.  Does Obi Wan use The Force to suspend them in mid-air?  Nope.  Throws himself off the platform to catch them in his hands while falling to the ground himself.  While it certainly adds to the dramatic tension (the bad guy throws or threatens to throw these things repeatedly to thwart capture), it seems you could stay truer to Jedi capabilities and find dramatic tension another way.  There are a number of instances like that where they don't do things that would be very simple, while using The Force in very dramatic ways elsewhere.    One other surprise.  In one episode, a trooper exclaims, \\"What the h*ll?!\\"  What the h*ll, indeed.  While I could see the inclusion of such an exclamation in a director's cut, that kind of language has no place in the series. Now I'm hesitant about letting my 5 year-old watch the episodes.    Those are my caveats.  Other than that, the series is entertaining and forwards the whole storyline from the \\"missing years\\" between the live action episodes.  It would almost (ALMOST, I say) be a welcome addition to have one or two small interactions inserted into Episodes IV, V & VI where Vader encounters R2D2.  He's so close to the droid in this series, you could really put some subtle moments in whereone recognized the other and was torn about what to do.  But that's what comes from doing the last episodes before the first ones, I suppose.  Sure wish Lucas would follow through with the original intent of having Episodes VII, VIII and IX.  Love to see the original stars come back as their aged characters bringing along a new generation.  I think the reception of the most recent Star Trek movie and others show that there's a big market for building on the nostalgia from 30 years ago.
0525423842|1.0|I was looking forward to a great story by one of the best story tellers of our time.  There was minimal suspense and intrigue.  The ending left me wondering why I even bothered to pick the book up.  I wanted to read it first and then have my 12 year-old read it, but I fear that he will be bored to death.  The book was a basic law review for young children who likely know most of it already.  The story was boring and predictable.  I will give Mr. Grisham one more chance with the sequel.  I have read every book published by John Grisham, and this was not even close to the level of previous books.  Very disappointing!

B002HFP0QU|3.0|The two discs are ok.  I guess I was expecting more of the Saturday Night Fever music.  My fault, I should have checked it out further.
0743487486|5.0|This book challenges so much about what we're told or see as parents to do to our kids.  Get control, time out, smack, shout, manipulate, bribe, coerce etc.  Even things we don't realise we are doing have the potential to have a profoundly negative impact on our kids.  I just nodded the whole way through it.  Be warned though, it is not a quick fix solution and nor does it profess to be.  It is more about establishing a healthy, positive relationship with your children that doesn't centre around controlling them.  I really love it and have seen the results already just by making some subtle changes.  I wish it could be a law to make all parents read this book.
0470474874|5.0|I spent some time in the book store, and then in Microcenter, looking for a book on Excel.  Of course I then ordered it from Amazon to save a lot of money.  This book is the one you need.  It contains just about everything you will ever want to know, from beginner to advanced user.  This includes expecially Visual Basic for Applications for advanced users.      The best thing I have found about this book is that it each topic is short and concise.  There is no \\"fluff\\" in this book.  Every sentence has some meaning and the examples (also included on the CD) are straight forward and to the point.  There is no wasted space in this book.  You will find in \\"tips\\" some things that you won't find in other books, or in the Microsoft documentation.      If you are a beginner or advanced user, you will find this book a treasure of information.  It should be the first book you buy about Excel 2010.
B000Y9Q59W|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Wall Street\\" when it first came out 25-odd years ago.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the BD version, thinking it would look spectacular compared to the DVD copy - was I wrong! The transfer to BD looks herendous - in fact, it looks like you are watching a DVD copy of the movie, not some digital remastering at 1080p.<br /><br />Save your money - buy the DVD copy and enjoy.
0440242401|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! I blew through it in about a week and a half and had a hard time putting it down! I felt so sympathetic towards the main character, but I also fell in love with her. She is funny,sweet, and her private thoughts to herself throughout the novel often made me laugh out loud. Don't miss out on this read. It's too good :-)
B003LFLOOW|4.0|I think the special effects were great.  However i do not think you need 2:40 minutes to get your point across.  About an hour was wasted.  The plot was set when the avatars fell in love.  We did not need an extra hour battle scene to follow.  It became repetitious.  I gave it a 4 star, but maybe a 3 1/2 for the extra time thrown in is what it really needs. I'm sure there will be a follow up movie or TV series.  I just hope it doesn't end up stupid or boring.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I had all six seasons of Gilmore Girls and eagerly awaited the final season. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Amy Sherman-Palladino ending the show perfectly.

B002QQ8HAG|3.0|The September Issue is a superficial look into the making of the September 2007 issue of Vogue. Many of the shots consist of various photographers, art directors and members of the editorial staff behaving in a groveling and subservient way around editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. The one exception is stylist Grace Coddington, a confident and gifted woman who does superb creative work and isn't afraid to stand up for herself. Her work really is the backbone of the magazine. Once she leaves, Vogue is on a fast ride downhill. Wintour's insights, as she looks at and discusses potential fashion spreads, seem fairly prosaic. She must have gotten the job by game-playing and the usual machinations of the business world. Outside of standing back somewhat and letting Coddington do her work, I don't see what she contributes to the magazine except for making her staff feel compulsively insecure.<br />I enjoyed the few scenes that show her with her twenty-something daughter, who wants to be a lawyer. She clearly has the ability to \\"get\\" to Wintour that no one else in the film does. Good for her. Wintour talks about her father and siblings, but neglects to mention her American mother, an interesting omission. Wintour is a lonely character, in a way. There's a revealing scene of her in the back of a town car clutching a Starbucks coffee and staring straight ahead. She's off in her own world most of the time.<br /><br /> As is to be expected, no one on the Vogue staff actually wears the outlandish clothing featured in the magazine. Wintour wears flattering silk dresses, Coddington dresses in various frumpy black outfits and the staff and photographers wear practical work clothes. The exception is Leon Talley, the only member of the staff who truly buys into the fashion myth. Since Wintour reveals so little of herself and the filmmaker is as deferential to her as the rest of her intimidated staff, ultimately \\"The September Issue\\" is an elegantly made film with no emotional heart.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is the best movie so far it is just AWESOME They finally got Rosalie so right this movie and so many others just look fantastic.  I loved how Caspers and Rosalie storys were told.  I just love it, cant but will have to wait for Breaking Dawn lets hope there will be a movie marathon that night. One negative was I didnt like the new Victoria I thought she was just to i dont know too innocent nice looking, the original Victoria has a naughty girl edge to her I loved.
B001NHZ2KW|5.0|A great movie about the Who which has been expertly brought into the modern era of video/sound technology.
B003HKN52A|5.0|It's been a long time coming.  The greatest peformer of the 20th century has recently split with his wife, in a few months he'll play Madison Square Gardon (4 shows in 3 days, 2 on CD), he will perform for the world via satellite (the first to do so) in less than a year and in Cleveland he was described as a black studded tornado.  This is not Las Vegas.  While I love the Vegas shows, this is a whole different world.  City after city, no days off, sometimes 2 shows in a day.  The voice is more powerful than previous.  Sure, the filming was not that great and at times the audio was a little weak.  But where else can you find Elvis performng in 1972?  1972, regarded as the year Elvis peaked.  This is just a small glimpse of Elvis, but it's the only good one we have.  One can not watch and listen to \\"You gave me a mountain\\" or \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\" without realizing he was blessed with an abundance of raw talent, the kind we may never see again.  He knew what he was doing.  So ignore the film work and enjoy the greatest performer you will ever see.  The King of Rock and Roll.
0060007737|1.0|This book is more about Ries point of view than any \\"immutable\\" laws I'm aware of.  While well expressed these views seem to make an imbalanced and narrow assessment of how things work in the world.  The book minimized the value of advertising, and the role of design in branding so much that it's not very useful for someone who is actually in branding.  It may have more appropriately been called, an approach to doing business by someone who likes Coca Cola.  Someone who wants to develop a sales strategy for a global product line might read it... I just didn't find it practical, especially since it's rather dated now, and a lot of the claims have been proved wrong by events since 2003.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|The box set is beautiful and well designed. The plastic which grips the CD's on the interior is just beginning to peel off which is disappointing but otherwise the case is very high quality.  Panels fold out to reveal cool images of the cast.     The series itself is addicting and extremely well done. Always intensely violent and occasionally border-line pornographic, TRUE BLOOD is always pushing the comfort zone of its audience in its mad pursuit to reveal the darkness hidden under the seemingly idealistic small-town life of Bon Temps. TRUE BLOOD is not for the faint of heart. Those who are willingly to push past their boundaries and ignore the occasional melodrama will find a series which is dark, sensual, surprisingly funny, and utterly addicting.     Season 1 occasionally suffers from a lack of direction when it gets bogged down in subplots or mixed up in its own mythology. These problems seem cleared up by season 2. Give TRUE BLOOD a chance. You won't be disappointed. Buy this box.   V\\"\\"V

B003L16FAE|5.0|I'm really glad FOX made another version of Predator on BD. The Hunter Edition has all the special features from the \\"second disc DVD special edition.\\"   The picture quality is clear, and in BD quality for once.       For the past 20 years, I've watched this movie in VHS and DVD quality.  Now with BD out, its gonna take some time to get used to the clarity of the picture.  Its rich in detail and much clearer then any other version I seen before.  If your experiencing \\"plastic like figures\\" or \\"toy like effects,\\" then you might want to lower your color settings a bit.  The only thing I didn't like about this new version, is how noticeably old this movie looks.  Having a clear update look of Predator, you can see how this movie was made.  But this movie is still bad ass to watch!
0061743526|5.0|This is in response to the readers that did not like the quality of the hardcover book.  They seemed to feel that a 50th anniversary deserved a slicker presentation.  However for me, the book is perfect (story and paper quality).  As soon as I opened the box, I felt that I was 9 years old and staring at the bookcase that divided our  living room from the kitchen.  I often spent time searching the bulging shelves for a book to keep me company on the long, hot days in Austin, Texas.  I spot a new   addition on the bottom shelf.  It's not very impressive in contrast with the picture books of travel and natural wonders that I use as my guide to adventure.  The book is small and the colors on the dust jacket are drab.  The pages are  thick, dull and pulpy; like so many novels were printed on in the 1950's an 1960's.  There are absolutely no pictures or photographs in the whole book.  This alone usually would have doomed the book. Yet, the Texas weather compels me to find a literary  companion.  Outside no breeze stirs.  The air is heavy with moisture.  A soft patter of rain falls for several days.  The sky is a funny color and there is surely  a hurricane somewhere in the Gulf.  For three days, I enter the world of Jim and Scout.  I will return a different child; as will my three children and hopefully  all my grandchildren.  Thanks for sending me this glorious little book exactly the way I remembered it.

B002BSHXJA|1.0|I was very pleased to find the Beatles remastered mono box set at such a reasonable price. Well, if it sounds too good to be true...   Fresh out of the shipping packaging, they were clearly cheap (very cheap) bootlegs. The CD jackets featured very poorly printed photos and were crudely folded and glued together. In fact they mostly stuck to each other and the flimsy plastic inner sleeves. Pretty tatty- even by bootleg standards. Oh, and the enclosed booklet is in Japanese. And The box was dented. Needless to say I contacted the seller (twice)---and heard nothing. Still I am happy to report the recordings on the discs are the real deal and sound >incredible<. A real ear opener. At least in that I feel I got what I wanted for the money. But if you're thinking about getting this terrific package, spend the bucks, pounds, euros, whatever, buy from a reputable known source, get the whole package and >fully< enjoy the real thing.

B0037QGS0A|5.0|First, I would have to say this is Amanda's most emotional performance and Atom Egoyan's best film. Anyone that would compare this too a \\"Fatal Attraction or Basic instinct\\" would be incorrect. The story is a lot deeper than that, it's a story of love and being let down, misled and being used. I have been down this path many times so I can totally relate to Chloe's character in the movie. This is a film that you do not watch, you have to engage in it. So for those that can't pay attention to close detail? I wouldn't advise this film for you at all it will be a waste of time. I have seen some of the reviews from critics and they obviously didn't really watch the film. To say this is porn or even a simple story is just ridiculous! Chloe is a very depressed, lonely, emotional and intelligent character that will go to any extent to get what she needs. If you watch the movie most of the performance  takes place with her eyes and emotions, which is rare. Basically what I mean by this is, go by her face not what she speaks. This is not some predictable story where the girl goes crazy and kills everyone. This is not some over the top Sharon Stone performance either, so be prepared. This is a very realistic point of view of loving and needing to the extent of harming yourself even. In this particular film there was a contemporary world that was created in Toronto.  I am so intrigued with this movie for it's boldness, cinematography and locations. It is amazingly beautiful to look at for one, and the story is so straight forward to say the least. There are so many movies out there that play with the idea of bi-sexuality or homosexuality but never really show the emotional side of it. I felt that this film touched on a lot of interesting ideas as well as captivated the essence of sexuality. Amanda Seyfried's performance in this movie was astonishing as well as sensual and bold. This is a very disturbing movie but at the same time a guilty pleasure at best.       It actually conveys that looks aren't everything and just because your attractive you don't have everything. U have a insecure older woman that could except a beautiful younger woman? U have a husband that flirts with everything that walks ? I hope that I am not giving to many clues away about this film. But I suggest anyone that want to be turned on and enjoy seeing two beautiful women on screen. As well as some great atmosphere and some truly emotional performances? I would say \\"Chloe\\" is definitely your popcorn movie of the evening. Movies like \\"Jennifer's body, Poison IVY: The new seduction\\" and \\"The Girl Friend Experience\\" may be other ones that may be in your ball park. But if I had to choose the best, \\"Chloe\\" would be the winner  out of the three... easily. I even learned about some additional good music from this film \\"Raised by Swans\\" which reminds me of old Coldplay at there best. Atom Egoyan  really made a really dark and interesting journey through erotica and suspense. If you have ever seen the movie \\"EXOTICA\\" he is the director of that film as well. So what lengths would you go through to be with someone you love ? Watch \\"Chloe\\" you wont be disappointed I can assure you ! This movie was so stylish that I actually had to have the Blu-ray and man its beautiful. If you are a fan of Toronto Canada this is the film to watch. They had some really historic places in the film. The Windsor Arms hotel, Toronto's Art museum, and the Rivoli which are all nice sites. This is definitely the best film I have seen in a while its not something the U.S is capable of anymore. And the home that they lived in was like a Glass House/Art museum, you just have to see it. She had some very nice attire as well very flamboyant for a escort. She reminded me a lot of myself because I think I over do things at times. But anyway watch the film I think if you can appreciate good art you will not be disappointed. You have some good music, sexy buildings great atmosphere and some sexy women... whatmore can you ask for ?     Raised by Swans- No Ghostless place feat in the movie !    http://www.amazon.com/No-Ghostless-Place/dp/B00366GHEI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1281666502&sr=1-1-spell      \\"A Piece Of ART\\"

B001S86J0I|5.0|As I watched the dvd for the movie \\"Galaxy Quest,\\" I thought how surprised I was to have enjoyed what seemed as a cheesy family spoof. But the film turned to be an action adventure with some really hilarious moments. I loved the film. It has qualities of a successful science fiction drama, but also contains a variety of comical characters that had my whole family overwhelmed in laughter. \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is right up there with \\"Toy Story\\" in merit, it entertains adults and children alike, standing out as one of the year's best family films.<br /><br />The story details the adventures of a canceled television science fiction fantasy cast, similar in content to \\"Star Trek.\\" \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is the name of the program. In their years, the stars, including Jason Nesmith, Gwen DeMarco, Fred Kwan, Alexander Dane, and Tommy Webber, were some of the biggest, most popular names in TV. Now, their means of making a living is signing fans' autographs for a price and being cast in amateur presentations.<br /><br />There is very detailed character development here. The characters are wonderfully cast and brilliantly portrayed. Unfortunately, most family films don't contain the patience for such necessary material. We bond with these characters; they are likable, funny, energetic and independent. These individuals are the key of success to this kind of movie.<br /><br />The real plot begins when strange people come to Jason beging for him to save their existence from a powerful evil force who wishes to wipe them out of the universe forever. Naturally, at first our television star is skeptical, but when the strange people turn out to be humble aliens and transport Jason to their spaceship, he realizes this is something serious. The aliens begin to explain that they think he and his \\"Galaxy Quest\\" team are the only people in the universe who can save their race. He rushes to the members of his old cast and tries to justify his experience. He says that there are extraterrestrial creatures who require the help of their \\"Galaxy Quest\\" characters. None of his friends believe him, but once again give in when they find themselves transported off earth, onto the creature's spaceship. Of course, the aliens don't realize that their hopeful heroes are simply out of work actors, but who needs to tell them? So it is up to Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, Lt. Tawny Madison, Tech Sergeant Chen, Dr. Lazarus of Tev'Meck, and Lt.

1423113381|4.0|I don't know anything about Egyptian gods or anything.  So the first hundred pages I was absorbing information.  So it was a bit slow for me in the beginning then it picked up.   While alternating narration between Sadie and Carter I had a few times I got mixed up especially when I was in the middle of a chapter but I was able to figure it out especially with Sadie's English accent.  I also like how they interrupted the narration - like Carter interrupting Sadie and vice vers - it made the story humorous and reminded me that they were telling me the story after it already happened.  It is also the kind of things brothers and sisters do - interrupting each other or making a comment based on what the other said.    I liked how Sadie was the tough, rebellious one that didn't always do what she was told.  While her brother Carter was the opposite.  When they both found out that they're hosting gods it gets really interesting as the pieces of the puzzle come together.

B003HLM2QO|2.0|Well, another sub-par Ozzy album/CD.  I expected it was going to suck when I heard that Kevin Chunko; oh I mean Churko was the main writer.  Come on!!!  The last one sucked just as bad.  The songs just lack substance and are more for little teens or for people who listen to modern rock like Nikelback, Hinder, etc.  I know everyone has different tastes, but a rating of a 5. Come on!!!!  And people who rip on Gus G are just plain idiots and do not know anything about metal. If he had any input, which he did not since the music was already written by Mr. Churko before he joined, this would probably be a hell of a better CD.  Gus G can write killer riffs and music period.  The only good song is Diggin' Me Down and it is very good  The opener Let It Die is terrible with the exception of the small jammin part.  Soul Sucka is the same with some light of greatness.  I also like I Want It More.  The title track is catchy, but that is where it end.      We all have our own tastes and opinions, but this is one of Ozzy's worse next to Black Rain.  I have been listening to Ozzy since 1980 and this is huge let down.  I know he will never be the same as he was with Sabbath,Randy, Jake, or early Zakk, but I know can find the right people to make a great album/CD again even though his voice is shot.  It is obvious that Ozzy's success was the result of his reputation built around great song writers and players because almost every album gets worse since Ozzmosis.  Ditch Churko and brink in some real hard rock/metal song writers.     All I can say is thank goodness for the Blizzard/Diary 30th Anniversary CDs coming out soon.

B002VPE1B6|2.0|James Cameron is technically adept Salieri to a host of creative Mozarts, looting sci-fi/fantasy lore for gems, wrapping them loosely around the skeleton plot of Dances With Wolves, sprinkling green and transhumanist propaganda, and using modern SFX to rub your nose in the result: a cinematic equivalent of Shock And Awe. One possible benefit is that CG SFX and trite cliches have been taken about as far as they can go as a cover for lack of substance. People will only sink their teeth into wax fruit so many times.    That said, it was a pleasure to see Sigourney Weaver again. She's a terrific actress.    The movie is clearer and sharper without 3D, which was distracting and made my eyes hurt.
0307454541|5.0|This book is the first in The Millennium Trilogy - a set of crime novels set in Sweden. If you don't know the story behind this series it goes as follows. The author, a Swedish journalist, delivered three completed manuscripts to his publisher - something he had done on his off-time as a \\"hobby\\" - and then shortly after, dropped dead of a massive heart attack at the age of 50 in 2004. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was published posthumously and quickly became an international best seller.<br /><br />The novel's protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, is a financial reporter who is found guilty of libel as the book opens. Biding his time before he serves his three month jail term he is hired - out of the blue - by a retired corporate titan, under the guise of ghostwriting the old man's autobiography and family history. Mikael soon learns his real task is to investigate the 40 year old disappearance of said older gentleman's great-niece. Reluctantly Mikael accepts - it isn't as if he has much else to do - and the literary roller-coaster ride begins.<br /><br />This book has all a reader can hope for to make a great read. Several compelling story lines expertly intertwined, a cast of well developed and believable characters - including our tattooed girl - and enough twists and turns to keep the reader turning the pages. Once I got past the Swedish names and geography - something I take full responsibility for - I simply couldn't put this book down - something I rarely concede.<br /><br />This book has been recommended repeatedly to me over the last year or so and because I am a stubborn pain in the butt - I resisted. Silly me. The conclusion is somewhat rushed and there is a soap-opera hook to the ending which seemed unnecessary, but those are nits. This is an excellent novel and I look forward to reading the next two books.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B003JSU2NU|5.0|These soundtracks get better and better as the movies progress.  This one is a 5 star. The sound is more upbeat and a bit edgy. Not just one or two favorites on this soundtrack - all of them are great. Most especially Heavy in Your Arms, Chop and Change, Million Miles an Hour, Jonathan Lowe. The love song on this soundtrack is also a favorite - Our Love. Even if you don't care for the Twlight Movies this is a definte buy.
B0037QGRZG|5.0|The early '80s was a time when coming-of-age films and underdog turned victorious style of films dominated the box office.  One of the films that captured the attention of many and still is a time classic today is the 1984 film \\"The Karate Kid\\" directed by John G Avildsen (\\"Rocky\\", \\"Lean on Me\\", \\"Inferno\\") and a screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen (\\"Gladiator\\", \\"Taps\\", \\"Lethal Weapon 3', \\"The Fifth Element\\").<br /><br />The film was an amazing hit at the box office, making over $90 million, receive rave reviews from critics and would later spawn several sequels, a television show and would earn actor Pat Morita an Academy Award nomination for \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" and elevate the popularity teen-hearthrob Ralph Macchio to great heights.<br /><br />With the 2010 remake of \\"The Karate Kid\\" starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, what best to reacquaint audiences of the first two films (the third and fourth films were panned) which makes its HD debut on Blu-ray with a special \\"Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition\\", the Blu-ray release of the film will also be sold separately.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Before I watched this film on Blu-ray, I had the opportunity to watch the 2005 DVD version and the first things that caught my attention was how the film looked its age.  But I have seen how older films can look incredible on Blu-ray and with \\"The Karate Kid\\", although the opening sequences may show its age, the film looks absolutely beautiful for a 26-year-old film.<br /><br />A lot of early '80s films didn't exactly utilize the best film stock and sometimes the film quality looks DNR'd or a bit cloudy and waxy.  This was not the case of \\"The Karate Kid\\".  Detail is much more apparent with the objects and surroundings and also there is a good amount of grain with this release.<br /><br />Outdoor sequences look quite vibrant and reds, yellows and orange colors look quite nice and some colors really do pop.  Blacks are nice and deep and overall, this is the best I have seen of this film and probably the best picture quality of \\"The Karate Kid\\" we are going to see of this film in a long time.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For the most part, the majority of the film is dialogue driven.  I noticed the music such as Bananarama's \\"Cruel Summer\\" really sound quite nice in lossless, especially Bill Conti's music which definitely sounds great in HD.<br /><br />There are some moments with crowd ambiance or clanging when Daniel is trying to jump the fence but the majority of the surround that one will hear is during the tournament when the audience definitely is heard all around you.  So, the majority of the surround channels are utilized towards the end of the film.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" comes with the following special features (presented in standard definition):<br /><br />  *<br />  * Blu-Pop (TM): Activate the exclusive Blu-pop feature to reveal pop up trivia, interviews and more secrets from the film!  Watch Ralph Macchio and William Zabka discuss their experience of working on \\"The Karate Kid\\".<br />  * \\"Beyond the Form\\" Featurette - (13:03) Pat E. Johnson, martial arts master and choreographer explains what karate is and how he wanted to make the karate look realistic in \\"The Karate Kid\\" and training the talent.<br />  * Commentary with Director John G. Avildsen, Writer Robert Mark Kamen and Actors Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita - The original director's commentary from \\"The Karate Kid\\" 2005 DVD release.  It was great to hear all three together and to hear Pat Morita reminisce about those years and have a lot of fun.  Really fun commentary, especially in regards to the filming of the tournament.<br />  * \\"East Meets West: A Composer's Notebook\\" - (8:17) Composer Bill Conti talks about composing a movie and what he wanted to accomplish with \\"The Karate Kid\\".<br />  * \\"Life of Bonsai\\" Featurette - (10:00) A featurette about the bonsai tree.<br />  * \\"The Way of the Karate Kid\\" Part 1 Featurette\\" - (23:59) Robert Mark Kamen talks about writing the screenplay for \\"The Karate Kid\\".  Direct John G. Avildsen and Robert Mark Kamen talking about the cast, Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita talks about auditioning for the role.  The cast talks about being part of the film and working with director John Avildsen.<br />  * \\"The Way of the Karate Kid\\" Part 2 Featurette\\" - (21:25) The cast talk about director John Avildsen's talent.  Also, information on the filming of the martial arts tournament.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition\\" comes with a cardboard slipcase which contains both Karate Kid films on Blu-ray.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" was one of those inspirational coming-of-age, underdog becomes victorious films that were so indicative of the '80s.  Along with films such as \\"Vision Quest\\" and \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\", \\"The Karate Kid\\" was a fantastic film that definitely made me and many of my classmates want to sign up for karate class.<br /><br />Ralph Macchio wasn't this hulking actor, known for his work at the time on TV series such as \\"Eight is Enough\\" and the film \\"The Outsiders\\" (1983), Macchio does a fantastic job playing Daniel,a skinny guy who learns martial arts from a book and we sympathize with him as he is a person who is constantly being bullied, getting beaten up by the jocks and I can easily remember the audience in the theater in applause after Daniel's crane-kick.  The other time I ever recall seeing this was for \\"Rocky IV\\".  But really, when you think about the character, I don't know anyone at that time who could have played a convincing Daniel.  Macchio was perfect for the role!<br /><br />Pat Morita did a wonderful job playing Mr. Miyagi.  Having watched Morita play Arnold on \\"Happy Days\\", it was great to see him in such an important supporting role and although it would seem both Mr. Miyagi and Daniel would be like oil and water, the two manage to have great chemistry onscreen.  One of the most interesting lines from the film was when Miyagai talks about Okinawa as his country and I'm sure many people caught that and said, \\"Okinawa is not a country\\".  But this was smart on Robert Mark Kamen's part as a writer (especially leading to the second Karate Kid film) as Okinawan's viewpoint towards Japan and how natives of the island have looked at Okinawa as a separate nation especially since the culture and language is much different than Japan.<br /><br />As \\"The Karate Kid\\" proved to be successful and has done well for the careers of Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita, Elisabeth Shue who plays the love interest would also benefit from the film's popularity and eventually would lead to major roles in \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" (1987) and \\"Cocktail\\" (1988).<br /><br />And also credit has to go to Billy Zabka (who plays Johnny Lawrence) and the guys of Cobra Kai.  You couldn't help but hate these guys as they were the epitome of jock bullies that were so full of themselves.  Their performance helped elevate Ralph Macchio's game and made you want to see the underdog come victorious.  And add Martin Kove as John Kreese, the necessary evil who dictates how his students should fight in the tournament.<br /><br />For many people who grew up during the time \\"The Karate Kid\\" was in theaters or watched it ad infinitum on cable, sure the film is definitely nostalgic but even 26-years-later, the film still manages to hold up quite well and is still as enjoyable as when I first watched it in 1984.  And to make things much more impressive, the film looks and sounds great on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" has everything that people - young and old can appreciate.  An enjoyable, inspiring film that will no doubt continue to entertain future generations.  It's pretty surreal to read the various message boards from people who were not even born with this film came out but yet has as much as passion as one who did grow up around that time period.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a big fan of \\"The Karate Kid\\", this Blu-ray is definitely worth owning.  And if you enjoy the second film as well, \\"The Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition\\" is the version you most like would want to buy.  Nevertheless, \\"The Karate Kid\\" is a definite classic and is definitely recommended!istry onscreen.

B003NFM3KE|5.0|Just received my 2 copies of \\"Disney's A Christmas Carol\\" in 2D with Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack and a Slipcover via FedEx from Mexico online retailer. In Spanish we call it \\"Los Fantasmas de Scrooges.\\" The package itself is shrink-wrapped together with the slipcover instead of the cases alone. On front of that cover, there's a blue circle sticker says \\"Looking into a ticket inside to see - The Sorcerer's Apprentice - only in theaters.\\" After removing the shrink-wrap, I could see shiny, glossy & embossed figuring/lettering on the front slipcover and glossy/mirror on the back. Upon opening the cases, there are AD insert in tri-fold, Hollywood Movie Money ticket, and \\"Tron: Legacy\\" Holographic 15cm ruler. DVD disc on the left side and Blu-ray disc on the right. Loaded Blu-ray disc on the PS3 player. On the screen, there are multi-languages setting before going to the Root Menu. Once there, on the Root Menu, it plays a Christmas Theme on the background with animated snow flake flying in the air. On that screen, it says 93 minutes of running, Play, Selection and Setup. In setup, the languages are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Malaysia and more, all in Dolby Digital 5.1. In subtitles, its the same as languages plus many more. The ratio aspect is 1.78:1 in widescreen. Its Region A for Blu-ray and Regions 1 & 4 for DVD, but both disc appeared to be 100% Region Free tested on LG BH200 player. On the opening screen, there are less trailers including Beauty and the Beast in Blu-ray, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in Cinemas, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice in Cinemas. While watching the film, the sound and picture looks amazing, blast and clear! I thought to myself that 3D looks better but realized Blu-ray looks better in 2D because I was sitting very close in front of 32\\" Toshiba 1080p LCD HDTV. My favorite part where the Ebenezer Scrooge & candle were flying very fast through the snow. I was overwhelming that I could almost fell my chair from that flying scene. Again, where the old laughing Santa Claus & Scrooge were flying underneath the floor, I felt like my body swings back and forth. At the end of the scene, after he fell off his grave, I got scared and excited at the same time! I don't know what kind of reaction is that, lol! I know its not Christmas time while we're in Summer. Remember those are 2D & barebone, and its doesn't have 3D or special feature yet until this November. I suggest you to wait for November release to get 4 disc combo pack at cheaper discount, since I paid at retail price for this.
B00164GDE6|4.0|In 1995, director Michael Bay made his directorial debut with \\"Bad Boys\\".  Featuring a story by George Gallo and a screenplay by late show writers Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland and Doug Richardson (\\"Die Hard II\\", \\"Money Train\\") and  produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, despite being shot on a very low budget ($19 million), the film was a huge box office success making over $141 million in the box office .<br /><br />\\"Bad Boys\\" would further the onscreen status of then-television show leads Will Smith and Martin Lawrence into movie stardom and would solidify Michael Bay's status as an action director.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Bad Boys\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For the most part, the Blu-ray release definitely marks a much better looking version of the film.  You can see the skin pores on the characters, more detail in the characters as you can see the freckles on Tea Leoni's face much more clearly.  Blacks are nice and deep.  Outdoor scenes are vibrant and colorful and for the most part, for a 15-year-old film, fans of the film will definitely enjoy the PQ.  I didn't see any aliasing, edge enhancement or any artifacting.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Bad Boys\\" shines in the lossless department.  With this film being an action-driven film, there are times where you hear explosions and gun shots whizzing from left to right via the surround channels.  I also noticed some shots utilizing LFE.  But there was one scene where I felt it nearly blew my eardrum off because I had my system pumped up quite loudly.  But the film definitely sounds incredible via lossless.  Dialogue and music is clear and understandable through the front and center channels but there is good use of surround for the action segments.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Bad Boys\\" comes with the following special features presented in standard definition, English Stereo with Spanish or Portuguese subtitles:<br /><br />  * movieIQ(tm)+sync (use logo) and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie!<br />  * Commentary with Director Michael Bay - Featured on the original DVD release, Michael Bay talks about the making of the film, working with the talent and the crew and how certain scenes were created.

Some may find the partnership between the two as just another cliche cop duo film and for the most part, I guess you can see it at that way but if you were a fan of these two, you were going to enjoy their interaction and their humor.  And possible the smartest thing that Bay allowed (because he didn't like the script all that much) was to give Lawrence and Smith a chance to improvise their lines and have fun with it.<br /><br />But if anything, \\"Bad Boys\\" was that film that lifted director Michael Bay and Will Smith's names to new heights.  After this film, Will Smith was no longer the TV star but now a bonafide action star and followed up with \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Men in Black\\", while Director Michael Bay would have a string of box office hits with \\"The Rock\\" and \\"Armageddon\\".<br /><br />If this film proved anything, it was that Michael Bay knew what staff to work with because with such a low budget to work with, they accomplished a lot special effects-wise with very little (note: \\"Bad Boys\\" was budgeted at $19 million, Bay's next film \\"The Rock\\" was budgeted at $75 million).<br /><br />\\"Bad Boys\\" was like your usual copy duo films.  May it be \\"Lethal Weapon, \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\", \\"48 Hours\\" (two friends/partners who have their own problems with one another) but when you have two African American talent who can play off each other so well, it made the film very entertaining.  The comedy and action was just right and I understand the critics feeling the film doesn't break any new ground but in 1995, I felt the timing was right for the film and for the most part, movie watchers agreed with the pairing as seen with the massive amount of money that \\"Bad Boys\\" had made.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the Blu-ray definitely looks much better than the DVD and the lossless soundtrack is awesome.  But if there is one thing where the special DVD slightly has an edge over the Blu-ray edition is that it does have the \\"Damage Control\\" which used angles to analyze special effects explosions and also an isolated music score which are not included on the Blu-ray.  So, if you enjoy those special features, you may want to hang on to your special edition DVD version.  But otherwise, the Blu-ray release of \\"Bad Boys\\" is much better than its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of \\"Bad Boys\\", definitely give this Blu-ray release a chance!a low budget to work with, they accomplished a lot special effects-wise with very little (note: \\"Bad Boys\\" was budgeted at $19 million, Bay's next film \\"The Rock\\" was budgeted at $75 million).    \\"Bad Boys\\" was like your usual copy duo films.

B003LAH7MU|2.0|Big fan of Sting, but this is a weak effort.  I put the CD in driving home the first time, and the whole thing played before I even realized it was on - it's just elevator music.  Listened a second time, and it didn't get any better.  Give me 'The Soul Cages' or any of his other real albums any day.<br /><br />Maybe Sting and Peter Gabriel should spend the rest of their days just making tribute albums to each other...
B001HN6940|3.0|\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is Tim Burton-lite but that will appeal to the young and old, without becoming overly dark or twisted.<br /><br />The 2010 film directed by Tim Burton (\\"Corpse Bride\\", \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\", \\"Beetlejuice\\") and a screenplay by Linda Woolverton (\\"The Lion Queen\\", \\"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey\\", \\"Beauty & the Beast\\") is loosely based on the Lewis Carrol 1903 classic \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\".<br /><br />Featuring a production by Team Todd (The Austin Powers films, \\"Memento\\", \\"Across the Universe\\"), the 2010 Disney incarnation received a lot of buzz when the announcement was made that the film would feature a reunion of both director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp but the that the film would feature a cast tat would include Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman and many more.  The film would also receive buzz about the creation of the world of Wonderland and the extensive use of CG, especially with its steep production budgeted at around $200 million.<br /><br />Despite receiving reviews that were 50/50 from film critics, there is no denying that a Tim Burton film would bring people to the theaters and in this case, the Burton and Depp mystique would help bring in over $996 million dollars in the box office.  The film would achieve the sixth highest grossing opening weekend of all time and the highest opening weekend for a non-sequel and also surpassing \\"Avatar\\" in the IMAX and is currently the highest grossing film of 2010.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and for the most part, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a film that showcases a great amount of detail on Blu-ray but in terms of colors, for example, Alice going with her mother for a party, the color seem quite muted (like it's overcast) and I looked at it as a way for the film to show the viewer how Alice was a bit disenchanted with her life.  When she falls into the hole, we notice a different, surreal landscape that was created digitally.<br /><br />In fact, you will see in the special features that a large part of the film was created alongside a green screen, so for the most part, the film is CG-heavy and one can expect gorgeous CG graphics for Wonderland.  Blacks are nice and deep and scenes such as the Red Queen's lair and the use of reds are quite vibrant.  And as mentioned, there is a good amount of detail.  From Mad Hatter's hat to the tea party and more.<br /><br />As for the DVD version that is included with the three-disc Blu-ray release, the DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 (enhanced for 16×9 televisions).<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS,  Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The lossless audio was very well done as the film is quite immersive.  From crowd ambiance, to the smallest noises created by the Red Queen's servants to the thunder clouds approaching nearby, to the galloping horses, the march of the soldiers and more.  Dialogue is crystal clear through the front channels as Danny Elfman's music utilizes the front channels while the surrounds utilize the special effects.  From Alice falling through the hole and hitting various objects to the various characters running from the Red Queen's soldiers and more.<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" may not be action-heavy but the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is no slouch either.

The 3-Disc release comes with a slip cover featuring artwork different than the main cover insert.  Also, the film comes with a DVD version of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and a Digital Copy.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Tim Burton was able to create a magical world of Wonderland with its characters with the heavy use of CG.  The film was literally filmed with a big green screen all around and people having to wear it while most of the work was then added via post-production in making sure the characters, the scenery and of courts the animals and inhabitants of this world are captured quite well in the film.  So, I had no doubt that the Blu-ray release would look good because mostly everything is CG-driven.<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a film that was received 50/50 and for the majority of the critics who are familiar with the Lewis Carrol novel, the film was a major deviation from the actual story.  Whereas the novel was about a young Alice who ends up in Wonderland and interacts with the inhabitants of the land including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen and Duchess and literally an adventurous experience of a girl in a new land.<br /><br />As for the Linda Woolverton screenplay, the film is about a young adult Alice who faces adulthood.  Not knowing how to explain her emotions and being asked to take part in a marriage (in which she doesn't love the man), she just wants to escape.  In Wonderland, this escape from reality is where Alice gets to know her true self and learn how to stand up for herself without anyone calling the shots in her life.  Call it a coming-of-age film, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" deals with a young woman not knowing her true strength but when her life and her new friends lives are in danger, she is the only one that can defeat the Red Queen's biggest weapon.  She may not think that it is possible but her brief stay in Wonderland will eventually be an incredible test.<br /><br />Typically, I am a reviewer who tends to find CG-driven films to be quite banal of late.  Granted, \\"Avatar\\" was a film that was extremely well-crafted and as for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", I actually enjoyed the world that Tim Burton and staff was able to create. Wonderland may be lush but a CG film can only go so far.  It depends on the characters and its storyline.  And reading a number of reviews, the film was split 50/50 for critics who enjoyed it or those who felt the film was to astray when compared to the original novel or just more eye candy and an unappealing film.<br /><br />Sean P. Menas, film critic for The Salt Lake Tribune wrote, \\"Burton's overamped, visually frenetic and chaotically action-heavy adaptation of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" manages to be both too much and not enough of what a retelling of Alice should be.\\"<br /><br />I have to agree with Sean P. Menas and that \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a film that could have been an amazing trilogy if given the chance.  As I pondered about the film, sure, images of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" came to mind but it would have been great if there was more to the story of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" because 109 minutes did not seem enough.  And I felt that Tim Burton's storyline was diluted by its pacing of trying to get from point A to point B so quickly that I found myself more in-tuned with Alice's character and Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was just a creepy character that needed more time.  Even the Cheshire Cat which was so instrumental in the novel was left with very little in the film.<br /><br />Michael Smith of the Tulsa World writes, \\"A disappointment on a massive scale canvas, Burton's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a beautiful, giant bore that's almost comedy-free. It may be of some interest to adults, but kids will be bored to tears, unless they don't listen to the leaden dialogue and imagine they are watching a new video game.\\"<br /><br />Although, I didn't find \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a giant bore, I found it to be entertaining and felt it was a film that had potential but in the end, making you feel it was OK or good but not fantastic.  I can't call the film a disappointment on a massive scale, especially as it is one of the highest grossing films of all time.  I also feel that with the pairing of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, the films success was facile and if anything, their pairing would lead to financial box office success but I may not be an erudite when it comes to the original novel's storyline but I do feel for the film, the story of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" could have led to more sequels and stretch out the story to make us care for the characters and even Wonderland itself.<br /><br />We are told that Alice has been to the Wonderland many times before, even painting roses for the Red Queen and this is where I find the biggest fault of the film.  The original novel would have served a better first film for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", taking her to adulthood and bringing her back as featured in this film as a sequel.  This would have made sense and a much more engaging film.<br /><br />I did enjoy Mia Wasikowska as Alice.  She fit the part of a young woman trying to find herself and both Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway did a wonderful job playing the queens.  And Johnny Depp, he was wonderful as the Mad Hatter but for each of these three characters, once again, I just felt there was more storyline for these characters that could have been developed.  I felt there was too much emphasis on the glitz and the look of the world while watching a girl who was trying to find her inner strength.  Granted, that was the writer's intention but for all these characters introduced, including the CG animated animals who play a major part in the film, it would have been great to see these characters explored a bit more.  If anything, making the viewer care enough to see them rescued or have created some emotional connect to them.  I just felt the pacing of the film was a bit rushed.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, there is no doubt that \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a beautiful film with tremendous detail.  The lossless soundtrack is very good.  A good amount of special features and you do get a DVD and digital copy for the 3-disc release.  So, as a total package, its a pretty solid Blu-ray release from Disney.  If you enjoyed the film, you will most definitely enjoy the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, I was content with \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and I'm sure that both parents and children may find the film entertaining.  Those who are familiar with the original story may feel the storyline's deviance from Lewis Carroll's work to be too much of a difference and for children, for the most part, this is a safe film with not much violent content until the latter end of the film in which Alice goes against the Jabberwocky.  Some parents might find the scene a bit too much for younger children and in that case, parental guidance is suggested.<br /><br />But for me, I felt the film had tremendous potential but missed its target.  Sure, it was a box office success but as  I watched the film alongside with my seven-year-old son, after the film was done, the words that came out of his mouth was  \\"is that it?\\"  And like my son, I felt the same way about \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"... \\"is that it?\\".And reading a number of reviews, the film was split 50/50 for critics who enjoyed it or those who felt the film was to astray when compared to the original novel or just more eye candy and an unappealing film.

1439153663|3.0|In the late 1700's, Irish seven-year-old Lavinia loses her parents on the voyage to America. As they were indentured to the owner of a Southern plantation, she finds herself living in the plantation's \\"kitchen house\\" with the slaves, who become her family despite her white skin.  The novel alternates between the retrospective point of view of Lavinia and the real-time point of view of Belle, a half-white slave who becomes a surrogate mother/sister to Lavinia.  Through multiple tragedies and fewer triumphs, Lavinia and Belle remain loyal to each other despite the dangerous dynamics of relationship between free and slave, white and black.<br /><br />Given some of the reviews, I half expected the conclusion to annoy me with utter, excessive tragedy.  Personally, I found it mostly inevitable.  Sad, yes, but realistically so, and not without a few hopeful spots.<br /><br />The author's research is meticulous: not only physical details like the food and furniture of this time period, but also the assumptions and attitudes of the people who lived then.  I did feel a bit of a vacuum concerning the politics of the time.  Surely even an insular plantation would have been at least somewhat concerned with national events?  The dialects don't utilize gimmicks like dropped g's and phonetic spelling, so I was able to hear the characters' voices without laboring to sound out what they said.  Also, especially given the size of her cast, the author makes her characters surprisingly sympathetic, though some remain more archetype than individual.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing style prevents this book from achieving greatness.  Lavinia's method of looking back isolates the reader from the action of the story.  She summarizes huge sections of her life, which is necessary to a point, given how much time passes during this novel (about 15 years).  But she also summarizes conversations or events that should be structured as immediate scenes with action and dialogue, such as (p. 20): \\"I began to keep aside a bit of my evening meal, and in the morning I could hardly wait to give Ben my offering. He never failed to show surprise and always ate it with a great show of pleasure. One day, in return, Ben presented me with a bird nest he had found.\\"  Also (p. 194): \\"...[H]e ... announced his disfavor of women studying Latin. Meg quickly replied that immature men with strong opinions were, by her estimation, very dull indeed.  There was a long silence ... I fought unsuccessfully to recall a favorable subject to engage our stunned guests.\\"  Summaries like this occur throughout the entire book and deaden the tension.  Even the final page suffers from this technique.<br /><br />Had Lavinia's point of view been styled more like Belle's, I might have loved this book.  None of the characters is flawless, yet they face abuse with grace, predicament with resourcefulness.  They outwardly fight for their humanity when they can and inwardly cling to it when they can't.  The historical setting is well drawn.  But the excessive summaries kept pushing me away from the characters and dulling the power of the events.  When I finished it, I realized that THE KITCHEN HOUSE had interested me but never fully engaged me.  If Ms. Grissom writes another historical novel, I won't rush to purchase it, but I might pick it up to scan a few pages and see if I can put it down.e a bit of my evening meal, and in the morning I could hardly wait to give Ben my offering.

B0038M2RL2|4.0|There was no doubt that the coming-of-age film \\"The Karate Kid\\" which made over $90 million in the box office would earn itself a sequel.  Two years later, director John G Avildsen (\\"Rocky\\", \\"Lean on Me\\", \\"Inferno\\") and writer Robert Mark Kamen (\\"Gladiator\\", \\"Taps\\", \\"Lethal Weapon 3', \\"The Fifth Element\\") would reunite once again with composers Bill Conti, cinematographer James Crabe and cast members Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio for \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\".<br /><br />The film did much better than its predecessor in the box office making over $245 million worldwide and the theme song \\"Glory of Love\\" by Peter Cetera would receive the #1 song in the U.S. as well as earn an Academy Award nomination for \\"Best Song\\".<br /><br />With the 2010 remake of \\"The Karate Kid\\" starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, what best to reacquaint audiences of the first two films (the third and fourth films were panned) which makes its HD debut on Blu-ray with a special \\"Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition\\", the Blu-ray release of the film will also be sold separately.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Similar to the first film, I was able to watch the original DVD release before watching it on Blu-ray.  And like the first film, on DVD the film looked its age.  But I can easily say that this film looks much, much better on Blu-ray.  The film was shot in Hawaii and for the most part, the leaves, trees, rocks and the overall surroundings have much better detail than the DVD which looked a bit blurry and had a significant amount of digital noise reduction.<br /><br />You can easily make out the leaves and trees, even one scene in which Miyagi and Yukie are sitting down and seeing the river flow near the home was such a beautiful shot and almost looked like a film that was just shot recently.  So, there are some amazing shots in the film and the set design in creating the castle area and the overall village really showed the determination of cinematographer Bill Conti and production designer William J. Cassidy in making the Hawaii area look and feel like Okinawa.<br /><br />Like the first film, there is a good amount of grain and also blacks are nice and deep.  I saw no signs of artifacts, blemishes or any problems with the film.  \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\" definitely looks great for a film that is nearly 25-years-old and way better than its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And like the first film, \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\" is dialogue driven.  But like the first film, there is a good amount of surround use.  From the storm that hits the village and hearing the thunder, to hearing the ambiance of the village especially when Sato's people using their bulldozer to tear up the farming area in front of Miyagi's home.  You can also hear the birds, the military jet flying overhead and more. And similar to the first film which featured the crowd's gasps during the martial arts tournament, we hear the crowd reacting to the final battle of the film.<br /><br />Also, a good presence of music from composer Bill Conti and of course, Peter Cetera's \\"Glory of Love\\".  But overall, the lossless soundtrack for this film is very good and definitely breathes new life for this film and again, much better over its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\" comes with the following special features (presented in standard definition):<br /><br />  * Blu-Pop (TM): Activate the exclusive Blu-pop feature to reveal pop up trivia, interviews and more secrets from the film!<br />  * The Sequel - (6:18) Producer Jerry Weintraub, director John G. Avildsen and writer Robert Mark Kamen along with the cast, discuss the making of \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition\\" comes with a cardboard slipcase which contains both Karate Kid films on Blu-ray.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\" was a film that I called inspirational and enjoyable, \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\" was a film which I enjoyed a lot and at the time, I enjoyed much more than its predecessor.  I felt the film added a new emotional dimension for its characters and the relationship between Miyagi and Daniel, also the beauty of the village and the location definitely enhanced the film.  Once again, Pat Morita does a fantastic job and this time to see the character pushed to the limit.<br /><br />I was very impressed by Pat Morita's performance and singing in Japanese and just making his character seem so realistic and making us believe in that character.  Miyagi has quite a few action scenes and this is not bad for an actor who was born in California, let alone a man who was born with spinal tuberculosis and was not expected to walk earlier in his life.<br /><br />The character of Daniel LaRusso was also played quite well by Ralph Macchio. There was no major American machismo in the film and if anything, more of a naivete as he tries to understand the customs and the ways in Okinawa.  It is known that there has been this tension between America's occupation in Okinawa and Robert Mark Kamen made sure there were lines that existed in the film especially when Daniel and Miyagi were talking about the war and the lives lost.  Especially in the beginning of the film about how peaceful the village was until the military base was created.  These issues continue to exist between American and Okinawa relationships.<br /><br />Macchio's chemistry with actress Tamlyn Tomita worked quite well onscreen and similar to Elisabeth Shue, the film helped Tomita in achieving roles in \\"Santa Barbra\\" and most notable \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" years later.<br /><br />But \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\" was a film that I thought was much better then but watching it now, it was quite banal and aside from the performances of Pat Morita, watching it now, I'm not sure if the enjoyment was more for the fact that I thought the film was shot in Okinawa (when actually it was in Hawaii) or I felt that the major battle in the film was extraordinary at a young age.  But it was an enjoyable film especially to watch it again over 20-years later but my appreciation towards the film has waned a bit since then.<br /><br />But I can easily remember Peter Cetera's \\"Glory of Love\\" being played on the radio over and over and seeing the video clip on MTV, needless to say, the second film had more marketing and hype to make it this major box office hit nearly tripling the box office return of the fim.<br /><br />I suppose in terms of the buildup of wanting to see Daniel beat the Cobra-kai's in the first film was inspiring and you were rooting for the character, \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\" was more of a film where you wondered how does Daniel even fit into this equation when the film deals primarily with Miyagi.  But the film does work itself out and overall, it was good film but overall, watching the two Karate Kid films again, I appreciated the original film much more today.<br /><br />John G. Avildsen and Robert Mark Kamen were able to create two enjoyable films but similar to the \\"Superman\\" films, everything past the second film seemed to go downhill and thus, I can see why Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has focused on the first two films on Blu-ray.<br /><br />And if you enjoyed the two Karate Kid films, there is no doubt in my mind you will want to purchase this on Blu-ray.  Comparing it to the 2005 DVD's, not only does the film look much better but it also sounds much better and the lossless audio makes your viewing are come alive as the surround channels really do utilize the crowd scenes during the end of both films.<br /><br />Overall, two enjoyable films and if you enjoyed \\"The Karate Kid, Part II\\",  more than likely you enjoyed the first.  So, I definitely recommended \\"The KarateKid I & II Collector's Edition\\"!  Definitely recommended!was in Hawaii) or I felt that the major battle in the film was extraordinary at a young age.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|Very good movie*Liked NOT having to listen to swearing all the time*Inspirational*I had no problem hearing with earphones or when real quiet, but  older folks commented when I loaned the film to other families that they had problems hearing the quiet voices of   'Mandela'  and  Matt Damon  when the background crowds were loud.  However,  overall,  they too got the 'gist'  of the film and liked it anyway.  I  recommend this film to others to  buy. Good film.
B00386OWUC|5.0|Austrian Director Michael Haneke is one of cinema's most revered and also most reviled with films that are typically bleak or disturbing, nerve-rattling and shocking.<br /><br />From his first major film \\"The Seventh Continent\\"  of modern alienation to his next film \\"Benny's Video\\" about a 14-year-old who is fascinated by watching violent acts via playback on video, his shocking \\"Funny Games\\" (which was remade in the US) to the titillating 2002 film \\"The Piano Teacher\\" which won three major awards at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival comes his award winning film \\"The White Ribbon\\".<br /><br />Known as \\"Das wei&szlig;e Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte\\", \\"The White Ribbon\\" is a black and white film which premiered at the 62nd Cannes International Film Festival in 2009 and won the highly covered Palme d'Or and also the 2010 Golden Globe Award for \\"Best Foreign Language Film\\" and also nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />\\"The White Ribbon\\" is a film that has been in development for more than a decade and Haneke has said of the film as about \\"the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature\\".  Haneke said it best when he described the film as children following the idealism of their parent's generation but followed it blindly.  That when you follow idealism blindly, they become inhuman and that this is the root of every form of terrorism.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The White Ribbon\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and is in black and white.  I've read before watching the film that \\"The White Ribbon\\" was shot in color with the color removed but for the most part, blacks are nice and deep and there is a nice contrast with grays and whites really popping out.  I was very impressed with the cinematography by Christian Berger, capturing the variety of emotions in the film.  You get the sense through the production and costume design that this film is a classic film when actually it was filmed in 2009.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The White Ribbon\\" is presented in German 5.1 DTS-HD MA, English Narration, German Dialog subbed in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is dialogue driven and is not a film that really sports any sound effects or any major action scenes.  The film is primarily center and front channel driven with the dialogue being crystal clear and understandable (if you understand German) and there are sequences with crowd ambiance and a scene when you can hear a scythe cutting through cabbages.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English and English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The White Ribbon\\" comes with the following special features (in standard definition, audio is in French and German stereo with English subtitles):<br /><br />  Making of the White Ribbon - (38:40) A featurette about the making of \\"The White Ribbon\\" and showcasing director Michael Haneke's arrival to the Cannes Film Festival.<br />  * my life - (50:09) A documentary on director Michael Haneke featuring interviews with family, friends and talent who have worked with him in his previous films and also footage of the behind-the-scenes post production work on \\"The White Ribbon\\".<br />  * Cannes film festival premiere - (18:36) - Featuring the premiere at Cannes International Film Festival.  From the red carpet to the Q&A panel and the film winning the Palme d'Or.<br />  * an interview with Michael Haneke - (14:08)  Director Michael Haneke talks about how \\"The White Ribbon\\" came about, what he wanted to accomplish with the film and why it was shot in black and white with narration.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:21) The original theatrical trailer.<br />  * Previews - Previews for upcoming Sony Pictures Classics releases.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The White Ribbon\\" is a film that has the touch of a classic film and also probably in director Michael Haneke's oeuvre, a true masterpiece.  Haneke knows how to make the audience feel uncomfortable and its the point of the film to open the viewer's eyes of idealism shattered and radicalism, extremism breeding and eventually planting the seeds to terrorism.<br /><br />The film is literally a look at society within a small village during the early 20th century.  Old customs, old idealism and a time where leadership revolved around an employer, its pastor and a doctor. But as these three characters are a big part of \\"The White Ribbon\\", the film is about the oppression and idealism that children must follow and there is no one wanting to rise against the main leadership in the village.<br /><br />In the Baron's case, we get to see the children wanting to act on impulse against the Baron.  As he represents the rich who is oppressing the poor, none of the adults are willing to stand up.  There is no union representing employees, there is no voice amongst the villagers and the children can't understand why things are the way they are.  They just see this rich family, a selfish Baron and his wife and their many employees and young son who gets everything he wants and is nothing like them.<br /><br />The Baron and his family are the most privileged people in the village.  They are rich and aren't afraid to flaunt their riches and the adults respect that position in power and no matter how much work they have to do, it's the way of the village.  But for the children, some are growing tired of it and you have a sense that they have had enough of seeing their parents literally having to be bend over backwards for them.<br /><br />The pastor is ultra-conservative and it's one thing to have unruly children, but at his home, the pastor is incredibly strict and can easily be seen as the religious fanatic.  His eldest daughter and son have a hint of trouble making personalities who don't understand why certain things in life, they get punished for it.  From being late, to one reaching puberty and discovering themselves, it's all a sin according to their father and for them not displaying their innocence and purity, they are punished and forced to wear a white ribbon to remind them at all times that they must be pure and innocent.<br /><br />The doctor who is well-respected in the village is obviously the person that is well-educated and as much as he is seen as a caring individual, in truth, he is demeaning and all that he has in his mind is sex.  He uses his employee, the mid-wife as his sexual toy (even though he detests her) and his parenting as a father of a teenage daughter and young son is not so close.  If anything, his preoccupation of sex is disturbing as we see him showing interest in his daughter.<br /><br />The narrator, the teacher, is possibly the main shining light of the film.  The narrator tells his story of when he was a 31-year-old man who has fallen for the Baroness' nanny who tries to be there for the children and the viewer literally sees the story through his eyes.<br /><br />Through this character, we see that he is just a normal man who enjoys teaching children and has no true connection to the village other than living there and teaching the children.  The narration takes us out of those tense moments as he is focused on wanting to marry a young woman.<br /><br />But the character is instrumental as giving the viewer information on what has taken place at the village but also his scenes is that breather to take us away from those tense moments that happen throughout the film.  The story is told to us via his viewpoint and for the most part, a man who tries to see the good in people and has blinded him of what has been happening in the village.<br /><br />And with these characters, one is left thinking...is this breakdown of idealism is what leads to radical thoughts.  Ignorance, apathy, pessimism...  Have the children of this village became amoral to anyone's suffering?  Is this their form of rebelling?  There is no doubt that \\"The White Ribbon\\" is one of those films that will make one think.<br /><br />The ensemble cast performances is what I found most impressive of \\"The White Ribbon\\".  Burghart Klau&szlig;ner as the pastor is another well-done performance (since I last seen him on \\"The Edukators\\") by the actor, Christian Friedel does a good job at playing the teacher and making us feel that maybe not all people in the village are messed up and the more I think about the film, I can literally list several names that caught my attention but I have to admit that the performances by the pastor's elder children Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) and Martin (Leonard Proxauf) literally haunt you.<br /><br />Klara definitely embodies mischief while Martin is a boy who is at his breaking point, always being punished and doesn't know if he wants to be part of this life and wonders if God hates him and wants him to die.  Again, there are so many well-done performances in this film, it's well-cast and each character from the adults and the children really make us feel the pain that lingers around the village.<br /><br />I've read how people perceived the film about fascism.  Some viewers who felt that this was a film that is about how children became insensitive towards humanity and thus led to their roles in Nazi Germany. Director Michael Haneke said it best when he described the film as children following the idealism of their parent's generation but followed it blindly.  That when you follow idealism blindly, they become inhuman and that this is the root of every form of terrorism.  Haneke wanted to show the breakdown of idealism and that this film could be shot in the UK, US or anywhere around the world and that blind idealism gone astray can happen anywhere and its happening now.<br /><br />But there is no doubt that with the film shot in Germany, at the way their time period exists around the time Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo which eventually would lead to World War I in 1914 and that possibly, how these children were raised made them quite amoral in attitudes towards the death of others and their support for the Nazi regime.  But I do understand Haneke's explanation that the breakdown of idealism is not limited to Germany, this is something that can happen anywhere around the world.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The White Ribbon\\" is one of those films that viewers may find to bleak and also may come out feeling no closure or happy ending.  The fact is that if you are familiar with Haneke's films, you shouldn't be expecting a happy ending.  And as far as bleakness is concerned, this is what Haneke is a master of.  Knowing how to take repress, oppressed characters and showing how they can be inspired to do violent acts.<br /><br />There is no doubt about it.  This is a chilling film but it is also a well-written, well-shot and well-performed, for the most part,  \\"The White Ribbon\\" is definitely a Michael Haneke masterpiece.  The Blu-ray release comes with plenty of special features, especially those who want to know more about Haneke's approach to film and his previous works.  This is an impressive Blu-ray release! Overall, \\"The White Ribbon\\" is highly recommended!innocent.    The doctor who is well-respected in the village is obviously the person that is well-educated and as much as he is seen as a caring individual, in truth, he is demeaning and all that he has in his mind is sex.  He uses his employee, the mid-wife as his sexual toy (even though he detests her) and his parenting as a father of a teenage daughter and young son is not so close.  If anything, his preoccupation of sex is disturbing as we see him showing interest in his daughter.    The narrator, the teacher, is possibly the main shining light of the film.  The narrator tells his story of when he was a 31-year-old man who has fallen for the Baroness' nanny who tries to be there for the children and the viewer literally sees the story through his eyes.    Through this character, we see that he is just a normal man who enjoys teaching children and has no true connection to the village other than living there and teaching the children.  The narration takes us out of those tense moments as he is focused on wanting to marry a young woman.    But the character is instrumental as giving the viewer information on what has taken place at the village but also his scenes is that breather to take us away from those tense moments that happen throughout the film.

0307386171|5.0|After his brilliant novel [[ASIN:0307387151 Atonement]](that not even a horrible movie based on it manged to destroy), I was weary of reading anything else by Ian McEwan. You never know if a writer is one of those people who manage to create one great work of literature and then keep trying to feed on its fame. Still, I decided to risk being disappointed with McEwan's On Chesil Beach. It turned out to be one of the best reading decisions I could have made.<br /><br />On Chesil Beach is a fantastic novel. It tells the story of two newlyweds who, on their wedding day in the summer of 1962, are preparing to have sex for the first time in both of their lives. Neither of them knows what sex is like, they are both scared, and the bride finds the idea of having sex with the groom extremely disgusting, in spite of thinking that she \\"loves\\" him. The couple's lack of knowledge about sex turns their wedding night into an unmitigated disaster.<br /><br />If it seems surprising to you that in 1962, of all times, anybody would be naive enough to mistake something like this for love and even want to get married on the basis of such an evident lack of physical desire, think about how many people buy into the religious propaganda of abstinence before marriage. Imagine how many people - even today - are going through the following self-torture for the sake of some vaguely defined social requirements: \\"They whispered their 'I love yous.' It soothed her to be invoking, however quietly, the unfading formula that bound them, and that surely proved their interests were identical. She wondered if perhaps she might even make it through, and be strong enough to pretend convincingly, and on later, successive occasions whittle her anxieties away through sheer familiarity, until she could honestly find and give pleasure.\\"<br /><br />It becomes clear soon enough that where desire is lacking, there can be no love. The struggle to understand the other person, resolve problems, forgive, try to figure things out is fruitless if people do not experience a powerful physical attraction to each other. If this kind of desire is lacking, the motivation to keep trying is just as big as the one a person would have with a neighbor or a simple acquaintance. As a result, Florence and Edward discover that their relationship dies a painful but a very fast death in the first few hours of their marriage.<br /><br />I believe that any sex ed in high schools should begin by an obligatory reading of On Chesil Beach. There are so many people even today who mess up their lives completely because they mistake simple friendship for love and try to force a romantic, physical relationship where there is no foundation for it in actual physical desire. There are many people who, like Florence, force themselves to suffer through sexual acts with people they find repulsive for the sake of this castrated definition of love.<br /><br />As hilarious as this book is, it also raises some very important issues. On Chesil Beach is one of the most insightful things I have read in a long time about the crippling nature of the puritanical understanding of love.less if people do not experience a powerful physical attraction to each other.

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|\\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\", the film adaptation from the jukebox musical by British playwright Catherine Johnson and featuring the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus (both the male members of the group).  In 1999, the musical has brought in over $2.0 billion in earnings (becoming the highest grossing musical of all time)and what better than to have a film adaptation a decade later.<br /><br />With Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson producing the film, \\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" would be directed by British director Phyllida Lloyd and a screenplay by Catherine Johnson.  The film adaptation would feature an all-star cast starring Meryl Streep (\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\", \\"Adaptation\\", \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\"), Pierce Brosnan (James Bond 007 films, \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\"), Colin Firth (\\"The English Patient\\", \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Shakespeare in Love\\"), Stellan Skarsgard (\\"Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End\\", \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\", \\"Dogville), Julie Walters (Harry Potter films, \\"Becoming Jane\\", \\"Billy Elliot) and Christine Baranski (\\"Happy Family\\", \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\", \\"Chicago\\") and a film that would jumpstart the careers of Amanda Seyfried (\\"Mean Girls\\", \\"Veronica Mars\\") and Dominic Cooper (\\"The Duchess\\").<br /><br />The film which cost $52 million would earn over $609 million worldwide in the box office making the film one of the top 50 highest grossing films of all time and the distinction of the highest grossing movie musical in the world.<br /><br />\\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" showcases the music of ABBA and features all main talent taking part in singing of the songs.  Included are:<br /><br />1. \\"I Have A Dream\\" - Sophie<br />2. \\"Honey, Honey\\" - Sophie, Ali, and Lisa<br />3. \\"Money, Money, Money\\" - Donna, Tanya, Rosie, and Greek Chorus<br />4. \\"Mamma Mia\\" - Donna, Sophie, Ali, Lisa, and Greek Chorus<br />5. \\"Chiquitita\\" - Rosie, Tanya, and Donna<br />6. \\"Dancing Queen\\" - Tanya, Rosie, Donna, Greek Chorus, and Company<br />7. \\"Our Last Summer\\" - Harry, Bill, Sam, Sophie, and Donna<br />8. \\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\" - Sky, Sophie, Sky's Bachelor party friends.<br />9. \\"Super Trouper\\" - Donna, Tanya, and Rosie<br />10. \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\\" - Sophie, Donna, Tanya, Rosie, Ali, Lisa and Greek Chorus<br />11. \\"The Name of the Game\\" - Sophie (deleted scene)<br />12. \\"Voulez-Vous \\" - Donna, Sam, Tanya, Rosie, Harry, Bill, Sky, Ali, Lisa, and Pepper<br />13. \\"SOS\\" - Sam, Donna, and Greek Chorus<br />14. \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" - Tanya, Pepper, Guys, and Girls<br />15. \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" - Donna and Sophie<br />16. \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" - Donna<br />17. \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\" - Sam, Donna, and Company<br />18. \\"When All Is Said and Done\\" - Sam, Donna, and Company<br />19. \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" - Rosie, Bill, Tanya, Pepper, and Harry<br />20. \\"Mamma Mia!\\" (Reprise) - Company<br />21. \\"I Have A Dream\\" (Reprise) - Sophie, Westlife and Company<br />22. \\"Dancing Queen\\" (Reprise) - Donna, Rosie, and Tanya<br />23. \\"Waterloo\\" - Donna, Rosie, Tanya, Sam, Bill, Harry, Sky, and Sophie<br />24. \\"Thank You for the Music\\" - Sophie<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" is presented in 1080p High-Definition (Widescreen 2:40:1).  \\"Mama Mia! The Movie\\" is quite interesting presentation.  For one, the film is shot in Greece and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  But there is also an artistic element that cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos brought to the film (Director Phyllida Lloyd goes more into wanting a dramatical effect for the film through experimental shooting during day and night).  From scenes overlooking the ocean at night with the beautiful black and blues, to the shots of the wedding as lights are seen going up to the church area.  Absolute beautiful!<br /><br />But it's also important to note that Zambarloukos went with colors that are high in contrast at times and colors that may seem a bit oversaturated  at times but for the most part, it added to the vibrancy of the film  and looks incredible on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and comes clear from the front and center channels but the film is obviously going to be musically driven and one is not going to hear an aggressive soundtrack.  Music sounds good but not great as the lossless soundtrack is not as immersive as I would have wanted it to be.  I didn't notice the surround or rear channels being utilized throughout the film.  So, it would have been great if the mix would have incorporated those channels.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  *<br />  * The Making of Mamma Mia! - (24:05) Featuring three features on the making of the film: Birthing Mamma Mia!, The Filmmaking and The Cast.<br />  * Deleted Musical Number - \\"The Name of the Game\\" - (2:57) The deleted musical scene featuring Amanda Seyfried and Stellan Skarsgard's character.<br />  * Anatomy of a Musical Number - \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\" - (5:42) The making of \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\" and Dominic Cooper who is not a singer talks about his experience recording the song and shooting the scene near the beach.<br />  * Becoming a Singer - (10:55) Benny Anderson (of ABBA) talks about wanting to bring the musicians together in making the music for the film.  Anderson and Ulvaeus talk about working with the talent and the talents talk about their experience working with the ABBA stars for the film and footage of the recordings of the music at the studio.  The male talent who are not known for singing talk about being worried in recording the music.<br />  * A Look Inside Mamma Mia! The Movie - (2:39) The cast talk about Abba's music and a look at the musical and the film adaptation.<br />  * Sing-Along - While watching \\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\", you can watch it with a sing-along.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (8:06) The deleted scenes from the film.<br />  * Outtakes - (1:33) The outtakes from the film.<br />  * \\"Gimme! Gimme!

The Movie\\" since \\"Grease\\".  I absolutely felt that Amanda Seyfried shined throughout this film.  Seyfried is absolutely radiant in this fim and since the theatrical release of \\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\", I have been quite impressed by her work.  She's an amazing actress with so much depth and she shows what she is capable of in \\"Mamma Mia!\\", definitely far from what we have seen of her in \\"Mean Girls\\" and \\"Veronica Mars\\".<br /><br />And Meryl Streep, what a brilliant performance.  It's one thing for Streep to be known as a wonderful award winning actress but somehow there was this synergy that went through the cast and but especially for Meryl Streep, she was electrifying and had so much energy, I was impressed.<br /><br />The cast was absolutely fun to watch and although some of the talent (specifically the male talent) are not known for singing, I suppose the film brought this naturalness to its characters.<br /><br />But it all comes down to the music of ABBA, especially if you enjoyed their music in the past.  For me, it was nostalgic as I grew up during the '70s and my parents were part of those disco years and part of my younger life was at home with plenty of people taking part in these disco parties.  So, the music of ABBA didn't bother me and in some ways, some songs really got me interested in how the original music sounds compared to the movie musical and songs such as \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\\" surprised me because I thought the music was first created for Madonna's 2005 song \\"Hung Up\\".<br /><br />But there is so many things that came together for this film that I absolutely enjoyed.  The location was absolutely beautiful, the editing that helped enhance the musical numbers were well-done and as mentioned, the talents were just enjoyable to watch.  This was an enjoyable film that didn't require any seriousness or surrealistic plot, this was a straight-forward fun, vibrant film with an enjoyable cast.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, there are people who enjoy musicals and I know the music of ABBA and disco may be a bit much for some people expecting something along a similar path of movie musicals such as \\"Moulin Rouge\\", \\"Chicago\\" or \\"Nine\\" but \\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" is a film about having fun and being in love, and I suppose once can say that ABBA's music embodies that.  This is a gorgeous movie on Blu-ray and some may feel the film was too oversaturated for their taste but I felt that there was a sense of artistry in terms of cinematography.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\" is a wonderful musical on Blu-ray and if you are into musicals, especially the music of ABBA and want something more lively and fun, definitely give this Blu-ray release a try!

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I truly love this album. I listened to this album over a months time straight. EVERY SONG IS A CLASSIC. People complain that there isn't any good music nowadays. Stop looking at the tv and radio because those songs are played with that \\"under the table money\\", while albums like this get very little airplay. PLEASE SUPPORT THE REALNESS. That is all. Wish I had more stars to give though.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|Like it's title, Splice has elements of many science fiction horror stories: Frankenstein, The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Fly & Species. Two genetic scientists played by likable leads Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley play with fire and create an animal/human hybrid, but are unprepared for the consequences wrought by the female creature born of their lapse in ethics.<br /><br />It won't end well.<br /><br />  Very much in the Cronenberg venereal horror mold, this movie likes to push shock buttons by combining weird science, sex and horror. It's certainly not for everyone, and some will be offended, but those who have a taste for such things will be rewarded by it's bold and perverse choices.<br /><br />  Splice is not without some flaws. Neither lead characters is very sympathetic and one doesn't quite buy them as scientists - the actual science seems glossed over and simplified. There are lapses in plausibility, especially regarding the ability to keep their creation hidden within the lab where they work. The writing is somewhat uneven: underwritten is some places and overwrought in others. On the whole, it feels somewhat rushed.<br /><br />  But Splice has so much going for it - it's strange themes of science versus human compulsion and dysfunctional parenthood - it's ability to be not just frightening, but provide twists which end up being deeply unsettling - that it's definitely worth the time. For all it's creepy, exploitative shock tactics - at it's heart, Splice is really just a good old-fashioned monster movie.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Bremer, Chalabi and Station Chief 'Charlie' are all there.  They moved de-Ba'athification up by two weeks and Charlie's insurgency aardvarks are foreshadowed to keep the narrative crisp.  The only way to make a more accurate fictional portrayal would have been to work the Valerie Plame Wilson NOC outage into it . . . which would have been awkward for any screenwriter.  I think there's another movie coming out that will cover that aspect of the lamentable legacy.    Matt Damon delivers his usual sterling performance.  'The reasons we go to war always matter' - that's the buried lead.      The movie hits all the 'high' points of Spring 2003 and Damon makes a great drummer.

0446563048|2.0|This book has been widely acclaimed as the latest \\"Great Ideas in Business\\" books. Delivering Happiness is part brief autobiography, part \\"here are my brilliant ideas for how to conceive, start, and run a business\\". Tony has some interesting and different ideas on how to run a business. He is more strongly oriented towards creating a corporate culture than any other business guru. However, I've got a problem with Tony and the book. It's the same I have with most of the gurus - proof and replication. Tony was at the right place at the right time once and pretty much by accident made millions in the process. Out of boredom he joined what was to become Zappos. 10 years later he has made Zappos the largest online store specializing in footwear, with sales over 1 billion dollars per year. But Zappos is always on the verge of failure and is completely dependent on an ongoing 100 million dollar line of credit with their banks (at least this was the case prior to their purchase by Amazon). This tells me that they have less than 100 million in profit. Not a rosy situation for any business. For all of the hype about how brilliant Tony is, he hasn't proved that culture is the key to business success. He has not demonstrated anything except that he was successful at making money by accident one time in his life, and his Zappos isn't it. More disappointing is he discusses the dozens of other companies he helped start, most of which failed, none of which had impressive success. So like most of the other business gurus, he provides no proof of his ideas, and has not been able to replicate his one success. Not someone I would consider a viable role model, leader, or even teacher.  Marc Mintz ACSP, ACHDS, ACTC  President  The MacXperts

B000006NPY|5.0|It seems that whenever people talk about The Smashing Pumpkins, they always get caught up with Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie- and that is understandable. Those two albums are the type of decade-defining material that most bands can only dream of and only a select few can actually produce. Both of those albums, with their assault of heavily layered guitars that became the trademark sound for The Pumpkins, deserve every bit of the praise they get. It's not surprising that they tower high enough to cast a shadow over everything else the Pumpkins would go on to do, but that really is a shame, because Adore is a strong enough album on it's own to stand right alongside those two giants of alternative rock- so why doesn't it in the eyes of so many Pumpkins fans?    Well, perhaps it is because the shadow metaphor, while cliche, fits it so perfectly. Just by glancing at the cover of Adore, you can tell that this is going to be a very different album than it's predecessors. It's dark, but at the same time it is delivered with a much softer touch than either of the records that came before it. It's an album that sounds better when listened to while alone in the dark, when the sound can accentuate every looming shadow, and fill isolation with a sense of familiarity. The atmosphere is as captivating and fulfilling as any album I have ever heard, rivaled only by The Cure's \\"Disintegration,\\" which seems like an obvious influence on this album.    Gone from Adore are the layered guitars, the Pumpkins brand of distortion, and Jimmy Chamberlain. Added is a very strong sense of atmosphere, lyrics that go much deeper than the surface angst that was employed on much of Mellon Collie, and a Drum Machine (and don't worry, it doesn't sound very out of place here.) Still remaining? Billy Corgan's unique vocals, which sound better here than ever, and that grand, almost pretentious feeling of an epic scope that the Pumpkins seem to nail down effortlessly with each release. While the moods and sound may have shifted to new territory, the band delivering this music is still very obviously The Smashing Pumpkins.     The change, however, was enough to alienate a large number of Smashing Pumpkins fans. Adore sold quite poorly when compared with other Pumpkins albums, and a quick trip to any Pumpkins forum can quickly show you that fans of the band can be split into two camps (well, maybe three now, with the current \\"reunion,\\" which I won't go into now)- Those who like everything up to and including Mellon Collie, and those who like everything the Pumpkins did. Adore doesnt really \\"rock\\" at all, with none of the songs really offering the guitar heroism that everyone knows Billy Corgan is capable of. Every song is dark, each delievered with varying degrees of sadness, but in the albums 16 song stretch, the darkness never really gets old or overbearing, due to the eclectic use of styles throughout. \\"Once Upon a Time\\" takes a more folksy approach than anything, while \\"Apples + Oranjes\\" feels like some sort of gothic techno song. \\"Pug\\" is almost industrial like, with Billy reveling in madness and insanity like we have never seen, while \\"To Sheila\\" is a beautiful and romantic acoustic number, which makes you feel like you are in love, even if you clearly aren't. Which brings me to my next point- on Adore, it feels like the band is in complete control of the user's emotions. It is that personal and affecting. Much of the songwriting is Billy lamenting on the deaths of those close to him. \\"For Martha,\\" the token epic 7 minute plus track found on every Pumpkins release, is obviously about Billy's mother passing away, and Tear, an album highlight, is supposedly about an ex-girlfriend of Billy's who died in a car crash.    While every song is worth mentioning in some way, I would rather not go into each one. I'll just say this- this is an album that is meant to be listened to as a whole. It is powerful, beautiful, and sad. It feels like the most sincere offering fromthis band, that has truly earned it's place as one of the best of the 90's. No, there isn't a hit single, like \\"Today\\" or \\"1979\\" (though \\"Ava Adore\\" comes pretty close). No, there isnt a great guitar solo every song. No, Jimmy Chamberlain isn't here to further his claim of being one of the best drummers of modern rock. And no, it doesn't sound like \\"Siamse Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie.\\" But once again, it does sound like the Smashing Pumpkins- and those who can accept the new sound will know the band on a whole new level. Do not let an aversion to change keep you from experiencing this masterpiece.

B0019N8P2W|3.0|I have to say I had looked forward to this release for such a long time. I was an avid fan of Daria when I was in high school, when it originally aired. I eventually found the ripped TV episodes and was satisfied. About 6 years later here we are:<br /><br />I bought this collection not knowing that the music was changed, but that I completely understand. It would have been twice as much, which I would have easily paid, but that's a moot point. What does bother me is that the quality is no different than the ripped from TV episodes. MTV/Viacom did nothing to clean anything up, or offer higher resolution, and probably didn't even use the masters from the looks of it, at least with the early seasons. The only benefit from the TV rips is that they aren't the few censored Noggin ones.<br /><br />The \\"extras\\" are by definition extra, but they aren't any sort of extra premium content one would expect.<br /><br />(This section contains Fair Use Doctrine) My biggest qualm is how the DVD tracks are put together. Since I paid for this DVD and expected to move it to my hard drive (for my own personal use), I was sorely disappointed with how Viacom wants to treat me like a criminal. Instead of a single track containing a single episode, the track includes 3-5 minutes of a few episodes, making it impossible to extract a complete episode. I was left with 22 minutes of an amalgam of 4 episodes. This gives me little incentive to stop watching my TV rips, which may sound lazy, but convenience wins when they are both of the same quality, and the TV ones also the include original music. So as to not confuse anyone, the DVDs play an episode completely, it doesn't mix anything up.<br /><br />The presentation is sub-par, but for people who don't have access to the episodes, this will satisfy your Daria craving.

B002SQ364Q|5.0|I happened to recently find this movie on my On Demand cable service.  I had not ever heard of it.<br /><br />I'm a HUGE fan of 1969 WOODSTOCK, (have Collector's Edition of DVD).  I have always felt I was born in the wrong era--I should have been there!  (To me, there is really only ONE REAL Woodstock.)<br /><br />I knew some of the facts in the movie Taking Woodstock, but it was AWESOME to see it put together and done so WELL!<br /><br />I love the portrayal of Elliot, whom I perceived as the main character.  I saw this as also a \\"coming of age\\" film, from his point of view.  He was amazingly brilliant at such a young age and to make such excellent \\"business/promotion\\" decisions that had to be made under pressure.<br /><br />It is *totally* a \\"feel good\\" movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would love to own the DVD!<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!<br /><br />In my opinion, the best review here on Amazon about the movie is by James Lossing (it should be the top review) so be sure to read it!

1594488843|1.0|As has been expressed by other reviewers, the author fails to create a substantive basis for his book.  The examples in part one are weak; there is nothing new here whatsoever, except some of Mr. Pink's invented words.  Indeed, he is a terribly informal writer; one actually feels dumber after reading this book.  Have something on hand to cleanse your intellectual and literary palate.  The liberal overtones throughout are an additional turnoff, and the author's very apparent lack of knowledge when it comes to management is an insult to the audience.

The characters are not as funny or likable as on tv but the book is a fun read.  The reviews on the book cover continue the premise that Castle is a real mystery writer using James Patterson and Stephen J. Cannell to give reality to the author.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I bought this book because there were so many favorable reviews. I, however, disagree with the praise. It was so bad that I wanted to stop reading it but I can't do that with any book, except maybe James Patterson's when he \\"co-authors\\". It finally got interesting enough to read after getting about half of the way through it. So, the second half of the book was okay but I won't read the next two books in his series. Why waste reading time on a book that isn't good cover to cover?<br />I read that the author was comparable to Michael Connelly. Don't believe it. Michael Connelly is superb! He's one of my favorite writers. Even comparing Larsson to another new author, John Hart, he still falls short. If you want to read new authors, try John Hart, especially The Last Child. I think that was his third but the first two were good, also.

But in the series questions do get answered quickly unlike other popular dramas where things never get answered. My family all watches this together and we are all completely obsessed. The acting is amazing and so is the diversity of characters. There are many stories being told in the series but there are no characters that the show never gets back or or that are ignored. Amazing t.v. show I would recommend it to anyone!
006145205X|5.0|Matt Ridley's masterful book is utterly convincing when he identifies free enterprise and open markets as the driving force behind human prosperity.  Open markets harness resources and focus human ingenuity to solve vexing problems more quickly and more efficiently than any governmental bureaucracy. In an equally compelling manner he exposes the junk science and mistaken assumptions underpinning public policies advocated by progressive elites.  If you ascribe to progressive social and political thought, this book will cause many sleepless nights --- be prepared to have your world view turned upside down.
1416594787|5.0|Growing up in a small rural town where evolution was considered a four letter word, I really could have used this book years ago. Dawkins is clear about the goal of the book: this is basically an apologetics primer for the rationally inclined. The evidence is straightforward, convincing, and covers a broad spectrum of research. A+ for reaching the book's primary goal.    Although that would clearly have been enough, I was pleasantly surprised at how Dawkins was able to weave a sense of wonder about the natural world into the book. You can tell he is fascinated by the world around him, and it's easy to understand why when you read some of his examples (dancing sifaka for the win!). He does wander off on tangents at times, but the benefits of his occasionally meandering side remarks are more than worth the occasional cost.
0471267554|3.0|I recently joined a fitness movement called CrossFit, and most of the people I've met via the group subscribe to the Paleo Diet as a way of life.      Since I've been hearing so many positive things about how people feel after adopting this way of eating, I wanted to know more about it from a practical standpoint.      Unfortunately, this book did nothing to convince me to completely cut out grains, legumes and dairy from my diet.  Cordain makes huge claims based on \\"studies\\" but seldom gives enough information to follow up on his claims.  There is a bibliography at the end of the book, but nothing is footnoted, forcing the reader to search for whichever study title seems like it might be appropriate.      While it seems logical to limit consumption of these things, as well as sugar, I'd like more real evidence that this will make everything in my life better on a long term basis.  A few anecdotal stories are not convincing enough.     The other huge problem I have with Cordain's claims is two-fold.  First, his claim that exercise doesn't really have much bearing on weight loss -- He indicates that regular exercise simply keeps the weight off, but that diet is the real effective cause of loss of weight.  Logic would indicate that the two together are important both in initial loss and in maintainence.  The second is his section on skin cancer.  Cordain is not a medical doctor, yet he states that a tan protects you from UV rays and that after you build this base, you can reduce your level of sunscreen usage.  We are continually informed from the medical profession that any and all sun exposure is damaging, and while we need the vitamin D from the sun, we must protect ourselves.    In all, like most of the diet and fitness books out there, there are pearls of wisdom here, but there are also unfounded claims.  Like everything else in life, Cordain's statements should be taken in moderation.

0805091742|5.0|Atul Gawande is the author of two of the best books about the modern medical profession, Complications and Better.  He shows himself to be open to examining the weaknesses of doctors as well as the unfair expectations under which doctors often work.  He also seems to be aware of patient needs without losing sight of what is necessary to treat them.  In The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande does something slightly different.  He is focused more on finding answers to the question: what do doctors and nurses need to do to reduce the incidence of mistakes in treatment?  And the answer is: use a checklist.<br /><br />Using a checklist seems like such a simple answer to what is a very complicated problem.  There are so many ways that mistakes can happen in medical treatment: hands aren't washed and cause an infection, something that is supposed to be monitored is missed, a drug dosage is inadvertently too high or low, and on and on.  How much can a simple checklist help in such a complicated and often high stakes and quickly unfolding situation?  A lot, it turns out.<br /><br />Gawande starts by examining two other high stakes professions where checklists have made a huge difference: airline pilot and building engineer.  He discusses how Boeing made checklists part of the routine for their pilots after WWII when their aircraft became sufficiently complicated to overwhelm even experienced pilots.  Since then, the checklist has become an indispensible part of flying in the US, covering an incredible number of possible situations and constantly being updated as new possibilities arise.  He also takes us inside the construction site of a typical skyscraper and shows the seemingly endless checklists used to keep a complex building on track.<br /><br />And what proof do we have that these checklists work?  Think about how rare it is in the thousands of flights that take place in the US every day that something goes wrong due to pilot error.  Compare that to non-commercial flights (where checklists are often ignored or non-existent), that are the bulk of accidents in the US.  Or compare to commercial flights in other nations.  (Gawande has an eye-opening examination of Korean Air.)  Now think about the spectacular structures that have been created in modern times that never fall without some catastrophic impact, and compare that to Renaissance cathedrals and towers that were too often subject to toppling over (Leaning Tower of Pisa anyone?).  Checklists work.<br /><br />But Gawande does more than assert that checklists should work for the medical profession.  He puts it to the test.  He becomes part of a project that puts together a checklist and tests it in hospitals worldwide.  He talks about the difficulties and the refinements they have to make to put together something useful.  And yet, the positive results they have are amazing.<br /><br />So, how long will it be before the checklist changes the face of American medicine?  It is difficult to say.  Gawande is quite open about the challenges in getting doctors past egos that make them think they don't need checklists or that outsiders shouldn't tell them what to do in their practice.  But the results, in the end, do speak for themselves.  One can only hope that the science will ultimately trump the system and its personalities.here checklists are often ignored or non-existent), that are the bulk of accidents in the US.

0545123283|4.0|Shiver touched my soul and LINGER reminded me why. The timeless and pure love story between Sam and Grace beats through every page of LINGER. Romantic, tragic, and hopeful in turn. LINGER is the kind of story that, well, lingers with a deliciously bittersweet ache.<br /><br />Maggie breaths life into her characters animating them in such a way that you can sometimes hear the sound of their voices rather then just read their words on a page. One especially vivid new character is Cole, one of the new wolves that Beck made at the end of Shiver. The scenes that resonated most with me were the scenes that Isabel and Cole shared. Both of these characters are broken in their own estimation. Hazardous, even poisonous to others, and so consumed with guilt that its all they can do to breath sometimes.<br /><br />Isabel sees in Cole another broken soul that she can exist with without any demands or expectations. Cole doesn't see much of anything initially. He is consumed with the pursuit of oblivion. Becoming a wolf to him is the drug that deadens life. Maggie explained her thought process behind creating Cole as a character whose \\"contrast to Sam would serve to draw the readers attention to the essential Sam-ness of his character. \\"<br /><br />LINGER, while still beautifully moving and masterfully written, isn't quite as impactful as Shiver. The stakes with Sam and Grace were painfully high in Shiver and every page bleed with the urgent inevitability of Sam's departure (the temperature beginning every chapter almost made me cry as it dropped). In LINGER, the peril of this story doesn't present itself until later and the significance of it doesn't fully register until the final chapters. The split focus on Isabel and Cole as well as Sam and Grace added to that complacency. I loved all the characters in LINGER, but the addition of them drew me away from Sam and Grace.<br /><br />LINGER is an exceptionally written book superior to most every other Paranormal YA novel (Shiver being a big exception). I'm thrilled that the movie rights to Shiver have been sold and can only hope this entire trilogy will find its way to a theater near me in the future. I have mixed emotions about Forever, the final book in this trilogy, releasing in July of 2011. I'm hopeful yet dreading the end for these characters who feel so real that their fates have become almost embarrassingly important to me.

B002N8A14M|1.0|It's true that there are not many options when it comes to a case for the new iPod nano. However, I was extremely disappointed with this case, particularly after reading all of the good reviews. The case is very tight on the iPod, and the plastic lining at the bottom obscures the charger and headphone jack. I could barely fit my tiny headphone plug in the jack and the car transmitter constantly falls out with the slightest movement. The plastic lining at the top makes it nearly impossible to operate the hold switch. The lining around the middle buttons feels awkward and uncomfortable at first, but eventually you get used to it.    I've had the case for about a month and already it's scratched like crazy. Acrylic was not a good choice. I also think the thickness and the design make the nano look dull and unattractive. I can't speak too much for the armband, except that I found it uncomfortable and it slid off of me a lot unless I strapped it so tightly that it blocked my circulation. The only plus is the clip, which is sturdy. Otherwise, it's a thoroughly disappointing product that I intend to replace as soon as someone else makes a case with a clip.
B000001LKY|5.0|I have an important announcement to make- Warrior on the Edge of Time is officially my 2000th review here on amazon.  Talk about a LOT of hard work this has been.  I reviews so many albums and movies (mostly horror movies... mostly bad ones) and so it's an honor to have such an incredible album like this as my 2000th review.  Thank you everyone for reading *tumbleweed blows by*    Anyway, WOW.  It's an absolute crime Warrior on the Edge of Time isn't more popular these days.  It sounds like nothing else out there.  Certainly completely different from everything else taking place in the mid 70's.  Yes this is considered influential space rock, but it's NOT like Pink Floyd or Yes's style of space rock at all.      This is more like a really unique blend of hard rock, punk and flute/sax jamming all throw in the same pot.  And the results are just fantastic the entire way through.  I don't appreciate any Pink Floyd or Yes comparisons because that seems to throw up a big red flag and make people assume Hawkwind is some kind of poor imitation of superior bands- this is most certainly NOT true, trust me.    This feels like the real deal.  Since Hawkwind is an original band who liked to take advantage of so many different styles and blend them together in such an immediately noticeable way, it only makes sense that Warrior on the Edge of Time is in a league of its own.    \\"Assault and Battery-The Golden Void\\" (two songs linked together) creates a multi-part explosion of heavy, mind-changing space rock guitar riffs, intricate flute jams, spectacular and melodic vocal melodies, and I believe those are mellotrons taking place in the background.  Correct me if I'm wrong about that.  This adds up to one truly incredible song.  I absolutely love it to pieces.     Well, the rest of the album is in pretty much the same style (except maybe even *heavier* in other spots) but that doesn't mean you get tired of the bands style, or that the music becomes terribly repetitive or anythinglike that.  The entire experience is refreshing.      The production sounds amazing, the quality of the songwriting is at an all-time high for the band, and this my friends, is just a perfect album.

B000AE8FZS|5.0|First of all ladies and gentlemen (I mean gentlemen, hehe) why in the freakin' WORLD would Gentle Giant give one of their albums such a boring name like \\"In'terview?\\"  That's like, the worst name ever.  It's ordinary, plain and just boring.   Seriously guys.  Not cool!  A word like that reminds me of wet newspaper sitting outside the Wall Street building when the Dow Jones is down 200 points.     It's a slap in my personal face because Gentle Giant offers their fans so much creativity from their music that such a boring name like \\"interview\\" simply doesn't belong in that amazing little world they created for themselves, and do NOT tell me a pretty rainbow on the album cover makes up for it either.  I will have none of that.  Nope, it doesn't cut the mustard.  It is pretty lookin', though!  I have been known to be a really big fan of rainbows.  A fully developed rainbow guides my personal journey to greater heights.  A *double* fully developed rainbow... well that's just unheard of!       Anyway, boring album name aside, there's definitely a solid album underneath that bad name (and I'm trying not to gag right at this very moment as a skunk just sprayed its magic outside my computer room window.  I'm not kidding either- it's really close, and it stinks bad).  I can still concentrate on writing a review.  Just let me squeeze my nostrils shut with a clothespin.     The title song jump starts my world on an amazingly high note.  That herky jerky rhythm section!  That offbeat vocal melody!  The fun never ends.  You know what?  I wonder what the parents of the band members were thinking about the music of Gentle Giant while it was being created?        They must have been thinking \\"Geez, our kids are so messed up.  We did everything in our power to bring them up the right way too.  The world is doomed, DOOMED I tell ya!\\"  Little did their parents know Gentle Giant had a talent to stand apart from the rest.  Someone should have dropped them a hint.     Well it's time to explore a tropical island so kick your wifes shoes out of the closet and grab that bag of Hawaiian gear you've been meaning to show off.  It's time to use it.  Wanna know why?  Because the fruity rhythm and beats of \\"Give It Back\\" will take your exotic mind either to Hawaii or somewhere in the Central American Islands.  I actually think about Wheel of Fortune and specifically the glamorous tropical island trips that contestants can win when I hear a song like \\"Give It Back\\".  This is one cool song, too.  Ah, Hawaiian girls.  So full of welcoming smiles, and so willing to please arrivers all the time... and they always seem so shy because they never say anything!  They just stand there and put wreaths around your neck.   Is it any wonder why people (mostly men) dream of Hawaii so much?     \\"Design\\" takes us back to the crazily placed vocals from \\"On Reflection\\" with *another* attempt at the same kind of thingy!  It works too.      Well, it doesn't work *quite* as well this time around perhaps because the vocals in the intro never develop into something mind-boggling terrific, which means \\"On Reflection\\" still remains a brilliant slice of heaven in comparison.  Your heaven is comprised of finally meeting your dearly departed relatives.  Mine is made up of Gentle Giant material.  We clearly came from two separate Gods.     \\"Another Show\\" is... just another show.  Go home folks, show's over!  Actually the show *is* just about over since Interview (God I hate saying that word, and nothing will change my mind about it either) is the last good album Gentle Giant ever made.   Anyway, this song is constructed in a really weird way.  It has what definitely sounds like extremely messy futuristic musical ideas (performed rather sloppily might I add- but I prefer using the word \\"sloppily\\" instead of \\"messy\\" the second time around since I'm trying to expand my limited vocabulary).        \\"Empty City\\" has some nice guitar playing in the intro.  Then it calmly drifts (like a poisonous jellyfish-infested pacific ocean current) into the vocals.  This is a nice vocal melody, but if you think I'm supposed to be blown away by it, sit up young man, pay attention, and guess again.  It's still pretty dang cool, though.  The final minute of instrumental playing sounds like robots on steroids.  Talk about bizarre.  If only this song was popular in America, the disco movement could have been destroyed before it officially got underway!  Destroyed by robots!     What's hilarious about \\"Timing\\" is... the actual timing!  The moment the violin just APPEARS out of nowhere when the vocal melody suddenly stops definitely feels awkward in a \\"We're still rehearsing!  Don't lay this down on tape yet, you fool!\\" kind of way.  That's a weird moment, but enjoyable all the same.  It happens again later on, but it doesn't become any easier to accept just because it makes a second appearance.  Gentle Giant seems to think so, though.  Well I have news for THEM... actually it grows on me with repeated listens.  No, it doesn't grow on me like cancer or poison ivy- more like a fresh morning flower or a fun-loving puppy.       Oh yes!  OH YEAH!  My favorite song concludes this magnificent album.  \\"I Lost My Head\\" is a *brilliant* song.  That vocal melody starts off so silly and dim-witted before eventually drifing into a heavy rock, funky section.  BOTH sections blow my dumb face off my big hot head.  This is definitive proof that Gentle Giant are not only intelligent musicians, but capable of being adventurous in a way that completely goes over most peoples heads.       The line \\"I can't remember what I said, I lost my head\\" are lyrics I can relate to VERY easily these days.  I have indeed lost my head.  Really!  It happened about 5 years ago.  Something went wrong when my body went through another change.  Supposedly your body changes every 7 years... or rather, it goes through 5 major changes over the course of ones life.  I felt that specific change alright!  Like an airconditioner falling on my head from an upper level apartment building.  The biggest change yet.  I hope the one I experience when I turn 60 isn't as big.       Well, the lead singer might not remember anything anymore (darn amnesia!) but we'll all help him remember the good ol' days when Gentle Giant stood apart from everyone else.  Stood out with authority!  A solid album Interview is... but if you happen to come down with a slight case of amnesia when it comes to remembering the title of the album, consider yourself one lucky duck!  That's right, I won't let that go!

B003RHCS2Q|1.0|I made the foolish mistake of believing that because the other Stargate franchises had been excellent, Universe would continue to carry the torch. I could not have been more wrong. Thoroughly dislikable characters, predictable scripts and sub standard acting made me switch off after the first 3 episodes. My sympathies to Robert Carlyle, who was clearly mislead into taking on this project.    The story of \\"Air\\" I found to be a poorly executed setup, with many important ideas and plots lines clumsily introduced and not sufficiently elaborated or developed to generate real interest. Also, the character Eli was particular aggravating for me. Really, as if the US Airforce would invite an unknown chubby kid to be an integral part of mankind's most important mission! The premise was ridiculous from the start and I can only assume that this was some kind of spiteful attempt to appeal to the stereotype \\"computer nerd\\" contingent of fans that the producers seem to be trying so hard to sell this program to.    Save yourself the disappointment and watch the Original series over again instead.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I don't own any devo albums but am a child of the 80s.  I got this album a couple days ago and have ran through the songs on the car cd player 4 or 5 times.  This is great music.  Thanks Devo for bringing it back!  Its fun to drive to although I find myself speeding and passing cars while listening to it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|If you're a fan of the show, you will undoubtedly enjoy this book.  It's basically an episode in book format.  Ithad the same tone and feel of the show and although I don't so much enjoy reading mysteries (which makes little sense since I love watching them in TV and movie format) I was surprised to like this book so much.  It was a bit disconcerting, though, after a period of being sucked into the book and seeing it in your head with the characters from the show, to be taken aback when a character name or bit of backstory is mentioned that is different from the show.  You sit there thinking \\"who's Jameson again?\\" before you remember \\"Oh yeah, that's code for Rick.\\"  Overall I had a fun time with this story.
031606792X|5.0|I've noticed that many others have expressed disappointment and even disgust with the final book in the Twilight Sage series.  I was afraid to even read the book for fear that it would ruin the series for me.  Yes, the things that happen in the book are far from anything that could happen in reality but isn't that the point of a story about Vampires and Werewolves?  This story is pure fantasy and the beauty of that is that anything can happen.  I personally enjoyed this book immensely and in fact am re-reading it.  I cannot wait to see how this book is adapted to screen.  It should be very interesting!
B0011HOEY4|5.0|This is a very good DVD and was an excellent buy, and the shipping was great.
0743454537|3.0|I read this book at the recommendation of many people who told me this book would both make me bawl and give me hours of thoughtful debate.    I'll give the book credit. It makes you think. The whole issue is a giant moral dilemma. Unfortunately, I never really felt anything for these characters who were supposed to be all sympathetic. A dying sister, ex lovers, a troubled 13 year old donor, a mother forced to decide between children. All of those characters should have been breaking my heart without breaking a sweat. Amazingly enough, the only sympathetic character for me was Jesse, the overlooked forgotten child turned pyromaniac. I read each of their plights, felt bad for their situation but never connected with any of them.    This is one of those Harry Potter-esque books in my eyes. It's a great book if you're not an avid reader. If you read it, at least you're reading something decent. For the people (like myself) who go through multiple books a week for pleasure though, this was a bit of a letdown.      For non-readers: 5/5  For people like me: 3/5

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|The ubiquitous \\"inner city gangbanger\\" doesn't exist as such.  I grant you the concept is real in the sense of being a solid idea that describes a particular phenomena.  However, once investigated, this immediately falls apart.  It doesn't stand up to direct personal experience the same way most categorizations do not.  By the way, great movie.  Please enjoy:-)
B003IMER3I|1.0|DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY DVD IF YOU'RE EXPECTING TO WATCH THE LOST SEGMENT OF THE FILM THAT WAS FOUND IN SOUTH AMERICA AND ADDS MORE THAN 20 MINUTES TO THE FILM! IT'S SCHEDULED FOR RELEASE IN NOVEMBER 2010 BY ANOTHER DVD COMPANY. THIS DVD WAS CONVENIENTLY RELEASED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE IT. IF YOU ARE HAPPY WITH THE SAME OLD 2 HOUR DVD AND WANT A SHORTER VERSION THEN BUY IT. OTHERWISE KEEP YOUR MONEY FOR THE NOVEMBER RELEASE OF METROPOLIS WITH THE LOST SEGMENTS. IT'LL MAKE A GREAT XMAS GIFT.
B000HBK3MM|2.0|This mellifluous (but glib) collection is completely narcissistic. It creates a mood ideal for indulging one's narcissism. Needless to say, we all need to do this from time to time. If you want music to help you feel, here's one that works. If you can feel something on your own, get something else. This one won't make you uncomfortable by urging you to think.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|This was very good. It wasn't clear at the beginning where the plot would go. The ending was very surprising despite being very plausible. This was a nice surprise considering most SYFY have common plots. It is NOT a shoot-um-up show. It did keep me interested and was thought provoking. Bottom line I don't resent the money I spent, or the time spent watching it. I do recommend it for seasoned SYFY watchers.
B002NUULNG|4.0|Ah, Ghost In The Shell. One of the defining pieces of anime ever to exist, this is typically one of the films you hear mentioned when someone starts a sentence with \\"I never was really into anime, but then I saw...\\" Based on a fantastic manga, the film is a landmark for both the depth of the story and the quality of the animation.<br /><br />The Blu version is as pretty as you'd expect, clear and full of detail. The sound is also exceptional, but seeing as this is a classic it's no surprise they got this right. What's a bit of a shock is how badly the new content fits into the overall picture.<br /><br />For those who don't know, some of the previously non-CG scenes have been 'updated' with all CG scenes. I guess this is really a matter of personal preference, but to my eyes it's a downgrade. The CG isn't good enough to replace the original animation, and as mentioned in other reviews the change is quite jarring. My biggest gripe is when the Major comes up to the ocean surface early in the film. In the original, there's a lingering close shot of her staring at the sky, and the shot reverses so you see she's just watching the clouds go by. It's a quiet moment that gets expanded on shortly after, but the new CG omits the close and reverse shot and just shows her floating. Worst of all, her eyes are obscured by glare and to me something gets lost. Again, maybe that's just me. I also miss the original credits, but the new ones are fine too. The change of color tone didn't affect anything for me, purists may disagree.<br /><br />Honestly, the small updates to certain scenes don't spoil one of the finest entries anime has to offer. This is still a fantastic film that should be seen by any animation fans.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Hailing from Detriot Michigan Eminem has rapped about his constant conflicts with his ex-wife, drug abusing mother, his everlasting love for his daughter Hailey, and even his own dabbling with drug use as well.  Recovery was a different approach on his musical career that he has not yet done yet.  Some people (judging by the critics who gave this cd a 3 Star or below) do not have the musical intellect or passion for the endless possibilities and directions that music can go.  Eminem definately showed us all this with Recovery.  Stepping out of his comfort zone and dropping the pure fire that all of his fans have loved for years.  I have to say that I did not however care for his Encore album as much as his others, but this is the addition to the top of the list of Eminem's greatest.  With songs like \\"Space Bound\\", Eminem touches on the \\"love\\" he has felt and the desperation that comes with it when it does not work out.  Catchiest chorus on the entire cd and WILL be featured on his \\"Greatest Hits\\" someday when a new one is demanded.  My only complaint that I did not care for was his collaboration with Lil Wayne and his \\"Shout Out\\" to Lil Wayne and Kanye West.  Anyone that is too big of \\"LOSER\\" to jump onstage and tell another artist (that is clearly better than him) that they don't deserve an award, is immediately on the \\"Bottom of my List\\" and does not deserve props for his \\"lack of character\\", but thats a another whole arguement in itself.
0451197879|4.0|I suppose one can be pushed so far until the breaking point is reached. Barton Dawes is such a man who reached that point in 1974.<br />The novel is a mainstream Richard Bachman work. There's no supernatural, occult, or ghosts in it. Only a man teetering on the edge of sanity.<br />Mr. Dawes hasn't gotten over the untimely death of his young son. The government is taking his place of business & his house through eminent domain to build a freeway extension. Other of life's problems add to his shaky psyche. The only comfort he finds is in Southern Comfort.<br />The book is a serious departure for King. It may be one of his lesser known works. There are better King novels. But, don't pass on this one by any means. It has Bachman written all over it and that's not a bad thing at all
B001HN69AE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! I'm sorry so many people seemed to hate it. I've seen many (of the seemingly thousands!) of Dragonball episodes and movies over the years, and I really liked the way they created this live version. They made some small changes to the story and some characters that I'm familiar with, but I thought the changes made sense in putting together a 90-minute movie. I especially like the change they made to Chi Chi. She's now extremely cute and not at all the screeching banshee that she mostly is in the cartoon series. I thought the casting was great all around, and even though Chow Yun-fat looks nothing like Master Roshi from the cartoon, it's Chow Yun-fat for cryin' out loud! He gets to play whatever part he wants! Emmy Rossum as Bulma!? Perfect! I've forgotten the name of the actor who plays Piccollo, but again, perfect! Anyway, I'm enjoying writing this goofy review in the same way I enjoyed watching this and pretty much every Dragonball episode I've seen. Its a very simple story, lots of great action and just a fun time all around. I thought the special effects and the look of the film were great and I'm really sorry that they most likely won't be doing a series of Dragonball films. I would have loved to see Vegeta throwing down. That would have been a blast! Or Frieza! Who's up for some world-shattering combat?!!<br /><br />Ahem. Anyway, to get a hold of my inner child for a moment, This is just a really fun film. They did a good job of bringing the characters and feel of Dragonball to life and I really hope to see all these actors reprise their roles in many more Dragonball films. Come on! Make it happen!<br /><br />Oh yeah, the picture and audio on this blu-ray are excellent, the special features are slim and you get a digital copy. I say, at 15 bucks or less, buy it!

I'm excited to read Linger - already available on my Kindle!
B001NFNFNU|5.0|The year 2008 was a year where he OSCARS where a FIASCO. Movies like this one that should've gotten OSCARS(Angelina was nominated as Best female actress and didnt get an Oscar - what a shame!)were treated by the wayside.<br /><br />The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button suffered the same fate. That was the best movie of that year and like Forrest Gump it shouldve cleaned house. Brad Pitt on this movie was also nominated for Best Actor but was given to Sean Pean for a movie called MILK that you can find now at Walmart for $5. I guess they wanted to get in good with the Gay community at the Oscars because MILK cant touch Benjamin Button.<br /><br />To the surprise of many, this was a great movie directed by Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />PLOT - This movie takes place in the 20s. Angelina is a phone operator supervisor and leaves her son at home as she goes to work. When she returns she cant find him anywhere so she files a police report and tries for the police to help her but at that time, the police didnt want to look bad so they put her in a psychiatric ward because she made public that the police failed to help her finding her son.<br /><br />It narrows down that a man in the 30s killed 19 kids and one of the kids that escaped came forward to tell the tale. The kid mentioned he saw Angelina's son as this man massacred kids sometimes 5 at a time.<br /><br />With the help of an attorney, Angelina files a lawsuit against the police dept and not only the killer was sentenced to die by hanging but unfortunately Angelina was never able to recover from the loss of her son.<br /><br />Is a great movie with a lot of substance that again it was treated by the wayside!!!

1439138311|2.0|This story was duller than dull.  There really was no story line of any interest and the characters were paper-thin.  Nothing much happens that has any reality or credibility to it.  I felt I wasted my time on this book.
0525423842|5.0|I am a big Grisham fan. When I learned of his new endeavor of writing a book for older children I wanted to read it. I was not disappointed. I fell in love with Theodore Boone and can't wait for the next installment.  Now it wasn't the gripping legal thriller that he writes for adults but this is not an adult book. I think kids will get hooked and want to read more about Theo. I'm sure many adults will enjoy this also.
B00095NX9G|4.0|This pains me - I seriously wish I could give this dvd 5 stars - it certainly deserves it for the content, and all the evaluations by the other posters are spot on. It is a tremendous instructional tool and exactly what we have been waiting for from Rachel. I just can't get past the music for the choreography, especially the first one. Everyone else seems to have described it as \\"fun and peppy, upbeat\\" or some such corresponding adjective, but I find it annoying, ridiculous and distracting (I will also throw in goofy and dorky as that is honestly how it sounds to me.)Thankfully, all the drills and wonderful instruction on Disc 1 are accompanied by something more traditional. But I was so sad to get to the choreography section - I find it odd and disconcerting to see bellydance done to something that sounds like circus music. Actually, it sounds more like a polka with the tuba and all (Yes, you guys, I am aware it is Hungarian or someone even said Balkan, but, whatever). While I appreciate the \\"artistry\\" of the musicians, and I understand that there is much personal interpretation and artistic license taken by each dancer, particularly in Fusion (which is what the word \\"Fusion\\" implies)I personally find it very inappropriate and I was longing to watch and learn combos from Rachel with a little more traditional ME sound and feel that I came to bellydance for in the first place. (As far as I know, Ive been trying to learn bellydance not the polka.) Oh well, I know it is just my one lone, personal sentiment. But I truly am disappointed to have to try to learn the choreography with the sound turned off (I REALLY hate it that much) and trying to apply it to some of my other music. Would it have been so hard to do a choreography that was a little more \\"across the board\\"?    Now that I have that off my chest I would just like to say that, sans the aforementioned music - Rachel was fabulous, glorious, fantastic, incredible and really gave tremendous instruction and insight into achieving that \\"style\\" of hers that we all love so much. I will always be a Rachel fan so don't flog me too much when you read this.

0739404911|4.0|A Walk to Remember is probably one of Nicholas Sparks' greatest love stories - and if you're a fan of his work, you know that Sparks is not short on love stories. Though I am a huge fan of his writing, I sometimes feel that many of his books follow similar storyline structures and are sometimes predictable. However, this book is by far an exception! Right from the beginning, you are brought into Landon Carter's world of success and popularity and Jamie Sullivan's world as somewhat of a social outcast. Yet circumstances beyond their control bring them together and, soon after, they find themselves falling in love - certainly an unlikely romance. Okay, so I guess that sounds like a typical Nicholas Sparks' story, but I promise you this one will stand out above all others. The two teenagers, Landon and Jamie, are a perfect example of how opposites attract, but also prove that even teenage love can be real and life-changing as well. Though Jamie struggles to overcome her secret illness alone, Landon forces her to open up and allow for him to help her through her heartrending battles with leukemia. As I said before, this is an emotional and moving must-read novel by Nicholas Sparks. Just make sure you equip yourself with plenty of kleenex!     - Monique Ritter, Author of The Song Unsung

9889979942|5.0|With just a few minutes to write this review I believe that I should sum up this amazing piece of work, by saying how I really enjoyed sharing this book with my boys as an introduction to Chinese culture.  I was pleasantly surprised with all the love and thought captured in each picture.  You really get a sense of these people throughout the different regions.    With all the vivid colors, this is an amazing capture of life.....Tom Carter is truly an artist behind his lens.
0446567337|4.0|Dear John is a fantastic novel - ranking up there with The Notebook and A Walk to Remember, two of my other favorites by Nicholas Sparks. It had all of the elements that Sparks is known for in his novels - love, heartache, sacrifice. Dear John follows the story of a young boy in the army who falls in love with a very beautiful \\"sheltered\\" girl right before leaving to war around the time of  9/11. Their love, though only founded within a three week time period, was strong enough to last while they were apart - or at least that is what they originally hoped for. However, time and war have a way of changing people and their desires. Dear John takes a look at young love, family, and relationships and the way they seemingly impact the lives of all involved.     This is certainly a quick and easy read - a great beach book for sure. Though it involves a young man in the army and the Gulf war, the emphasis of the novel is not on that but instead on the relationship that exists while they are apart. Another successful love story from Nicholas Sparks!    - Monique Ritter, Author of The Song Unsung
9889979942|5.0|China Portrait of a People is a frank look at the faces and lives that are all a part of the largest country in East Asia.    A book of photos.  Each one has a story.  What history lies behind this face?  Sometimes it is clear, sometimes a mystery, sometimes happy, at other times tragic.  We can see a wide variety that represents the country of China herself.  Children training in the way of Shaolin to workers building infrastructure.  Peasant farmers to too-cool teens.    The book paints a vivid picture of China.  Carter set out on an adventure in 2004 and with his book he invites you along.  Traveling with him is an exciting and eye opening experience.    I recommend this colourful journey to anyone interested in the Middle Kingdom.
1439152756|4.0|Still Alice, by Lisa Genova, may quite possibly be one of my favorite books! It is a heart-wrenching novel told from the point of view of a woman in her 50's who discovers that she has early onset Alzheimer's disease. It is a fascinating read as it allows you to see and understand this disease from a very personal perspective as it slowly deteriorates the mind of main character Alice.     Alice is a renowned professor of cognitive psychology at Harvard, which builds the irony throughout Genova's story, since understanding the mind is Alice's profession. However, when she begins to lose her memory, we are pulled into the sadness of Alice's world as she first discovers her illness and then prepares to tell her family and her colleagues. The reader is allowed, first hand, to experience the frustration that comes with this disease - from the beginning stages (forgetting things, getting lost, grasping for words and memories) to the later and more devastating stages (not recognizing her own husband and children).     This book is a must read for anyone who knows someone with Alzheimer's disease or for someone who wants to further understand the disease. Even if that's not the case, which wasn't mine in picking up the book, it is a story that will not only educate you, but will move you as well. I give my highest recommendation to Lisa Genova's book, Still Alice.     - Monique Ritter, Author of The Song Unsung

The two teenagers, Landon and Jamie, are a perfect example of how opposites attract, but also prove that even teenage love can be real and life-changing as well. Though Jamie struggles to overcome her secret illness alone, Landon forces her to open up and allow for him to help her through her heartrending battles with leukemia. As I said before, this is an emotional and moving must-read novel by Nicholas Sparks. Just make sure you equip yourself with plenty of kleenex!     - Monique Ritter, Author of The Song Unsung
1603425381|5.0|This is my review for this book. I also posted this review on my blog at [...]    Why is this edging book different from all other edging books? Corners! The majority, if not all, edging books out on the market show how to work a long and flat crocheted edging. That's fine if you just want to trim the bottom of a towel, but what if you want to edge an afghan? or a scarf? or the whole towel? That's where this book comes in. It has patterns for 150 different crocheted borders, each one showing you how to turn the corner. The book essentially has two main parts: section 1 talks about the logistics of crocheting borders and section 2 is filled with patterns for 150 different borders    Section 1 - Edgings and More    Many people will buy this book just for the edging patterns, but this first section makes the purchase price worth it all by itself. It has information every crocheter should know. It discusses how to evenly crochet around a piece as well as methods of joining and changing colors. I especially love the fact that this section is full of color photos showing you exactly what Edie is talking about. It's one thing to read about how to create an even, flat border, but it's quite another to see bright, clear photographs illustrating what to do and not do. When I was reading through this section, I was a bit confused by the explanation of a single crochet and double crochet join, but with the aide of the photos I was able to figure it out.    Since most borders can only be worked over a certain multiple of stitches, this section walks you through determining how many stitches you have and which borders will work. If you are math phobic, don't worry. Edie explains what to do step by step and even includes an example that you can look over.    I have to say that I love the method she gives for working edges on a piece of regular (i.e. not crocheted) fabric. If you have ever spent hours, like me, punching holes in the hem of a fabric in order to crochet an edging, then you will absolutely LOVE the method in this book.    Section 2 - The Edgings - 150 crocheted designs, instructions, and charts    Ah...the patterns :-) There are a stunning variety of edgings to choose from, and you can find one to suit any project. Some are dainty while others are bold and showy. Some use simple stitches, some use more advanced stitches, some use beads or buttons, and some use innovative techniques to create a fabulous edge. Oh, and some are fabulously 3 dimensional. Clear sample photos show you sections of the edging, including a corner, of course. The samples are worked in the beautiful array of colors that I've come to expect from Edie's work in her previous book, Beyond the Square Crochet Motifs.    Some of my favorites: #123 is perfect for edging a Breast Cancer Awareness project. #142 has a fantastic variation of the single crochet, #27 looks regal while using mostly basic stitches, and #65 if my daughter saw this one she'd make me crochet her a blanket just so it could have this edge.    Each pattern is written for a border crocheted in the round. Accompanying each written pattern are two stitch diagrams. The first is simply the symbol \\"translation\\" of the written directions. The second chart shows modifications that may be necessary if you need to work the pattern back and forth (flat) instead of in the round. This would come in handy if you wanted to make tied headbands or bracelets using the edging patterns. There is a stitch symbol key located in the back of the book to help you decipher the charts. In addition to that, there is also a spread showing some of the basic symbols and explaining some of the logic behind symbol diagrams.    Overall, I'd say this book is a great addition to any crocheter's library, and a must have for anyone who wants to really learn how to make fantastic edgings.
0061703257|4.0|DL sets a wonderfully imaginative (sinister, brooding) scene in SI.  The writing is fast-paced; the characters well-drawn; the story interesting throughout.  That said, the reader knows to expect some great twist in due course.  And whatever certain book-jacket critics may say about having been blown away when it was revealed to them, I find it hard to believe they really were.  All roads lead, pretty early on, to one likely shocking ending for SL, and the likeliest shock is the shock you get.  It's a credit to DL's gift for storytelling that this reader, at least, did not feel cheated for having predicted the ending of this entertaining novel long before it got there.  My guess is most readers have done the same.  I can't give LS 5 stars, but I enthusiastically give it 4.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|In one season, FlashForward introduced viewers to a unique situation, populated by compelling characters.  What if everyone in the world collapsed at the same time and had a vision of themselves in the future?  Fans of the program LOST and intelligent scripted shows will appreciate the complexity and depth of this story.
B003ES5JDS|5.0|DC animation admittedly can be VERY uneven. Bruce Timm, as much as I am grateful for his stewardship of most of Batman: The Animated Series, and the Superman animated series can really bite the big one. I'm not a fan of the Doomsday, or even the New Frontier adaptations, and innumerable other projects he's taken on.     But here, he knocks the ball out of the park. The animation is first rate! Dark, moody, and with the right kinetic feel to make it seem like a comic book come to life. Like something that could only exist in animation terms.     They stick close to the original story (with a few minor variations, which serve the story, as a stand alone, outside of continuity, quite well), and the script is by Judd Winick, so I'm glad for that.     The music serves the story very well. The acting, for the most part is first rate (I'm an actor, so please forgive me for nitpicking this part).     Bruce Greenwood takes over the role of Batman (look him up on imdb, you know him, yeah you do) from Kevin Conroy, and sounds almost exactly like him! Which is not a bad thing. He does a really great job! Kinda feel bad for Kev, who otherwise is the only guy that should be allowed to play the role, but hey, if he had a sore throat on the day... Bruce did a bang up job!     Jenson Ackles (the pretty boy from Supernatural) does a very pretty boy job of playing the the Red Hood. And, ok, I realise he has his fans, but I just don't think he's all that. I think they cast a name, and I think they could have done better. He doesn't suck... but he's helped by a really good script!     Neil Patrick Harris plays Nightwing... Not bad, not great, too small a role to be great at. He serves the story well and my only comment is \\"when is the next Dr. Horrible coming out!\\"     The Joker, as played by John DiMaggio is frankly week! But he's not in enough of the movie to be a detriment. Still, they should have stuck with Mark Hammil.     But for all the nitpicking and whatnot, I gotta say... thisis a first rate animated feature, with as much balls as the format will allow.     I saw an interview once with Bruce Timm, where he joked that his core audience was a bunch of thirty and forty year old's who still read comics. If that's true, why don't you write and draw for the adult mindset instead of saturday morning cartooning it? Instead of sanitizing it, in other words.     This one almost feels like he's playing to that core audience he joked about. It's well worth adding to your animated collection, and even though I've seen ad advance copy of it, I can't wait to add the 2 disc version to my collection ('cause I'm a geek and I like all those bs features and documentaries that come with them).     If you want, wait 'till the price goes down (it's a tough economy we're stuck in) but put on your wanted list, it's worth the wait!
B000003GBN|5.0|As a used record collector I happen to have both of these recordings on their original red label stereo shaded dog RCA lp issues. While those 50 something year old records sound very good the audio samples I just heard sound great. And for $7.98 the price is right. While I'll still play my lp copies from time to time I'm buying this CD issue right after I submit my review. Can't wait to hear it on my stereo, So off I go to hit the add to cart button & then on to complete my purchase. I already know that I'll be happy with my CD before it arrives.    Update: Just got my CD in the mail & it sounded wonderful on my stereo system. If you like Fritz Reiner you won't be dissapointed by either the performances or the sound quality as they are both excellent. As others have said Beethoven's 5th Symphony is played a bit fast but Reiners interpretation is still very good & his conducting of Beethoven's 7th is truly excellent.

0142000663|4.0|Beautifully written, but very depressing account of one family's struggle through the depression.  Clearly shows both the bad decisions of farmers who lost their land during this time as well as the injustices thrust upon them as they traveled to California, the land of milk and honey, that turned out to be anything but.  Steinbeck alternates chapters of atmospheric description with the tale of the Joad family who face death, starvation, police harassment and their own ignorance, struggling to stay alive with limited resources.  Not a light read, but worth the time.
B0028AQLYE|5.0|I bought this for my Finis Snorkel, and first I must say to install it(it does say this in its instructions) Place both the top and snorkel end in some hot water for a bit...it softens them both so that you can slide them together.  It works...very well...surface dives only to return to the surface with a dry snorkel. Be warned that as the snorkle is exeptionaly long, adding this does cause slight breathing resistance.  I think its worth it though and as many folks use this for lap swim, its kinda nice to have the resistance.
B003QNXPUK|2.0|I've been the biggest fan of Zagg until a few weeks ago. The screen protector I got for my iPhone 3G protected my phone well, came well packaged, with good instructions, etc.    The iPhone 4 cover on the other hand is a totally different animal.    1) the instructions are printed in a 2x2 piece of paper and they are completely generic, probably works with any stick on cover, so essentially no real instructions    2) came in essentially a paper envelope with the \\"covers\\" and a separate plastic bag with the \\"squeegee\\" and spray.  The plastic bag looked like someone had sealed the sides by using a candle, packaging looked worthy of a $3 product, not a $25 one.    3) the \\"maximum protection\\" just means that you get a few little strips that you can paste around the phone. The strips are not the right size (all were too narrow and a little shorter than needed): probably a result of designing this product before the iPhone 4 was out    4) \\"maximum protection\\" leave still leaves all of the glass edges, the bottom of the phone (completely) and many other parts of the phone unprotected    5) They got stingy with the spray! really, the stuff is barely enough if you don't spray for the side strips and not enough at all otherwise. If you get a wrong application and have to re-apply: well you'll be asking for more spray from Zagg customer support    6) My attempt to correct an address on my Zagg order ended up with one call to some sort of VOIP driven customer service center which was too busy to handle my call and then a sequence of 5+ different emails asking me to send $2.95 more for shipping (this was a result of my error but the customer support mechanism is terrible).    7) The $2.95 above to get a new one sent is probably their actual cost to make this looking at the packaging and the presentation: knowing how well Zagg products were previously packaged (with ample spray stuff etc), this is really disappointing.    8) The spray evaporates in like a second (literally), so getting the things on is pure torture, be prepared to dedicate 30 mins of your life and 100% of your attention and you will still have an imperfect application    So, bottom line, now that I have it on the phone what do I think: well it covers most of the front and back of the phone well so scratches in those areas will probably be protected from, but I still need a cover for the edges since \\"maximum coverage\\" did nothing.    Disappointing from a company that I used to be a big fan of.      EDIT: and yes, the strips break at each of the antenna \\"junctions\\" on the phone and don't fully insulate from the hand touching the antenna, therefore NOT a solution to the iPhone 4 antenna issues.
0307388921|4.0|chuckie p took the torch from vonnegut and continues to carry it well aloft here. i'm a fight club man, but this one's great. if you're a CP reader, you'll certainly like it. it's right in that pocket of what you'd expect: the unexpected, the absurdity, the chorus-like refrains, the controlled philosophical rants, the  erudition, the existentialism, the ennui, the plot that loops back on itself in order the propell it forward, the dark and the light, the nilihism and the romance, the vaudvillean, classic humor along with the too-clever-by-half humor, the agony and the ecstacy. like all CP i've read so far: no matter what you may think about the story, the characters, the absurdity, it doesn't matter: you simply cannot put it down. it's compelling fiction, and--disect it and deconstruct it and criticize it all the live long day--that's all that matters folks.
B0018BF1HW|5.0|This package of five classic Jeff Beck Albums is a great way to get an overview of this artist's phenominal history. The price is more than fair and the product can't be beat. The sound quality is wonderful on these legacy recordings. There are some who are put off by the mini album sleeve packaging and the lack of extended liner notes. But if thats what you want then buy the individual CD's . This package however gives you all the great music at a great price and that's what really matters to me anyway. I highly recomend these cd's as well as the others in this series.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Annie Special Anniversary Edition is an award-winning musical using award-winning actors and actresses.  Carol Burnett gives a top-notch portrayal of a drunken, no-account keeper of the orphans.  All of the children give great performances backed by excellent musical numbers.  A must-see for anyone who is jaded by today's societal mores.  The extras included with the movie are a nice cap to the main entertainment, which is the best escapism vehicle around today, in my opinion.
0596009208|4.0|This book's main specialty in my opinion is learning the language itself (versus use of language). It really helps you understand not only what is going on, but why you do things a certain way. This is what sets it apart from some of the other good Java books. However, I wish it had more real life code. A little less animals and shapes kind of stuff. It also seemed like Java generics (ArrayList&lt;MyClassType>) was kinda thrown in at the end. Also, database coverage was lacking entirely. Since almost all real applications these days (especially business apps) use them, it is an issue to not have a good bit of coverage of them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good core explanation of the language<br />Good core explanation of object oriented programming<br />Easy to read and move at a pace that you like<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not much \\"real code\\" that you would reference later<br />Not many \\"real life\\" examples. Lots of animals, instead of real life uses<br />A little lacking in certain areas like GUI design (of course Swing is pretty weak in this area...)<br />Database coverage<br /><br />Your best bet is to get this book and read it cover to cover to really understand Java. Then grab Murach's Java 6 book to further that understanding and see the language used in real life situations including databases. You can also reference Murach's later too since it has good code examples.
031606792X|1.0|I just finished reading Breaking Dawn after consuming the first 3 books at breakneck speed.  I was so excited to find out what would happen to our dear hero and heroine!  Unfortunately, I was so disappointed.  First of all, I wish there was more written about Bella and Edward's actual relationship.  Of course we known Edward is hot and Bella is endearing with all of her human idiosyncrasies, but I had troubling figuring out what really connected them.  They spent most of their time arguing about whether she should be changed into a vampire, when, and by whom.  And they argued about when to have sex.  It takes a lot more than that to have a real relationship!  I wish I knew if their tastes in music were similar, if they made each other laugh, etc...  It sure seemed like Bella and Jacob had a much better camaraderie.<br /><br />I was startled that Edward and Bella were married so early in the book.  It seemed like Bella finally caved in to Edward's proposal so she could get him in the sack.  That's not the best foundation for marriage!  And it would have been much better if she had been able to sort out her feelings for Jacob and get some complete closure for that whole situation.  Now we get to the human/vampire baby...  Creepy.  Even as I read Twilight I wondered if Edward could do the deed considering that his human processes were dead.  It seemed inconsistent that he could father a child (or even participate in the act, to put it delicately) when his body didn't function at all like that of a human, undead male.  I couldn't believe that Jacob imprinted on the ridiculously named baby (Renesmee?  What?!).  That whole situation was far too complex for such an easy (and unnerving) out.  I had been hoping Jacob and Leah would find each other.<br /><br />I won't go into the whole situation with the Volturi.  It was exciting to finally see a situation brewing which could have massive consequences, and then the whole darn thing just petered out into a love fest.<br /><br />In the end Bella is happy because she's beautiful and strong and she's got her man forever.  But that misses out on all that is wonderful about being human!  And it's so superficial.  It would have been so much more interesting if she had remained human and continued to grow in herself and her love for Edward - oh the stories that could have been told!ppy because she's beautiful and strong and she's got her man forever.

0786838655|4.0|How would you like it if you were the nephew of Hades? What if Zeus, Hades' brother, was your uncle?<br />What if Poseidon, the god of the sea, was your father?<br />Welcome to the world of Perseus Jackson, a troubled, dyslexic student from New York. He's never met his real father and his mother is married to a jerk who doesn't care one bit about them. After a failed attempt at a vacation with his mother because he was being chased by monsters, Percy lands on Half-blood Hill with his best friend Grover. There, he discovers his incredibly old heritage. After some training, Percy is picked to go on a very important quest: to find Zeus' lightning bolt, which has been stolen. Zeus is blaming Poseidon, who is angry with Zeus for accusing him. If Percy doesn't find the lightning bold before June 21st, the Summer Solstice, there will be a great war between the gods that could be impossible to stop.<br /><br />While I enjoy and love a lot of the books I read, there have been a few thorns in the rosebush recently.  A lot of people said they loved the Pendragon series, but I hardly got through half of the first book, and that was with skimming. So, even though everyone I've talked to says they love this book, I was a bit skeptical...<br /><br />I am skeptical no longer! I was surprised at how well-written and easy-flowing this story is. Percy is a real kid, one you would see at a school. He's got human weaknesses and personality traits and strengths (excluding the powers he's inherited from his father).  Rick Riordan does a wonderful job at making Percy Jackson a kid you can relate to and at least like. The other characters, too, even with their powers or god/monster-like deformities, seem real.<br />And this story is funny. I've found myself enjoying the humor way more than expected. Grover is always hungry and talks about food in his sleep. There is a lot of sarcasm about Percy's life, and Percy himself has a nice sense of humor.<br /><br />I love Greek and Roman mythology, so this was a real treat. Riordan is very knowledgable in this subject and gives you the facts as Homer would have, except at a much easier level.  Riordan has created a wonderful series that I can't wait to finish. The second book has yet to come in at the library, but I'm looking foward to it!is very knowledgable in this subject and gives you the facts as Homer would have, except at a much easier level.

B002Q0F6V0|5.0|A perfectly crafted album that I find myself increasingly wanting to listen to.  It is more subtle and purposeful than previous albums, but the amazing harmonies and melodies are still intact - and DuVall is an impressive addition.  Highly recommended.
0399156577|4.0|This had all of the elements NR fans look for - a strong female, inevitable attraction to the \\"wrong\\" man, and many specific details that make her character real.  So, yes, there are several scenes with thorough descriptions of dog training.  That's to be expected...she's a dog-trainer, and the initial contact with Simon is through his puppy.  I greatly enjoyed my time with this story, just sitting in my reading chair with our chocolate lab at my feet.
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|A bit dated but still nicely done.  The tale is more than an excuse to show bare chested guys and surf scenes.  There's an actual attempt to cover the surfer culture and even focus on the spiritualism of the sea.  Overall, there are some nicely done action scenes and the manner of locating The American Presidents feels believable.  Very small role by a thin Tommy Sizemore.  Still some great humor scenes, too.  Keanu is referred to as \\"Young, dumb and full of cum.\\"  LOL  MY GRADE: B plus.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The Plot is great,  a little predictable but that is okay because it is a lot of fun.

If your a Huge Sci-Fi Fan then this movie is a must. If you dont care alot for CG like me, Then this Movie probably will turn the table around for you like me becuase it's the best Most life like CG to date and I mean it looks great.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Planet Earth was phenomenal and can be said the sole reason I decide on getting a Blu-Ray player.  To view the magnificent images shot through years of dedicated camera work.  This new series by BBC called Life is no different.<br /><br />Eager with anticipation with the release of the Blu-Ray version of Life, I held off purchasing it for the fact that the original release of Life (or the U.S. version) was narrated by Oprah Winfrey.  Like Planet Earth, rather than get the Sigourney Weaver narration, I had to wait for the David Attenborough narrated version.<br /><br />These BBC documentaries are awesome and highly enjoyable.  From the ambient sounds to the crystal clear high quality video, I learn while I watch.  I get to see nature very candidly as the producers and camera crews were meticulously detailed in capturing nature.<br /><br />I use to collect DVD's but never started a Blu-Ray library collection.  I make an exception to own these BBC series and Planet Earth as well as Life are definitely certain items to add.

B0015DROBO|4.0|This was the slowest start to a book I've read in a while- I usually have a \\"50 page rule\\" in that if I'm not really into it w/in 50pages I don't continue-- so glad I read them all.  You really do need to start with this book to get more depth and background for the following 2 books - get insight into personalities and why they think & act as they do.<br /><br />For those people who think Larsson writes with an anti-women attitude- I totally disagree- his female characters in all the books are strong, and he roots for the underdog.  Having been a writer who brought out social injustices in his other work, this is simply another way for him to do that.  The stories (all 3 books) are a bit far fetched - but still very entertaining.<br /><br />*** This is on DVD now too- and I normally will never see a movie if I read the book, but this is the original Swedish version w/ subtitles- it was completely on mark.  The characters are NOT Hollywood glamorous- just real people- and the woman who played Salander was PERFECT.  Just a word of warning for those reading the book or seeing the movie- not for the squeemish.

0394818237|4.0|Richard Scarry had a tremendous gift for telling stories that, while simple in plot, are rich in visual detail so that, having been read aloud once, they provide hours of entertainment for prereaders to enjoy at their leisure. His lively, fill-up-the-page artwork and classic sense of humor have endeared him to children for over fifty years.<br /><br />In this book, Scarry introduces individual citizens of Busytown, then tells short stories about specific projects they are involved in: building a house, mailing a letter, putting out a fire, visiting the hospital, riding a train, growing a crop, lumberjacking and processing wood, building a road, taking an ocean voyage, and making bread.  By interweaving these individual stories, he shows how greater social process work together in industrial society.  Each story demonstrates the value of work, both for the individuals who perform it and those who enjoy its effects.  It's a wonderfully orienting book, helping even very young children understand the interworkings of their society.<br /><br />This abridged edition is easy to find, but disappointingly, the unabridged version (which includes a stay-at-home mom, policeman, water treatment processes, and electric plant) has become a collector's item.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Some of my friends thought this started out slowly, but I jumped right into it- a faster read that the prior 2 books.  I have read that Larsson's wife has a draft of book #4 that was not left w/ the publisher- and I really hope she can get it published, as I can see where the story may have several potentials to move.  He intended to have a series of 10.<br /><br />You could probably read these books on your own, as he does go back & reference prior events from the earlier books, but to really get the depth of characters, you do need to read them all in order.<br />Sad to see the series end.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|I read this when it first came out & prior to it becoming an \\"Oprah book\\". I loved the story & her writing was very visual... It helps that I am a meditator & I was a prior devotee of her Guru (who remains nameless in the book).  I love reading about travel, as well as spiritual books.  I do speculate as to why she didn't really mention who her Guru was, as this group use to be very \\"out there\\" in media and trying to recruit members/devotees-- unfortunately the group has had a lot of prior members come out & make accusations of sexual misconduct, abuse and financial problems... not my place to air that here, but it's probably a good thing she didn't make it public as I wouldn't want anyone to get involved in this scam religion.  The teachings themselves are great, but you can find them anywhere, they are not new. Just get yourself a copy of the Upanishads & you'll be set.    It was an overall fun read & I'm glad she found happiness.  Should be interesting to see if they butcher it in the movie version or it it turns out well.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|EMI and DG--which also drew on the catalogues of Decca and Philips--have each produced complete-edition boxed sets to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Mahler's birth. One set seems like an inexhaustible treasure trove; the other one is more like a mere assemblage of all of Mahler's music. Despite its boasting some outstanding performances (Karajan's live Ninth and Haitink's 1966 Third are two of them, while Solti's Eighth and Bernstein's Fifth definitely are NOT), I can't imagine recommending the DG set over this edition. It's not only that many of the performances in the EMI set are among the very best of the specific works they represent, but also that the whole set has been so thoughtfully and sensitively put together. This really is a case of the sum being greater than its parts, and more valuable than any of EMI's single-conductor boxed sets in representing both the breadth of the composer's expressiveness and the interpretive possibilities inherent in his scores.
B002JCSWV6|1.0|I hated this film.  Morgan Freeman is not cut out to play Nelson Mandela; the real Mandela deserves better representation. Freeman could not keep the South African accent going, he looked disconnected from the rest of the actors and totally awkward, no warmth, no substance, no serious undertaking of Mandela character. Matt Damon's talents were totally wasted here. And to know that Clint Eastwood directed a movie about this topic is a joke. This was sheer mockery of an important subject matter. Clint Eastwood should stick to what he knows best, and taking on a very dynamic and important man as Mandela was not something Eastwood was capable of accomplishing.

It includes good and accurate examples the reader can test in almost any database system.  Overall, the book will save the inexperience from many failures and embarrassment.    I purchased this book hoping to find something new.  Unfortunately, I have been in the trenches long enough to live through and see most of these patterns.   This book will be a great addition and a must read for application developers, new database professionals including DBA, developers and architects.

B003C5FMEE|5.0|I've seen Trombone Shorty in New Orleans several times, but over 4th of July I got to see him at the Portland Blues Festival in both large and small venues.   He is a very talented musician, and he played trumpet more than trombone in the recent shows I saw.   This is reflected in the album, which is a great funky modern vibrant hip recording.   Featuring Allen Toussaint and Lenny Kravitz.
B003CN5B6K|5.0|IF ONLY NBC, USA Network's parent network, could harness the creativity of their cable programming. With series such as \\"Burn Notice,\\" \\"Royal Pains,\\" \\"In Plain Sight\\" and, now, \\"White Collar,\\" USA is the turn-to station for entertainment.   The chemistry sells it. Matt Bomer (\\"Chuck\\") plays handsome con artist/thief Neal Caffrey. Tim DeKay (\\"Carnivàle\\") is the by-the-book FBI agent, Peter Burke, a likable Joe Friday responsible for catching Caffrey twice. The agent makes a deal with the thief, allowing Caffrey to serve out the remainder of his four year sentence under Burke's supervision, helping the FBI solve high-end crime. Together they bust stock scams, art theft, diamond heists and bond forgeries.   Sounds simple, right? Wrong - Caffrey has a personal agenda he plays out while working with his new friends. He's got a two mile movement radius on the ankle tracker he's forced to wear and he makes good use of it.   Caffrey and Burke are aided by a merry band of characters including conspiracy fanatic/thief Mozzie (Willie Garson) and Burke's smart and beautiful wife Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen). Diahann Carroll shows up as a recurring guest star, as lovely as ever. In face, every co-actor is superb, contributing their own unique touch to each caper.  The 14-episode, three-disc set looks great on Blu-ray. Filmed in the Big Apple, settings are clean and crisp. Color is good and skin tones spot on with a decent wash of grain. Fashion is stunning and you can learn more about the choices in the featurette, \\"Cool Cat in a Hat.\\" Sporting a vintage Rat Pack look complete with fedora and tie clasp, Caffrey could be Carrie Bradshaw's twin brother. DeKay and Thiessen look sharp, too.   A DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 allows witty patter to shine while offering some ambient, surround sound city noise. There aren't many big special effects outside of the season finale.   Additional extras include Jeff Eastin talking about casting his two main characters, a few good natured commentaries, a gag reel and deleted scenes. Series tech consultant, Tom Barden, a former FBI agent, talks about his work in \\"Nothing But the Truth.\\" Fascinating stuff  but it should have been longer.   Highly recommended!
B002ZG997C|3.0|Somebody drops the big one.  All that remains are rusty cars, broken freeway overpasses and matte paintings.  There are two groups of people, healthy and not so healthy and the usual assortment of bandits who look like the guy with the ammunition belts at the end of Raising Arizona.  The \\"twist\\", if you can call it that, is that the hero is carrying a book.  Now, in case you really cannot guess instantly what book it is, the title of the movie is \\"The Book Of...\\"  Still not sure?  Well, it turns out, the book guides Eli and shows him a path to follow.  So, is it (a) Playboy's Party Jokes, (b) How To Use Your Kenmore Washer or (c) the Bible?  I'm not going to give it away, sorry.<br /><br />Things plod along, and towards the end, Eli is forced to part with the book.  He reaches his destination without the book and then, you will never, never guess what happens, unless you saw Farenheidt 451, maybe 40 years ago.  So things really rest with Denzel, who as usual, is very good and how much you want to read into all this.  I suppose it could be very inspirational if you can avoid getting bogged down by having seen it all before.  Then again, maybe that's what the book is trying to say.  You may think you've invented something new but its all been done before.
0307456625|5.0|the words in the header are few which come to mind when you are reading the book - it is a classic - it portrays a picture of Africa which very few other authors have ever been able to do - this is like Africa - a lighter version of Nadim Gordimer - everything is simple - it is difficult to portray simplicity without making it boring but McCall Smith has pulled that off in flying colors - his respect for the land and its people flows through every line - the protagonist Mma Ramotswe exudes confidence and walks up against all odds with the courage of a warrior - it can be a petty thief or a political big-shot - she is afraid of none but she does not treat them equally - she adjusts to the situation within her limited means - there is a continuous undercurrent of her love for Africa and its people - she respects the nature, the land and its people - it thows a new light on the Africans in Botswana region - but it does not hide the illegal trades or the lack of opportunities - everything is painted in beautiful colors - the stories are complete even though smith does not write long sentenses - you never know what is coming - simple turns but Mme Ramotswe manages to fascinate us with her boundless talent and curiosity -<br /><br />this book is an absolute wonder and may change your idea about Africa-
B0004Z33F0|2.0|Whoever thought it a good idea to translate all the background Russian dialog and place it in big yellow letters on the screen should be shot.  It adds absolutely nothing to the movie and this dialog was clearly never meant to be translated.  It is distracting to have \\"For the Motherland\\" or \\"Stop, dog.  Stop dog\\"  blaze onto the screen in the middle of an action sequence.  And, yes, there is no way to turn it off.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|*****This review may contain SPOILERS******<br /><br />I watched \\"Sunshine\\" expecting a grade B movie. Instead, I found a movie that tried to be profound and failed. Meaning making fun of it like I'd anticipated was hard.<br /><br />Since the movie really did try to take things seriously, then I must mention that if this had been a real space operation, it would have been the most poorly designed manned spaceflight mission ever.<br /><br />For one thing, why was only one person trained to detonate the bomb which was the critical part of the mission? In fact, the crew overall seems locked into their own specialties with no cross training. When the fate of humanity rides on that mission, you'd think everyone would be trained to do everyone elses' job.<br /><br />Second, why was there no contingency plan created before they left Earth for what to do if they ran into the \\"Icarus I?\\" Considering they knew it disappeared somewhere close to the sun, they would have known it was a possibility. Why didn't they plan for it?<br /><br />Third, why was only one man doing critical calculations for adjusting their course? During modern spaceflights, calculations are double and triple checked by multiple people to reduce the risk of errors. Why wasn't every crew member making these critical calculations?<br /><br />Fourth, when there's a fire on a space ship, you'd think that a ton of alarms would go off.<br /><br />Sure, I know the movie was reaching for existential questions and answers. I found such poor mission planning detracted from speculating over such questions, though, as I kept pondering why in the face of extinction they would resort to such poor planning.<br /><br />In addition, the film was hard to follow (my husband had a hard time figuring out who the homicidal captain was until I explained it to him, and when Capa appeared on the portion of the ship carrying the payload without a space suit on after having been in a space suit last we saw we both had a hard time figuring out what happened), there were inconsistencies (when Capa was questioning the computer about their oxygen supplies he was told they had 19 hours left until they could detonate the bomb, yet all that happened when he found out about the fifth crew member seemed to go down in only an hour tops, not 19), and really was just hard to get into. I felt detached and uninvested throughout the whole film.<br /><br />Bottom line, save yourself some time and skip this movie.a was questioning the computer about their oxygen supplies he was told they had 19 hours left until they could detonate the bomb, yet all that happened when he found out about the fifth crew member seemed to go down in only an hour tops, not 19), and really was just hard to get into.

B002UNMW7O|5.0|This follow up to THE BOONDOCK SAINTS got terrible reviews when it came out, so I wasn't expecting much.  I was therefore very pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  You know it's going to be a great film right from the beginning, where the ghost of Rocco asks if you're \\"a talker or a doer\\".<br /><br />After an Irish priest is murdered in Boston, the McManus brothers come out of retirement to seek revenge.<br /><br />BOONDOCK SAINTS II is very violent, as was the first, but it is not gratuitous violence.  The film is thought-provoking - a movie with a moral/message.  And this sequel fills in a lot of the blanks that were in the first.  It also adds a lot of interesting new elements to the brothers' anointed mission to combat the criminal underworld.<br /><br />You need to see the original BOONDOCK SAINTS movie before seeing this one.  Viewers who haven't will have difficulty understanding and enjoying this one.<br /><br />If you've seen the original BOONDOCK SAINTS, however, this one will blow you away!  Buy it, because it's the kind of film you will want to revisit.

B002ZG981E|4.0|Before I saw this movie this afternoon, I didn't pretend to have an interest in it.  I'm not sure why, its just no one could be very specific about what it was about, so it all sounded dull to me, the most I heard was \\"Its about a guy going in to people's dreams.\\"  Other than that I didn't hear much else.  I have watched films by Christopher Nolan before, such as \\"Momento\\", and the new Batman films, but not because he did them, just because they sounded intriguing.  I learned a while ago not to pin expectations on any director, just to watch a movie and hopefully it'll be semi-enjoyable.<br /><br />  With my mindset as it was, having never seen a preview or anything, I actually feel VERY blessed.  The truth is is that you are better off not knowing anything about it as this movie is so complex and has many mysteries in it that it is just worth experiencing it and having someone try to describe it to you is kind of a waste of time, just go see it.  I will just say that it is hands down the best action film of the year, though its much more than an action film.<br /><br />  The thing that you should know about this movie is that it seems, from the reviews I have read and the people I have talked to whom have seen it, what will determine how much you enjoy this is a. Your expectations of the movie. b.  If you want something that makes you think as opposed to only a thrill ride.  or c.  You have an interest in dreams.  As many have said the film is slow and boring, but for me it was a very intriguing analysis of the sleeping state of the mind, but it definitely would have fared better with everyone if it had a more concise script.  The acting was pretty good, I am not particularly a fan of Dicaprio, but he did a pretty decent job as did all of the cast with what they were given, and other than Dicaprio's character and one other character, there was not a lot of character development, but there was definitely enough in his character alone to keep it interesting.  It is nice to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a higher profile movie, and its also nice to see Ken Watanabe and Ellen Page again as well.  The script had some glaring problems such as, at times, a lack of momentum and a lack of character development outside of the main character... but those are pretty minor since the movie quite effective and enjoyable for the most part and delved deep in to human emotions such as guilt and the long-term effects they can have on us.<br /><br />  I want to do an analysis of the film's ideas, but I will not do that here as that's about as much as I can say without ruining anything about the film.  Although this movie is not flawless and borrows from many movies from the late 90's, it does it, for the most part, fairly successfully. Overall, I would say, in a summer (as all summers are) full of midless action films and tired comedies, this is a much welcome reprieve for many movie fans.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyto see Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a higher profile movie, and its also nice to see Ken Watanabe and Ellen Page again as well.

B002ZG99CM|4.0|I just saw this yesterday and came away with a good feeling.  It had the very predictable but still a feel-good story line of a little underdog kid, who gets bullied at school transform himself into a butt-kicking kung fu master.  It also has a very cute puppy-dog romance with a lovely Chinese girl who can dance like Spice Girls and perform like Sarah Chang.  The menacing bully pulls a perfectly intimidating kung-fu performance and Mr Jackie Chan delivered a dramatic but still a comedic performance, while creating a sweet bond with the little Smith.<br /><br />One element that completely exceeded my expectations was Jaden Smith.  He is a force to be reckoned with.  His parents will be credited for this but the truth is, you can have the most genius of parents or the most talented but if you don't possess the determination or talent to carry it through for yourself, it would not make a difference.  This little Smith is equal to the senior Smith in talent and determination.  To think of the training he must have had to master all the amazing kung fu kicks and choreography is mind-blowing.  At the end of the training sequence in the movie, Jaden shows off his little six-pack and lean, kung-fu trained arms and I thought to myself, 'Kid, you are every bit deserving of that, aren't you?'  The Kung Fu skills is not the only art junior Smith mastered.  He was in almost every scene of the movie and his performance packed charisma and charm.  I could not take my eyes off of him.

0634022296|5.0|This book, though not quite complete, is indispensable for the rhythm guitarist trying to demystify the Beatles.  Unfortunately you don't get the songs that they've covered, nor \\"Flying\\", for some reason.  Songs that are driven by alternate instruments, like \\"Within You Without You\\" and finger-picking based songs like \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" are not fully represented, but again, this book is for the rhythm guitarist.  However it does utilize different chord formations to economize on hand movement so that you're not running up and down the neck with chord changes.  Its an added bonus that teaches you different forms of the same chords.  The only caveat is the binding.  Its a softbound binding where it really needs to be spiral-bound.  I took it to a jam session last night and it took a bulldog clip AND my sister to keep it open.    Bottom line, is this book worth it?  Definitely.  For guitar players who can only read tabs and chords (as John and Paul were/are), it more than pays for itself before you get to the \\"B\\" section.  There's never going to be a definitive book giving you note-for-note transcriptions of the Beatles recordings, but this book gives you a good, solid base for learning the songs.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|\\"The Straight Story,\\" David Lynch's quietly brilliant epic, is unlike any film I've ever seen. There are moments when you sense the path, and then it veers in new directions of dignity. Everything about this journey of an elderly man seems earnest and authentic - Richard Farnsworth's final performance, the true story on which the film is based, on-location shooting where the events took place, filming in sequence - eventually coming together as a subtle and unlikely continuation of Lynch's unique vision.    That Lynch had this work in him is one of the most hopeful occurrences in film history. One of the greatest modern directors, he has challenged for decades with unconventional trademark productions, from instant cult classics [[ASIN:B00003CWPL Eraserhead]] and [[ASIN:B000063JDE Blue Velvet (Special Edition)]], the dark period piece [[ASIN:B00003CX9S The Elephant Man]], the horrifying [[ASIN:B001152TL6 Lost Highway]] and [[ASIN:B00062IVM6 Wild at Heart]]. I'm sure I left out a film or TV series, but no matter. Lynch's world is often an excursion through the realms of nightmare. His body of work may not hold up against similar masters Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg, but this one film is superior to any they've ever made. \\"Straight Story,\\" yes, is rated G and yes, is a Walt Disney production, but it's the flip side of Lynch's nightmare, a gentle dream, hopeful and amazingly audacious.          Film-making became art the instant someone exposed a trolley car clacking down a busy street circa 1910. It's instant art, oftentimes possessing the depth of a microwavable lunch. Today, filmmakers move fast, forging visions of animated destruction, car crashes, machine guns and men walking away from exploding buildings. These films are populated with young actors, glistening pecks, slick haircuts, shaved heads and tight clothes. They drive waxed cars with loud motors, jump from helicopters and conduct slow-motion scissor kicks against multiple adversaries.    Lynch's \\"Straight Story\\" is the exact opposite of every convention in film today. It exclusively details the long journey of a wheezing elderly man on the back of a riding lawnmower ambling 5 mph. He moves slower than modern society, gazing at roadside fields, blankets of evening stars, rumbling thunderstorms and cyclists zooming by. He stops to smell the roses, so to say, as he encounters numerous souls, a wayward teenager who actually looks like a teenager, a comfortable middle age family kicked back in lawn chairs, an elderly bartender who serves beer cold, a lawnmower salesman (Everett McGill) who shoots straight, \\"It's a good machine.\\" There are other souls encountered en route to the ultimate soul, an estranged brother embracing his final months of life.    It's based on the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man with failing vision who traveled 200-plus miles on a lawnmower across Wisconsin and Iowa to visit an ailing brother. Richard Farnsworth was a perfect choice for the lead, an elderly actor suffering from cancer on the set (he would die soon after the film's completion). Farnsworth, one of Hollywood's most interesting individuals, had spent a life in the movies, first as an extra in such films as \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" later a stuntman on John Wayne westerns, evolving into the weathered, no-nonsense acting presence we came to love in [[ASIN:B00005LOL4 Comes a Horseman]] and [[ASIN:6301166671 The Grey Fox [VHS]]]. Nominated for an Oscar in this role, Farnsworth gives a heartbreaking performance combining physical and spiritual pain, his soul exposed in every scene (and very much akin to Wayne's final performance in the meandering, cameo-heavy [[ASIN:B00005JSGL The Shootist]]).     \\"The Straight Story\\" is ultimately the microcosm of a man's complete life, one who has embraced anger of the past, has kicked alcoholism, who lives with the scars of years. He's had struggles, a mentally challenged daughter (Sissy Spacek), failing health, minimum income, and yet he's able to view life in a gratified manner. They say some people can see the entire world within their backyard. Lynch has documented such a man and very nearly revealed the secret of the universe. When watching \\"The Straight Story,\\" I'm reminded of [[ASIN:6305081034 The Bicycle Thief]] and [[ASIN:B00005JLMU Ikiru - Criterion Collection]]. It is, quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made, a masterpiece of modern times.

B002VECLVO|5.0|I watched A Single Man last night with Colin Firth.  Well, I didn't \\"watch\\" it with him.  You know what I mean.  It's a bit of an artsy film whose DVD cover will deceive most idiots.  Way to go, Hollywood!  But honestly, the DVD cover is pure representation of what the movie is actually about.<br /><br />Colin Firth plays George Falconer, a teacher who loses his life partner, Jim, of seventeen years after he dies in a car accident.  George receives a phone call telling him what has happened and that he can't come to the wake because the service is for family only.  Just like that, his entire world is taken away from him and he finds himself alone, unable to accept what has happened and unable to mourn the love of his life.<br /><br />The movie shows flashbacks to loving moments in their life together, along with the night they first met.  While in present day, George \\"prepares his papers\\" and contemplates suicide.  The camera takes long looks into his eyes - blank and starring - which are so true and haunting that you can't help but feel the pain he must be experiencing.  The music and the silence only aid in conveying the message.<br /><br />Then there are conversations George has throughout the day with various people: a student of his who has taken up interest in him, a Spanish guido outside a market, a small child in a bank.  When these dialogues are taken place, the dull look to the movie sudden grows bright like a flower blooming, indications of happiness or truth that both George and the movie goer should be paying attention to.<br /><br />While George is on the bed contemplating what position to lie in while shooting himself, a scene that will make you wince as he tosses and turns with the gun in his hand, the phone rings.  It's his neighbor, Charlie (Julianne Moore) who is his best friend and all he has left in life as far as companionship goes.  He has a dinner date with her and while she longs for connection beyond their friendship, George refuses to accept their connection beyond what it already is.  He appreciates what she has given him, but she is bored with life too and eager to return to London.  He encourages her to go.  \\"What are you doing this weekend?\\" she asks him.  \\"I'm going to be very quiet,\\" he answers.  A sad moment between George and the viewer since Charlie has no idea what he really has on his mind.<br /><br />After going home, George reminisces of the night he first saw Jim and decides to return to the bar where they met.  The male student from campus walks in and he and George spark up a conversation that just may give George hope to keep living.  They go for a swim and return to George's place for the evening, but fate creeps in and reminds us we truly don't have control of our destiny.<br /><br />First, being a gay male, I related to this film in so many ways because I've been in a relationship for almost seven years now.  While both of our families are accepting of us and probably would not ban either of us from a hospital or funeral service, a lot of gay couples are not as fortunate enough to have such accepting and loving family members.  So, the pain that George is experiencing from such loneliness and loss plays out on the screen like a horror movie for someone like me, and Firth was very deserving of his Oscar nom that he got for it.<br /><br />Second, the movie explores the thought of loneliness that sadly is a way of life for most humans.  We are so starved for attention or a connection with someone else, but we continue to deny ourselves of such pleasure because we are either too stubborn or too blind.  In the film, George connects with different people all day long, some willing to fill in the gaps in his life temporarily or more permanent, but he can't see them because his mind his focused on only one thing.<br /><br />Like I said, the conflict of color in this movie is so striking and certainly sets the tone.  It's a constant battle between bleak and happy.  The music is trance likeand numbing.  It is a sad reality for some of us that director Tom Ford feeds the viewer with shame and loneliness, like words of hurt that fall from our mouths before we can catch them.  It's the silence in the room when we learn someone is dead, when we only hear our heart beats and question if even our ears are deceiving us.<br /><br />What a beautiful and honest film!  Based on the novel by Christopher Isherwood, I'd love to hear what Chris would say about it.  He wrote it in 1964 but its underlying theme and message is more true today than ever.or Tom Ford feeds the viewer with shame and loneliness, like words of hurt that fall from our mouths before we can catch them.

6305558175|2.0|This movie is just a rehash of a really interesting French movie staring Gerard Depardieu about a real story that has been adapted a lot and fascinated historians for centuries.      I really say if you don't know the story, and sadly the AWFUL Amazon review is intent on doing its best to destroy that experience for you, then this is a case when the French version, the cinematic original, is really the one to watch first.  You'll barely notice the subtitles or realize its not English, it's so fascinating.  It's like an Akira Kurosawa (Japanese) film in that respect, the language is no barrier whatsoever.    What's so amazing in the French film is you're dealing with a real story straight from a Medieval court case.  And it makes so much more sense when you see the essence of the mystery at hand.  In real context rather than the phony Civil War version, the tale is quite mesmerizing.  In its proper setting, the conclusion is also quite realistic and well done.    By the ugly business of the Hollywood rehash you get the tiresome lack of exposure to the original and a melodrama instead of a well acted, interesting piece of history that fascinated literary lions, historians, a Princeton professor, as well as dramatists for over 500 years.  In the French version, you get the most famous French actor in a fine role and you get Medieval France in 1556 which is where it all began.  It's a heck of a tale, but what's even better is following up the movie with a bit of the real history.    Even a quick Google search, after watching The Return of Martin Guerre, will provide you with an amazing tale.  You'll find out the way this story captured people's imaginations for so long, and that there are other versions that transport the idea to other cultures (like Germany, in the Black Forest).    I'd say skip the melodramtic Hollywood version, and go for the real historical drama set in France with the French movie.  Then, seeing the other versions, including Somersby if you like, and finding out about the Medieval court case at the center becomes all the more interesting.      Sometimes, it more fun to try to get closer to the truth first.  This is such an interesting piece of true life that I'd say it's one of those times.

B003C1SPX8|4.0|Fantastic..... the audio re-mastering is just superb.<br /><br />I have watched this concert on VHS many moons ago. Maybe something like 20 + years. We enjoyed it then, with whatever systems we had.<br /><br />Today I own a much better 2 channel stereo, as I am an addict to music. The audio quality just blew me away.... whew. I have had the audio CD for several years now but the audio on the DVD is just too good. The video quality is a bit disappointing though. They have not managed to improve on the VHS tape. My kids are fascinated by Mark's red boots. They have seen only his rather recent concert DVD's, where he looks prim and proper. :-)<br /><br />Hats off to the re mastering team. Thank you very much.

030745455X|4.0|This book grabbed me and sucked me in.  By page 100 I had a hard time putting it down.  The story telling is superb!  However, a few words of caution - there is quite a bit of language and a few graphic sexual scenes.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Hyper-sleep, a stasis for humans traveling in space for years, is a relatively sacrosanct concept in sci-fi.  It's a life preserving process shown in everything from Planet of the Apes to Alien.  From Star Trek and Stargate to Avatar.  But what happens when the chambers, and the mechanisms for keeping humans not only alive but functional upon awakening, malfunction on the immobile bodies?<br /><br />The malfunction of stasis is the basis for Pandorum, both the movie and the resulting condition.<br /><br />Bower (Ben Foster) awakens from his hyperbunk.  Searing pain, confusion.  When this space vessel left Earth in year 2174, the population had skyrocketed to unmaintainable levels and the ship's mission was to follow a probe that found possible salvation for Earth's remaining, starving population.  Only Bower doesn't know how long he's been asleep, it's pitch black, and he hears strange noises.  When Lieutentant Payton (Dennis Quaid) wakes up at least there's two of them.  Right?<br /><br />Initially just about everyone thought this was going to be Event Horizon's sequel.  In some ways that is true.  The difference, however, is that this adds another plot-dimension instead of an alternate dimension.  Think of the visionless claustrophobia of Descent, where every pin drop is an atom bomb, every faint screech is the unknown danger lurking around the corner, waiting to kill, to torture, to feed.  When Bower and Payton slowly uncover the ship's terrifying secrets - powered by a futuristic set and production that looks imminently dangerous - the film becomes perpetually tense and creepy.<br /><br />Pandorum has not received widespread recognition, making it criminally unknown because of woeful promotion.  A solid sci-fi, thriller the combination of action, horror, and sci-fi is captivating from beginning to end.  Sure, it's derivative, and a few scenes could probably have been edited out, but the overall product is an exploration of tried and tested sci-fi practices.  Highly recommended for sci-fi fans, the multiple twist endings should also draw in other cinema fans.<br /><br />Jason Elinthe multiple twist endings should also draw in other cinema fans.

B0002EQ7EC|3.0|Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\" was a joyous moment of rediscovery, wherein Simon reconnected with his muse and the ecstatic release of music poured out. \\"The Rhythm of The Saints\\" is a further venture down that trail, but is missing that integrated feeling that made \\"Graceland's\\" songs seem so refreshing. The songs here seem all but academic; a social studies field trip substituting for creative impulse.<br /><br />There are some pretty good moments on Saints, as \\"The Obvious, Child\\" kicks things of with the echoes of its predecessor. So does \\"Can't Run.\\" But things seems to get dragged down by following songs. Nothing pops out the way several of \\"Graceland's\\" songs did, in fact the demo of \\"Born at The Right Time\\" sounds better and more engaging than the finalized album track.<br /><br />Which may be the problem I've had with \\"The Rhythm of The Saints\\" over these many years. I was lucky enough to see Simon on this tour, and it was an extravaganza. He had easily 20 plus musicians onstage with him and they created a glorious sound. It was rapturous, beautiful. I was on a buzz for days after. This album sounds sterile, like it didn't get a proper meshing of all the parts. As far as Paul Simon's albums are concerned, it merits a C grade.
0321544080|5.0|This is the 1st photography book I have read from cover to cover in one sitting. Joe McNally is a pro and some of the tips are beyond the equipment constraints of most of us, but to hear again and again about the importance of lighting is still valuable for any serious photographer. And many of the tips are independent of equipment - like, seeing differently, finding unusual points of view, how to establish connection with a portrait subject, using natural light to best effect, using wide angle lens close up, employing what's at hand like a bedsheet to improve light... and on and on. So much photography advice around today is about how to improve a photograph digitally. This is all about getting amazing shots in camera. I am inspired!
B001DLM1W0|3.0|I just finished the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was a free download from Amazon onto my Kindle.    You know what I really liked it. Sherlock Holmes is really fun smart guy except he cannot let his super logical brain be diverted by any sort of female wanderings. It makes me wonder about him. He is also a cocaine addict and proud of it. It helps him sort things out. And he has been known to hang out in opium dens.    The stories are very clever and well written. I mean how many people actually have actually read the book? I never had.    Anyways, I give the books a three out of five stars. Three is worth reading. The stories get a little repetitive and I admit I only read about half of them. Sorry!
0307277453|3.0|The discovery of the Tiktaalik fossil in 2004 kick-started  a true media sensation. The discovery was unveiled in 2006 on scientific venues and mass media alike. Your Inner Fish was first published in 2008 and Ted Daeschler and Neil Shubin were both invited to the Colbert Report on separate occasions in 2006 and 2008.<br /><br />The book is interesting but I believe it suffers from a pressure to follow the Tiktaalik momentum. I believe the book lacks a better structural project and I truly hope Professor Shubin publishes a more mature book on comparative anatomy. My opinion is that this new book should re-think its humor leaving out, for example, the Bozo family diagram. I will buy and read it when it comes out.<br /><br />I also think that Professor Shubin abuses the phylogenetic fallacy that says that early branching means primitive. Modern animals compete in ecosystems and are constantly evolving to remain viable in that ecosystem, even if that means to adopt a simple structure. This is the Red Queen Hypothesis, wonderfully described by Matt Ridley on the book The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature. Another book to discuss the fallacy is Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin by Stephen Jay Gould.<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot think of an alternative book on comparative anatomy. A few articles from Stephen Jay Gould come to mind, especially from The Panda's Thumb.<br /><br />Leonardo Alves - Brazil - 2010
0385528752|4.0|SWITCH differs radically from the vast majority of change management texts.  It starts from the same initial premise: change is difficult to implement.  Although it does not cite the old maxim, its sub-title could well be \\"people don't resist change, they resist being changed.\\"  It then takes off on a completely divergent path from that point forward.  The book does provide a framework that it uses consistently, but it is not laden with steps and prescriptions, and in a way that is the whole point.  Most texts focus on the need to get top-down commitment to the thing driving the change, and developing a very conscious rationale such as a powerful business case or perhaps a clear exposition of WIIFM (what's in it for me).  The Heaths point out that the rational perspective is only half of the equation, and that the psyche has to be involved also if the intiative is ever going to develop its own momentum.  And of course if process changes can eliminate the sense of \\"being changed\\" at all, thereby avoiding the whole problem, or prevent any possibility of backsliding, so much the better.<br /><br />Some reviewers have observed that a number of the examples are relevant only in the context of highly-placed executives who can deploy major resources.  My own observation was that the other examples were in fact the meat of the book.  The conventional approach to organizational change pretty much says that you cannot be successful at introducing change unless you are, or have the unmitigated support of, such an executive.  The strategy of appealing to \\"the elephant\\" - the Feeler side - is exactly what is needed if you are trying to effect change at your own level with nothing but influence to rely on.<br /><br />Since I have only just read the book I can't warrant that the framework does work, but it does seem to explain a lot of the times when change initiatives have not worked; I can already see some ways to re-formulate approaches to things that our organization has tried without success to implement over a very long time.  Trying something different can't hurt.without success to implement over a very long time.  Trying something different can't hurt.
1594744475|5.0|When I got this book in, I was first struck by the excellent quality of the book itself.  The book is well put together and the color vibrant.  I absolutely love the fact that every 'recipe' is illustrated for you so you have a guide to work from.  The pictures and step-by-step instructions make it easy to understand and replicate.  I have already started making things from this book.  I made a fun animals out of hard boiled eggs yesterday, and onigiri today.  I am waiting on some nori punches and other tools to come in the mail(I tried three local Asian markets and I could not find so much as a triangle mold) and I think after I get them, I can try some of the more challenging boxes.  5 STARS!!!

0451169514|4.0|IT, by Stephen King, is a very excellent book extremely long but enjoyable.  He  jumps back and forth between 1958 and 1985, tying the two separate time periods together. He weaves an excellent tale of seven friends banding together to fight a shape-changing monster. It lurks in the darkness....It hides beneath the ground...It feeds off the children...But no one really knows what It is, or shape it will be the next time!!!!!<br /><br />Derry, Maine is your typical, ordinary, small east coast town. Every 27 years, the unexplainable happens. It starts with the odd sightings, and then comes the string of murders, most of the victims are children. It had been happening for hundreds years, yet no one has figured out the mystery. Was it to scary to, or the people just chose to ignore it. Whatever the case, the summer of 1958 was different.<br /><br />Seven ordinary children became extraordinary that summer. They were all alike in the way that they had all nearly escaped It, at some point that year, and this is what keeps their friendships together and helps them conquer It. And that summer, they kill It....at least they think they do.<br /><br />A few reviews have stated there are a few parts of this story they will never forget. Nor will I!!!<br /><br />Chinese fortune cookies I will never look at the same way without remembering Stephen Kings IT.<br /><br />Drains in a bathroom wondering if voices are coming from the drains. I was staying in a motel when I got to that bit and there were strange sounds mixed with the sound of the shower exhaustion fan that made the noise sound like voices coming from the floor drain.  Anyone who has read this book will know exactly what I mean.  Parts of this story will stay with me forever, its definately not for the faint hearted.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I learned a long time ago to go with my gut feeling about books and movies, and ignore the tight-@$$ed reviews which expect a book or a movie meet rarefied \\"standards\\". Most of these reviews are more like \\"look at me: I am so sophisticated\\". They ignore the scope and the intended audience, and do a disservice to the author and potential readers alike.    I gave this book a 4-stars grade. It is fun, intriguing, exciting, imaginative, thrilling - basically, it's Dan Brown, not more nor less.    I didn't expect it to meet any imaginary standards: I expected it to be entertaining and captivating, and it was!    If you liked The Da Vinci Code and Digital Fortress, this book is for you.    Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can be said about Firefly that has not been said already? Joss Whedon's short-lived science fiction series seizes the most successful qualities from a half-dozen distinctive genres and recombines them to create an inventive episodic drama that is nothing short of brilliant. The post-apocalyptic spaceways traveled by the Serenity and her diverse crew--with \\"Earth-That-Was\\" left far behind--contain an inspired melding of cultures, lifestyles, personalities, and ideas. Whedon has crafted a unique and unforgettable universe, one that is so believable and engaging that it seems comforting and instantly familiar. There may be something for everyone in this DVD collection. Firefly's highflying adventures are much more than standard space opera. The show's amusing, emotional, and sometimes contemplative stories call upon viewers not only to look to the future of mankind but also to re-examine our shared past, to consider history and heritage in meaningful new ways. The series is almost always believable, thanks in part to some impressive production values. The visual effects, sets, costumes, direction, and music are perfectly executed. More importantly, both the cast and the show's sharp scripts are superb. Firefly is endlessly amusing, it's true, and damned witty too. What's most involving about the show, however, is its undeniable heart. As they laugh and cry together you can see that it would be difficult to watch these episodes without becoming emotionally attached to such a charismatic cast. The only unfortunate aspect of this collection is that it contains so few installments; truly, it's a crime the series was brought to such an early end. Firefly encapsulates the excitement and adventure of science fiction, the soul and humor of a character-driven drama, and all of the down-to-earth charms of a traditional western. Ultimately, however, like all great works of art, the series is much more than the sum of its parts. Firefly delivers on almost every level of expectation and maintains the strength of its spirit throughout. The series has earned its audience accolades and has already become an unforgettable classic.<br /><br />--Brian A.

0739352687|4.0|The Percy Jackson books are wonderful.  We bought the set to listen to on a cross country trip, it kept us all entertained from 31 to 3.  My only complaint is the narrator, some of his voices are not that good, some are down right bad but the main characters are fine and he keeps a good pace to the story that keeps you wanting to know what will happen next.
B003HARV98|5.0|Finally!!  I have been waiting for this album for almost a year. I first heard this group on[...]and I totally fell in love. Marina and the Diamonds is unlike any other group around but if I had to compare it to anything I would have to go with Blondie and the poetry of Regina Spektor. The first 'single' was \\"I Am Not a Robot.\\" With lyrics like 'You've been acting kind of tough lately, smoking a lot of cigarettes lately. But inside you're just a little baby.' Brilliant sound and amazing lyrics. I also really liked \\"Obsessions\\". \\"I wanna erase every nasty thing that bugs me every day of every week.\\"<br /><br />This is a completely unique group with a fresh take on everything. I think every single song is great- but my faves are listed above. Highly rated!!!
0060557818|4.0|A fantastical journey through the world of London Below, that is as believeable as it is engaging.    Gaiman's protagonist, Richard Mayhew, is an unassuming and passive young man who has just settled quite comfortably into the metropolitan city of London with a steady (if unexciting) job and an attractive fiance who's starting to show her true nature as a bossy and uncompromising maneater.    When Richard stumbles across an injured girl by the pavement and decides to help her, his world as he knows it disappears; or perhaps it is more accurate to say that he disappears from his world as they become oblivious of his existence. With a name like Door, this girl can only spell trouble for our hero.    What ensues is a bildungsroman of sorts where young Richard finds himself thrown into the perilous underground world he never knew existed - filled with wayward angels, carnivorous assassins, an invincible female warrior and a marquis with dubious intentions, while trying to help Door dodge her assassins, and find his way back to London above. Along the journey, Richard grapple with issues of courage and sacrifice, trust and betrayal,while his sanity is put to the test.     A huge plus point in the story is Gaiman's attention to vivid details of the world he creates. These include the floating markets which are like mobile bazaars that sell everything from nightmares to rubbish, one of which actually sets up its stalls in the shopfloors of Harrods.    An absorbing urban fantasy that is as timeless as it is modern.
1595825045|5.0|As an artist, I had always admired the rich world depicted in the Avatar:  The Last Airbender animated series.  Having purchased this book, my opinion of the artwork has gone from admiration to outright awe.  This book offers an incredible insight to not only character designs and backgrounds, but to the process of making the show.  Progressions of background creation from concept to sketches to final paintings.  Key animation sequences.  Storyboards.  Character evolution.  Commentary on the creation of the show as a whole, including how it was first conceived and later realized as the incredible work of storytelling and animation we know today.<br /><br />This book has been incredibly inspirational to me.  I'm reading it a little bit at a time, because every time I pick it up I find myself eager to go create my own stories!  It's an instant motivator.  I encourage anyone who has ever yearned to tell their own story to purchase this book.  It's one of the best models out there for how to create a story right!
0439023483|5.0|My son told me that many of the teachers at his school were reading this book He really wanted to buy it for me. After reading the discription I felt I would only be reading it because it was a gift from my 13 year old son. It was not like what I usually read.   I started reading and couldn't put it down. I read it in a day and went back out the next day to buy the second book in the trilogy. I was sad to see that the third hadn't come out yet.   The second book started out slower but quickly hooked me into reading straight through to the end. I can't wait for number 3.   This is a must read... even if you think that your only reading it because someone told you it was a good book.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan has done it again only this time he takes his genius to the sci-fy genre. Nolan who wrote and directed Inception has created a smart multi layered story line that makes more sense than you'll think. The visuals are stunning and extremely well done. Acting wise you couldn't ask for a better cast because each actor made their characters their own. It's also about time they give Leonardo DiCaprio a Oscar because once again he gives a amazing heart wrenching performance. Inception is the film we've been waiting for this year and is the perfect mind bending films of the decade.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell writes engaging and intrepid prose, keeping an interesting story alive by structuring it in a cleverly crafted sequence. He aptly uses case studies to illustrate his points and assumptions and consistently refers to empirical data and academic research to provide facts to support notions, concepts and assertions.<br />You may or may not agree with many of the issues in the book and how they are grouped together to make a case for this or that notion, but surely you will be engaged and definitely get some counter-intuitive facts, notions and peeks into original research that are both interesting and enlightening. Pursue further those of interest to you when desired to get more depth and, above all, enjoy his fresh and thought provoking approach to \\"the things you thought you knew\\" and how they \\"really\\" are or \\"could be\\".
B002JCSWVG|4.0|It matters not how strait the gate,<br />How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />I am the master of my fate,<br />I am the captain of my soul.<br /><br />These words, this verse of the poem by William Ernest Hensley in 1875, was the mantra of Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment in South Africa. He refused to give in to hate. He refused to give in to revenge. But how do you pull along an entire country with you? Especially a country as racially divisive as South Africa where Apartheid was a part of the landscape and politics for nearly 50 years?<br /><br />Risking everything, Mandela achieved greatness by focusing not on politics, but on a sport: Rugby. Wanting to win the World Cup and thus unite a country, Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freman, [[ASIN:B001GKJ2FC Wanted]]) sets out not to divide and conquer, but to unite and calm the racial tensions raging through his beloved South Africa.<br /><br />With him, Mandela must convince Rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon, [[ASIN:B000M5AJQI The Departed]]) that their poorly performing team can do the impossible: win the World Cup.<br /><br />As most of us now know, that is precisely what happens, and South Africa, for a while, forgets her bloody black-and-white past and turns everyone flush with excitement for simply being South African.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has proven in his waning years that he should remain (mostly) behind the camera and not in front of it. With the exception of [[ASIN:B001KVZ6ES Gran Torino]], I've not been much of a fan of his as of late. However, when it comes to his directing chops, I've been fairly well pleased. Probably my favorite acted/directed Clint film would be the lesser known [[ASIN:B003ASLJOK Heartbreak Ridge]]. But that might just be me.<br /><br />Many have already said that this was \\"the role Morgan Freeman was meant to play,\\" and I won't contradict that. He was completely believable as Mandela, getting the look, verbal cadence and movements of The Great Man down perfectly.<br /><br />Matt Damon on the other hand ...didn't really strike me as the bullish and larger-than-life Francois.

B002VPE1X4|5.0|This isn't the first time I've reviewed an AmazonBasics item and it's also not the first time I've been impressed. This line of items offers you quality items from a name that we all trust, or we wouldn't be here.    If you bought a camera, chances are it came with a case (unless you bought it in China town or somewhere sketchy). The problem with the case that I received was that it was bulky and annoying. Most other cases are pricey, leaving me stuck with the case that I didn't like.     This case is your answer for those of you who are in a similar situation, or don't have a case at all. This case is soft and comes with pockets for both your cameral and another for memory cards or another small things.     This case doesn't cost a lot of money and is quite durable. It will protect your camera from harm. I wouldn't recommend throwing it or intentionally trying to test it, but it should protect your camera from any basic problems. Another great product from AmazonBasics.
B00000DHR0|4.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE Celine's version of Oh Holy Night.  I get goosebumps when she gets to the climactic \\"Christ is the Lord...\\" verse.  Another favorite is The Magic Of Christmas Day (God Bless Us Everyone) which is very catchy and uplifting.      Another Year Has Gone By is kind of weird, not my fav.  There are some other songs that are not the best, that's why I give a 4 rather than a 5 but Oh Holy Night and some others are worth the duds.

0765350386|4.0|This book is a really good read. The world is interesting - the sky is permanently obscured by ash which has been falling for the last 1000 years (ever since the 'Hero of Ages' \\"saved\\" the world and became the immortal Lord Ruler), the plants are all variations of the colour brown. The magic system is one of the best explained I've read and involves \\"burning\\" metals which give a person different abilities ranging from increased strength to the ability to manipulate emotions.     The political system is both cliche and novel - the all-powerful Lord Ruler with his favoured nobles vs the oppressed skaa workers is the cliched Evil Overlord vs the virtuous poor. But the cliche quickly breaks down as we learn more about the world and the characters; many of the crew are half skaa/half noble and far from planning to save the world out of nobility, plan to do it for the money. Many of the nobles are portrayed as equally at the mercy of others - their squabbles and political manueverings mean less than nothing to the Lord Ruler.    It's clear that Sanderson is trying really hard to find an original take on \\"killing the Evil Overlord and saving the world\\" which is what the plot of this first book revolves around. Sometimes it seems like he's trying a little too hard to be different, but for most of the book it makes for interesting and unexpected reading. The major characters are Kelsier, the charismatic leader of the thieving crew put together to overthrow the Lord Ruler, and Vin, a girl street urchin discovered by Kelsier.    The pacing of the book is very good, with tidbits liberally sprinkled throughout. Just when you think Sanderson's given you the final clue to figure it out the plot twists and you end up thinking \\"brilliant! That makes so much sense - but I had no idea that was coming\\". Which is very hard to do in this day and age after so many themes/plots have been done over and over again.    So if you want to read an internally consistent, engaging and original fantasy then I would highly recommend \\"The Final Empire\\". It's not quite as good as \\"Elantris\\" in my opinion but as it's the first of a series rather than a stand-alone I figure it has room to develop. 4 and a half stars.

B000063DFN|5.0|After purchasing Number of the Beast and really liking it, it was a no brainer that I had to get another album of theirs. With most of the research being done on this website I decided on Powerslave. Wow! I couldn't believe that they could keep up the good infectious beats, but they did. This c.d. has very intriquet song writing, the music it tight in a great way, and Rime of the Ancient Mariner is an epic song lasting over 13 minutes. Powerslave track #7 has a very catchy hook, and the rest of the c.d. is chocked full of excellent guitar work. Although there are only 8 songs the playing time of this album is just shy of the 50 minute mark, so theres plenty to listen to. Another quality effort from a great band. This is a must buy for any Iron Maiden fan.

If they were to re-scan the source material to present it in 16:9 you'd be now stuck with around 400 lines of source resolution and it would be ugly, so either zoom in on it or please hold your tongue...this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />Now for the juice - Chuck Ainlay has gone back to the original master tapes and done an amazing re-mastering of Alchemy as well as an amazing multi-channel surround mix, mastering to 24-bit/96kHz and encoded using the dts Master Audio codec, which is of course lossless.<br /><br />The surround mix is enveloping and accurately reflects the feel of a live concert. Every single nuance of the performance seems to come across with delightful clarity, from the subtleties of Private Investigations to the all out rock and roll of Sultans of Swing. Until now the best I've ever heard Alchemy sound is on the original German vinyl pressing, but I have a new favourite and it is this Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />Whether you kick the lights and TV off and flick your receiver into a PURE DIRECT mode, shut your eyes and float away into this amazing concert or watch it at the same time, this one will be sure to be in constant rotation for a long time to come. Alas this isn't the pristine 1080p24 16:9 35mm transfer that I'm sure people would love to see, but with the elements available I think we're very lucky to finally have such an incredible audio presentation of this truly wonderful performance.<br /><br />Thanks Universal Music and thanks Chuck Ainlay...and of course thanks to Dire Straits, you still rock as hard in 2010 as you did in 1983.
B000006TRV|5.0|I will try to make it short and sweet, Pink Floyd, The Wall is a great album with some very good songs on it. The best in my opinion being on disc 2: Comfortably Numb. This song alone is worth it, I'm a heavy rocker, but even I can appreciate such a well composed song. Comfortably Numb is a song that is probably best experienced with your eyes closed, volume up,and an open mind, because it will give you goose bumps. It is a song to get lost into, I can't explain it, you will just have to listen to it.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Just heard these guys for the first time. They're a good band. Not the most original I've heard, but there's still enough meat on the bone. A lot to listen to, a lot to like. A very close approximation of what P.F. might sound like if they were still together today and firing on all cylinders.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have never liked jazz. I have always found it too off-putting in its improvisional nature; I figured, \\"This stuff is for professional musicians.\\" But I've tried. I've listened to Brubeck, Mann, Getz, and Return to Forever in an attempt to say \\"I like jazz,\\" but just couldn't bring myself to tell that to anyone honestly.    Until I heard \\"Kind of Blue.\\"  I found it at a yard sale for fifty cents (!), thought \\"Oh, why not?\\" and bought it. I have been listening to it obsessively ever since. What it is about this music? It is *very* persuasive.     Best jazz music I have ever heard. I love it!
B002ZG980U|5.0|It's known that, while dreams are thought to be reflections of the subconscious, they follow no logical pattern and cannot be explained in definite terms. What fascinates me endlessly about Christopher Nolan's \\"Inception\\" is that, while he continuously challenges the audience by toying with perceptions of reality, he sets up dreams and dream states under amazingly intricate rules - every action has a name and a function, every image has a label. What the dreamer envisions can be freely manipulated, yet their creations still serve a purpose and follow a definite pattern. Nothing that happens is a random occurrence. It has all been a part of a grand design. It can also be a shared experience. The film is labyrinthine, disorienting, and ceaselessly hypnotic. It weaves through layers of dream and reality (or perhaps it's reality and dream), and rarely if ever is one distinguishable from the other.    Despite heavy psychological subtexts and complex structuring, the general story faithfully adheres to the conventions of a heist movie, with a group of uniquely skilled characters convening for the proverbial Last Job. The protagonist is Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who hacks into other people's dreams in order to steal their ideas. There are a host of qualifiers for making this happen. First, his clients' backgrounds need to be researched; this is where his associate, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), comes in. Second, he needs someone to literally construct the dream into recognizable physical dimensions - an architect, in other words. Third, he needs keep a personal item, or a totem, available at all times, for the way it behaves lets Cobb know whether or not he's still dreaming. His totem is a spinning top. Forth, he needs a special machine to induce all the team players into a sleeping state, since it's possible for more than one person to take part in the same dream.    Cobb is recruited by a powerful billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to infiltrate the dreams of abusiness rival named Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy), who is the heir to his father's fortune. The catch is, Saito doesn't want Cobb to steal any of Fischer's ideas; rather, he wants an entirely new idea planted in Fischer's mind via a process called inception, which is not without risks. Cobb's newly recruited dream architect is college student Aridane (Ellen Page), who shows remarkable talent. He also recruits Eames (Tom Hardy), who, once in a dream state, can shape shift his body and appear to be someone else. Finally, he recruits Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who has developed a special sleeping agent for this particular mission.    One of the film's more interesting plot devices is the ability to go into a dream state even when already in a dream state. Cobb, his team, and Fischer find themselves in not one, but four layers of sleep, each more unstable than the last until at last a raw subconscious limbo is reached. It's also explained that the mind works faster as it goes deeper into dreams, meaning that, with each layer penetrated, time gets progressively slower. What could have been hopelessly confusing is instead an ingenious building of suspense, Nolan successfully keeping tabs on all four dream states as they work towards their own exciting climaxes. None is more exciting than that of the first state, stretched into a nail-biting slow motion shot broken into periodic fragments. This sequence alone is a triumph of film editing.    Cobb is not merely the main character. He's also the story's emotional center, his mind plagued with the image of his wife, Mal (Marion Cottillard), and their two children, who, for reasons I won't reveal, he hasn't seen in a long time. Because of the guilt he feels, he finds that their visions are intruding into other people's dreams, which is not only detrimental to his assignments but also to his own mental health, his ability to do his job rapidly deteriorating. The mysterious nature of the plot prevents us from knowingwith absolute certainty whether she's a dream participant or merely a memory resurfacing from Cobb's subconscious. Yes, it appears to be one way, but as we all know, appearances can be deceiving. What can be said for sure is that Cotillard is one of the film's best assets - the perfect counterpart to DiCaprio's psychologically fractured character.    If the ending doesn't satisfy you ... well, it isn't supposed to be satisfying. It dares the audience to reflect on what may or may not have happened and then come to the best possible conclusion. It's not about closure, nor is it about revealing what's real and what's a dream. It's all about going through a process. Although he has found success with the reinvention of \\"Batman\\" (a franchise I persist in believing he's all wrong for), it's movies like \\"Inception\\" that show Christopher Nolan in top form. Aside from being an engaging and thrilling work of cerebral science fiction, it's a masterpiece of craftsmanship - the screenplay, the character development, the plot, the visual effects, and the performances all handled with precision and care. Nolan truly believed in his idea; if he hadn't, he wouldn't have bothered to work on it for the last ten years.
034547581X|5.0|My goodness, what a moving book.    I have always loved history, especially military history. Up to now I have more or less concentrated on the American Civil War and, occasionally, World War II. This book convinces me that I must do more study of Vietnam since we have so many neglected American HEROES in our midst from that conflict.     Words fail me... we owe these combat veterans so much...    An important book. I can't say that it is excellently written, but it should be widely read.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|LOST Season 6 is disappointing after they had so many great seasons before it.  With the way the storyline turns out in the last one to two seasons, I was almost embarassed to be a fan.  I hate that the producers say that true fans would love this season and the finale, but they lost me once the time traveling started.  Season 1-3 are my faves!!  I own 1-5, but I dont think I am even going to buy this one
B00005QDW5|4.0|In order to fit Mother and Run Like Hell, I would have replaced Echoes from Meddle with Echoes Part 1 from Live in Pompeii. The track is certainly a classic, but a little too long for a Best Of compilation, in my opinion. Besides, the Pompeii version is brilliant.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Every generation has at least one great visionary director whose creative genius transcends their visual craft in a way that defies the conventional norm and is revered by critics and audiences for their originality and brilliance.  Christopher Nolan is, without doubt, this generation's Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, or Orson Welles and will long be remembered among that pantheon as one of the greatest film directors of all time.<br /><br />Inception is the movie that [[ASIN:B001NXBRJG The Matrix]] wanted to be but wasn't and only dreams that it could have been while it was more preoccupied making itself look cool with science fiction technology and special effects, it merely stands upon the precipice of the elaborate canvas of storytelling genius that Nolan presents us here with Inception's intricately complex and labyrinthian narrative as he so masterfully demonstrated in [[ASIN:B000FJGWBM Memento]] (2000) that relies upon virtually no science fiction technology at all, simply the dreams and imagination of its narrative construct.  There is never a dull moment as the viewer's mind is forced to keep up with the expository action racing along like a proverbial freight train.  The special effects are relatively seamless and exist only to support the rich, complicated framework of the story rather than distract from it with gratuitous explosions and an overindulgence of CGI that dominate the morose offerings of modern summer movie blockbusters.  Nolan's visual scope and palette are vast and epic but grounded in a believable and conventional reality, an illusion every bit as effective as the slight-of-hand deception of [[ASIN:B000L212HC The Prestige]] that will leave the viewer questioning what reality really is and which level of reality they are watching long after the film has ended.<br /><br />There are plenty of nods and send-ups to Nolan's favorite films and their influences are evident throughout, the most obvious of which being [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner]] which Nolan is quoted as his biggest inspiration and also [[ASIN:B000LY4J3E On Her Majesty's Secret Service]] which he cited as his favorite James Bond film.  For my money, they should just hand the keys to the Bond franchise over to Nolan right now and let him re-invigorate it with the same sophistication and panache that he brought to the Batman franchise with [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]] and [[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC The Dark Knight]].  Tom Hardy already proved his theatrical range as a serious performer with his breakout performance as [[ASIN:B002XTXFU8 Bronson]] (2009) and delivers an exceptional supporting performance as Eames mixing sly wit with a focused intensity that would be perfect to see him bringing to the role of future James Bond.<br /><br />Although I've never really cared much for Leonardo DiCaprio as a leading actor and have always regarded him as that \\"kid\\" from Titanic but I was completely taken by his emotionally intense performance as Cobb.  Nolan has a knack for casting only the best actors of the highest caliber for his roles and here Leo proves that he is more than a capable leading actor of his generation.  Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine once again bring an heir of class and benediction to their supporting roles as they had done previously in Batman Begins.<br /><br />Hanz Zimmer's intense score for [[ASIN:B003ODL004 Inception]] is extraordinary delivering a lucid electronic ambiance that is both as ethereal as it is urgent, even darker and more melancholy than his score for [[ASIN:B001HXG8PK The Dark Knight (2 CD Special Edition)]].  Zimmer composes an auditory dreamscape that compliments the visual experience of the film by implanting its haunting melody in your mind and staying with you long after you've left the theater.<br /><br />Summer 2010 was looking pretty bleak until Nolan came along and rescued it much like he did in 2008 with The Dark Knight.  All my fears and doubts about howhe was going to top that with the third Batman film have easily been subdued.  I have no doubt in my mind that he will deliver a spectacular finale to his chorus of Batman films with the same sophistication as he has demonstrated in Inception.  The Dark Knight is in good hands.  Now, just let him have the keys to the Astin Martin and let him write his own ticket.  Nolan is the real architect of our dreams.third Batman film have easily been subdued.

1592402690|5.0|Geoff Emerick - A Synaesthetic Genius of Sound at Work on Musical Masterpieces!<br /><br />Geoff Emerick was the \\"Balance Engineer\\" / Sound Recorder / Mixing Desk Console man at EMI's Studios on Abbey Road in London, England who worked on all of The Beatles' records from Revolver till the end. He is a genius! ... The Beatles would absolutely NOT have gotten their records to SOUND as good as they did without him. Before him, their records sounded great - not only because people like George Martin and Norman Smith (their earlier sound man at the controls) were also perfectionists, but because - let's face it - it was The Beatles! They are the greatest band in the world. Their music is majestic, magical, and timeless. Their lyrics, vocal harmonies, and rock energy are \\"second to none!\\" ... But before they got Geoff Emerick as their sound man, their outstanding music was still recorded very conventionally. It was perfect, precise, and pristine! ... After Geoff Emerick came on board (pun intended!), their sound became OUT OF THIS WORLD! It was he, and pretty much he alone, who created their third period \\"psychedelic sound.\\" This was no small feat!<br /><br />Geoff Emerick is a very humble man - but also nobody's fool, and he's an upstanding individual of very high principle. Also, he has a great sense of humor that lets you in on the fact that he never takes himself seriously. But he takes THE WORK at hand VERY seriously! I would trust him with my own sound recordings in a heartbeat! This man cares. ... His approach to sound recording is one of an artist, an enthusiast, and inspired and gifted co-producer of the work in progress. He is organized, detailed, meticulous, responsible, and highly adventurous, experimental, and inventive. He was the perfect man to record the music of The Beatles. It is no wonder that Sir Paul McCartney himself, very early on, saw the value of his character and the quality of his work and befriended him before any of the other Beatles even took notice. Paul is nobody's fool, either! He and Mr. Emerick have had a great working relationship over the years, both before and after The Beatles broke up. Indeed, it is quite clear that they are also very good mates and the dearest of friends. Such shall it ever be!<br /><br />Geoff Emerick himself gives credit to all of the working sound technicians at Abbey Road who helped shape the sound of The Beatles over the years; people like: George Martin, Norman Smith, Richard Lush, Phil MacDonald, Malcolm Davies, Pete Brown, Ken Scott, John Smith, Alan Parsons, Ron Pender, Tony Clark, John Kurlander, and even Glyn Johns (who recorded Get Back, Let It Bleed, and Who's Next - all masterpieces! - at Olympic Recording Studio and / or Twickenham Film Studios). Thankfully, he is not part of the chorus of people with praises for Phil Spector and his tsunamic wall of reverbed, overly echoed sound! Thank God! ... Geoff is not one to pull punches or refrain from telling it like it is. In fact, he's probably one of the few people ever in the world to put The Beatles in their place when they were on their high horses and totally out of line, showing disrespect in the studio for George Martin as well as the other crew at Abbey Road at work on their sessions. Right in the middle of a recording session, he walked out on them! ... He had too much self respect to take their disrespectful attitudes any longer. He stood his ground - and it all worked out very well for him in the ensuing weeks and months and years because of it. I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for this man's character as well as his work ethic - not even to mention his masterful synaesthetic sense of mixing the sound of music! The Beatles were very lucky to have him at the controls.<br /><br />Anyone who knows me knows that I love music more than anything. My first greatest love in the world is playing music live with other people; my second greatest love is creating and composing my own original music, and my third greatest love is recording the music that I and my other musician friends create and perform. Of course, just like anyone else, I love to listen to the music of the greatest artists in the world, like The Beatles, and knowing HOW that music was created in the studio by people like Geoff Emerick who worked together with them and was highly instrumental in helping to shape their sound is not only highly instructional and educational for a person like me who loves to record sound but also extremely enjoyable to say the least. I mean, this man practically, single-handedly created the Yamaha Subkick Bass Drum microphone without even knowing it! That cool bass guitar sound you hear on Paperback Writer and Rain - the first singles released by The Beatles that were recorded by Geoff Emerick - was brought about at Abbey Road by this man! All that weird backwards stuff and the cool sounds that they came up in the studio - especially on Revolver and Pepper - can be attributed to the dedication, hard work, and aesthetic inventiveness of Mr. Emerick. We owe him a great debt!... I would love to work with this man.<br /><br />I loved this book! I mean, I literally ate it up like a ripe avocado! It was juicy and tasty and highly nutritious. If you love The Beatles like I love The Beatles, you're going to love this book. The fact that it focuses on HOW their sound was created is even more enjoyable to a person like me. I could care less what color shirt John Lennon is wearing or what he and Yoko were up to while the other Beatles were starting to record the Abbey Road album. What I really care about is exactly WHAT was going on in the STUDIO when they were recording their music and HOW it all came about. If you're like me, this is the book for you! It's all there - down to who was holding what pencil on what tape machine to line the recorders up for those special songs we all know and love that we have heard on the radio countless times since they were first released. I mean, this is the holy grail. We've all read books and books about The Beatles over the years, but this is the first - if not the only - one that takes you right there into the studio and behind the control room glass and reveals EXACTLY what was going on and HOW it was recorded. It's amazing and excitingly satisfying - to say the least - for anyone interested in knowing the way that The Beatles went about creating and recording their music. Masterful!<br /><br />I love what Mr. Emerick wrote here on page 117:<br /><br />\\"I'm not a huge fan of any of the Beatles CD releases - their songs were recorded with the intention of being released on vinyl, and as far as I am concerned, that is the way they should be heard. But the \\"Paperback Writer\\" / \\"Rain\\" single sounds exceptionally good on vinyl, not the least of which because Tony Clark was able to use a brand-new piece of gear when mastering it - a huge monstrosity developed by our maintenance department that had blinking lights everywhere. It was called \\"ATOC,\\" short for \\"Automatic Transient Overload Control,\\" and it allowed for the record to be cut louder than any other single up to that time. Unfortunately, the stereo mix of \\"Paperback Writer\\" does the song no justice. It's completely disjointed, and it isn't at all the balance that we intended. To me, the mono mix is much more exciting.<br /><br />Another distinctive aspect of \\"Paperback Writer\\" is the fluttering echo at the end of each chorus, added at the mix stage. It was accomplished by routing the vocals into a separate two-track machine and then connecting that machine's output to its input. At the end of each chorus, Phil had the job of slowly increasing the record level until it just reached the point of feedback. If he went one notch too far, the echo would get out of control, so there were many attempts at doing the mix. Every time he'd go past that point, or not far enough, we'd have to stop and remix the entire song again. That's because, in the archaic EMI way of thinking, edits were frowned upon. Management didn't want anyone taking a razor to master tapes, so multitrack editing - which would allow us to join the start of one take onto the end of another - was rarely allowed in those days. Even during mixing, editing was discouraged, although it would have allowed us to create a mix in sections - something that was commonly done in most other recording studios. Somehow EMI just didn't care what was going on in the outside world: we'd have to get the mix right from the start to finish. If we messed up in the middle, or even if the very end of the fadeout wasn't quite right, we would have to start all over again; we couldn't just edit in a replacement for a bad bit. As a result, you got that adrenaline going, and the mixes themselves became performances.<br /> We may have had to do things the hard way, but it also meant we had to put in the effort to get it right. Looking at it that way always made me feel a bit better about the long hours involved.\\"<br /><br />See what I mean? ... Geoff and his co-workers took pains in every respect, day after day, year after year, to get it right. The Beatles' music benefitted by this, for sure. ... Now as for music on CD, or analog versus digital, or PCM versus 1-Bitstream, or even Mono versus Stereo for that matter, it still boggles me to this day why The Beatles did not insist upon EMI and Parlophone and Capitol Records to release their recently re-mastered recordings just like Neil Young did - in 4 formats: on vinyl, on CD (44.1 kHz / 16 Bit), on DVD (96 kHz / 24 BIT), and on Blu-ray (192 kHz / 24 Bit). I mean, this is The Beatles - the greatest band in the world. If you're going to re-master and re-release all of their music to the world, then you should release it in the highest form of audiophile quality available. As for Mono verses Stereo, I agree with Mr. Emerick - the MONO releases (Get that little White Box while they last!) - are the ones intended to be heard. Those were the mixes that were considered the state-of-the-art, quintessential, archetypal Beatle records for people to hear. Stereo is cool - and we all love it (I love Surround Sound even more!) - but The Beatles music was originally meant to released in MONO - and so that is the way they should be heard, at least up till The White Album. As for analog versus digital, I think if you heard The Beatles on Blu-ray - in Mono OR in Stereo - it would blow your mind! So, why not do it? They've already re-mastered all of the music at 192 kHz / 24 Bit, so why not let us hear it that way, instead of listening to the, obviously, inferior sonic quality of CD's, with their limited dynamic range and lower sampling rate that means the detail and high end is not captured as close to the original, analog masters as could be with Blu-ray? ... Come on, you guys! ... It's The Beatles for God's sake!<br /><br />I could quote so many great lines and passages from this book about The Beatles, it's not funny! I took 15 pages worth of notes, with 378 separate entries - and I am really tempted to go on and make this review even longer than usual (because you know me, I like to write and could go on forever), but I will leave you with this very touching and heartfelt passage of Mr. Emerick's from page 369 at the end of the book - and you'll have to read the whole book yourself to get to all of the really good stuff that is here on, literally, every page:<br /><br />\\"I still love the art of recording just as much as I did when I was a teenager, but the process is simply not as much fun as it was in those days. Then, it took a team of people to get the sounds right and play the parts correctly. But walk into any studio now and all you'll see is someone staring at a computer screen, moving a mouse, cutting, copying, and pasting as if they were doing a spreadsheet: everything is just too clinical. The Beatles were constantly in search of perfection, it's true, but they were looking for the perfect way to convey a feeling, not technical perfection, which seems to be the goal of many of today's records. If someone made a tiny mistake or sang something a little funny in a Beatles session, it would generally be left in if it was felt it added to the character of the record. Sometimes we'd even accentuate the mistakes during mixing, just to underline the fact that the music was being made by fallible beings.

Though I no longer use my good old 4-track analog magnetic tape recorder and use a digital multi-track recorder instead, I do not use a computer. Music was meant to be heard, not seen - which is one reason why a lot of these recording sessions at Abbey Road were done late at night, with minimal light, maybe the glow of a lava lamp and the mixing board level lights while The Beatles were out in the studio in almost complete darkness. ...

And the best musicians in the world know this. You need to FEEL the music and hear it with your whole body - not just with your eyes! ... God bless Geoff Emerick for his golden ears, his warm heart, his keen mind, and his true sense of musicianship.

And the best musicians in the world know this. You need to FEEL the music and hear it with your whole body - not just with your eyes! ... God bless Geoff Emerick for his golden ears, his warm heart, his keen mind, and his true sense of musicianship. May people with the same attitude and outlook toward music as him be the ones to pick up the torch and carry it forth into the future of recorded sound! ...

030726999X|5.0|Keys to a great novel:  Good story and great character development.<br />The fundamental keys to a great novel are a really good story and great characters.  Stieg Larsson's Swedish trilogy concerning the life of a rather \\"interesting\\" woman, Lisbeth Salander, and the mysterious inner workings of the Swedish government makes for one terrific read.  Mr. Larsson's The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the final installment of this trilogy.  Like the two novels before it, this final book continues to break new ground surrounding the characters and the continuing intricate story.  Mr. Larsson opens his final novel with Lisbeth in the hospital recovering from multiple gunshot wounds she received at the conclusion of The Girl Who Played with Fire.  The intrepid journalist Mikael Blomkvist is back along with all the rest of the \\"usual suspects\\".  Mr. Larsson continues to develop his complex trilogy of love, hate, espionage, lies, personal foibles, and who-done-it mysterious actions.  Somehow Mr. Larsson is able to cram a huge amount of story, and lots of interesting character in a sprawling novel that gets more interesting with each page.<br /><br />Like his preceding novels in this trilogy, the only downside is the first 50 pages.  Be advised, the reader needs to slog through those as Mr. Larrson sets his literary table.  Then as if by magic the story explodes and the reader is catapulted into another Larsson thrill ride.  Even though the story gets a little dense at times Mr. Larsson keeps it moving.  Just plug through the opening pages and you will be well rewarded.<br /><br />Mr. Larsson's trilogy is a character rich environment.  Superb character development in all respects.  By this third novel of the \\"The Girl\\" trilogy the reader is well acquainted with all the major players but Mr. Larsson is not done as he introduces new characters to add to the richness and depth of the basic story.  The entire trilogy is a tapestry of interesting characters with their own unique sub plots and personal interactions.  Mr. Larsson has an amazing literary ability to develop so many interesting characters in a single story.  He is truly a master of character development.  The trial scene and the dramatic conclusion(s) were absolutely riveting.<br />A complete mix of sex, graphic violence and intense language but all done in an artful way--not the least bit gratuitous--and very germane to the trilogy's main thesis.  A hauntingly masterful novel.<br /><br />Must read.  BUT, be advised to get the full effect of Mr. Larsson's trilogy you should read the 3 books in order.  The first two are now out in paperback so if you have not read them I would highly recommend that you do so.  Mr. Larsson does a fairly good job of setting the table with past references, but to be frank, you will get lost with all the characters (Swedish names) if you have not read the previous works.  Mr. Larsson was a master storyteller of the first order.  His plots and sub-plots are intricate, his dialog is terrific, but his intense character development at all levels will make this trilogy a classic for years to  come.  Read and enjoy a master.

0307454541|2.0|The original Swedish title translates to 'Men who hate women'. I would never had bought (or read) a book with that title. The subject was disturbing. The translation was terrible (here I'm assuming that a native Swedish speaker translated it into English). Absolutely NOT worth the hype. Stieg Larsson's estate has an excellent marketing team behind him to have duped 30 million readers. Me included. I will definitely not read the rest of the series.
B003NX76BM|4.0|I adore Nora Roberts and I read everything she writes; 99% of the time she hits it out of the park. This time it was an inside home run. Loved the story and the book but as other readers commented, it was a slow read. I thought she could have made the plot more intense but it probably would have offended a lot of people. I loved the S and R sequences and it provided a lot of information on how they work - kudos! The rescue of the little boy in the opener was great! The dogs were adorable and I loved that she gave their expressions words.     The interaction between Fiona and Simon was cute and funny. They made a great team and you knew he would always be there for her.     My biggest disappointment was in the ending, it was kind of flat to me. I was expecting more. All in all though, it was a great book.
0805091742|4.0|The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right by Atul Gawande is a book I'd heard about a number of months ago and meant to read long before now.  But a long hold list at the library and then a messed-up checkout (that put me at the end of the long list again!) conspired against me until now.  The main gist of the book is that the rigorous use of the lowly checklist can radically improve your chances of getting the correct outcome of a job or task, even if that task is highly complex.  Gawande applied the checklist methodology to his job as a surgeon, not expecting it to have much of an impact on results.  But to his surprise, using a checklist had a direct impact on the rate of errors on nearly a daily basis.  And in one dramatic case, it even saved a patient's life.<br /><br />Contents:<br />The Problem of Extreme Complexity; The Checklist; The End of the Master Builder; The Idea; The First Try; The Checklist Factory; The Test; The Hero in the Age of Checklists; The Save; Notes on Sources; Acknowledgments<br /><br />Gawande's personal experience with learning to use checklists comes from an engagement with the World Health Organization.  He was tasked to find a way to reduce the risk of surgeries on a worldwide basis, as indications were that the volume of surgeries were increasing along with negative outcomes.  To complicate matters, these improvements had to be applicable across the complete spectrum of hospitals and facilities, from well-funded research hospitals to small understaffed clinics in third world countries with no supplies.  And you thought *your* latest project was impossible?  After hearing from a number of doctors, patients, and other people with a stake in the project, the group came up with the idea that a checklist might be the answer.  Given the typical view that the doctor is God when it comes to health care, recommending something so mechanical and simplistic didn't meet with overwhelming enthusiasm.  But as Gawande illustrates with various stories and documentation, the checklist actually did have a dramatic impact on outcomes, causing all the members of the surgical team to share information and root out assumptions and misinformation *before* it was too late.  Gawande also covers the use of checklists in both the building trade and in the daily life of aircraft pilots.  By eliminating the idea that one person can know and understand everything, the checklist becomes the single tool that allows everyone to take the proper steps that are proven to work or ensure that the proper safeguards are in place to handle any risks or emergencies.<br /><br />While the book is heavy on narrative and proof that checklists work across a number of trades and industries, it seems rather light on the details of checklist creation and methodology.  There are suggestions and recommendations along the way (no more than one page, somewhere between five and nine items, etc.), but they are scattered in the different stories and narratives.  There are also no examples of checklists that have worked well for specific situations.  Granted, a surgical checklist won't be applicable to me as a software developer, nor would a pre-flight checklist be of any use to a builder.  But seeing actual checklist examples to back up recommendations scattered throughout the book would have helped, in my opinion.  Basically, there's no single chapter you can go to that summarizes what a good checklist should be, how it should be used, and what to keep in mind when writing one.  A chapter like that would have made this an excellent book for both learning and reference.<br /><br />Even with my reservations about the lack of a consolidating chapter, The Checklist Manifesto is still an important book to read and understand.  It's started me thinking beyond my current practice of doing things from memory (and often forgetting one or more steps or checkpoints), and I can see how using checklists as a regular part of one's job could lead to a definite improvement in how things turn out.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Do you remember how you arrived where are you?  Does your staircase reach its end?  Are your carpet fibers exactly as they were the last time you ran your hand across them?  Such is the stuff dreams are made of--an encyclopedia of minutiae and desultory impressions that we collect, synthesize, and construct into \\"reality,\\" or so we think...  If perception is reality, than dreams are as real as we believe them to be.  Real enough that one might forget what is real, and then forget to have forgotten.  What, then, is a dream if not an absence of remembering?      Christopher Nolan's film is a two-and-a-half hour exegesis on this topic.  It's premise is that dreams can be infiltrated, that thoughts can be stolen, that inspiration can be implanted.  The plot could be summarized in a paragraph, but why bother.  What makes this movie so fun is not the plot, but the experience.  It takes you by the hand and pulls you into a cyclone of sensory indulgence.  Some of the scenes will have you breathing through your mouth.  It will confuse, baffle, and mystify you, and if you believe that you are beginning to understand, you must have just forgotten that that you're not.
B000062XFG|5.0|Season 2 is one enjoyable season of shows.  When TNG started I wasn't sure I would like it.  Picard is no Captain Kirk.  And I thought there would never be another relationship such as the one between Spock and McCoy. But I grew to love TNG, as much as, if not more than TOS.  And this season has some dramatic shows as well as some funny episodes.  Up the Long Ladder is one of my favorite humorus episodes.  The episode where Data and Geordi visit the holodeck as Holmes and Watson is both funny and dramatic.  The temporary addition of Dr. Pulaski to replace Dr. Crushers character was hard to get used to.  Pulaski doesn't have the warm, friendly disposition that Crusher does.  But she grew on me a little as the season progressed.  I would definitely recommend getting this season.  I think the actors were defining their characters in season 1.  This season, they are more defined and more interesting.  Enjoy it.

B001152TL6|4.0|Lost Highway is a movie that allows you to make a choice. Is it a Twilight Zone Movie in which you're dealing with soul transference & time travel? Could be? A Faustian bargain? Are you dealing with the roving inner eye of an insane mind? That was my choice & this review will reflect that choice.<br /><br />The movie starts with a man & his wife whose house is being video taped from the inside. Is this being done by an outsider, evil spirit or is this the act of a sinister plan inside the home? I say inside job. If you're messed up enough to shoot video of your place to deceive yourself or your mate, putting it in an envelope & leaving it outside is no biggee.<br /><br />What a lovely relationship they have too. He's freaked out & she's subservient enough but also obviously has the quiet confidence to plan her way through her troubles. Enter now, the best character of the movie only listed as \\"mystery man\\", Robert Blake. He's never gone anywhere he states, that he wasn't invited. Sounds like an evil spirit all right & remember they've talked before. In my book they've talked many times, like each night as Pullman roves the corridors of his insane & escape proof mind.<br /><br />You get a murder, an arrest & a conviction. So neat & tidy plus added stress on an already bent mind. What happens in Pullman's cell at night is the key to whether you go towards Twilight Zone or insanity. Is Bill Pullman & Balthazar Getty the same man? Is Pullman actually in prison or is he in the prison for the criminally insane with a real body played by Getty.<br /><br />I chose Balthazar Getty as the real & very, very, sick, person in this movie. Pullman is Getty's uber-human. Pullman is what Getty wants to be. Not an auto mechanic that lives at home with mommy & daddy, BTW- great cameo's here on ma & pa, but a musician in a nice apartment with a super hot lady that belongs to one of the BIG people in his little man's world. I mean Getty covets everything he perceives as being above his station in life, the car, the women & in the end the will to be violent to obtain his desires.<br /><br />Now for the lady, & thank you Mr. Lynch for Patricia. This girl wants the money & there is nothing she won't do to get it. Attracted to power like a drunk to alcohol she has finally realized that if she has the money she can be the power, not bask in someone else's. Now look at how they meet. She did sorta make the pick herself. She picked that punk as soon as she saw he couldn't take his eyes off her while she was still in the car. Lamb to the slaughter she thinks, but this isn't Body Heat even though Patricia puts out tons of that.<br /><br />Actually I believe the movie is pretty straight forward once you decide if you're watching Rod Serling's Twilight Zone or if you're seeing inside the mind of a little man with big dreams that went terribly awry & landed him in the prison we can't escape, our own minds.<br /><br />The men's dreams are trashed. The woman's dreams are killed. Even the Big Boss is pancaked out of his dream in the desert. The only winner here is \\"Mystery Man\\" who never goes where he's not invited. Where does Mystery Man come from & where does he go to? Whose call does he answer? Isn't it to be expected that as the police close in for the capture, no O J here, Mr. Getty begins to revert back to his other identity. Sorta like Psycho without the maternal leanings so no insipid weakness.<br /><br />I give the movie 5 stars for entertainment value as you can get sucked in here and wake up 2 hr's later thinking only 25 min's passed. Lot's of misdirection.<br />I give Patricia anything she wants. I'll be Getty for her.<br />The rest of the cast gets 4 stars except Blake who gets 5.<br />Movie rating is 4 1/2 stars.<br />A nice trip down the lost highway of my mind.<br /><br />Private rant here: Where the H was the media circus that would have surrounded Getty's release from prison. Seems Hollywood either toons the Warden, the guards, the convicts, the media or the whole system. This show used the other method which is- just don't show it.don't show it.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I saw Inception on opening day in my town. I think that the first thing I heard as the credits started rolling sums up the experience: \\"what the heck?\\"<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom, an expert at getting inside of peoples' minds (through dreaming) and stealing their secrets (known as extraction). He has a team who help him with this, and his clients are often leaders of some of the largest and wealthiest corporations on Earth. Ken Wanatabe plays one of those leaders. But what he wants isn't an extraction, it's an inception, in which an idea is planted in the subconscious of the targeted person. Some on the team say it can't be done, but Dom moves the team forward on this mission--despite the incredible danger it holds for them all.<br /><br />Inception plays with space, time and matter in ways we've never seen before. It is not science fiction in the way of spaceships and alien creatures, but of the mind and its incredible powers. The visual effects are quite amazing, especially when the world is turned upside down (or sideways). The action in the film is quite intense and some sequences had people in the theatre with me on the edge of their seats--quite literally! One toward the end especially is a real mind-blower (in more ways than one).<br /><br />My complaint is that the concept and the story are so complex that, even with total concentration on the screen, I found it difficult to keep up with what was going on. I know I wasn't the only one in this situation, because I heard a lot of murmuring among the packed crowd to the tune of \\"What just happened?\\" Several few people got up and left as I think they just gave up on trying to \\"get it.\\" Additionally, most of the characters were not fleshed out--all the \\"character time\\" was devoted to Dom's character.<br /><br />If being totally dazed and confused sounds like mad fun to you, then this is definitely your film. If it all sounds like too much work, then you may want to pick another movie. If you're in between, definitely give it a shot on DVD.<br /><br />I liked it...I really enjoyed the effects, the action and most of the puzzle...but didn't LOVE it. 4 1/2 stars.ween, definitely give it a shot on DVD.<br /><br />I liked it...I really enjoyed the effects, the action and most of the puzzle...but didn't LOVE it. 4 1/2 stars.
0316044938|4.0|Death. We all think about it. We all experience it second hand at one point. And we will all go through it. We all hope that it will come when we are old and wrinkly and to the point that we accept it. We do not wish that it would be taken from us, brutally, when we are young. Susie Salmon had that same wish.<br /><br />Susie was only fourteen when she was raped and murdered by a neighbor, Mr. Harvey. But this book is not all about her death and who did it and how it happened. We find out right in the beginning. This novel is about how Susie's death was just a pebble in the pond.<br /><br />Alice Sebold takes on the lives of everyone around Susie Salmon. From family, to crushes, to her friends she had and the friends she never knew she had. The way Sebold writes out what happens to each of them, makes us feel as if we are living with them. As if, like Susie, we are looking down upon them from heaven. The heaven that is the most perfect place. Not hers, but also, our perfect world.<br /><br />We see a family that was as close as any can be, break up into separate paths. Friendships formed that would have otherwise been left untouched. They all share her death. But, Susie shows us that death is not something to be feared. It is something that should be welcomed when the time comes.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this novel, but it is one of those books that when someone reads it, everyone see's something different. And I could go on and on for hours. But, I'd rather have you read it and experience the pain and joy for yourselves. Because as we all know; Death, is but another great adventure
B000002OTL|5.0|Opening with the iconic licks of Dick Dale & The Del-Tones' \\"Miserlou\\" -- which, for all intents and purposes, should be renamed to \\"Theme from Pulp Fiction\\" at this point -- the soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino's break-through feature film, \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" is as much of a cult favorite as the film itself. Not just a hodge-podge of songs that play like a major record label executive's mixtape, this collection was carefully hand-picked and assembled by Tarantino himself, and like the stories that interweave throughout his film, are eclectic, contrasting, and quirky and yet, find a place amongst one another.<br /><br />Whether it's Al Green's \\"Let's Stay Together\\" or Dusty Springfield's \\"Son of a Preacher Man,\\" each and every track is as good as the last -- a rare occasion for a motion picture soundtrack. Urge Overkill's take on Neil Diamond's \\"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon\\" is a highlight among many, as not only does it outdo its original in just about every capacity, but sets the stage for Uma Thurman's drug-induced adventure within the film. Maria McKee's \\"If Love is a Red Dress\\" is one of the more stripped down and straight-forward tunes of the bunch, sharply contrasting the near tongue-in-cheek inclusion of Kool & The Gang's \\"Jungle Boogie,\\" which the film would seem somehow incomplete without. Injected between these songs are choice pieces of dialog from the film that help some of the chunkier transitions from song to song flow a bit more naturally.<br /><br />Complete from front to back, \\"Pulp Fiction\\" is without a doubt the most memorable soundtrack of the 90's, and certainly among the best that has ever been assembled, period. Even without visions of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson running through your head, the set stands strongly on its own. Simply put: You don't even have to have enjoyed the movie or even seen it, for that matter, to appreciate its soundtrack, which in and of itself is a massive achievement for Tarantino.

0783225903|5.0|To label `Brazil' a masterpiece seems almost clich&eacute;.  To say that it is brilliant seems almost like a lazy cop-out.  Standing back and reflecting on the film as a living entity, there seems to be something almost entirely alien about it, as if it were a specious all its own.  There is nothing like it, yet it bleeds familiarities that make it almost comforting to the eyes.  While under its spell I must say that I found myself fascinated, the entire time drawing comparisons to other more commercially acceptable work (this film, for me, feels like what would have happened if The Coen brothers rewrote `V for Vendetta' in the vein of a 40's film noir with `The Fifth Element' close in mind).  With the smoke cleared though, this films complexion reads something entirely its own; something I have never seen before and may never see again.<br /><br />I am not an expert on director Terry Gilliam's work, but the four films I've seen of his (`Monty Python and the Holy Grail', `Brazil', `The Fisher King' & '12 Monkeys') are sheer brilliance in their respective genre's, all of which proving him to be not simply a mere film director but a visionary, an auteur much as the same way that Michael Haneke or Lars von Trier are auteurs.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam is a storyteller, not a mere movie-maker.<br /><br />`Brazil' tells the complex story of a man named Sam Lowry who works for an intelligence agency working to fight terrorism.  When a mistake costs an innocent man his life, Lowry finds himself trapped in the center of government cover-up; something that he seems almost naïve to.  When he falls in love (through his constant day-dreaming) with a belligerent woman seeking justice, his life spirals out of control as he is forced to recognize the condition of his own country, something he has feigned ignorance to for so long.<br /><br />The world that Gilliam creates here is one that is an obvious satirical exaggeration of modern society, at times even more appropriate today than it was twenty-five years ago.<br /><br />`Brazil' is not a commercial film, not an easily accessible film to say the least.  It is not something you can switch off your brain to and then appreciate, understand or enjoy.  `Brazil' is a film that you need to absorb in order to grasp its complexities, but it is well worth the extra brain-power used to understand it.  With gripping performances (especially by Jonathan Pryce) as well as a slew of supporting roles by some heavy hitters (Robert De Niro, Ian Holm and Bob Hoskins), `Brazil' has it all.  The sets may be dated, and the overall conceptual outlook of a futuristic metropolis may seem old-fashioned, but the way that Gilliam weaves his tale makes up for any minor details.<br /><br />I promise you this; `Brazil is unlike anything you've ever experienced before.`Brazil' is not a commercial film, not an easily accessible film to say the least.

0385504225|3.0|First of all, I would like to say that Dan Brown is a fun writer. I define a fun writer, as someone, who understands that chapters don't have to be 30 pages long. His are three to five pages. Spare me the waste of space argument, especially when you read the book on a Kindle/iPad, the space is free. I don't read any fiction anymore but I do like Dan Brown's past books enough to pick up the next copy every 3 to 5 years. And Dan Brown's contributions in fiction, have had an incredibly powerful affect on people; they make you question words/institutions and stimulate personal research, even if people know that parts of the underlying ideas of the book are askew for spinning a good yarn.<br /><br />Having said that, even with the backdrop being changed from the Catholic Church to the Freemasons, the Lost Symbol and Robert Langdon have tired me out. After hearing St. Langdon, say \\"I must help Peter or Katherine\\" more than 20 times, I thought I was going to puke.<br /><br />Also there are so many obvious red herrings in the Lost Symbol - even though we have come a long way in the U.S. from stereotyping - Dan Brown is not going to stick his neck out and have a Japanese American and/or an African American be bad apples.<br /><br />Were you surprised that the antagonist was Peter's real son? I didn't. After Brown spent so many pages going out of his way, to make the disconnect between the two in prison, I could feel myself wanted to shout \\"will you please stop, I get it, thanks for ruining it\\".<br /><br />Finally, and this is not just Dan Brown, but every writer of a thriller, builds up the story line, so that, the ending is a let down. His ending in Lost Symbol was especially disappointing. We went on a long treasure hunt, and ended up with \\"light\\" (I get the metaphor) shining off buildings at dawn as our reward?<br /><br />In my 40+ years of reading thrillers, and I don't think I am alone, there has only been one surprise ending. That was Presumed Innocent. But I hate to even mention the lawyer/author. That is because the rest of his books have not only stunk, but they don't sound like the author. I live in Chicago and the author lives in Chicago. My own suspicion is that one of his clients could not pay his/her bill and assigned him the copyright of a manuscript instead.<br /><br />All fiction writers start to get stale. Nelson DeMille was on his game for 20 years and he lost it in the 2000s. I think Dan Brown needs to think about saying good-bye to Robert Langdon. Hopefully that will make his next book more enjoyable. But who am I to tell him that. If he announced another Langdon-based book in 2012 - 2015, I am sure his sales would be just as strong sans at least one tired Chicago reader.because the rest of his books have not only stunk, but they don't sound like the author.

0515141429|4.0|This was my first book about Jack Reacher.  He's a fascinating protagonist.  I've already bought another book!  Childs' description of action scenes is fantastic.  It's terse but vivid - perfect for fight/kill scenes, where everything has to be fast.      My only complaint was that my copy of the paperback has a cover image which basically gives away the story (no, not the bloody handprint), and blurbs from other authors that do the same!  It's a big book and I'd rather not know what it's about 200 pages ahead!
B0000046JP|3.0|This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.
1892005034|5.0|This is a wonderful book if you are ready to make some fundamental changes for your own good. It is more than about how you talk. It is how you think of yourself and others. It took me a while to actually pick it up after a friend recommended to me. And I am so thankful that I did! I started out by changing one thing that I tend to do that hurt myself, and subtly the world around me changes with it. I am a happier person because of this book.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Just got back form the movie theater and had to write this.  INCEPTION is the movie to see this year.  Chris Nolan's film draws you in and never let's you go.  Yes the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, but you don't notice it.  It is definitely a movie not only would I see it again, I will buy on Blue-ray.  Great action scenes, special effects, and cast.  Enjoy the best movie this summer.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I am a newcomer to Seinfeld. I knew the basic concept of the show but never watched episodes. Not only is the show impressive, so is this DVD set. Seinfeld really is \\"the show about nothing\\", if you're looking for sophisticated humor this isn't it. If that's your type of thing, you should definitely watch Frasier. Even though this DVD set includes season one and season two, there are only eighteen episodes. But the DVD makes up for that with very informative extras which I'll discuss later in my review. I love how the simplest problem could become bigger and bigger as the episode goes on. It's just so entertaining and the cast do an excellent job in my opinion. One of my favorite episodes was from season one entitled \\"the Baby Shower.\\" But it's hard to describe my favorite part because there are three subplots for Jerry, Elaine and George. And that's another thing, many times the whole episode feels like a subplot but each subplot is combined together brilliantly which makes for fantastic viewing.<br /><br />The bonus features are some of the best I've seen for a show on DVD, there are just so many. But fortunately it doesn't get confusing finding the one you want. When you select what episode you want to watch on the episode menu, another menu pops up which also lets you select the bonus feature you want to watch that's made for that episode. But if you just want to watch all the extras at once, there is an extras menu which has them all listed there as well. Speaking of extras, here are what the usual extras are for this set. There are audio commentaries with the cast, writers, and creator Larry David, also included with each episode are production notes which will pop up every once in a while, there informative but they can get distracting after a while. There also is a five minute segment featured for most of the episodes called the \\"Inside Look\\", which just briefly discusses the episodes plot, and filming it, these are very interesting. The rest are bloopers, promos, some old, hard to find Jerry Seinfeld stand-up footage and an hour long documentary on how Seinfeld was created. In all, just a ton of fantastic interesting bonus features that I'm sure you'll enjoy.<br /><br />Each disc is placed in a separate slim case and the discs episode descriptions and extras are featured on the back. Down below I'll list season one and two's episode descriptions. Just saying, on the DVD the episodes are listed by production number, I'm listing them by their original airdate. \\"The Stranded\\" (Included on this set) was first aired in season three.<br /><br />The Seinfeld Chronicles (Pilot) - Airdate: 7/5/1989 - Jerry is excited that a woman he met on the road is coming to visit him in New York.

B00180R06I|5.0|Carl Dreyer's 'Vampyr' is a testament to the way in which cinema has basically lost its' intangible capacity to cut across our our most banal expectations. This brief film is a tour-de-force of technical virtuosity-I particularly like the shots from inside the coffin. Of course, no one today is going to appreciate this little beauty for its horror-after all there's no 'camp' or shock value, merely the subtle accumulation of shadow and subtle eroticism. There are also truly revolutionary transgressions of point of view and continuity which render this masterpiece an eternally perplexing and interesting visual accomplishment.
B002ZG981E|4.0|Having more certainty of Christopher Nolan's originality than his film's absolute cohesion, I really wish there might have been some way to approach this material as a trilogy because there is simply TOO much to establish in a single-sitting.  So much of the dialogue is so heavily leaden with exposition that it was difficult to actually connect with the characters speaking it.  There were so many characters to introduce that there was little or no time to actually develop them.  And, most troubling, there was NEVER any explanation as to HOW one actually enters someone else's dream, and THAT was something that NEEDED to be explained!  Were the characters in someway psionic or did the little machine they carried in a briefcase do all of that for them?  Had this been a trilogy, then maybe some of these issues could have been explained as courageously as they were executed.  Inception is a good movie, but had the concept REALLY been hammered-out in advance it could have been a cornerstone in cinema history!<br /><br />I find myself still wondering about the true motives of Saito. The target within whom he has hired Dom Cobb's team to implant a self-destructive yet compelling notion never once showed even the faintest hint of the ruthless aggression that Saito, himself, routinely displays. One wonders if Saito's true motives were to delve deep into the psyche of Cobb rather than that of his announced target. And, to complicate matters even further, just why is Ariadne so insistent on being on Cobb's infiltration team? Was the real person she was trying to lead out of the labyrinth Saito rather than Cobb? She was, afterall, recommended by Cobb's father-in-law; what reason would HE have to believe his son-in-law innocent of his daughter's death when every authority who investigated the case believes him guilty?<br /><br />When I began asking myself these and other questions, I began to get the sense that Cobb's point-of-view may be no more reliable than Leonard's in Memento. I cannot help but wonder if Cobb's mind was the actual target for infiltration in order to bring HIM to justice for the death/murder of his wife.  What better way to assess his state of mind than to personally witness his very own memories of these events?<br /><br />In any case, if you enjoy thought-provoking art that raises more questions than it answers, then Inception is definitely a film worthy of an evening at the theater. It allows the demons that haunt the protagonist, and quite possibly other characters as well, to manifest in ways so consistent with the film medium that I wonder if this story would even work if presented in a purely written way. Subjective doesn't even begin to describe this film; there is almost no way one can spoil this story by droping a tid bit here or a tid bit unless you insist on taking said tid bit at absolute face value. The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that NOTHING in this film can be taken at face value!p but wonder if Cobb's mind was the actual target for infiltration in order to bring HIM to justice for the death/murder of his wife.

0060531053|5.0|When I first started thinking about making my own homebrew I had asked a friend who is a doctor in the field of chemical engineering.  He told me to pick up this book and read it through and let the brewing begin.  I did just that and it opened pandora's box so to say.  I have been homebrewing ever since and this book had been the biggest inspiration to get me going.  It was full of information that the first time brewer would have never even thought about.  So now a couple years later I'm still working at my brewing skills by extract brewing but I'm begining to work toward all grain.  Bottom line great book and I would recommend it to all first time homebrewers!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|This toy is delightful and my 5 month old baby adores it. She laughs and becomes excited whenever I put the toy next to her. It also prevents her from throwing a fit during tummy time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
0307460444|5.0|This is a great cupcake book.  Not only does it have cupcake and frosting recipes, it also includes decorating ideas-from elegant to whimsical.  Lots of pictures (every recipe)!!!!
0142412147|3.0|This book was captivating, funny, and entertaining...for one third of the time I was reading it.    While John Green's story was very strong, I found that Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson did not pull their own weight. I am not familiar with Myracle's work, but I guess I should have expected Johnson's weaker story as I have been unimpressed by her writing before. Their two stories weren't awful, but they weren't brilliant either. Green, as usual, produced a great story with believable characters in a witty style. His story carries the anthology. I was so impressed with it that I would recommend this book for John Green's story alone.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|All hail the return of the disco diva.Kylie returns to the disco dancefloor with her best collection of dance music since her album \\"Light Years\\".This album will get your feet moving and your body shaking.It'll put a smile on your face and make your heart skip a beat.This album does not disappoint and I believe any fan of dance music will enjoy every second of it.Thank you Queen Kylie,for blessing your loyal subjects with this delightful collection.
B003AOAXGE|5.0|Fantastic, subtle animated performances, gorgeous production design. Highly recommend to any fan of stop motion animation, character or production design.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Aurally this is far from the best of Bruce, but it's a visual treat and gives you the real Springsteen concert experience.  The quality of both visuals and sound is terrific, and the Boss is his usual entertaining ringmaster self.  For anyone who's never been to an E-Street show, it will be a revelation; for the rest of us it's a pure-pleasure reminder of the exhiliration that defines a Springsteen concert.    Bruce's voice is very hoarse and quite weak through the whole thing, and Patti is disappointingly missing, but I haven't heard Stevie so strong in a long time, and, as is always apparent in concert, Max is as mighty as ever.  Nils has plenty of energy and Clarence's sax still rules, so even in their 60s the E-Street boys give us a show well worth watching. I don't think you have to be Springsteen-obsessed to love this, but I have to admit, I wouldn't actually know about that!
B003PGNBO8|5.0|1----\\"Flashforward\\" is great because the characters are so well written that one cares about them. What is Lita going to do to Janis?  If the whole blackout thing is being planned by Jericho, what is their purpose? Apparently Dyson Frost and Nhadra Udaya were on one side and Hellinger and Alda were on opposite sides--why? There was some mention of some terrible event that ends the world in 2015--is Jericho attempting to use the blackouts to prevent the end at whatever cost? In Somalia during 1991 a little boy looks up and sees a cloud, it looks like a Klingon spaceship in that cloud to me.  What is it that he sees? And will Tracey and Aaron survive?  2----The plot holds together and keeps one sitting on the edge of our seats. So I feel that the people who enjoyed Lost will enjoy Flashforward too.  3----The characters change with the situations they are in.  Mark Benford's character changes after episode 4: Black Swan.  Bryce decides not to kill himself. Olivia at first resists getting closer to Lloyd and now seems unsure of where she is going with her life.  4----The show encourages each of us to project into the future. As someone once said, \\"if you always do what you have always done, then you will always get what you have always got.\\"  It impressed me so much that I now get up at 4:30 am- to make the best of the opportunities that life has to offer me!!!  We are all part of God's plan and someday when we meet our departed loved ones, they will ask us \\"what is new?\\" --I am going to make sure that I have lots to say!!!
0743277708|5.0|It's been at least 20 years since I first read this book - and coming back to it after all that time has been just as enjoyable.<br /><br />What I appreciate more this time around is the lessons the book teaches on effective leadership and ethics of equality and representative politics. Those are two topics I never would have noticed reading this in my pre-teen years. We'll worth rediscovering.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|There are a lot great reviews about the movie out there, so I can't add anything new or unsaid. I didn't watch the video when it was released because I thought it's just another average romantic comedy. Last week I eventually watched it for the first time and after that I watched it again. It was so much better than expected, the cast is stellar and the score is beautiful. Alone to watch Kate Winslet in one of her best performances is worthwhile to buy the movie. Jude Law stole my heart away and I even liked Cameron Diaz - the two of them had a great chemistry here. I also loved the subplot about Iris' friendship with her elderly neighbor Arthur. The film is never boring and never feels like a movie longer than 90 minutes. I highly recommend to watch this movie!

B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is just one of those movies you won't be able to stop thinking about long after you've left the theater. In fact, if you're like me, you'll probably need to see it multiple times just to get everything straight. There is so much packed into it's 2 and 1/2 hour running time, it's hard to keep up with all the dialogue that explains what is going on. Christopher Nolan hasn't made a bad or mediocre movie yet (Insomnia being the weakest, but still good) and thankfully his career is just getting started. Not only has he directed some great films like Memento, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight, but he is the chief writer as well. I read he invested nearly ten years in this ambitious project and it really shows. The writing and story are very clever, even becoming a little too smart for it's own good times. It seemed like some people in my theater wanted just your typical summer movie explosions, while keeping their brains in neutral. There's no getting around the fact that this film will force you to think.<br /><br />It's hard to say what the movie is about without giving too much away, but to put it simply, it's about a group of people who steal important information from other people while they are dreaming. In the case of an inception, they want to put an idea in someone's head which could have a huge impact on that individual and change the course of countless other lives in the process. All this is done by creating mazes and layers in the dream world to hopefully keep that person from ever knowing someone was in their mind. At one point towards the end of the film we're seeing a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream. Four dream layers going on at the same time, but it's so well designed I didn't have too many problems keeping up. Even so, there are a number of things I'm still confused about after my initial viewing.<br /><br />I can't really single out any one cast member since everyone is important to the story and they all do fantastic jobs. Like Nolan's Batman movies, the cast is filled with at least a half dozen well accomplished actors, in this case, Leornado DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cillain Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. Not a weak link in sight.<br /><br />The CGI blends in beautifully when used, though I have always liked the fact that Nolan uses practical effects whenever possible. There are some really neat visuals that are creative and unique, as well as, a few action sequences that will keep you awake if the dialogue gets a bit too heavy for your tastes, including a no gravity fight scene in a hotel hallway dreamscape. What makes it even better is that it's actually Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing all those stunts in a rotating room, as I learned from HBO's behind the scenes look.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's solid music score is along the same wavelenth as The Dark Knight in mood, but there's a little more emotional weight, especially towards the end of the film.<br /><br />Many critics are calling Inception a masterpiece. I think it's very close and easily the best film of the year so far, which you might think isn't saying much in such a lackluster movie season, but maybe this will help clarify things.

1400052173|4.0|Skloot does have a slight tendency to indulge in tangents that are not central to the story, but she is a wonderful storyteller. The level of detail in the science is just right, and the depth of research is impressive.
B002SJIO54|1.0|Man I have seen some bad movies but this one is really terrible. I watched the whole thing and I can't believe people are giving this 4 and 5 stars. I'd give it a negative if that were possible. Even Plan 9 From Outerspace was better than this.
B000025JMP|5.0|I think I have almost every album, now CDs, he made including TV offers, Estate offers, etc.  This is by far one of my favorites and the picture on the front is an added bonus! The King lives on!
0307454541|1.0|OK, I got suckered into the hype and got the book. The first 300 pages are boring confusing history channel material with little to no relevance to the action part of the book. The next 150 pages have the action with some pretty good page turning but then that part of the story ends with another 100-150 pages left. I had twists in my head of what was going to happen and my head stories were much better than the book. But no, the last part of the book switches stories abruptly again to boring corporate nonsense with cliche ending. What a waste of time and money.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|After hearing one or two songs on the radio, I decided to listen to the whole CD and I was amazed of how well produced their songs are. There wasn't one song I skipped! A must-have for everyone who likes Rock music.

B0029LX2LC|4.0|Without a doubt, those looking for the synthesized crispy beats that the roots have blessed us with in the past will know instantly that this album is on a whole different level. This album gets better each time you let it marinate. After listening for about 2 weeks, I have not been playing anything else. The Roots nailed their colabo's perfectly on this album...you can feel emotion and grit from everyone that touches the tracks on this album...They all have contrasting styles lyrically...thought, Phonte, Dice and the rest of the squad on this album give it that flavor..they stamp the track with some of the more hard hittin, deftly syncopated lyrics that I have heard in a while. The Mellow hooks and jazz smothered bass lines are so full of soul and real hip hop emotion, there's not much out there that will satisfy true followers of soulfulrap...you are gonna get lost in the album as it just takes you right into the studio. This album lays down all pretense and \\"same ol same ole\\" musicality. You can only appreciate and give thanks that these guys are still puttin music out. Im just feelin this album for real...
B0036EH3WK|1.0|1st - there are some spoilers in this review so if you don't want to see them, stop reading now.        2nd - this product is not released yet, so this is not a review of the quality of the dvd or blu-ray picture, 5.1 sound, cover art, special features or anything else about the DVD or Blu-ray release that you can buy here on Amazon.    If you are going to purchase and watch entire Complete Lost series (including season 6 and the final episode) you need to be aware that Lost is a religious story.    The series taps into the Biblical Old Testament and other religious stories, updated to the modern world for the sake of portraying good vs evil in the context of human frailties.    The plot, with it's many improbable and irrational circumstances, wanders for season after season and most events are irrelevant to the final ending.    By the time the series ends you'll find out that the Main Character, the Island itself, is nothing more than essentially a magical floating toilet bowl filled with golden yellow liquid that if it gets flushed into the Pacific Ocean the World will be destroyed.       One major plot line is dedicated to weeding out 107 of 108 possible new toiletmasters who will take over the responsibilities of the current toiletmaster to protect the toilet and the flush mechanism.    The other major plot line follows a small group of the 108 that go through many trials and tribulations which allows them to eventually be able to See The Light and Move On into the Hereafter.    If that is of interest to you, you should buy and watch the Complete Lost.    If not, don't waste your time and money.
B00005JKHP|4.0|It has been nine years since TMP was revised and re-released by director Robert Wise as The Director's Cut. I recently rented a free copy of this from a local library and was amazed with sincere admiration of how much this version fared better than the theatrical and extended TV editions. I managed to purchase a 'brand new' copy this past July 4th weekend on eBay for a really good bargain price than the other eBay buyers/sellers and Amazon Marketplace sellers have. Coming off the fun and excitement of \\"Star Trek (2009),\\" it's really nice to watch the original cast reunion that took place several years after the 'five year mission' from TOS and TAS.<br /><br />Off the heels of George Lucas revising Star Wars with extras and new CGI scenes, a CGI company helped revise TMP with new CGI scenes that are explained in 'Bonus Features' disc with Robert re-editing some scenes that made TMP look like a dragged out space flight beforehand which worked after what went on during TMP's production over time and budget constraints before it's 1979 release. Some of those new scenes were; Spock heading to the Vulcan temple that included several statues in place for the Kolinnair ritual, the train station at Starfleet Headquarters SF, the V'Ger spacecraft hovering above Earth, and plasma fireballs forming a bridge platform between the Enterprise and V'Ger. Other featurettes included cast & crew interviews, text commentary by Michael Okuda, group commentary by Robert Wise, production crew, and Stephen Collins, and Star Trek: Phase II documentary.<br /><br />For many Trek fans who badgered over the colorless/bland uniforms, here's two things I found; First the bland uniforms are modified versions of the originals worn by Capt. Pike and his crew from the original pilot/The Menagerie episode.

0061743526|5.0|Reading many of the reviews; I find myself like many of them in that for one reason or another I did not read To Kill a Mockingbird or see the   movie until now.  I was inspired to do so now in my more advanced mature years by the highlighting of it's 50th anniversary by PBS news,  NPR and by CBS Sunday Morning news.  I read the book first.  It is as good as any one can express with mere words and I would say that one  could owe it to himself to experience the feeling of experiencing life as if young again with all that wonderful mix of confused emotion that  makes life so vivid when experiencing it young.  I set about rereading it as soon as I finished it and I'll definitely be rereading it again.
B002B55XGI|5.0|This is an inspirational book... you can't read it without it making an impact on your life.    I'm trying to decide whether to make my teens read this for summer reading -- it's just one of THOSE books.  A MUST READ.  IDK if the book will ever be on Oprah's book list, but it sure should.      THe stories of the SEALs themselves are so inspiring. Reading this makes me want to find every SEAL and say \\"Thank you\\", and to go up to every SEAL family and give them a hug -- RESPECT... You will definitely come away from this book with a feeling of awe...    ...and you might be challenged along the way...
B003ICWTR4|5.0|To be honest, i was not really excited when it was announced that this wld be the show that would be released on DVD/Blu ray.   I had seen a few songs which was telecast in england , which someone was kind enough to send me a copy of, and what i was disappointed with was the distance from the stage to the audience. But after reading the initial reactions here, i picked up a blu-ray player just for this and got the disc.  It is nothing short of phenomenal.While i am  a fan of his earlier two official releases too(NY and Barcelona) this is the first video which does full justice to the briliant E-Street Band. Bruce, pls dont ever let Bob Clearmountain go. The difference in sound between this and Barcelona is like night and day.  The band is in fine form and Bruce as always is brilliant. At times, it does feel that he is feeling the strain of having performed the previous night in Glastonbury( in his voice) but the man is incredible. Where he gets his energy from is mystifying.  Oh and the distance barrier is broken very early in the show. I was also surprised how well outlaw Pete works in live setting.     I have been watching this everyday for the last 3 weeks and even my aunts who dont watch rock like  this concert.they have always like Bruce though :)  Been a huge (obsessed?)fan since i was 12, more than 25 yrs back and yet to see this man live(live in India) so till the time i get to watch him, i will have to be contecnt with these videos and as long as he keeps releasing such great work, i will be happy. Cant wait for the Darkness reissue.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan has done it again. He continues to prove that he's the master of creating beautiful, layered and imaginative films. With \\"Inception\\" we follow Mr.Cobb(DiCaprio)and his associate Arthur(Gordon-Levitt), a duo of specially trained thieves who enter peoples minds and steal their secrets and ideas. After the film's first mission the duo is offered a job by their original target,Mr.Santio. He wants them to implant an idea into his business competitor's mind(Fischer). He wants them to make Mr.Fischer think that it's in his best interest to break up his father's business empire after his father dies. A procedure known as \\"Inception\\". At first Cobb and Arthur turn down the project because it's too complex and dangerous but Santio has an offer that Cobb can't refuse. If he completes this mission, Santio can pull some strings so Cobb can see his children again. Cobb, heartbroken and desperate to his children(you have to see the film as to why) agrees to take Santio's offer. Cobb and Aurthur then set out to assemble a team of other specialist to complete their mission. A mission that will prove to be more dangerous than any of them ever imagined. Without a doubt \\"Inception\\" is one of the most stunning and imaginative films I've ever seen. Nolan really shows that he can turn on the special effects with the best of them. People run up walls, water floats,and cities turn upside down on to themselves. As enjoyable as \\"Inception\\" is, it's easy to get a little lost. Seeing as the method of inception is to create multiple \\"dream realms\\" or dreams within dreams, you can find yourself forgetting which one you're watching. Even the characters in the movie seem to confuse themselves. In one scene that I found amusing, Ellen Page's character Aliadne chimes in \\"Okay..So who's subconscious are we entering again?\\". \\"Inception\\" is a thinking man's action film and the best film I've seen all summer. I can't help thinking how cool some of the effects would of been in 3-D(they're making a Step Up 3-D! I say why not make a good film in 3-D?) but I digress. If you're looking for a movie that is fun and intelligently made then \\"Inception\\" is it. The best film of the summer by far.
0307266303|5.0|Born to run is a great and very inspirational book about running with passion.If you like running or you don't you still should read it because it will give you a totally new outlook of this sport.
1421527618|5.0|I read this 200-page book in less than a day. It's a very easy, quick read, but that's not to say it's not worthwhile. The time loop concept is handled very well, from the beginning of the book when the main character is still trying to figure out what's going on until the end of the book when he knows how to escape but isn't quite sure he wants to go through it. With each new revelation and each new trip through the same day, the story pulls you in just a little bit more.    The action and some of the more far-out elements (like the robotic suits they fight in and the goofy amphibious aliens) can seem a little hokey at times, but this is a fluff book, so don't go into it expecting Neuromancer and you'll be fine. It's the literary equivalent of a summer action movie, and it's a very good one at that.
0545123275|3.0|Many other reviewers have given wonderful synopses of this book already, so I'm going to skip that and just tell you what I thought of the book. I am a volunteer librarian at a small private school and I work with many middle school students, so I read a lot of YA fiction to book talk to the students. Every spring I have the students give book talks to their fellow classmates and one of the students talked this book. I have to admit that I had heard about this book but was hesitant to read it because it sounded like every other book out now about a girl falling in love with a mythical creature. However, the book talk was so entertaining, I decided I would give it a try. I loved the beginning and about the last 150 pages, but the middle of the book really dragged. The dialogue seemed very forced and the ideas seemed very repetitive. Grace and Sam were very likable characters and I found myself really rooting for them. But some of the decisions they made, especially about venturing out into the cold when they didn't need to over and over again and talking about how cold and dangerous it was, left me scratching my head. The way they bonded with each other over their experiences with their parents was very touching and the emotions came across as very real. The depiction of parents in this book was disconcerting, with not a redeeming quality to be found in the whole lot. Grace's parents were extremely self-absorbed and emotionally absent in her life, never noticing that Sam was living at their house even after he was introduced to them as her boyfriend. The supporting cast of characters was interesting, some more likable than others. I completely agree with the age recommendation that Amazon gives to this book. The characters are in their upper teens and they are dealing with very age appropriate issues. If you are a fan of this genre, you will definitely like this book. The author has certainly left me wanting to know what will happen next with Grace and Sam.
B00164EABE|4.0|I thought this movie should get an upgrade on special features. How about a commentary with the cast or Kasdan?<br />Deleted flashback scene that was to be at the end.<br />A nice new transfer would be wonderful too. Do it for the fans.
B002GTZSZU|4.0|Great liberties are taken with the biographical details of Mozart and Salieri's lives to create a morality play about jealousy in this enduring and stunning period film. AMADEUS won eight Oscars in 1985: Best Actor in a Leading Role (F. Murray Abraham), Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Director, Best Makeup, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Writing (adapted), as well as four Golden Globes, among numerous other awards and nominations. While the biographical details are altered, it seems that the sets, props, and costumes, all depict late 18th century Germany and Austria in stunning fidelity. F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Antonio Salieri is one of the best performances I've seen in modern movies and (I think) influenced the likes of Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman.<br /><br />Milos Forman restored 20 minutes to the theatrical cut in 2001 to make his 180 minute director's cut, which was restored and transfered to a special edition two-disc DVD set in 2002 and this 2009 BD. The special features also carry over. This BD is identical to the one in the DigiBook edition, sans the CD and Digital Copy, which were superfluous for me since I have several CDs of Mozart's music and wouldn't watch this film on a smaller screen.<br /><br />The video quality of the BD certainly improves on the artifact-laden DVD, richly displaying the colorful sets and costumes of AMADEUS as they were intended to appear. I hardly noticed any DNR; generally details are very clear. Audio quality is also boosted with an excellent Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround track that accurately represents the space and action of every scene and highlights the music with tremendous dramatic effect.<br /><br />With the excellent MAKING OF AMADEUS documentary included it is easy for me to replace the old DVD with this new BD, even if the DVD packaging is more refined (and informative, as it notes where footage has been restored). I can also highly recommend this modern classic to everyone, since we can all relate to Salieri's \\"mediocrity,\\" while enjoying a very fine HD transfer.\\"mediocrity,\\" while enjoying a very fine HD transfer.
B0036EBARO|2.0|I love all of Goldfrapp's albums (especially Felt Mountain) and was eagerly anticipating the next but after listening to this all the way through there wasn't one song I wanted to download (well, maybe \\"Voicething\\" and \\"Hunt\\"). 80s music sucked in the 80s and is even harder to listen to now. The producers getting otherwise brilliant singers to go for these cheesy synth arrangements should be tied up and forced to listen to their own music while donning polyester leisure suits watching Three's Company reruns.  Hopefully sanity will return on the next album.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Dreams have always been abstract, interesting and hard to explain. The intrigue of dreams vs reality. When does one cross the line? In Inception, Leonard di Caprio leads an all-star ensemble (including Ellen Page, Marion Collard, Ken Watanabe, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, Michael Caine etc.), to explore the realms of the dream state, delve into deep subconsciousness, reconcile with differences and issues and come to terms with reality. 148 minutes of suspense and CGI action that's really a thought-provoking and introspective look at life. Profound while entertaining, this is Chris Nolan's shot at critical and commercial success. Leonardo Di Caprio continues to shine in his tormented role (after Shutter Island) and you would think the Oscar will be his next year.  A+
B0029QRA1U|4.0|This turntable made a great replacement for the 20 year old one I had been using.  The turntable itself was very easy to set up; the included manual outlined the entire process.  I did have an issue with the attached RCA cable being very short, only about 3 feet in length.  I had to extend it using another RCA cable.  The power cord is much longer though, and should reach the nearest outlet easily.  The sound is very clear, even on my age-old system.  I was, however unaware that the turntable has a pre-amp installed in it, so I was unable to hook it up to the Phono Input in my home theater system; I had to use one of the Aux/CD/Video imports.    I used Audacity to digitally record my albums on a Dell Inspiron running Windows 7, and the device was recognized and configured instantly.  PLEASE NOTE that some of the settings may need to be altered, depending on what system you are running (the set-up guide explains this in detail).  Other than a couple nuisances, this device was an excellent buy.
B003ODL004|1.0|I hate to disappoint all the Zimmer worshippers out there, but Hans Zimmer is not a real composer. He has made a career from writing three-chord compositions, no better than any pop song on the market today. One might think of him as the Brittany Spears of orchestral music. I've never actually heard any composers, arrangers, or \\"trained\\" musicians sitting around discussing the greatness of a Hans Zimmer score, or the likes for that matter.     A reviewer mentioned something about analyzing each track of the CD. Exactly what type of analysis did you do? Structural analysis? An harmonic pitch-set analysis. Perhaps an analysis of the thematic development throughout? Or maybe you do not even understand what I'm referring to in the first place!    Coming from the film business myself, I can tell you first hand that people do not get jobs in the entertainment business these days based on their skills or talent. It depends almost entirely on who their friends and/or relatives are.     Believe it or not, musical composition is actually a highly developed skill.  Both music and the arts in general tend to get such a negative response from people in this country due to their ignorance and lack of a good education. Just because some kid can strum a  few barre chords on the guitar, or make some loops on his computer does not make him/her a mastermind on music. In the same respect, just because you can change a light bulb in your house, doesn't automatically make you an electrical engineer.     Although we live in America, the land of free speech and opinions (regardless of whether you know what you're talking about or not), it seems like most of the time, the people that are voicing their opinions are the ones with the least amount of knowledge, education or experience in the subject at hand. This applies not only to music and the arts, but in all areas and fields today. If you were feeling sick, would you ask the opinion of a carpenter or accountant as to what may be wrong with you? Probably not. Seems to me that people need to start learning a little more about what they're talking about first before giving their uneducated opinions.
B002QEISMA|5.0|I'm a huge Riverside fan, and, up to this album, I had been playing catch-up on their music.  So, when this album was announced, I pre-ordered it.  This album is tied for first with Second Life Syndrome for my favorite Riverside work.  Not only did the band turn the technicality of the music up a notch, but the beautiful resonation of the front man's voice with the music is perfect.  My personal favorites tracks are Hybrid Times and Ego Hedonist.  The level of philosophical thought put into Riverside's music is fantastic.  This is one reason that I love progressive rock so much---it is not shallow.  For example, in Ego Hedonist(a philosophical term, by the way), a specific worldview is presented, and the consequences thereof are shown.  Along the way, we see philosophical terminology and deep introspection.  This can be said about most of Riverside's music.  They are truly today's master musicians.
030726999X|4.0|I cannot imagine what it would be if you read this book without reading the other two, so I won't comment on that.<br />But as the conclusion of a trilogy, this novel completely satisfies --it concludes the story with no tricks, no complete turn around in the pattern of the plot, and leaves the reader satisfied that the right place to end the story was acheived. It does not take the reader to an absolute ending where no more story could exist. Sadly, unlike the author Larrson, the main characters live on. Let's say life later could be much more mundane and not for reading about. If, however, you are the adventurous reader looking for a shocking unexpected ending, then I think you will be disappointed. Thrilled or disappointed? It depends on who you are as a reader. JT
6305511055|4.0|Great movie to see if you like suspense/espionage.  Robert Redford is subtle, yet convincing as the grim-faced CIA member who narrowly escapes a planned hit in this early 70's film directed by the late, great Sydney Pollack.  This isn't the action flick for you if you are looking for fast-paced and IN YOUR FACE excitement.  This is a classic cat and mouse thriller, with an ending that definitely makes you scratch your head (but in a good way).  Excellent cinematography, great action scenes that are effective, but not overly bloody. Nostalgic shots of 70's NYC is a plus. Its absolutely worth spending a few hours of your life with Redford and the immensely creepy Max Von Sydow for this flick.
0736092269|5.0|I have the first edition of this book and I can say without a doubt that this is the best illustrated and informative, in my opinion, weightlifting book on the market. 3rd edition is much the same as first edition. Great!! All of the muscles groups of the body are shown. All of the exercises are shown in detail and what muscles are affected by the exercise and reviewed. This is not a book of essays that go on and on and leave it up to your imagination to do the exercise. This book shows cable exercises as well as free weight. I work out at home and 90% of my exercises are based on this book. This book can be used by beginners and intermediate lifters. The way it is laid out, it allows for variation of the excurses. Unfortunately I purchased several other weightlifting books that left me \\"blah\\". I wish I would have seen and bought this book first. Mr. Delavier did a fine job with this book.
B0027G783W|4.0|Could of done with more vocal entries as far as singing goes. The album if anything feels very cohesive. Gives off a polished futuristic vibe while not being too distant within the general electronic genre
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This movie is a creative milestone for animated movies, not only for the animation but for its warmth, charm and delightfully loopy dialogue.  There are also underlying positive themes of forgiveness, acceptance and helping each other out that are refreshing.     Shrek is the story of an ogre who starts out on a quest to save his home and finds love and friendship along the way. His journey is told from a \\"fractured fairy tale\\" point of view that keeps you laughing and engaged.  Every character from every fairy tale seems to be in the movie and that is part of what makes it so hilarious.      The interaction between the main characters is the main reason the movie is so funny: Shrek, the mean ogre who actually has a heart of gold and just wants to be accepted as he is; the obnoxious but lovable Donkey who turns out to be a loyal friend; and the idealistic but tough Princess Fiona who is looking for her true love.  They have issues and bicker and get on each other's nerves at first, but they discover they have more in common than they realized and that they really care about each other. All turns out well in the end.

B002VPE1OS|3.0|I always keep my iPhone screen protected. I am an avid user of the Zagg line of shield protectors. Zagg is probably known as one of the top screen protectors on the market. The Zagg surface is VERY RESISTANT to scratching. They demonstrate its resistance with a car key trying to scratch it. I performed my own informal key scratch test to compare the Zagg to the AmazonBasics protector. It reveals that the AmazonBasics model is not nearly as scratch resistant as the Zagg.    Installation is very tricky here, unlike the Zagg. This shield uses adhesive only. You must follow the instructions strictly, and you must try to keep you fingers off the adhesive side to prevent permanent marks under the shield. The Zagg invisible shield concept uses a liquid spray (probably just distilled water) to apply to your fingers and to BOTH sides of the shield when installing, which not only makes the installation easy because you can make minor movements to line it up, it also prevents fingerprints. The AmazonBasics shield does not use liquid solution for the install.    If you have tight latex gloves available, this will eliminate danger of fingerprints. VERY carefully pull tab 1 to peel back the screen protector, but pull only part way. Take the time to line it up perfectly before you continuing to peel it back while pushing out air bubble. It can be done nicely if you are careful.
0743277708|5.0|I recieved my pruchase right on time. It came earlier than expected and I like that. Its in very good condition too.   So far I'm on the ark where the rabbits plan to go to Efrafa. Its a real surprise. The movie which I watched before this is completely different. I'm not sure why the movie left out some things in the book, but I'm not gonna fault it on that. If a movie followed a book completely it would be many hours long. I'm really enjoying this book so far and can't wait to see what happens next. I might even watch the movie again and compare the two. First off (SPOILER!!!!) Alot of things in the book are more disturbing. An example is the destruction of the old warren. Holly and Blackberry's description on the events leading up to them finding Hazel and others just disturbed me. Not only were they attacked by humans, but thier own kind. Sounds similar to some human situations. Plus the whole tearing dead bodies apart detail...~shivers~. Efrafa is also described in more detail. In the movie the only thing I knew about Efrafra was that it almost represent a communist country or Dictatorship and Hazels warren represent Democracy. I'm not sure if this was done intentially or not. I would actually say in the book its even more obvious.   I must confess when I first read WSD I almost expected another book like Erin Hunters Warriors or that series about the wolves. I got something even better! WSD is definately a must read. I'm surprised not many schools have this and Plague Dogs in thier library. It feeds my inner fascination with nature. This, Plague Dogs, and its movie adaption are definately underrated. I don't know many peaple whos read it. If you love WSD you will also love Plague Dogs which is more disturbing, but just as fascinating.    NOTE: Im updating:) I just finished and I must say this is one of the best books I've ever read. When the story was over I felt like I just lost my best friend. You follow this group of characters, who are rabbits all the wayto the end and when its older its sad, heartwarming, and beutiful at the same time. I came closer to crying reading this than I did watching the movie. This book just pushed the Warriors series out as my favorite fictionous nature book. Not only is it one of the 100 greatest animated movies, but 100 greatest books. This story just earned a new fan! I can imagine how Plague Dogs is.

0590129279|2.0|NOTE: The \\"blue\\" cover is from the Howard \\"new\\" translation, the \\"white\\" is the Woods so beware. Katherine Woods' simple and beautiful translation is the only one that does justice to The Little Prince. Published by Harcourt in 1943 and 1971, her translation is the essential --- the translation loved and quoted by English-speaking people around the world, even by members of (need I say it) English- and French-speaking Canadian Parliament! But hers is OUT OF PRINT exepct in the UK (http://www.amazon.co.uk), so snatch up used copies while you may or do some Amazon.co.uk shopping!     WARNING: there is a \\"new translation\\" out by Richard Howard, and I accidentally got one. Ouch! His \\"New\\" translation purges meaning, and is not worth the money. It gives a falseness to one of the most sincere stories ever written.     Howard's lacks beauty, and is at times unintelligible: It simply does not make sense. Since Howard has no apparent understanding of the truths expressed in The Little Prince, it is not to be wondered at. One important example says it all: The fox's \\"secret\\" told to the little prince in parting ---     Wood's translation reads: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" She uses the beautiful rhetorical mode: \\"What is essential...\\" Compare, if you know French, Antoine de Saint Exupéry's original French text: \\"...on ne voit bien qu'avec le caeur. L'essentiel est invsible pour les yeux.\\" \\"L'essentiel\\" is in the same mode as is \\"Les Misérables\\" -- neither translate exactly into English. \\"Les Misérables\\" may be translated as \\"The Miserable Ones,\\" with less poetic effect. Likewise, \\"L'essentiel\\" might be rendered literally \\"The essential things\\" or put in the rhetorical form \\"What is essential...\\"     If Richard Howard wanted to make the statement \\"clearer\\" it would have to read: \\"That which is essential is invisible to the eye\\" --- wordy, and prosy, but it keeps the meaning. But Howard doesn't do that; his\\"new\\" translation of the same line read: \\"One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" Huh? \\"Anything essential is invisible to the eyes\\"? Far from expressing Antoine de Saint Exupéry's meaning, this generalization means, in effect, nothing. And it is obviously not true: Water is essential, and you can see it.     Katherine Woods' exquisite translation captures the essence of this line for the English reader. \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" Quintessential, no line in the book is more important. It epitomizes her entire translation. It is ironic that, in translating The Little Prince, Howard should lose \\"that which is essential,\\" and that he should be unable to \\"see with his heart.\\" You can tell the difference between the two by the covers. Woods' shows the little prince on a white background; Howard's is on midnight blue. But check the ISBNs!     Amazon.com's Editorial Review on Howard's translation says that \\"Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect.\\" This would have been better written thus:     \\"Katherine Woods uses poetic devices and a didactic accent to wonderful effect, capturing the essence and meaning of Antoine de Saint Exupéry's classic in a timeless translation. Unhappily and unfortunately, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified in a words-only translation, and he wanders off the mark, obscuring what were otherwise truths both simple and profound, giving the text a slightly wooden effect.\\"     To get the Katherine Woods' translation, make sure her name is listed as translator! are buying hers. As for Howard's translation, \\"NEW\\" is not better; it's just \\"new.\\" Woods' translation is the one I read, and helped me to understand why I grieved so when my great grandmother died. We'd spent so much time with her.And, as the fox says to the little prince in explaining why HIS rose is so important to him, \\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\" It also helps me keep in mind what I'm doing with my time, and why. If I watch T.V. the most, then T.V. becomes the most important. If I pass time with my family, they become the most important.     Another always-to-be-remembered example of a passage from Woods' translation dealing with the interaction of the little prince and the fox. When the little prince has to say goodbye to the fox, the fox says, \\"Ah, I shall cry.\\"     \\"It's your own fault,\\" said the little prince. \\"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...\\"   \\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.   \\"But now you are going to cry!\\" said the little prince.   \\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.   \\"Then it has done you no good at all!\\"   \\"It has done me good,\\" said the fox, \\"because of the color of the wheat fields.\\"     Before the little prince tamed the fox, the wheat field had \\"nothing to say to\\" the fox. \\"But,\\" he had said to the little prince, \\"you have hair that is the color of gold.

0307271862|3.0|Many mystery/crime-fans have expressed a lot of dissatisfaction, on mostly technical grounds, with this stand-alone Mankell outing which explores an horrendous crime in the Norland from a 150-year, global and cross-cultural perspective. Certainly the concept is expansive, positing murderous revenge (by yet another evil mogul) on account of transgressions against a distant ancestor, perpetrated by a Swedish rugged individualist working from horseback on the Transcontinental Railroad, a peaceful farmer in a socialist Minnesota co-op he was not.<br /><br />The author, long based in Mozambique, as unlikely as that seems, and not as a Lutheran missionary, was apparently inspired to concoct a travelogue also encompassing his discredited Marxist views. Hatred of Israel might be expected from a privileged Euro Left expat, who purports to honor the oppressed, but reverence, and indeed nostaglia, for Mao Zedong, and strained apologies for Robert Mugabe, are well over the top and amount to a silly screed. But then Mankell appears contrived in both his life and work.<br /><br />As reviewers have noted, the protagonist, a rather sad and hapless and, as the mystery/crime set say, incompetent, provincial judge (a woman), does and experiences many things quite unlikely in the real world. For some strange reason, the author tries to juice her up by depicting her as pining for an elusive sexual intimacy, yet as written one wonders why, as she's a bloodless character if there ever was one? Well, maybe that's why.<br /><br />This reviewer, new to Scandanavian crime novels, and looking for something after the Millenium Trilogy, enjoyed this novel more than The Man Who Smiled, with the unsufferably melancholy and solipsistic police detective Kurt Wallender, so traumatized by having had to shoot somebody.<br /><br />There's a vapidity to Mankell's references to so many sandwiches without one ever learning what they might contain. Coffee and sandwiches (never just one). It doesn't communicate. One wonders how many sandwiches are consumed in Mozambique not to mention Zimbabwe.wiches are consumed in Mozambique not to mention Zimbabwe.
6305511055|4.0|My husband could not believe that I had never watched Three Days of the Condor and so we watched it together tonight. I have to say that I was quite impressed by it - the nostalgia of the 70s (ok, so I was a kid then, but it was fun watching the rather archaic methods of research, i.e. no Google, the big old computers, and good old book-based fact-finding!); excellent casting, i.e. Robert Redford as a CIA reader/researcher, Faye Dunaway as Kathy the spunky captive turned love interest; Max Von Sydow as the cool and ruthless assassin Joubert; John Houseman as a high-ranking CIA officer with an agenda of his own.<br /><br />The movie succeeds as a thriller as it maintains a high and credible level of suspense throughout. The various plot threads weave together almost seamlessly, enhanced by the great acting by the various actors. Redford is quite believable as the preppy researcher turned man on the run though I found his talent for handling weapons and dodging experienced assassins a bit hard to swallow given his earlier claims of not having any field experience. Dunaway shares credible on-screen chemistry with Redford and I really liked that her character showed such spunk. Sydow is excellent as the assassin and he delivers a predictably compelling performance.<br /><br />It's amazing that almost four decades have passed and yet some of the themes touched on in this movie are still relevant today - conspiracies, deception, the role of oil (ye gads!). Final verdict - a taut and suspenseful conspiracy thriller well worth one's time.
B002ZG997C|4.0|I give this movie only 4 stars. Becuase, this movie is similar to other end of the world type movies. I think movie fans are tired of seeing these end of the world type movies. However, this movie does have a different plot. Denzel Washington plays a man trying to save the last bible on earth. All the bibles were destroyed after the war. He has the last one and he has to fight this guy over this last bible. Other than the plot, the fighting scenes were the best I have ever seen in a movie. The background effects reminded me of that movie, Mad Max. This movie has a lot of copy cat ideas from other movies. You will notice during the scene where their at the bridge in San Franciso. During that scene, it reminded me of that Will Smith movie. That he was in where he is the last man in the world.
0307454541|5.0|Extremely entertaining!  Nice character development and colorful details of life in Sweden,which I could really relate to, being Scandinavian myself.  Lisbeth isn't a very realistic character, more of a very strange super heroine.  But she's wonderful, so much fun to read about.  I am a therapist who has worked with many victims of sexual abuse.  In some ways the book rings true on this subject, in other ways not.  If it were more realistic about the effects of sexual abuse on its victims, it would be too depressing for a thriller.  It is more like the way I wish victims would deal instead of the way they usually suffer mental illness for years.  The author is so clever with his twists and turns of plot, I couldn't help being pulled into it.  It's like when I read Grisham, I am willing to tolerate some rather far-fetched events to enjoy being transported to some small town in the South where most of what occurs is so right on.  I very much enjoyed Lisbeth and the other characters in the book, and occasionally had to remind myself that they weren't real people.  I loved this book and am reading the sequel right now.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I described this series to a friend as \\"the sexiest show on television\\" and I stand by that.  These actors, writers, directors, and everyone else involved in this amazing production obviously care very much about keeping it real in this partially supernatural world, and they succeed.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the acting on this show, this is a very talented group of people who bring the books to life, but also add even more dimension to the characters and stories.<br /><br />The books are told from Sookie's point of view, and that handy little gift/curse she has, being able to hear other people's thoughts. The TV show is able to follow other characters stories as well, and it's wonderful the way they have kept the voice of the author, while expanding the stories to include more details about the other characters lives.  It all feels true to the spirit of the books.<br /><br />It's easy to see if you will like this, just watch a few of the clips included above.<br /><br />The stories have sex, action, adventure, self-reflection, desire, bigotry, prejudice, life and death situations, parental issues, fanatics, despair, relationships of all kinds, friendships, and all of this is set in the ever-present \\"world\\" of the deep south.  It adds a flavor that is has everything from cajun spice to homemade jam.  It keeps you wondering what will happen next, and caring about all of these people.<br /><br />The DVD commentaries are very good, and it's really fun to hear all of the actors speak in their real voices, and various real accents,  as well as appreciate just how good these actors are.  It's obvious their is a lot of appreciation among cast and crew, and they do a great job of giving insider information that is useful and interesting.<br /><br />My only negative is that they didn't include a gag reel!  WHY?<br /><br />Loved it.
B002ZG981E|3.0|Nowhere near as good as the Dark Knight or Memento. A movie for the angry internet nerds out there. Some strong visuals, a nice if overblown score, and solid work by all the actors involved. Having said that, the characters are flat, the pacing flaccid, and there is not a genuine emotional moment in the film. Nolan can do better. He has before. This isn't the second coming of cinema. The movie commits the biggest sin in film-making it is: BORING rather than thought-provoking.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is so fun for groups of 2-4. It takes strategy, but each game is fairly short and you can stop whenever you'd like. When playing with only 2 people I adapt the board by making the square shorter with pieces from a different color. You will understand if you play the game. I can't get enough of it and my dad, who doesn't like to play games, even enjoys it because it is so quick and easy.
0440236738|2.0|I had read two prior Coben novels: Deal Breaker (funny, entertaining) and Tell No One (good page turner). I had high expectations for this book but it came up very short. The characters weren't well developed, it's full of cheesy lines, and the story was very weak. It felt like those books that some successful authors crank out in a hurry just because they know their prior success guarantees them a certain number of copies sold.  It read like it was written in a couple of weeks with poor editing or written by someone else but with Coben's name.  Among the positives: At 340 pages in hardcover you can read this in one or two sittings.  Save your money.  Try Immoral by Brian Freeman or Tell No One from Coben instead of this.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the best album ever made. I know there are a lot of naysayers out there that hate Tool just becuase so many people like it. It's okay if you don't \\"get\\" Tool. You don't have to hate it just because you don't understand it. I personally have learned a lot from Tool, and from the philosophy they reference. I don't think Maynard really means to be taken so seriously as a lot of people try to. He's got a good sense of humor, and many of his songs that offend so many people are tongue-in-cheek and simply done because it's offensive. The whole concept that Tool is trying to get across is to think for yourself, and question authority. It's not to follow them like sheep, or worship them, or worship anything for that matter. So many people waste so much energy trying to do what they are told, or what they think they should do to gain status or posessions and it's sad. Everything we are tought by institutions is meant to keep us in line, and baaa-ing like sheeple throughout our seemingly meaningless lives. You don't have to like Tool, you don't have to do anything, but we all need to think for ourselves, and we need to question the very concept of what we think authority is. We could be a lot happier if lived life for the purpose of enjoying it, and helping others enjoy it, instead of for the purpose of stuffing our pockets with dirty paper for the benefit of those who print the paper. I want more for my kids than to have them lead a life in a cage. I'll be damned if they're going to grow up with the same, bassackwards outlook on life as everyone around them. This'll give them something to listen to as they break the mold, and live a truly free and happy life.
1843118750|5.0|A FULLY UP TO DATE AND ANNOTATED MARINE INSURANCE RESOURCE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're professionally involved in marine insurance whether insurer, broker or legal adviser, you no doubt have a copy already of Marine Insurance Legislation, probably the 3rd edition published 2005 - which means you now need to purchase the latest Fourth Edition to stay up to date.<br /><br />In fact, there have been three previous editions of this definitive work since 1997, all written by Robert Merkin, an acknowledged expert in insurance, arbitration and marine insurance.<br /><br />Part of the Lloyd's Shipping Law Library, this latest edition incorporates within its 450+ pages,  the many changes that have taken place in the marine insurance world since the previous edition was published, including a fully updated annotation of the Marine Insurance Act 1906.  (Drafted by Sir Mackenzie Chalmers, the Act was a codification of some 200 years of judicial decisions and remains in force, albeit with significant modifications and changes).<br /><br />Marine Insurance Legislation sets out the authorities on which this legislation was based and the way in which the legislation has been construed. There are cross references as well, to the most recent Institute Cargo Clauses, now in a new version -- the first revision for over 25 years -- which came into force on 1 January 2009.  Attention is also drawn to the fact that important new decisions have been taken in the English courts on just about every aspect of marine insurance law, including `the usual suspects - utmost good faith and warranties.'<br /><br />Other key developments cited include the role of brokers...the measurement of loss...and the rights and obligations of the assured and underwriters following a casualty.<br /><br />This edition also extends the scope of previous editions to cover other common law jurisdictions, referring to leading cases from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore.  A new and certainly convenient feature in this edition is the 86-page Equivalence Table included in the appendices which provides an at-a-glance comparison of UK legislation with its equivalents in these jurisdictions.<br /><br />This in short, is the definitive work of reference to marine insurance legislation post 2010 -including its formidable 39-page Table of Cases -- and therefore an indispensable addition to the well-stocked law library.ealand and Singapore.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Robin Hood -- In Like Flynn!<br /><br />When I heard about the Russell Crowe version of Robin Hood, I recalled that there was an early version with Errol Flynn, the swashbuckler of the 1930s and wanted to check it out.<br /><br />I have yet to see the Crowe version, but from the trailers I could see it was dark -- a freedom fighter who will stop at nothing for the freedom of his people -- we're talking Middle Ages Braveheart here.<br /><br />Hey, how about accomplishing the same thing, but not be so damn serious about it?  We're talking an all-star cast.  The casting was just perfect.  The Technicolor (this was new technology back in the day) is very good -- the reds are bright red, the greens are deep green, and so on.<br /><br />And all the stories that we relate to Robin Hood are all here:  the archery contest, the staff fight with Little John (played enthusiastically by Alan Hale, the father of the Gilligan's Island captain of the same name).  Interestingly, Alan Hale played Little John in the silent film version AND the later 1950s version.<br /><br />The DVD has all the stories and then some.  The effeminate Prince John, played in a smarmy style by Claude Rains.  Olivia deHalvilland plays the Maid Marion, who at first hates this interloper, but then recovers when she sees both Normans and Saxons being bled dry by Prince John.<br /><br />I won't go deep into plot here.  In short, a nobleman who was in good graces with King Richard (who went off on the Crusades and left Prince John in charge) is dismayed about what's happening to his countrymen.  There is bad blood between the Normans and Saxons and to have a united Britain, Robin of Locksley feels he must intervene.<br /><br />His lands are captured by the prince.  The Sheriff of Nottingham is supposed to be the main antagonist but he is really there for comic relief.  Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy, who is just as clever and just as devoted to his purpose as Robin, is excellent as the evil, angry nobleman.  He likes his power and is not about to shirk it!<br /><br />The swordplay is very good.  The scene where Guy and Robin are jumping up and down staircases, slashing and parrying, it's just a marvel to behold.  The actors were trained on sword fighting, so it was not the cut and wild swinging you will find in the silent film version.<br /><br />The DVD is a masterpiece and will take hours to complete!  Robin through the ages!  Classic cartoons.  The Robin Hood radio show from 1938.  A synopsis of the film process Technicolor as told by Angela Lansberry.

B002ZG981E|1.0|Inception is a typical Nolan movie in that it is well plotted but emotionally bland. The movie could have been a moving story of a father getting back to his kids after being wrongfully exiled. The movie however loses sight of this story and instead concentrates on dreams within dreams within dreams within dreams, just for the sake of being more elaborate. None of this nonsense is critical to Cobb's story.<br /><br /> The movie wastes a great cast by giving its actors one-dimensional roles. None of the characters apart from Cobb have any back story. Now imagine how terrible this is, considering it is already hard to connect with Cobb. In the end there is not even one character in the movie you can sympathize with. Marion Cotillard is always in the same annoying state throughout the movie. Whenever she appeared, I just shut my ears and started singing nursery rhymes at the top of my voice, which unfortunately annoyed many people in the cinema. The owner tried to kick me out, but at that point someone had a seizure in the crowd and had to be carried off. Quite horrifying. I am afraid it is the concept of dreams within dreams that did him in.<br /><br /> Another problem is the endless exposition. Ariade (Ellen Paige) here serves as the exposition magnet. Whenever you might start to think something for yourself, Ariadne does it out loud for you, and the reply comes quite quickly, relieving you of any need to unnecessarily waste your brain cells.  The dreams themselves obey all possible laws of physics and logic, which is quite absurd. I was hoping for something more surreal.<br /><br /> Finally, for a summer action film, the camera never stays steady during the action, which means you don't really know what hell is going on. This is classic Nolan though. He uses shaky cam here just as he used close-ups in The Dark Knight, rendering the action in both films incomprehensible. But there are many people who enjoy this kind of action, just like there are many people who blew vuvuzelas at the world cup and made a big racket. I don't really begrudge them of this enjoyment.<br /><br /> So in the end, if you care for any emotional involvement in your movies, just stay at home and beat yourselves on the head with a hammer. If you do it properly it can draw out tears.ld cup and made a big racket. I don't really begrudge them of this enjoyment.

0385504225|3.0|I'm not disappointed that The Lost Symbol doesn't live up to The Da Vinci Code or Angels or Demons - I didn't read those books.  This is my first Dan Brown novel and most likely will be my last.  I'm in about 120 pages and it feels like Brown is trying really, REALLY hard to convince me how smart he is - impress me with his genius (I believe another reviewer called it \\"smugness\\").  So far it hasn't worked.  It seems he knows a lot about nothing important especially as it relates to the story but he really wants me to believe that it is all true because he says so.  The writing seems sophmoric - there is a LOT of mediocre dialog and the characters are one dimensional even though a LOT of pages are dedicated to their histories. Langdon spends a lot of time fretting about Peter and then figuring out nothing.  It seems like the CIA agent was put in the story just to lead Langdon around because he's suddenly been struck stupid and couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.  The story goes NOWHERE FAST - 120 or so pages and they're not out of the Rotunda yet.  Quite honestly, I don't care why the guy cut Peter's hand off.  I don't believe that there is a portal and don't really care if there is (a good writer makes you care).  And I'm pretty much hoping that Peter's sister gets \\"taken out\\" pretty quick because she is the lamest of all.  I'm sure a good screenwriter & Ron Howard can spiff it up and turn it into a decent movie but as far as the book goes:  I really wanted to like this book but I doubt I'll bother with finishing it since other reviewers tell me it doesn't improve.

Nobody can touch him!---NOBODY!!  This was the follow-up to he and The Experience's groundbreaking debut  \\"Are You Experienced\\" (see my review for that) which knocked the established  rock gods and psychedelia bands of the UK as well as the US on their lethargic   earthbound butts!  AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE is every bit the masterpiece and continued  Jimi Hendrix and The Experience's paradigm-shifting creative run through  the second half of 1967 and into early 1968.   In fact, Jimi was so bad and ahead of his time that \\"Are You Experienced\\",   \\"AXIS: Bold As Love\\", \\"Electric Ladyland\\" and \\"Band Of Gypsys\\" stayed on the  charts at different positions from 1967 to 1973, which was three years after his death!  Today, his estate still clocks in at 4 to 6 million albums soldper year worldwide,   so it's safe to say what he and the musicians whom he chose to work with   put down on tape all those years ago is infinitely vital & inspirational!

B002ZG980U|3.0|I'll admit I'm very mixed when it comes to Christopher Nolan's films. I loved his first film 'Following' as well as 'Batman Begins' and consider them both favorites. I liked the ideas behind 'Dark Knight' and 'Prestige' but felt Nolan was sacrificing the fun in the ideas of his films for cleverness. For me, Inception is kind of in the middle; it's a science-fiction thriller with great direction and some fun ideas but feels a bit artificial in the story-telling department.<br /><br />The plot of Inception follows a bunch of 'mission impossible'-like thieves who have the technology to invade people's dreams and steal information. The team is led by the charismatic Cobb who has a tortured past and is hired/strung-along by shady businessman Saito to implant an idea into a rival's dreams. I loved how the people in Cobb's team are recruited, each having his or her ability in the 'dream' world (i.e. one's an architect who creates the dream world, one's a forger who can assume other identities). As the movie goes on we are introduced to more and more rules of the 'dream' world our thieves are infiltrating (how time works in different 'layers' or dream within dreams) at the same time getting more and more about Cobb's past. Unfortunately the film starts breaking it's own \\"rules\\" after a while and the pay-as-you-go dialogue gets so ridiculous that the experience falls apart and feels more like a blueprint than an actual movie.<br /><br />The cast in Inception (as with the rest of Nolan's films) is perfect. Leonardo Decaprio (in my opinion) gives his best performance to date as the lead-thief Cobb. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is reason enough to see any film and (in my opinion) steals every scene he's in. Ellen Paige is a good choice as the every-person for whom we see most things from and get alot about how the dream technology works. Ken Watanabe is great as Saito and Tom Hardy is given a fun character who can assume other people's identities in dreams.<br /><br />Another great thing about Inception is the visuals. While Christopher Nolan's screenplay is filled with too much exposition, the sheer imagination put into the set designs and action scenes is breathtaking. Buildings fold, characters walk on a never-ending staircase, and the gunfights (particularly the one in zero gravity) and chase scenes are slick as can be. You really have to see it to get how neat it is.<br /><br />I obviously wouldn't call 'Inception' best film I've ever seen. As usual I like Christopher Nolan's stories but I don't like the way he tells them. I did find 'Inception' worth watching, though if only for it's originality. With so many other movies adding up to absolute garbage it's nice that there's a director who's still thinking outside the box. I just wish he would leave some sense of wonder and imagination left to the audience.ng about Inception is the visuals.

And it's simply just because when I first picked it up, I had no idea that the disturbing and dark story would be one I would get so swept up in.<br /><br />While traveling for business, on a whim I picked Sharp Objects while waiting for my flight. I don't even know how to explain the premise without re-freaking myself out. But, allow me to valiantly try.<br /><br />Camille Preaker is a woman in her thirties, and a journalist at a small newspaper in Chicago who is sent to research and write about a horrible crime of two children murdered in her hometown.  It's a hometown that for Camille, has such terrible and dark memories, that she is repulsed and afraid of taking the assignment.  Why would she want to visit the old Victorian home that her compulsively neurotic mother lives in, and which her gorgeous teenage half-sister that she barely knows seems to run?  The home is the reason why Camille's turned into a vegetarian, which is fairly expected since it's situated on her family's pig farm, and the sounds of slaughter don't really sit well with Camille. Camille's already experienced enough with her sister's death when she was young, and has been compelled since then to destroy her body by razor-writing insults like whore and nasty over every inch of her body that she can cover up with clothing.  Not to mention, she just now come out of a six month stay in a psychiatric institution.  She's supposed to be in recovery but she sometimes will drag her palms over sharp edges to make them bleed.  Going back to Wind Gap, Missouri, the source of her traumas to investigate the murders of children just isn't a good idea.<br /><br />Dark.  Disturbed.  Twisted.  Manic.  These are the words always swirling through my head as I read.  I was held hostage by this book, and for two days during my business travel, I attended all meetings anxiously, waiting for when I could run back up to my hotel room after dinner and dive into the pages.  Gillian Flynn's writing left you troubled, with a sinking and uncomfortable feeling as you turned the pages and pulled more of Camille's life into your mind.  And what you think is the ending really isn't.  Suffice it to say, when the mystery of the murdered children is truly solved, I was stunned and couldn't sleep.  I thought about this story for days and still can't quite put it out of my head.sister's death when she was young, and has been compelled since then to destroy her body by razor-writing insults like whore and nasty over every inch of her body that she can cover up with clothing.

B002VWOMN6|3.0|I am a huge fan of Amadeus. It breathes intense emotion to the heart through supreme acting, an amazing drama, great costumes and music ... supreme, divine music.    Yet, this Director's Cut version disappointed me deeply.    Please note that my review contains spoilers.    While the picture and the sound quality are great, mind you, it is now obvious that the deleted (in the theatrical version) scenes were deleted for a reason. First, and foremost, is the scene with Constanze and Salieri. This scene *almost* ruins the film because it removes any sort of sympathy we may have for the *devil* Salieri. He acts so crude and cruel it's difficult to sympathize with his cause from there on.    The second scene that troubled me was the one were Salieri tells the Emperor that Mozart basically rapes his students. It amazes me that hearing such accusations, (albeit, outright lies) the Emperor doesn't take any steps to discipline Mozart, prosecute him, throw him out of his circle of noble composers (it could also be said that this scene also demotes the Emperor to an uncaring jerk). He simply doesn't asign him the post.    The third scene(s) concern Mozart trying to teach a guy's daugher, but ends up being frustrated by his dogs and leaves. This scene is continued to the horrifying second part, where a near-wasted Mozart asks him if he can now teach his daughter (as if there was any chance for that, looking and talking like THAT). These scenes make Mozart look so low, one might wonder why Salieri was so obsessed with him.    All these scenes, in my humble opinion, may clear out a few minor holes (\\"I hear you have debts.\\") but they also demote all the characters that are included in them, from Mozart and Salieri, to Constanze, the emperor and the diva.    Besides that, the rest of the film remains one of my favourite classics of all time, and the reason I started listening to classical music.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This video has three good workouts on it, but be warned about a few very annoying features. First, there is a ~5min intro to the workouts that you cannot forward through, which is partially made up of ads for other Jillian products. This might make sense the first time you do the workout, but when you just want to pop it in and crank out a 20 min session, it's really a bummer to have to wait through her discussion about how tough she is. Which brings me to my other complaint, which is JM herself. She is abrasive and complains a lot about how working out is not fun, etc etc. I don't find this at all motivating, and I really wish she would have just kept her mouth shut more during this workout. Otherwise, it has a good pace and is a good set of exercises.

B001CGJ3QS|4.0|If you're looking for \\"Big\\", \\"Monumental\\", \\"Storming The Heavens\\", \\"Grappling With Destiny\\" Beethoven, then this set isn't the place to start. It's small-scale, underwrought, just-the-music-without-the biographical-and philosophical-overtones Beethoven. For some it will seem refreshing, to others severely lacking in \\"weight\\" and \\"gravitas\\". The Beethoven of the Heiligenstadt Testament and of the cryptic shaking-his-fist-at-the-heavens-on-his-deathbed stories is missing in action. What is left is the classicist basis of the music rather than the extra-musical romanticist leanings that many feel to be the essence of this composer.<br /><br />These tendencies are reinforced by the recording which reduces the piano image to a pinprick-size smallness and is almost completely lacking in body, weight, and tonal richness. If you heard it blind, I doubt if you'd guess that it's a 1964 stereo recording; you'd be more likely to place it as a 1955 mono recording. In fact, at first I wondered if I'd bought Kempff's 1950's cycle by mistake. Whatever, Beethoven sounds considerably limited in size here. The grand gestures sound puny and the Heavens seem confined to the height of your ceiling. The ghost of the fortepiano lives on.<br /><br />I found this set much better in the lesser-known and (not uncoincidentally) \\"smaller\\" sonatas. Here Kempff's approach works better than weightier interpretations which make this unpretentious music heavy-handed with some movements sounding like a series of cryptic \\"harumphs\\". Kempff by contrast always brings out the singing line of the music. But most listeners will be more concerned with the \\"Name\\" sonatas and here I have to agree that there is often something missing, call it \\"gravitas\\" if you will. In the slow movement of the \\"Hammerklavier\\" you should get a sense that you're centering in on something  transcendent and I'm not sure Kempff provides this experience to the extent that some other interpreters do. I was underwhelmed here and in a number of other celebrated movements.<br /><br />To more mundane matters: it's cheap, the box is compact and serviceable, there is an interesting essay on Kempff's Beethoven but no analysis of the individual sonatas, and the sonatas are arranged in near-chronological order. My advice: don't buy as your ONLY Beethoven Sonatas set but if your budget can stretch to two sets it makes a refreshing counterweight to something like Barenboim or Gilels.celebrated movements.

B001TODCII|4.0|It is my proposition that Taken should be considered as two separate things. For the fan of the action movie genre Liam Nesson plays the ultimate in kick ass bad guy as a former CIA agent who is out to take souls and break lives after his daughter Kim is abducted by Albanian gangster terrorists on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda. Nesson takes no prisoners and is quite sympathetic in his role as a father battling an incompetent governmental system to save his daughter and there's plenty of bloodshed and bad guys that end up on the wrong end of his gun, along with several edgy car chase scenes. As an action fan, you won't be disappointed with this film.    As someone who has read a great deal of the problem of human trafficking, I was disappointed in the portrayal of human trafficking. Firstly although abductions do occur most domestic trafficking occurs through false job offers. Secondly, its' hard to believe that no one would take notice of an abduction that was that blatant. Furthermore, although the scenes featuring the girls as drug addicts are quite pointed, they felt to me more like an avenue to get to Nesson's character to kick some more ass rather then focus on the actual conditions that trafficked girls face. If I was doing this movie from a trafficking perspective, I would've spent more time focusing on what happens to Kim between abduction and rescue. Not only do you get more powerful visuals, but it would make Nesson's character even more sympathetic because the audience would get a broader view of Amanda's captivity. As a trafficking movie, the movie isn't the greatest at giving a realist view of the phenomenon.        However, if your action movie buff who's looking for a ninety minute killer and are not looking for an expose on human trafficking. You'll enjoy Taken because it doesn't feel like ninety minutes.
0312427999|5.0|IF American schools were still interested in teaching Civics, and IF people could set aside a little time to get a masterfully guided tour of the Machiavellian actualities behind the curtain of platitudes on \\"what went wrong\\" with the \\"free\\" market, and IF one wondered whether Dick Cheney is evil incarnate or just a highly focused master plunderer, then this book would be indispensable reading.  As Naomi Klein fastidiously reconstructs the convoluted hunting strategies of the predators who foisted George W. Bush on us, we come to realize that what we may have taken for breathtaking ineptitude in governance was in fact a scripted performance, or more accurately, a calculated bet that when the pieces of whatever public wealth they helped to shatter hit the ground, most of us would be too stunned to notice that they had been swept into private coffers.  Put the leading opponent of financial regulation at the head of the SEC, drag your feet on the redemption of New Orleans, stand by while the cultural patrimony of Iraq is looted from the Baghdad Museum.  Are these people astoundingly imprudent, or does this brand of cultivated chaos actually serve their purposes?  Naomi Klein proves the latter, and most of us are the poorer for the sociopathy she reveals.  The \\"f-word\\" is \\"fundamentalism,\\" and free-market fundamentalism is just as toxic and heartless as all the others.
0399156577|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I am a big dog lover and could picture Fee's dogs and loved all their personalities. Jazz who is Simon's dog, made the book for me. Big and goofy pup..causing so much puppy trouble for Simon. (SPOILER) I was worried one of the dogs would get hurt..but all was ok. Hate books that include animals being injured or killed.    Now..the romance. Opposites attract is what this is all about. The conversations and flirting (if you can call what Simon does as flirting, although he does improve) often made me laugh out loud. I really loved their relationship and how it grew.    The best compliment I can give a book is to say I am sorry when I am finished reading it.    I am sorry I am finished reading \\"The Search\\". Loved it!    Thank you again, Nora Roberts!
0765348276|5.0|My first read of a John Scalzi book and I will be reading more.  The book OLD MAN'S WAR is great.  The characters are rich and well thought out.  You can connect with them, feel with them.  And the story line of old retired folk getting a new life out in the stars as soldiers seems believable.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book.  It is beyond science fiction, it is a good story.

B001TODCII|4.0|5 stars for the fast-paced action minus 1 star for allowing the bad guys to get off so easily. Yes, you read that right. The bad guys got off too easily in this serious movie that tells of a serious real-world subject. Why spend less than 5 minutes of screen time playing with Marko the kidnapper?<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA officer (Bryan Mills) who single-handedly kicks up a minor storm in France while trying to find his kidnapped daughter. The girl, along with her loser female friend, got kidnapped by human traffickers while preparing to follow U2 band across their European tour. Upon touching down in France, the girls were befriended by a handsome local male. Unknown to them, this guy (Peter) was in league with a human trafficking ring. Suspense and fast-paced action follow that moment on as Bryan Mills tracks down the kidnappers' trails and leaving accidental corpses of bad guys here and there. The crooked French cops don't want to see Mills running loose in the city of Paris, but a man's got to do what he's got to do, especially since the local cops are so useless. Finally after some Steven Segal-type battles, Bryan Mills gets to rescue his daughter and they go back to America safe and sound.<br /><br />If you like action movies, this Liam Neeson movie can fill your collection.<br />In a sense, this movie reminds me of \\"Death Sentence\\", starring Kevin Bacon.<br />In \\"Death Sentence\\", the cops are also so useless that the victim's father has to find justice on his own.<br /><br />Recommended viewing:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0015XHP4A Rambo - The Complete Collector's Set (First Blood - Ultimate Edition / Rambo - First Blood Part II - Ultimate Edition / Rambo III - Ultimate Edition / John Rambo - Special Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000I2KRZI The Punisher (Extended Cut)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001QB9H24 Punisher: War Zone (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000541AN DEATH WISH]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000Y7U97I Death Sentence (Unrated Edition)]]
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Paul Greengrass has done it again. The film is fast paced with a story line that is original and captivating.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Underneath all the really impressive special effects and the sci-fi content, Inception offers a replay of the archetypal male fears of female sexuality. In this sense, the movie follows the conventions of Charlotte Bronte's [[ASIN:1441412646 Jane Eyre]]. A dark and brooding Mr. Rochester with a daunting past is here played by a blond and brooding Leonardo DiCaprio with an equally painful past. Both men are obsessed with control. What they are trying to control so desperately is the irrational sphere of emotions and dreams associated with women.<br /><br />Both Mr. Rochester and Leonardo DiCaprio in Inception are haunted by their wives who represent a raw, uncontrollable sexuality that threatens the obsession with control that drives these men. Both men manipulate their wives into what they see as 'insanity' and hide them either in the attic or in the basement. Both are helped in their quest to liberate themselves from the influence of their wives by a woman who embodies a completely different type of femininity: boyish, asexual, and fully dedicated to maintaining the world of logic and control at the expense of everything sexual, sensual, and irrational. The female lead in Inception is played by Ellen Page whose big head on a 10-year-old's body symbolizes her rejection of everything female.<br /><br />Even some small details that were present [[ASIN:1441412646 Jane Eyre]]  reappear in Inception. A huge knife wielded by Berta Rochester is picked up by the main character's wife. A jump out of a window plays a similarly crucial role in both works.  And, of course, the feeling of male terror that comes as a response to being confronted with the threat of an uncontrollable female sexuality informs both the novel and the movie in a very similar way.<br /><br />What Inception teaches us is that no matter how many special effects you pile up, some things remain the same throughout history.

If you happen to be interviewing in the technical fields you may run across interviewers that ask brain teasers. You'll find many of those problems  in this book. For technical interviewing this makes a good study guide.

B002ZG981E|2.0|I will not criticize the score.  I will not criticize the casting, acting, or efforts of the crew.  Inception's concept has merit and potential.  It has the makings of greatness, especially in its final scene.<br /><br />This is the first Chris Nolan film I can say that's disappointed me.  And this is coming from someone who's studied the nonlinear cut-strategy of Memento while in film school, down to the diagram level.  That was my idea, not thrust upon me by a professor.  Though my hesitations did start some with the trailers' not-so-subtle homages (read that as: total rip off) of certain scenes from Dark City, I really did give it the benefit of the doubt going in... hoping for the best.  Yes, the trailers thrilled me in spite of my feelings that the \\"highest form of flattery\\" was using a euphemism in this case.  I wouldn't fault anyone for doubting my sincerity after admitting that, but I was excited for this film even with the aspects of the trailers I found disturbing in their derivativeness.  Come on, this was clearly an attempt to recapture the themes and visual motifs of the late 90s that were a seeming artistic lineage dead-end as an unintended consequence of the cognitive interruption that was 9/11 and 8 years of Bush The Decider.  If it was me in Nolan's place, I would likely have borrowed from GATTACA and The Matrix, too, though hopefully with more finesse.<br /><br />So I was thrilled at the prospects of a return to that era of transcendence and artistic progress that was then; a return out of the dark ages of the last decade.  There has undoubtedly been some stagnation during this time and I've been feeling lately that we, in the Western World, are beginning to pick up where we left off: the re-immergence of electronic music as a major  movement, the recessing of jingoistic country music and pop ideals, from passiveness to active engagement, and a social & philosophical inquiry that delves deeper into the nature of consciousness and the human experience far beyond the transient, topical issues of the day, into something with immortality to the art.<br /><br />And in my opinion this film unfortunately fails at that.  Perhaps it's a problem of pacing throughout.  The forced contrivances of the first act trying too hard, too quickly.  Maybe the use of a rather unethical corporate espionage plotline against someone for which we've developed no animosity for.  Then there's the possibly unavoidable here but nonetheless detrimental Deus Ex Machina of seemingly last-minute expounding upon the rules with more jargon and redefining convolutions of them to further both the plot and suspense.  There is an undoubtedly manufactured, written, unnatural quality to the film's twists, reveals, and arc that remind me of the singular clumsiness in The Prestige when we found out the diary was a ploy.  But that was one instant of the seams showing, and briefly passed.  Here, though from an audio/visual standpoint there are no overt seams, they are painfully apparent in other ways: emotional and structural.  It lacks parsimony and elegance, but not due to length.<br /><br />Could it be helped with not only a slightly improved cut, but a different structure or tone from many, even small, changes throughout?  It has certainly happened before, as with Blade Runner.  Is the footage available for it to be improved?  Can the pacing, call-backs, reveals, and dissemination of Inception's rules be made as organic and natural as these convincing somnambulant universes the film's characters inhabit?  Or is the film a mirror of, and as deconstruction-inducing as, the moment those sleeping realize they are in a constructed maze, meant to misdirect and manipulate their intellect and emotions?  Is the nature of this concept too disruptive to the film form?  I don't know.  I have a nagging hunch the film may have been too reliant on its aforementioned influences and lacked sufficient inspiration of its own.  But I can't help believe there's a chanceit can be reshaped again, as good as any totally original concept.  Reading this review back to myself, enough of this film has obviously worked its way under my skin and into my psyche.  There is definitely something there, something at an intersection of zeitgeists that has slumbered during this last decade, waiting to get out.  There is just enough new and so much heart in the project, I dream of a better Inception.it can be reshaped again, as good as any totally original concept.

0316666343|5.0|I am an ardent skeptic and Atheist and despise religion, the whole idea of it. So when I heard that one of the most popular books of my time was based on a girl living in Heaven, I was quite eager to poke fun. My pet name for this book, before finishing it, was \\"I was raped and murdered, but watching you poop from heaven is pretty cool.\\" This pet title, of course, being derived from the insane and silly idea that everyone who has ever died lives in a paradise where they can infringe upon your right to privacy at will. Yeah, your dead ancestors watch you while you're grunting on the toilet.    Well, for about the first 50 pages, I held on to my hatred for the subject matter, but then I realized what the book is about. The book is not about rape and murder and Heaven, but rather about family and love and experiencing life. Rape and murder and Heaven are only the vehicles by which the author lets us experience life. By the 150th page or so, I became a pro at blocking out my snickers and scoffing at the author's belief system. Sure, the idea of an afterlife is idiotic, but the writing style and true reality depicted in the author's words are something to experience.    It is amazing and captivating to go through the mental workout and trying to comprehend the death of a child, and the ways to cope with it. The inner mental workings of a grieving, broken family are well described in this book and interesting to say the least. This book is about connection with others and with your inner self.     Some people are saying that the characters are underdeveloped, but I think they were either reading the wrong book, or must have an impossibly high standard for what \\"development\\" means. The characters are developed as well as they need to be. You are given just enough information about the inner workings of people to understand what kind of person they are. Then, if you understand the strangeness and complexity of modern life, you understand why these characters act this way ormake these choices. I think you have to have a wide and detailed understanding of life on Earth to truly appreciate this book as much as I did. Some of the sequences of description play on every part of your brain, invoking sights, smells, memories, nostalgia, and the deeper mental understandings which can only be described in analogies with the most perfect of nuances. This Alice Sebold lady might believe in ghosts and an afterlife, but she understands the experience of life on Earth as well as anybody I've ever known.    If you are too smart to be wow'ed by the spooky ghosties and the afterlife in the book, do not be turned away. If anything, Alice Seybold should have just written the book from the point of view of a nameless narrator, and left out the ghosts and afterlife. Her descriptions of life on Earth are rich enough without the high-fructose corn syrup crap of human religions.
B001HN694K|5.0|I was to just rate this movie. And short review. But you could jus read the review by Dan-Fabian. I agree with his review almost 100%. Some slight difference here and there. For example I basically watched the movie for Johny Depp being in it. Otherwise I would never have bother to watch it since it's not quite my type of genre. Actually it was my daughter who picked this DVD up, and I sneeked to watch, just curious on Depp's acting in this movie. Dan mentions Harry Potter and Narnia in his review. And I disagree there a little bit. I don't think Alice in Wonderland can be comapred to either Harry Potter. I watched the 1st Harry Potter and liked it, after that it almost became a serie, and I haven't watched the sequels. To me it just became \\"too many of the same\\". Never watched Narnia, but here also I felt, it's like so many others movie in the same genre. So I never bother to watch Narnia. But other then that, I totaly agree with Dan's review on Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />I realy did not expect to like this movie, as I said I was just curious for Depp's acting, but I did enjoy it. Not only for Depp's acting, but for the movie on it's own. Once I started watching I could not stop. Great movie, great acting, great set, great costumes, great story, great lines. Very entertaining.

This would improve the books' contribution on speaking and understanding the language.

0307454541|5.0|Dragon Tattoo is the most satisfying novel I have read since, well my own. It is layered, intriguing, compelling, and unpretentious. Larsson is concerned with telling a story and not \\"turning a phrase.\\" It is both about love and work (the personal) and personality, and a big idea-the exploitation, use and abuse of woman by \\"men who hate women.\\" (Larsson's title for the book.) I was captivated from page one. Firstly by the author's style - it is Hemingway-esque in that it is direct. Secondly by his ability to sketch out the characters slowly, adding depth as the story unfolds (like real life) and finally by the plot itself - who did what to whom and why and what happens next. (I'm well into the second book and all of the above continues.) Larsson had something to say, took his time saying it in simple language ... and then died. Interesting. It appears that the two main characters, a forty-something male journalist and a twenty-something female 'misanthropic nihilist' are Larsson's fantasy of the perfect person. They are personality opposites united behind a common cause - the protection and well being of women. The two heroes take different approaches and there is stereotypical role reversal. I disagree with my friend Jason Pettus' point of view that the sexual attraction between the characters was unnecessary (But he and I often disagree, yet i love his reviews.) It had to be, without it the story wouldn't ring true. The attraction was inevitable given the personalities of the two. Okay - there is this, Blomkvist, the journalist, seems to be the perfect man regarding temperament and Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, seems to have superpowers ... ahh - the perfect woman. Well, it is fiction. The author can get away with some provocative positions because of the oddity of his characters. In other words, he sweetens the bitter pill with sugar. Great writing! The fact that the story takes place in Sweden and there are names and references that are foreign did not bother me at all. Read this book! And the fact that Stieg Larsson dropped dead right after delivering the three manuscripts to the publisher ... well that, too, just had to be.not bother me at all. Read this book!

It is a romantic tale, a tale of village life and relationships, and a tale of how a group of people survived the Nazi occupation during World War II. The primary narrator, Juliet, is a novelist who has become charmed by the people and history of the Channel Islands. Her interest leads her to new discoveries and romance. Juliet finds herself gradually taking over the role, affection, and relationships of a deceased young woman, Elizabeth, who was shot in a Nazi work camp in France. It is the tale of writer leaving London and stepping into another charming world.  It is also the tale of a woman having to select which man, from two suitors, she would like to marry. This is a quick read. I read it in two settings, each for two hours. The plot and characters are never so complicated that you need to re-read passages. By mixing romance, history, and the charms of village life together in a unique setting, Shaffer and Barrows have created a very entertaining novel.
B003JR1JV0|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of Miley, but I do like her music. It has a fun beat. I bought the deluxe edition because I wanted the concert DVD. I really enjoyed her Hannah concert DVD, but this one was awful... despite the music being better. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. I had to turn it off when \\"Kicking and Screaming\\" was on. I love the song on the CD (not this one... the EP), but it sounded bad in concert. So bad that had I actually been there, I might have walked out. And from what I saw, she spends 1/2 of her time bent over with her hair dragging the floor. Might be because she's greeting fans by the stage, but it is not attractive to anyone viewing the DVD.<br /><br />5 stars for the CD<br />1 star for the DVD<br />3 stars to average it
B001GCUO16|4.0|Hugh Jackman is an outstanding actor and in this film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he demonstrates that he can command almost every scene in a full length film. The viewer never tires of watching him overcome one conflict after another. He commands empathy from the viewer and is in virtual control of the entire film from start to finish. Playing his brother, Liev Schreiber, also demonstrates his considerable skills playing a highly threatening, violent man-beast. We do learn the origin of Wolverine as young Jimmie Logan and his brother discover the gift of an animal nature within both of them and they exercise this violent side in the US Civil War, World War I and II, and the Vietnam conflict. The special effects were outstanding. The other members of the cast were totally superior, including wise cracking Ryan Reynolds and darkly beautiful Lynn Collins. The script was a bit too predictable. However, underneath all the millions of dollars of production and talent, there is a fascinating theme embodied in Wolverine, which is the struggle between the human and savage animal nature of mankind. Wolverine struggles with this duality but part of the fascination in watching Jackman is that at some level every viewer recognizes that we are all like Wolverine, constantly struggling to maintain our higher nature and control our most violent impulses. In this story, we see Jimmie Logan maintain control and seek serenity while his brother allows every violent animalistic impulse to rise to the surface and control his actions. But it is not just his brother who demonstrates a homicidal ruthless nature. Danny Huston plays a project director who will stop at nothing to control the gifts that have been given to the mutants. This is an entertaining film. It is not full of subtle nuance and is rather straight forward story-telling. Jackman and the rest of the cast make it special.

0525951113|4.0|I really enjoyed Daemon. It really surprises when the standard \\"protaginist-wins-out\\" formula is shredded to bits. You don't have to understand cyberspace to enjoy it but your appreciation for the details and plot are increased if you do. Action and social warning. Good combination.

B000F7CMRM|5.0|This is a wonderful film about one of the great areas of conflict, the oil states of the middle east.  You have an intense and violent mix of interests:  kings (and succession), oil companies, parts of the US government, mysterious fixers, and religious fanatics, combined with impoverished youth and lack of opportunity.  From the much-abused CIA operative (Clooney), the viewer perceives that there is something complex and violent afoot, which  spirals out of control once economic interests, ambition, and power interests emerge.<br /><br />The greatest fun of the film, in its non-linear presentation, is that it is left to the viewer to connect the dots.  COnnections are implied, but rarely spelled out and tied off only behind the scenes.  Everything is deliciously just below the surface.  For example, Clooney meets an old colleague in Beirut, a link to Hezbollah; they are buddy-buddy, then suddenly the guy becomes his torturer, sparing his life only when a Hezbollah chief unexpectedly appears.  This messes up Clooney's career machinations in DC.  Very little of what he was trying to do and why is clear, but there are allusions to it later.  It is wonderfully cryptic, but the viewer senses that it all fits in the end.  I don't want to say more because getting there is more than half the fun.<br /><br />This makes for a multi-layered experience that can be viewed many times, particularly if the viewer is interested in mid-East politics and history.  The acting in the film is also absolutely superlative.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is one you want to own.
1579126278|4.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of the definitive Agatha Christie works. Aside from \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\", it is probably her most famous work, most likely because, like with Orient Express, it had a twist ending that was at the time extremely unique. However, for the author, this ended being a twin-edged sword- the novel was originally so controversial that the backlash from the twist almost caused it's creator to be kicked out of the 'Detection Club': a group of famous mystery writers, because of the allegation she didn't play fair.     Since there isn't that much to see Dr. Sheppard, the narrator of the book, lives with his gossipy sister Caroline (the precursor to Ms. Marple, according to Christie) in the small English town of King's Abbott. However, the small town quickly becomes victim to a sinister crime- somebody has murdered wealthy socialite Roger Ackroyd. Hercule Poirot (in his 3rd appearance in a Christie work), has retired from private detecting, and is a resident in King's Abbott growing vegetable marrows. The Belgian sleuth is pulled into the case by a relative of the victim. With Dr. Sheppard by his side, Poirot works to unravel the tangled web of deceit that lurks within the victim's large household and associates, in order to uncover the truth.     Now, the first problem that plagues this book is that readers that want bloodshed and stimulation, the story is going to drag. A good chunk of the novel is devoted to wrapping up several loose ends and sideplots, which only tangentially pertain to who committed the murder. In addition, this is an incredibly tame murder mystery, with the only death that we read about (which, being the title of the book, is hardly a surprise) occurring early in the novel. Since the mystery is extremely insular (the motive is extremely private, and the other key players are already dead), the tension that is brought with the threat of more murders is never present.  Ergo, it is easy for some readers to be ratherenthralled by the beginning, but begin lose interest halfway through, if they aren't interested enough in the characters that are trapped in this drama.     The other main problem with the novel is that due to the controversy surrounding it, and the fact that its twist was the first of it's kind, makes it so that it's difficult to avoid being spoiled before you read it. Even if the identity of the murderer isn't revealed to you, the mere fact that the story is so controversial, and it's twist so bold for its time, could give the astute reader a big clue where the story is heading, far before our good author wants us to. And honestly, the twist is the only portion of the book that stands out. Christie handles most of the key plot points of \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" (A wealthy family plagued with secrets, blackmail, a secret love affair, etc.) more effectively, and more cleverly, in her later works.     Those flaws aside, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd does succeed on several levels. Christie manages to create several extremely interesting and sympathetic characters (the gossipy sister of the narrator, the shadowy butler, the stoic hunter), which manage to keep the reader (or at least me), extremely curious as to how these characters would develop as the story progresses. Also, despite the fact that there isn't that much murdering in the book, there isn't too much dead air per se either- the book takes place over a rather short time frame (like most Agatha Christie works), so there is always some kind of investigating to be done by our protagonists, and even the portions of the book that seem the least significant will probably prove vital by the end. Christie manages to keep the narrative flowing, throwing twist after twist at the reader, (although some of them are rather transparent). If the book demonstrates nothing else, it proves that you don't need a large body count to keep readers entertained.     Also, this is truly the book that shows Christie's prowess asa writer. The fact that the end manages to be powerfully hinted at, yet still able to be easily missed by the casual reader, is solely due to the very careful storytelling and wordplay of the author. That she manages to pull off Hercule Poirot's final deduction, without it coming across as a cheat in almost any respect, is pretty remarkable.     It is best to go into The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as a blank slate; totally ignoring the hype. Even if you can't do this however, you should still find an entertaining and vibrant mystery that has survived the test of time.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I enjoyed this film more than \\"New Moon,\\" but not quite as much as the original \\"Twilight.\\" I won't go into details about the plot, as I'm sure most moviegoers have already read the book. For the most part, the film sticks pretty close to the novel. There are some great fight scenes, lots of Bella/Edward/Jacob drama, etc. I freely admit that Stephenie Meyer is a terrible writer, but I love all things vampire and these stories totally draw me in.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of cleaning up some of Meyer's ridiculous dialogue, although some lines are still comically bad. Other things that bugged me were that the outlines of the Cullen's amber contact lenses were clearly visible on screen, Bella's longer hairdo was so obviously a wig, and the outdoor scenes that took place on a snowy mountaintop were so clearly superimposed that it was almost ridiculous. Also, although all the cougars out there will be thrilled with the many shirtless Jacob scenes in \\"Eclipse,\\" what really stuck out even more is Taylor Lautner's bad acting. (I mean, it is REALLY bad.) I was not too thrilled with the new Victoria (although she has better hair than the other one). I will say that Robert Pattinson's acting has gotten much better than it was in the last film, and my favorite scenes were by far the ones that included Bella's dad, Charlie, who always manages to steal the show with his one-liners.<br /><br />Despite all the silliness, if you appreciate these movies for what they are (vampire fluff), I'm sure you will enjoy \\"Eclipse,\\" as did I (although I laughed through the whole thing).
0307454541|4.0|I really enjoy mysteries, so this was right up my alley.  I actually became scared one night while reading it at home alone!  The beginning is SLOW, but around page 240 or so, I became completely engrossed.  Hang in there; it does get better.  Because the text was translated, there is peculiar diction at some points in the novel, but the author's intention and idea is always understood.  My only real criticism is the lack of clever metaphors and strong imagery.  However, I know this isn't meant to be one of \\"those\\" novels.  It is a thriller that delivers, but if you're looking for brilliant writing, this isn't for you.  It is, however, an exciting story.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|WOW!!! What a great album. Kid Cudi is an awesome artist all the songs have great beats, rhymes and are Fresh. This is a true artist who has his own style that works. Does not record the garbage Hip Hop that is played on the radio. His music is creative and new. I love every song, his rhymes are sick and the beats are out of this world. Would highly recommend this album.
0316017922|5.0|Seriously, after more than 900 reviews on this entertaining book, I doubt anyone takes time to read my opinion - however - I have one!<br /><br />The author obviously is fascinated with people who have attained \\"success\\" in their earthly life journey.  His measure of success may be different from yours, however, I enjoyed his viewpoints.  We think ambition and high intelligence is the key to \\"success\\" - the author has other ideas and they are worth the read, especially the last chapter which is wonderful and surprising, as are all the notes for our edification.<br /><br />The research for the book is amazing!  Great stories of people we know and also never heard of and how they attained \\"success\\" - (meaning achieved their dreams.) It's a book you want to re-read sometime just for enjoyment. I found it lively, provocative, insightful and fun. I would have used another title tho.
B002VX0A40|4.0|This is the first toy that my daughter grabbed and liked. I sort of had to get it at that point. It's really cute, we named him 'Ruffles' because he has ridges on his belly. The only cons about this toy is the ring at the back of his neck is starting to come un-stitched and secondly, this toy is not washable in the washing machine, it's damp cloth wash only. That doesn't exactly help when your daughter projectile vomits up 8oz of formula all over the toy. The felt just doesn't look the same. Overall I'm happy with it because my daughter loves it.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|First of all, I'm not a fan of \\"Batman Begins\\"- I thought it was a bit silly (ninjas?) and the Batman suit was clunky.  However, the buzz on \\"Dark Knight\\" was so positive that I was prepared to be blown away...didn't happen.    Dark Knight has excellent acting and production values.  Heath Ledger's performance is extraordinary and he deserved his posthumous Oscar.  However, the story is just...ok.  It's frankly a bit pretentious (tries to be MEANINGFUL and symbolic of the times), and it falls flat.  The dialogue is also silly at times, especially Gordon's closing lines as he sums up why Batman is \\"heroically\\" sacraficing his reputation so that the dream of Harvey Dent's perfection lives on.  Give me a break.    Superman (1978) and SpiderMan 2(2004) are still the best superhero movies of all time.  This is just good, not great.    Oh yeah, the Batman suit is much better this time.  But Bale's batman voice is still terrible.

1593083580|4.0|Ms. Austen writes a fantastic story for the most part. The gossip was a little much at times. And the stereotypical situations and feelings were accurate even if a little annoying. The story flowed fairly well. I was impressed with keeping all the different characters and traits separate. Just a lot going on and different story lines. I was impressed with how much was in the book and everything was wrapped up neatly. Some things hadn't happened yet but you knew what was going to happen.<br /><br />I truly felt for Anne. She was trying to follow the influence of a friend since her mother was dead. I understand but she finally had to figure out for herself what was right and stick to it. Things seemed to go better now that she was older. Family and friends didn't fight things for her so much. Of her family members I loved her older sister Mary the best. She had her moments where she would get \\"sick\\" or get frustrated with her husband for making plans when plans were already made. But she had to learn to speak up as well. The women just kind of sat back and did nothing sometimes.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the book. The drama was a little bit overwhelming but I had to find out how it ended. I wanted to know if Anne and Fredrick would end up together. I could see how things would all play out or at least how I hoped it would end up. Ms. Austen is an amazing author and I cannot wait to read more of her work.

0321701763|1.0|Book does not provide instruction nor tutorials relative to ALL the new features advertised by Adobe for Photoshop CS5. (1)I see it as a slightly edited version of the editions for earier Photoshop CS versions. (2)It is full or errors such as Lesson 13 which seems to have missing pages or missing instructions. I wrote to Adobe Press twice about these errors. No response! (It gives no insight on use benefits with a 64bit Windows7 OS. (3)It gives improper instructions to reset Preferences with Window 7. (4) Again more than half of the lessons are from CS4 CIB as well as earlier versions. (5)Poorly proof-read and edited. Had I not written in the book, I would have returned it for a refund. (6) Also for anyone not experienced in photshop, which is not intuitive, the book is useless.  All in all if possible I would give Adobe Classroom in a Book for Photoshop CS5  Zero Stars! I do not recommend this Book.

I couldn't put it down and am already sorry it's coming to an end.<br />An excellent read that I would recommend without hesitation.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Well, I didn't think that the show could ever improve upon their last season, which went out with a bang, and left me--along with the rest of the fans--hanging.  But, in true Kripke fashion, the new season did not disappoint.  If anything, it heightened the tension and increased the stakes introduced from the last, exploring an unquestionably controversial topic and providing innovative twists and turns on age-old mythologies.<br /><br />And of course, I can't say enough about the acting in this show.  It pulls you everywhere from despair to laugh-aloud humor, to hope, and back again.  I can't get enough of these brothers and a certain angel over their shoulders.<br /><br />If you're already a fan of the series, this new season will enthrall you as much as the last season did.  And, IMO, it is definitely worth it to own the box sets.  I gain a lot of mileage out of them, watching my favorite episodes over again, and of course the extra features, which are always interesting.<br /><br />I can only hope that the sixth season will be as impressive as its predecessor.
B003KRJNBW|1.0|Seriously!??!! This movie sucked!! The only reason why anyone liked this film was because there was a bible in it. I feel a great deal of shame for Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman.
B0037QGS0A|2.0|Well lots of these types of movies don't get stellar reviews and even though this one isn't terrible it just doesnt go anywhere, fast, that is. Its very prolonged and at times agonizing to watch because all the different stories and things going on with the star of the movie \\"Chloe\\" who is an escort service girl. The sexuality of the film is quite erotic and everyone seems to be getting turned on by this girl, so it really is kind of silly. Problems esculate as the film goes on, but nothing really concrete, Julianne Moore even gets caught up in the who sexpidition but this really doesnt add to the story at all, even though she expects that he's cheating. So the tables are turned thoughout the film, and stories get very convuluted. So its really not what i expected, its just very boring and corny, with a lot of taboos. If you want a great film about cheating, and the consequences it holds watch Unfaithful, its one of the best films of this kind that i have ever seen, there is just no real substance or emotion here. Just another dull accusation film.
B0012GVKW8|1.0|I should have known when I got this blu-ray disc in a 2 pack for $20... don't waste your money, get the more recent \\"ultimate hunter edition\\".    There are ZERO extra features on this thing except for the movie trailer.  The video quality is terrible... It's upscaled DVD at best, not even close to blu-ray quality.  The back of the box says the video is MPEG2 @ 19 MBPS... the new one is AVC @ 33 MBPS, and there is a HUGE difference in the video quality.    You're better off getting the 2 disc DVD edition over this blu-ray edition... same video quality and at least you'll get all the bonus material.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Of all of the Twilight Saga Soundtrack's this is by far the best yet!  Almost every track stands out on it's own.

Personal favorites were \\"Heavy in Your Arms\\", \\"Jonathan Low\\" and \\"With You in My Head\\".

B002ZG980U|5.0|I have to be honest, five or six months ago was the first time I heard about  Inception, and I didn't think much about it. To me, it was just some movie   distracting Christopher Nolan from working on the next Batman film,  which I'm eagerly awaiting. But the more I heard about the plot of  the film, and the more commercials I was bombarded with during the MLB All-Star game, my interest grew to the point where I had to see it opening day.  It was worth it. This is the most original film of the decade (and  maybe then some). The visual effects are astonishing and the story is complex,  keeping your mind busy for the full 148 minutes. This is what a good action   film should be. Thank you Christopher Nolan for continuing to put thought  (in this case, ten years worth) into your scripts.     Treat yourself, and, your mind. See this film. Better yet, see it several times.
1878424319|3.0|As a student and practitioner of spirituality the Law of Attraction (LOA), I found Ruiz's The Four Agreements very much in line with other spiritual discovery teachings. While the book was very enlightening I found that the culturally charged language got in the way of what could have been a cleaner and clearer message. Several places Ruiz refers the negative thinking or the misuse of words as \\"black magic\\" and those who misuse words as \\"black magicians\\". Also, much of the tone is as if he is scolding the reader. This is in contrast to books like \\"the Secret\\" (R. Byrne) where she uses terms like \\"bad thoughts\\" and \\"good thoughts\\" which are not culturally charged and the message is delivered with love and caring. I can't recommend this book to any who understands the American language as their first book to LOA and I even hesitate to read it again. Loads of good stuff in it - the prayers at the end- but the delivery contaminates the message. It's like having your favorite meal serve on a garbage can lid.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Last night we traveled to Aventura to see Inception at the IMAX theatre. Aventura provides the benefit of a nice dinner before the show because of the many wonderful restaurants available to the public.    We selected Rosalia, an Italian restaurant accessible both from inside the mall as well as from the courtyard where AMC theatres are located.    From the start, this movie captured our imagination and as we did our morning walk today, we could talk of nothing else. The premise is people that learn to tap into their minds, utilizing the subconscious to recreate reality at different levels.     What is new about this? We all dream, we are all capable of escaping reality by focusing on memories of the past, or returning to places we liked, where we felt safe. But in this movie, the experience is shared with others and learning about another person's mind and how they think, sometimes planting an idea that turns the other person's life into the reality of our choosing is new.    We are able to experience these shared dreams through the power of film, but we come to understand that these people simply go into a trance of sorts, into a powerful recreation of a certain reality that they are able to share as a team.     An architect is required, a person that builds a certain reality, shares it with the team for understanding and they go off, together, to experience highly emotional and philosophical escapes.    Arthur played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dom Cobb masterfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio join to steal ideas for clients from the minds of their competitors.     But as with all things, times are hard and Mr. Cobb becomes estranged from his family. Saito, played by Ken Watanabe, hires Cobb to get to Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy. The purpose is to plant an idea in the mind of this powerful businessman.    Without giving the plot away, it gets so complicated that Cobb requires fresh talent and they hire an architecture student played by Ellen Page, a chemist,played by Dileep Rao and a forger played by Tom Hardy who designs the most incredible of experiences.    To be perfectly honest, we could not hear everything that was said because the sound track overpowers voices but plan to acquire the DVD and with the tool of subtitles see this movie again to fully grasp the dialogue.    Our minds are our greatest asset and few if any have tapped into its full potential. So, as we watched the movie we concluded that there are endless possibilities of what we can do if we focus on the development of our minds.    In the end, we rated this movie with a simple word: Awesome!
B002ZG997M|3.0|There is nothing more to the movie than was promised. It is post-apocalypse and Eli (Denzel Washington) must deliver the last KJB to the west.  To do this he must go through Mad Max territory. He makes a stopover in a town ran by Carnegie. Carnegie is Gary Oldman in his Jean Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg character from \\"The Fifth Element\\". I guess some people are destined always to play the ruthless bad guy.<br /><br />So will Eli make it out west and foil Zorg (oops) Carnegie or will the bad guy finally win for once.  After all being ruthless has its advantages. Of course, there has to be a ditzy girl to slow or distract Eli from his mission. In the case, it is Solara (Mila Kunis) who is not aware of the wicked ways of the west.
B000WZAE1I|1.0|This book had so much potential it's hard to believe the writers of this movie did more than skim the novel when they drew up the script.  If you have read the book and are thinking maybe you'd like to follow it up with the screen adaptation, I suggest you reconsider.
0312360258|2.0|Could be a good story but the writing is that of a middle school kid. rushed and embarrassingly laughable. There was no detail of any kind. The main character thinks and talks as if she's 12 or 13... Not like a 16 year old. In the book she says her favorite curse word is \\"hell\\". I laughed pretty hard at that because... One, it was irrelevant to the story and two it was utterly ridiculous! If you're 16, I'm sure hell wouldn't be your favorite curse word.Other reviewers have mentioned that she uses the word boobie and poopie. I nearly threw down the book and burned it when I read that. A 16 year old would not say boobies and or poopie unless they're talking to a baby... I know it's a YA, but the other students were just throwing the f word around like no tomorrow so why not the main character? I'm not offended by the words, I would find it making the character more believable, but totally ruined it when poopie and his friend boobie showed up.    All in all I just couldn't get into the book. No depth, no character building, no real substance. I can't believe this actually got published and that people find the books enjoyable. The writing is so jumbled and rushed that I find myself rereading sentences to make sure I didn't miss anything. I'm still only on page 106 and making myself try to read it, because the series was so highly recommended by my sister. The thing I dread most is that I have to finish this book THEN read the other 4 she supplied me so that I don't piss her off. yaaaay...
0810970686|5.0|I just want to say that my 9 yr old despises reading, we couldn't get him to enjoy it for anything. We tried many different books and a variety of topics, no luck. One day at his school library, he brought home \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" and before we knew it he was reading the book every chance he had and we didn't have to nag him to do so, EUREKA!! His teachers advised that the book was too advanced for his level, but he would sit down and read to me every night without me suggesting it. He sounded out words and questioned the meaning of certain vocabulary he didn't recognize. He explained that he enjoyed the book because he could relate to Greg, the main character in the book and he said is was funny, always making him laugh because of Greg's sense of humor (much like my son's, might I add). Soon after I found all the books, right here on Amazon for very inexpensive and I knew it was money well spent. My son loves the books and best of all, ENJOYS reading now, it has helped his spelling and reading scores, he has finished every book 3x over and loves the \\"Do it Yourself\\" book that is a fun-ish journal type book they can fill in on their own. I would recommend this for ages 9 and up, my 12 yr old nephew also has the books and loves them as well! Just hope that the author continues to write the books as fast as kiddos can read them!

Although this causes some jumps in the story, it offers an interesting portrait of the lives of these two people, and how they change over the years.  Nicholls is able to develop surprising depth in his characters, even though we only see a snippet of their lives at a time.  His writing is witty, funny, real, and at times, heartbreaking.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  It took a few chapters to feel connected with the characters, but after I was, I was totally hooked and found the book hard to put down.  I was right there with them for every heart wrenching life turn, rooting for them to find their right path in life.  The buzz for this book was right on--this is one to read now!
B000L53D4O|5.0|We ended up getting this toy at a second hand store when our 4 year old was only 9-10 months old.  and now our 15 month old loves it.  It is so easy to push and is just the right height for him.  It also folds down so your child can play with it even if he isn't walking yet or if you want to travel with it.  This has been a favorite in our house!  The only bad thing is that now the red handle folds down easier, but I think that's only because we've had it a while and my 4 year old likes to run with it.   worth it!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica finally returns back to some head banging music.  After being fed riffs from a sippy cup for so long, this album is like drinking a large espresso.  It's a welcome change.  Sure, it's not a perfect album, but we've been through so much as fans that it's just a relief to hear something resembling thrash out of Metallica again.  The Black album was genius and it stands on its own, but afterward the band got stuck in this country/bluesy rut.  James still sings a lot like he did on the Black album, which isn't all that bad.  Lars really breaks out of his shell and it doesn't sound like he's beating on a couple of buckets (I hate that sound) on this album.  If you listen close you can hear some diversity in his playing.  It was refreshing to hear Kirk do some solo work, but it's nothing like the old albums.  This isn't a perfect album, but it seems like a reawakening of sorts, returning to roots.  Is this Metallica's transformation album back to thrash/technical metal?  I hope so.  A solid effort and some kickin' music.  Given all the angst we've had over the years, I feel some relief.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Leonardo di Caprio (in a role and a film that bears more than a superficial resemblance to his most recent other role in Martin Scorcese's [[ASIN:B001GCUO5M Shutter Island]]) plays a dream thief, hired by powerful bigwigs as a kind of corporate spy to ferret out trade secrets, not by sneaking into offices and tapping phones; rather, his job is to infiltrate the mind while the victim sleeps, and find a way to tap into his or her subconscious.  He used to be the best, but now it turns out his deep-seated guilt at a past misdeed is coming back to haunt him in his dreams even as the real life consequences of his past are catching up with him while awake.  It's a fascinating thrill ride - that is entertaining as it entertains some of the basic questions of philosophy, such as what is real, how we can know, and whether our thinking belongs to us.  It's also the latest in a long line of films that explores the implications of the fact that half our lives are spent sleeping and at least some of that time is spent wandering worlds we may not remember when we wake up.<br /><br />Cinema has always been fascinated by dreams, since the immersion within a film resembles nothing so much as a dream.  The lights go out and you lean back, forgetting about your worries of the day, and find yourself thrust into the midst of a situation, that somehow, almost directly, makes sense.  You find yourself meeting strangers, and yet they are almost familiar, and in moments you feel as though you know them even while you know that you have not met.  Even more, like dreams the cinema somehow caters to desires and fascinations we may not have known we possessed, obsessions we are possessed by unawares.<br /><br />Early filmmakers attempted to exploit this similarity between dreams and cinema, and the ease with which the audience accepts what should seem strange, once the basic logic of a situation is clear.  Experimental cinema, notably works by surrealist master [[ASIN:B0006IUE9I Luis Bunuel]] and poetic filmmaker [[ASIN:B00006JMRA Maya Deren]], explored dreams directly in their films, and even while they broke the usual rules of conventional narrative cinema, and associated images, not in accordance with the principle of continuity but in accordance with a dream (and nightmare) logic, their work somehow made emotional sense, hung together in ways that defied easy explanations.  The familiar difficulties in discerning the difference between dreams and waking life, at least when one is in the midst of a dream, caused Descartes to raise questions how we can be certain of anything; long after Descartes, the association of dreaming with doubt has been explored in a number of films, especially science fiction classics such as [[ASIN:B00070FX5U Total Recall]].  The tendency within such films to use dreams as a too easy resolution of plot problems by suggesting that everything we've seen may really have been a dream (usually signaled by a character waking up), has made this a cliche, that, thankfully, Nolan avoids, in part by exploring the cliche directly, and in some intriguing detail.  As his film makes clear in the opening scenes, if dreams have the impact of leading us to question our waking life, then waking up at the apparent end of a dream proves nothing.<br /><br />There's lots to think about here, and I imagine the Freudian philosopher Slavoj Zizek will have a field day with this one, since of course a film about dreams can't help but engage with Freud, and there are lots of Freudian elements in the film (the daddy issues, the obsession with and repression of female sexuality, the way that the repressed feminine character wields a phallic knife...).  What intrigued me most about this film, though, and makes me want to watch it again (and this is one of those rare blockbuster films that probably requires a second or third watching, but at the same time manages to make sense for the most part and be exciting to watch the first time around), is its exploration of the idea of \\"inception\\" - of what it means to put thoughts into another's head.  I'm especially intrigued by one of the examples in the film of a successful act of inception, and wonder whether it is really best described as a case of putting an idea into someone's head.  When the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates led people to question their ideas, when he inspired them to doubt, it's an interesting question whether he'd managed what in this film is called \\"inception.\\"  Socrates himself claimed never to teach anyone anything, that he never put any new thoughts in their head, but claimed only to be a midwife for the ideas they already possessed.  It's worth asking whether Cobb is like Socrates in this respect.  In any case, even if this film didn't put any new ideas in my head, and I'm not sure it has anything really new to say, it still raised some intriguing questions, and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  Definitely fun stuff.\\"inception\\" - of what it means to put thoughts into another's head.

B003A2JBIM|5.0|I just picked this up at Toys R Us for $40, I have no idea why it's so much more here. But I'm glad that Lego made this set, adds yet another Lego Luke Skywalker minifiture to collect (Hoth). Great figures, snowspeeder and pilot are cool, and the monster is a nice addition to a collection.
0061922315|3.0|This story starts with two families, one in India and one in California.  The California couple struggles with infertility, and the resulting strain this places on the marriage between Somer and Krishnan.  The Indian mother has given birth to one daughter already - a daughter who was disposed of because of her gender.  When Kavita gives birth to a second daughter she and her sister sneak the baby to an orphanage to give her a chance at life.  When the California family travels to India to adopt baby Asha, she unknowingly becomes the thread that ties the two couples together.  The novel changes perspective every few pages, moving between Somer and Krishnan and Kavita and her husband, Jasu, as the years pass.  Eventually Asha's point of view also enters the story as she goes through normal teenage angst coupled with feelings of abandonment by her birth parents and a lack of acceptance from her adoptive parents.    Quote: \\"Somewhere in the extra giving, in the space created by generosity without score keeping, was the difference between marriages that thrived and those that didn't.\\"    Although this book had some very engaging parts, I did not enjoy it as much as other reviewers.  The plot was good, but I thought the characters and the relationships between them were weak.  From the first few dozen pages, episodes involving Krishnan showed him to be insensitive and self involved.  This caused me to dislike Krishnan until a few more dozen pages revealed all the California players to be insensitive and self involved.  Somer, why marry a guy from India and adopt and Indian daughter if you have zero interest in learning about the country, and actively resent their efforts to connect with it?  Krishnan, why whine that your wife doesn't cook Indian food as well as a twelve year old could - talk to her about it or cook it your own darn self.  You get the impression that the author wants you to root for the marriage between these two, but I found that difficult since no evidence that the two are actually right for each other, or that they make each other happy, is presented.  It's like if you have a friend who always calls you to complain about his or her spouse - if you always just hear the negatives, you're going to hate the significant other.  That being said, despite the portrayal of the characters, I was interested enough in the story to stay up late finishing to learn the outcome, which turned out to be a let down, in my opinion.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Not bad.  Great creature effects save what would otherwise be a cheesy movie.  What would have been Beowulf reborn for the Nth time is instead quite unique.  The acting is meek, a sad display considering some of the talent in the film.  The monster is awesome- Gimme a hour and a half of the creature destroying stuff and I'd be happy.
0143118420|2.0|I noticed a lot of people had really positive or really negative reactions to the book.  I chose to listen to it on audio book  because I love to travel and liked the concept of the author taking off the discover herself. I can't say that I really hated it. I was just hoping for more.  It was kind of boring.  The author would be describing an interesting conversation and suddenly state that she was not going to say anymore about this.  This happened several times and I wanted to hear more about it. I'm really surprised that it's being made into a movie.  I can't see it being entertaining.
B0025L5YCG|5.0|These DVD sets consist of the extended versions of The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Are they worth the money? Yes. If you are a dedicated fan of the Lord of the Rings, this set would be something you would feel you cannot live without. If you are not already a dedicated fan of LotR, watching these DVDs would probably make you into one. The extended scenes alone are worth the purchase of these sets, and there are many other enjoyable aspects: commentary by actors, explanations for the special effects, much that a fan will find fascinating. The extended scenes do much to contribute to the stories, and flesh out the characters in a way that the theatrical releases did not, and buying the DVD sets together like this is economically sensible.
B003W9I9JU|4.0|My previous review about no sound seems to have been deleted.   I heard back from customer service the same day, with a promise to contact me, but I received no contact after the first.   However, the next day, I started to view the episode on my computer.  Found the sound restored, then downloaded (with credit restored) to my TIVO.    For me, this was a frustrating episode.   Personally, I prefer one complete episode rather than a three episode finale.   After one look, my husband said that they were trying to unsuccessfully top the Cliff Hanger in Season 1 of Andromeda.        Still, leaving three major characters in trouble leaves one wondering how they would be able to get out of the mess, and it also gives the writers three different corners to write themselves out of.    It never dawned on me what the monster in the Pandora Box was.   I'm back to speculating about what Riversong is.   The Riversong character in the Matt Smith episodes seems less in awe of the Doctor than in the library episodes with David Tennant.   I wonder if that's because Riversong seems physically older than the Doctor at this point, while in the library episodes, she was closer to his own age.   I don't remember the Sweety reference in the library episodes.   She's also a younger more roguish Riversong.   And seems to have a love hate relationship.  \\"If he's dead, I'll never forgive you, and if he's alive, I'll never forgive him.\\"  But later she refers to him as \\"my love.\\"  Wondering how long they'll stretch out the story arc.   If Riversong really is the Doctor's daughter, they could stretch out the relationship indefinitely.  To me, the sweety reference seems more like a nickname between family, and relationships would be strange if the father looks younger than the daughter.   I also wonder why they didn't bump into Captain Jack Harkness, since he's from the same time period that Riversong had been imprisoned.       A nice monster reunion from the creatures they'd brought out since the 2005 version of Doctor Who began.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|\\"Life\\" DVD is one of the most remarkable documentary movies I've ever seen. It is created by the BBC Earth team who released similar works, such as the \\"Planet Earth - as you've never seen it before\\" and the \\"Nature's Most Amazing Events\\". All these movies share a similar structure describing our beautiful and bizarre planet with their inhabitants, as well as few descriptions of a challenging event, such as filming in the water with prey and predators, waiting many days for an expected event to happen, and so on. The BBC Earth team spent three years of continuous efforts to produce this marvelous piece of work.   Although similar with the above mentioned documentary movies, \\"Life\\" has a slightly different structure. The first episode of disc one, \\"Challenges of Life\\" describes a summary of how many species of animals and plants live on Earth followed by few short sequences that most of us didn't get the chance to see. For instance, this introductive episode describes the hunting technique of dolphins, the band of brother cheetahs hunting an ostrich, the chameleon hunting insects, the surviving of a sea lion from an orca attack, the flying fish away from the predators, the feeding technique of capuchins, the Venus Flytrap plant, the stalk-eye insect, the fighting hippo for mate, the grebes courtship ritual, the octopus ultimate sacrifice for brood, the poison arrow frog motherhood, the chinstrap penguin survival, the orangutan motherhood. The most challenging episode was filming in Antarctica.     The following episodes contain a description of the previous events as well as others in more details and in a larger context. These are: \\"Reptiles and Amphibians\\", \\"Mammals\\", \\"Fish\\", \\"Birds\\", \\"Insects\\", \\"Hunters and Hunted\\", \\"Creatures of the Deep\\", \\"Plants\\", and \\"Primates\\". All episodes contain astonishing events, but perhaps the most amazing one is about the \\"Jesus Christ Lizard\\" able to walk on water to run from its predators.  I wish I could have these films when I wasa student in middle and high schools. My children are luckier as they've already got the chance to see these educational movies. I strongly recommend you to get the chance to see these films.

B00095NX9G|5.0|Serpentine is brilliant! - Both the dancer and the DVD.     I'm not a fan of tribal belly dance and I'm so impressed with the quality of this DVD. It is superb in content, instruction and choreography. I'm mostly impressed by Rachel's instruction: she is clear, direct and concise. She goes to the point and tells you exactly what you need to know. The way Rachel Brice presents herself and the dance studio location give me the feel that I'm in an individual class, just Rachel and I. It feels really personal and doable! It delivers what it promises. I can not see people getting disappointed with this buy.     The drills by themselves stand alone. They are lots of fun and a serious, very complete workout that makes me sweat. The yoga portions are very adequate, basic beginner's yoga that anybody can do. The 'full bow' pose could be the hardest asana for yoga newbies, but that's about it, nothing impossible here that nobody will get better over time. The yoga here is mainly focused on back bending and consists mostly in alternations of downward-dogs, modified planks (chaturanga dandasana) and upward-dogs (not official sun salutations). Since this is not a yoga DVD, I don't have anything to complain about. All I can assure is that the more yoga you practice, the better your dancing becomes and viceversa. Casually, I started vinyasa yoga and belly dance almost simultaneously, 4 yrs ago and was surprised of what a bomb they are together -ever since, I have been practicing and loving them both. Yoga and belly dance work in amazing, synergistic ways and Rachel does a nice job integrating them both in a single DVD.     The choreographies and performances are great! I love the fact that Rachel did NOT choose really easy, silly choreographies that you'll get bored over time. They are beautiful-to-watch, fun-to-do and APPROPRIATELLY challenging. Any dancer will be able to master the two choreographies with practice because Rachel dissects them in a very nice, easy way. I may havemixed feelings regarding the music tracts for the choreographies but nothing worth to take off a star. Tract in choreography #2 is lovely Hungarian classical music; sublime and seductive with the real serpentine feel. Tract in choreography #1 is Mexican band music (música de banda de México), with the tuba a striking instrument. I don't like this track because, agreeing with a previous reviewer, it gives me the feeling of a circus. (But it's all about taste and some Mexican belly dancers may really love it.) I got over this and truly enjoy Rachel's grace on displaying her art in any rhythm. Her performances are stunning and her customs are to die for. Again, one of Rachel's performance tracts takes me back to the circus, but again, I admired her grace and art instead. After all, out-of-the-box music -hideous for some, (me included) - is what tribal fusion it's all about.     Clearly, tribal fusion is not for everybody. It's not my style of belly dance (classic Raqs sharqi and Middle Eastern music are more my league) but I can appreciate the quality and inarguable talent of what the tribal princess, Miss Rachel Brice, offers here. End note: You don't have to be a hard-core tribal fan to enjoy this DVD. The belly dance technique presented here is a hard-to-find jewel that many of us haven't found anywhere else. This DVD is for any belly dance lover -any- tribal or not!     Bravo Rachel!

B0016HMYEQ|4.0|For all of u that dont care about the movie facts and want to know is this movie good or bad I would say a good movie and if you like monster movies this is for you I have seen many monster films and this one is close to the top of my favs because this movie has a different view of thing instead of feeling like ur watching a godzilla or king kong film when there is little that people do in the film and the story is about monsters this film makes u feel like your part of the people that are running from this monster for instance the whole film is supposed to make u feel like your watching a hand held camera's home movie filmed by the main characters best friend   SO for me  this movie gets 4 out of 5 stars because i wanted to see a little bit more of the monster and get some detailed views but for what i got instead was still good i recommend that any who like godzilla see this .
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This was my first taste to \\"trailer music.\\"  While looking at electronica bands, I somehow stumbled across an album with some sweet looking Maximus/Gladiator/300 guy on its cover with the word \\"INVINCIBLE\\" across it.  It had a butload of tracks and was just too cool and so much what I was not looking for that I had to get it.    I'm happy I did that.    This whole album basically makes you want to rip off your shirt, grab a sword, and charge straight into some overwhelming army because you feel \\"invincible\\".  (yeah, a bit corny I know.)  I'm a landscaper, though, and when I turn on this music, nothing can stop me.    Simply put, this is man music that makes men feel they can do anything.  Great for sports, hard work, movie making, and wanting to feel heroic.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|With nearly 1,500 reviews having been posted to date, perhaps everything has already been said about this movie.  Nevertheless, I'd like to add my voice to help give this movie the praise it deserves, and to counter the negative reviewers, who are apparently in a mood to be hypercritical, are right-wing hardliners, and/or are inappropriately rating the Blu-Ray package rather than the movie itself.<br /><br />For me, this movie goes well beyond simply being a movie.  Rather, it's like a voyage to another world which is, at the same time, oddly familiar.  True, many of the characters are closer to caricatures, but that approach works in this movie because it brings into focus the distinct messages of each character, and the characters together cover a reasonably diverse spectrum of types.  In other words, the elements of this movie are simple, but they're woven together in a complex way which is emotionally powerful and thematically profound.  In particular, the theme which jumped out to me most prominently was the overt similarity to the culture, spirituality, and history of the Native Americans (and other indigenous groups around the world), except that the Native Americans obviously met with a much sadder ending.  To the extent that viewers missed this theme (very few reviews mention it), that's an unfortunate reflection of our society's lack of knowledge regarding both history and the oppression and exploitation going on in the world today.<br /><br />On a more technical note, of course the tremendous visuals and special effects are vital to making this voyage possible.  The Blu-Ray is excellent in this regard, with a clarity and vividness which almost surpasses reality, but seeing the movie in 3D in the theater is also an experience not to be missed.<br /><br />Needless to say, I very highly recommended this movie.  This is one of only a handful of movies that I've ever purchased rather than rented.  Cynics will point to the amount of profit this movie is generating but, in this case, it's arguably well deserved.t's arguably well deserved.

B003O6R5KU|4.0|This film continues the story of Ip Man 1. He was considered one of the best of the Wing Chun martial artists and Bruce Lee's oringinal teacher. I am a Tai Chi teacher so stories like this interest me. Although it was great to see Sammo Hung (who is one of the best martial actors in China) I was a little disappointed in the story line especially the ending. It was a little too cliche and reminded me of too many of the plots from other movies. Ip Man 1 was more interesting in that it showed how he became a great fighter and how he always kept the principles of his art through thick and thin.     I would recommend this movie, however as I like the star Donnie Yen and the way he represented Ip Man. It still has plenty of action and the plot is definitely worth seeing.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I have no doubt that this movie will look and sound spectacular in blu-ray, but the current price ($62.99) is more than I want to spend for a single movie. I'm imagining that it will come with lots of extras like the initial Gone With The Wind blu-ray and then a few month later a single disc version will be released at a lower price. I hope that they provide some details soon.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I've said that about so many movies but the euphoria passes about some time after it's done. So I figured I'd wait 24 hours to see if this euphoria has passed... looks like it hasn't. Bram Stoker's Dracula was my favorite movie, I now have to reconsider.<br /><br />Inception is an AMAZING movie. For one, it has one of the most interesting plots I've ever had the good fortune to witness. Look at it. Stealing/planting ideas through dreams. Entering others' dreams. Completing tasks in dreams. This stuff is what I like. The plot was very complex and multi-layered, and therefore there was so much to offer in the plot. Not a single moment went by where I wasn't interested.<br /><br />The visuals are AMAZING. I was blown away when Cobb was showing Ellen Page how the dream world worked, with the folding city. As well as the scenery in the Arctic. The sets looked vivid and gorgeous. They complemented the film's great plot and IMO, were very creepy and brooding too.<br /><br />Another reason the movie is so great is because it uses ambiguity THE RIGHT WAY. A lot of filmmakers (*ahem* Michael Haneke, I'm looking at you!!!!) think that senseless manipulation equals a great movie (to a lot of people nowadays think it does and because of it, they rave about it like it's second coming of Jesus), and this one doesn't senselessly manipulate the viewer. It challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle and find out the answer. Yet it has plenty of exciting action and suspense to offer, and it doesn't beat you over the head with the theme. You're getting your adrenaline up during the action while simultaneously piecing the puzzle together.<br /><br />The ending. WOW. I'll be thinking about this one for at least a month. It uses ambiguity the right way too- I am personally leaning towards the \\"he's still dreaming\\" side, but I definitely like the ending a lot because he could be in the real world too. My friend and I both decided last night that he's lost his mind and is in limbo, but that's what makes the ending so powerful. You interpret it your own way. See this is what I wish a lot of the pretentious directors who go for the \\"open to interpretation\\" approach did more often- end it AFTER the resolution of the conflict and then leave the one element up to the viewer to decide. It can be interpreted many ways.<br /><br />The movie is VERY long. 2 hours 28 minutes. But it didn't feel long at all!! I seriously thought it was only 1 hour 45 minutes. That's the thing, when you're so into a movie, when your attention is drawn to it for that long, when you're trying to piece together the puzzle, time flies so fast. I didn't even get up from my seat once and mind you I'm VERY bad for having to go to the bathroom.<br /><br />Last night I lay wide awake in bed thinking about the movie. I tried to sleep but I couldn't. The movie was very powerful, it made me think about it. I was thinking about it on the way home from the IMAX. My friend and I were talking about it the whole way (and ruining it for people on the bus lol). It goes to show you how powerful a movie can be. It leaves you thinking, and I'm STILL thinking about it as I type this. I am really glad I saw it.<br /><br />As over the top as I may sound, I am not trying to sound over the top. I really loved it. WAY more than the Dark Knight. I'm seeing it again on Wednesday, and I cannot wait.

B002ZG98LO|5.0|A very good entertaining solid action film. You knew with Robert Rodriguez and a very capable director Nimrod Antal, you knew this be good. The plot and story is pretty thin but then again so was the plot of the original Predator film.     The good thing about the film starting off is that obviously you don't need to have watched the first film to watch this. Originally Robert and Nimrod said this was a \\"sequel\\". It doesn't quite fit the bill as a sequel as it only briefly mentions the events of the first film and that's about it, but that don't matter.    So anyways, the plot of the film about a group of selected \\"participants\\" who arrive on a planet inhabited by the Predators works well largely to the great cast, tension, slow buildup, and eventually the action scenes that we come to expect.    The script is good enough to give us a taste of every character though some characters stick out more than others obviously.     Adrian Brody has the lead as the mercenary \\"Royce\\" while Alice Braga is a nice supporting character in Isabella. Rounding out the cast is Topher Grace as a doctor who doesn't quite belong here with the other targets. Walton Goggins, Laurence Fishburne, Danny Trejo, Oleg Taktaro all have nice parts in the film.     I think the character development is good enough. I mean this obviously supposed to a survival horror type of action film, so we weren't going to get a lot, but you know they picked the characters to expand and the ones that they did expand were good choices such as Fishburne's Noland character. He doesn't have a big part, but gives you the idea of what's it like to be a survivor among the Predators. Adrian has a big enough part obviously as the lead to portray part of his hired gun persona.    I liked the slow buildup, Nimrod and the writers for the film don't show off the Predators right of the bat instead have us gradually becoming aware of the presence as the targets are knocked off.  Then from there the action scenes and tension arepulled really well, and the cast for the film is perfect.     Then once the action is halted, Robert and Nimrod know when to take a break, and then the characters cope with the situation.     This was a very well polished action movie.    There were a couple of big names and some other names that while they be recognized \\"big\\" actors are all actors with a lot experience.    The script also has a lot of memorable scenes and quotes like Laurence's \\"You talk to loud\\", and \\"I am the one that got away, the one you **beep** with\\".    Some people mentioned they were afraid about the casting, and some of the choices. For me, I didn't Adrian could pull of the lead, but after reading interviews with him from the directors and how he wanted the role.     All in all a great film for Predator fans.
B000000HX0|5.0|I'm not normally into 90s alternative rock. In fact I usually am a heavy metal person (but I like anything that isn't country or rap) and I simply love this album. The Pumpkins rule, and this album proves it! This may be their best album. It begins on a rising note with Cherub Rock which is a popular citicism on Indie Rock, then we get Quiet, possibly my favorite Pumpkins song, and Today, the big hit, which is a really fun and awesome song. The ballads are great too, like Disarm. One song that is great: Silverf--k. Holy crap! That song has some of the sickest drumming I've ever heard. It clocks in at 8 minutes and despite its weird and totally random title, it's a fun as hell song that would work well in a fight scene in a movie! This album is really great, and especially in vinyl, where you can hear each and every layer of music there is, particularly the depth of the bass. Buy this, I say, especially in vinyl. You won't believe your ears!

B000F1IQNM|4.0|Nanny McPhee is successful on many levels, which is what makes it so appealing. The story is engaging, even for adults. The 7 children of recently widowed actor Colin Firth are acting out because of their mother's death. The actors are enchanting, from Emma Thompson to Angela Lansbury to the children. The setting (19th century England?) is visually sumptuous, as are the costumes and makeup. This movie recalls Mary Poppins, although it's not a ripoff of that movie.    There's even a prosocial message buried within the story: Everyone, including children, has a need for structure, respect and love. Blended families might find this movie especially appealing because the concept of stepmothers is addressed gently but realistically.    The only aspect I didn't like was the inclusion computer-generated animation on some animals. I would have preferred this to remain a simple, timeless story with elements of myth without a talking donkey.

B002UD56I6|5.0|Michael Jackson was a huge part of my life when I was a teenager, and I remained a fan for a lot of my older years, but I never got to see him in concert. I am kicking myself now, because I suppose we all think we have time to catch up on things.     It was a great thing to be able to see him in this film. I got to see him not only sing and dance again but to hear his kind words to people. Just because he was kind didn't mean he wasn't the boss though. He was the boss with L.O.V.E.       He is sorely missed by me because of the human factor (going too soon and leaving his children behind), and you could not have paid me a million dollars to not own this movie.

0810993139|5.0|Middle School. I don't know of anyone who remembers that time of their life as being fabulous. It's so filled with change and coming to grips with the larger reality of looming adulthood, and the prospect of dealing with members of the opposite gender on 'new terms', and harder schoolwork, that it fairly dims in light of the fun of elementary school and high school. And perhaps that's why this book about an average boy trying to find his place resonates with kids.<br /><br />It was certainly popular with my children. Both of them brought it home as soon as they were able to read it themselves. The Word-of-Mouth of their peers having brought it to their attention.<br /><br />Myself, I didn't start reading the series until just recently when my 8 year-old son brought it home. He had already read it once and then we read it again together. The fact that he read it twice should tell you something: THIS isn't just another kid book.<br /><br />I was surprised at how funny the book was. There were times when I just cracked up and at least one time where I had to stop reading until I could pull myself together.<br /><br />THE SKINNY:::<br /><br />\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" is written in clear, easy to understand language at the 5.2 (early Fifth Grade) Accelerated Reading level. Jeff Kinney is an observant and funny writer and the cartoon drawings add to the fun.<br /><br />The appeal of this book is from about 2nd Grade through 7th--although I thought it was great too.<br /><br />I want to HIGHLY recommend this series to parents of Boys and 'Reluctant Readers'. My observations --confirmed by teachers and librarians-- is that these books really appeal to kids.

B003PGNBO8|5.0|I'd only seen a few promotional spots for it, but thought It looked interesting enough. The 1st episode blew me AWAY. Awesome plot, and story idea. One never done on t.v. before to my knowledge. Never lost interest, and the season only got better near the end with the most DRAMATIC and DRAMA filled season finale I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of season finales in my nearly 28 of whatever of that was t.v. watching, lol. Not a show to be missed at all, it tackles math, science, the talk of fate and free will, the space time continuum, is mysterious, and has both the remnance of a cop show, being that it's the FBI investigating it, and doctordom. It has a little big of almost everything.   One of the first GREATEST SHOWS to come along in at least a decade, and 10 years is a long time to be watching different shows that come on over time. This show is a GRAND SLAM. it's so mysterious, and EVERY SINGLE EPISODE ends with a jaw dropping  scene or a twist at the end, of which I've NEVER known another show to pull that off. It's a must not miss show. It's dramatic, thought provoking, and the end of every previous episode makes you want to see then next one. It's a no brainer, one of the best show I've EVER WATCHED, and it's what a show SHOULD BE!!   You won't be sorry.

It wasn't a movie I was desperate to have, but the price Amazon is asked it's a great way to nudge your cart into Super Saver Shipping territory.

B0036EH3WU|1.0|I was the biggest Lost fan that I knew. I listened to dozens of podcast about the show every week. I never missed an episode and I regularly visited dozens of message boards and by the end I was a regular guest on a podcast about Lost.    It was a great show, with so many fantastic mysteries that just had to lead to a big picture. Season one was fantastic, season two was great, season three slipped a little, but ended on a very high note and with the promise that everything was going to be answered with the end date the gave of 6 seasons. However, by the middle of the sixth season the writers were backtracking and trying to convince us it was about the characters.     Lost had great characters, it's true, but they were only part of it. The mysteries are what kept us watching. The mysteries are why we watched the show and while things like unexplained character motivations, odd circumstance and strange events happened throughout the show you had faith in the writers that it would all come together in the end. Afterall they said it would all mean something....they promised.    That didn't even remotely happen. Don't lie to yourself because if you were to rewatch the show it will still be a series of confusing, almost non-sensical events. No 15 minutes of extra footage can help that. It's not a complete story it is an exercise in using the new media and cliffhangers to create a successful television show and then use that same medium to convince loyal viewers that the reasons they watched were not really the reasons.     Season 6, the final season of the show is one of the worst things to ever be on television. The show had fabulous actors, but they were all zombies in this season and not just the 2 that were supposed to be. They mindlessly walked through the sets and every episode was just stalling until the final one where the writers would give us one last twist that the flash sideways was an afterlife. Not only that, but it made the first 5 seasons unrewatchable.The writers couldn't tie any of it together so they preyed upon our emotions and tried to use it against our logical brains that were screaming \\"FOUL!\\". It worked on some of us, those that are praising the final season, but a very large amount of people are still fuming about this after almost 3 months. How can you try and convince me that all the things we all talked about over the last 6 years didn't matter because they all ended up together after they died? What about a cohesive plot?     There is no reason to buy this box set. Most of us have the first 5 good seasons on dvd, or Itunes and they are actually free on Netflix to watch instantly. So why bother? Season 6 is worse than any Star Wars prequel or Indiana Jones by a longshot, putting it in a box with all the rest of the show doesn't change anything.

B001NS9BCQ|2.0|After a horrible car accident in 1987 that left his right hand in shambles, Yngwie Malmsteen bravely recorded Odyssey with fresh singer Joe Lynn Turner.  It all sounds great on paper:  Yngwie returning from an injury, new songs with a slightly Pop-ier sound to them and another Rainbow front man to sing them (like Graham Bonnet in Alcatraz).  But what looks good on paper doe not always transition sonically.  While Yngwie bravely returns to form on solos on \\"Rising Force\\" and \\"Dreaming,\\" a lot of errant notes and sloppy neoclassical runs happen every now and then.  I don't blame the man - for he was recovering from nerve damage.  But it doesn't make it any easier to hear the solos.         Joe Lynn Turner shines on the more Glam-AOR friendly numbers like \\"Dreaming\\" (which is a solid ballad) and the Poppy #2 track \\"Hold On\\" (where he shines vocally).  \\"Deja-Vu\\" is another good number, a complex bit of riffing on the bass & guitar.         All in all, Yngwie's tone comes across a bit more metallic (if not shimmery) compared to his beautiful guitar tones from the Alcatraz days and on his first 2 solo albums.  The loss in guitar sound obstructs some of the solo sections as well.  I recommend: \\"Rising Force\\", \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Crystal Ball\\" if you like Pop Metal.  For a shredder - this is a weak offering.  Avoid \\"Heaven Tonight\\" at all costs.
0061122416|4.0|I'm reviewing this book after my second read of this book.  The story is mediocre.  Very simple.  Almost as if someone from junior high school set out to write a book.  But it is a very worthwhile read because of the spiritual insights of the book.  One of the primary lessons of the book, from page 22:  \\"To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.  All things are one.  And when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.\\"  Follow your dreams, your heart's desires.  Follow the \\"omens.\\"
B003J27WFW|5.0|Neil Peart is the Nerd Zen Master.  The man has an impressive list of accomplishments that doesn't include playing  skull-crushing drum fills (like the ones in Natural Science).  He has written the novels  \\"Radiance Over the Rockies\\" and \\"The Masked Rider.\\"   He is an avid bicyclist and motorcyclist.  Most bravely, he dealt with the deaths of his wife and teenage daughter in less than a year's span.  I can't imagine how he dealt with something like that.  He has achieved more artistically than any other Nerd in his age group.  The Rush cult worships his every move;  every drum fill and every odd metered beat.  He can do no wrong.  I also happen to love this gentlemen... the epitome of the quiet genius.      The documentary is loaded with very rare clips and songs from the late 60's.  Many fun surprises are pulled out of the vault.  Best of all - they talk in length about the albums \\"Caress of Steel\\" (swank), \\"Hemispheres\\" (boringly swank) and \\"Farewell To Kings\\" (Breathtakingly Swank).  This period of output from Rush is so completely over the top that you either love it or ignore it.  Simple as that.  A song like \\"Circumstances\\" is either perfect or garbage.  The band was so good at crafting Prog Art in the 1970's that it left the rock critics with their hands tied.  They had no choice but to ravage them - chastising them for being conceited Canadians with poetry lyrics and no sense of rhythm or style.  To put it simply, Rolling Stone magazine hated them.  Case closed.  If you want to give Rush a try - give one of those three records a spin.  (note: 2112 is overrated)    The bonus DVD is loaded with amazing fun:  Rush Nerd conventions, an ALEX section deleted from the final cut, a short PRESTO section, and best of all - Geddy trying to explain why they had a rap section on the track \\"Roll The Bones.\\"           The documentary showed me so much more about the alienated spirit that inhabits the Rush mythos.  Peart understands much about being alone.  He is the shaman of the alienated nerd in us all.  If you love RUSH - check this one out.  They got it right this time and let some of those elusive secrets fly free.  It taught me one thing for certain:  Doing things your way is the only way.
B002BWP4A6|4.0|\\"The White Ribbon\\" is a kind of extended parable that has no clear resolution. An older man (Ernst Jacobi) recalls the strange events in a German village where he was employed as a schoolteacher in his younger days, just before World War I. He believes what he observed there might hold a clue to socio-political trends in Germany in subsequent decades. He says it all began with the Doctor's riding accident in the summer of 1913. The Doctor and his horse were felled by a trip wire, placed by persons unknown. Soon after, a woman dies in an accident in the saw mill. Just as the villagers have put these events behind them, they are shocked by a crime more sinister and disturbing. Horror gives way to suspicion and distrust. Even the Baron cannot insulate his family from the malice, brutality, and \\"perverse acts of revenge\\" that seem to have no clear cause or end.<br /><br />The crimes are upsetting, but their purpose is vague. That contributes to the feeling of unease. It's hardly surprising that the village is a little Peyton Place, where behavior behind closed doors defies the strict discipline and religious devotion of the townspeople. The Doctor (Rainer Bock), Pastor (Burghart Klaussner), and Baron (Ulrich Tukor) are prominent men in the community. But the Doctor is abusive toward his family and mistress. The Puritanical Pastor berates and humiliates his children for their imperfections but is ill-equipped to deal with serious transgressions. The Baron is careless and willfully ignorant of the needs of his farmers and his family. They're not much to admire. And a group of children, led by the Pastor's pubescent daughter Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) and son Martin (Leonard Proxauf), are always present where tragedy strikes.<br /><br />What does it all mean? No one seems to have any clear idea. A clairvoyant young woman who warns of impending tragedy is at first ignored, then blamed, for the act. That's an obvious metaphor, but \\"The White Ribbon\\" asks more questions than it answers. The stark white-out cinematography, the snow that blankets the village, the white ribbons that the Pastor forces his children to wear are a show of innocence that the whole village wears on its sleeve. It hides a great deal of barbarism and, apparently, a genuinely sinister element. But is it the crimes that are supposed to horrify us? Or the reaction to them? Or the lack of reaction? Surely, the villagers' hypocrisy is commonplace. And what do the children know? Is \\"The White Ribbon\\" thoughtful or specious? It's strength is that its mystery and its provocative themes are enough to keep the audience asking those questions for 2 1/2 hours and to get people talking about it afterward.

Let's get scary and disturbing again! PLEASE! Let's be done with this kind of movie... The only redeeming aspect was the performance of the mother, who carried the role in a convincing manner that transcended the otherwise terrible film, and her acting alone may be part of the reason that this movie gets any love at all. Given what she had to work with, she is the standout element of this movie, and she did her best to save it.<br /><br />Bring back the real horror, PLEASE, and give Vera Farmiga a role more deserving of her talent, because it's wasted on garbage like this.
