B008G8SFGO|5.0|.....they do better than anyone else, and that is ROCK.  Plain and simple. And fun.  Nobody lookin' for a Grammy here....just turn it up LOUD!<br /><br />And I have to say Gene sounds real good here.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am having so much fun with this game but get frustrated sometimes.  My granddaughter plays it on my Kindle and she is so much better than I am.  Guess you have to be young to be really good.  But I will keep trying!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app. I hare to admit it but I'm addicted to Pintrest there would be a few things I would change,  like making it smoother but other than that I love it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was excellent, it has a great story line and it just draws you in. Can't wait for the next book to come out
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The story moved a bit slow after you got into the rhythm of their routine. I was glad I hung on and continued reading because it was well worth it.  The story is very believable. I loved the ending!
0525953728|4.0|Excellent book.  The type you don't want to put down / stop reading.  I don't see what all the commotion is about, just as much was said by the media and politicians.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Easy game, pretty, and it's just the kind of game to rel&agrave;x.  No heavy thinking, and fun  for filling in time, or waiting at the doctor's office.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|The perfect mix of mellow and relaxing, as well energy and purpose. This album runs you through a spectrum of emotions and you'll be more than happy to take in every song. Well worth the money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading, but still I could not put the book aside until I finished it. Easy reading and very captivating.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|The author was able to pull me in within 15 pages which I think is excellent. I couldn't put my Kindle down because I wanted to know what was going to happen to Asha and her family, both biological and adopted. I cried reading the ending.! Great stuff! I think there is room for the author to write a sequel.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I don't know how many reviews I've already written so other readers out there know how good this book is! Let's start out by pointing out that it's a sexual book, with lots of profanity and violence. But not to the point where you'll be completely disgusted and have nightmares, nah not that bad.<br />Travis, your male heartthrob, is to die for. You'll grow so fond of him. He's very hot tempered, protective, loving and a biiiit immature. You'll want to yell at him at times and have him for yourself at others. He's crazy. Abby is a sweet, nice, smart girl. She has her hidden secrets and wants a future completely different from what she's experienced. You'll grow to like her too, and yes you will also want to smack her at times for being stubborn and letting pride take over. The book is a roller coaster ride, you will really be feeling different emotions every maybe 25 pages? and you'll LOVE IT. It is very addictive <3 So from me to you... READ IT.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|My wife doesn't like the look but I think it's awesome.  Truly something every Walking Dead fan should buy if they can spare the money.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I have never seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production of Phantom of the Opera, but I have reread the book at least once a year since late elementary school. The Phantom is one of the best books ever written. Erik is one of the best characters ever created. When I saw Webber was producing a film version, I was very excited. Finally, a way to see the stage production without going to NYC :)<br /><br />The costumes and sets are sumptous. The tension between Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom is believable and has real depth. I loved the music, which of course is taken directly from the stage production.<br /><br />This film has the romance, the drama, the beauty, the music, everything I would have expected.<br /><br />As for performances, there are so many things I can say. Patrick Wilson shows not only acting but singing chops in a strong performance as Raoul, the Phantom's competitor for Christine's affections. His voice is as beautiful as his face, and he makes a believable suitor for Christine. Emmy Rossum was captivating as Christine. Her voice is gorgeous, and her youthful beauty only adds to the character's appeal. She sings like an angel and performs like a prima donna. Minor characters like Minnie Driver's Carlotta and Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry steal the spotlight in their scenes, and make the movie very enjoyable. Driver gives the film some much-needed humor as the terrible singer and Richardson injects some background information on Erik and her own association with him. She also advises the new owners of the Opera Populaire and Raoul later on, when the fit hits the shan and the opera house catches fire after a sabotage by the phantom himself.<br /><br />Now to the Phantom himself. Gerard Butler's performance (vocals and acting) have been dissected by many, but I will tell you why his is my favorite Phantom. Butler's performance is provocative and nuanced throughout the film. He begins as just the mentor, stealing peeks at Christine as she performsher aria, calling \\"brava\\" while she lights a candle afterward. When she returns to her room, he sings to her and shows himself for the first time. All you see is the mysterious mask over the right side of his face and you hear a deep, raspy (and yes, untrained) voice luring Christine through the mirror. When she joins him and you see them heading to his lair beneath the opera house, he turns his head and there's the rest of the face we've been waiting for. It's a beautiful face, too. I cannot tell a lie.<br /><br />Even from his first frames, Butler is mesmerizing. He's a more sexual Phantom than others. He's opening Christine's eyes and mind to her baser desires, trying to bind her to him that way, but he's also discovering his own seemingly for the first time. There's a vulnerability to Butler's Phantom that makes him almost childlike. You feel the hope the Phantom feels. He's a grown man with all the implied desires and needs, but inside he's just a hopeful little boy who wants to be loved and accepted. Butler has a raw sexual charisma that carries the character through his attempts to seduce Christine through music. When he sings \\"Music of the Night\\" in his lair, he is very much in control and yet still completely vulnerable. If she chooses to leave, you know he will be devastated. Rossum's and Butler's voices together in \\"Don Juan Triumphant\\" create a sexual tension that's palpable. And again, there's the bald-faced hope of a child trying to be loved. While he holds Christine captive and threatens Raoul's life, his desperation and longing come to a head and you see a man in love. A man who needs to know he is loved in return. When Christine kisses him you see a man being kissed possibly for the first time in his life. You watch his heart break. He sits and cries afterward watching his music box play and I cry right along with him. Butler delivers an emotional and utterly devastating performance. Period.<br /><br />Now for the part of the film I find people aremost critical about. I felt Butler's voice in my heart. The Phantom is an exposed nerve left raw by neglect and abuse, and Butler's voice captured his hurt and his hope. This was a man wearing his heart on his sleeve and the emotion of that bled through into his voice. He may not be radio-ready but dammit, I loved his performance. Gerard Butler is my favorite Phantom and will remain so.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it more than 50 shades of grey!! It is a great love and obsession without the bondage! Amazing read!!
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Game is fun when youre bored or have nothing else to do.Sorta like Mario Kart except with Pac man of course.The only thing I dont like is when I press the arrows to turn it sometimes doesnt or it does too late or too long.Other than that,the game itself is ok.

0307477479|5.0|Prepare for a lot of time-hopping in this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel; and just about the time you decide it's not working, you find out that it is indeed.  Jennifer Egan has done a fine job of capturing the angst of today's society, particularly of the music world, and she has infused an intricate plot with excellent character development.  It's one of those novels that, as you read it, you say:  \\"I couldn't have written this.\\"  It's also a ballsy work of fiction that confronts the reader directly at times.  Ultimately, it's about saying goodbye and moving on with what's left of your life.  Excellent job, Jennifer!
B005974CNA|1.0|I own the vinyl version btw.<br /><br />ADTOE is a useless DT album. The creative spark left with the kicking out of Mike Portnoy (one of my favourite musicians), and it shows rather \\"dramatically\\" on this album. The songs are as unimaginative as their crappy titles, and after listening to the album at least 5 times right now I can't remember any part of it save for one or two choruses! Such a bland album is really not needed for a band with such a strong back catalogue. The previous 2 albums, sc and bcasl revealed a downward trend for the band (which is not exactly surprising after a long career), but this album really takes the cake of uncreativity and blandness. I know the fanboys will suck up everything the band puts out, but if you have the ears to compare this record and the band's earlier work, you should know this is the album where the dream finally died.<br /><br />The live show accompaning this album left me equally disappointed (it's not that Mangini would be a bad drummer, but face it, Mike P was the face of the band). Poor set list and no stage presence. Only way to save at least this side is play full-length shows again (2 sets! varied setlists!) and get Mike back ASAP.<br /><br />PS: I almost forgot to mention the ATROCIOUS album cover. it sucks!
193413712X|5.0|Some say the character development is weak in this Pulitzer Prize-winning work.  I disagree.  In fact, the hallmark of this fine work is the multi-layered interior detail of the dying grandfather and, in another time, his father.  There is a surprise ending of sorts, which works, and an intricacy of the poetic language that is very pleasing, although set amid grim, sheer desperation and failure at many turns. The author's profound knowledge of watch-making is also impressive.  All in all, Tinkers scores big with the human heart.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|Opeth claimed they were paying tribute to old prog rock with this album - but then why does it sound nothing like it!? Production is awful on this album, there are so many quiet or downright SILENT passages it's not believable. Songs (which can hardly be called that) appear and disappear without making any impression whatsoever, the writing is so bad it has to be experienced to be believed. In fact, don't even recommend this sleeping pill to your worst enemy. Truly atrocious! If you run out of ideas, quit the band instead of releasing half-assed GARBAGE like this.<br /><br />And for the record, I don't disapprove this album because is mellow, I like Damnation a lot.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was such an intense book.  I read it in under 24 hours.  I almost didn't read this book because of a negative review.  That person obviously had no clue.  It did take a few chapters to get used to the one chapter being when in the present time and the next chapter being in the past.  But I think it was easy to follow.  The first few chapters focus on OCD and I thought, oh is this what the whole book will be like?  But it was just to let the reader have a feel for what OCD really is.  I think the author did a good job of letting you understand how Catherine aquired her OCD habits.<br /><br />This story was so intense and riviting.  I didn't want to go to bed.  I wanted to stay awake and read it all.  This story was very realistic and believable. At times you even liked Lee and felt a little sorry for him.  The ending was so perfect that I read the last page three times.  I wish there could be a continuation. I would definitely recommend this book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Excellent series, the best I've seen. I would recommend this series to those who like terrorism and politics all tied into one program. The subject of terrorism is very current indeed!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it, so looking forward to Entwined with you but disappointed they changed the release date from Dec 31st to May 7th :(
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I recently watched the 25th anniversary of the phantom on the television and was once again blown away by the music and just overall \\"wowness\\", so purchased this version as I was very pleasantly surprised when I first saw it at the cinema years ago at Gerard Butler's voice.So at the moment I have not opened it to view again, think I will keep it for properity, because the price was so good.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun game... good time waster.  Graphics are pretty good.  The levels get more challenging and sometimes the time limit just isn't enough to finish.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Tried several file manager apps and FTP clients on my phone. This is by far the best all around app for these that I've found. I recommend it to everyone looking for a great file manager app with FTP.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it!!! As a 21 year old I have read my fair share of crappy children's stories, look no further than Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus!! This is the third book in the series and I cannot wait to see what else this amazing author can come up with!!
0062020889|4.0|Triple is one of the thrillers written by Follett before he began the series of \\"big fat books\\". I enjoyed all of the the previous tales, I thought,  and then moved to the current series which are five star and reviewed on their respective pages. I thought I had read all of this author's books, but somehow I missed Triple so when I found it, I couldn't wait to read it. Follett is one of the best and most amazing writers of the century. Triple follows the breath taking saga of three men trying to get the material  to build an atomic bomb for three different nations. If they are successful. the world as we know it may cease to exist. Follett unfolds the story so we are on the edge of our chairs and flipping pages wildly to keep up with the action. I will not reveal the ending, but you must read this one and see for yourself. Highly recommended.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Love this album. They are a great band. Have some great songs. Will be getting more albums in the future.
1616614609|3.0|The Netrunner card game has been reprinted by FFG and called Android: Netrunner.  I ordered one immediately since I've waited a long time for this game to breathe new life.<br />However this has fallen a bit short of expectation.  The good part is the game mechanics are almost identical to the original and there are some old favorites in runner and corp cards.<br />The bad is that the artwork is in most cases not as cool as the original cards.  Granted you can't improve much on corp cards like homewrecker or liche, but the new set could still benefit from more imagination.  And if they couldn't then include some original art or recommission the old concepts with a new angle.<br />The second point is the card stock itself is somewhat weak and flimsy, definitely not as durable as the original netrunner cards which implies mandatory sleeves.  But as CCG players we prefer to choose whether to use sleeves or not;  And even in the case we do the card itself needs some strength to it if it is to fill out a sleeve correctly.  Also the cards themselves are matte and not gloss protected, exacerbating the 'cheap' feel of the product.<br />A third thought is the symbol for 'bits' looks like an action and vice versa.  I will inevitably become comfortable with it but it's an observation to note.<br />Lastly the counters are all cardboard, which is fine and I knew what to expect on that however for the price at least glass 'bit' counters could be included; Yet this would have been along the lines of stronger card stock.  The box the set itself comes in seems to be a waste of space.  I can only guess that it is to preempt the inclusion of expansions in a centralized container if and when the game grows in time.<br />I personally would have paid 25% more for the product if it would correlate to a higher quality when finished.  Still going to play the game of course, but in holding the original Netrunner in such high regard I expected a better realization.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|I wish I could write a good review of this album.  I can't imagine how any fan of Kiss could like this.<br /><br />I have been a Kiss fan since the early 80s and still am today, but I can't bring myself to say anything good about this.  Please Kiss, retire or grow up and take off the makeup and make new music.<br /><br />To me there are 3 eras of Kiss.  There is the \\"Kiss - Unmasked\\" era.  There is the \\"Creatures of the Night - Revenge\\" era.  There is the post revenge dung eating crap era.  The first 2 eras I truly love even to this day.  The last era, I just wish would end.  Everything Kiss has put out since Revenge has been plodding, monotonous, uninspired garbage.  I can't think of a single song that I have liked by them after 1992.<br /><br />When Kiss first got back together with Ace and Peter and put the make-up on for the reunion tour it was awesome.  It was a chance for many long time Kiss fans who had never seen the original line-up, to see them.  I got to see that tour and it was awesome.  I had seen Kiss a couple of times in the 80s with Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick and they were incredible.  I wish they had done the tour with Ace and Peter and then retired the makeup again.  They should have brought back Bruce and continued on.  Ace should have gone back immediately to his Frehley's Comet stuff which was all much better than anything Kiss has done in the last 20 years.  Before the reunion, Kiss had shown signs of growth beyond just songs about doing 16 year olds and rocking forever.  They had finally started becoming a band again that had input from all members.  Then Eric died.  They replace Eric with another Eric, and he is a great drummer too, but the reunion ended all that and now they just want to live in the past.  Unfortunately it's just embarrassing to hear 60 year old men singing songs like the one's on this wretched smoking pile of an album.<br /><br />It's obvious that Kiss desperately needs some outside song writing talent.  Most of the best songs they have had over the years were written or at least co-written by others.  Boy could they use that now.  Go find Desmond Child again.  Beg Vinnie Vincent to come back.  I'm sure he's not too busy.<br /><br />I will always love Kiss, but not nearly as much as I miss them.  I fear they are gone for good.

1848507836|5.0|This is an incredible book.  It speaks about life, our journeys, the unrealistic goals and pressures we put upon ourselves.  It makes you think about how to approach life from a place of love.  To live without letting yourself be immersed in drama.  And the wonderful bliss of what awaits us on our next journey from this earthly life.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I love this game. haters need to quit hatin. there is nothing wrong with this game. that's all I have to say.
0345803507|2.0|How about a thesaurus if not an editor? \\"Bodywash\\" \\"Smirk\\" \\"Hiss\\" \\"Hmmmm\\" \\"Stop biting your lip\\" \\"No, you hang up.\\" The writing is simply ghastly. and hilariously repetitive--even the so-called steamy sex scenes.  Miss E.L. James may have \\"dreamed of writing stories that readers would fall in love with\\" but as most writers who DO write stories readers DO fall in love with know, taking a creative writing course on plot, semantics, grammar, and other things might help you out. And it's so obvious this isn't an American writer (or perhaps an American-based writer) writing this--so many of the phrases are not what a young American couple would say.<br /><br />But you know what? I place equal blame in Vintage, the publisher. Who would let this mess of a manuscript get through? Are publishers that hard up for books?<br /><br />Entertainment Weekly (a well-knowns entity for its credible and pithy editorial prowess) says, \\"In a class by itself.\\"<br /><br />Indeed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I enjoyed it very much. Can‘t wait for the second book. worth it to own and to gift to book worms.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put the book down and only wished it was longer because it was such a good read.  I would definitely say that if you liked 50 Shades of Gray this is the put for you.  I cannot wait until book three comes out.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|All I can think about is when the next installment in the Gideon ans Eva saga will be released. I read the book in a day, frantic to have the main conflict of the book to be resolved.

Great! Story and Great! Writing.

B0068FYZZW|4.0|A lot of previous reviews have almost unanimously cited how the previous video and DVD releases, with the exception of the High School Reunion Edition, butchered the original motion picture soundtrack.  Original songs were either replaced with other songs or eliminated, altogether.<br /><br />Well, good news.  The newest Blu-ray release restores the original music, featured in the theatrical release. Additionally, the Universal 100th Anniversary Blu-ray includes DVD and digital copies.  Decent picture and sound, too (certainly better than previous releases).  My only, minor complaint are the extras.  Hence, the four, instead of five star rating.  The interviews are okay (I personally could've used less of Diablo Cody).  No theatrical trailers or ads, no making-of documentaries, no commentaries and no archival interviews with John Hughes.  But otherwise, this classic teen dramedy still holds-up.  Enjoy!!!

I hate all the stupid \\"reality\\" garbage  and demented hate filled contests that pass for entertainment now and sadly, have pretty nearly taken over every single network that exists.  I hope the CW keeps Arrow in their lineup.<br /><br />Up date:  Ok, every episode I think there is no way Arrow can get better than 5 stars-it does.  Ok, Amazon-you need to add  more stars because this show deserves them.

B006VKKAWQ|5.0|First off, I appreciate the reviewers who have taken the time to go into some detail on the merits of this release, especially those who pointed out the problem with the Beethoven duplication and the missing bars in that Rossini overture (the Beethoven duplication has been addressed by BMG in this set. The missing bars in the Rossini have not).<br /><br />I was one of those who was fortunate enough to order this set through amazon when someone in product pricing took leave of their senses and marked the set down pre-release to $75, which works out to about 91¢ per CD. Considering the fact that this set cost $1200 or so back in 1992 (a price that was way above my pay grade at the time...which happened to be earned working for BMG in NYC. I couldn't afford this set back then even with my sizable employee discount!) and that one can get it for around $100 in its new format, well, all I can say is, let's hear it for living long enough for good things to happen!<br /><br />This set is a marvel. It is, in fact, even better than the 1992 release, because it includes a lot of discs that have been remastered since then and to much better effect. I am constantly amazed at just how good RCA's mono sound was back then. It is actually very close to stereo in some respects. The dynamic range is surprisingly wide for mono, especially if you compare RCA's sound to the mono sound other labels were putting out at the time.<br /><br />Above and beyond the sound, I am always amazed at how GREAT Toscanini was as a conductor. I spend most of my listening time with stereo and digital recordings. That's just the way it is with my collection. I'm not the kind of person who is such a Toscanini fan that I feel the urge to pull his recordings down every few weeks or even months. Fact is that I might go a year or so without feeling the urge to light up a side of Toscanini. But when that urge does hit, the payoff is always top-drawer.<br /><br />Even after 50 years of listening to Toscanini recordings, I am constantly amazed and re-amazed at the sheer musicality of his approach. I am astounded by the clarity of the proceedings. I am stunned at how \\"RIGHT\\" his recordings sound when set against those made by just about every other conductor of the past 100 years. And that assessment applies as much to the way Toscanini approached what we now call \\"light classics\\" as it does to the \\"heavy classics\\" like the Beethoven and Brahms symphonies included in this set. To Toscanini, it is all MUSIC, and music to be taken on its own terms and treated with respect and conviction. Simply put, Toscanini treats every piece of music he conducts as if it were the most-important piece of music ever composed. And in the moment, he somehow convinces you, the listener, that it IS the most-important piece ever written. Incredible. Magical.<br /><br />With Toscanini, there is always a detail revealed that others missed. With Toscanini, the listener seems to hear new details emerging from recordings that they THOUGHT they knew like the back of their hand. And it happens almost every time one listens to a particular recording, even if it's the 100th time one has heard that recording.<br /><br />I can't explain why this is, but it just is.<br /><br />Get this set NOW, before this latest RCA-sourced complete set disappears from the market, as it surely will. I would suggest this set be added to the wish list of every music lover out there. For less than the cost of a single shopping trip to the local grocery, you will be in musical heaven for years to come.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.ordings, I am constantly amazed and re-amazed at the sheer musicality of his approach.

Simply put, Toscanini treats every piece of music he conducts as if it were the most-important piece of music ever composed. And in the moment, he somehow convinces you, the listener, that it IS the most-important piece ever written. Incredible. Magical.<br /><br />With Toscanini, there is always a detail revealed that others missed. With Toscanini, the listener seems to hear new details emerging from recordings that they THOUGHT they knew like the back of their hand. And it happens almost every time one listens to a particular recording, even if it's the 100th time one has heard that recording.<br /><br />I can't explain why this is, but it just is.<br /><br />Get this set NOW, before this latest RCA-sourced complete set disappears from the market, as it surely will. I would suggest this set be added to the wish list of every music lover out there. For less than the cost of a single shopping trip to the local grocery, you will be in musical heaven for years to come.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I would recomend this to anyone who has read the other books in this series, otherwise the book would make no sence what so-ever. Otherwise this is a amazing book, I can`t wait for the next one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a story, grabs you and keeps  your attention. Put it up there with the Girl with the dragon tattoo.....
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this app just wiped away all my progress again. It actually did this before and I played it again.  my dumb @$$ mistake never again!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Love this author. Really can't wait until the next book! I got hooked immediately and that usually doesn't happen when I read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The sequel to Bared to You was awesome, I am counting down the days until the third book Entwined with You comes out! This series is a must read for those who like the '50 Shades of Grey' type books!!!
B0009P66TK|5.0|Look I find it amusing when people reveiw watches after one week on the wrist.  I got this watch last Christmas and have worn it everyday since then.  It is the most comfortable watch I have every owned due to the \\"lefty\\" design.  The leather band has lasted well - this has been a major issue with other watches because I live in Australia and daily sweat denegrates most bands.  Yes I will be ordering another in the near future - no doubt about it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a good book. On to book two. I wasn't sure id like it but I'm hooked. Glad it was recommended._
B005C7MVC6|5.0|I had tried out Bon Iver twice before and didn't get it so I passed (granted I only sampled a couple audio samples here so understand that).  Then I threw some Bon Iver into a Pandora station and it was over from there.  I had to buy an album!  It's funny because I kept saying, \\"there's not enough Bon Iver in my Bon Iver station.\\"  I bought \\"For Emma, Forever Ago,\\" and I really liked it.  It's pretty raw and a very solid album.  This album though!  It's incredible--a pure gem of a record!<br /><br />It's definitely far away from Justin's first album, but the artistic integrity and spirit are still deep-seeded in this record (which is very important).  The melody and actual music however is a dream.  It does all the right things that you want it to do.  I've owned this album for a week or so now and I'm still obsessed.  I listen through it more times in a day than I care to admit.<br /><br />If you don't like folk/indie music, I wouldn't recommend this however.  Bon Iver isn't the most accessible music for active listening--for those that don't have a significant taste for the genre.<br /><br />That aside though, incredible record!  I'm a big fan now.
1616960922|5.0|The emperor's soul is probably my second favorite Brandon book. I fully enjoyed the Asian undertones and themes in the book. It doesn't quite top Way of the Kings for my favorite, but definitely a favorite.<br /><br />Set in the same world as Elantris, I enjoyed the expansion on the world he made without having to have any knowledge of Elantris to enjoy this book.<br /><br />Brandon is a definitely master at his craft. This book is a true work of art.<br /><br />Thank you for such an awesome book Brandon!
B001U0HAZM|5.0|Very highly recommended. Marvelous movie from one of the best directors currently working with atmospheric thriller's and horror's.<br />It looks great and sounds great on blu-ray. The special features aren't high in quantity but I can assure you are high in quality. I rare thing indeed.
B003K16P3M|5.0|An excellent story was told within these pages. It is a little slow in some places but the wait is worth it. You will enjoy this tale.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I must say I enjoyed this one way more than the first one.  I wasn't too thrilled about the first book but this second book was totally GREAT!!! I completely enjoyed the book and can't wait for December 31st for the third book. I've already pre ordered the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three books and didn't want them to end.  Everyone needs a Christian gray in their life.  Please write another book.  Best reading I have had since Peyton Place as a young girl.

B000063Y8F|4.0|Looked everywhere for a good garlic press and was impressed when I found the Rosle on Amazon...the item was pricey but I was willing to pay for quality.....the item was shipped quickly...I thought this item was made in the U.S.A. but to my horror found a sticker on the press stating \\"made in china\\"...what a disappointment as I try to support American workers......would not have purchased this product if the seller had divulged country of origin
B002ZB26AO|5.0|One of the best book I have ever read. A crisp concise narrative that weaves in 6 interesting and diverse stories. This book makes you appreciate how fortunate you are and how deeply flawed North Korea is in so many ways. This is not a judgment on its people, these are the ugly facts of a bizarre, corrupt, delusional and soulless regime. A stellar work. I will read this again and recommend highly.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Thought Markmof Athena was great. Love how Riordan continues to keep my middle school students interested in mythology. Especially like the Greek & Roman comparisons
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I'm a big Diana Krall fan, and while \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" is not her standard fare, by any means, it is wonderful. She takes on a more country swing feel, and mixes it with her jazz chops. The outcome is an understated, sensual record that I find irresistable. The photographs are daring, and so is the music. Thank you, Diana, for not playing it safe.
0545265355|5.0|Whereas the Hunger Games trilogy has teenagers as its target audience, I am well past that age & loved the series!  The books are well written & provided a new topic, not the same old tripe rewritten for the hundredth time.  It is not light hearted, but is about what one can accomplish with heart.  A fine read!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the book! i had been waiting for this book for a long time, and was overjoyed when the release date can around. The book was amazing, ( PERCABETH!!!) and i loved how Rick Rordan incorperated all the main characters. I laughed, cried, and jumped up and down. Best one yet. I LOVE PERCY JACKSON!!!! Can't wait for the next one! oh, and MORE PERCABETH AND MORE PAYSON! OH, and i loved all the Leo action. SPEACHLESS! THANKS FOR GIVING US THESE WONDERFUL BOOKS!
1454701250|5.0|I cannot wait to get started using Geninne's techniques on stamp carving! I have always been a huge fan of Rubber stamps of all types. Although never a \\"stamper\\" per say- the idea of using your own inspiration to create stamps that can spice up a package or letter is exciting! I know I will refer to this book many times- not only are the projects fun and interesting, but the photography alone in the entire book is also inspiring! Great job Geninne!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game so much!! I always get sad when I have no more coins to play and I hate waiting long to have enough.
B008645YEE|5.0|I just like the movie and its music, so I bought this cd which really deserves a 4 or 5 stars. Powerful, inspiring and exciting music actually.
B007RI56NY|4.0|I enjoy this album. I especially like \\"50 Ways To Say Goodbye\\". I got it because I like Train, and it was here on Amazon for five dollars! That's a great price for a new album. If you like Train, you won't regret the purchase. :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Super writing, historically acurate, characters believable, excellent story lines following different angles. Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors and seems to be getting better!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love it! I would be playing and realize it was way late and I had to work in the morning. Have already played thru twice. Very awesome faotd.
1594744769|4.0|When I first starting reading this book, I thought \\"oh great another author trying to hard\\". But The story is so much more than you think. Yes, it's a lil far fetched but if you take the time to read it, you will love it.<br />I personally had nightmares from some of the scences in the book. But I'm a chicken.<br />Its a great book and well thought out.
B005S9ELQ2|5.0|I remember when this American Embassy was stormed and the occupants were taken hostage. But this film gives that whole incident immediacy and depth. I walked away with a much greater appreciation for what went down.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. The American embassy in Tehran is stormed. Hostages are taken. Six manage to escape and hole up in the home of the Canadian ambassador. An intelligence operative, Ben Affleck, concocts a plan to mock up a team to scout locations for a fictitious science fiction movie to be shot there. The team will consist of the six escapees and the cover will help get them out of the country. A tough road to be sure.<br /><br />It is difficult to convey how good this movie is. It hits the ground running with the siege on the embassy. You get a real sense of the fervor building up on the outside and the panic that ensues on the inside. Bodies running back and forth. The shredding of documents and destroying of electronic files. It's out and out mayhem. Then there's the concocting and honing of the plan itself. The people are brought in. The approvals are made and the pieces are all brought together. The doubts build as they are laid out with just about everyone including some of those they are trying to save. But at a given point they cross the Rubicon and it's full steam ahead. Things now get really tense because either it will work or it won't and everyone dies. What's cool about it is, like \\"Apollo 13,\\" the viewer knows how it will turn out but it doesn't lessen the fear and tension. I was on the edge of my seat. Now my guess is the script was tweeked for the added tension. I doubt the original incident came down to the razor's edge shown in the film, but it made for great cinema.<br /><br />Great attention was paid to the period. The clothing and hair styles were spot on. The movie was interlaced with actual news footage from the main hostage incident to give it a real sense of authenticity. All the actors handled their roles well. It'salways a hoot to see John Goodman and he doesn't disappoint here. Alan Arkin is his usual good self, but everyone, even the secondary characters did a sweet job. They also went to great lengths to make most of the main characters involved look like the originals. Ben Affleck is now 3 for 3 on his feature film directing. He shows a deft hand here. I'm guessing this would hold up well under repeat viewings. For what it is I'd have to say this is as good as it gets.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This one will pull at your heart strings ....especially if you're a parent.  Read this book in three days on vacation...couldn't put it down ....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game for free! Keeps me entertained.  My kids like it too. Good game for in the car.  Keeps changing with each level.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a great on the go weather app. Sometimes it is not accurate though. This is the only professional looking app for the app store.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game has good graphics and I like the variety of tile sets. the storyline mode is fairly entertaining. I also like the variety of layouts.
B007QXU0ZO|4.0|I only like one song from the album and I listen to it non stop. I prefer there old album though.
B008742O32|3.0|After purchasing two new Samsung Galaxy S3's, I discovered that they would not connect to either of my MACs running OSX 10.8 ( Mountain Lion) using a USB cable, even after downloading 'Android File Transfer' and setting the phone to Camera (PTP) mode as instructed. Nor could I send a photo I took to either MAC using Blutooth.<br /><br />I will not go into the complexities and such of either of these issues here.<br />Suffice it to say I spent hours on forums looking for 'EASY' solutions to the simple task of sending a photo to one of my MAC computers running Mountain Lion. It was on a forum I found the solution.<br /><br />To the rescue [[ASIN:B008742O32 AirDroid]].<br /><br />Download and install AirDroid to your Android / WiFi enabled device.<br />Launch AirDroid on your phone.<br />Using your home's wireless router and computer that are on the same WiFi network as your phone,  goto the URL shown on your device and you will be presented with a very polished looking webpage of simple instructions on how to connect your Android device and computer, either by scanning the QR code on your computer screen with your device and the built in QR scanner of AirDroid, or by entering the alphanumeric code shown on your phone.<br /><br />The resulting page has a plethora of icons for applets that allow you to view and edit your contacts, play the music installed on your phone using the computer, (Sounds as good as iTunes), see your message threads and send texts using your computer through your phone, stream videos to your computer, but most importantly to me, download my photos from my phone to my computer.<br /><br />Even if the issues of using my devices and computers via USB are resolved by Google and Apple, I will continue to use AirDroid, because it is that functional... and cool.<br /><br />Simply put, AirDroid is an app to wirelessly connect and use your phone and computer together in lots of fun and efficient ways.<br /><br />Three stars because I could not get it towork with Firefox, only Safari and Chrome so far, and because the Help button on the app on the device screen produces a '404 Page not found error'...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Took some twist I wasn't expecting. Hope the 3rd one does the same thing. Alot like 50 Shades, but very differant.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As a long-standing fan of the Percy Jackson series, I can say that the Mark of Athena does not disappoint as a continuation of the series. It contains the same humor, action, suspense, and mythical education that made its predecessors so memorable. It picks up nicely from where the previous book left, off, and its own ending is a great cliff-hanger (literally!). I greatly enjoyed reading this book, and I eagerly await the sequel, the House of Hades, next year. The only complaint I have is that the digital copies of this book were made poorly, thus interrupting my reading halfway through the story. I was eventually able to finish the book via the Cloud Reader, but I was still irritated by the glitches. That does not affect the quality of the story, however.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Robert Pattinson shows he is very talented outside of the twilight series! The cast was very strong and he made it even better! A very good movie to watch.
B0080XN3C6|5.0|I just have to say I had the pleasure of seeing her in Salt Lake City at one of the better, smaller venues here. I was front row, center stage and if I had to guess by her performance value alone, that will be the last time I will ever get tickets to watch her from 3 feet away. This girl will eventually be a large venue sell out act. As stated in previous reviews, she needs better production people, but other than that, she is the next Adele, but with the added bonus of insane stage presence.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I love this collection! Really beautiful pieces!  Takes me right back to the first day I fell in love with Barbra's voice!  I hope she continues to release more of these gems!!! Thanks, Barbra!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|3rd volume a big disappointment. Seems like she had some ideas left over and simply crammed them into this volume.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The writing and inventive use of Greek and Roman Mythology into the over all story [[ASIN:1423140605 The Mark of Athena (Heroes of Olympus, Book 3)]]was as much of a joy as the previous installment of the series was.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|really enjoyed the different take on this fairy tale.  watched this on my kindlefire HD and was really surprised how great the sound was as well as the streaming of the movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|I just love this app you get to not only see the word you get to hear it. love the word of the day..
B0087JTAKW|4.0|great book, loved it. only problem could've been alot longer. make you think of the time you have wasted on things.
0345803485|3.0|If ever there was a book that was completely over-hyped, I think this would be it. I know that it was originally fanfiction, but that doesn't excuse how lackluster this book actually is. In fact, since it was once fanfiction, I would have expected something a bit better. Many fanfic writers these days can weave more compelling tales than some of the best-selling authors in the world.<br /><br />The phraseology was completely wrong for a book that was set in the United States. There were so many times when I would have to remind myself that the reason that so many lines sounded like they were plucked off the BBC was that the author was English. Even after reminding myself of that, I still wondered why James couldn't seem to figure out how to Americanize her language choice. (Or how to put the characters in England, which might have worked even better.) I've read books and fanfic by Brits who were able to better grasp the American vernacular than Ms. James did. That she didn't seem to even try shows quite a bit of laziness on her part.<br /><br />I get that James wanted to instill a sense of kink into her stories, and that's why she chose to use her own brand of BDSM in the book. The bad thing is that she got it all wrong. Most people in the BDSM community are not damaged. Sure, there are some who are, but the idea that people get into BDSM because they had a bad childhood or that they have to do it to keep from becoming a \\"crack-whore\\" is part of a very old myth about the community held by people who simply refused to learn more about it and wanted to categorize all of those within it as being diseased. Another thing is that BDSM actions are not about abusing the partner. When it comes right down to it, this book is about an abusive relationship. It is not about a Dominant-Submissive relationship. It is about abuse. Now, if James had wanted to write a story about an abusive relationship, I wish that she would have just been upfront about that. It worries me that her characterization of the BDSM community in such a way will inspire some people to attempt to recreate the relationship of Christian and Anastasia and will get people hurt.<br /><br />In terms of writing technique and style, it really isn't very good. Yes, I was intrigued by the dramatic ups and downs of the characters and the relationships. To be honest, the draw of watching the ups and downs was kind of like watching NASCAR for the crashes. You just want to see the destruction of something because otherwise it feels like you've been suckered into watching things go in circles for hours on end, which isn't very fun. I know that the book used Twilight for its basic outline and the characters of that series were basically redone to fit this new story. As a person who enjoyed that series, it was very apparent what parts of that story were lifted to create this new universe. Honestly, it felt like when a kid writes a book report, but instead of summarizing and coming up with their own ideas about what they have read, they choose to plagiarize instead. Twilight wasn't very good literature and to hijack it and place it in another story was not only ethically disgusting, it was also a key part of what made this story badly written. Maybe if James had taken a little more time to craft a more original story, it would not have felt like such a waste of time. I'm just glad I didn't waste money on it.<br /><br />If James plans on writing more stories in the future, I hope she learns how to write them without stealing a story from someone else, using the wrong dialect, and writing what could be seen as an offensive stereotyping of an entire subculture of people. Maybe, if she chooses to write other books, she will learn how to use something many of us call an imagination. Maybe she will also utilize the internet to do some research. It's amazing what she could have learned by just looking for appropriate sources. Basically, I hope she learns how to actually write a decent story someday.omeday.
0062086529|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite story.  After her repeatedly checking this book out of the library, I thought I'd better buy it.  She loves the size and I love that it's a hard cover.  It's definiely something she'll hang on to for years to come.  The book was shipped immediately which I really appreciated.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Anyone who was read any book in the percy jackson series has fallen in love with the climactic battle scenes and playful humor of its characters along with its spot on take of stories form Greek and Roman mythology. This does not disappoint. I've been waiting months for it to come out and now that its finally here I can't put it down. People ask all the time why i burst out laughing at points when I'm reading it. Rick Riordan has got the perfect mix for an amazing book. A+ or guess the greeks would say Alpha.
B0098VXE50|5.0|A different way of telling Snow White.  The dwarfs were excellent.  I enjoyed the entire theme.  My wife only saw the first part and asked me the next day \\"Were there dwarfs? Was there a poison apple?\\"  I told her the story was the same but also different.  It was a very good movie.

B009329ZF2|1.0|The special effects were pretty good, but you had to suspend reality more than I can even do.  Having live ammo on the Mighty MO was almost more than I could bare, but when they dropped the anchor and put her in a power slide I had to let fly some profanities and leave the room.  I wish I had seen this movie before I wasted my money on buying it.

0446519456|5.0|My husband died 2 1/2 years ago. It devastated me - I really didn't think I would see him again.  This book helped me so much.  My husband and I were true soulmates and this book has helped me believe that it is possible that I will see him.  It's as if it were written for me and many others out there who have lost someone they love. Thank you.

1476712042|5.0|This is the kind of book that keeps you reading until the wee hours of the night because you can't put it down, even though you know the next morning you'll be falling asleep at your desk because you stayed up to late reading it!  It's worth the late nights!  This is the kind of book you can't wait to tell your girlfriends about!  Looking forward to reading walking disaster!  Thank you Jamie for sharing this story with us!

B00454U1NS|5.0|This is a great collection of her work so far.  She is a great artist with great style.  Pick it up if want all the good P!nk in one CD :)
1439153663|5.0|It's always a tough choice to pick a book for a book club. We, of course, want it to be a good read, but want to try more than just the bestsellers. This was a great choice as we had many things to discuss: writing style, topic, specific scenes, frustrations, etc. We are all avid readers, but most of the 11 of us took less than a week to read it. It's an easy read in that it's easy to follow and comprehend, but there is tough subject matter. The author did a great job of implying things that were too gruesome for details, but gave enough that we were appalled and upset by what was happening. A great read! HIGHLY recommended.
1619491486|4.0|Book was delivered in a timely manner.  The book was in good shape for its age. Lady Chatterley's Lover was an extremely difficult book to get into as the print is small.
B00846REIS|4.0|I hate to say it ......but if you loved the fifty shades of grey trilogy you\\"ll love this book. Great intense Love Story that will definitely keep you wanting more Enjoy !!!

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Book 2 continues the love story.  More indepth characters development than other popular reads of this genre. Much emotional interaction, sense of caring and compassion among auxiliary characters.<br />Looking forward to book three.  Fun quick read.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was very disappointed in this item, after my I-phone supposedely got water damage even though it was in an otter box Apple told me I had to have this case because of it being 100% water proof. Well luckily I found it on Amazon at such a good price because I hated it, it's very hard to hear your caller and you sound under water to them. I returned it because of this and the left side buttons couldn't be used in the case, I'm greatful amazons return was quick and I was rembursed fast.
0393334988|5.0|Imagine five members of the British military in a World War II Japanese prison camp.  On a single night each suffers a share of nine hundred blows from an ax handle, blackening their skin, breaking bones, detaching ribs.  The next day, they are left all day in an unshaded yard in the heat of a jungle sun.<br /><br />In The Railway Man, one of those POWs, Eric Lomax, unseals his pain with words cracking across the pages like ax handles snapping.  The brutal words stop you cold, the writing spare yet vivid.  You are told forthrightly how it was.  And it was beyond awful.<br /><br />These captured men were made to work on the Burma to Siam railway. Among their imprisoned number, they assembled a radio receiver and from a variety of sources, drew a map of the train route to help them make sense of what news their radio brought them.  They were discovered, charged with sabotage and subversion along with a list of additional offenses grouped under the overall charge of \\"being a bad influence.\\" For such things the men were strapped to a bench with a hose run down their throats pouring water into them until their stomachs swelled.  They were stuffed into cells far too small for them, men in crates.  Lomax is only able to eat with an eighteen inch spoon attached to the splint of one of his broken arms.  Fear is a relentless, maddening companion.  Lomax writes: \\"It is a strange feeling, being sentenced to death in your early twenties.\\"<br /><br />But death would hold back and life would be difficult, taking Lomax past his ninety-third birthday, years filled with pain, nightmares, withdrawal and hatred of the Japanese.  During his war time captivity he spent many days under interrogation and, despite the beatings and degradation, the person he came to hate more than anyone else was the Japanese interpreter who put the questions to him in English.  In the ending sections of the book, in a collision of circumstances nearly beyond belief, Lomax and the interpreter meet again fourdecades later and Lomax forgives him.  One has to marvel.  But one also wonders, regardless of what he says, if such forgiveness can ever be complete.<br /><br />This a book without theater.  It is, instead, a steely reporting of what happened fifty years after it did.  It tells a story of brutal captors in a position to maim, degrade and kill the imprisoned, the unarmed and the starved. It is little wonder that it took half a century to free the author's mind so that he could tell these things.  Even so, at least in the beginning, there is also beauty in the book.  The first two chapters on the power and magnificence of steam locomotives are, alone, worth the book's purchase price.<br /><br />The Railway Man was published in 1995. I had never heard of it until reading Eric Lomax's obiturary. He died October 8, 2012.  Nine days later I had already purchased and finished reading his book.  Lomax at one point says the deprivations of captivity made him temporarily forget how to read.  Thankfully, he never forgot how to write.  And in this book, he did it brilliantly.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|One of the better match-three games out there. It is fun and addicting. The graphics are decent and there are a few twists to the typical match-three's, such as that the playing field isn't square, which can make things a little tricky. Plus, this is only the second game where you are actually rewarded with more than just points for getting match 4's and 5's, as it helps build up your weapon to unleash mayhem on the board. This little power has actually ended up winning the round quite often if you time it just right. It does seem to also go for the squares you would want it to. Another twist is that to achieve objects you have to push them down to the bottom of the field (which isn't always squared, remember). That can get a little tricky sometimes. So I did like the challenge that came from this as you really have to think on your feet quite often.<br /><br />I really like this game. I would question if five dollars is a bit steep for this game, but if this were a demo I would consider buying the entire thing for five bucks. I got lucky and nabbed this when it was the free app for the day! The only down side is that sometimes it has you doing tasks that don't really serve a purpose and that you can't get wrong. I guess it adds to the story of the game, but I would rather just just left it out.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|All I wanted to do was rate this movie, but apparently you can't. I gave it five stars, but I have no interest in elaborating on that other than to say that Pirate Steve's performance was great as usual.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I've read them all and this one is the best of the lot.<br />Thrilling, great humor, and Nesbo paints some amazing scenes with his words.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a great Book.  I really love the way the author writes.  My only issue with the book is that if you are not British you might have a hard time understanding some of the words she uses.  Other than that the writing and vocabulary is awesome!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is fast becoming a favorite of mine...very addicting. I lobe how easy it is to use and the fact you can pin to facebook is great
B008G33PMI|5.0|I loved it, Tarja can do no wrong in my eyes haha :D the setlist is fantastic, I loved that she sang Nemo I only wish they would have removed some of the screams of the fans but overall it's amazing :)
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I simply love this kind of book. It has a touch of what you see in some of Gaiman's books, but with its own peculiar style and a delicious and heroic plot. It is well writen, interesting, thrilling and fantastic, and since its very beggining, it glues your eyes to the pages, looking for a little bit more...<br /><br />I've read it in a day, just sat and read right through it and the only bad thing I have to say about it is that I would very much love to read a second, perhaps even a third sequel.
B007KQXB2G|3.0|The introduction to Season 5, \\"Special Feature: How to Succeed in Business Draper Style\\", told me everything I already knew about anything anyway. It's sort of explaining how Santa Claus works to a thirty-seven year old.<br /><br />To be patronized by elementary commentary made me want to get all Don Draper on their...<br /><br />\\"Bonus-size\\" is no bonus if you're taking out the substance in order to add artificial flavor.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I have used quite a few other Apple products (iMac, keyboard, mouse, iPad) and they all were very high quality and extremely well constructed. This camera connection kit was the first Apple product that I have encountered that is really junky. Both pieces combined barely weigh anything at all, which hints at the cheapness of the construction and doesn't instill much confidence in their durability.<br /><br />For the SD card holder specifically:<br /><br />The opening where the SD card is inserted is about .5mm too narrow at first; you have to actually force the card in the first time, until a bit of the opening is scratched away; then the card will enter a little more smoothly thereafter. This is sort of scary to do with a card that contains precious photos, though, and definitely shouldn't happen on an official Apple product. Second, I expected a nice mechanism (like you find on all cameras) where you push in the card, then push it in again when you want to remove it, and it will pop up. Nope - you just force the card in until it won't go any further, then yank it out when you are done.<br /><br />For the USB adapter specifically:<br /><br />This is fine, but it's very finicky and sometimes recognizes my camera, sometimes doesn't, in which case I have to disconnect and reconnect a few times. You could say this is the iPad's fault, not the adapters, but they work in unison (or at least they should.) (This also happens with the card reader adapter, but not as often it doesn't seem.)<br /><br />Finally, the way these two pieces attach to the iPad is very precarious. You have this long, thin accessory stuck in the iPad, and one little bump could break/bend the connection adapter or the iPad's connection port itself. It would be nice if there were some sort of little extensions on the connecter that hugged the bottom of the iPad and gave the connection some stability/strength. As it is, I'd only use it while the iPad was sitting on a stand, for fear of breaking something while it sits in my lap.<br /><br />That said... it is so convenient to just dump your photos right onto your iPad, instead of using a workaround like Dropbox. And, this is one of the only ways to do it. So, it might be worth dealing with the... eccentricities... of these adapters, to enjoy the convenience of immediate access to your photos.<br /><br />Buyer beware... but you still might want to make the purchase.
B008PZ69T8|2.0|I thought the music choice could have been better.  There was alot of reference to music in the books and the choice on the cd was not as I expected.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|I purchased this album the day it came out, and I haven't stopped listening to it since.  Not as heavy as some of their previous work, but there's nothing on this whole disc that I skip over when I'm listening to it.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|I have no Idea why on earth the title and description of this item state that it is ONLY for the Kindle Fire HD, or why it says specifically that it will NOT fit the original Kindle Fire...it fits it perfectly!<br /><br />I own a Kindle Fire, purchased in November 2011.  Not only does it fit like a glove into this envelope, but on the label of the Timbuk2 sleeve, it actually states that it was MADE for the Kindle Fire, original!  I'm sure it also fits the new Kindle Fire HD, but I have no idea why they would state that the Kindle Fire doesn't fit, when it was designed to fit that model in the first place.<br /><br />Incidentally, it also happens to fit the Kindle keyboard models (as also stated on the packaging).  It's a nice case, nice and simple...perfect if you want to put your Kindle in your purse, bag, or briefcase.  The Velcro is very tough and secure.  This case will not fall apart (at least not in my lifetime!)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|There are plenty of Bejeweled clones out there,but Call of Atlantis is very well made. The jewels glisten, the animation is smooth, and the story is interesting with lush cutscenes. I am definitely enjoying this app!
B009ANAQ4S|2.0|I am disappointed in the album.. Being a long standing Van Morrison fan I feel let down..<br /><br />I thought 3 of the tracks were up to par and the rest did not measure up... It sounded like an attempt to be jazzy and it missed the mark.. When the lyrics and vocal measured up on the 3 tracks I enjoyed it was Van at his best... the rest of the album he turned into someone else and I wanted Van back.. kept replaying the 3 tracks that hit home runs for me..<br /><br />Tracks that made the cut were... tracks 1, 2, and four...<br /><br />The rest are at best mediocre...
1936608898|5.0|I've been reading this over and over, digesting all of the wonderful knowledge, facts and advice of these amazing authors.  This book helps guide you on your journey to changing your entire life; going in the right direction, one choice at a time. It's common sense but Melissa and Dallas make it SO easy to follow along and understand good food choices.  This book is great and it's changing my life every day.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I had high hopes for the new Mumford & Sons album and they didn't disappoint! Every track draws you in and, as a story album, it is very successful. I love how the album takes you on a journey from discovery of new love to the highs and lows of the relationship. I've had the CD looping for days and can't get enough!
B0081G3MWI|5.0|Just what i ask, in the time that they say, i very happy with the item and is exactly like the picture.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This has tons of great ideas, and u could spend hours on this site.  Although it is very adddicting and it is impossible to try everything that u pin.
B005Y4241K|5.0|Bought Adele's live cd (even though I am not a great fan of \\"Live\\" recordings) for my husband and it's still in my CD player...he hasn't had a chance to even listen to it yet.  Great addition to our collection.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|What a fantastic movie. Fun to watch, and taking me back to the years I grew up. Both the theater edition and the Directors cut were great
B00846REIS|4.0|Great book! Started the 2nd and can't wait for the 3rd! If you like 50 shades this book is for you!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game it looks amazing and I think everybody should download it. have a great hunt. try it out!! (:
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Another very good book by Jo Nesbo.<br />Rather complicated.<br />Didn't like the ending.<br />I am concerned that this is the ending of Harry Hole Books.<br />I have read all of them and found all of them great.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|To do this Cd of Jonathan and Charlotte Justice; First have a look at their YouTube Video of their appearance on Britain got Talent.<br />Then you will understand what a Gift this Young Couple has Receive and in return, Given the World a once in a LIfeTime experience. Also it is Hard to Believe that both of them are just 17 years old. This Cd has NO bad tracks and it is not a \\"TWEEN\\" type Songs. The Songs are a treat. So go Get one or Two.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|The political handling of the crises in Europe in the period and the citizens reactions should be mandatory reading for the politicians of today. The related family histories can seem a little too much but in the context they work quite well.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|It might be a fun game if I could progress past level 1. It crashes between rounds &amp; I am forced to reopen the game, after matching the pieces, the game crashes &amp; boots me out. When I come back to the game, my music &amp; noise settings are reset (I silence them) and I have to rematch the pieces, then get booted again.  Please fix this.
030758836X|1.0|Am I supposed to believe that in the 4 months since this book has been available for purchase on Amazon, that almost 3300 people have written a review and that they seem to be mostly positive? I do not believe this for 1 second and Amazon should take a closer look. Scams like this one make it very unfair for authors who have their work reviewed honestly and have built their rating over time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard all sorts of good things about this series of books so I just had to get it and read it. It is AWESOME! I had trouble setting it down and when I reached the end I went immediately and bought the second one. As of now, I am about to start the third book - Can't wait!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love my new Lifeproof case. Its much lighter than the otterbox case I had been using. Very attractivem stylish. Every opening is sealed to prevent water damage. The only negative thing I have to say is, my car charger wouldnt fit because of how the case cover over the charge connection is made. But a I purchased an extender and it works perfectly now. I am very satisfied with this product and the seller was very prompt with shipping
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, it was awesome!  Can't wait till the sequel comes out.  The book contains a great story - mystery, sex, and great characters!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a wonderful 2nd book...love it cant wait for book 3...Didnt see it coming what happened, so excited...I am so happy with my purchase.  I got the book within minutes.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have been using the free version for a while now to see how I like it, and I have to say, this app is great! It will give you any and all information you ever wanted to know about your battery usage (and more) so you'll probably never need another app for this.<br /><br />Some people on here don't understand why you should buy the 'Pro' version when the free version does so much. Let me explain it to you;<br /><br />When I use a free app for a while, and I realize I am-<br /><br />1) Getting a more than average amount of use out of it.<br /><br />2)  I understand the developer a lot of time and effort in to building the app I'm using.<br /><br />3)  The app is of a higher than average quality (better graphics, better User interface, etc.)<br /><br />Then I go ahead and buy the paid version to show my appreciation and to give something back for what I got.<br /><br />There are way too many people these days that are part of this entitlement generation, who think everything should be free. Two bucks for an app of this quality is a small price to pay. So stop with the gimme gimme attitude and step up and pay your way.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|As usual with Reacher books, this one starts with a bang, but with a slower bang than some of the books in this series. It takes a long time to understand how Reacher and the FBI ultimately encounter and neutralize a major threat. Action and marksmanship pay off, propelled by Reacher's character. Before I bought the book I knew it would be good, as Lee Child never fails to lock me into his \\"rollercoster\\" plots. WANTED MAN is among the top three Reacher books.<br />s
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Great album, only time will tell if it has staying power compared to their other albums, but one thing I don't see mentioned much is the fact that the sound quality of this album is garbage unless you're listening to it with basic speakers where it doesn't matter anyway.  I have compared both the physical album and digital version using bose headphones, bose desktop speakers, and in a car with after market speakers with a quality kenwood amp and it all comes out near demo quality.  There is barely any separation between instruments, they're all muddled together.  Combine that with various points of crackling like in the beginning of All for the Love of Rock and Roll and you have a great album that was produced down to mediocrity.  I have no idea how KISS can release a remaster of Destroyer and a brand new album in the same year and the 20 or so year old album sounds superior.<br /><br />I'm giving the album 4 stars because even with the sound quality issues, I like it enough to deal with it, would have been a 5 star album if it had the same treatment as destroyer resurrected (minus the hiccup 5 seconds into flaming youth).<br /><br />My favorite tracks on the album would have to be Hell or Hallelujah, Out of This World, All for the Love of R&R, and Take me Down Below.  To me the 2nd half of the album is superior to the first, so if you've listened to a couple tracks and went \\"meh\\" keep listening.
0525952926|4.0|I really enjoyed Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and Fall of Giants, so couldn't wait until Winter of the World was released.  I have really enjoyed it and the history depicted between its covers. At times I found myself angry with the  political views of the main characters as they lean very much left and I found myself disagreeing with some of their thoughts and actions .  But, I still enjoyed the characters.  The only weakness, I find, is when Follett writes dialogue for women.  He just doesn't get it.  But, overall, this is a great read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|To be honest, I skip through most of the sex stuff.  Whatever.  But the characters, the story, the language, is brilliant.  Love this series, wish there were 10 more to read.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I downloaded this for my three year old grandson.  I think that it is graphic great.  It is certainly entertaining and easy to play.  My grandson pick it up quicker than I did and it kept him busy while we were waiting on an appointment.  I can see why so many people play it.  It is certainly a time absorber.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A classic match three game with a good story line. I would recommend this game to anyone. Thanks dev! More words max 20.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome but the only thing that is annoying is that I find tons of red stone and I mine it and I don't get eneything please fix in next update.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|It was done so well and Danny Divito was great. Divito was great as the Lorax.  His crude humor could bring anybody around.

B007QPFGJW|4.0|Exellent narrative about drug attics in Oslo. Appears to have borrowed from \\"The Wire\\". Unfortunately he appears to have killed off Harry.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|The first song pulls you in and the entire CD keeps you spellbound.  Van Morrison At his best!  I am so glad there was no plan B Because he was truly born to sing!
B002ZG993Q|3.0|`The American' casts George Clooney as Jack, a gunman for hire whose job forces him to live a largely solitary life, but when he is attacked by Swedish hitmen, Jack flees to a small town in Italy, where he takes on the job of building a custom rifle for a mysterious hit-woman, but worlds collide when he finds himself attracted to a local prostitute and the people who are after him haven't given up yet.<br /><br />`The American' is more of a slow-paced suspense thriller and director Anton Corbijn seems to enjoy taking his time to build things up. It's the kind of film that asks for your patience while it develops it's plot threads, but I found the end result really uneven; some parts were just tight with tension, while others just sort of plodded along, so it was really difficult to get into the whole movie. George Clooney was great, though, as Jack and portraying the multiple facets of his character; from a cold, emotionless hitman to a troubled soul looking to escape his `profession' and loneliness. Violante Placido is incredibly beautiful as Jack's love interest, Clara, and adds a lot of strength to the role. Thekla Reuten and Johan Leysen put in good turns as the villains of the piece while Paolo Bonacelli is the old priest who helps Jack find his way.<br /><br />The disc includes deleted scenes, `Journey to Redemption: The Making of The American' and director commentary, all unwatched unfortunately.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|I've read it once so far. Looking forward to another read as I'm sure I've missed a lot of juicy tidbits. Looking forward to the next book.
B0049VQZUA|2.0|I really want to like this, but it's just like '28 Days' mixed with others, but stretched longer.  The most characters aren't really convincing nor some of the logics in behaviors/plots.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This is an amazing piece of marketing, not literary genius.  Referring to her \\"inner goddesss\\" constantly shows the authors lack of vocabulary skills. However she's made enough money to sit on beach somewhere and not care so kudo's  on hitting the multitudes of women needing this kind of fix.  Anyone who is not a virgin could write this!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I love the scenery in the book. Makes me want to hike and find myself. wish there was some maps on the book.
0525953728|4.0|I bought the book more to support the author in his struggle against the DC yahoo's who want to silence him than anything else.  He uses fairly general terms and false names to present a story about a young man from Alaska who becomes a Navy Seal and after ten years of constant combat service ends up on the raid to kill UBL.  He does not gve away any secrets, nor does he go into detail about the methods used by Special Operations Units.  As far as I can tell, the only reason the current administration has it out for this Navy Vet is that he calls BS on the Obama adminsitration two or three times throughout the entire book.  Even then it is nothing that the rest of us Vets have not said thousands of times.  All in all a good read, but don't expect to find any deep secrets.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This group is real good! They turn old classic pieces modern with still a tasteful twist and turn modern pop songs into classic masterpieces. Well worth the money and it's a great listen when you want to relax.
B005L193RO|5.0|Recommended by a friend. Loved it and finished it in 2 days, now re-reading it already. His TedX talk sold me on the book, a lot of it is common sense advice but presented in an engaging, accessible way, with research to support his views. 5 stars.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was excellent. Could not put it down beginning to end.  Cannot wait for the third book to come out
B00943SQCI|3.0|Did not live up to classic series. Could have had a longer glimpse of the original stars, if you blinked, you could have missed them. Should have been less comedy and more drama.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book grabbed me at page one. I'd only bought it because I coworker recommended it. Well I loved it. I enjoyed \\"The Help.\\" This was as good, if not better. I would be surprised if this does not turn into a movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|loved it!!! i finished the first and second book in 3 days. i cant wait to see what happens next!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book is great.  There are however problems with the Kindle text.  I usually use black background with white text while reading in the semi dark to my kids at bed time.  Unfortunately this text does not work in this mode.  The black background comes up in sepia text and the contrast is not great enough to read.  In additions certain chunks of the text have a white background instead of black.  Most annoying.  The have made one update but it has not fixed the problem.  I am  having to use the old white background and black text.
0345803485|1.0|Please don't waste your time on this tripe. I got it for Kindle from the public library out of curiosity, so it was free, and I returned it a few hours later. Boring, ridiculous, poorly written nonsense. But hey, good for the author! Laugh all the way to the bank!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A lovely puzzle game that is relaxing, yet challenging. No fear of getting stuck because you can unlock hints, but I only need that to get a perfect score. Highly recommend. (10/2012)

B005XOPEOU|4.0|If you're a fan of Coldplay you may be pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised with this album.  Say \\"goodbye\\" to slow ballads and deep lyrics and \\"hello\\" to fun, upbeat \\"dance rock\\".  I have been a fan of Coldplay from the beginning and love their new direction with this album, however I am partial to the \\"underground\\" sounds of their first couple albums.  With that said, this album has more than a few really good songs and is well worth the purchase if you like rock music with a pop/dance feel.
1449410243|2.0|A few good cartoons in here, but a lot fewer than I had expected.  Was especially surprised at the small amount of new content.
B007MU85D0|3.0|If  you like the Cranberries...you'll probably love this little gem.  Songs alternate between male and female vocals.  Reminds me a bit of Mumford and Sons and a few other \\"folky\\" type artist.  Nice CD to have in the background as you're doing something else, however the CD never really \\"hit\\" me as I prefer more of an indie rock feel.  Overally, good CD and most liberal listeners will appreciate atleast a few songs off this CD.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Listening to my iTunes music collection with these Sony MDR7506 headphones, it's like my mp3's got a free upgrade to a higher bit rate. My other headphones (Audio-Technica ATHM40FS Precision Studio Headphones) sound somewhat flat, imprecise and washed-out in direct comparison.  The Sony headphones are superior, without question producing clearer and more accurate sound. The Sony's also weigh less on the head, resulting in less neck strain after hours of use, and they fit more comfortably but without sliding off. The Sony's have a coiled cord which is less likely to tangle or trip people.  The Sony headphones work great when plugged directly into my portable MP3 players (Sansa Clip and Coby models), do not require an adapter, and can be worn around the house because the cord is coiled and does not drag or tangle. The Audio-Technica is not practical for use with small portable devices because of the very long cord and need for a bulky adapter.  Over all, the Sony headphones sound better, fit better, work better and are well worth the extra cost as compared with cheaper products.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|The packaging was really great, it perfectly protects the vinyl. Shipment was fast. I have no complaints about it, highly recommended.
006197806X|4.0|I was a huge fan of Delirium, so I ordered Pandemonium pretty much as soon as it was available for preorder.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, other than the knowledge that Lauren Oliver is a fantastic author and I doubted she could let me down.  Of all the YA dystopia out there right now, this is by far my favorite series and this sequel did not let me down.<br /><br />At the end of Delirium, we weren't sure what was happening to Lena, we just knew that she had escaped from the borders of Portland and was wandering around the Wilds, lost and not knowing where she was going.  I was reminded of the whole reason Lena was escaping, to be with Alex, and without Alex there she isn't quite sure what to do.  She's lost without him, without someone to help her navigate and remind her what she's fighting for simply by being out there.<br /><br />Right before I read this one, I reread Delirium, wanting to be sure I remembered it well enough to understand this story.  In the first book, Lena notices how her aunt Carol is going blankly through the same motions day in and day out.  It was interesting to me that, to an extent, she fails to see that the same thing exists in the Wilds, the difference being that in the Wilds people care about it.  They care about their lives and each other, but life is still hard and a struggle every single day.  And our own lives in the real world are like this.  So I had a bit of a moment of clarity, I saw the path by which we as a society could turn into the world that exists in these novels.<br /><br />With that in mind, I started thinking about how this could be possible.  A lot of dystopia seems bad, obviously, but I don't necessarily see how society could get that way.  We don't often see a full origination story, just that there's a crap life that's enforced by the government, and people just go along with it.  But in this series, I can totally see how it would happen.  There doesn't seem to be some inciting incident from the population, no specific reason the government is oppressing the people.  Undoubtedly someone experienced some tragedy they couldn't deal with, and wanted to escape it, so they found a way to do so.  And that could be really appealing to people, because wouldn't it be easier if you could just ignore the fact that a loved one died of cancer, or your dog was hit by a car, or that your job is excessively dull and you feel trapped in it?<br /><br />I am by no means advocating the cure, or the type of life people live in this fictional world.  All I'm saying is that it's thought out enough by the author that it makes complete sense.  I think Lena also sees this at times, because she's so torn up by Alex's death that she seems to want to forget that pain.  This varies, because sometimes she wants to remember him so badly that I can feel it, but I also see that parts of her want to move on.  I've certainly experienced situations where I'm somehow shocked that the rest of the world continued to go on even though mine seemed to be imploding.  But the world does go on, so you have to find a way, just like Lena does.<br /><br />Obviously, because life goes on, Lena must find a way.  The story alternates chapters between what happened directly after she escaped to the Wilds, and what she is doing now.  I enjoyed this chance to see how she has become the person she is now, and I was struck by how dramatically her life has changed in under a year.  There are times when Lena does some dumb things, and I would take those chances to remember just how new all this is to her.  She came from being excited that her cure was coming, to being a part of a resistance against the cure, and not really knowing where she fits in either world.<br /><br />The book ends on a real surprise in more than one way, and leaves me very excited for what is bound to come in the next novel.  Lena has some unresolved things going on in her life, some of which we already knew about and some are brand new coming out of this novel, all are things that I'm excessively curious to see how they pan out.ut of this novel, all are things that I'm excessively curious to see how they pan out.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I got bored with it. you easily run out of coins and you buy more if you want more coins.Its fun then I run out of coins and get really bored<br />You have to remember it is a free game. Theirs always something bad about a free game
B004MPESSY|5.0|There's a lot of spoiler filled reviews out there so I'll try to keep mine spoiler free. The quick summary is, movie is good! Before I get into the movie I'd just like to say a few quick words about the remake debate (feel free to skip it).<br /><br />REMAKE DEBATE<br />I'm super happy they remade this because I didn't watch the original one and I never will. In my opinion, if a classic movie passes the 20 years old line, I feel not only that it is okay to remake it but that it NEEDS to be remade so that they can be re-discovered by the new generation. No one wants to see a 20+ year old movie (or in this case 30+ year old which is older than me).<br /><br />MOVIE<br />Movie is good, the acting is good (or at least most of it), the story will definitively get your emotions up and maybe even make em argue with each other. Quite honestly, I don't have much bad things to say about this movie. Maybe my only criticism is that the story is fairly straightforward and predictable BUT it will still make you interested in what will happen next.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Interesting insight from a surgeon battling the bigger than God egos of the medical profession and outdated hierarchical professional stratifications.  It could do a better job of analyzing the workplace dynamic and discriminations of all kind that hinder the teamwork in many of our hospitals and elsewhere.  Should be read in conjunction with Malcolm Gladwell book `Outlier' which presents a deeper analysis of some of the root cause of failures and successes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|have only had it to a few days but have already used it several times.  like the size of the numbers can see without my glasses!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I put the book down several times but would pick it up to see how the story would end.  Disappointed with the ending.  Should have followed first thoughts of abandoning the book.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|Best MIKA album yet! Everything on this album is so perfect. I am so happy I purchased this CD! Must buy if you're a MIKA fan!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is just what I was looking for & more helpful than I could've imagined! I have a tough time waking up in the a.m., and have developed bad habits of pressing \\"snooze\\" too often,  OR turning my alarm totally off in my sleep & not realizing it until I wake up late & in a panicky bad mood. Well this handy little app not only keeps me informed on the exact right time but has clever features new to me that help to make sure I don't oversleep or forget to switch it on, etc. It allows you to set multiple alarms &each has its own set of rules that you set & then sleep easier.  Highly recommed if you're a kindle fire user. Probably  great for other devices too-just haven't tried it on anything else.
0880793082|5.0|Este excelente Tarot é a indicado para as pessoas que queiram se familiarizar com os sistemas e estudos relacionados com psicologia filosofia, mitologia e entre outras áreas do conhecimento.<br />É recomendável que, junto a este tarot, seja adquirido o Livro de Thot - Aleister Crowley (The Book of Thoth - Aleister Crowley) e o Tarô: Espelho da Alma - Gerd Ziegler (Tarot: Mirror of the Soul - Gerd Ziegler), para se ter uma base sobre a historia por trás de cada carta e como interpreta-las

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Nothing not to like - OUTSTANDING.<br /><br />I especially like the way it can be calibrated for the particular device in which it's installed.

B008XG1X18|5.0|works great on the fire and my cell phone. I can always get lost in pinterest. so happy there is finally an app.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Perfect! Looks exactly like it did in the photo. Protects and looks great! I would highly recommend this product. 5 stars!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I like the writing style of putting believable fictional characters in an historical setting<br />. This time period was an extremely violent and disturbing one, but people did live through it.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|An interesting read with a great  primary conflict.  Strong character development and good writing.  I thought the last 1/3 wasn't  as strong as the rest, but I would recommend this as a good book.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I initially put this book off because I was turned off by the second book, but this book gave much more drama and action
B009SJ47XA|5.0|This next piece of Ryan Murphy's horror anthology is taking TV to a whole other plane of terrifying. This cast could not have been placed better. I may be jumping the gun a little, but I believe Asylum may end up being even better than the Harmons (if that's even possible).
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it so so much I love the pics and the pins and well everything about it really thank you so so much
0316228532|1.0|Nothing to cry about. No joy, no comedy, no suspense, no love. I wouldn't buy another book by this author without reading glowing reviews first. I don't expect many of those for this novel. Yes, I read and enjoyed all of the H.P. books. Is this really the same author?
B0091REZMW|1.0|The game loads up but then that's it. All the buttons are unresponsive, there is nothing to do after it loads up
B0017SWPXY|4.0|For any person that has every loved a dog and considered that dog a vital family member, this book is definitely for you.  You will laugh and cry as the story unfolds.  If you are a racing enthusiast there are valuable pointers for you.  You will not want to put it down until you have finished.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game! I love the plot, graphics and detective work. I also love how you can not only be a dectective but find clues in the hidden objects sections provided through out the game.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book was as fascinating as Malcolm Gladwell's books. I liked it so much that I sent hard copies to my son and to my niece .<br /><br />  It is a couple of months later now and my niece tells me she loved it.. Her friends are on a waiting list to read it too.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The movie was really good and I enjoy watching it.  Wished it told more back story that the book has, but I will still watch the others as they come to DVD.  For someone who never read the book, they will absolutely love the movie.
0812984412|3.0|Like lots of people, I watched every season of \\"Lost\\" and felt let down by the finale; it turned everything that preceded it into trivial fluff. Despite all those years of watching, I rarely think about the show since then. This book was a similar experience. Not that the ending per se was a cop-out -- it was more a similarity in aftertaste. Mostly, it's quite suspenseful and moves along well; one or two stories even have a sense of humor. But by the time I got close to the end, I felt it was more like candy than something nourishing. After I finished it, I immediately chose a new book in which to immerse myself -- unlike some novels that I savor for one or two days, or even for several.<br /><br />There's no question that Mitchell has narrative talent. Even the central narrative set in the post-\\"Fall\\" Hawai'i held my interest, once I got accustomed to the dialect. All the stories have a theme of some person or group abusing his or its power over the main character, and often over others too. Eventually this aspect of the book kind of hits you over the head, and the targets of Mitchell's indignation are pretty predictable: racists/colonialists, capitalists, sadists and the simply greedy. Still, rooting for the good guys is often part of the fun of a novel, and in several storylines Mitchell doesn't deny us that pleasure. Some other conspicuous connections between stories were more contrived: character T's story reappears in movie form in character S's, A's journal shows up about 80 years later as a published book in character R's, etc.; and there is a recurring birthmark. (It looks like the movie is going to make even more interconnections than in the original novel, thanks to its casting choices and, judging by the trailer, added dialogue that will make the story \\"easier\\" and more obvious -- but at least some of those connections will confuse the narrative, not deepen it.)<br /><br />There were also a few minor details that really broke the spell of some stories. Mitchell's biography says he had lived several years in Japan; nonetheless, he managed to come up with a racist distortion of Shinto religion in his \\"Jacob Zoet\\" novel. In this one too, his quasi-realism is a bit too quasi-. Some Englishmen refer to themselves as \\"Aryans\\" in the 1850s, when it wasn't until the 1860s that this meme had its first use in English. Native-born Californians use terms Britishisms like \\"quay\\" (instead of dock or pier), \\"first-class\\" in reference to a UC Berkeley degree (instead of summa cum laude), and \\"fourth September\\" instead of the other way around. Stacks of shipping containers play a role in a 1945 event, even though they weren't developed until the 1950s. The US Department of Energy is supposed to have existed in the Ford Administration and even during the 1960s, when in fact it was created by Pres. Carter. And a Christian American uses the word \\"dybbuk\\" in his Gold Rush-era journal, even though that yiddishism didn't hit English until the early 20th Century. Is it so tough to consult Wikipedia, the OED and a real American person? Had these stories been overtly \\"alternative history\\" in genre, maybe some of these anachronisms and slips could be excusable, but that doesn't appear to have been Mitchell's game. Sure, these are small details -- but so are most pebbles that find their way into your shoe.<br /><br />While I don't recall any other work that combined all of this one's structural and stylistic tricks into one book before, individually they have indeed all been done, and often in a more engaging way. The nested story/interconnection trick was done a couple of times by John Barth (Chimera; Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor); one could even go back the the turn of the 20th Century with Arthur Schniztler, and maybe earlier, for the linked-story motif. Barth also excelled at mimicking and inventing distinct voices (Sot-Weed Factor, Giles Goat-Boy), as did lots of comparable (Anthony Burgess) and incomparably better (Melville, Joyce) writers. To be fair, Mitchell is emotionally slightly warmer than Barth, even if his technique isn't as dazzling. For literary science fiction, though,  Doris Lessing's interlinked Canopus in Argos series is far more rewarding. It's just as politically-themed as Cloud Atlas, occasionally quite funny, but often subtle and moving enough to bring a tear or two to a reader's eye. And unlike \\"Lost\\" or this novel, Lessing gives you a lot more to think about after the story ends.  In sum: for the most part, fun while it lasts, which may be a good enough reason to read it; but keep your expectations low to moderate. [P.S. ADDED A COUPLE DAYS LATER: After a few more days, I came around to feeling that the author's sloppiness about detail wasn't merely annoying, but a more serious symptom of the book's superficiality: he seemed to have been more concerned about producing something flashy than about craft. Kind of appropriate that's it's been movie-ized by the same folks who brought us \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" with Keanu as savior. So for me, at least, it was a book that I soured on once I was out of its immediate spell.]
B0084B5TK8|3.0|There is a stretch of the PCH just South of Point Mugu and a bit North of Malibu, that has been in so many car commercials that you can't help but have a sense of deja vu when you drive it even if you've never been there.  That is how this book went for me.  I felt like I was reading a very, very, very long winded treatment for every movie from \\"Nosferatu\\" to \\"Love Bites\\".  Unless you are a glutton for this type of work or a die hard vampire-phile, give it a pass.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|I went into this really wanting to love it, my wife and I just had our first child in January so I thought this might be something funny we can relate too. Think again! All those funny parts in the previews yup that's it hardly anything else made us laugh. The 4 main couples seemed really artificial they didn't have any chemistry and felt like they only cast them for star power. The husbands were the stars really but only a few of their parts were funny, Chris Rock is the stand out but that is a given. The other guys were not all that funny and one they tried to tack on an attraction to another guy in the group? Why not just have a gay couple adopting a baby instead of this that would have made more sense and actually added diversity to the group. The girls were all pretty boring personality wise with the exception of the younger couple (Anna Kendrick's character) not even on the cover. Very strange plot too broken up and no character development. This was a pretty weak attempt from Hollywood to cash in on parenting don't rent or buy this garbage I wish I hadn't.
B000002O1Q|5.0|Love this movie..Love the music!..These films, Eddie & The Cruisers * Eddie & The Cruisers 2(Eddie Lives) Streets Of Fire Were Michael Pare's Best! in my opinion..
B008SOS63S|5.0|This is Joe at his best! The sound and quality is awesome. The \\"special guests\\" are outstanding as well. A GREAT BUY!!!
B0088749CW|4.0|The movie is original and suspenseful.  The plot really throws you for a loop and you'll be trying to figure out who is the good guy even after finishing the movie.<br /><br />It's worth a rental and it's also available on Netflix (as of writing this review.)
0062206281|4.0|There's no doubt Zafon is a clever and talented writer.  Many times throughout the book I would marvel at his original descriptions and ability to turn a phrase.  His language is a pleasure.  However, I was lead to believe that this was a \\"stand alone\\" book that I could appreciate w/o having read any of the other companion books.  This seemed to be the case until the end, at which point I felt that I'd been left out of a private joke. I didn't get it.  After setting up various intriguing questions throughout the book, I was impatiently waiting to see how they were going to be resolved.  And then I was disappointed.  Still, I am curious about his other books, of which there are many, and I plan to seek them out.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|What's not to like in a comic book based action thriller Saturday matinee type flick? Great characters, melodrama, slick action, witty dialogue, heroes, heroines, villains, destruction, glory, redemption, humor!  Don't think; don't ask questions; don't look the McGuffins in the teeth; just enjoy it!

B000002O8D|5.0|I have this record since the day it was originally released. (on vinyl)<br />I decided that I wanted it on cd as well. I remember that when I first<br />heard it in the 80's, I thought the drums were high in the mix especially<br /> the snare. At the same time Gary's guitar was a little low. I still think so.<br />Other than that it is a very good live album and don't forget that there<br />are 5 original members playin' in the band, one of whom is Ed King who<br />plays a big part in recreating the original Skynyrd sound. Another thing is<br />that in that first reunion tour they used the old Peavy Maces amplifiers<br />and that is another thing which contributes to the sound.<br /><br />Angelos Karagiannis<br />Athens, Greece

The results are excellent.<br />I hope that many LP's like this will follow.<br /><br />Angelos Karagiannis<br />Athens, Greece

B004YM6JK0|5.0|I have all six seasons of Supernatural and I totally love it.  The seventh season is just as good as the rest of the season and I am sooo pleased with it.  It was worth every penny and more.  Hoping there will be a season eight to buy someday.

1439175640|4.0|Nice book but wish it had more pictures of the actual baked goods. Haven't baked anything in the book yet.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was skeptical about reading this series and the first book was a little slow for me at first. Once I got to the end of the first book, I was hooked. Fifty Shades Darker, however, is MUCH better than the first. The story line is more intense, the plot thickens and there is more to be interested in beyond their sexual chemistry. Can't wait to start the third...
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I read this book almost non-stop, it was difficult to put down. Like the previous book in the series (Zero Day) it is absolutely captivating, and it's technical details are all authentic, while at the same time beeing delivered in a format suitable for non technical people as well. It paints a scary, but probably accurate picture of the worlds current it security situation. A must read for anyone who owns a computer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a awsome game sometimes has gliches like u cant pick up ur stuff but rarly happens its a great game though
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Incredibly fun and addicting game.  Game play is simple but challenging.  Great artwork and animation.  Highly recommend if you are a fan of games like Angry Birds.  To the last reviewer, it's a jellyfish, not a dog.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|I'd rather pre-order this and save money.  I don't really care about special features and extra items too much, the point is to have the film itself. Those who say it's quick money grab, it's his/her choice. It's going to be more expensive in the future. Besides, Not everyone uses the extra content that comes with their special/collectors edition. It's useless to me. I am sticking with this one.

Thank goodness I never tried the water test or would have most probably messed up me daughters new phone.<br />I made this discovery when I purchased the color I wanted today at Best Buy and compared.<br />If you are smart pay the money and buy where the store stands behind the product. Otherwise it might just cost you more in the long run.<br />Not to mention you have worthless people trying to screw people out of their money by giving them crap and lying to them.<br />Remember what goes around comes around!!!
0385344333|4.0|I picked this book up at the library last night and couldn't stop reading once I began, and couldn't go to sleep until I'd finished.  Lee Child has done it again: crafted a non-stop thriller, with elements of Sherlock Holmes, spy fiction, and his usual wonderful hero* with a spine-tingling climax.  Reacher is in great form.<br /><br />For those who have never read a Reacher book, this is a fine stand-alone and it isn't necessary to have read early ones to \\"get it.\\"  For fans like me, this is another excellent one to stack up next to Child's previous ones.<br /><br />By the way, no hijinks with a plane so this is a perfect book for that airplane trip you're planning.......<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B009SRJAG6|5.0|I have been watching Supernatural since it started. I love this show. I would recommend it too anyone who likes anything about the unknown.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I don't know why this film got panned so much by critics. I read some of the John Carter stories as a child, so I wanted to see the movie, but the poor reviews in the papers and online nearly made me change my mind. I don't regret seeing it in the end. The plot doesn't have any surprises, but the scenery of Mars and the skyships were impressive, and Princess Deja Thoris is quite a beauty!
0385341008|5.0|This is one of the most delightful books I have read in my life, full of courage, hope, inspiration and gentle, sometimes hilarious, humour.<br /><br />What I found interesting is that the German occupiers are not completely demonized here, and although at war, try to be civil and sometimes even accommodating to the villagers.  As such, it is probably more realistic than most books about German occupation, which focus almost exclusively on the horrors perpetrated by the German command and not the common soldier in the trenches, or in this case, low level administration.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and it stayed with me for weeks and weeks after having read it.  I gave my copy to my sister, who gave to to her daughter, who gave it to her friend and on and on it went charming, entertaining and inspiring one after another.<br /><br />Because this is a book you will want to pass on, get the paperback, not the e-version (paperbacks on amazon are usually cheaper now these days anyway, although it didn't start out like that).  Even better, get it used from The Book Depository right on the Isle of Guernsey itself :)  Save a tree.
B008I34YYY|5.0|This was great! Hats off to the directors and writers of the world who still know how to make people laugh and not take themselves too seriously! Space Nazies?? Right there you should start cracking up! This movie has it all! Chicks with big boobs, cheesy story, etc. But surprisingly good special FX and music. I love the space fight at the end where the U.S. finds out that every major country has armed space ships! The U.S. president (who looks disturbing like Sarah Palin which is the point) yells at the U.N. delegates, \\"We said we wouldn't arm our spacecraft you all lied!\\" To which another delegate says, \\"But you armed yours! You lied first!\\" The presidents reply: \\"We are the United States! We always lie!\\" Too funny! Enjoy it for exactly what it is. Mel Brooks would watch this and laugh I'm sure!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|So much fun to play! Graphics are really great, just like in the movie! Does get a little slow at times but usually doesn't last long. I have never paid real money on anything and am almost at level 50. Scrat's mini game is really fun too!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book and would have given it 5 stars if it had a better ending.  Gone Girl is so well written that it draws you in immediately.  You really get to know the characters well.  My book club read it and we all agreed that it was difficult to put down.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is one of the best match 3 games that I have ever played. Great graphics and great game play!!! 5 stars!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Very good set, has all the features that you would expect, the bonus and deleted scenes along with the Whedon voiceover option is a good watch. I'd buy it just to watch The Hulk and Loki :)
B005COO1X6|5.0|Best short story ever! I‘ve never read a short story by SK and I was very pleased. It was super creepy and well written.  Keep up the good work!
0307463745|5.0|A must read for all entrepreneurs. The authors take a simple, straightforward, and sometimes humorous approach to addressing the many challenges that entrepreneurs face. It's an easy read, with many actionable takeaways on every page.
1400049628|1.0|Well, I'm not surprised the majority of the people gave this 4 and 5 star ratings. The majority of Americans are just plain dumb. This book is like the rantings of a prepubescent kid who just saw his first zombie movie, and feels it's his duty to \\"educate\\" the masses.<br />Pretty much like the other 1 star reviewers have said...boring, not funny, not entertaining, not enough detail. I stopped reading when it got to underwater zombie fighting, which of all things, he felt it deserved 10 pages to explain.<br />Bottom line: If you can think for yourself, take an hour and jot down a few ideas of what you would do in a zombie apocalypse (or any other epidemic) and you would have just saved yourself 10 bucks.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This author goes so far out of her way to differentiate herself from Harry Potter that she goes completely and miserably overboard. The words got in the way of the story so much so that I could not even get past page 40. This book was offensive and totally lacking any reason to hang on and persevere.  I returned the book.
1455502758|4.0|A really impressive document. Having spent my entire professional life in  the cancer field  I appreciate reading this book  by a dedicated ateist (like myself). My hope is that we shall soon see a danish translation for a broader audience . The book deserves it, he deserves it . It is recommended to everyone young or old healthy or diseased, Read It !!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was even better than the first!  The author steps it up and keeps you guessing till the end!  I LOVED it and can't wait till the next one comes out!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love this series! Rick Riordan is an amazing author. This book is great for teens and adults as well. A definate must buy.
0307341550|4.0|The only reason i picked up a Gillian Flynn book is because Entertainment Weekly basically told me i would miss out if i didn't. Boy, were they right. I read Gone Girl first and then Dark Places (easily the top 5 books I've ever read.) But Sharp Objects was last on my list and i am glad it was. Although it was my least favorite, it was still a pretty good read. Flynn's character development is obviously not as \\"sharp\\" on her first novel as it is later, her descriptions of smells,  or feelings, or lack of support was riveting. Also, the fact that i was sure who the murderer was from the beginning of the book, and then i was wrong, was another high point. Don't judge a book by its cover, we were always told. that rings true in all of her books, this one especially. have fun reading this one as you will think about it for weeks afterwards. Ms. Flynn, how long until the next novel? not sure how long i cant wait. Brava
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Wether you have seen the original or not, this is the best in \\"high\\" camp. Fun, well acted, great scenery and music. A very pleasant and amusing 90mins to spend. The Burton/Depp team does it again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book of the games was heartbreaking, breathless, unexpected, epic but final.  How will i go on......great trilogy and i find myself wanting Katniss and Peeta to be the safe in their horticultural world.  Great writing!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I woudln't consider the trilogy well written but still a read not easy to put down. Though it is far too detailed in its treatment of sex scenes, the third book in the series hits the mark as far as the modern \\"happy ever after\\" ending i love. Definitely the hearts and flowers Jane Austen inspired love story.
078322611X|5.0|love this movie! i had a problem when I first ordered it lost in transit or something but I never got it after waiting three weeks I informed amazon and they shipped it to me the next day and allowed me to received it in one day without any charges again awesome classic movie!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So I had to wait awhile for the follow up to Bared to you - It was SO worth it.  The saga between Gideon and Eva continues and is even more intense than the first book.  Yes they are two hot messes who somehow find love and a codependent relationship.  But you cannot doubt the true abiding love between them.  This follow-up to Bared to You delves into a lot of the mysteries that were unaddressed but lurking in the background in Bared to You.  I simply could not put this book down and felt like I was riding the emotional roller coaster with them.  Somehow this author makes it work.  As Gideon tells Eva to \\"be patient\\", I have to remind myself to be patient for the next installment.  Ms. Day will surely make it worth the wait.
0786962984|4.0|I remember playing the original Dungeon! board game back at my neighbor Kenny's house.  It served as a great recruiting tool for my elementary school friends to get them into playing Dungeons & Dragons later. Over thirty years later, I played this latest iteration with my five-year-old son.<br /><br />The premise of Dungeon! is the original premise of Dungeons & Dragons: four murder hobos wander into a dungeon, grab as much treasure as they can by killing as many monsters as they can, and then escape back home with it all. The dungeon has a neat order to it, with increasingly difficult levels of monsters (six in total) and correspondingly higher treasure rewards. Some treasure includes magic swords that give a bonus to attack while others allow the player to see what monster lurks in the nearby room.<br /><br />Combat with each monster can lead to acquiring a treasure or, if you are unable to beat a target number with a combined roll of two dice, losing treasure, ground, or even your character's life. But don't worry, like in the tabletop role-playing game, even death isn't permanent.<br /><br />The original Dungeon! game had four classes: elf, hero, superhero, and wizard corresponding to the original Chainmail wargame.  Yes kids, back then we had heroes and superheroes as classes.  The 1980s version I'm more familiar with was retooled to match Basic Dungeons & Dragons: dwarf, elf, paladin, thief, warrior, and wizard. So perhaps it's no surprise that this latest version has cleric, fighter, rogue, and wizard classes.<br /><br />The wizard, a constant through all editions, differs significantly from the rest of the classes in his ability to cast spells: fireball, lightning bolt, and teleport. And that's part of Dungeon!'s brilliance.  You can play correspondingly different levels of play by the character you choose.  My son played the Halfling rogue and I played the human fighter. Because each class has different levels of gold requirements to win the game, each class is encouraged to take more or less risk by venturing into deeper levels of the dungeon.<br /><br />One consistent problem with all versions of Dungeon! is its multitude of pieces.  There's cards for monsters, treasure and spells, cardboard pieces for the classes that don't stand up particularly well, magic sword tokens, lose a turn tokens, and number tokens that I still have no idea what they do. But the most egregious tokens are the \\"cleared\\" graveyard markers.  When monsters are killed the markers are placed in the room, which is fine, until you have 20+ and if you jostle the board the tokens slide all over the board.  It's very easy to lose track of what rooms you cleared as a result.<br /><br />The other problem is that occasionally you're supposed to draw cards randomly from your collection of treasure, but they are clearly marked on one side by level and color.  The only way to actually randomly select which treasure you lose is by closing your eyes.<br /><br />Still, this is a very entertaining game that can be played by players of different levels of skill.  Even a five-year-old.  Who beat me at my own game.s is encouraged to take more or less risk by venturing into deeper levels of the dungeon.<br /><br />One consistent problem with all versions of Dungeon! is its multitude of pieces.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I picked this up when it was free just because so many others raved about it and said it had very minimal permissions.<br /><br />I must say that this game is very worthy of the many positive reviews. I just started playing it and an hour had passed before I realized how much time had passed.<br /><br />The twist by having different shaped boards and also trying to free up game pieces by getting them to the bottom line was brilliant! It adds an unexpected challenge to the game. The music is nice without being annoying, and the facts thrown in throughout the game are quite interesting.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with this game and am now going to actually purchase at least one of their other games. I am very satisfied with this game and it plays smoothly on the Galaxy S3.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|Fortunate we are in Los Angeles that Andr&aacute;s Schiff has honored us with his inimitable performances of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier Books I and II.  The first evening he performed Book I and next week he will open us through Book II. But this luxury is available to all music lovers now that Schiff has recorded this massive work for the second time (the first recording was in 1990 and though many still hold it as the gold standard, it pales in comparison to this new approach that in many ways is a revelation).<br /><br />Schiff declines to use the sustaining pedal and instead focuses his playing on the physical challenges of this massive work, leaving all the keyboard unblured by the erasing contraption. How he manages to make the work flow so naturally from each prelude and fugue - one in each key, major and minor - and still maintain the overall beauty of spirituality over the obvious precision of this technique is simply something that must be heard to believe.<br /><br />Schiff plays every note as Bach wrote it and yet despite this masterful clarity of execution he is able to impose a sweetness of tone and an obvious devotion to the inner spirit of the concept Bach manifests when his works are played with such mastery.  Some pianists tend to treat these Books as epic challenges to master - more marathons than works of art. There is not a moment while hearing Schiff accompanying the listener through this masterpiece that fails to respect and speak to the spirit of Bach's (and music's) genius, transporting us to another holier place.  This CD set, this unqualified phenomenon of creativity and artistry, is not to be missed.  It is brilliant, it is cleansing, and it is an overwhelming spiritual journey.  Grady Harp, October 12
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I like this game..the prices are not real high..I play Bakery Story also and they have gone up on everything..I figure that will probably happen on this game too but for right now it is the better game for your time spent playing. I like that I have neighbors to play along and there are no interruptions by ads. Watch out if you let young children play because it will take real money so child proof your device.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|[ASIN:B007URVZJ6 Building Your Book for Kindle]]<br /><br />This book was helpful in leading me through my first simple book upload.  However, I had a lot of trouble understanding how to get my images (many illustrations) to upload.  E-mailing the KDP 'help' line finally clarified the process for me. I don't think this book made it very clear.  My book has no chapters or Table of Contents, so have no opinion on how that may have worked.  Still ... this book was easier than trying to do it with only online instructions.  (I printed out the PDF file)
B004W4N55C|4.0|Haven't used it much, but I very impressed. No problems etc Like very much<br />I have a HTC EVO 4G
0316228532|5.0|This is definitely an adult book, and discusses many adult themes. Also, it might be beneficial to have a laptop next to you so you can look up some of the British slang that is used by the younger characters.<br /><br />As a person who has a really tough time remembering peoples names, the beginning of the book was a bit of a struggle for me. There are a lot of different people being introduced and sometimes I would be confused as to who was who. So after 30 pages of this, I started writing the names of some of the people and the something about them, and from then on out I was good.<br /><br />I literally could not put this book down. The beginning was slow, but necessary to have an introduction to the many different kinds of people in this seemingly peaceful town. Once the introductory chapters were completed it was beautiful. While the whole book was really good, it was the last 50 pages that made me cry and realize the beauty and sadness of this story.<br /><br />A solid 5 stars. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|A very silly overacted and poor attempt at comedy! I guess it was supposed to poke fun at the traditional anchorman, but it was way off the mark to the point of being stupid.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've owned this watch less than two months, and I'm still figuring it out. Despite printing out the 56-page manual and watching online videos at [...], there are many features I don't understand, find unintuitive, or have been unable to make work (some of my frustrations have been reported in my blog at [...]).    I live in an area where GPS reception is poor, so it often takes quite some time for the watch to find a satellite reliable enough to provide route information. Additionally, it's taken numerous experiments to get the heart rate monitor working consistently.    I bought this particular model specifically because it offered an alternate band for smaller wrists. It actually includes two: one that is too small and one that works but is actually a little longer than ideal. I was concerned that the touch bezel would be cumbersome to use, and in fact I do find it often frustrating when navigating through menus. Surely more practice and more careful reading of the manual will help, but my attempts to customize the training screens have resulted in a big mess so far.    Although the online Activities page does allow users to select Walking as an activity, the watch really is intended primarily for runners, so many of its features (especially the planned workouts) are ones I won't be using. It would also be nice if the heart rate monitor could be used for any activity, even with the GPS turned off, but this is thwarted by the watch going into PowerSave mode. I haven't yet experimented with the AutoPause feature, but I need something of the sort because one of my hobbies is exploring new construction, and I don't want this to be part of my recorded activity (with my previous watch, which was just a stopwatch, I could temporarily stop the watch, then restart when I continued my walk).    On balance, I think this watch is amazing. It appears to be very well made; the battery life is very satisfactory, and I think it would be a great product for any runner; it's just not so suitable for my activity.
B004SIP7PS|5.0|I saw this first in the theatre and thought it was great. i bought it to add to my collection, it's a good movie with great performances from all in the cast.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I started reading I was lost because I had read Bared to you in June but I caught up quickly and it all came back. Enjoyed this as much as the first. Can\\"t wait for the next one!
B003O86FMW|4.0|So far, i love the series.  i only hope the third part lives up to the prom-se of the first two books
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This one tops them all! I read all three books in the trilogy and didn't want to put them down once I started!!
0316228532|1.0|I was soooo disappointed in this book.  I would never have expected the author of the amazing Harry Potter series to write a book like this.  I am a 57 year old grandmother, but am selective about my reading.  This book is definitely R rated and NOT suitable for kids.  I repeat . . . NOT suitable for kids.  I read some and then skimmed the rest. It was vulgar and crass.  There was an abundance of sex and profanity. If this is the type of book the public wants, it's a sad commentary of what we find entertaining.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app really has become a favorite. Being able to select from so many different Bibles, books and plans can make it very personal. And if your Church takes advantage of the \\"Live Event\\" function it can be an added benefit. Live events provides the ability of having prepared sermon notes sent to your email for prayerful study later.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This mystery game is great. I love how challenging it was but you didn't care since the story line was a good one.
B006G2124E|5.0|Great movie. My husband and I enjoyed immensely. It's a poignant story with excellent real life drama. Really brings history to life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I cant stop playing this game. I've never had any problems with this app. I play the game all day long.
B008N4XC2I|5.0|This was well worth the money in my opinion. The vinyl has a much better tone and clarity I didn't get on the FLAC download. There were recorded parts that I didn't hear until I heard it through vinyl.<br /><br />The album, imo, isn't their best, but it has some really good tracks. Not a fan of maybe 2 or 3 tracks, which for me and a MUSE album is rare.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I liked it a little.  Not a page turner like the first one.  It does give some answers for you from the first book, but was not nearly as good as #1
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The best Marvel movie by far no questions asked. This was a no brainer to buy this movie at $19.99 when it first came out on sale. The 3D works perfect for a movie in this genre.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great mix of top stars in this action packed movie. Love the special effects! Had my mouth drop open when those big things came undulating in the air out of the portal opened up in the sky!!!! There were a couple of slow spots in the story line but not enough to detract from the overall plot line. Can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a pretty interesting game that keeps you guessing and keeps you entertained for hours.  Very addictive and creative. Worth checking out!
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|Once Upon A Time is a great show. I started watching it a year ago and was hooked. It is a great show for children and adults.
1401307450|5.0|what an excellent book. Throughout the whole book you are cheering Anthony on and want him to succeed so badly. great read.
0525952926|5.0|Another facinating read!  Follett obviously does in-depth research to give great and accurate insights into the historical events in his books.  I slow down my reading of Follett's books to savor them.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was an unexpected sequel to Bared To You. It was a good book and I would recommend it to my gal pals. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great app. me and my sister love this app we take turns playing against each other. I play till I go to sleep.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The 1st Fifty Book is GREAT!<br />The best of the 3.<br />The next book, 50 shades Darker is good, but a little predictable, and the 3rd, really she could have wrapped it up in 2 books, but good on her she's made a fortune, everyone should read it if only to enhance your sex life. Its toe curling stuff.I Looooooved it. and we all need a Christian at some point in our life, Id like one right now infact....anyone....Lord Gray? NO? O.k. I'll have to read the 1st one again......:)
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you're a Beatles fan, get this. Alternate versions and trippy remixes makes all these songs sound fresh and new. If you're not a fan, get this anyway. It is an excellent composite of their wonderful work. This is a great brain teaser. Try to figure out which lps these passages are from without looking at the notes. Ha. George Martin, you are a genius!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down!!!!  i  can not,wait to     start reading the next book and see what happens next with  them!

B004KNM3HQ|5.0|I've always loved Suede. During the nineties while my friends were all into grunge I was into Britpop, being a younger admiring sister to a brother who was heavily in to the Smiths ,the Stone Roses and Bowie I had no other choice. I loved the glam, the sexually ambiguous undertones and the dark complicated lyrics and music of that genre who, for me, accumulated in one glorious band - Suede. I bought Suede's first album when I was sixteen, from the first few notes and the iconic semi-jebrish lines by flamboyant, cocky, extremely talented and ridiculously sexy lead Brett Anderson I was hooked. Suede's self titled first album hasn't left my stereo ( the 90's IPod) for almost a year. By the time the band's second album was realest I was eagerly waiting to hear what musical masterpiece the duo Anderson-Butler will concoct. Dog Man Star hit me like a speeding train. This album resembled nothing I've heard before. It somehow managed to be both hauntingly beautiful and incredibly sad. I guess the emotional turmoil happening backstage made it what it is. It definitely didn't have the rocky explosive feel of their first album but it had something better - more mature maybe. Anderson's heart wrenching lyrics alongside Butler's brilliant melodies are the common thread between the songs and they leave you in tears. This album is a masterpiece from beginning to end, no song is better than the other (with the exception of \\"asphalt world\\" which should have an adjective invented to describe how good it is) if you want to buy only one suede album (although I cannot understand why) this will be it.  why should you spare the extra money for the deluxe addition? Well, Suede were always very grateful for their fans and treated us with immense respect, they still do so. I always conceder the \\"remastered\\" thing to be a rip-off scam led by music companies to make more money. Such is not the case with the remastered DMS (or any other of suede's albums featured in this format). The package isabundant with goodies making it money well spent. The Album itself features 5 demo tracks, The B-sides C.D is jam-packed with great songs, three of which I conceder to be B&Bs' greatest work; \\"My dark Star\\", \\"the living dead\\" and \\"killing of a flash boy\\". It also has three tracks which did not appear in any official album (yes - I mean sci-fi lullabies) the mediocre \\"stay together\\" ,\\"this world needs a father\\" and \\"we believe in Show Biz\\", it also features Brett singing in French. The DVD is filled with live shows and an interview with Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler years after the debacle that made Bernard leave, it's a treat. For us diehard fans who are eagerly waiting for Suede's reunion and a new album (which, I heard is in the making) this box set is a must as it fills our appetite for some new Suede stuff. For all the rest, simply put, this is a musical gem. It captures a time a place and a state of mind in pop-culture history and it truly is one of the best albums I have ever heard.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|my four year old loves this game. took a minute to figure it out (double click is the key), but once we did it was great, non violent, vaguely educational fun!

B0012NVGHU|3.0|My wife and I discovered \\"Once\\" pretty late, so we saw the Broadway version before we saw the movie (the movie was the original, the stage play is a spin off).  By the time \\"Once\\" got to Broadway, it had been refined and shaped into a wonderfully tight and entertaining work.  The movie shares the same plot and characters and music, but it is a much rougher piece of work.  That being said, the film is sweet and often funny and the music is very good.

B009PNQUXO|1.0|nothing in particular was bad about the app, it seems a bit buggy, but reading the EULA was concerning. It kept referring to THIS SOFTWARE and a company called ALDROID i can find no other information about. uninstalled immediately, use with extreme caution.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Story was suspensful, gripping and emotional. Reacher is a character that is very easy to identify with, and admire for his dedication to justice and helping the downtrodden.

I feel a have a friend out there doing what I would like to do, but can't.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|User friendly. Accurate and very helpful when your out of bars and your charger decides not to work. Don't pay for one of these apps' you won't be disappointed. Works great on my kindle fire...
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Too many times sc-fi movies rely too much on special effects and the story line is less than stellar. This movie still has great visual effects, but doesn't rely on them so much to move the story along. The story is good, the characters are interesting and engaging. What puts this movie over the top for me is the unbelievable soundtrack. Having a great soundtrack can have as much effect on a movie as any special effect if not more.<br /><br />I had seen this movie and liked it so much that I wanted it to be part of my collection. I like buying from Amazon.com because no matter who is the actual seller, because it is through Amazon.com it is always a pleasant experience. No different with this purchase; great price, fast service and you have your movie in no time. SIT BACK AND ENJOY!

B009329ZF2|2.0|After listening to all the hype thrown at the general public from television promotions I expected much more.  I found the story line to be disjointed and without believable continuity.  Anyone who has knowledge of any warship decommissioned and now serving as a museum knows all major mechanical parts have been disassembled, the 16\\" guns have been permanently plugged and all ammunition has been removed long ago.<br /><br />Also the aliens had placed a force field around their position, only the three guided missile ships inside the field where able to engage the aliens.  Yet the Missouri was able to engage the aliens when it was not inside the shielded area before the force field was dropped.<br /><br />There were many more inconsistencies which combined gave me a very disappointing viewing experience.
1616960922|5.0|Although it's short I feel that it was worth every cent that was spent on it. 'The Emperor's Soul' is a wonderfully beautiful book made to encourage you to ask \\"What if...\\". Sanderson continues to show that he is one of the few true Masters of Fantasy, delivering a complete and wonderful story that will make you hope that he will return to the world of Elantris for a longer stay in the near future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a good book and i really enjoyed it i would suggest it to lots of people very good book.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|A was blindsided with brilliance as I watched The Woman In Black. The cover art and title lent itself to a run of the mill ghost story that may be tolerable. And guess what? It is a fairly typical ghost story, but the film is presented with such rich grounding atmosphere and tight acting that the old fashioned haunted house story is revived without loss.<br /><br />The blu- ray disc is solid and takes the viewer into the perfectly replicated misty past of the Old English countryside. I had no problem getting past any Harry Potter shortcomings that viewers may have unfairly dwelled on. This man can act, and he pulled out all the necessary emotions especially holding to an often sullen demeanor.<br /><br />The film digs deep into haunted house history with creaky doors, spooky structures and amplifies it with modern film-making to create the epitome of the traditional haunted house. The ghostly figure of a female evil spirit lurks and she delivers real spine tinglers. Quietness becomes the enemy as the house has a creep fest around every corner.<br /><br />Great evoking of British mannerisms and phraseology abound. The film stresses aura inducing scenery while you wait for the outcome to unfold. It looks like good old Hammer films are making a comeback as the films opening provides the said logo. It's great to see a ghost story, that really is a ghost story. Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books! I'm reading them for the second time!!!! :-) I know I will read them again as well! When your done its like a piece of you is gone!!!

B007THA4FI|4.0|Book was good, not great<br /><br />I had no issues with fonts etc, on the kindle app for iPad or iPhone
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|My children loved the first Car's movie so we purchased the second one without seeing it previously and they absolutely loved it. I love the 5 disc combo for the digital copy. I was able to download it to our iPad and now we can watch it any where at any time.
0307719219|4.0|I think this hits the issue right on the nose. The authors have made an exhaustive attempt at proving a point, and it's a very dirty picture that they paint of humanity.<br /><br />If you're looking to read this book with the expectation of finding answers and fixes for the world, I suggest you look somewhere else. What these pages really do is show you the depths of human avarice and the absolute disdain with which so many men in positions of power treat those who are below them. If this book actually meant to provide any kind of solution to the problem, it didn't succeed, even though it certainly makes valid points that should be heeded.<br /><br />In my interpretation the true goal of this book is to repeatedly bash you over the head with facts that will help you understand that power corrupts, and that this corrupt power is the source of most of the suffering and poverty in this world. And if you don't end up a more decent human being after reading this book then I fear for the future.<br /><br />On the negative side I'll knock a star off of five because the book is a bit long winded and gets rather difficult to read the further you go. It's not an easy read, but I believe that if it had been shorter, the point might be easier to forget or not conveyed at all. I'm not entirely sure if any of what I said was intentionally done, but I consider the book and authors to have done their job.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book is up to Ken Follett's high standards both in writing style and dramatic though sad content. It's great to be able to carry on the history of the characters introduced in the first book of the series.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is a fantastic headset. The sound is crisp and full, although at high volume large bass can rattle the set which is more a testament to its power. After trying out several wired headsets, the Logitech is liberating and smart. The wireless connection is very strong and can go through several wall, allowing full movement around a house if you are listening to something. The design is sleek and very pleasing to the eye. Logitech really did a wonderful job making this, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys great sound quality, freedom, and great prices.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|Like a lot of people i bought this so that i can use my I-phones with my dock. It is built well. This type of adapter will NEVER work very well and this is why: the wt. of the i-phone plus the thin friction connections plus the extended length of the whole setup makes for a very loose setup. I will go for a cable extender next time, and there WILL be a next time.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is very poorly written and uninspired. After a while I just started skipping over paragraphs to get to the end of a scene and hopefully get to the point. It's almost too descriptive, not leaving anything to the reader's imagination. I don't think I will go on to read the next two books in the series. I honestly couldn't care less what happens to these two characters.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|So why 3 stars for a movie with really impressive visuals and special effect?<br /><br />No argument that the special effects and photography in Avatar are really top notch and very impressive. There's also some pretty good acting in it as well.  But everyone seems to miss the fact that this movie is NOT original.  Original movies sadly seem to be something that Hollywood can no longer produce.  So many of the movies that are coming out today are simply inferior \\"retreads\\" of superior original movies from years gone by and Avatar sadly follows this disappointing trend.<br /><br />Most may not know or remember that back in 2007, one of the first 3D movies to hit the theaters was an interesting animated film called \\"Battle For Terra\\".  Avatar copies the basic plot and main characters of this other movie pretty closely but obviously changes some things around to make it look like a \\"new\\" movie.  You have the \\"ruthless\\" humans who invade a peaceful world in order to exploit its resources and use it for their own purposes in spite of the fact it's already inhabited by a sentient and intelligent species.  In \\"Battle For Terra\\" at least the human's motivation for taking over this planet and terraforming it is a simple matter of raw survival for what's left of the human race.  In Avatar, it's the usual big, evil, greedy industrial military complex that wants to exploit the planet for a special, powerful and very valuable mineral regardless of what the mining efforts may do to the indigenous population and the ecology of the planet and regardless of the wishes of the inhabitants of the planet.<br /><br />So the 3 stars are for the excellent special effects, especially in 3D, and the stunning scenery. But 2 stars come off for it being an unoriginal \\"knockoff\\" of another excellent film.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Cons:<br /><br />-The build quality isn't that high.  Don't get me wrong, the device is very sturdy and made of aluminum (I guess) and doesn't fall apart at all, but the gap tolerances on the bass boost switch and the lack of reinforcement and alignment of the clip is very noticeable, but not to the point of being unusable.  The plastic-cap-at-the-end thing doesn't look professional, either.<br /><br />-You get what you pay for in terms of electronic quality.  After 6 months of daily use, the (usually 10 hour) battery life was consistently about 6-7 hours driving ATH-M30's at maximum volume.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-The build quality also has some nice aspects.  Like I mentioned above, the majority of the case is aluminum, with the clip being the same material, which makes it lighter than it would otherwise be if it were stainless steel.  Also, I'd like to add that the lettering doesn't fade or flake off after heavy pocket travel. Not to mention how many times it's been dropped and has survived.<br /><br />-The equalization, though cheap in nature, is very well-thought-out.  The bass boost feature does exactly what you want it to; it boosts the bass. Fortunately, this does not at all reduce any other bandwidths of any other frequencies.  It is also somewhat linear, not just a single frequency or frequency range is boosted.<br /><br />-The form factor is well suited to pocket travel.  I even frequently clip this amp to the outside of my pocket for volume adjustment on the fly, so I don't have to take out my mp3 player just to adjust the volume.  Doesn't hurt that the edges are rounded for your comfort, too.<br /><br />-The price is superb for the function. At generally less than $20, I would value this little guy at about $35 for all the use it's given me.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />-4/5, would buy again, would recommend, but only if you're not overly anal about audio quality, because there are better products out there for more money (take the e7 for example).  Took away 1 star because of the cheap feel and the fact that it doesn't coat everything i plug into it with gold.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Many others have already expressed this, but I feel that it can't be said enough, so; do NOT buy this bare bones scam job. IF you're like me, you stupidly assumed that the extended version of the film, along with all the extra making of materials would be included in the \\"Limited Edition\\" 3D Blueray version. NOT SO. That has been squeezed into yet another version that is only being released via 2D at this time, with the real-deal 3D super-duper deluxe extended edition to come out yet later (probably for Christmas). Well guess what Fox. I will NOT be buying it. In fact, I will go out of my way not to purchase any of your products ever again.<br /><br />That being said, the 3D on this version is quite beautiful and even better than the theatrical release. I am glad to finally have the 3D version,(and yes, I couldn't wait and also bought the 2D Blueray when it first released)but this will be the \\"definitive\\" version for me.

B0060AY85C|4.0|I sometimes find Toni Morrison's work difficult to understand, with the exception of The Bluest Eye, but Home had me captivated from the first page. She has taken a story of a driven, protective brother (the kind I wish I had), a veteran with probable PTSD, who's on a quest to rescue his sister from a sadistic situation. Along the the way, Ms. Morrison, in the most lyrical prose you'd ever want to read, paints multiple characters so vividly that I would recognize them if they rang my doorbell. I was amazed at how much she said about the family in only a few, short sentences. This is minimalism at it's best. I only wish she had a clearer portrayal of race in her landscape. After all, the setting is Georgia in the 1950's. Still, it's a captivating story that I finished in only two nights. Home is a great read from a master storyteller.
B0010AN7Y0|2.0|This is one of those films that I'm willing to watch, at least in segments, in order to appreciate some very good actors as they make the best a cliched, poorly-written script. As others have noted, this is really just a Transatlantic imitation of The Big Chill. I don't like that film much, either, and so I'm of course not going to be crazy about watching an imitator. There are some clever lines, I will admit, but each character has become mired in his or her personal rut since the group last reunited, and each rut is stated and restated and analyzed in about every facile and melodramatic manner one could imagine. Still, there's a lot of talent on that screen, and while I cringe at the script I can admire the actors' attempts to salvage it. At some point, however, there will come a point where I won't be able to watch even a few minutes of this disappointing film anymore, and I suspect that point will arrive early next year.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Solid information about what went down.  While I don't condone the release of classified information, I would say that if our commander and chief can release classified information to improve his image as our \\"great leader\\" than more power to the guys that have to carry out his orders.  Personally, as a retired military officer I suspect our commander in chief has no idea what he is really doing when it comes to military orders and asking these guys to step into harms way.  When they get killed it becomes a \\"not optimal\\" situation as he alluded to today.  God bless our special forces and all of our troops wearing the uniform of the United States of America!
0307960471|3.0|The story gets lost among the drugs. Query ? is there such a drug as violin? Nesbo thinks Oslo is the capital of the world.

I would hope to see Harry Hole alive and in a new novel. Conan Doyle brought Sherlock Holmes back.

B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|I will just say now that this album is badass it combines the powerful guitar work of Tony Iommi and the pure metal vocals of Ian Gillen. I will agree with many that the original mix of this album kinda sucks but when you evolve it to the deluxe edition they sound so much better so you can really admire Gillens screams which really add the evil effect to the song Disturbing the preist which goes down as one of my favorite sabbath songs along with Children of the grave, Heaven and Hell and Headless cross. If you re a hard core sabbath fan you need to buy this album it brings you back to when sabbath made people thing pure evil when you put their work on your turn table (CD player). I cannot say anything bad about this album it is evil, hard,and all together a kick ass album that can be praised.<br />I love this album and I am sure you wil too it may not shoot up to your #1 favorite album like it did for me but after all it is Black Sabbath and Ian gillen whats not to love?<br /><br />okay I admit it the cover art is a bit wierd but it is so wierd it is awesome. it for me is the perfect item to have sitting on your shelf staring at you with it's demonic eyes

0880796863|1.0|the colors are way off and quite ugly, they blur and  the lines are quite thick, and lacking of detail. this is basically a reprint of a reprint of a reprint, the book that comes with is fine though. when compared to a friend's deck who got me into tarot, these just dont work at all and i dont get the same intuition as i do from his deck that he let me barrow, and his are over 13 years old, these look brand new but are as said before absent of the same vibrant color and detail. and that is important. just a bad experience for a first time buyer of tarot cards. i did want rider waite deck though, thats about the only thing they got right. could any one recommend the original to me with the same vivid colors and detail that i am seeking?

1577314808|1.0|I have read psychology and enlightenment books for decades. Someone recommended this book so I bought it. I'm reading books with a friend that has terrible problem being in the here and now - always daydreaming, mulling, seldom mindful. Well, we hated this book and learned nothing useful. We didn't like the author's attitude, didn't like some of the generalizations he made, and it is true that his ideas could be distilled down to a pamphlet. The author is correct in that one of the biggest keys to happiness and relational success IS mindfulness - staying in the here and now. But this book didn't provide anything that would allow someone to really change in our opinion. It has obviously helped some folks, so I'm happy for them. But if it didn't help you, or you want to buy a couple of books, let me mention a book that finally did help: \\"Growing Yourself Back Up\\" by John Lee. Now I always dislike it when folks mention other books in their reviews for obvious reasons. Well, I do not know this man, but he is very, very wise. Of all the books we read, THAT book gave real power to understanding why one is not mindful and how to heal so as to be able to stay in the here and now. Even brought some tears. That book ought to be required reading for all young adults! Cheers.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I travel a fair amount for business and much as I hate the word, I have to admit I've turned into a foodie.  This impacts my eating both at home and when on the road for work.  Urbanspoon, Yelp and TripAdvisor are must-haves as a group, but none should be used individually.  If a restaurant gets high marks on just one of the three, it's a judgment call.  Two of the three is a safe bet and all three makes it a likely guarantee (although altogether too many low-end but frequently-visited places get oversampled and turn into \\"noise\\").

B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read this book. I am not one for the whole bondage thing but once I started reading I realized it wasn't about that at all. It's a love story. Its a love story that kept me wanting to read. As the book progresses into the love story it makes the reader wanting to root for Ana and Christian. That they have a love that is so pure, honest and captivating. I do not want to give the story away but it's a must read!!!
B000T433CO|5.0|This is the kind of movie I really like: Good actors, light-hearted and humorous. It has romance, mild adventure and a few surprises! An easy to watch movie that I will watch again, probably at Christmas time.
B004L03B3S|3.0|At the end of the film, a credit reads \\"To my parents.\\" So maybe this was a faithful retelling of the writer's childhood. But a good director has to be mindful of his audience and its needs. The film was 96 minutes: of that the first 33 are wasted on the gigglings and pranks of the half-brothers when they were little (6 and 12 respectively). A two minute voiceover could have dispensed with this waste of time and moved the narrative forward. Then there is the incessant piano music, pleasant at first but distracting soon after. Rafael Cardoso (Thom&aacute;s) has a pure and lyrical beauty and a beautiful set of glutes. The guy who plays his brother is so-so.<br /><br />It would have been better to have more time between the two grownup brothers, but a considerable amount of time is wasted when Thom&aacute;s goes off to Russia to train for the Olympics (3 years!). It would have been nice to have more revealing conversations between the brothers, and as a gay film, some erotic sex would have been a definite perk. Hope to see more of Mr. Cardoso. One would have to assume that the director is a not-well-read beginner. About 15 minutes of gorgeous screen time, less than a sixth of the running time. Too bad.

B002RHGYOA|5.0|If I ever read a book with bated breath - it was \\"The Girl who played with Fire\\" it is the third - and sadly the last - of the \\"Millennium\\" trilogy by Stieg Larsson. Not only can't you put it down for a second, the plot weaves around a large number of Personae, is complex yet logical, it has a large number of characters that appeared in the first two volumes, but the book takes a completely different slant of the same main characters.<br />Definitely a \\"Must Read\\".

The first sentence set the scene and I really became involved in the story very quickly.<br />Delightfully written, with plenty of action. It left me with the desire to read the next book in the series.

B007SGM084|3.0|It's a fun romp with a soft peek at BDSM, well, at least for awhile. Then it's repetitive. Very repetitive. Ridiculously repetitive. Green Eggs and Ham is less repetitive. Shame on the editors for not nipping out the repetitive descriptions of Christians looks. Egads! He's handsome. He has gray eyes. He's hot. He's sexy. He's moody. We got it the first 50 times- no need to repeat over and over. But, if they had trimmed just those repetitions (let alone the repetitious explosive orgasm scenes) then it would only be one and half books.

0345803507|2.0|I succumbed to the relentless buzz I'd heard about this trilogy and finally got around to reading it. The biggest element that seems to have everyone talking is the BDSM. I immediately thought of the book that introduced that theme to me, The Story of O, which I loved. This is no story of O. Believe me. It started out well and I thought things were chugging along, but then it all just got silly. For instance, sure, there are people in the world who have no love for money, meaning that riches are not what they actively seek or desire to be happy, but are we the readers supposed to believe that Ana who had a little over %600 in her bank account was unimpressed with her boyfriend's wealth throughout the whole series? Come on! There were some decent bits throughout the three books that had those been concentrated on, probably would have made a really decent BOOK rather than multiple volumes. The sex was graphic, but I've read better porn. Since they were having sex seemingly every ten pages, it just got to be boring and over the top. I guess it's true what they say: \\"The more you get it, the less you want it.\\" That was certainly my feeling while reading. All in all, it was okay and it made the time go faster until the library got in some books that I really want to read.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I bought Ms. Rowling's book out of curiosity. If my opinion can save any of you from reading this very disappointing trite piece of airport trash, I will have done you a favour. The characters are one dimensional and stereotyped, the situation contrived. Ms Rowling must be a very dark person, none of the characters have ANY redeeming social value. The children hate their parents and do teen age rebellious stuff (who would imagine such a thing?) The grownups are either drunk, having sex with the wrong people, violent, or terrified. Everything gets worse, in a totally predictable way. Its like reading a trashy People type magazine about people you would never want to meet in a place you would never want to go. Give it a miss!
B0065GC0BA|1.0|Did anyone else notice that the ultimate message of this book is that a disabled life is not worth living, even despite a caring family, endless wealth, the best medical care, and (by the end of the book) a devoted, loving romantic partner? For a while I was enjoying the story, but by the end I was deeply distressed about the moral and ethical implications of the book's ending. The book juxtaposes an adventurous, athletic, and sexually active lifestyle with life in a wheelchair - and decides that life in a wheelchair is not worth living. For those of us with close friends or loved ones with similar disabilities, this is a disturbing and morally callous ending.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really like this app because instead of looking at the battery compartment in the top right corner and guessing how much battery I have I can know the exact amount. Plus, this app is free!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. The twists and turns are great. Cannot wait to see the movie and read the rest of the series.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|It really does alternate between predictable plot twists and stupid plot twists for the sake of having yet another \\"exciting\\" plot twist.  Could Hollywood please hire some half way decent writers and stop this bull&*&* writing by committee?
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|there is nothing average about this whole movie.  the students have to go to a school to so with there powers if they are a hero or a villain.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Having only read reviews about \\"Game of Thrones\\" I thought I was taking a chance (albeit a pretty safe one from the Emmy nominations alone) on purchasing Season 1. Wow! Spectacular! Great plot. Fantastic art direction and cinematography. Incredible acting. What else could you ask for? More than worth it. You absolutely owe it to yourself to see this series.

B004JRVQX0|2.0|I have nothing productive to say about the whole mentality behind USB security dongles, so this review is only about the hardware itself.<br /><br />Compared to the previous iLok, this version is physically smaller and holds more licenses.  I never had a problem with either of those things, but I can understand how they were an annoyance to others.<br /><br />This new version, though, has been a nightmare.  The USB connector is simply too loose to provide a secure connection.  I'm regularly interrupted by \\"you're not authorized\\" error messages from PLAY and Altiverb, because the slightest breeze is enough to dislodge it.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another impressive read from the man about the man.  Loved it all the way and will look forward to many more.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent book. It's amazing what our devoted service members put themselves thru to protect us and our interests. Reading 'No Easy Day' puts the reader \\"right into the action\\" as the events unfold. They have our deepest respect and will always be in our prayers.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games so much I bought all three books and am now finishing The Mockingjay.<br />Catching Fire continues the story with Katniss returning to the arena, and this time there appears to be no escaping the Capital's revenge.<br />These books draw our attention to how love, loyalty, and justice all fall by the wayside during times of confliict. The very things we fight for are the first to be sacrificed in war.<br />Her story development is steady and smooth and I like the way she reintroduces characters that were mentioned earlier. I can't wait to see what happens!

044024367X|1.0|After reading  9 Reacher books previously, and enjoying them all, I was cautious when I noticed this one's rating as I ordered. The more I read of \\" Nothing To Lose\\" , the more I realized even the low rating was overstated. I was particularly  disappointed when  the author's arrogant English heritage surfaced in his attempt at political assessment of the U.S. military and our government in the last half of the book!

B009SJ46EA|4.0|I loved season one, and this pilot to season 2 was a lot to take in, grasp, absorb and remeber and left a lot hanging... as did all of season one, but season one didn't throw as much intense thoughts, twists, and cliff hangers at you as the pilot last year. I think you need to watch it a few times, but it won't be hard because it's amazing. Acting is spot on. Can't wait for next weak!
0062502174|4.0|this book start with a great start-off-chapters but eventually the story-line becomes moderate compared to its first chapters. also it has understandable language (smooth literature) that make it easy and enjoyable.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I just bought the deluxe edition and definitively  I love this album...lyrics are good, sound is awesome but on the song \\"Hanging On\\" I don't know who was the idea to include a rap verse that for my opinion was unnecessary.I wish i can edit that part but is a really good album I just loved it immediately...good job Ms.Goulding a fan forever!<br />Ps: Why \\"Lights\\" is in this album again?
145162445X|5.0|Professor Lawrence Krauss does an excellent job illuminating what we know about the cosmos which putatively sprang from nothing - but he does not pursue an exploration of that nothingness. That is probably because he sprang from a culture that adamantly refuses to recognize any nonmaterial transcendent reality.  Implicit in that culture is the notion that reality is only that which can be touched, seen, described, and measured.  Krauss only circumnavigates the nothingness that generates and sustains the spectacularly tangible somethingness that we experience and contemplate.<br /><br />A recently-published book entitled  My Universe - A Transcendent Reality explores the nothingness that spawns the somethingness of the cosmos.  Indeed, it explores the idea that our cosmos and other possible coexisting cosmi are but material subsets of the universe - the one foundational transcendent reality beyond measurement, definition, or description.  The book suggests a rational framework for explaining how the cosmos sprang from a preexisting transcendent nothingness. [...]

B0097NGUJG|5.0|You will not regret this album, just buy it.  After you listen to it three or four times you'll be glad you made the purchase, and run and tell your friends about this cool new band, because something this good shouldn't be kept a secrete.  It's hard to explain what it sounds like, but a good sample to listen to might be  \\"Fitzpleasure\\" or \\"Something Good.\\"  It really is an amazing album and you'll dig it if you like bands like Turin Brakes, Radiohead, Band Of Horses, and Grandaddy.
B003YL4KS0|2.0|I found there was nothing in this book that I hadn't read online already. If you are starting your research then this is a good place to start. If you have been reading curly haired blogs for the past few weeks this book will disappoint. I hoped the videos would help (kindle edition) But they were brief and fairly redundant since they were demonstrating what was already written. Many of the images did not load in my kindle edition either.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't been obsessed with a story like this in I don't know how long.  Wool is a story that includes elements of harsh reality, ancient lore, desolate wastelands and a real human connection.  Bookmarked for when the author releases new stories set in this world. Cannot wait.
B01MXDEXCW|4.0|It’s not “great” and there are no “wow” moments, but this movie is a nonstop action sequence and I find it pretty entertaining…even if I probably won’t want to see it again for another 10 years. LOL.<br /><br />It seems that asking folks to list the Resident Evil movies in order of quality would be harder than getting an entire theater of fans to agree on pizza toppings—I’d say 1, 3, 5, 2, 4.  This fifth franchise installment, as with each of its predecessors, manages to deliver a new take on presenting the Resident Evil world and the next step in an elaborately plot-holey but perfectly followable plot.  The movie opens with a franchise recap (Milla’s typical narration) before picking up right where Afterlife (2010) left off.<br /><br />Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil 1 & 4-6, Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) continues to helm the beloved Zompocalypse franchise and continues to spread his love of slow-motion during our opening action sequences.  The irreplaceable Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, Resident Evil 1-6, Ultraviolet) returns as Alice fighting her way out of an Umbrella corporation virus outbreak simulation facility.  She is joined by Ada Wong (Bingbing Li; Transformers: Age of Extinction), who is butt-kickin’ cute in her gun-geisha mistress outfit.  She also bumps into her Jovo-clone’s daughter (Aryana Engineer; Orphan) and her simulation clone neighbor (Michelle Rodriguez; Resident Evil, The Fate of the Furious).<br /><br />Of course, at some point, Alice wakes up and spends abundant screen time scantily clad in a research facility before finding a ninja dominatrix outfit and all the weapons she could ever want.  Just conveniently waiting for her just like when Beckinsale awakens from her cryo-chamber in Underworld: Awakening to find her boots and leathers “right there.” Shortly after Alice’s hips and side-boob show, Wesker (Shawn Roberts; Resident Evil 4-6, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage) appears to drop an exposition bomb to explain the whole movie to us.<br /><br />Under orders from the Red Queen, they are being hunted by Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory; Resident Evil 2 & 4) who is controlled by some weird mechanized heart-spider (that never gets explained) attached to her sternum which, like her cleavage, goes well-exposed throughout the movie.  At Valentine’s side are Rain (Michelle Rodriguez; Resident Evil, The Fate of the Furious) and Todd (Oded Fehr; Resident Evil 3-4), both bad guy clones of Alice’s former friends.  During this pursuit, a team including Kevin Durand (Legion, Real Steel) and Boris Kodjoe (Resident Evil: Afterlife, Surrogates) are working their way into the Umbrella facility to rescue Alice and Ada…and they’re working for Wesker!?!?!<br /><br />The theme of the movie is “Evil Goes Global.”  But nothing felt particularly global about it (until the very last scene).  The tone and setting was notably less effective than previous franchise installments.  The global element seemed that the simulation facility has different cityscapes—which Alice goes through like video game stages, one after the other—which emulate Moscow, Tokyo, Suburbia, and so on, so that potential world power buyers could see how a virus outbreak would affect their enemy nation’s metropolises.  All that these “stages” accomplished was making the franchise feel like a video game; a fault which, until the release of this installment, the franchise had successfully avoided.<br /><br />Throughout these levels we find undead Russian soldiers, the giant hulking ogres from Afterlife and they still throw their axes in slow-motion, and we see a lot of a super-sized tongue lasher monster from first Resident Evil.  However, the execution of their action is rather lackluster.<br /><br />Featuring solid zombie attack action and combat choreography, I liked the bright white hallway action sequence.  The gunshot blood-splatter gore was occasionally decent, but left much to be desired.  In fact, I could say that about most of the action.  The sprinting zombies with their quad-unhinging tentacle jaws (like Blade II’s vampires) were cool…at first.  What happened?  Similarly shocking, the hand-to-hand combat was best in the franchise, but it lacked good finishers and standout moments.<br /><br />Minus a few story-building scenes, this movie essentially boils down to a continuous 90-minute action sequence.  This probably sounds amazing, right?  It wasn’t.  All the action felt a lot like “background action” in an otherwise great action movie.  You know?  Like when Optimus Prime was fighting Megatron, there were soldiers and other Autobots fighting Decepticons in the background (and it looked good), but nothing particularly cool would happen with the background fighters while the camera was focusing on the two heavy hitters.  In Retribution, this action is never punctuated by awesome moments; there are no highlights or climaxes.  Perhaps worst of all was the arctic martial arts finale between Alice, Rain, Valentine and others.  Hand-to-hand, Asian weapons, guns, and a lot of clever choreography…it was all entertaining. Very entertaining.  But I kept waiting for the “Wow.”  It never came.<br /><br />The movie ends with a very Terminator-SkyNet apocalypse standoff at the White House between the remainder of humanity against a legion of Resident Evil beasts as if the videogames vomited all over the screen (perhaps in a good way).  So, as they tend to, they could easily pick up part 6 at the exact moment that closes Retribution, much as Retribution did with Afterlife (2010).<br /><br />I have had a blast revisiting these films. Even the lesser installments are fun to watch (as long as it’s been a while).  Looking forward to part 6.ired.  In fact, I could say that about most of the action.

0374214913|5.0|What a treat to read such a well-crafted book. The charm of the antiquarian bookstore blended with the mystery of hidden codes and a secret society. The perfect blend of the of the old and new. Find a comfortable chair, a glass of amber to sip, and a few hours to immerse yourself in a lovely mystery that is as young as it is old.

0714864803|5.0|The Lebanese Kitchen by Salma Hage (author) and Toby Glanville (photographer) is the best Lebanese cookbook EVER!  I have several on my bookshelf, but this one is like being in my dear Mother's kitchen, throughout my childhood, right at her elbow, helping to cook dinner, and then, eating her fabulous Lebanese food.  The recipes are simple, uncluttered, and authentic, and are accompanied by photographs which do the food justice.  I am only realizing now, with this book, that what I always thought were recipes my Mother made up OR culled from The Los Angeles Times, are, in fact, traditional Lebanese recipes (for example, pickled turnips).  I have an eight year old grandnephew who loves to cook, and this book is going to be one of his presents at this holiday season.  His mother, my niece and goddaughter, learned to cook Lebanese food from both her sittos (one of them, my Mother), and from her mother, and keeps the tradition alive.  So this book will be well used in both of our kitchens.  When I left home, decades ago, I sat with my Mother for several hours, writing out in long hand with pencil, a handful of my favorites of her recipes.  I have them to this day, but this cookbook makes my Mother's legacy to me, permanent. Even tho Lebanon is small, there may still be some regional variations, so sometimes, Lebanese recipes don't ring true for me when I see them in various newspapers, but these recipes are exactly how my Mother cooked. I am overjoyed at discovering this book, thanks to Maureen Abood's lovely review. As always, food is one of the main instruments by which culture is carried through time, so this book, in addition to being a valuable culinary tool, also preserves our culture for second and third generation Lebanese-Americans and their children and grandchildren.

B000002ITW|4.0|Agree totally with every positive review on this absolutely essential CSNY album. What is surprising though, is that no-one (I have not been through each and every review, admittedly), seems to have made mention of the incredible drumming by Johnny Barbata on this set. I have never been huge into drumming at all, but each time I listen to this album, I cannot help but note that this guy has got to have been the most incredible improvisor I have ever heard. He never seems to repeat a particular style/type. I had never heard of him before this album, and have never heard of him since. Seems a crying shame somehow.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|The book was a little slow to capture my attention at first, but I was soon captivated by the story.  As the reader is taken through the journey of each of the girls lives, they are introduced to valuable lessons.  It is a lovely and inspiring book.
B000KLRUKC|5.0|This has Tebaldi, Simionato, Bergonzi, and MacNeil at their golden-voiced peaks in one of the great recordings of Verdi's masterpiece.  Would that I had Decca's timing in drinking my vintage wines. I much prefer it to the Solti performance of similar vintage with Leontyne Price and Jon Vickers, although undoubtedly those more powerful voices also generate a special frisson.<br /><br />The subject recording's conductor is Herr von Karajan, never my favorite orchestral maestro, but in opera he was good to his singers.  Here he is superbly supportive, even Italianate, and not consumed with painting perfect surfaces as he tended to be later on.  Solti ruins his Aida cast by Wagnerizing and blasting his way through it, abetted by a blindingly bright Italian brass section.  I'm glad to have both but the majesty and emotional truth of Verdi is far better conveyed by Tebaldi, Bergonzi (I have come to re-assess him as the finest Verdi tenor of the last 50 years), and company. The sound is excellent Decca stereo, a bit coarse but not significantly bettered over the last 50 years.

B008FSCNTK|2.0|If you look at the cover art, the glamorous Ms. Krall, donning garter and bustier looks very much like the music she is trying to create in her latest offering. Unfortunately, her mellifluous voice is not a match for the rusty, honky-tonk tunes. The frail tenderness of her beautiful instrument that works so well with standards and virtually everything else she's attempted falls short here. I'm still in love with her, but this is not going into my heavy rotation and may in-fact slip into the \\"overflow\\" pile of CD's.<br /><br />At the same time I bought this CD, I purchased Rufus Wainwright's new, \\"Out of the Game\\". For a second, I thought I may have swapped discs. I started to wonder what this would have sounded like under his control. Sometimes artists that make bold directional changes succeed. (Krall only need turn her head in bed to see a master of this game.) Sometimes they don't. Perhaps, next time.

I would highly recommend reading this as well as the final book in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Freed.

B00829GFZ0|5.0|As hard as this may to beleive.  This is the best CD/MP3 download of the decade.  Every song is a Winner.  If you hunger for Bands like oldschool Heart/Humble Pie/Led Zeppelin then Rival Sons has it in spades.<br /><br />I will now go though the songs<br /><br />Keep on Swinging - is a great songs with an infections chrous.  Its almost like James Brown lyrics over the groove of a Led Zeppelin song.  Think of James Brown I feel good mixed with Led Zeppelins Nobodys fault but mine.<br /><br />Wild Animals - Is a song that feel like the Rival Sons are channeling the Zombies/The Animals in terms of tone.  Great song with infectious hooks and groove.<br /><br />You want to - This song is a rocker fully charged.  They really pick up the pace lots of Wah Wah guitar in this one.  Fuzz tones as well.  The break down really showcases Jay Bucannon's vocal range.<br /><br />Until The Sun Comes - Feels very Beach Boys in terms of Summery good times. This is the type of song you want to play at a beach party with Coke and Chips and Hot dogs cooking on the grill.<br /><br />Run from Revelation - Is a great Blues song that has a rough feel to it.<br /><br />Jordan is a Long winding Ballad that has a very church gospel feel.  Imagine if The Rolling Stones stretched out and slowed down their Song \\"You can't always get what you want\\".<br /><br />All the Way - Plays off a Bad Company riff of their song I can't get enough of your love.<br /><br />The Heist - This Song reminds me of The Doors The Wasp.  Its a great story and The whole band really comes together the middle part is very Doors like with the Scott Holiday channeling Robbie Krieger Spidery Rattlesnake guitar lines.<br /><br />Three Fingers - Is a song that goes for the throat.  Another Rocker that burns and burns as the track goes by.<br /><br />Nava - Is a acoustic song that takes hints of Led Zeppelin's That's the Way/Going to California.  Its a great instrumental.<br /><br />Manifest Destiny - is the crown jewel of Head Down.  This song is what many bands wish they could produce.<br />The riff sounds like Led Zeppelin's When the Levee breaks but slowed to the temple of Dazed and Confused.  The chorus \\" You know were dealing with Godless Men.  Is Hauntingly Beautiful. Rival Sons really put there Soul into this song.  This is a Native Tragedy.<br /><br />Manifest Destiny 2 is just as great as well.  They really can put things together.  This song is The revenge part of the song.  It feels like a duel some ways.<br /><br />True - A nice relaxing ballad to close Head Down with.  Very Tim Harding like If I was a Carpenter striped down.<br /><br />All in all.  Head Down is one of the better albums I have head this year.  This is even better than some of the latest releases from Classic Rocks usual suspects.  Its a must have and every song is a winner.  If you like Led Zeppelin 1 and 2.  The Rolling Stones Sticky Fingers.  Heart's Little Queen.  Then this is the music for you.  They actually took about 22 days or so to come up with the songs For Head Down.  There is an urgency and fire to the music.  This blows away their last release Pressure and Time.  I saw them in concert in Jan 2012.  They really love what they do and always put a little twist to their live shows.<br /><br />From shifting Vocal phrases,sliding different guitar licks, tribal drum part, Making the bass funky and sparse within the same song.<br /><br />I can't stop playing it.<br /><br />Head Down is a must for any music lover of Rock and Roll.

B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Ok, so maybe I should actually read the game descriptions better before I click &quot;buy me!&quot;  I bought this game, thinking it was a Hidden Object Game (HOG).  It's definitely NOT a HOG. What it is however, is a puzzle game.  You have to open up pieces of a portrait, and each piece of the portrait is 8 puzzles.  Then there is a small (very small) HOG portion where you look for your next portrait piece/puzzle pack.  I am actually surprising myself and am doing the puzzles and haven't given up or looked up any answers.  The puzzles themselves are challenging, but not so hard that I cant figure them out.  Some are harder then others, and it appears that they increase in difficulty as you go along. Oh, and you're timed. You have a set amount of time to finish each group of 8 puzzles.  So all in all it seems like a great game. Not what I was expecting (but like I said, that was totally my own fault) but I have a feeling of accomplishment that I really like, so maybe I'll even try Part 2 when I finish this one!! If I finish this and have anything to change (or add) to my review, I will update this review. Now back to gaming!!
B000000OUE|5.0|I'm honestly hearing this album for the first time in it's entirety as I write this.  I'm four songs into it and this is extremely heavy for its time.  I can see why a lot of people have deemed White Zombie as one of the best heavy metal bands ever.  This CD is awesome and I'm glad I have the chance to hear.  This album is most definitely staying on my iPod, no question about it!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and the ending will blow you away. Great for book clubs, lots of topics to discuss. You will not be disappointed with this book. Can't wait to see what the author writes next!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazingly well written and filled with so much emotion. I honestly didn't think I would be as impressed as I am. I cannot wait to read the rest of this trilogy!
0307744434|5.0|This book is wonderful. It is engaging, atmospheric, and one of the few that completely transports you as you read it and stays with you after. It is touching and complicated, beautiful and original~ truly excellent.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Very good product worth the money i tried many othet fm transmitters this one is better then all. Only thing wish screen would been a little bigger
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Overall a very good app.  I started with the trial, and liked it enough I paid the (slightly high) price for the full version.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Syncs with, and editable through my Google Calendar for easy updating.<br />2. Intuitive task input and viewing.<br />3. Very easy to update/edit tasks<br />4. Sm/Med/Lg text size.  Though, the small and medium selection is reversed on my GS3 for some reason.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Unable to indent or sort my items for the DAY in any order. For example, if I have a sequence of events on my todo list, I can't put them in the order I want to do them without having every event for every day included in that list.  ***I would like to be able to re-arrange the half dozen tasks for tomorrow without having to wade through the dozen or more tasks for today and the day after tomorrow!<br />2. The price is slightly high.  I'm a cheapskate.<br /><br />Overall, a good app, and even though I complain about the price, I use it enough that it's well worth it.  I just hope they fix the sort!
0345803485|5.0|I totally loved this book. Can't wait to read the 2nd book! This book is very descriptive and leaves you wanting more!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is another great book by Rick Riordan! I have read all the series he has written and it did not disappoint. This one was more focused on character building and less action, but still a classic.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The batteries I received had no date on them.  They are genuine Maxell batteries, and they are marked \\"Made in Japan\\".  These are priced very reasonably.  A package of two Energizer brand is selling for $6.49 at a local store.  I don't know how Energizer compares to Maxell.<br />Shipping time was very fast.  I will update the review if these batteries do not last a reasonable amount of time.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm not a gamer and always wonder how my husband can spend hours playing xBox, but this game had me hooked.  I couldn't put it down and stayed up far too late trying to solve the mystery. Very fun and worth the $2.
B008AT71WI|4.0|Oone of my all-time favorite films is finally in my hands on Bu-Ray, with its alternate ending restored, of course!<br />VQ is fantastic, and those that think the alternate ending may not look good, I think it actually looks better than the<br />re-shot ending! It looks as if the film came out just yesterday. The audio would've been given full marks, had it<br />not been for some obvious missing sound effects and music in the Director's Cut.<br /><br />It definitely could have used a better editor, both visually and on the audio side. I noticed many problems in the<br />films Oscar-nominated \\"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space\\" musical number. Despite this, I still love the film,<br />and the Director's Cut's Big Damn Finale is way better than its not-so-subtle parody of most musical happy<br />endings. All extras are ported over besides one new interview about the Director's Cut, as well as a sorta<br />hidden commentary for the original ending, which isn't anything you can't look up on the internet, but it's<br />still nice to hear it directly from those involved. Another disappointing factor is the main menu, which is the<br />standard \\"cover art with the options in a drop-down\\" that most catalog releases get. And I miss Frank Oz's<br />evil laugh in the rough cut of the alternate ending after spitting out Seymour's glasses. That didn't need<br />replaced! IT WAS PERFECT! All minor quibbles aside, it looks great (both versions get a four and a half rating),<br />sounds great (the Theatrical Version's audio gets full marks, and the Director's cut gets a solid four) and as<br />much as I'd love to have a brand-new, full-length commentary or something, the original ending in full 1080p is<br />absolutely breathtaking and worth the purchase alone! Though it's lacking in the extras and presentation<br />department (I don't care much for digibooks and this one wasn't really an exception) I still highly recommend<br />this to any Little Shop of Horrors veterans, and especially those who have never seen this thrilling and fresh<br />take on the musical scene.ecially those who have never seen this thrilling and fresh<br />take on the musical scene.
034580404X|5.0|Sexually graphic subject matter is not for everyone.  Opened my eyes to what's out there!  Definitely not the norm!  Make sure these books are read in order.
B009I0QTF8|5.0|I was familiar with Flying Lotus due to word of mouth, but I hadn't really given his music enough attention to form an opinion of my own, thus my thoughts on \\"Until The Quiet Comes\\" are from a rare perspective of ignorance and this, I believe, always benefits the product, which exists as the singular portal into the Qualia of someone else, whose life and universe is a mystery yet to our own. Without awareness of the artist, his/her identity is sought through encounter with the art which, in circumstances, creates a more intimate bond with the work as opposed to its creator. In the digital age, the age of celebrity, this type of listening experience happens less and less, though when it is possible it is especially intriguing. This may be the last record Flying Lotus could make with that type of unique charm and this is due to the especially well regard this record has surrounding it and the potential successes and attention it will bestow on its mysterious creator(who may or may not be an inter-dimensional petunia smuggler), although I'm quite aware his earlier work has been exceptionally applauded as well. Commencing immediately following my initial listen of \\"Until the Quiet Comes\\" I was struck by how it had felt like a dream, or like dream language regurgitated from the psyche of a musicologist with intimate knowledge of Jazz, drug culture, cinema, R&B, futurism, nature, technology, street life, cartoons... As a dream it is difficult to grasp any one song on \\"Until the Quiet Comes\\" as a fully developed entity existing alongside equally developed separate entities, as each individual track is the embryonic symbolization of one hundred influences absorbed in experience into the subconscious of its creator, manifesting to the conscious, or listener, in dream language and disappearing before it has fully gestated into a traditional song state. It is nearly hallucinatory listening to the entirety of the album in a single sitting, as there is imagery ingrained into theshifting soundscape that refuses to adhere to an identifiable shape, merely teasing the listener as it unfurls in the red night, leading one into a psychedelic frenzy or calm, depending on the environment, as a strange narcotic could if it were as gentle as a companion; dusted, hazy light spun in drunk butterfly colors from a rickety projector directed at no point of focus and shot through with purple smoke...or...a sketch pad filled with unrealized notations of a beautiful madness that nearly attain a profoundness before breaking into an entirely new but similarly enlightened stream of consciousness so that you never get the full idea but only vague associations that result in a quite vivid listening experience man, one that may result in a long-winded critique muddled with abstract metaphors that don't quite capture the full magnitude of the feeling, but does well enough to hopefully convince any reader who has made it thus far to purchase \\"Until the Quiet Comes\\". It's a worthwhile trip.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great game. You can play a level and come back later to do the next one. Perfect time waster. Music and graphics are very good.
0714843377|3.0|Read a few pages in a book store a while back, and found myself ordering it a few days later. Short and sweet to the point, good visuals, and some good ideas and motivational words of wisdom. Not the greatest, not the worst, In all honesty, id go and pick it up in a shop, read through it and save yourself the $10 bucks
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Too few works of literature sing with courage these days. Most popular writing, the novels of the airport bookstore variety, slide into formulaic predictability rather quickly, their characters perennially tough against all odds, their plots teeming with international intrigue, happenstance romance, or lackluster humor. Cheryl Strayed's Wild is not of that genre. It is not a guidebook for the Pacific Crest Trail, either. It is, by all accounts, a soul-searching, arduous trek, honest and deep. And that trek is on many levels, from the physical to the intensely emotional. Like all good books, it mirrors aspects of life common to us all, the pain, the love, the sadness of regret, and the profound joy of simply existing on a glorious day. Congratulations, Ms. Strayed for a beautiful book.<br />Andrew L. MacNair, author
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a great story!  cant wait for the next one!!!!!  had me mad,sad and happy the entire read!  thoroughly recommend this series!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Was very good always works for me. I am always able to get the videos that I want from YouTube with no problems.
B007SGM084|5.0|From a psychological standpoint, I found this trilogy to be very powerful and intense.  Loved how the author allowed the reader to know what was going on in Anna's head throughout the whole novel.<br />E L James-great work!  Look forward to another book from you!
0307744434|5.0|This was a very magical book.<br /><br />I doubt that at this point it's a spoiler to say that the main protags are in competition with each other. However, it's handled in a very non-obvious way, and has more to do with thesis/antithesis/synthesis... if one wants to get all philosophical!<br /><br />I really liked it. The characters were well-drawn- very important! The \\"world\\" was magical and never explicitly explained... but it did make intuitive sense. And the Night Circus itself was amazing!<br /><br />I mostly read genre fiction, and this was more \\"mainstream\\" then I tend to prefer. But- a REALLY interesting and engaging book!
0345803485|1.0|I am using my husband's account to write this review.<br /><br />Fifty shades of gray is the only book in my life that I could not finish reading. It is boring, badly written, and repetitive. It was taking away the joy of reading for me and it didn't even make me horny!!!! So I realized I could just put in in the garbage. Good thing that I did not buy the trilogy!!! So, I wonder, who in the world are all those people reading this book? people who never read books? people who can't read?  Juana (50 years old)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I saw the Avengers movie in theaters and really enjoyed how it tied together the story lines from Hulk, Thor, Iron Man and Captain America.  Looking forward to the next movie.  Having a home theater system I typically only go to see movies that I think would look great on the big screen, and the rest I simply wait to watch on my big screen.  This movie looked even better on the plasma screen and the sound really popped on my surround sound system - and my system is a bit old.  I have a 5.1 Yamaha surround sound system and the movie sounded awesome so if you've got something like a modern 7.1 system you should feel it even more.<br /><br />I'm not a 3D movie fan, although I saw this movie in the theaters in 3D.  I didn't think the 3D really added anything to the movie.  There are few movies that I really appreciate for their 3D effects.  I thought Avatar was particularly good in 3D, but I don't think every movie is a good candidate for 3D.  That said, I enjoyed the movie as much on my T.V., as I did in the theater.  I recommend this.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|enjoy game but i am not going to spend real money for no prize.  i refuse to purchase additional money to buy more coins to get nothing maybe they should offer a prize to the highest score in a month might bring more revenue.
B0095R64AO|4.0|It was a good movie but it was too drawn out.  Great cast of characters.  Glad to see Zingerman's deli in the movie, didn't know they filmed here in Michigan.
B003B02PFO|5.0|What can you say about John Grisham. To speak about<br />him is like a dog barking at the moon.<br /><br />He's just a wonderful writer.<br /><br />This is a funny story - would make a hilarious movie.<br />I can't wait to see who the characters will be.
B00846REIS|2.0|To be honest it was a bad version of 50 shades. The only substance to the book was the sex scenes. other then that no plot, and terrible ending.
B008PDROCQ|5.0|Remastering sounds great. There are no bonus tracks. As far as I can remember the singles were the same as the album versions. On track 9- You are my love, I hear a fluctuation from 40-42 seconds. Might be I got a bad cd or the tape when they remastered it.  If anyone who buys the 2012 version of the cd has the same problem post it here in the comments.<br />More pictures and liner note then original cd release.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|(see title) jk.i really enjoyed this game. i could play this game for hours. super simple and super fun! best app!
0824835921|5.0|This book is amazing at helping me remember the meanings to the kanji. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn kanji. The method is fun to use and the stories for the characters help me remember the kanji that I am studying without having to write the characters even once. Heisig's method to remembering the kanji is the best method, in my opinion. I'm so going to get the second one!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is cool. entertaining when you have a long ride or just hanging out. I recommend it. its great for young children also
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft so much! I play it with my friends and we make all sorts of crazy statues and homes! :) Definitely a great time killer! This is a must buy!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game...it is exactly what I want in a time waster!  good brain teased for kids of all ages.
B008KEQM3W|1.0|I ordered this thinking I was being clever being one of the first in the UK to have the blu ray of this film when it arrived I was so happy I wanted to see it while it was in the cinema put couldn't has I was 8 months pregnant and cinema not the most comfortableist place... I put it in my blu ray player and it told me I couldn't watch it due to the region it was an American copy and couldn't be played over here. Now I think if that's the case it should have said somewhere that that copy couldn't be watched in the UK. Really not impressed
B008673ZAQ|5.0|this 2nd book was much better than the first, the 1st book was way too much like 50 Shades of Grey. Now we're getting into a better storyline of the characters, and all ready looking forward to the 3rd book !!!
B008H6GH8I|4.0|This is so far the best CGI animated movie in Resident Evil series. Compared to ''Degenretaion'' it is so much better. I could not finish ''Degeneration'', but this movie has all the rights and no wrongs. Good story; very good animation and graphics; not too predictable; characters are given life, they don't feel that animated. Even when seeing Nemesis (which I saw like a real hardcore bad*ss), I felt like I was Leon himself and wanted just to run for my life. Besides that the movie is almost 2 hours long and quite often I felt like cinematics will end any moment and I will have to shoot BOWs. As the movie takes place right before Resident Evil 6, I wonder what will the game deliver. Will it be as enjoyable to play as seeing this animated movie? I hope.<br /><br />Plot:<br />U.S. federal agent Leon S. Kennedy sneaks into the \\"East Slavic Republic\\" to verify rumors that Bio-Organic Weapons (BOWs) are being used in the country's civil war, which the U.S. and Russia are making preparations to jointly intervene in. Right after his infiltration, the U.S. government orders him to leave immediately. Determined to uncover the truth, Leon ignores the order and enters the battlefield to end the chain of tragedies caused by the BOWs.
0143121421|5.0|[[ASIN:0802714544 The Spy Who Came in From the Cold]]<br /><br />I got to know Le Carre only recently through his later novels, which were not quite exciting. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold totally changed things, more interesting than most crime fiction titles. The book helps to revive memories of  the past associated with the cold war which held back global development. The unusual introduction by Le Carre himself is great.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I dont understand why people assume, all animated movies are kids movies. This movie lies on an amazing concept with very standard comic scenes. Jack's voice is so clear and amazing. Agree this is not a movie for kids but have to give some credits for the makers for keeping the adults happy with an animated movie
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|If you like Mumford & Son's first album, you will love this one more. They bring a really fresh, folky sound to today music.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is action packed. you will love every second so you better read this if you love percy jackson books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual Jack Reacher novels are always exciting. Action packed and non stop. Lee Child needs to continue on this series.
B008M9PHWM|2.0|If it wasn't for the backing band this would have nothing to recommend it. I love that Dylan releases new music on vinyl for audiophiles who may have never gone digital, but other than the last song, this had little I havn't heard already.
B008ZD4WN0|5.0|Top Notch CD Quality . This cd could only be better if audio fidelity could re-master the cd  in partnership with the band!!!!
B001FW58D6|5.0|I LOVE this series and I'm totally addicted to it.  And to think, I just finished the first season and have 4 more to go with at least 20 episodes in each.  Now I have something great to watch instead of the poor shows that are on this year.  It's a mixture of drama, horror, science fiction and can be very funny at times.  Walter Bishop is a riot.  It's full of surprises and has made me jump out of my chair more than once, made me laugh, made me horrified.  If you're squeamish don't watch it.  It's realy well done and well acted.  I'm thrilled I found it.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I am truly captivated by this entire series.  I was always a Greek and Roman mythology addict when I was in this age group and can't thank this author enough for making it not only interesting but wow, FUN to read.  I can't wait until my kids are old enough to read the series (they are 6 now).<br /><br />On to the Mark of Athena... I was drawn in by the second chapter, and held captive (hard to do with 4 little ones running around) for the book's entirety.  I personally dislike cliff endings.  I am a sucker for closure of SOME sort.  This time there was virtually no closure, merely a lot of escalation I found the solution minimal, it needed to be more to offset the ending.<br /><br />Now I have to wait a year for the next chapter, NOT Fun.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I think this is an excellent follow up album to \\"Sigh No More\\".  I can't get enough of it and keep hitting repeart on my iPod.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is so awesome . It is very cooler than any game I love it so much I wish I could be in it.
0446547573|5.0|I am still reading this book, but it has been a great read since i started, can hardly put the book down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is awesome<br />I made a city on the game I found diamonds and gold so I can make a house out of it I have it on my phone and I made a big house
B0051OJG4Q|1.0|Okay, so it's 'great value' for bargain hunters, but to me, it's totally without value, and indeed, a sham product, when albums are promised as 'digitally remastered' and turn out to be TAKEN STRAIGHT OFF VINYL, complete with audible needle-in-groove sound, pops and clicks. One of the reviewers here denies this: he's wrong. Admittedly, my Martin Logan speakers are very revealing, but they reveal the TRUTH. Rip-off.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|book is written in \\"regular language\\" depth of detail is  excellent; characters are very defined in terms of personality; plot in totally intriguing and believable. descriptions of all characters and personalities very defined and on point which adds to the suspense.  One of the very best novels I have read in a very long time; simply could not put it down for an hour; read it straight through and stayed up very, very late doing so.  Would higly recommend to any avid reader who loves the \\"real mysteries of todays coulture with reality in tact.  Best of all.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|What can I say, I am the Eminem fan who knows all the songs, every lyric and every rhyme, I own his books and have followed him since I was 12 years old.<br /><br />This is his best CD.  He has grown leaps and bounds, and talks about things that matter in life, rather than witty, violent rhymes.  Don't get me wrong, I love his style, I love his controversial lyrics, and I feel every word he says.  But this CD takes it to a whole nother level than before.<br /><br />He's really grown up and it shows.  Proof being gone is a common theme, and how could it not be.  Going Through Changes has brought a tear to my eye before, thinking about the imagery of the song.<br /><br />I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I listen to it almost every single day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy to play. Very addicting. Every free moment I have, I play this game. Its a lot easier, cheaper, and more fun than going somewhere that has this game machine! And its even better that you don't have to fuss around to find quarters to play on the machine! he he!
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Love Eminem, and downloaded this CD from the internet to preview it.  I heard \\"Take from me\\" and immediately thought it was one of Eminem's best verses.  I felt like he was talking to me about stealing his music, thinking it won't mean anything.  I bought the album shortly after, and listen to it pretty much daily.<br /><br />take from me is easily the best song on the cd, with fast lane being #2
B007THA4FI|2.0|Slow moving. Bounces around. Rather boring. I read the Harry Potter series and truly enjoyed it. Based on the literary value of that series my wife and I purchased Casual Vacancy expecting the same level of fast paced intrigue. We are both reading the book and have both set it aside for now as it doesn't hold our interest.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great brain teaser. Worked perfectly on my Droid 2. Use this game to keep the thought process going.  The music was also great in the background.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Again it draws you in leaving you wanting more. Can't wait for the next one! Next fall can't come soon enough.
B0065AVS0K|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It had a good plot and the comic-book feel of the production worked well.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes their drama with a dark side.  If it helps you choose, I liked Sin City more than Watchmen and The Crow and much more than Dark City.  I group these 4 movies together because they are all trying to evoke the same sinister vibe with darkened sets.
B001C08RHA|5.0|An equal mix of drama and action to keep your attention throughout the entire movie.  Just fast paced enough so you will miss a couple things and want to look at it all over again without getting bored. You're just say, \\"Oh!\\"  Enjoy!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I wish there were more ways to get coins; they run out way too fast so have to wait to continue playing. Otherwise fun while you have coins to play with.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinning and I can spend hours on pinterest. when the app came out that just took my pinning to a whole other level, now I just can't stop pinning! love pinterest!!
159514188X|1.0|...to say how awful it is. The author can write. It is not a matter of skill. But a writer should stick to things they know or have researched extensively. And by research, I don't mean that they read a bunch of articles/stories and statistics on suicide. If this author actually did research the subject of suicide, I would be surprised. This is a very \\"Saved By The Bell,\\" approach to a devastating and tragic subject. There are not enough hours in the day to express my dislike of this story. It was one of the books that my child's (apparently) clueless teacher gave kids to choose from (out of 10 other books with a suicide topic).  If you are a superficial, shallow, \\"love reality TV\\" kind of person, you will probably enjoy this book tremendously. If you have any depth whatsoever and are in tune to how serious a subject this is, you may actually be offended by reading it.<br />  The following is not a spoiler because you learn right away that Hannah killed herself: The main character development is poor. As the story progresses, I do not get - at any point - how Hannah became suicidal. She seems like a strong individual, caring little for silly high school opinions. Then, suddenly, she sees suicide as her only option. I kept thinking, \\"Did I miss something?\\"<br />  No. The author did.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game, had me hooked the entire time.  Not to hard, but challenging at the same time.  recommend you play this game if you like puzzles.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Excellent lesson on learning to strategize, well disguised in an adventure story. Should be a must-read for gamers, especially war-gamers.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Hey everyone, i just wanted to tell you minecraft 6.0 is awaiting aproval! mult might get better! It will be so much fun!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game but it's not one that I would play for more then 15-20. Min.s at a time. Your game runs out of coins pretty fast and the game is over unless you spend real money to buy more coins.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app used to be a great for downloading music to my kindle... used to be.. a couple months after I had it, it would refuse to let me download or even view the video! Now it doesn't even work it closes everytime I try to use it :(
1607066017|5.0|I was dying waiting for the trade to come out. I love this! Highly recommend this one to anyone that loves sci-fi/fantasy genres.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Please don't switch the board around when in two player mode; it's very confusing.  Other than that I'm quite pleased.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|amazing story, superb acting, best director,hard to watch at times, but leaves you with a little hope of humanity...I can see why a Gold Globe and an Oscar
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The charecters are amazing.. I love this story! I hadnt read any of her books until a friend recommended her books..Im so happy with her books. I cant wait for book 3! Keep up the great work!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have this app on my ipod. I was very happy to see it available for my kindle. its a nice way to relax at the end of a long day.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Alot like Fifty Shades, could'nt put it down. Both of the main characters are fifty shades of messed up..  I love the supporting characters more than those of fifty shades.  The story works well for all of them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Written very well, gets to the point,this I found easy to follow and did not want to put it down, cannot wait for the third book of this series.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Pointless, mindless, and a waste of time.  It's just the thing when I have a few minutes to kill!!  Running out of coins keeps it from becoming addictive.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Not too shabby, better than most matching games. Plays sort of like bejeweled but it has other mechanics to make it more challenging
B0040JHL4K|5.0|Brooks Running Shoe. There is no negative to these shoes, they are built for performance. Brooks is customer driven, their customers develop the products by testing and feedback during the process. Then the produce a quality product!
B0058O84G0|5.0|A very interesting historical novel centered on the power struggles preceding, during and after WW one.  The main characters are very believable and their own places in life at that time is detailed and interesting.  Cannot wait to read the second book in this trilogy.  Excellent reading for those interested in historical  novels.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the platform &amp; evernote sisters apps (skitch). upgrade to premium if you upload lots of photos like I do! quick uploads &amp; works across droid vs. Mac gap!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|..  loving the fifty shades a should read for all men & women..<br />wish this book was the copie of my journal..errotic and funny, Love Ana's humor and sarkasum.
B0053O89YM|5.0|As always, the cast of \\"The Good Wife\\" season three, is great! The best show on TV, adult, witty, sexy!
B008BIN9EW|1.0|I got this game when it was the faotd and it worked fine. Upgraded my memory card to 32Gb and went to download the game again and now it says incompatible and refuses to let me download it again. Until I can redownload and play this game, you will only get one star from me. I am on the HTC Evo 3D and I am running ICS.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book. I've never read a book as erotic as this before. Very interesting! Will read book 2 and 3 for sure.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really liked this 2nd edition of the Crossfire novel.  It gave alot of background infomation on Gideon and Eva's past. I took one star off because there wasn't as much \\"smut\\" as the first one.  That was part of the charm. Lol. Nice and easy read. Can't wait for the third book!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really enjoyed this series and can't wait for more. The concept of the book is very unique, and the characters are really interesting. Over all its a clean read although there is one villian who curses quite a bit. Not sure that his foul language really lent anything to the story (my only complaint).
B000002HEP|5.0|All the cds i bought are fabulous, \\"SKY VALLEY\\" is one of those! I'm happy 'cause the four Kyuss cd's I bought arrived without problems!<br /><br />I LOVE KYUSS!

B008673ZAQ|4.0|#2 not quite as enticing as the first, but rarely is.  So relieved that the end did not leave me gaping since #3 is nowhere in sight. Drawn out cliffhangers just tick me off. Yeah, I'm a now person!
0525478817|4.0|I bought this book based on the fact the I watch John Green on youtube. The book was pretty good. I'm not much of a novel reader but I actualy got into this book.
B005OJTVMK|4.0|It is a good solid cover that has served its purpose very well so far.  The closing tab has a magnetic back on it so it keeeps it closed.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|is okay. maybe get more points when you replay a game after you beat because its hard to try points after you spend them
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fabulous book but was a bit disappointed by the ending. Kept me on edge all the way up until the end.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Has great features and the best picture quality I'll never regret buying this product if you like star trek than this is for you, not only does it have the original picture but the enhanced picture episodes that they play on t.v. Just buy it trust me
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Gripping!  The penultimate of scene \\"rips your heart out.\\"  Hard to imagine the psychological trauma for the \\"fiance.\\"  A very good personalization of the many tragedies that occurred because of the desire to prove Aryan superiority during the Nazi regime of the 1930's.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I read some of this but to be honest I'm not converted by it!  I have heard that if you cut out wheat completely that it is very hard to put it back into your diet.  I read the first few pages, flicked through a bit and never picked it back up again.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very well polished Match 3 game with a well integrated fun story, many excellent levels, great music, and loads of fun.  I was hooked pretty much instantly.  I'm not usually into the run of the mill match 3 games but building a compelling story into it makes all the difference.  The graphics are just beautifully drawn.
0099580578|5.0|Read these books from a recommendation from MANY friends. I can now RECOMMEND them to you! Pick up your copies today, hard to put down once you start!!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book was written for me.  I am sure many others are saying the same thing.  My spiritual walk and search have been continuing my whole adult life.  This book crystalizes a new understanding for my that makes sense.  It makes spiritual growth and clarity possible and understandable.  What more could anybody want!
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|BUYER BEWARE!  The DVD included in this set DOES NOT included the Deleted Scenes and Bonus Features.  They are only included on the Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />I bought this set because one day I hope to upgrade to a blu-ray player.  After opening the product, I realized that I won't be able to watch any of the bonus material.  What a waste!<br /><br />Great Movie, no question, but don't buy this package unless you have a blu-ray player!<br /><br />Signed: very unhappy customer.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|One of Bob Dylan's EXCELLENT cd's as he only can do. Will be one of his best work's  , great , what else can You say.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Even though this is obviously a filler book in the Heroes of Olympus series. I was very much a fan of all of it.  I felt it did move the story forward from where we left off in the previous book and did see some character development take place.  I would've liked more interactions with the pantheon, as I feel as though thats where these books shine, however I do understand the lack thereof.<br /><br />In short, if you're a fan of the series check it out.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I don't do much editing on mobile devices, but the one thing I do that's important to me is fill in my timecard for work which is a macro-enabled spreadsheet. The problem is that every time I enter a time in one of the shift time boxes, this app automatically adds \\"1/1/70\\" before the time (e.g. 1/1/70 6:18:00 AM). Quick Office Pro does not do this.<br />I have contacted support about this, and even sent them an example of the document as they requested, and their answer was to download the update. When I told them that after the update it is still doing the same thing, I never got a response again.<br />Also, it removes any vertical text properties from the spreadsheet, as well as the print mode (i.e. changes it from landscape to portrait).<br />Finally, it doesn't retain my Sugar Sync password. I have to enter it every time (unless I open the file from the Sugar Sync app).<br />I definitely like Quick Office Pro better; especially the way I can just double tap one of the time boxes and it pops up a time window similar to the one you get when setting an alarm on the phone. I wish OSP had this capability.<br />So why don't I just use QOP? Because that app has a flaw bigger than any of the OSP flaws. Quite often after editing a file, I go to save it and a box pops up saying \\"Unable to Save File\\". This happens on several different devices, and on 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi. Even if I select \\"Save As\\" or even clear the app's cache. Makes no difference.
0545265355|5.0|Loved the books. I had previously read them on my kindle but bought the hardcovers for my stepdad to read and in order to add them to my favorite books collection. Great quality books. Great story. & Great price! :]
B002KGKH5A|5.0|I personally love the documentaries that follow behind the band as they are walking from back house towards the main stage. This film can indeed be placed with the classics: Bob Dylan's \\"Don't Look Back\\" to Radiohead's \\"Meeting People Is Easy\\". I wish I could figure out exactly why Meg White is crying at the end...
0345529057|4.0|So I was a little hesitant to order this set at first due to the not so great reviews this product had received. When I opened my Amazon package I noticed that the SEALED package contained the books in a random order. I right away thought \\"Oh no! The reviews are true!\\" Luckily they weren't. The next thing I did was make sure that all the books contained the page numbers in a proper order since many reviews had complaints about that. I was happy to see that everything appeared to be properly numbered. I am still on book 1, taking my time to enjoy the book and so far so good. I will definitely update if I notice something out of order. I believe most of the negative reviews stemmed from when the set initially came out and could of simply been due to a publisher issue. Anyways, I really only had a little pet peeve and would have to agree with some reviewers, hence the 4 stars, about the binding. I believe I care well for my books but really I usually buy hardcovers (which obviously have a longer wear and tear). However, you can definitely tell that the glue they used is not the best, I haven't had any pages falling out or anything yet but I can see the book is starting to form that gap where it is getting loose. I would just recommend being very careful with this book.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very engaging. Couldn‘t put it down. Easy read. Fun journey! Love the Erie feeling of the town. Free with prime!
B008G8SFGO|1.0|ok first, never listen to this album before and I won't. this is not kiss people. I've been a fan since I was 8 years old from Alive II. I have every album, kissology and the ones I've made. I was one of those kids who bought their bubble gum cards. You got 2 people pretending to be the other two....ace and Peter. at least Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent had their own makeup. but paying someone to be ace and Peter is crap. sorry gene but its the truth. it just saddens me to see what Kiss became. I've seen them few times in the 80s and the reunion tour which I was ecstatic bout. being a kiss fan since 1977, this was my chance to see something my age wouldn't allow me do....and they kicked ass. but all these years....it's turned into a Vegas tribute band. time to retire the name boys or take the makeup off. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.
B006QANR5I|5.0|Christmas at Downtown Abbey has not been broadcasted in France at the end of season 2 and this is a pity. This DVD bridges the gap with season 3 and allows to discover Bates' fate as well as the outcoming of Mary's and Matthew's love.A great moment indeed. Very fast and reliable delivery.
B003EH2WN4|5.0|Very impressed with the acting, subject matter etc.<br />... please watch! I wish.. this series would never end, I'm on Season 4 now, Pre-ordered Season 5...
B009ANAQ4S|4.0|Expectations are always high for a new Morrison recording. This man's voice is comforting for some quirky reason.<br />Born to Sing is no exception to the pattern. I love the poetry. I, for one, am glad there was no plan B.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the ones at the fair.  still not the same but much cheaper.  wondering what happens after u collect all the prizes
B005LAII1C|5.0|Absolutely historical. I f you can not see the humor and wit in this movie then you should truly check to see if you still have a pulse. I cried from laughter! It was funny from start to finish!!!!!
B009329ZF2|5.0|Best family, action, USA feel-good movie of 2012!! Some swearing, but they avoid actual use of the \\"f\\" word :) Great USA movie
0399157565|1.0|Used to be I couldn't wait to get my hands on another Kay Scarpetta novel.  Seems to me, since the miraculous bringing of Wesley Benton \\"back to life\\", I have been dissapointed with these novels.  You have to be a forensic specialist to understand what \\"Kay\\" is saying or thinking most of the time.  And, aren't you supposed to root for the main, return characters?  I have found over the years that I don't feel that way.  I don't think anyone would let their child, much less their niece, act and treat them the way Lucy does her Aunt Kay.  And if it's so painful for Kay to remember what Marino did to her all those years ago, why would she keep him on her staff?  These things make no sense to me.  To me, it's like a sitcom that should have ended years ago because it isn't funny anymore, I think maybe it's time to retire Kay Scarpetta.  These books are no longer entertaining and page turning to me, they are creepy, hard to understand (in fact I find myself rereading page after page to try and figure out what it means)and I wish I hand't wasted this much money on this book - I could have found another murder mystery that would make me anxious to sit down and finish, not feeling like this one does.  I'm left feeling like Kay Scarpetta is not the character I knew and loved, and Lucy and Morino should have been kicked to the curb years ago.  If you liked the original Scarpetta/Marino novels, you will most likey not like this one at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is great and there is creative mode and it is fun to play survival over all it is worth the money to get it
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is very entertaining. It is easy to learn and fun to play. The free app. makes it an awesome choice for your kindle fire.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|David Gilmour is my favorite Pink Floyd member, because, for me at least, his music style is more developed than Roger Waters's. Pink Floyd's The Wall and Final Cut albums really show Roger's music style, which the songs don't really stay the same...they change about half way through into a whole another track. And David is another reason why I like him so much: He kept Pink Floyd going by two albums and didn't let Roger Waters get his way. Now, I'm not putting Roger down completely, he did help Pink Floyd's career, but I was disappointed in him when he became such a control freak. Nevertheless, I'm talking about David here, because he does really shine through this album.<br /><br />The record of his first solo was recorded in late '77 to '78. Roger Waters didn't let David do too much for Pink Floyd's Animals album other than write Dogs and let him sing half way through and help compose the music for the album. Both David and Richard Wright recorded their solo albums about the same time, both sold poorly because I think everybody feared Pink Floyd was about to split up, and in some ways Pink Floyd did split up...musically and lyrically.<br /><br />Now let me talk about Gilmour's album. This album is a killer, in a good way! Like I said, David really shine in this album. It really shows his guitar skills, his own lyrics, his own style of music, but of course he can't totally escape from Pink Floyd's music. However, this album is fun listening to, it's rocky, it's enjoyable, and it will make bow your head along with the music.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Mihalis.\\" This is actually an instrumental, but still good enough to listen. It opens up with a nice and calm guitar, but as the song progresses through, the guitar becomes harder, and the song goes a little faster.<br /><br />\\"There's No Way Out of Here\\" has a Western like guitar. Yes, I said Western, that's really the only way I could describe the tone of the guitar for this song. David actually recorded this song in `75, but it didn't find its way in a Pink Floyd album. And David used the girls for the special closing.<br /><br />\\"Cry from the Street\\" is a bluesy but very deep rock and roll song. It's a little heavier than the first two tracks , and the lyrics for this song shows how David can be a very good lyricist by himself. And he has a surprise for us at the end of the song.<br /><br />\\"So Far Away\\" is my personal favorite on this album. It shows that David could play another instrument other than a guitar...a piano. This is a calm and slow piano song with a nice touch of the girls' voices. David also delivers a calm guitar solo, and his lyrics do stand out in this song.<br /><br />\\"Short and Sweet\\" isn't short and sweet song. It's co written with Roy Harper, who gave his performance in Floyd's \\"Have a Cigar.\\" It's hard to follow the lyrics, because there's another person that sings a long with David, but this song does have some powerful guitar moments.<br /><br />\\"Raise My Rent\\" is a very eerie instrumental with a guitar tone that sounds a little bit of Metallica's guitarist Kirk...did I really just wrote that? Yes, David's guitar in this song does have Kirk's guitar tone, even when Kirk wasn't famous just yet.<br /><br />\\"No Way\\" is more an edgy rock, and this is my other personal favorite track. The lyrics sounds more like he was angry with Roger for not letting him do his own parts for Floyd's Animals album.<br /><br />\\"Deafinitely\\" (not definitely) is another rocky instrumental that some parts are loud, and David likes to change the volume down and let it slowly rise back up here and there. It's heavy with bass, and it has a lot of more guitar effects.<br /><br />\\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\" really closes the album brilliantly. The first part of this song is slow while David is singing the lyrics. It also has a touch of an acoustic guitar, which this is the only song that has an acoustic. And just when you thought it was over...David delivers the closing ofthis song with hard guitars and powerful music.<br /><br />This, I think, is really the best David Gilmour's solo album. His solo album really has that sound between Floyd's Animals and The Wall. So if you're looking for that sound, look no further. You ought to give Gilmour a try.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is  a wonderful story  teller.  She shares such vivid details and her characters are rich and  full of life.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Honestly I didn't think this movie would have been very good. Seriously it kept my attention and left me wanting more. Normally alien movies aren't my favorite thing, but this one was worth buying after I rented it (which says a lot around my house).
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I highly recommend this to everyone. This is an amazing book that really gives you a different perspective on life :)
B009NQKPUW|1.0|My title says it all. I was bored and a family member wanted to watch it. We both agreed to turn it off since it was catching our attention.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have waited for 4 years for those two to get together.<br />I hope ABC will allow them to continue in a wonderful<br />relationship for as long as the series lasts (hopefully for<br />many more years).<br />My wife and I enjoyed the program and didn't miss any of<br />the episodes. Patty passed away in 2010 and didn't get to<br />see the two of them get together but I know she would have<br />cried with joy because we were really invested in the<br />series. Unlike most programs on now days we didn't have<br />much interest in them but Castle and Becket reminded us<br />of each other so many years ago. We were married 40 years<br />and I hope ABC will give Becket and Castle a long and<br />happy lifetime together.<br /><br />Not much of a review on the technical stuff most people<br />like to talk about. There's just so little on tv that is worth<br />watching but this series is a wonderful change to the<br />rest of the stuff that comes out of Hollywood.<br /><br />Keep it up ABC. It's the only series I watch on that network.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in you was a long awaited read for me! I loved Bared to you and cannot wait for the next book. Sylvia Day kept me wanting more and more. . . well you get the idea. If you liked 50 shades, read this series!
B005K17RU0|4.0|simply works. you will like on kindle fire. could use a more detailed daily forecast. miss the hourly forecast on intellicast.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I do not write many reviews on Amazon, but this album is absolutely amazing. Not a single track should be skipped. Buy it!<br />5 stars for the album.<br />1 stars for Amazon's  \\"words\\" counter.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|Bluesy, compelling, moody. I've been a \\"Van Fan\\" for decades and this is as good as anything he's done in the past 20 years. You won't go wrong with this one.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game love it just like on facebook. but.... there should be an easy way to get the gems besides paying for them
0062202081|5.0|IT GOT TO MY HOUSE REALLY FAST!  I WAS SURPRISE  THAT I GOT IT REALLY FAST! CAN'T WAIT TO SHOP AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ITEM !
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved the way  the problems feel so real, and they are. It's a huge issue that a lot of people are afraid to talk about. Very well written and emotional.
B007THA4FI|2.0|As one who spent countless nights perched at the bedside with my children reading the HP series...it was a nighttime ritual at our house...I couldn't wait to order the book on my Kindle and rabidly opened it immediately. It was extremely difficult to follow the characters who seemed quite two dimensional, difficult to maneuver much of the UK vernacular. I finally just put it down and shook my head. JK Rowling is such a gifted writer. But I am wondering if her editors and publishers were frank with her about this book...or just looking at the $$$.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers is an outstanding move that is excellent for the whole family. They have seens that are directed to childern and adults. It was an excellent down load.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I was excited to start this trilogy as I have been a long time fan of Ken Follett. I thought it was enticing from the first pages. I was a little concerned about keeping all the characters straight but Ken Follett does a good job of spending enough time on each so it's not an issue. I did find part of the sections about the Russian govt a bit tedious towards the last quarter of the book but it was detailed.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Adults and kids alike in our household enjoyed this movie. And the quality of Amazon's video was excellent. HD worked perfectly.
1416594795|5.0|The book on tape kept me awake for 15 hours of driving. Dawkins summarizes all aspects of scientific research that seamlessly fits together to support the theory of evolution, and explains why theory is a problematic word to creationist and intelligent design advocates.  He is a little hard on them at times - but really, c'mon. Science and religion are two different things, like apples and oranges. Or emus and manatees.
019272004X|5.0|I bought this for my daughters literature class. Although not a book she would pick on her own, she took to this classic right away. Sherlock Holmes is one of those protagonists that will captivate readers forever.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book ended with tears in my eyes. The beginning of the book began with tears in my eyes. I have never read a book that kept me laughing and smiling and crying all at the same time. I don't know maybe if I can relate to the whole losing someone with all your heart thing, or if it is because of that feeling of loving someone with all your heart. Lake sure had a struggle, and I am so glad that there was a guy like Will to keep her even the entire novel. I cannot wait to see what Point of Retreat brings to the table!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|As a huge Green Day fan I was very anxious to get this CD and I was not dissapointed. Great music and I love Oh Love. Cant wait for the next two CDs to come out. Keep em' coming guys!! I love you Billie Joe <3 :-)
B003JBHQP4|5.0|Wow. Talk about exceeding expectations. It looks polished and has the Amazon logo, not like Chinese junk. It even comes in a nice box. Maybe I'm too easily impressed. I got it to read Smart Media (SM) cards from a ten year old Olympus camera. It worked after a little fiddling. Oddly, my antivirus (AVG) shows an alert on C:\autorun.inf every time I plug the card reader into a USB jack. There is no such file on either drive, so I tell it to ignore.
B006LSZECO|1.0|i bought this book solely because my friends talked me into it, they told me how good it was.  boy, was i disappointed. from the first page i could tell it wasnt gonna be good but kept reading in hopes it would get better, well half way through i stopped reading, just couldnt get into it, too slow a read,not suspenseful, i actually hated it.
0345477618|5.0|As the title reads: this is the DEFINITIVE story behind the original film.<br /><br />Really absorving reading and with a lot of unseen photos.
B001O03NCW|5.0|I really loved Oh Brother Where Art Thou?  besides being a very entertainingly funny movie, the music was more than amazing.
0142410705|2.0|I can say with such abundant honesty that it hurts, that this book is nothing short of literary trash. First off, the premise is, quite frankly, retarded. Some supposed former child-prodigdy thinks that he can make such a complicated algorithm, one that would require an innumerable amount of variables to consider, only to come to the inevitable conclusion that he can't. Big surprise. Honestly, I don't understand how this book is given anything other than a passing mention amongst any community. It's also written in a style that's reminiscent of a 40 year old man trying to write \\"hip\\" and be \\"in with the kids.\\" It's patronizing drivel. I hate everything about this book, and I honestly would rather eat dog feces than re-read this garbage. John Green can take a big one, and he should, for producing such terrible material. - Ian.
B003O86FMW|4.0|But not as good as the first.  I still enjoyed it and it was entertaining but dragged in certain areas.  i would still recommend this book and i am anxious to see how this story ends.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This book is amazing. I read it in school and I usually hate the books we read but this book is truly amazing. I loved every word of it. It is funny, sad, and intense all at the same time. This book may seem big and intimidating but it is a fast read and definately worth the buy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. So easy to use. Love this app. So easy to use. Love this app. So easy to use.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I thinks this was a good edtion to the heros of olympus but it did not blow me a way like some of the others have i give it 4 start for it edge of ur seat story but not quite a five because there was not as many unseen twist as in some of his other work
B006VGGAC4|1.0|total waste of money , time, a very boring book and a waste of space on my e reader can I get my money back.. Full of fluff and nothing else.. If you must read it  get it free from your library or  better yet wait until it ends up at your nearest dollar store...
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Loved this movie ever since I was a kid, was thrilled to find it on BluRay. Service was fast, everything I expected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy the game.....it's addictive. Definitely a good distraction during long boring meetings.  Getting up to the higher levels has been a great challenge.  very fun!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book because it kept showing up on several reading lists.  My title says it all... these characters are twisted and flawed  and totally engrossing.  I could not put this book down because I wanted to see how it all turned out. Some parts were unbelievable and just did not like the fact that Amy came across like she was invincible and infallible.  Also left questioning whether one part of book was real or one of Amy's lies.  Like other reviewers, I totally hated the ending
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Pleasant fairy tale.  Morgenstern is very skilled in creating the mysterious atmosphere of the Cirque de Reves.  Remarkably nothing really happens in this atmosphere driven novel, and the plot seems too much like an young adult romance/fantasy for my taste.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book in the Crossfire serious is even better than the first! For those of you looking for a next read after Fifty, I highly recommend this series!  Can't wait for the last book to come out! December 31st!!!
0307987698|4.0|This book is colorful and easy to read.  It is a Christmas present for my 3 1/2 yo granddaughter.  We have not read it yet, but I am sure she will like it and enjoy it.  That is all I can say for now.  Thank you.
159413586X|5.0|Mockingjay is the third book in the trilogy of The Huger Games and Catching Fire series. We are taken to District 13 with Katniss, Gale and Haymitch, where she meets the people of District 13. Katniss is given the opportunity to become the \\"Mockingjay\\" the symbol of the resistence to the Capital. This book has it all - romance, exciting action and intrigue. Not everyone makes it out alive, because after all it is war. But the ending is satisfactory. It's a quick read, and I'm sorry that there are not more books like this one. I enjoyed it and give it 5 out of 5 stars.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book. Started right where the first book left off. This book left me on the edge of my seat wondering what in the heck was going on. Starting the 9th chapter I couldn't put it down till it was over
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Now this is a movie I truly enjoyed! I found it to be very original, somewhat disturbing but kept my interest every step of the way! If you're looking for something different with great performances and like a little surprise twist, then this movie is for you!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|So many fantasy novels now make use of the physics theory in which any point of decision, also takes place in an alternate universe in reverse.  String theory certainly does provide any number of fictional plots.  But King uses it with underhanded finesse.  This book is about time travel and he certainly addresses the reverberations of changing the past.  But king is able to slip in another undertext of the danger of time travel.  I liked this book.  King is a popular and accessible writer, but it doesn't mean he can't wite a nuanced book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this version of minecraft is in need of updates. the review. this game has the same blockly texature and same creapers. the fun in this game is a lot to behold. I think this game oz well worth the money and better than antithetic version like block story. this was oringaly more updated than xbox but now it isn't. it needs more before you can call a full fledged minecraft. this app plays the same on all tablets. but is best on the fire
B004LROUW2|5.0|I love this author.  As I have written before,  a book that can take me to new place is one I treasure.  Murakami is a writer with whom one can only sign up for the long run and relax.  The winding detail is very much the point.  Add this to the fact that the premise teases the fact that this is almost familiar.  As our character travels to an alternate, but very very similar world to our own, the reader pauses with her to ponder if she has in fact slipped into IQ  84.<br />How often do we snap to attention and wonder how we got here?  There is a nagging feeling that something is off.  Now it rarely happens after climbing down a service ladder from a Tokyo gridlock, but then that is one of the charms of the novel.  I can almost see myself panicking in a gridlock on the way to the appointment of my life, and running off.  The charm is that our heroine does run, and takes us where the world has changed.  A very worthy trip.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Been waiting for this book to come out- and boy! was it worth the wait! The only thing is-I read it so fast and now I have to wait until January for the next book to come out! I need more Gideon in my life! :-) This book id definitely a must read! Enjoy!
B007THA4FI|3.0|The writing is beautiful and insightful.  Unfortunately, we don't care about any of the characters in this seedy story and without a protagonist it is hard to find a reason to pick the book back up and finish it.  Harry Potter readers, don't bother buying it.  If you like well written books about how pathetic people are, you'll definitely want to pick this up.
B001R0LOES|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. Passionate, energetic, compelling, and tragic. The script crackles along with wit and pathos, the acting is superlative (esp. Neeson, who, I read, waited some 10 years to play the part while Jordan wrote the script and chased funding), the directing outstanding. Truly magnificent.<br /><br />The historical era it covers is a tough one, not least for an Irishman like myself - the birth of the IRA, the guerrilla army of the Irish Republic which had been declared at the Easter rising of 1916 (with which the film opens). Despite that rising's failure, the survivors continued to behave as if the Republic was a reality and when, in the 1918 elections, the Irish people overwhelmingly endorsed the Republic, the elected officials refused to go to London, but formed a secessionist government in Ireland, complete with a Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Eamon De Valera, and a cabinet of ministers, including Collins. Collins was tasked with organizing the Republic's \\"army,\\" the IRA, to fight the inevitable British backlash. And so the War of Independence started.<br /><br />All of this is wonderfully portrayed in the film, though some of the complexities are glossed over, as they must be for a film. Collins is shown as the man he was, a brilliant organizer and leader, a master of counter-intelligence, and a ruthless opponent of British rule, but one who despised the lengths he was forced to go to fight the superior British Empire and bring it to its knees. A warrior who longed for peace. Stirring stuff.<br /><br />The most controversial aspect of the film is undoubtedly the Collins-De Valera relationship. Collins is depicted as fiercely loyal to \\"his chief,\\" but De Valera, himself a pedant and micromanager, is jealous of Collins' dashing style, the natural loyalty he evinces in others, and his growing popularity. So when the British offer to negotiate, De Valera sent Collins to lead the team - in the full knowledge that whoever was in that role would have toreturn with a compromise solution, since the British would never recognize the Republic outright.<br /><br />And so it turned out. After three months in London, where he cut a figure in society circles, Collins returned with a Treaty that De Valera instantly lead the charge to denounce. Pushing matters to the extreme, De Valera openly incited armed resistance to the pro-Treaty side, and a civil war ensued (1922-1923). Collins defended the treaty as giving Ireland \\"the freedom to achieve freedom,\\" while his purist opponents demanded the Republic be defended and fought for. Collins lost his life in that pointless war, and with him Ireland lost one of her most gifted sons.<br /><br />My father liked to tell me a story about Collins. My dad used to go up to Belfast for golf games with friends, many of whom were Protestants and fiercely Unionist (that is, they supported the Union of N. Ireland and Britain and opposed the Republic). One night, he said, after a few quiet pints after a game, one of these Unionist friends leaned over to my dad and said \\"I tell you, this would be a different country if Michael Collins had lived.\\" My father almost fell of his seat (not from the pints of Guinness). Here was a Unionist praising the former head of the IRA, the man who had led to the establishment of the Irish Republic (which was finally made official in 1937), which the Unionists opposed. My father asked how this could be and all his friend would say is \\"Great man, great man.\\"<br /><br />That is even some Unionists in the North of Ireland could see that Collins was a man of principle, a pragmatist, and a person they could deal with. The same could not be said for the pedantic, nit-picking and fiercely Catholic Eamon De Valera.<br /><br />The final quote in the film says it all: \\"It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will recognize the greatness of Michael Collins, and it will do so at my expense\\" - Eamon De Valera, 1966.
B0009P42S2|3.0|I bought Steamboy in the DVD bin at Dollar General for $2. It has a really great premise and some pretty good characters, but the final product is just ok. I'm not sure if this was a series, but it should have been. This is just like a lot of anime movies that are a crash course of a great longer series. Just like the \\"X\\" movie, the \\"Air\\" movie or the \\"Blue Gender\\" movie, it seems rushed and doesn't make a lot of sense. I was kind of disappointed. But if this is a series I imagine it could have some potential.
B000BXJ1U6|5.0|This movie is a great comedy classic!!!!!!!!  Everything about this movie is great from the acting, music, and settings just make this movie a masterpiece for comedy.  If you want a great laugh get this movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author is skillful. There are many twists and turns to throw you off the track. The  characters and the plot  became more and more complex. It held my interest right to the end.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Really interesting and well written book. One of the most motivational books to get get and run that I have read.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|I'm biased as I have been an avid Toy Story fan since my youth and now that my toddler enjoys the trilogy I get to relive these wonderful moments with him through the awesome humor and child friendly story line that keeps adults engaged and not ripping out their hair when watching it over and over! That's pretty hard to accomplish with any kids movie in my opinion and Pixar always does a wonderful job. In my<br />Opinion that is. Enjoy!
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|I want my money back. turned a word doc into useless Pdf.  what are they thinking? completely useless. I will say it again.
1609613937|5.0|Great book by a doctor who knows what he is talking about.  This book presents a safe and practial way to lose weight that really works.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just as good as the first one!!! Very disappointed the 3rd book is going to be SO late.....Tho I can't wait for it!!! This is as good if not better then another trilogy I've read!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The story line was ok.  I liked the mystery of background information on Gideon & Eva but I hated the relationship between them.  I understand it was supossed to be a dom/sub relationship but seriously, can this strong of a woman be that nieve that her boyfriend is a complete ASS!!  I didn't like Gideon at all, he was too bosy, very rude to Eva, made her very dependent on him and had her followed & spied on constently!  It drove me nuts!  It was a huge turn off for me.  They would have a terrible fight only to have quick make-up sex then act like everything was fine.  They never actually discussed their problems or resolve any of them and believe me, they had plenty.  It was like sex was their only relationship.  This is supossed to be erotic sex...to me the sex was so boring I skipped over half of the sex scenes.  Definitely not worth the 9.99 I paid.  I was dissapointed.
030746363X|5.0|First, the title of this book comes from the HIT workout Tim has devised, not the diet which is purely a fat loss diet and not a permanent lifestyle diet. For me, the book worked: 1) Because I was ready to do something about my condition. 2) Because I am a guy and the book is geared toward guys. 3) The book covered a lot more than dieting, it covers HIT training and supplements as well. The book borrows, consolidates, gives examples and uses common sense as well. It was the right mix for me. And no, I did not feel Tim Ferris was on an ego trip like some others seem to believe. In fact, he openly admits to being a nerdy non-athlete like most of us average men.<br /><br />There are lots of low carb options for dieting. This one is fairly strict and keeps things fairly simple. In addition to cutting out the usual high-carb suspects it cuts out dairy and fruit. But it gives you CHEAT DAY. For me, cheat day is huge. It not only functions as a reward and gives weekly incentive, it also makes scientific sense. Once a week, I remind my body that we are not in the middle of a famine and that it is OK to jettison excess fat. And I get to drink BEER on cheat day.<br /><br />The result for me is that from a high of 187 pounds, I am now 159 (I am 5' 9\\")and still dropping. This is my second stint on the diet. The first time I lost over 20 pounds. I then went back to a normal diet with some changes, such as cutting out the late night bindging and miscellaneous sweets. Beer drinking tends to pick up in the summer (and I REFUSE to drink crappy lite beer), but I never went above the mid 160's. This second stint I am trying to get rid of the love handles once and for all. As of today I was 159 after just two weeks.<br /><br />The best part of this book however is the workout. Last January I followed it and developed highly noticeable muscle definition gains in just about 6 weeks doing the workout and non-anabolic supplements such as HMB. I have slacked off a little since but plan to begin again now that I am losing more fat and definition will be even more noticeable.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention that I am 55 years old? And lazy? And was totally sedentary for most of the prior 10 years? Yes, the HIT workout Tim describes takes 4 HOURS A MONTH. Two 30 minute sessions a week. And it works. I looked better and felt better. And my wife says so too! So, I like the book. I now use it as a reference tool. It is minimalistic and written for the lazy man who wants the most gain for the least effort. I am totally up with that!egin again now that I am losing more fat and definition will be even more noticeable.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention that I am 55 years old? And lazy?

B007THA4FI|5.0|This was one of the most emotional reading experiences I can recall in a very long time. These characters became so real; flaws and all.  Each of their scenarios really reasonated and I found myself unable to put it down even though it was uncomfortable and almost unbearably sad at times.  I think this book is a contemporary masterpiece in the vein of the Harry Potter series but an entirely different subject matter.  sometimes it is possible to write a story that reflects real life and offers hope and light depite the darkness and Rowling achieved this in spades.  Read this book, reflect on it...you wont be disppointed.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Catchy tunes and lyrics with feeling. In other words... Maroon 5! I recommend this product for all fans of the band, or those looking for their first taste of M5. Personally, I discovered this album after enjoying their newest, \\"Overexposed.\\" I suggested \\"Songs About Jane\\" to two of my friends (who had never really listened to Maroon 5) and they loved it. So, five stars -- I can guarantee that this album won't disappoint.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|This game is way past cool once you play the first episode you will have to get the second. All the buddy moves added into episode 2 by tails are undeniably awesome flying and swimming( yes sonic has help underwater now) and super spin dashes you could hardly ask for more in a game. The playable metal sonic story is totally awesome for those of us who have been fortunate to have played sonic CD. Trust me sonic fans out there the price is worth it to see the two best buds(sonic and tails) back together again in this action packed game.
0545265355|5.0|Just like many others, I purchased this trilogy after being quite impressed by the movie, The Hunger Games. The box-set sat around my room for a while after coming out of the Amazon box, forgotten for about a week. When I finally cracked the cover of the first book, I violently fell into the world of Katniss Everdeen, lost in the shambles of District 12 and the horrors of the arena. I couldn't escape until all three books were thoroughly read. My only regret is how quickly the experience came and went; if Collins ever expands her series, I will be the first in line at the book store. Or better yet, I'll just pre-order on Amazon!<br /><br />The short version: If you liked the movie, you will love, love, love the books. The superiority of the latter is mind-blowing.
1878424114|5.0|this is a good book i like all of it i have not put the book down for a secn i like this book a lot thank you.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|My review of Avatar 3D is moreso about the 3D itself than about the storyline or acting etc., as a story it's only so so (good vs. evil/greed vs. purity etc.) and somewhat cheesy in a lot of ways as a result. As far as the acting, again, it was o.k. I enjoyed this movie much more as an experience, a visual and auditory action ride so to speak than as a \\"film\\" in any way. Many may disagree with my assesment in that regard however and that's ok.<br /><br />So, I Watched Avatar in 3D yesterday for the first time and honestly, I think the studio made a huge mistake having an exclusivity deal with Panasonic because if any 3D movie was ever going to get people to buy into the whole 3D thing, this movie would have been the one. Not that the 3D thing needed all that much help I guess as many people who bought newer HDTVs in the last couple of years were force fed one 3D technology or another (active/passive). In my case, I had no real interest in 3D but last year when I was in the market for a new HDTV, it seemed that all of my potential candidates had the technology built in so I was getting it whether I wanted it or not. For those reading this review and that are interested in knowing, the T.V. used to watch Avatar 3D was my Panasonic TC-P55VT30 (professionaly calibrated in February, 2012 by Kevin Miller) and the disc player used was my OPPO BDP-95. I own a few other 3D blu-rays such as Kung Fu Panda 2, HUGO, Alice in Wonderland, Lion King and a couple of others but Avatar easily beats them all in the 3D department in my opinion. Although initially I wasn't really interested in 3D, my new T.V. had the feature so naturally I picked up a few 3D discs to check it out. The ones I picked up were supposedly some of the best 3D discs out there in regards to picture quality and the use of the 3D tech so my expectations were pretty high. Each of those 3D movies was good in their own right to varying degrees but I was never totally blown away by the 3D in any of them. After watching them all, I was somewhat impressed by how far the tech had come and I did take notice of a few standout 3D scenes in each of them but overall I was left a little underwhelmed. That would lead me to wonder if they were even worth always watching in 3D or if watching the (usually included) standard blu-ray would be just as, if not more satisfying somehow. My issues with them all (the 3D effect that is) to one degree or another was that they don't always look as pin sharp as the standard, non 3D blu-ray and all of them exhibit some minor ghosting in several scenes which makes the image appear a little blurry at times. Some of the ghosting could possibly be attributed to my TV's handling of the 3D or the disc player's output of it to be sure but either way, while they were enjoyable enough in 3D, I just wasn't blown away. Unitl last night that is. Avatar was a near revalation in 3D compared to my other 3D discs. There was some minor ghosting in just a few scenes and not every single scene was razor sharp at all times but overall this movie had so many visually beautiful moments in 3D that it really made a very strong case for the 3D genre. There were many scenes that were in fact very sharp, clear and with standout depth and dimensiality. Avatar 3D has great colors, textures and it finally gave me that wow factor I was hoping for with my other 3D discs. The 3D in this movie really brought me further into the story and even nearly made me forget I was wearing those goofy glasses just to be able to enjoy it. I don't mean to make it seem as though those other 3D movies aren't good when it comes to the 3D effect in each of them, that's not the case. They are good and there are a couple of standout scenes in each of them but I just wasn't truly wowed by either of them. I was more like \\"Ok, that was cool, not bad\\". but I did enjoy them nonetheless so I would say that compared to Avatar 3D, they're very good but just not truly great. Avatar 3D, so far, is the best 3D disc out there right now in my opinion. I'm really hoping more 3D movies will have this level of 3D \\"rightness\\" because when it's done this well, it is very enjoyable and you can't imagine NOT watching the 3D version. I give the movie 5 stars for the 3D effect but only 2.5 (maybe 3 at best) stars for the storyline which I added up to the 4 stars I gave it overall. ENJOY!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I enjoyed the movie; it held my attention from beginning to end.  Wonderful story (I read the book before viewing the movie) I found that it followed the book quite well.  I was pleased to get a second disk which discussed the background for the making of the movie - every facet was covered - selecting actors, story line, music, picking the location etc. It was fascinating to watch and to listen to the producers, director, actors, composer and costume designer share their own input on the making of the movie.
0062127241|5.0|In reading the other reviews, as I admit I have not finished my copy, yet.  I am just so happy that Pete is still strolling this planet with us and at 67 finally published his memoirs.  I am pleased with what I have read so far.  I did not buy it to read about all the sex, drugs and rock and roll. I bought it because this man saved me from certain death when I was in high school.  I was miserable and then Pete Townshend became my hero.  A friend  turned me on to the Ooo when I was 14 in 1982. (Yes, for those who remember 1982 was supposedly THE END OF THE WHO.  So glad they changed their minds a few times.  I did get to see them live 2 times before the Ox passed.  He wore his red boots both times!).<br /><br />I agree with one of reviewers that this is not a book for the casual \\"fan\\".  I fell for the band, music, and lyrics because being a miserable wall flower of a girl who would often sit in her room listening to what was popular, I needed music that was powerful, and they made it and it made me strong.  I began speaking my mind.  I decided I'd be like Pete and not give a damn about what other people may or may not have thought of me.  Before, I would pray to God to take me in my sleep or die in an accident, or who knows maybe I would of done it to myself, but somebody saved me through his inspirational lyrics and song.<br /><br />Thank you, \\"Pete (& Roger)\\"  for at least getting old chronologically.  As long as you both write and sing, pump iron & irony you will remain young. Also, the advantage of Pete making it to 67, we have a nice, thick memoir to enjoy.  Had he published it @ 21, think of all the stuff we all would have missed out on;). Okay Roger, no question who's next to write his memoirs...<br /><br />Ooo fan forever,<br />Diana C. Rose
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This 2 DVD package is a perfect example of why you should purchase the set, rather than just viewing online from a streaming service.<br /><br />The movie is well written, the sets, acting and effects are top level and state of the art.  It leaves one with lots of questions about the Engineers and why each alien doesn't look like the ones we saw in the Alien movies: those questions are answered in a beautiful example of leading-edge technology.<br /><br />If you have an iPad or Android tablet/phone, you can download a Prometheus app that will link with your Blu-ray player if it supports BD-Live!  As the movie plays, background information is displayed on the tablet including production notes and sketches.  At certain parts of the movie, the movie is paused while a video from one of the producers/directors/special effects editors, etc., is displayed on the tablet. The movie then continues.<br /><br />At other places, alternate or deleted scenes are added to the viewing experience at the exact place they fit in the film. You have an option on the tablet to skip the experience, but it is worth watching if you truly want to appreciate the time, talent and effort that went into making this film.<br /><br />The other add-ons on the second disk, including the SD version, Digital Copy and additional resources telling you about the movie are all worth watching. The history of how the movie came into existence is remarkable, as well as how the first Alien movie was completed with a few starts and stops.  The production team and director made it all look too easy and polished when we all saw the first Alien movie...the story is an inspiration for all of us who aspire to be creative, jump hurdles and achieve goals over time.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace brings the same level of intensity and emotion to her role as she did in the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" trilogy. (She was good in Sherlock Holmes too, but the role did not offer anywhere near the challenge of this one.)<br /><br />Charlize Theron continues to amaze with her acting as a hard-core, highly disciplined, driven...but still-wanting-to-be-a-loved-daughter persona.<br /><br />Idris Elba does a great job of balancing out Theron's intensity with calm leadership, focus and demeanor: after all, it's Christmas!<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is both frightening and fascinating as the cyborg with a hidden agenda and a bad habit of listening in on other people's dreams.<br /><br />Guy Pearce makes good use of his screen time although there is not much of it: his movements and voice, along with remarkable make-up transformed him into a very old man with his own special, but not surprising, agenda.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does a good job in adding depth and texture to the story line.<br /><br />If you want to learn an interesting interpretation of the mural they find....watch the add-on info carefully.<br /><br />And....the ending leaves room for a sequel!

B000009QPG|5.0|Season's is an absolute masterpiece and the most complete Slayer album to date. It has the complexity and the more mid-tempo of South of Heaven along with the speed of Hell Awaits and Reign In Blood. The lyrics are less dark but more believable, they didn't go over the top with satanic lyrics for shock value like they did on Hell Awaits and parts of Reign In Blood. In fact there's no profanity throughout Seasosns either (PA is for violence and disturbing themes). Dave Lombardo's drumming is excellent along with the complex guitar solos rather than the random notes played on Reign In Blood or the traditional guitar riffs from Show No Mercy. The progressive sound of South Of Heaven continues here but even more so. It definitely had potential but there's more variety and the songs are much thrashier. They perfected their sound and matured a bit.  It includes their 1990 classic hit, Dead Skin Mask and 9 other awesome tracks. In my opinion, Seasons is one of the top 10 best metal albums of all time (at least).

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book for adult entertainment. Writing was elementary, but the story line certainly captured my attention.<br />Overall a rating of 5.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First two books captured my attention and kept me guessing, however; I felt that the 3rd book story line was cut short. I felt cheated and did not like the ending.
B00514HDNW|4.0|To my understanding, this book is what most modern vampire and zombie movies are based.  A great ready for any fan of the genre,but yet also a great read for anyone who likes a well written book.
B002SSBD6W|4.0|Every once in a while I read a book that reminds me of why I don't eat animals. But it isn't exactly what you would expect. There's more to be said here about the advocacy for family farming than everything else.<br /><br />I am already a vegetarian but I would advise to those that do you will feel guilty about it after reading this unless you are one of the few that eats humanely raised and slaughtered meat.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Of the three books my favorite was the second. The first book offered more closure  whereas the second book left you hanging.  This series I thought was amazingly well written part two offers a lot more detail And history of Panem.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|For me it always starts with prose and as seems to be the trend with Martin's it is easy to follow and really just a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Other than that I find it hard to write about books in a series. Should you keep going? YES!<br /><br />This one moves at about the same pace as the first one with a bit slower of a finish. Even the big stuff doesn't feel all that grandiose (but this isn't a bad thing).<br /><br />There is one thing that happens in this book where I had to breathe a sigh of relief when the events didn't actually come to pass.<br /><br />Really the major point here is keep going because I sure am.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I like the second as my favorite of all three books However Third book had some amazing scenes that took me by surprise more than I think that the rest.  The last few pages everything is wrapped up for the reader to understand And does give some insight into the human species that sometimes we just don't learn.

1455502758|4.0|I've always found it important when discussing Christopher Hitchens with other admirers to find out what it is about him that they are drawn to. This is because there is a critical distinction between Christopher Hitchens the man and Christopher Hitchens the author. Many are drawn to Hitchens the man -- the orator, the personality, the drinker, the symbol -- but are impatient with his writing. Others are drawn to the personality that he portrayed with his words: an obtuse champion of atheism, possessed with the courage to confront religious fanaticism on its own terms; the dogged reporter, sodden with drink and smoke; the scathingly intelligent logician; the composer. Perhaps only few find themselves drawn to both.<br /><br />I have always thought Hitchens' prose to be superior, albeit rotten to some extent by his success. Perhaps this is jealousy, and perhaps he really was overrated. But my quibbles fell away when I was confronted with 'Mortality.'<br /><br />To call this book spare is a shameful understatement -- I read it over the course of about a day. It is essentially a half-dozen essays from the early portion of his diagnosis with cancer, all of which had run in Vanity Fair, joined with notes and fleeting paragraphs scribbled in his dying hours and a eulogy written by his late wife, Carol Blue. Like life itself, it is over too soon, with too much left unsaid.<br /><br />In a sense, Mortality opens almost as a movie in which Hitchens the writer is narrating the final chapter in the life of Hitchens the man. There is a detachment in his voice as he discusses what he knows to be, at best, a serious brush with death. He still finds it a worthy use of his time and energy early in the book, for example, to pontificate on whether his well wishers should pray for his eternal soul. But that detachment slowly fades as his condition worsens. He becomes more serious, hope of regaining something like his previous life fades and as he creeps closer to nothingness, it feels as though the man and his voice finally fuse into one.as though the man and his voice finally fuse into one.

B0017SWPXY|2.0|I liked the idea behind the book.  A dog telling the story.  But I didnt think many of the incidents in the story made a lot of sense to me.  The story of Enzo's encounter with the crows was meant to be funny but I didn't find it so and I didn't like the dog using profanity.<br /> The scene with the 15 years old girl who attacked Denny did not ring true to me. Denny, no matter how exausted wouldn't have been so helpless.  I thought the parents decision to keep Zoe  made the most sense of all but of course I was pulling for Denny to get his daugher and I liked the way it turned out.  I wish the author had kept the dog in dog heaven running through the clouds and chasing heavenly animals instead of the way it ended. The metaphores of the racing with life was clever and ineresting.  I appreciated that.
0786958731|5.0|If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game, this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.<br /><br />Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.<br /><br />First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces, all the cards, the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.<br /><br />Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.<br /><br />The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures.

B0018RE7DU|4.0|This movie is indeed looking dated, but I still enjoyed watching it. I enjoy looking at Richard Gere now as much as the first time I saw him in this....when I 22! He displayed a talent at this young age that has served him well. Supporting cast was great. Music always fantastic!<br /><br />While I adore Lauren Hutton, I have always felt she was miscast in this movie. I had a problem with lack of chemistry between the two main charachters. A tad unbelievable, as she seemed too old & overly sophisticated. Other than that, it was great entertainment.
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|Linkin Park used to be my favorite rock group, their sound was so innovative and different. On their first two albums i loved just about every single song. There was heavy metal, rap, piano & guitar riffs that blended together so smoothly and just made an amazing and unique sound. Now....I don't recognize this piss poor excuse of a group anymore. I don't know what made them decide this kind of music is what their fans want, but it definitely is not!  I don't wanna hear that \\"they've grown musically\\" BS...all they've done is alienate a their loyal fans.  This is why nobody talks about Linkin Park anymore, nobody cares! They've alienated their true fans and they're not picking up any new ones putting out this kind of garbage. I think it's time for me to just give up, and realize the Linkin Park I grew up loving is gone forever.

B008O037RG|2.0|Nice album cover; nice piece of vinyl too but shockingly poor content.<br /><br />A small group of us review new realeses every month and use a scale of 1-5 wheelbarrows (don't ask, it involved vodka). This album hovered around the 1.5 wheelbarrow mark but given we don't do halves we agreed to let it be 2 as it makes for unintrusive background music.<br /><br />I've played it a number of times since our review and it simply does not grow on me. I liked their previous album and hoped they would mature with this one but actually they regressed IMHO.<br /><br />I'll keep playing it because sometimes you only get an album after multiple playings but that usually applies to something that is layered, to date this one seems one dimensional.<br /><br />Because reviews are so personal I'm not going to go into specific details on the banjo there or the guitar here, I suggest you buy the album and see if YOU like it. You might!<br /><br />UPDATE Dec 5th:<br /><br />So some time has passed and I continue to rotate this album into my 'playlist'. It just hasn't got any better for me I'm afraid.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I really don't know why people are freaking about about the fact that this album has some elements of dubstep (in a couple of songs). If you remember, MUSE have been taking new electronic styles and blending them in their own way and making an amazing sound. It is no different with this album. Not only do they integrate new elements, they also have some throw back elements, and it is lovely. I highly recomend this album.

B003Y5H5FG|2.0|That is a play on the tagline of The Original Movie. The Fright Night remake which is better acted than the original better effects & in all instances is better than the original. IF YOU ARE HIGH! I know that's mean & rude but that's how I feel. I'm going to tear this movie a new a  s  s hole. This was just another pointless remake just like The Halloween remake just like The Nightmare On Elm Street remake & so many others. As I have always said we all have our likes & dislikes when I hate on a movie it's not against the fans of that movie it's against the movie. This is a rant so don't leave mean & rude comments or I will reply in kind if I mispell things in this rant well it's a RANT. I don't hate every remake. I like The Thing from 1982. The Blob from 1988, The Fly from 1986. Even remakes made the past few years like Dawn Of The Dead, The Hills Have Eyes & The Friday The 13th remake. Before I rant on this pos let me tell  you 2 ideas that would've made this unique. Todd Farmer had a script that would've had Tom Atkins & Jamie Lee Curtis star in incresingly bad remakes of Fright Night they work The Horror Convintions & Jamie Lee would've been written as a money hungry coward. Jerry Dandridge's assistant Billy would've fought Derek Mears at a Horror Convintion. The structure would've been the same as the original but would've had different situations that were diffent & more violent. Charley would tell Tom Atkins what he saw Tom Atkins would've been amused & just played along cause he had nothing better to do. Another script would've taken place where Fright Night is just a popular movie the main character believe's a Vampire lives next door he wouldn't seek out the help of anyone named Peter Vincent. He would seek out the help of Chris Sarandon who played Jerry Dandridge in the original Fright Night who would know better if there is a Vampire next door. If you wonder why this got rejected everyone in the board room loved the ideas I think they were brillant. HeadExecutive Of Screen Gems Clint Culpepper the same studio who gave us The Prom Night remake which is a CW version & an insault to the original & The Stepfather remake said \\"Duh I don't get it.\\" Yeah but you thought that The Prom Night remake was an awesome idea you dip<br />s  h  i  t. It's The Clint Culpepper's of the world why movie quality is down from the 80's & 90's they should be cleaning out the toilet's at the studio not making the decison's Dreamworks had a hand in this movie at 1 time they wanted to make it family friendly which explains the low body count & cartooney gore. Anyway let's get to this Teeny Bopper version of Fright Night. Made on a budget of $30 million made $18 million in The US. internationally it made $23 million so worlwide it made $41 million but it was a bomb cause do you know how much extra money goes into the marketing & advertising & the gross share of money among theaters. Directed by Craig Gillespie he directed Mr Woodcock & Lars & The Real Girl on top of directing episodes of Untited States Of Tara. He had about as much credibility directing a horror film as George Tillman did directing a action movie. It stars Anton Yelchin as Charley Brewster, Colin Farell as Jerry Dandruff I mean Dandridge I say that cause he has the hair cut that's straight out of Twlight. David Tennant as Peter Vincent, Toni Collette as Jane Brewster she was on that show UST so that's how she got the job. Imgoen Poots as Amy peterson & Christopher Mintz Plasse as \\"Evil Ed\\". Story is Jerry Dandridge kills this family. Then you have a joke orf an opening where Fright Night pops up it just looked so cheap. So you have The CW version of Fright Night that takes place in The Suburbs Of Las Vegas so they can relate to The CW crowd. Your introduced to Charley Brewster & his Mom Jane & Charley's Girlfriend Amy that looks straight out of The CW & their relationship isn't believeable. Charley's Mom looks straight out of The CW. I mean when I was growing up not very manyof the kids I knew had hot Mom's they looked like real Mom's even in the older horror movies most of the Mom's looked like real Mom's they weren't hottie's. Charley is just so unlikeable he turned his back on his friend Evil Ed to be popular & hang out with the cool kids & be a tool. The kid at the beginning that is killed was friends with Evil Ed Charley used to hang out with them. Your introduced to Jerry Dandridge who looks like an older version of the lead dork in The Twlight movies he has the pale skin & the hair cut. You haved Evil Ed tell Charley that his neighbor is a Vampire. I was like wtf it didn't make sense. They take a stab at Twlight which I'm thinking this movie has a villain that looks straight out of Twlight. You also have homage after homage like Jerry eating an apple like in the origina. Evil Ed talks smack about Charley's girlfriend & calls him out on why he's became jerk. Charley shoves Evil Ed & tells him \\"You know when my life started getting better is when I stopped being friends with you.\\"So I'm suppose to root & care about this a  s  s hole. Wouldn't have been bettter if Evil Ed was the lead since he seems to know about Jerry being a Vampire & Charley is unlikeable there is no likeable characters& I will say until the day I die \\"When I don't care about the characters I don't care about the movie.\\" There's a scene where Jerry asks Charley for some beers & Colin Farrell in this scene just kept talking & talking & I was like dude STFU. Charley seeks out the help of Peter Vincent who is a Magican & an expert in the occult & that makes him an expert in Vampires & his parents were killed by Jerry Dandridge & he doesn't help Charley. You have them do another homage to the original where Charley is looking out the window & not paying attention to Amy & he falls asleep & wakes up when he hears screams from next door. Jerry leavs the house so Charley breaks into his house he picks a lock to get in he looks up how to pick a lock on his i phone the director needs to google how to direct. Charley finds these secret rooms he finds this lady from next door. Jerry returns wow that was a quick trip. Jerry bites her . Charley tries to rescue this chick when they get outside the girl dies due to the sunlight. Which that was the quickest turn from human to vampire & she died in a horrific CGI effect. Later on you have Jerry go to their house Charley won't let him in so Jerry digs us a gas line & sets the house on fire they get out of there. Jerry throws a motorcycle into the back of the van. The effect of the motorcycle going into the back of the van is really shoddy CGI. Everytime taht Jerry rams the van with his truck & the glass breaks in the van in a cartoon CGI effect. Jane runs Jerry over & he hides under the van. You know what this reminded me of the episode of The Simpsons where Side Show Bob hid under the car. He starts punching holes under the van they stop the van. Then you have scene that made me mad as fire you have Jerry in his Vampire form which is done in some horrible CGI he kills a motorist played by Chris Sarandon the original Jerry Dandridge. To say were the new Fright Night I seriously wanted to find Craig Gillespie & yell the right act at him cause this movie is an insault to the original.  & The CGI for Jerry's Vampire form is awful. You mean to tell me that practical effects can't be done anymore cause they can I've seen direct to DVD movies on $5 & $10 million budgets do it. Practical effects like the make up effects blood squibs can all still be done. They just don't do it cause there lazy. Jane takes a Century 21st sign & stabs Jerry in the back was that suppose to be funny or suppose to be a moment to make you yell yeah get him. Either way it fell flat. Was Century 21st sponsering this movie btw.  Jane faints I don't know how or why she did. They have Charley act sorry for the way he treated all his old friends which I didn't buy just like I didn't buy Charley & Amy's relationship in this movie.  Perter Vincent calls Charley they go to his place. Then you have Evil Ed come in to try & kill Peter Vincent now the original Peter Vincent was afraid of The Vampires nut his reactions felt real & he had great moments like when he fights Evil Ed in the original or when he kills Evil Ed in the original or when he fires that gun at Billy or helps Charley fight Jerry Dandridge in the original. Even in Fright Night II Peter Vincent has more to do than Peter Vincent in the remake plus you had Roddy McDowall who was great. Charley & Amy kill Evil Ed. Jerry chases after them all the way to a Night Club like in the original Jerry puts Amy under a trance & bites her like in the original. I'd rather watch the original. Cause when they constanly referance & homage a previous movie I'd rather watch the original. Charley goes off buys stuff to kill Vampires when he suits up it's not cool like Alice in NOES 4 it's laughable it's like The Ghostbusters version of a Vampire Killer. I'm going to skip ahead basically Peter Vincent fires a shot gun at Jerry Dandridge & he can't shoot to save his life. Charley puts on a fire suit sets himself on fire & when he puts on the mask Anton Yelchin looks so goofy I just paused & laughed at it. I mean this dude is on fire for over a minute I don't think a fire suit can last that long you'd probably be a crispy critter. Anyway Charley catches Jerry on fire he burns up in a atrocious CGI effect then Charley puts the stake into his chest & he dies in some of the worst CGI i have ever seen. Charley & Amy get it on at Peter Vincent's place & I'm glad this movie was over. The cast was terrible imo. There was nobody to root for. They got picked cause they had pretty faces not on acting ability. I'm tired of this CW look in horror movies. Jerry Dandridge looks like a Twlight dork. The CGI is atrocious. The score is forgettable by Ramin Dsueadi it has nothing on the great scores from Fright Night 1 & II. I'm glad this movie tanked I doubt there's going to be a Fright Night 2 Electric Boogaloo. Craig Gillespie you should be ashamed. Anton Yelchin  I don't blame him for doing bad in this movie I blame the writing. Colin Farrell was horible & he went on to ruin another classic Total Recall which was another reamke that he's done & it tanked. Toni Collette was bad. Imogen Poots replace the T with a P & that sums up what I thought of her perfomance. Dabid Tennant wasn't any good & The Peter Vincent character was pointless in this movie. Christopher Mintz Plasse was ok. Just watch the original & part II this movie just blows.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Prometheus sure ain't for everybody; it's too slow for horror fans, too horrific for art house fans, too anti-romantic and too weird for many in general, and too full of mild plot holes for uptight geeks who don't know how to relax and enjoy truly gorgeous images. But I've been loving Scott's work since going to Alien as a kid in 1979 and for me this is perhaps the perfect summation of many of his themes and the consummation of many of his incredible visual signatures.<br /><br />The opening of Prometheus is just mind-blowingly stunning, Lord Of The Rings epic but with its own special otherworldly feel. The Iceland landscapes are stunning, and as at various points during the film my jaw literally dropped in true amazement at both the perfection of the framing and the insane depth and color of the blu-ray image. This has got to be the best BD transfer I've ever seen except perhaps Baraka and Up.<br /><br />Add to that the sort of attention to quality and detail that all good movies deserve on BD, and you've got a disc that's well worth the 20 clams they want here. The dvd is only a sad reminder of how awesome 50gb of BD space can be when used for an image this crisp and a soundtrack this wide and how 7.4 gigs just can't ever compare.<br /><br />How much time did they spend making this blu-ray good? Well, the movie audio has 28 different subtitle tracks. 28! Including two commentaries in various languages. Even the well-laid out deleted scenes have 18 subtitle tracks. Normally it's a miracle to get one. The Weyland film they made just as an extra is another excellent addition with lots of good ideas the film couldn't assimilate.<br /><br />But caring about every detail like that is Scott's hallmark, and his exemplary commentary is typically sharp and incisive, with many drily humorous thoughts on the film making process and some great jabs at the moneymen who still don't let him do what he wants, despite a career as fine as almost any modern director's.<br /><br />The deleted scenes extra shows how wisely ruthless Scott can be as an editor; many fine things were dumped but in hindsight you can see why he cut each one, as good as some were. He wants to preserve the mystery and weirdness that comes with leaving out some details, and he gets so much intense atmosphere so often that he makes most directors seem like they're still in film school.<br /><br />Whereas the details he leaves in, with many references to his own masterpieces Blade Runner and Alien and also 2001 and other sci-fi landmarks, all work together to highlight the truly interesting central conceit here: the earth as petri dish for people. If you've read much Sitchin you know this idea is rich with possibility and perhaps even probability. Scott plows into it with verve, and the effects and cgi folks do him proud.<br /><br />There are some cgi scenes here that redefine the art, especially the alien ship cosmos map scene. Wow. Watch that in slo-mo on a good LCD screen and be awestruck. I really wish I'd seen this in an Ima. Sigh.<br /><br />But movies do not live on images alone, and the performance that really carries the drama is from Fassbender, who takes Rutger Hauer's emotional ice from Blade Runner and warms it up to vapor, saying volumes as the perfectly sly cyborg with wry glances and deft details of movement.<br /><br />Rapace and Elba certainly have their moments, and no one is weak, but it's the visual splendors that are the real star of this film.<br /><br />All that said, this is not for everyone. It's too harsh and too slow if you're not totally into the tale, and I could see where it could drag. But if you love sci-fi, the art of film and an epic film maker with a truly unleashed imagination, Prometheus is a delight that will only get better as time goes by.<br /><br />It also highlights various parallels between Scott and James Cameron in both epic scope and idea (each also chose Sigourney Weaver as his favorite hero archetype---the indomitable professional woman), but Ridley is more about the mind game while Cameron goes for the heart. This makes his films much more successful, but I think as time goes by Scott's vision is emerging as one of the finest of all living filmmakers. Who else has done a film like this and also (the sadly neglected but wonderfully sharp) Matchstick Men? Now that's breadth.<br /><br />I've always dreamed of a sequel to Blade Runner, and I guess this is as close as we'll get. And while it lacks BR's once-in-a-lifetime feel, it has a visual sophistication that not only makes BR seem primitive but redefines how wild a movie can look while still seeming real. My eyes are still reeling.<br /><br />The main qualm I have is the music, which is always big but never deeply memorable like Vangelis' incomparable Blade Runner OST. It's the Giger-esque imagery that haunts the brain most here, and Scott's various tributes and nods to his filmic past make Prometheus a many-layered visual and mental splendor for cinephiles with patience, open minds and hungry eyes.he indomitable professional woman), but Ridley is more about the mind game while Cameron goes for the heart.

B000FCKC4C|1.0|After reading The Alchemist I do not understand what all the fuss is about.  It reads like a self-help manual and is full of cliches about following your dreams and making them come true.  There is not much of a plot and there is a total lack of feeling for the protagonist.  Nothing can turn this book into gold!

B00914JWSW|4.0|Barbra Streisand's most recent album of \\"previously unreleased\\" material is mostly unreleased.  2 of the songs on the album have been released, though not the versions that appear on this album.<br /><br />\\"Didn't We\\" appeared on her 1972 Live Concert at the Forum album, and that version was actually better than the version released on this new album in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"With One More Look At You\\" was also released on the Star is Born soundtrack.  I've never been a big fan of this song and it's not like it was a chart-topping hit, so I am not sure why Barbra felt the need to release another version of the song.<br /><br />The rest of the material is all previously unreleased and the majority of it is superb and exactly what die-hard Streisand fans would have given their eye teeth for back in the bootleg days of the 70's when several recording session tapes were leaked and fans passed them around like it was a rare exotic find.<br /><br />Of all of the previously unreleased songs there are only 2 which I don't really care for;<br />\\"Lost in Wonderland\\" seems like it was one of those songs for Barbra, ala Minute Waltz where she sang just to show she could sing it.  It seems rushed and uninspired.  Understanding that she recorded this very early in her career, I think an older Barbra would have handled the material better ala the Bossa Nova treatments she has given several songs on the last few albums she did,all which sounded effortless and breezy,while Wonderland sounds frenetic and rushed.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" from the musical The Wiz has more fizz than Wiz.  You can even hear Barbra say right before she starts singing that she wants to go home.  I can understand why this was never released as it is one of the rare times where Barbra has sounded completely uninspired in what she is singing.  This song does nothing for her. It is not challenging vocally and it's not even really up to her caliber.<br /><br />Stand out songs for me are \\"Try to Win A Friend\\"' \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\", \\"If It's Meant to Be\\", and the Medley with \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra/ Heather on The Hill\\"<br /><br />That leaves \\"Willow Weep for Me\\", \\"Being Good\\" and \\"Mother and Child\\", all of which are sung technically proficient by Barbra, but they just lack a spark.  Her voice doesn't sparkle on them like it does when she is singing something you know she is enjoying, so I can understand why it has taken so long for these to make it on to an album.<br /><br />With all this said, I rate this 4 stars because I think the songs that worked for me have that magical Streisand quality and that enough is worth it for me or any other die-hard fan.  Also, I give her credit for having the guts to release this stuff while she still has control over it and while she is still singing wonderfully. It's interesting how the one song on this collection from 2011 works so well with the other earlier material and really shows that while she may have lost some range and her voice may be scratchy at times, the timbre and tonal quality is still there even while she is pushing 70 and that in and of itself is amazing!<br /><br />If you're a die-hard fan, you can't pass this up. I also recommend Jason Gould's new album which not so coincidentally was released on the same day as Barbra's album.  Who knew he could sing and that he is a chip of the old block. He's a Josh Groban without the overpowering vibrato and the one thing he has that Groban doesn't is his mom's timbre and vocal quality and that is worth the price of admission.k It's Going To Rain Today\\", \\"If It's Meant to Be\\", and the Medley with \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra/ Heather on The Hill\\"<br /><br />That leaves \\"Willow Weep for Me\\", \\"Being Good\\" and \\"Mother and Child\\", all of which are sung technically proficient by Barbra, but they just lack a spark.  Her voice doesn't sparkle on them like it does when she is singing something you know she is enjoying, so I can understand why it has taken so long for these to make it on to an album.<br /><br />With all this said, I rate this 4 stars because I think the songs that worked for me have that magical Streisand quality and that enough is worth it for me or any other die-hard fan.  Also, I give her credit for having the guts to release this stuff while she still has control over it and while she is still singing wonderfully. It's interesting how the one song on this collection from 2011 works so well with the other earlier material and really shows that while she may have lost some range and her voice may be scratchy at times, the timbre and tonal quality is still there even while she is pushing 70 and that in and of itself is amazing!<br /><br />If you're a die-hard fan, you can't pass this up. I also recommend Jason Gould's new album which not so coincidentally was released on the same day as Barbra's album.  Who knew he could sing and that he is a chip of the old block.

B008HK3S9K|5.0|This case is very well constructed.  Pictures appear as though this is a more 'soft' case.  However, the unit is actually slightly rigid with foam and seam construction for impact absorption.  The lining inside is also scratch resistant.  The specs for this product state that it is only for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", but my older Kindle fits inside just fine.  -  It is a little loose, but does not float around inside much at all.  The package specs state that this unit fits up to 8.07 in tall and 5.5 in wide by .5 in deep.  (FYI: Photos appear as though the burgundy band on this is more 'satiny', however, it is actually textured.)  This is a very attractive and well designed case.
B009FKZ9AM|5.0|Great 2nd effort from these boys from London. Hard to believe that they have only been together as a band since 2010.
B008XG1X18|3.0|it keeps foreclosing on my kindle. not happy!! please fix that issue I don't want to have to continuously uninstall &amp; reinstall
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Having now had several listens to the new 'Sunken Condos' album from DF and I like it... but not nearly as much as 'Morph the Cat'. I'm interested to note the many reminders of earlier work. A bit like the Rolling Stones fairly recent \\"Bigger Bang\\" album, which had reminders and references to virtually all their earlier eras of work.<br /><br />\\"Weather in My Head\\" could very easily be an extra track on Steely Dan's \\"Do it Again\\" album. It sounds 'old Dan' to me... and I like it a lot.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not sure the lyrics warrant especially close attention though. Too many themes seem to concern the plight of a man who is advancing in years, while surrounded by beautiful women.. (poor chap)... IE: Slinky Thing / I'm Not the Same Without You / The New Breed / Miss Marlene / Planet D'Rhonda.<br /><br />I find the overall package sounds great. The final track 'Planet D'Rhonda' is typical of the whole album. It has some lovely guitar work and a great feel musically..... however, sitting with the little book of lyrics and reading along has the effect of diminishing that song...<br /><br />I think the situation was the same with two of Rhonda's friends, namely Pixeleen and that frequent lunch companion, Gina......  (see Steely Dan's most recent album: 'Everything Must Go')
B005KELW26|5.0|I absolutely love this!! It is light weight and protects my kindle fire. I love the color.<br />I highly recommend this case for any one who owns or is considering buying a kindle fire and is looking for a case.

B00003CXS4|5.0|Awesome movie!  Highly entertaining and fun plot line. Mickey is one of my favorite characters played by Brad Pitt. And Jason Statham's commentary throughout just adds to the entertainment.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks is an amazing author, and is a great resource for information on zombies. Can‘t wait for his next book.
1568363931|5.0|This is a very organized bento cookbook. It has a glossary of common japanese ingredients and sections for making \\"japanese\\" and \\"not-so-japanese\\" bentos. Includes cooking timelines, items to prep the night before, and simple variations of recipes. Great book, would recommend highly.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day, took me right into the entire mission from beginnig to end.  Extremely well written and authenticated by the fact that an actual operator of the mission wrote it.  Finally, a first hand account and not some word of mouth author!
B003G4W49C|5.0|a friend in high school read this aand told me ths ending before i had  chance to read it.  i had always thought that knowing the end would make the book boring and bland.  all i can say is that i was dead wrong, it was an amazing story written perfectly.  one of the few books to really stir emotions whie reading.  100% recommend.<br /><br />aplogize on spelling and grammer.  writting on new kindle paperwhite...also amazing.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Even though the show starts out a little slow, and even though there are several plot holes, the show has many intense moments that make up for; specifically the surgery scene.  The visuals and special effects are extraordinary, and the acting, mostly from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender (as Elizabeth Shaw and the android David respectively), is very well done.  The ending is also very well done and is an obvious setup for a future sequal(s).  This show is definitely one of the beginning pieces to the Alien prequal (Ridley Scott confirmed he was going to do more), and even though it leaves multiple unanswered questions, it is definitely worth watching; especially if you are a sci-fi or an alien fan in particular.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Ok-so when I first listened to the 30 second track samples of \\"Monster\\", I was thinking this wasn't going to be a very good cd. Listened<br />to it the first time, thought it was ok. The second time I listened to it-I couldn't get enough of it. I read another review where<br />someone said it was a bit like \\"Revenge\\", which was one of my favorites. \\"Monster\\" tops it. This cd ROCKS!!! But I must say before I<br />go further that I thought \\"Sonic Boom\\" was good too and I get tired of hearing it get ranked on. So back to \\"Monster\\"-I have NEVER<br />EVER bought a cd and liked EVERY song on it. All the songs are bad ass, my favorites are Hell or Hallelujah, Mercy, Freak-is killer, Eat your heart out,I just like them all. And \\"Outta This World\\" and \\"For The Love of Rock & ROll\\"-totally kick ass. My opinion is this and I'm sure alot of people won't like it-Tommy THayer and Eric Singer are EVERY bit as good if not better than Ace & Peter. . These guys can rock, sing and play better than ever. This has become my favorite cd, I've listened to it every day since I got it.<br />If you really want my opinion-buy this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00976NY6A|3.0|I came late to the Killers (about three years ago), but become a quick fan of their entire library.  While Hot Fuss and Day and Age are my two favorites, I felt a steady progression and growth through all of their albums over the years.  I don't know that I feel that on Battle Born.  There are a few stand-outs (the title track, Runaways, possibly Here With Me) but the rest of it feels more like an unsteady drone.<br /><br />I think this album has more of a feel like a background movie soundtrack than a strong release by what is arguably one of the greatest rock bands to emerge from the past decade or so.  I'm sure that I will continue to listen to tracks off of this recording, but count me as one eagerly awaiting the next album from either the band or Brandon Flowers solo.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book is another great book written by Mitch Albom.  He has rapidly become one of my favorite authors.  I would recommend all his books.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|There's only a few things that I saw wrong with this film after viewing it a second time after I saw it at the theatre after it came out and the one scene where Mark Ruffallo playing the part of the Hulk when he was in the New York Scene getting ready to go after the giant metal creature thing in the middle of the street as it was coming at him changed into the Hulk within a split few seconds after he told Captain America that that was his secret \\"that he was always angry\\", the Hulk is supposed to have a transition period as to where he turns into the Hulk as the transition takes some time and he turned too quick as there is another scene where they show him fighting against the Black Widow on the helicarrier and that transition took some time, if he's capable of turning so quickly then why do they show him turning into the Hulk within a few seconds of being angry (?) - (but I could never understand as to why he wants to destroy everything if he's a superhero and is supposed to be helping his fellow man and friends that are also superheros? - the rivalry is nice to see sometimes amongst them but it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense), but I understand that it's just escapest entertainment but I often wonder how they make it look so real.<br /><br />Also in the movie Thor that has some transition stuff in it to this film - How did the rainbow bridge get rebuilt after it was destroyed in that movie? I guess there is going to be a sequel to that movie as well?<br /><br /> I still dig that scene where Loki (Thor's brother) when battling the Hulk in Stark Tower tells Hulk he's a God and won't tolerate humans telling him what to do gets picked up and slammed around like a rag doll and then after the attack he looks as if he just got hit by a freight train and is thinking to himself as to what the hell just hit him, and then Hulk says 'foolish god' as he walks off.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|Great Great movie.  I first rented the movie and then bought it.  It is a wonderful love story.  Loved the ending.  Highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finally got to read it! It is as good as everyone says it is! I'm not one for action books but i loved this. :)
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was terrible. I guess I was expecting too much because I actually read the Harry Potter series along with my son as he was growing up. I was not looking for an adult version of that series. I was under the mistaken belief that the author would write something for adults that would draw one in to an interesting story.<br /><br />The plot was extremely heavy and self-involved. None of the characters were likeable or interesting. I kept reading because I thought that maybe, just maybe there might be a story. However, I was wrong. I felt as though the author was simply writing to tell something that she thought would be interesting without regard to creating an interesting story for her readers. Extremely dissapointed in this one. I doubt that I will ever read anything by this author again but I am sure that she is crying all the way to the bank. Sometimes, I think, it helps to have a need to create something that people will actually enjoy reading. That was clearly not the goal of this author.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Using to have employees and customers complete forms on Kindle, including signatures.  Works like a charm!  Would give 5 stars if file handling (e.g. having to save copies to make them editable, etc.) were a little less onerous, although in fairness at least some of this must be attributed to the constraints of the Kindle. Would give 6 stars if had ability to handle pushing to PC/network.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read \\"Little Women\\" when I was in junior high school and I loved the book.  I decided to re-read it and I am glad I did.  So much fiction today is lacking in plot, character development, and thought, in short, this is good literature.  This is one of the best books around for people of all ages.  I so appreciate that the March family experienced the joys and pains of everyday living and handled both with dignity, spirit, and a genuine love for each other. Even though poor, the March family rose above it.  So many lessons are taught in this book that young people, particularly, could benefit from reading it.  I will add this to my reading list of books that I read every couple of years!
B0036T32LQ|5.0|I can't recommend this film enough.  The less you know going in, the better it is.  Stick with it, pay attention to details, and it will blow your mind.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I read this book in jr. High and it always stuck with me. So yeah i bought it again and enjoyed it. Just wish there was a part 2. Still great for the imagination.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the best modern coming of age stories I've ever read. I found myself totally engrossed in this book and was very disappointed when I was finished reading because I just wanted more.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|I'm more of a family movie type...But Machete is fantastic! I've seen it 184 times! It's funny,sexy,slashey (is that a word?) and it actually has a social ideal. Danny Treheo is a beautiful actor.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Pretty fun game, good for hours of mindless fun. The enhancements make the game pretty challenging. Much like the original except you can rebuild buildings that are hit and select upgrades between levels.
B0054N73EY|5.0|I have been an avid Chili's fan for a long time and I appreciate their variety in sound over the years. This is probably why I enjoyed I'm With You so much. To me, it sounds most like their last album, Stadium Arcadium. Emotional, melodic, badass. My favorite song is probably the most melodic, Brendan's Death Song. It's just beautiful. I was skeptical at first, but thrilled with this album.
0792840461|1.0|The Thomas Crown Affair movie 1968<br />Wrong item shipped - who is in charge? I don't think it was me.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Not too good, but not too bad, just entertaining. It is the first book I read from the author, I might give a chance other titles.
B00005KB9X|5.0|This was my first exposure to Bob Marley and the Wailers. In New Zealand in the early seventies, it turned up in Taste Record store and at the time I was not interested in reggae. Prolonged exposure to ska at school and through my merchant seaman brother's Desmond Dekker singles did not progress on to reggae. So reggae was out of my then field of interest but it happened to be summer and a blue haze occupied the mind and this album grew and grew in power with each playing. It flows as a statement without being a concept album (big in those times \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" etc). The combination of musicians works well and brother Bob's scratchy rhythm guitar supports his honey and smoke vocals. The lyrics are political and to the point. The language immerses you into a drawl that conceals universal messages. Of course it has \\"No Woman No Cry\\" but that is not the exceptional track on this album. \\"No Woman\\" is more understated here than the stadium/live anthem signature tune it became. \\"Lively up Yourself\\", \\"Them Belly Full\\" and \\"Three O Clock Roadblock\\" remain favourites and show Marley's skilled song smithing. Then there are the Wailers post Peter Tosh, tight and competent musicians one and all. It remains my favourite Marley album but only because of that first offering opening into a world where reggae music is King! And I soared! And Soared!.
1595825045|5.0|It is a big and thick book. Printed 100% in color! Full of pictures, sketches and a lot of behind the scenes information.

I will be waiting!<br /><br />Awesome work, Brian, Michael and Nicklodeon!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Rodrigo A. Costa (Brazil)
B0051HCUIW|5.0|This is a good film. Music is a bit naff. Little voice, the character grates from time to time but Jane Horrocks in the role is grand. But it is the comedy act of Michael Caine and Brenda Blethyn that makes this a stand out. Mr Caine as a seedy, still trying to break a start music agent, and playing catch up in a changing world (even in the north) of music's road to stardom via the working mens' clubs. But he drives the car. Brenda Blethyn is a wired up fish wife with a heart bigger than Grimsby (small English fishing fleet town) and a letdown in life the equivalent of being sent to live out the rest of your days (many and long) in Peterborough (another English town but without a fishing fleet and a population who speaks with a nasaly twang). The weakness, other than a soppy Ewan McGregor was Ms Horrocks' voice. Ok, she can sing but then so can I in the bath, but would I want to put it on celluloid. Sigh, I guess reality TV answers that one. But it is a left of centre, working community story-enough bitter to make the sweet palatable. Give it a watch. Mr caine and ms Blethyn gyrate to Tom Jones is worth the entry ticket alone and the pigeons!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This is a sharp case for my new Kindle Fire HD. Good quality, durable & nice looking.<br /><br />My issue is not a big deal at all so don't necessarily let it turn you away...<br />I placed the Kindle in the case so I can hold it like an open book when I read.<br />The cover opens to the left. The Kindle's on the right.<br />That's also the best way when you have it sitting horizontally for Skyping.<br />The camera would be located on the top.<br /><br />Great--except when you want to charge the Kindle you can't close the case. You have to leave it open because the micro-USB port is located on the fold side of the case.<br /><br />Get it?<br /><br />They really should put a small pre-cut hole in the fold of the case so you can close it up & charge the Kindle when not in use.<br /><br />Otherwise I like it.
B00005MCX0|5.0|The second album. The first was a bit messy and no near a reflection of their live sound. This though starts off with \\"You shouldn't do that\\" 16 minutes down the runway with busy, driving space rock . In 1971,on vinyl it did your head in-the swooping, whooshing soundscapes and Terry Ollis's urgent drum beat. Even more intense on \\"Master of the Universe\\". I appreciated the almost bluesy \\"We took the wrong step years ago\\" with David Brock's acoustic, but mabe the track most similar to \\"Mirror of Illusion and Hurry on Sundown\\" off the first album. \\"Adjust me\\" a wadge of Michael Moorcock is perhaps the most space filler (excuse pun) track. A sign of Hawkwind things to come I fear. But this is a more stand alone complete album full of electronic twirls and Nik Turner piercing electrified sax. Remastered it still sounds good. Not sure why I don't put this album on more often, particularly the first three tracks. But in time, it has not kept the freshness of that side of things. Bonus tracks ok but \\"Silver Machine\\" a precursor to Lemmy and his big greasy motorcycle sounds is what it was-a hit single of banal proportions. Still give it a five for the thrusters, the drive. On a dark and starry night somewhere out in that universe is Hawkwind plugging in.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was a book I think everyone should read regardless of there views on the military and the government
B000001FY7|5.0|1978 album, it was in my view one of his last decent output albums. Nice tracks subsequent, but albums after this tended to have a bit too much filler for my liking. But gotta love the man. I am pleased Mr Marley graced this planet and laid down some memorable music. I have drunk deeply of his output and it is sustaining for the mind and soul. Kaya stands tall. There is some very good, understated but well executed lead guitar. Some good, if not patchy lyrics. There is the bouncy, thrashed to death \\"Is this Love\\". But it has some other humdinger lesser known tracks in \\"She's Gone\\" and \\"Running Away\\". Add \\"Crisis\\" and you have a distinct sense Mr Marley-loverman might have taken a bit of a burning leading to the composition of some of these tracks. It also has the magnificent \\"Sun is shining\\", there is a good cover of this by Black Uhuru (with Sly and Robbie) on reggae compilations, and it is good to match it alongside the original. Kaya is well worth a listen and with parting with a bit of brass to add to the shelf.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I kept reading it but the writing is definitely a Navy Seal Not an experienced author.  Flashing back and forth between years is done trying to excite the reader but is just flash and burn childish.  The over use of adjectives to describe one buddy after another is filler for a story that could be the size of a magazine feature article .<br /><br />And you know how it ends anyway.<br /><br />Read a review and skip the book.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades of Gray<br />After learning about this series on the Today Show a few weeks back, I finally succumbed to the hype.  I couldn't go anywhere without seeing a group of ladies reading the book on their kindles and nooks, in the office waiting or breakroom or smuggling the book with them everywhere they went.  It seemed as if every person at work, Facebook, down the street and around the corner had escaped to the world that was 50 shades of Christian Gray.  So on a Friday night, I downloaded the novel to my kindle and began reading, and before the weekend was up I was at the part of the book where \\"the good stuff\\" begins unfolding.  Fifty shades of Gray is indeed a fast paced addicting novel.  Not to disappoint, it is more than an erotica tale.  Intermingled amongst racy prose, is the mystery of the mercurial Mr. Gray, whose kinky pastimes makes a reader blush, fall in love with him and fear him all at the same time.  Like Anastasia Steele (Ana), you are drawn in by the sex but stay around for the story.  You begin questioning the limits of your own heart and mind and also want to know what makes Mr. Gray so complicated, so cryptic and so controlling.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker<br />E.L. James does not disappoint with the second book of the Fifty Shades trilogy.  Although book two seems to develop at a slower pace than the first, the adventure, mystery and romance continues.  Along with Ana, we learn more about the mercurial Mr. Gray and why he is fifty shades of [messed] up.  To break up the predictable and monotonous struggle of Ana with her subconscious and inner goddess, we are introduced to new characters and plots that threaten Ana and Christian's relationship, but love (no matter how unconventional) seems to prevail.  Although the mannerisms and pastimes of Ana and Christian are rather repetitive, the second book is just as addicting as the first.  There is just something about the continuous evolution of Christian Grey that keeps you captivated and wanting more.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed<br />The plot thickens, in the third installment of the Fifty Shades trilogy.  James doesn't abandon the racy scenes completely, but finally a story is told that has suspense, mystery and several unexpected turn of events.  Unlike some sagas, James brings the story of Christian Grey and his whirlwind romance with Ana Steele full circle, leaving no answers unanswered and with the reader anticipating more.  James should definitely write more books that are as captivating as chapters 17 to 25+ were in Fifty Shades Freed.  Just as the books are a must read, the movie will definitely be worth seeing.
1439153663|5.0|This was an excellent read, especially for anyone who read \\"The Help\\". It was one of those books that was hard to put down.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it its entertaining and kids can play it I'm a kid myself so I know its really fun I play when I free time when I'm not at home or doing homework or studding for test at school
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|I love this movie and the music is beautiful. In spite of comments that it doesn't completely follow the book, I think it is well done and entertaining. I'm not a movie critic; I watch for the enjoyment factor and this met my expectations.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great series!  Can not wait for the next one! If you like Christian from 50 you will LOVE Gideon from this series. Wonderful love story.
B001TODCII|1.0|ok i think i figured it out. its all happening in the main Characters head hes having some kind of violent fantasy . and he's absolutely nuts . half way through i was hoping the main character was wasted or locked up .  for example apparently all the Albanians ( who are the bad guys here) are ex star wars storm troopers/  i mean they fire automatic weapons  and hand guns point blank at lliam and nothing hits him.  is it all a dream or something? or maybe you have to really.. really  suspend belief .also he brutally murders two civilians  in front of police and onlookers in paris and casually walks away . no one says or does anything, no questions.  i mean come on. so he's going into peoples houses murdering them including a police chiefs wife gets in 20 minute gun fights in the middle of paris no cops ever show up. he literally murders dozens of people  over a kidnapping. than you know after murdering dozens of people including a judge and other high ranking french citizens  causally goes to the airport  no questions asked and goes home  i guess asking for realism here is to much.. its got to be a violent fantasy dream of a mad man .i didn't think this movie was well written acted or interesting it lacked complexity and depth as well. the dvd case has more depth  than this piece of garbage

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read a lot.<br /><br />I tend to be critical and underwhelmed with most books.<br /><br />Not this one!  This is seriously one of the best books I've read in a long, long time.  In fact, I'm dead on my feet at work today (typing a review here instead of working) because I literally could not put the book down until I finished it this morning sometime around 3am.  I was waiting for a lull in the action or a break in the intrigue to turn off my kindle and go to sleep.  It never came.  The book just builds and builds and you HAVE to read the next page to find out what might happen next.<br /><br />NOW, stop reading the reviews and just buy this book.  You will NOT be disappointed.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was interesting to learn some of the history of memory and has got me thinking about it from an educator's perspective.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This is my first ADC/AMP and wow what a big difference in sound quality. From my computer to i-pod just makes sound like its supposed to be. I use this ADC/AMP along my Audioengine A5's and wow amazing sound and i haven't even crank it up yet. Im afraid the roof will fall off my house lol. But anyways thanks to Fiio for creating such a great product. You guys rock!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|wish it was more like the original I played like 20 years ago. not bad tho. I play it so it cant be that bad.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|At the start, I was like OMG I rented this?  I looked forward to and rented this?!  Honestly, for probably about the first 20 minutes I felt that way.  I even took a break and came back to it.  I was a teen in the 80's and I'm going to guess we're the ones who are liking this movie the most.  It has that sort of corny, of-its-own-era feel to it that was similar to the styles of films back then.  I didn't get that at first... but slowly my mind and cares drifted away and I began to enjoy.  They could have gotten stronger leads, that's for SURE.  Their voices aren't great and Juliann should stick to dancing, sorry.  TOM CRUISE made this whole movie for me.  Without his character (and getting to see him in this role - wasn't a fan until recently), I think it would have all fallen apart.  It's likely going to be one of those you love it or hate it movies.  I may watch it again to watch Tom.  Sexy as hell in this!
B000051VWW|5.0|Very sultry and soothing. The type of cd that you can play on a cold rainy night with a glass of wine by your side.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As always Ken Follett doesn't use beautiful flowery language yet his story telling is so compelling.  We meet the usual cast of characters who weave in and out of the historic back drop and know the villains and heros.  Yet you just can't put it down.  Soooo frustrating.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Amazing. Although, I wish they could've added more demos and less of the remix songs. Can't stop watching the DVD. So up close and personal which is such an experience as opposed to watching clips of the BAD tour on youtube.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This was the most boring, uninteresting, no-point book I have ever attempted to read.  If this had been J.K . Rowling's first book, she would never have been published.  After 3 attempts to find something redeemable in the story or the characters, I deleted it from my Kindle.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B008MEM24S|4.0|More fun than I expected. Challenging, cute, and smart. Good graphics and great gameplay. Levels are worth replaying for fun if not to improve the score.
1616960922|5.0|After reading [[ASIN:B0099D4KEG Legion]] (reviewed on my website October 19th), I was so impressed that I looked for The Emperor's Soul as soon as I found out it was in bookstores. Although it is definitely a different type of story in a different setting, I found it possibly even more enjoyable. Brandon describes it on his blog as:<br /><br />\\"... my best piece of short fiction to date, and stands as one of the best complete works I've done of any length.\\"<br /><br />I have only read these two novellas of his so far, but if The Emperor's Soul is one of his best, the others have plenty of room to be very good indeed. (Of course, we have to assume that Brandon would not have been tapped as the finishing author for the The Wheel of Time series if he wasn't impressive to begin with!)<br /><br />Going back to the book this post is about, however, I found it to be a very quick read. I think I finished it in about 45 minutes. For such a short book, the story is compellingly complex and developed. The basic plot involves a Forger named Shai, who has been captured and condemned to death for stealing one of the Empire's treasures and replacing it with a fake. Shai specializes in creating forgeries so perfect that they do not even arouse suspicion, but she was betrayed by her partner in this particular heist. (I couldn't help but think of Neal Caffrey from `White Collar' right about this point in the book!) However, her death sentence is suddenly postponed - the Emperor Ashravan is gravely ill, and if he doesn't recover soon, then a large power shift will take place in the current government. Naturally, the Grand Arbiters aren't eager to be ousted, so they contract with Shai to create a duplicate personality for the emperor. Shai isn't enthusiastic about taking on such a huge project, especially within the 98 days provided. But she doesn't have much of a choice, and so sets to work on an escape plan, all while pretending to work on the emperor's new soul.<br /><br />This is not so much a story of `what' as a story of `how' - and it's beautiful. The carefully crafted novella is a work of art much like the pieces it describes, and is well worth your time and effort to read and enjoy. The story is set in one of Mr. Sanderson's previous worlds - that of Elantris, although you don't have to have read that first. I didn't.<br /><br />If you're still not convinced, you can also visit Tor.com and read an excerpt for free to make up your mind.<br /><br />This novella is rated for 10 and up on the Aardvark scale for magic usage and some fight scenes in a fantasy setting. Really, I'm hard-pressed to find anything objectionable in it, but as always, make sure you are the one deciding what your children read. Anyone who enjoys epic fantasy will love this; people who like short stories will love this; people who like fiction set in well-developed fantasy worlds will love this.ot so much a story of `what' as a story of `how' - and it's beautiful.

B004N6369Y|3.0|I usually am a Danielle Steele fan, however this one left me cold.  I enjoyed this as \\"fluff\\" reading. It was a good book to read on an airplane flight. There were no surprises, twists, or turns.  Enjoyable for what it is.  Usually, I like a little more excitement in a book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is an ok app. If you like silly games that are kind of easy but challenging. my daughter enjoy playing them together and seeing who can do better! I like it an recommend it yo others!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This book was a very creative account of the main character going back in time ( a few times) to prevent the assignation of JFK.  Jake gets sidetracked by love and preventing another series of events but he gets close to Oswald and ...Mostly, I liked this book although I found it slow and hokey in parts which made it take a long time to get through.  Mr King is very creative and the book brought back memories of that November day in 1963.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Truly  enjoyed Fifty Shades. Both my daughters recommended I read this.  Which I was surprised I enjoyed it so much since I am not a reader. I had heard so many wonderful comments on the books i thought , why not. It's very detailed on the sexual part but, has a great story. Can't wait to read the next book. I hope it won't be long before it comes out.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Not only was The 100-Year-Old Man a funny little adventure, it was somewhat of a history lesson! Understandably the adventures of Allen with all the world leaders was fiction, but it was a great way to sum up major world events that happened in 100 years! Pee slipper, drug dealers, and elephants oh my!
1451662432|5.0|Total Recall is a pretty apt title that Arnold chose because in the book itself he reveals an interesting psychological detail about himself. He says that he feels his whole life is like a dream just like the character in that film and that he may be woken up at any moment by his mother back in Austria to go to work as a blue collar factory laborer. The fact is that Arnold had a really tough life growing up living in post WW2 poverty with a strict disciplinarian father. From the book it's apparent that insecurity drove him hard. We know him from his film persona but it took an immense amount of drive, intelligence, and ambition to plan his life out like he did. Arnold's life story is an interesting road map to success and despite his personal failures with his marriage he is possibly one of the most intriguing rags to riches stories you'll ever read about. As a child of immigrants myself he is definitely someone worth looking up to because of this. No one is perfect and he made the most out of his opportunity. The book also offers up some insights into the direction America has been headed especially in his run as governor. He acknowledges his own disenchantment with the Republican party which was been swinging far right and also a frustrating ineffectual CA legislature. What's especially interesting is that he was willing to straddle moderate bipartisan lines for the good of the cause rather than hiding behind the party line for personal gain like so many other politicians. He wasn't always successful but it seemed he had the best intentions at heart which at times alienated his own constituents who didn't understand the bigger picture. In the end I was totally surprised by how hard this book was to put down and how intriguing Arnold was as a person.

0345803493|5.0|The book has a way of drawing you in with wondering what will happen next. Although a lot of things happened in quick sequence that does not necessarily happen in real life. I am now starting the third book because I wonder how this will all play out.
B0091V6TF4|3.0|This CD set w/ no Skyfall is a sad lapse in the otherwise class act we've seen surrounding the 50th Anniversary of Bond films. Even the new Bluray box set of Bond films has a slot for the Skyfall disc when it is released in 2013. That's a savvy move & respectful towards those shelling out big bucks for the Bluray box. After all, most Bond aficianados already have all the dvd's anyway, just as we have all the songs in one format or another. Not to include Adele's Skyfall as part of the 50th Anniversary cd is inconsistent w/ the entire 50th Anniversary marketing scheme of the record company & movie people. The whole point of the Skyfall media blitz is to mark 50 yrs. of Bond on film. No Skyfall theme on the 50th Anniversary cd set is inexcusable. Skyfall IS the 50th Anniversary benchmark film.<br />Let's not make excuses about when the song was or wasn't available for cd. We all know it could have been worked into the cd package if all stakeholders came together to make it happen. Capitol rushed it & the result is less than satisfying.
1580495796|5.0|An unabridged version of a classic Holiday novel. While it is still a small novel, at 80 pages, it offered great insight to Dickens storytelling skill. While most people are familiar with the story, this version included new portions that I have not seen in film or television specials. At a great price you can easily purchase this Holiday classic knowing that you are getting the best version possible. There are added benefits to this version. Included are notes, glossary and definitions of terms that are not common in the 21st Century.

B006GM0VZU|5.0|I Love this show !! Not a big Vampire show or movie fan. My daughter told me about this show. So I thought I would at least watch the first episode of the first season. WOW , I Love it !! I couldn't stop watching it. What a Great show. I highly recommend this one !!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everyone kept gushing about this book and how 'I must read it!' Now I wish I could scrub the crap from my head. I am not usually harsh when writing reviews, but after dealing with abusers in my work... I sure as hell don't want to read about one. Big Spoiler ahead!!<br /><br />She FINALLY decides that this man is too screwed up to have as a bed-buddy (let's all face it... that's all he is) and leaves him at the end after he takes her to his special BDSM sex room (she asks him to take her there) where he proceeds to beat her bare behind with a belt so hard that after SIX times she says 'enough is enough, you're too screwed up for me.' Then, she leaves him. I was so happy... this was the first time I wished there wasn't a sequel!! I cannot claim to understand the BDSM world because that is not and never will be my thing, but this was a clear-cut case of abuse in so many ways it sickened me. There was nothing loving or endearing about this book. I understand the man had a seriously screwed up past and was a victim himself, but before he inflicts himself on others, serious counseling is in order. If that's your thing... whatever, but I returned this ebook and will never recommend something like this to anyone I know.

B009AMALLM|3.0|Just saw \\"Paranormal Activity 4\\" aka \\"PA4\\". (THIS IS SPOILER FREE REVIEW) I said this before I will say it again: \\"The Paranormal Activity movies is the new Saw.\\" Yes this series has basically taken over where the Saw series ended.....at least for now. For that each year around Halloween we all go to see the new lately installment of this ongoing franchise. \\"PA4\\" is what you ask for when going into it: getting a unsettling feeling, objects moving in the background, few characters acting strange, jump scares and a big conclusion. Unfortunately, this is the weakest installment in this franchise so far. It brings nothing new to table I hate to say it. It's all the same. It doesn't live up to it's expectations according to the advertisement. The last film really set the bar high and this one was a bit of a letdown. The film does answers some questions, but at the end it's leave you with even more questions to answer. Overall, \\"PA4\\" is an okay installment, but don't expect too much from it. See it if your a hardcore fan. See it on it's first weekend. For everyone else see it as a rental. 3 1/2 out of 5.

The writing is very engaging and easy to follow, and the story line enticing and suspenseful.  Also, I am a native of the Atlanta area, so the geographical references were an interesting plus.  All together a satisfying read!
0545265355|5.0|Every time I read a page I don't realized what would happen each time. This book keeps me up nights and wanting more each time I stopped. Can't wait
B006CBSE86|5.0|Regarding the Album:<br /><br />My first impression was that there was quite a bit of filler on the CD - it turns out that some of the songs are so different from expectations that it takes a few listens to get there.<br /><br />I will say my first impression was wrong - I now like the whole CD, with the possible exception of the long spoken word section in part 3 of Song of Myself.<br /><br />Doesn't matter, because Last Ride of the Day, Ghost River and, well, all the other songs are a thrill to listen to with candor.<br /><br />A Note of Media:<br /><br />The amazon Mp3s aren't there, if you are a quality purist. On a train on headphones, sure, great. For use on a hifi stereo, I would say buy the CD, not the mp3s.<br /><br />While there are claims that the mp3s are encoded at 256 VBR, they are in fact, 256 CBR, with a relatively old/poor codec. A spectral analysis shows a brickwall lowpass at about 15kHz.<br /><br />If you know what that means, you probably care. If you don't you probably don't!<br /><br />In all, Buy and Enjoy.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|This collection was the first I have seen in so long after the first DVD release to introduce all of the deleted scenes and alternate ending. Many of them are available on Youtube now, but this is certainly a collector's item. Disc 3 is really the gem in this set with all the extras, special features and really getting to dive into the making of this film. My father originally gave me this set when it was released years ago but after recently giving it away to a friend I decided I wanted a copy again for myself. For the Titanic collector, this is a perfect gift and a great keepsake.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book.  I thought the first one was entertaining, but this segment gets way more interesting in plot.  If you loved 50 shades you will really enjoy this one.  Looking forward to the third installment.
0123694965|5.0|I've been a game lover since I can remember Jarts, the Atari 2600, even my MARX ELECTRO SHOT SHOOTING GALLERY ARCADE GAME (VINTAGE 1969)! Now as an adult I am in the field of game design producing games for mobile devices. Jesse's book is both extremely informative and equally inspirational. His understanding of process is unmatched. I find myself working on a game concept and turning to his book for \\"advice\\" on how to determine whether or not specific elements/features are working towards a positive end result, and if not how to question myself in order solve these problems in an efficient manner.<br /><br />Whether you're a lone-wolf designer or part of a team this book can definitely benefit anyone who reads it. Thank you Mr. Schell for a wonderful book!
B007THA4FI|4.0|This would be a great book for teens & adults...especially with focus these days on bullying. Book starts slow & there are a lot of characters for the reader to become familiar with (I would suggest simple notes) but I was quickly drawn in to the dynamics at play.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have heard so much about these books that i had to read them.I thought it was about women in their fifty's. was really surprised when I started reading. It is down right rauchy. I'm no prude, but these are the most explicit books i've ever read.Kind of disappointed in them ,being that it's all about kinky sex.
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe this junk is on the best seller list.  I must have put this book down 50 times but had to at least skim through it for a Book Club meeting.  Crap, did I mention the word crap must be repeated over 100 times.  Don't waste your time or money on this crap.  \\"So many books,so little time\\"  There is too much good literature out there and this does not fall into any literary category.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|For one, there's too many ads. And two, what's the point? all the minigames are short and too hard to control. it's sorta entertaining yet I only play for like 15 minutes then get bored, but I like a few of the games. But  what's with having to unlock so many? Not to mention that there's +31. maybe it should give 20 already unlocked.
034580404X|5.0|these books are mind blowing so invigorating ravishing,  well written provocative, what can i say i enjoy these books immensely i wish i was reading on and on loved it......
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|Had high hopes for this movie. Iron man I&II and Thor were quite good with Thor being a little better probably because of Anthony Hopkins playing Thor's Dad. Anyway, expected more of a story buildup and better interaction between the characters. Expected demonstrational reasoning for most of the super heroes for going from disliking each other to working together but didn't see any of that. One minute they hate each other next they are getting along like life-long pals. Heck the Hulk goes from being uncontrollable to becoming almost intellectual in a split second. Bottom line expected more but got another \\"Transformers\\" style movie of smash and smash some more....should be offered free with Prime membership like Thor and Transformers: dark side of moon. Either a lot of \\"story\\" is lying on the cutting room floor or today's audiences don't need much to be wowed.

I didn't get any further into the 60 CD's. Sorry, set returned.<br /><br />Please note: This item was sold by Classical Music Superstore, a third party seller on Amazon - not Amazon direct, and Amazon allowed a full refund.

B001NLKT60|5.0|The characters continue to develop in this second book of the trilogy. Few writers can develop characters like this and also maintain a \\"page turner\\" plot.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This story is romantic and dark at the same time while still being mysterious. The characters are all well supported and the main character Sophia has a serious take on everything. Many people say this story is similar to the twilight series, however I do not agree, the story holds true to its own and I can see why so many people are reading this book. I would recommend anyone to add this book to their library.
B008XG1X18|5.0|have fun going through all the things people put up.<br />love it in general. I mostly have time to look at pins during the night when my baby's are sleaping.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|SAVE YOUR $$$ AND BUY THE ORIGINAL!<br />I have a Lifeproof case and THIS case is NOT it.<br />Take a look at the interior of the case and you'll see the differences.<br />The case did NOT seal properly at all. And that was before I put the phone in. Once I put the phone in, it would not seal all the way around at all. Uneven fit. Poor quality plastic. There are bubbles in the screen. What's up with that??<br />When I got a call, my ringtone sounded \\"tinny\\".<br />Just a sub-par case and nothing like the original. If this were a case of \\"you get what you pay for\\" I might never complain. But at $50, I'll just spend the extra $30 and get the original from Lifeproof directly.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I anxiously awaited this sequel to Bared to You.  It was good--not great--and I think I liked the first book better.  If you like steamy romance novels, they are both worth it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|After hearing rave reviews from several friends, I finally decided to purchase the book for myself. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down as it grabs hold of your attention from page one. The way the book is written only allows for small fractions of the big picture to be revealed in each chapter, encouraging you to keep reading. I highly suggest this book to all readers, even those not typically zombie lovers.
B007THA4FI|1.0|There is no reason to describe every scene, every person, every home or relationship in such base and disgusting terms. PIMPLES AND SWEAT, BELLY BUTTON HAIR AND WIGGLING CONTROSEPTIVES, FILTHY BATHROOMS AND SOILED DIAPERS, OBESE MEN AND SWEARING TEENAGERS ALL MAKE THE BOOK A DISGUSTING READ.I CAN ENJOY A WELL WRITTEN SEX SCENE AS WELL AS THE NEXT BUT THIS BOOK MADE ME CRINGE AS FAR AS A COULD READ IT.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of grey Trilogy was great and I wish there were more of Christian Grey and Anastasia.  However, the author is working on another/different story.  It was very fast reading and I couldn't wait to read the second book after the first and the third after the second.  I finished the three books in about 4 days.  I fell in love this the characters!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Love this book, can't wait until the next one.  Story and setting are spot on and I love the adventure and self descovery in this book.  Sitting on the edge of my seat until the next book comes.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This Movie is KICK ASS!<br />You would think that the main character, Kick Ass, would be the Kick Ass Character.<br />However, as it turns out, Hit Girl is the one who is Kick Ass.<br />Hit Girl made this movie great, and I would recommend this movie to anyone.<br />As a matter of fact I'm about to walk down to the nearest comic book store to see if I can find the comic related to this movie, if there is one.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of things children should not see, or things in which children should be supervised if they are allowed to watch.<br />Overall, even with some of its questionable material, this movie has become my favorite super hero movie!
B006S8QY8K|5.0|I am a huge Richard Gere fan. This movie was funny as well as warm and fuzzy.Although I felt the real star was Jennifer Lopez's butt.

It´s a great book that will teach you everything you need to know to become a good network technician and to pass the exam!!<br /><br />Well written book that wont \\"bore\\" you with useless information and facts.

0307742997|5.0|I try to read books from the NY best seller list. I found Jo nesbo after I read Snowman... Amazing. I love his dark and complicated style of writing. I am in the process of reading his entire Harry Hole series. Try to read them in order and you will not be disaapointed. Right when you start to feel that you have everything figured out he throws another twist !<br />Almost as good and maybe even better than Henning Mankell and his Wallander series... Waiting for Masterpiece to make a series!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I enjoyed every page of it.  The deleted chapter at the end was worth reading too.  Hard to put it down
B005CRQ3LG|5.0|Great illustration and good punch line. My 2 years old daughter enjoyed very much. She wanted me to read over and over again.
0316228532|2.0|I'm not a Harry Potter fan, not having any interest in reading them. Yet with her grand success with the series, and now writing an 'adult' story, I jumped to buy the book the day it came out.<br />I couldn't even finish it, sad to say. Not my style of writing (should have known better I guess) and I found it quite boring. I started flipping through pages until I could flip no more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very relaxing and great for killing some time. An increasing challenge keeps it interesting. Love the simplicity of the game.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Curious as to how they'll do the movie since it's already been confirmed that its in production.  Lots of copyrighted characters and such.  I expect a toooon of cg as well.  Could be wonderfully entertaining though, if done right.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Fantastic it is probably the most advanced technological movie out. I have to add a few speakers to get the 7.1 Dolby affect incredible
B0053O89IS|4.0|Updated November 12, 2012:<br /><br />I love the show but the price still remains too high, especially considering the 8th season has already started. The price has been fluctuating around $39.00, which still comes out to $3.00 an episode. There are some sellers in the Marketplace that have it priced  so that with shipping it will end up at around $29.00. This still leaves the per episode cost higher than individual episode purchase cost! One would think that with the disappointment over the shortened season, along with the fact that the Bones people always seem to wait to release their product until after the next season begins, that they'd price more accordingly (whoever it is that does the pricing!). I'll just keep waiting... That being said, several of the episodes in this shortened season will eventually become some of my all time favorites.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I'll review the 7th season of Bones by stating that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a bit different from previous seasons but, hey, it was Bones! I'll eventually purchase the DVD, but not at the $45 current price. $45 for 13 episodes? $3.50 per episode? Way too much. I waited to purchase the Season 6 DVD until around Christmas and ended up getting it for about $18 and it had about 22 episodes. I guess these DVDs are priced high to begin with because they figure people will pay what they're asking just to get them right away. I'll wait. I took away one star due to price...
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved the kinky fu ery and the struggle for understanding between Fifty Shades and Ana. Will read it again.  I love a good love story with real happiness gained through all the unhappiness we bring on ourselves.
B009OYTOA0|4.0|I had low expectations when I decided to download the pilot episode. After the utter failure of 'The Cape' and other superhero TV shows ruined with poor acting, poor action and plots that could have been written by a 10 year old, who can blame me for expecting Arrow to be another loser. However, I actually came away impressed ... and I am not that easily impressed.<br /><br />First, the selection of Stephen Amell as Green Arrow was excellent. I was worried the role would go to a male model more concerned with being pretty than being a hardened man on a mission. With Stephen Amell as Green Arrow you get a guy who comes off more as an MMA fighter, which makes Arrow so much more believable.  The action scenes are crisp and effective.  Arrow starts out with grit and has an edgy quality that keeps you interested. The plot contains plenty of room for mystery and the dialogue/acting is pretty good. It makes no difference if you are a Green Arrow fan or not, this show is about enjoying a unique action hero.  Maybe a bit too much glorification of 'taking the law into your own hands' but, OK, maybe we'll see if the main character grows beyond this.<br /><br />This appears to be a Canadian production. That may explain why the producers of Arrow seems to be taking more risks in making a DC comic action hero into an actual action hero (and showing a bit more respect for the intelligence of superhero fans young and old).<br /><br />I look forward to seeing more from this series.  One thing the producers could add - a touch of humor.  Nothing sets up an audience for action and dramatic twists than a touch of humor (the Firefly TV show first comes to mind as well and the most recent Avengers film).  And, that's why I went with 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Like superheros? Check out Arrow. Let's see if we can keep this on the air a few years.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I couldn't see this movie in the theaters and I really wanted to.  So I ordered the 3D Blu ray and I must say that after watching the movie once, I was supremely disappointed.  I wrote a scalding review here which I have subsequently removed.  I didn't have nice things to say about this installment.  The problem for me was that the story didn't seem to make much sense: actors where doing things that didn't make much sense and the logic just seemed off.  For a movie of this caliber, the actors, the director, the special effects etc.  It just seemed like the biggest mistake of their careers.<br /><br />Recently I was on a long transatlantic flight and I had some movies loaded onto my ipad.  One of them the classic Dune and another Prometheus (With high anticipation I had loaded Prometheus onto my ipad before seeing).  Long flight, what the hey I played the movie again after watching Dune.<br /><br />It opened my eyes.  The symbolism was all there.  The movie only makes sense when you look at it through the lens of ancient mythology + ancient christian and other belief systems:  sacrifice, rebirth, survival, motherhood, giving birth, circle of life stuff.  Seen through this lens, the movie is brilliant just like Dune.<br /><br />I found myself sad that I had taken Prometheus too literally the first time around and that I didn't give proper credit to the writers, directors, actors, and special effects team.  These people went out of their way to create a beautiful masterpiece here and I didn't even \\"get it\\" at first.  For this I am deeply sorry.<br /><br />Give this movie a chance.  Almost every scene, every line (even the background lines) and little actions by the actors has symbolic meaning.  The robot's behavior is brilliant when you taken into consideration all of the symbolism.<br /><br />The challenge is that because they put so much symbolism into the movie, you wind up with logic gaps.  It sometimes appears that the characters are not making rational decisions.  This is quite literally very true.  That's because there are multiple stories being told here.  So you have to suspend the logic portion to get the broader symbolism aspect of the movie.  Maybe they tried to do too much I don't know.<br /><br />Thank you to Ridley Scott for making this.  Sometimes genius doesn't connect with all of us at once.  I'm happy that I own this movie and I will be studying it for some time - just like Dune.This is quite literally very true.

0307277887|4.0|I'm reviewing the audiobook version here. Darkly Dreaming Dexter introduces Dexter Morgan serial killer of serial killers. To the outside world he is a charming, attractive normal guy with a respectable job with the forensic department. But Dexter (for anyone who hasn't watched the tv show) is constantly battling his \\"dark passenger\\" who dreams of death and can only be assuaged by brutal murder and clinical dismemberment. He was adopted as a young boy by a policeman named Harry who saw Dexter's darkness early on and was able to instill in him a strict code of rules to control his impulses and keep him safe. Now that Harry is dead, Dexter still hears Harry's voice in his head and it almost always keeps him on track.<br /><br />Without boring you with an overlong plot rehash I'll keep it neat and tidy. There's a serial killer on the loose who is chopping up women and leaving their bloodless body parts for Dexter and company to find. Dexter is intrigued by the killer's mastery and finesse and makes it his business to track down the guy. But wait! This killer seems to know Dexter's deepest, darkest secret and begins taunting him. The plot relies heavily on Dexter's ability to sense the other killer and Dexter's \\"dreams\\" of the murders. Whether you buy it or not will depend entirely on just how far you are willing to suspend your disbelief. I went with it. I'm easy sometimes and I really like Dexter.<br /><br />This audiobook was narrated by the author. While he does a decent job voicing Dexter's calm, cool charm and wry sense of humor, he stumbles in a big way with Debra, Dexter's put-upon stepsister who is desperately trying to get promoted and get off  undercover \\"hooker duty\\" so she can do some actual police work. This Debra unpleasantly barks out every line with ear shattering impatience. As much as I enjoy her character because she is cranky and impatient, I cringed whenever she had something to say here. It wouldn't have surprised me if she bit Dexter what with the way she was so overly snarly (she didn't).  However, it's not a guy reading a girl thing that I have a problem with here (for once) because Lindsay does LaGuerta's voice in a smarmy, man-hungry and perfectly fitting way for the power hungry nitwit.<br /><br />Though a story filled with murder and mayhem it surprisingly doesn't dwell on the gory details. Instead it gets into Dexter's head, explaining how he feels when he gives in to his dark passenger (really freaking good). This is something the show is just unable to do and it helps one understand how his mind works. I enjoyed this story and this intimate look into Dexter's head and will continue the series. My only nitpick was Dexter's bad habit of repeating himself. Yeah, yeah so he's unemotional, not human, follows a strict code and is always in control.  I get it. I don't need to be continually banged over the noggin with those facts.  It got tiresome and I felt like the only one he was trying to convince was himself because he was so often NOT in control for most of this book. But other than that complaint, the characters are great and the story zips along at a pace that never loses or bores the crap out of me.e way she was so overly snarly (she didn't).

1401309666|5.0|In his book Googled, Ken Auletta talks about the proliferations of websites and blogs and the reality that most are not that good, but most will never know it because Google organizes everything presenting to users only the top rated sites. (Auletta, 2010)  In FREE, Chris Anderson explains that the price of digital storage is so low as to be nearly free, (Anderson, FREE: How Today's Smartest Businessess Profit by Giving Something for Nothing, 2010) meaning that stores like Amazon can provide exponentially larger selection than even mega stores of brick and mortar like Super Walmarts. The problem is there are too many choices and consumers must weed through a daunting list of options.<br /><br />Amazon uses product reviews and product rankings to establish order in this chaos. In virtually any category, Amazon has a top 100. So, given any product, a user can find its ranking based on dozens to 100s of thousands of reviews, then can choose the option of clicking on the 100 products in that category, which will be displayed starting with #1 first.<br /><br />In Crowdsourcing, Jeff Howe (Page 280) uncovers a counter-intuitive fact that while any given single individual in a crowd may have a percentage chance of getting a wrong answer, the larger the number polled, the more likely the majority answer is to be correct. Jeff notes this is how major problems can be solved using crowds much more effectively than using specialists. (Howe, 2009) In Cognitive Surplus, Clay Shirky expounds on this, noting that businesses can solve major issues much more economically by tapping into the crowd, because maintaining a specialist and all their research equipment is pricy, while buying the best answer to a problem presented on the web can be purchased at a fraction of the cost. (Shirky, Cognitive Surplus: How Technology Makes Consumers into Collaborators, 2010)<br /><br />If Amazon were to attempt, central government and KGB-style to hire a group of experts to rank all their products and tell us what were best, the final product would not have the quality the current ranking does and it would be rather like being told what is best, rather than democratically selecting the best products. The current system amounts to a product election system.<br /><br />Historically, book reviews were the realm of so-called professionals, rather like publishing and authoring books. However, as Clay Shirky notes on page 55 of Here Comes Everybody, \\"Everyone is a media outlet.\\" He goes on to note that our social (media) tools remove older obstacles to public expression, and thus remove the bottlenecks that characterized mass media. The result is mass amateurization of effort previously reserved for media professionals.\\"  He even questions the whole definition of profession and professional. In a world where so many people do things as a hobby in their off-time which are competing with professionals, such as Amazon's books and product reviews. Shirky says mass amateurization breaks professional categories. Discussing solely journalism, but this applies to all publishing, including the publishing of reviews, Shirky says on page 73, \\"Journalistic privilege is based on the previous scarcity of publishing. Now that scarcity is gone. Facing the new abundance of publishing options, we could just keep adding to the list of possible outlets - newspapers and television, and now blogging and video blogging and podcasting and so on.\\" (Shirky, Here Comes Everybody:The Power of Organizing Without Organizations, 2008) To which can be added Amazon's book reviews and product reviews.  Everyone is welcome to make an account and start reviewing.<br /><br />Amazon is a huge website, although not the only huge site. Most USG agency websites are huge and many corporate sites are equally daunting. During a survey last year of the US Air Force main website, users' number one complaint was the inability to navigate the site intuitively. In this, intuitive navigation, Amazon's website suite has achieved remarkably high success.<br /><br />If USG agency websites allowed users to rank content and then organized that content according to rank on a top 100 site by category, the sites may be more user friendly, easy to navigate and informative. For younger groups, this is particularly true of photo and videos by category. However, this categorical ranking of media may be very useful for traditional mass media looking for stock art. One of the functions such sites serve is to provide trustworthy, easy access to basic institutional information.<br /><br />Self-Publishing<br /><br />In addition to contributing paragraphs of information on products, Amazon has opened the door for people to participate in their empire by publishing books in print, digital or audio formats. In Crowdsourcing, Jeff Howe says the most effective way to be successful today is to allow people to carve out a space on your empire where they can do what they want. (Howe, 2009) In Cognitive Surplus, Clay Shirky talks about how a 40-hour work week and an abundance of education have combined to give lots of people with great knowledge and skills a lot of free time that they often invest in production, not just play. (Shirky, Cognitive Surplus: How Technology Makes Consumers into Collaborators, 2010) Karl Marx noted that the objective of labor for most people is the idea of producing something unique, something that allows a sense of pride. (Marx, Engels, & Tucker, 1978)<br /><br />Not only has Amazon given people an option to produce and the ability to participate in the Amazon empire, they are reshaping the book industry.  During last month's announcement of new products, Jeff Bezos triumphantly announced that 27 of Amazon's top 100 best-selling books are published by independent authors. This looks like the death of traditional publishers. (Calvin, 2012)<br /><br />Each of these authors has the option to sell books free 5 days out of every 90 and can sell audible versions for free all month long. In his book FREE, Chris Anderson notes on page 161, \\"the enemy of the author is not piracy, but obscurity. Free is the lowest cost way to reach the most number of people, and if the sample does the job, some will buy the `superior' version.\\" (Anderson, FREE: How Today's Smartest Businessess Profit by Giving Something for Nothing, 2010)<br /><br />Independent author Adele Marie Crouch has discovered that free versions of her eBooks drive up sales of the print on demand books, which are illustrated bilingual children's books in a range of dozens of languages. Increasingly, the revenues for her small business, Creations by Crouch, come from print sales, while the eBooks versions are cheaper and are often used more as a sample by users than the final product they would read to their children. (Crouch, 2012)<br /><br />Other websites like YouTube and WordPress also help people upload content and share with the world. This business model is remarkably successful. The question becomes how could USG agencies use this structure to encourage participation in static, bureaucratic websites? Some have tried small projects encouraging photo uploads from a competition like a marathon.<br /><br />Volunteerism<br /><br />In addition to the other means by which people can participate, for bragging rights or money, Amazon has a purely altruistic option - formatting and uploading IPR-free, public domain books.  In Cognitive Surplus, Clay Shirky asks why people would spend their weekends and evenings participating digitally in building an empire they have no stake in and the answer is pretty much the same reason as they volunteer. They feel good about what they are doing. They want to contribute to something they believe in. (Shirky, Cognitive Surplus: How Technology Makes Consumers into Collaborators, 2010)<br /><br />Many of these books are edited after they are published. It's part of a new trend that Clay Shirky describes in Here Comes Everybody on page 81, which he calls,publish, then filter. \\"The media landscape is transformed, because personal communications and publishing, previously separate functions, now shade into one another. One result is to break the older pattern of professional filtering of the good from the mediocre before publication; now such filtering is increasingly social, and happens after the fact.\\" (Shirky, Here Comes Everybody:The Power of Organizing Without Organizations, 2008)<br /><br />While editing books historically was done extensively before printing, now there is no need. A new edition can be loaded onto the Print on Demand, Kindle and audible audio books within one hour and that covers all three formats.<br /><br />The debate about professionalism, which is to say quality still rages on about these kind of volunteer operations despite the fact that the number one server software in the world, Apache, is not made by a company, but rather a loosely connected group of volunteers.  On page 9 of his book Crowdsourcing, Jeff Howe notes, \\"From the Linux Operating System to Apache server software to the Firefox web browser, much of the infrastructure of the information economy was built by teams of self-organized volunteers. (This is) a model of production that is rapidly migrating to fields far and wide.\\" (Howe, 2009)<br /><br />In a similar move, crowd sourcing based on people's altruistic motives, the State Department deputized college students as virtual diplomats, and they became particularly useful as text message translators during the Haiti hurricane and flooding crisis.  Since most of the military and other USG agencies have large communities of retired, spouse and dependent communities, the challenge is how to engage them as part of the public web structure in a useful way that allows them in, but protects against IT invasion of malicious types.<br /><br />It seems logical that most USG websites could use blogging technology to allow users to comment on any product on the site, including articles, photos, even biographies and fact sheets. It might be possible to use a Facebook login to link the comments users post on government websites to their social media and their microblogging daily entries.<br /><br />Social Media<br />Like Buttons on Everything<br /><br />\\"Facebook's Like button, introduced in April 2010, has already been added by more than two million distinct websites. The Like button allows Facebook's more than 600 million users, with one click, to express approval of companies, organizations, articles or ideas,\\" Likable Social Media author Dave Kerpen explains. (Kerpen, 2011)  While Amazon was an early adopter, so too the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and a few more than a dozen other USG agencies, including, of course, NASA.<br /><br />Dave explains that the value of the FB Like button is that it expands into the hundreds the basic, traditional advertising form of word of mouth. \\"Word-of-mouth marketing has always been considered the purest and best form of marketing and social media has continued to prove that fact in many ways.\\" (Kerpen, 2011)<br /><br />Surprisingly, a news article listed Amazon as a `late bloomer' with regard to the Social Media scene, but this referred to their entrance into paid advertising on Social Media, including Facebook, not so much to their employment of Social Media. On the contrary, Amazon seems like an early adopter and innovator in many of the Social Media applications. In a Business Insider article, Jim Edwards ranks Amazon #24 of out of the top 30 spenders on Social Media advertising. (Edwards, 2012)<br /><br />Cross Platform Integration<br /><br />Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon has also used crowd sourcing to create and maintain the best online compendium of movie trivia in the U.S. on IMDB, one of the amazingly high ranking websites in the Amazon enterprise. He just announced that this information will be immediately visible while watching Amazon streaming movies via a new tool called \\"movie X-ray.\\" (Swedlow, 2012)<br /><br />This is very much in keeping with the concepts in What Would Google Do and In the Plex. (Levy, 2011) Companies like Google and Amazon are a new hybrid of non-profit and business in that they give away a lot of services for free, like search results, supporting their business by seeking revenues from other areas. It's these free services that drive traffic. As Dan Ariely says<br />In Predictably Irrational, free is not just a price, it's an emotional hot button. (Ariely, 2010)<br /><br />There's no doubt that government website could benefit from cross platform integration, the question is how and how much. Given today's Congress and budgetary constraints contracting out to hand construct specialized software isn't likely. There doesn't appear as yet to be an open source software that promotes cross platform integration. Some Social Media provide this kind of resource, including posting YouTube or UStream videos, Facebook comments and similar types of free cross platform integration. These would require only the relatively low entry price of a basic knowledge of HTML to integrate the code the various sites produce for this purpose.<br /><br />Sharing Activity Via Social Media<br />Amazon.com has had the ability to share purchases for years, but has only just recently added the ability to share product reviews.  Now, upon completion of either of these actions, the website asks if you would like to share this activity on Facebook.<br /><br />This is a simple function that could easily be added to most USG websites and has long been a part of the US Air Force enterprise. While the Army offers the option to Like an article or share it on Google, they don't have the full tool that the US Air Force uses which allows readers to share the product via 328 options. The U.S. Marines, U.S. Department of Defense, DHS, and the White House also use the same function as the U.S. Air Force. U.S. Navy.mil has only the choice to share by email. Nasa.gov allows only to tweet the story, like it or Google + it. However, most executive branch websites like USAID.gov have no share options. This seems like a simple addition to most any USG website that would allow them to better distribute information to a broader base.<br /><br />The Long Tail<br /><br /> In his book, the Long Tail, Chris Anderson notes that Amazon can carry millions of books, movies or music tracks compared to 100s of thousands by any given brick and mortar store because bytes take up limited storage, alleviating traditional retails storage problems. He further notes that even items on the bottom of the popularity list never reach zero sales. There's always a small demand. This demand, in the aggregate makes revenues as he notes the bulk of Amazon's revenues comes from the bottom 50% of the items listed. The days of Casey Cassem's Top 40 are gone. People are different, and they have niche interests which for the first time in history, they can indulge in. (Anderson, The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More, 2008)<br /><br />Amazon Allows Anyone to Publish - Even to Niche' Audiences<br />At the heart of crowd sourcing is allowing people to use your website to make their own products. (Howe, 2009) This is where most USG websites fail, in part due to security concerns. Amazon has created numerous ways in which people can participate in the Amazon empire. Among the most popular is the one that pays them. No reject letters from traditional publishers. One of the challenges is quality. Many people complain that the independently published books lack the copy editing that was common among more traditional publishing.<br /><br />An interesting trend, traditional publishers are rushing to publish on Kindle and many of them are not formatted well leaving fragmented lines or typos. Many of the independent authors have no copy editors and the end result is one of near equal mediocrity. This isn't good for the industry. Despite these pitfalls, Jeff Bezos announced that people who own Kindles are reading exponentially more than they did before. He suggests this is because the Kindle or audible books read to the reader while they drive, or cook or clean, thereby increasing reading time.  Additionally, he announced 27 of the top 100 best selling eBooks on Amazon are published by Amazon as independent authors. (Calvin, 2012)<br /><br />The challenge then for USG websites is how to incorporate the crowd into the website. Amazon uses a login base with which users create their own accounts. USG IT teams are reluctant to consider this option as it opens up possible in-roads for hackers.  USG websites are more frequently targeted by hackers for bragging rights or those with political motives. As such, security on these sites is challenging. However, a huge and famous site like Amazon.com almost certainly has similar security concerns.<br /><br />A relatively small, non-government site allows photographers to promote the U.S Park Service: [...] It would be great to see a branch of the US government do something similar to promote that branch. This site include by a Photo of the Day, Week, Month and Year selected by voters. This would be an excellent option to move USG websites into the future.<br /><br />Amazon Offers 1,000s More Music Tracks and Movies - All Digital<br /><br />\\"Perhaps the most prevalent e-commerce site is Amazon.com. Amazon.com was founded by Jeff Bezos to sell books on the Web. Since then, Amazon has expanded to sell a wide variety of services in the categories of books, movies, music, games, electronics and computers, home, garden, tools, groceries, health and beauty, toy, kids and babies, clothing, shoes, jewelry, sports, automotive, and industrial. All items are shipped directly to the purchaser.\\" (Schneider & Evans, 2012)<br /><br />Amazon can Carry a Range of Audio Programs<br />An average brick and mortar music or book store can carry 100s of thousands of products  whereas a digital store can offer millions. The difference in scale is radical. \\"To offer even more variety, companies such as Amazon have expanded to `virtual inventory' - products physically , located in a partner's warehouse, but displayed or sold on Amazon's site. Today, its Marketplace program aggregates such distribution inventory, products held at the very edge of the network by thousands of small merchants. Cost to Amazon: zero.\\"<br />For Amazon, this includes private book owners who can sell their used products online either with a free account for people with less than 40 items to sell or a professional account for which they can list an unlimited number of books, books on CD, books on audio cassette, but must pay a monthly premium.<br /><br />\\"Digital inventory - think iTunes - is the cheapest of all. We've already seen the effects of the switch from shipping plastic discs to streaming megabits has on the music industry; soon the same will come to movies, video games, and TV shows. News has left the paper age, podcasting is challenging radio, and who knows you may be reading this book on a screen. Eliminating atoms or the constraints of the broadcast spectrum is a powerful way to reduce costs, enabling entirely new markets of niches.<br /><br />The U.S. Air Force has already started streaming its band performances of IPR free sheet music on [...] The White House routinely streams live broadcasts of the President's speeches and the State Department does similar website broadcasts of speeches by the Secretary of State or other high officials. While some USG websites are taking advantage of the digital capabilities that Amazon.com has already capitalized on, there's more they could do. Live video feeds from Yellowstone are available online and are impressive. The challenge is to push down to all USG websites this kind of innovation and to include a full range of digital video, audio, gaming and podcasting options for all.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />Comparing the top producing commercial sites to the top producing government sites, it seems there are a lot of similarities. And while there are a lot of government websites that are not on board with the newest and latest technologies, there are similarly a lot of commercial websites that are still lagging behind. Comparing all government sites to the #1 eCommerce website, Amazon.com, in the United States seems unjust. It seems more logical to compare top performers to top performers, and at the top, they seem to be relatively similar in their creativity. While it seems DOD, NASA and the White House are ahead of the pack, while State, City and small agencies are lagging, very possibly due to manpower and budgetary constraints, as well as the already mentioned security concerns.<br /><br />Bibliography<br />Anderson, C.

(Howe, 2009) This is where most USG websites fail, in part due to security concerns. Amazon has created numerous ways in which people can participate in the Amazon empire. Among the most popular is the one that pays them. No reject letters from traditional publishers. One of the challenges is quality. Many people complain that the independently published books lack the copy editing that was common among more traditional publishing.<br /><br />An interesting trend, traditional publishers are rushing to publish on Kindle and many of them are not formatted well leaving fragmented lines or typos. Many of the independent authors have no copy editors and the end result is one of near equal mediocrity. This isn't good for the industry. Despite these pitfalls, Jeff Bezos announced that people who own Kindles are reading exponentially more than they did before. He suggests this is because the Kindle or audible books read to the reader while they drive, or cook or clean, thereby increasing reading time.  Additionally, he announced 27 of the top 100 best selling eBooks on Amazon are published by Amazon as independent authors. (Calvin, 2012)<br /><br />The challenge then for USG websites is how to incorporate the crowd into the website. Amazon uses a login base with which users create their own accounts. USG IT teams are reluctant to consider this option as it opens up possible in-roads for hackers.  USG websites are more frequently targeted by hackers for bragging rights or those with political motives. As such, security on these sites is challenging. However, a huge and famous site like Amazon.com almost certainly has similar security concerns.<br /><br />A relatively small, non-government site allows photographers to promote the U.S Park Service: [...] It would be great to see a branch of the US government do something similar to promote that branch. This site include by a Photo of the Day, Week, Month and Year selected by voters. This would be an excellent option to move USG websites into the future.<br /><br />Amazon Offers 1,000s More Music Tracks and Movies - All Digital<br /><br />\\"Perhaps the most prevalent e-commerce site is Amazon.com. Amazon.com was founded by Jeff Bezos to sell books on the Web. Since then, Amazon has expanded to sell a wide variety of services in the categories of books, movies, music, games, electronics and computers, home, garden, tools, groceries, health and beauty, toy, kids and babies, clothing, shoes, jewelry, sports, automotive, and industrial. All items are shipped directly to the purchaser.\\" (Schneider & Evans, 2012)<br /><br />Amazon can Carry a Range of Audio Programs<br />An average brick and mortar music or book store can carry 100s of thousands of products  whereas a digital store can offer millions. The difference in scale is radical. \\"To offer even more variety, companies such as Amazon have expanded to `virtual inventory' - products physically , located in a partner's warehouse, but displayed or sold on Amazon's site. Today, its Marketplace program aggregates such distribution inventory, products held at the very edge of the network by thousands of small merchants. Cost to Amazon: zero.\\"<br />For Amazon, this includes private book owners who can sell their used products online either with a free account for people with less than 40 items to sell or a professional account for which they can list an unlimited number of books, books on CD, books on audio cassette, but must pay a monthly premium.<br /><br />\\"Digital inventory - think iTunes - is the cheapest of all. We've already seen the effects of the switch from shipping plastic discs to streaming megabits has on the music industry; soon the same will come to movies, video games, and TV shows. News has left the paper age, podcasting is challenging radio, and who knows you may be reading this book on a screen. Eliminating atoms or the constraints of the broadcast spectrum is a powerful way to reduce costs, enabling entirely new markets of niches.<br /><br />The U.S. Air Force has already started streaming its band performances of IPR free sheet music on [...] The White House routinely streams live broadcasts of the President's speeches and the State Department does similar website broadcasts of speeches by the Secretary of State or other high officials. While some USG websites are taking advantage of the digital capabilities that Amazon.com has already capitalized on, there's more they could do. Live video feeds from Yellowstone are available online and are impressive. The challenge is to push down to all USG websites this kind of innovation and to include a full range of digital video, audio, gaming and podcasting options for all.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />Comparing the top producing commercial sites to the top producing government sites, it seems there are a lot of similarities. And while there are a lot of government websites that are not on board with the newest and latest technologies, there are similarly a lot of commercial websites that are still lagging behind. Comparing all government sites to the #1 eCommerce website, Amazon.com, in the United States seems unjust. It seems more logical to compare top performers to top performers, and at the top, they seem to be relatively similar in their creativity. While it seems DOD, NASA and the White House are ahead of the pack, while State, City and small agencies are lagging, very possibly due to manpower and budgetary constraints, as well as the already mentioned security concerns.<br /><br />Bibliography<br />Anderson, C.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Was interested in reading this book after learning about the authors work with children aging out of the foster care system in the United States through her organization Camellia Network.<br />The book definitely did not disappoint. Victoria's character learns the forgiveness and love of a family and the truth that we are all flawed in our own ways but still deserving of love.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I used to be into PC gaming since the days of Doom, but a few years ago switched over to Xbox for the simplicity.  Well, I've switched back and wanted to try something more than a keyboard.  It was between this and then Razer Nostromo, I had read such good reviews of both that I had a hard time deciding.  I have large hands and decided to go with the logitech as it seemed like it would fit me better.  I'm very happy with my decision.  My hand fits great on the pad and is much more comfortable than using a keyboard.  I have great access to all of the keys and love the thumb stick and buttons!  I really thought that thumb stick would be a waste of space, but have found I rely on that as much or more than on most of the other keys.  It is great to quickly flick one of four ways to switch weapons or perform a task.  The only thing I don't like on the thumb stick is that the push straight down is a little stiff and hard to do with out pushing it in a direction as well.  I've ended up not using that one particular programmable feature and haven't noticed the lack since there are so many other keys.  My thumb easily controls 6 functions that are so easy to reach and use that I can't imaging not having that ability again.  The software is pretty easy to use as well.  I've very happy with this Gameboard!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I enjoyed the Rocky movies when I was younger and was thrilled to find out that one of our GrandDaughters is wanting the Rocky movies so we bought her a set from Amazon and are very happy with the time it took to receive product and the product itself,Thank-You!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I am normally a big fan of Tim Burton and his movies but, Dark Shadows was a little too bizarre even for me. The first half of this movie is very well done and enjoyable. The Collins family is unusual but intriguing. The star of this movie, Barnabus Collins, is a womanizer that seduced the wrong woman. Because he did not love her she turned him into a vampire. Barnabus is a very unique character because, as the viewer, you can't quite tell if he's likable. The love he has for his family is commendable but, I don't think it excuses him for the way he treats women.<br /><br />The end of this movie was beyond bizarre and it felt disconnected with the rest of the movie. I don't think I would watch this movie again. If you watched the original Dark Shadow series, this might be the movie for you. If not, I would recommend saving your money and waiting until it's on TV.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I went in to this not expecting much since it's another rehash of the thousands of games out there where you swap items in order to make a row of matching pictures, but I have to say, this one surprised me.<br /><br />The quality of this game is very high, both for the graphics (effects too) and the ease of use/control. The developers did a great job with this one. I was also pleased with the length of the game. I can't be 100% sure without looking but I want to say it's somewhere around 40 levels, but possibly more. The game is split up in to \\"cities\\" which consist of 8 levels each -- 7 levels of the matching game and then 1 where you place the objects you \\"won\\" in the previous 7 levels in to a scene where they belong.<br /><br />The later levels are actually pretty darn hard so this should keep anyone busy for a long time. There are also some creative \\"tools\\" you can get along the way through the game to help you out. For example, one is a lightning bolt that allows you to \\"zap\\" a certain picture and it will eliminate all of the items on the screen that are the same as the one you clicked. Sure, that sounds like it would make things easy but it's not something that removes the challenge from the game at all.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good game.

B0096DFBZQ|5.0|This is a cute racing game with a lot of options and a great challenge.<br />It is true that it takes a while to get used to all those features but just actually read the help.<br />While racing, dont miss the circles on the ground - they give you a speed boost.<br />And of course YES, you can activate tilt control in the options - the two arrows simply add to the tilt control if you need to slide around bends fast.<br />Sometimes you can take a shortcut - a small dust lane - but I recommend staying on the main track.<br />With tilt AND the arrows you shouldn't have to use the brake pedal very often. Game on :)
0375507256|3.0|Just finished reading, and I can't say I really enjoyed it.  Yes, David Mitchell must have spent a heck of a lot of time studying a plethora of different topics/languages/dialects to make this book work, and I can definitely respect that - except it sort of doesn't work.  Everyone knows the book hints at reincarnation - but it is just that, hints.  It seems like the characters seem to have traits that resemble others and then as soon as it is mentioned or introduced (to introduce/connect the next short story), the traits are dismissed.  Millions of people for thousands of years have believed in nirvana and reincarnation - and yet of all these characters, no one here does.  Or do they?  It is very frustrating/confusing.  So the book is saved by the stories one chooses to like, in the end - which for me were Frobisher/Sixsmith, Rey and Cavendish, and you really only care about the characters you want to care about - which leaves you unsatisfied, somehow.  Wasn't expecting a happy ending - but sort of expecting some enlightenment (no pun intended).

B005LAJ1O0|2.0|I bought this series with much happy expectation because of all of the 5-star reviews I saw on Amazon. In my first review I gave the series 1 star. A number of commenters insisted that I give it a second look because they were sure I had missed some of the merits of the show. So I watched the entire series a second time and have rewritten my review.<br />I strongly dislike the series for three reasons:<br />1) There are far too many pieces and parts of many other movies, television shows, popular novels, infamous serial killer histories and related well-known events. These are far more extensive than homage shout outs like Iron Man referring to Thor as \\"Point Break\\" in \\"The Avengers\\". In many cases whole plot lines are lifted. It gives me the impression that instead of coming up with their own creative presentation, the writers chose to take the easy way out by using what others have done. (The Offal in my title refers to the eating of raw organ meat by a pregnant woman in this series...just like \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and indeed she does give birth to the antichrist! Help!) Even passages of music that have been made famous in other movies such as Kill Bill and Bram Stoker's Dracula were incorporated, which were sometimes so inappropriate that I had to shake my head and laugh in disbelief. One commentator said I fail to understand pastiche. Maybe. If this is pastiche, I think it is very poorly done. In particular, lifting so many actual events specific to the Columbine Massacre and adding them to the story was very offensive. The writers didn't have to do it that way. I would hate to be a friend or relative of those victims and stumble across this series. But hey, anything for a buck, right?<br />2) The story is delivered like a madman firing a machine gun. There is no depth and no chance to build the tension necessary in great horror because the writers and directors are busy cramming every story line, murder, attack, sexual liaison, rape, bloodletting and outrage they can think of into every episode. Thus, instead of experiencing horror, the viewer becomes numb. Half way through the series there are at least 20 ghosts in the house and twice that many murders. It actually becomes boring due to overkill. Instead of adding dozens of story lines that go nowhere, they should have carried a few story lines to their conclusions. It would have made the characters far more interesting. I thought perhaps they intended to do this in the second season but no; the second season is in a new location and a different era.<br />3) I don't think that it is asking too much to expect that a series called American Horror Story would scare you at some points. It is the way the product was described and I was ready for a good ghost story but I wasn't ever frightened or even surprised throughout all 12 episodes. I have since noticed that even in the 4 and 5-star reviews, many people say that the show does not frighten them. That may be fine for some viewers but for me it is a major ding.<br />I can't blame the actors or actresses. They must work with what they are given and they all seem to do the best they can. And certainly the project is well-funded with many attractive sets and costumes. On second viewing those assets were more obvious to me and therefore I have rewritten my review with an added star. I personally dislike giving an item a poor review but this is as high as I can go.<br />That being said, if I had it to do over again, I would not have blown $35 on this series. I have since learned that many professional reviewers have panned this series and I shall check with them from now on before I make a purchase sight unseen. I recommend that if you are curious, you watch the reruns and save your money.can think of into every episode. Thus, instead of experiencing horror, the viewer becomes numb.

0439023483|5.0|Review of The Hunger Games<br />In Suzanne Collins's fast paced book, The Hunger Games, you will feel as if you are alongside Katniss Everdeen as she struggles through poverty, oppression, and potential death. The Hunger Games take place in the country of Panem, a place recently known as North America. Panem is made up of a wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding poor districts. The games serve as a punishment to the districts for their attempt to overthrow the wealthy capitol. Through the violence and brutality in the games, the districts are reminded that the Capitol has ultimate control over them.<br />\\"Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.\\"<br />As Katniss hears the announcer's sarcastic welcome at the reaping, an event held to house the annual lottery, she thinks about the possibility of being chosen as a tribute in the Hunger Games. Both Katniss and her younger sister Primrose meet the requirements to have their names entered into the lottery. Her biggest fear becomes reality when Prim's name is called to be in the games. Without hesitation, Katniss runs to the front of the crowd and volunteers to compete in Prim's place. Katniss will be forced to compete against a boy and girl from each district, ages twelve to eighteen, in an arena where they will fight to the death.<br />The Hunger Games is televised and required for all of the members of Panem to watch to serve as a constant reminder of the Capitol's power. Many families are forced to watch as their loved ones are brutally murdered. Gamemakers virtually design every detail of the games, from the number of weapons in the arena to the weather conditions, is under their control. The Gamemakers decide on new rules for the tributes to follow unexpectedly, one of which has a large impact on Katniss and the male tribute from her district, Peeta Mellark.<br />Throughout the Hunger Games, the role of both rich and poor people and their influences on society as a whole are illustrated, especially the economic influences on the society of Panem. Each district specializes in one industry that contributes to the Capitol. Throughout the story, the power of the Capitol is challenged by the tributes, sometimes unintentionally. The people of the districts take note of their rebellious acts and also begin to question the Capitol's authority.  The role of the poor district people on the country of Panem becomes more significant as the story progresses, leaving readers intrigued by the acts of courage demonstrated.<br />Rue, a twelve year old contestant that reminds Katniss of her younger sister, Prim, is shot in the chest with an arrow during the games. Although Katniss is expected to fight the young girl, she does the unexpected. Katniss sits by her and sings as Rue takes her final breaths. Katniss shows compassion by burying her in a bed of flowers, an act that the capitol views as rebellious. Through Katniss' brave actions, the people of Panem begin to idolize her. As the Capitol recognizes Katniss' popularity, they attempt to kill her by worsening her conditions in the games.<br /> \\"As I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that's the only source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee drawing us in to fight.\\"<br />Katniss faces many obstacles during the games. She suffers through sleep deprivation, severe burns, stings, cuts, dehydration and deafness. Katniss is forced to form alliances with other tributes when the conditions become too bad to continue alone. Throughout the games, Katniss and Peeta begin to develop feelings for each other. Katniss struggles with her feelings towards Peeta as she questions whether or not the love she feels towards him is only an allusion. The tributes begin to make choices that will reflect their personality to the district people in order to gain popularity. Katniss is confronted with a difficult decision when Peeta is unable to keep up with her. Isit better to save herself or help Peeta?<br />There is never a dull moment in this story of survival and perseverance. Katniss is faced with many decisions involving the ones she cares for the most and when to stand up for what she believes. Who will come out of the Hunger Games alive? Will the people of Panem follow in the footsteps of Katniss and go against the capitol? You will not be able to put this book down as you go on the journey through the Hunger Games with Katniss.

B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowling's transition from wizard world into the realm of a small town abutting a larger one, set against the backdrop of local government, with the hopes, dreams and dark desires of people who could be our neighbours, is at times akin to an uncomfortable train ride. The scenery slips by giving us a glimpse of rural beauty, counterpointed with images of despair, poverty, addiction, and petty politics portrayed by the sort of characters not created from dark magic, but the grittiness of contemporary life in rural England. There is little that is mystical in Casual Vacancy apart from the inner workings of teenage minds heavy with hormones on the voyage of discovery to adulthood. And with the solidity of rolling stock on steel track, there are lurches and resonances along the way.<br /><br />The book is a journey for both author and reader; for one it is a trip to the countryside and an immersion into lives behind curtained windows we might not otherwise glimpse; and the other, an opportunity to be thankful for our own life and all its good and bad lest we were to be doomed to walk in the shoes of any of its characters. As in life it is in fiction, it's not the destination that's important, but the experience of getting there.

B0098VYCCE|3.0|The movie was a wee bit on the disappointing side - especially with all the media coverage concerning Kristen Stewart's adulterous affair, with the Director, a married man.  Last time I checked the 10 Commandments and the New Testament were still \\"against\\" adultry.  My suggestion, for Rupert would be stick to the things that will improve the career choice he made (to be a Director) and give up on chasing women because he thinks the grass might be greener on the other side or that he is seen as a \\"catch\\".  Please!  What mirror has been talking to Rupert?  I've been on the other side, of the grass, - it is not greener, never is and ends up hurting more people due to our own personal selfish desires.  My prayers are with him, his wife and child/children that they can heal, forgive and move on.  Kristen will not remain popular if she hurts Rob again!!  BTW Kristen, you didn't pull the British accent off like Rupert told you - men will say anything to get what they want.  Lesson #1.

B00846REIS|3.0|I admit the editing and the writing without the irritating repetition of words found in Fifty shades of grey (FSOG), which makes this book seem more readable and less cringable. But the similarities is too much between this two books, although the intensity of the plot and the sex scenes is seriously lacking here. The sex was alright but the problem between this two tortured soul and the people they hang around with, is not that intense enough, though more realistic than FSOG.<br /><br />Christian's reason of preference for brunettes (same as Gideon, although author never mention why - yet in the first book) is quite appalling. I basically lost my appetite while eating and reading FSOG that Christian screw those woman because they look like his mother. Like seriously he needs more than therapist's help. The BDSM is quite intense there, with alot of introduction of the classical music (i'm never fond of classical music, i still do not like it, lol, but boy oh boy, it makes me look at classical music in a different way now, and pop music, etc) It's hard to read and forget about FSOG because there are alot of references, which in our lives we will come in contact with, i'm hinting at the music, don't just think about sex and the BDSM, lol.<br /><br />But, just for some reason, i finish this book faster than FSOG. I guess the dragging and the too intense storyline (sometimes it's not good to have intensity everyday, lol)and i find the storyline though mild, still had its impact on me. I am also pondering how do two tortured and sexual abuse people come to embrace and love one another's imperfection, past wounds and move on with their life, coming to terms with their hurt, anguish, pain and confusion about why things happen the way it did. Everyone is imperfect in their own way but when it comes with extra emotional baggage or even sort of burden, how do one slowly learn to let go and face the past along with the present and walks to the future together? I feel for bothGideon and Eva, they fight hard for their happiness, something they both deserved very much as any human being to be happy, to be truly blessed in a relationship but couldn't ignore that there are certain things that the past won't let them do that and when one tries to buried and one tries to dig and slowly facing it, it starts to burn them out too. Eva seem the slightly stronger type here, making Gideon face on his past and also keep pushing, not only him but herself to believe and trust in what their relationship means for the both of them. That makes this story really intriguing.<br /><br />As the rest of the reviewers mentioned, the ending is quite abrupt. It should have make it seem like it is going to be continued...but it seem too rush, perhaps making it for the deadlines or something?<br /><br />Overall, i kind of like this mild, sometimes slow and boring plot. I need to read the rest of the books in this series to know if it started out like FSOG, the first book is boring but still FSOG entertain me with the sex scenes, this one is on the psychological level. Second and third is much better for FSOG, hopefully so for this novel!

I can't say I hated it, but just like the first book, it's not the best thing that I've ever read. I wouldn't recommnend people rush out and purchase it...unless it's on clearance for like $1.00. I started reading book 3 and again, she repeats words every other sentence, but I downloaded the triology to my kindle and will force myself to finish it.

Many have complained that the album's songs all exist in the same, mono-toned sound. Though there are a couple of songs that might seem to fall a bit flat next to the more popular ones, the overall effect of the album is a dreamy magnificence parallel to none.<br /><br />My top 3 favorite songs have to be:<br />1) 2 - Chained<br />2) 3 - Fiction<br />3) 6 - Sunset<br /><br />These are some of the best standouts of the album in addition to their very popular single, Angels.<br />All in all, this is definitely a must-buy if you are a lover of unique, indie musical experiences. As a side note, the guitar and bass are UNREAL. :)
B0037UUZQY|2.0|I order this doll for my niece for her birthday and the review states that \\"Includes a 10\\" wear-and-share hair extension\\" but the hair extension is missing .I am so disappointed .<br />The doll is ok
B006LSZECO|4.0|Easy reading but you never know what is going to next. A real page turner.  Sometimes had difficulty with time sequence and had to turn back to chapter title.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable does speed up the charging of the Kindle Fire as opposed to the cables that are used with the regular Kindle.  IMO, it shoud have been included with the purchase of the device, along with a plug/charger.  Seems like everything is a la carte these days though.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I found this to be a rambling, disjointed, aggravating read.  I selected the book after reading reviews and expected a great read.  I plowed through about half the book before I decided I had better things to do with my time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome! This series help my husband and I, if you know what I mean. I also love how easy it is to purchase e-books from Amazon.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Bullitt was Steve McQueen's own personal favorite of all the movies he made, and for good reason. This movie really captures the person that McQueen was in real life. For those of you who have never seen the film, the car chases sequence through downtown San Francisco is the one that all subsequent car chase scenes are measured against.  Again, this is pure Steve McQueen at work, and he does most of the driving himself. For muscle car lovers of the 1960's, you'll love the battle between McQueen's Mustang and the bad guys' 1968 Dodge Charger R/T. Wow! What a match up. My favorite line in the movie is when Jacqueline Bisset asks McQueen: \\"What will happen to us in time\\".  His answer, characteristically, was \\"Time starts now\\". This is a must-see McQueen film and one of my all time favorites. The views of San Francisco are breathtaking and all the cars from the 1960's just parked along the streets make for plenty of eye candy for auto enthusiasts.  An entertaining thriller with a surprise ending, lots of action, a love story and cars, cars, cars. What more could you want?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I was looking for a new game as I was bored with others my son told me about it. I love it. it is very addictive and fun. I would say for sure get this app.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved it!  Different from the mystery/suspense novels I usually read, but kept my attention and I never seemed to want to put it down. That resulted in a lot less sleep for the week and a half it took me to get through the trilogy, but well worth it!  Can't wait to rent the movie ;)
B000V9FZWS|5.0|Argerich and Prokofiev are a stellar combination.  Argerich is one of the absolute best pianists in the history of music.  Her tactile and technical perfection are clearly evident especially with her interpretations of contemporary composers, especially Prokofiev.  Her technique is perfect.  Her emotions are particularly clear in all of her artistry on the piano.  Would that I had even 5% of her talent.  Prokofiev's 3rd PC is probably one of the most demanding pieces of music ever written.  Argerich is infallible in her performance.  This recording is definitely Real...not Memorex.  Worth 10-times the price!
B00514HDNW|4.0|I did not realize that this book was written so long ago. There have been two movies created from it 'The Omega Man' staring Charlton Heston, released in 1971 and 'I am Legend' staring Will Smith released in 2007. There is talk that Warner Bros. are going to make 'I am Legend 2' soon.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this original story, even though neither of the movies followed the story line. I would recommend to my friends!
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Very disapointing, whoever wrote this book of nonsense needs more than a few history lessons.  The romance angles were trite and boring.  Really tired of the crap of right wing bad, left wing good.  Enjoyed the first book, regret purchasing the second and will ignore the third.  This is a fluff book.
B0015DROBO|1.0|My only reason for NOT buying the eBook was because of the free sample that I downloaded to my Kindle.  I was totally bored as it only talked about an accountant doing some boring accounting work.  After my friends told me how good it was I went back to the sample thinking I had read the wrong thing, but that wasn't the case.  I just watched the movie and if the sample had been even half as exciting as the movie I would have bought it.  Kindle should give an accurate sample to entice readers, not put them off, if they want us to buy more eBooks.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed does a beautiful job of capturing her loves and losses in this captivating, quick read. Her depth of honesty is inspiring and humbling and brings you into her world, both on and off the trail, immediately.
B00004RCKT|4.0|Movie was excellent. Problem is that after first viewing data stated that the player had to be set to Región 1 and this could only be done 2-3 times. After that it can no longer be viewed. I have NEVER had a dvd with this type of limitation. That means that i cannot see the movie after the third viewing. That is unacceptable because i bought the movie to see when i want to as many times as i want to. I am returning it as of 10/19/2012. A sad day for dvd purchases
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|it an antiquity based game of match three. The levels are challenging and entertaining. worth the purchase. There is a high level of replayability as the levels get harder as you beat the game and start anew.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A great example of unconditional love!  The story follows Eva and Gideon where \\"Bared to You\\" left off. I really appreciated the acts of love making and sex without the inflicting of pain or bondage.  Eva's past experiences were reflected nicely but still waiting for a little more on what happened in Gideon's past. Of course, waiting for the final book in the sequel.
1609611543|3.0|It has a lot of statistics so I found it hard to keep reading.  I was able to get the information out that I wanted it just took a lot longer than anticipated.  Not an easy flow read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great puzzle game!  It is fun and addictive.  I love that as the levels become more difficult it is still possible to solve.
0525952926|2.0|Winter of the World is a disappointment. Although Follett knows how to piece together a sweeping story, his wordsmithing skills are mediocre. This deprives the reader of the rich mental imagery that a good writer can elicit. He relies heavy on unlikely coincidences on every few pages to have characters running into each other over vast temporal and geographic distances in a way that constantly reminds the reader that he is an observer of a constructed story rather than a participant in the characters' lives.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved being in the mind of the said narrator \\"Charlie\\" .  it does an amazing job of showing growth , young love, friendship, and anything else that could be going through a young boys mind - in an unconventional way. Perspective being a common theme throughout,  Charlie certainly gives you many things to reflect on. id recommend it to anyone who likes a light read, but don't get me wrong its still quite engaging. I refused to put it down and before i knew it, it was over.I wish i was the person he was writing to and for him to have continued his sophomore year (maybe as a sequel). Then again its great in a way that he didn't, because that means hes well on his way to a full recovery.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|well done game, but can only play a few minutes until you run out of coins.  then you put it away and play another day, as you gain more coins over time.  it is pointless fun.
0525423281|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! The characters were so real and so well written. I loved Lola and her charm. She felt so real for a 17 year old character trying to figure out love and life, even when I wanted to kick her in the butt to move her along faster! I have to say that her parents were one of my favorite things about this book. Nathan and Andy are amazing parents that had me in stitches at times with their protective nature. They reminded me so much of a few parents of my high school friends. This book would not have been the same without them. The little snippets with Anna and St. Clair left me smiling and wanting to relive their path to romance once again. And of course there is Cricket. He is such a sweet, adorable and truly REAL boy. He IS the boy next door. And he left me swooning.<br /><br />Definitely a must read and one I will enjoy rereading over and over again!<br /><br />~Sara @ Forever 17 Books

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I usually do not like match games. this one makes you match tiles to try to get objects to fall off the board. it amused me almost all day yesterday and is just as much fun today.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|It is an entertaining book, with detailed historical accounts on the first world war and the social and political state of Great Britain, Germany, USA and Rusia. But its characters are involved in some non credible situations; in short, an exagerated novel, not unlike one of those TV series like 24, Breaking bad, etc. in an historical context.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I think that this book was tremendous and i cant wait to read the new series. I am really going to miss Percy, Annabeth , Grover, and all the other characters.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This c-o-u-l-d have been one of the better books I've ever read! The plot was well thought out. The build-up was great .. you couldn't wait to find out what happened. It  kept you guessing along the way. Then as it started toward the resolution to the story, the plot started falling apart .. like the author lost their train of thought. Well, it went downhill from there .. and had a MOST disappointing ending. And I'm thinking: \\"You're kidding, right? I read this whole book for THIS!!\\" I give the book 2 stars only because 4/5 of the book was great. But the ending made you wonder what the build-up was all about. If the author went back and re-did the ending, it could be an amazing book!
006197806X|5.0|I was so in love with the first book, Delirium! Alex melted my heart with his love and his beautiful words and I was so rooting for them to escape and find a way to be in love, away from the world that believed it to be a disease. Then it ended with an EPIC cliffhanger! Seriously, I was like \\"WHAT?! NOOOOO, don't leave it there!!\\" Needless to say, I could not wait to get my hands on this next book, Pandemonium!<br /><br />At the end of Delirium, Lena finds herself alone in the Wilds after running for her life and losing Alex, who she believes is dead. In this book, the chapters alternate between the 'now', which is where Lena finds herself after a certain amount of time has passed, and 'then' which takes place right where Delirium ends, with Lena entering the Wilds and fighting to survive. I have to say when I first saw this setup I was a little worried it might be confusing, but I didn't feel that way at all while I was reading! It worked really well with the plot and left me on the edge of my seat with each chapter ending, not wanting to put the book down until I found out what was happening in the other time frame. And how Lena has transformed through this book! She becomes this strong girl, so much more so than in Delirium, who is determined to fight to survive for what she believes is right. There was lots of action this time around that kept me hooked and not wanting to put it down! We are introduced to amazing new characters, like Raven and Julian, but I did feel myself missing a couple of the old ones I loved from Delirium. I am hoping they make an appearance in the final book of the trilogy.<br /><br />I really don't want to say much else on the plot because this is a book you do NOT want anything spoiled before reading. Trust me. But I will say the ending was just as epic a cliffhanger as the first! Once again I found myself saying, 'WHAT?! NOOOOO, don't leave it there!!\\" And now I want to cry, thinking of the long wait to 2013 and Requiem.<br /><br />Truly an amazing read and I recommend anyone who hasn't read either book in the series to hurry and pick up a copy of both ASAP!<br /><br />~Sara @ Forever 17 Books
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I finished this book at about 3am. After closing my kindle I lay in bed and asked myself did I like it? And the answer was... I had no idea. The next day at work all I could think about was the answer to the question, I couldn't get the story out of my head. Travis was an obsessed character to a somewhat frightening degree.. But I loved him. For the most part the story had a very \\"real\\" feeling that I think I was confronted about, it wasn't like there was a villain to despise or a mystery to discover.. It was just a story about two intense people trying to make it work, struggling through the thoughts that maybe love isn't enough. So when I finished it, I just felt really weird, maybe a little uneasy, I still can't really explain it but the feeling made me realise that I actually really enjoyed the book. Its a worthwhile read, if you are looking for a story that will stick with you for a while, look no further.
B008VKNEJU|4.0|Great new artist, with wide-ranging sensibilities. I hear a little 80's in the instrumentation. A little 90's in the singing style. Contemporary and timeless in the lyrics. Great new talent.
0312430000|5.0|Dr. Gawande's Checklist Manifesto should be required reading in every medical school. Brilliant, simple prescription for enhancing healthcare and reducing medical errors by following a checklist, as a pilot does prior to, during, landing flights. Also enjoyed \\"A Surgeon's Notes\\" - shows how doing simple things, like washing hands, can create a safer healthcare environment. Dr. Gawande is one of the great physicians/patient advocates/healthcare transformers/change agents of our time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've tried a few free apps that do white noise/relaxation sounds and they were mediocre at best.  Downloaded the free version of this app and was so impressed I purchased the full version!  Easy to use, can save favorites, the sounds are realistic and you don't hear skips or pauses as the sounds loop.  Tons of variety, though I find myself using the same sounds over and over.  I use this for sleep... best sleep I've had in a long time!
0802473156|4.0|My wife and I were given this book by a mutual friend and we decided to read it out loud together each night before bed. We found that there was a TON of well-documented research in this book that can be very helpful. However, we did not finish it to the end and have since forgotten most of what we learned. For my taste it was a little TOO detailed to be easliy followed.  However, I feel like I still have much to learn from this book and will pick it up again soon to see if I can do better this time around.  :)  If you are like me and need something simple to try out, I would suggest [[ASIN:0985923202 something like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality]]. It's not a \\"relationship\\" book per se, but anything that helps you to become \\"aware\\" will help you in ALL aspects of your life.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|After reading a stream of paranormal reads, a strong contemporary was something I was craving and exactly what I found with Slammed.<br /><br />The story starts out strong, a young girl, Layken, moves into a new house out of state and is attracted to her new neighbor, Will. They go on a sweet first date, listening to poetry, which is an important part of Will's life. But then a twist happens. I honestly didn't expect it. The characters are thrown into obstacle after obstacle, keeping them apart. I love this type angst and tension between characters. To see them really fight themselves and their circumstances to find a way to be together is something that keeps me engrossed in a story and turning pages. I was hooked and had a hard time putting the book down because I wanted to know how they would overcome all that life was throwing at them. My only gripe about it was I wish more of their relationship developed before the twist because it did seem to be a little instalove-ish. But overall, it worked. It was almost like the forces keeping these two characters apart is what was making them fall more and more in love, and I can get behind that in story-telling.<br /><br />But this isn't just a story about romance. Family is integral to the novel. Both Layken and Will have a devastating past but their bravery and fight was endearing to read about. Sometimes it felt like, woah, there is A LOT going on with these characters, but I think it also makes it special and an enjoyment to read.<br /><br />Slammed had so much depth and carried so much emotion throughout. I often found myself laughing out loud, but then having to set the book aside to take breathes amidst my tears. I fell in love with all of the characters, main and secondary. The book would not have been the same without them. My absolute favorite moments were the poetry slams. The words were so beautiful and touching. Every single one. I commend the author for her talent. Slams are meant to be personal and I felt the anger, hurt, happiness and pain in each one a character shares. What else hit me was the attention to little details and how integrated and detrimental to the story they were, like the little purple hair clip. Little things like that are so magical to an emotional read like this one.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this novel to those who love a good laugh and cry. If you were a fan of Pushing the Limits, than this book may be for you! There is a sequel novel called Point of Retreat that is also available now!<br /><br />~Sara @ Forever 17 Books
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|I thought this movie was solid. From the cinematography, art direction, writing,story, acting, directing, production, evan costume - all I thought hit their mark. Good work all around. This movie is a good example of when you have a good story and it is well written it can lift everything else. I imagine that during the production of this movie the people involved knew they had something. The acting was strong for all of the major characters. Props to the casting director who, it seemed, made some interesting choices that paid off big. I am happy that a blockbuster action hero type was not cast as the gladiator and they went with Russel Crowe. Crowe really does have some acting chops. Who would thought that a shy, introverted, tabacco executive (The Insider) could knock it out of the park as a Roman General. \\"Quintus why are you armed?\\" was a memorable scene along with others. Jaquin Phoenix really stood out too as the ambitious, manipulative, bastard son too Marcus Aurelius. Connie Neilson, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi et all ..  grade A

0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy and JK Rowling are pure genius. Rowling takes you to picturesque Pagford, a small English town, and introduces you to a cast of characters that will make you laugh, cry and pound your fists in anger.  I was engrossed in every word and when I wasn't reading, I was thinking of the characters and longing to get back to Pagford and to the lives of those who live there.  I had no trouble keeping up with who was who, and enjoyed how their lives intertwined with one another.  This book makes you think about class distinctions, prejudices and social issues.  It brings to light the petty thoughts and personality flaws that many of us have.  The characters in the book are people we all know. And to get into their thoughts... well, it was down right hilarious at times.<br /><br />I have found myself feeling duped when I have chosen a book for the high ratings on Amazon only to be sorely disappointed. Likewise, I feel a little angry when I read the bad reviews written about this book because:<br />a. 'of the bad language'-- If the characters didn't use bad language, it wouldn't have been authentic.<br />b. 'It's not like Harry Potter at all'-- No it's not. It's not intended to be. Rowling and her publisher made it very clear that this was not written for children.  Rowling is a writer. Writers have many stories to tell.  She has every right to use her talents to write any genre that she chooses.<br />c. 'I couldn't finish it' -- then don't review the book!!!!<br />d. 'It was priced too high'--  Seriously???<br /><br />I am happy that I ignored the bad reviews of this masterpiece and read it anyway. Do yourself a favor, do not read the bad reviews and see for yourself what a great book this is.
0486278077|5.0|You cannot beat an old classic. I always loved this story. I'm keen on wordy books. I love to be overwhelmed by description and beautiful lavish language. Though the writing style is often flowery the novel is something I truly adore. Oscar Wilde transcends time. He is still an inspiration even now. And Dorian Gray is truly a remarkable multi layered story. Buy it! You will not regret the purchase.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not only has this trilogy been exciting and interesting, it has been written so well that the underlying story exudes from the erotica.  Enjoyed it!
B008K5T5AI|3.0|The entire book is actually nothing but a chase after a single piece of information. We got some nice action, some lovely scenery, the usual assortment of Eccentric and outright weird Minds, Drones and humans and even some background on how the Culture came to be, but one kept wondering what the point was. The comparison to Excession is actually too kind: here the personalities of the Minds don't even get to shine through - in Excession, the, um, Excession was a big effing deal. Here, the chase after the Zidhren is kind of pointless and even the Minds involved in it admit that whatever the find is probably not going to influence the Gzilt Sublimation. As for the human characters, the oldest dude in the Culture is mildly interesting, but not enough. The main protagonist is an example of a favorite trope of a outsider thrown into the middle of a wide-reaching conspiracy and she acts her part well (the repeated gag with her cumbersome instrument is hilarious), but the problem is that even when her life is threatened, we don't really care, because the whole plotline is, as noted above, pointless. Same is true of the main antagonist, if he can indeed be called that - the big event is already set in motion and one just doesn't feel any threat or urgency. This is only underscored by the big revelation which is spoiled very early and when it finally comes, it doesn't come of as a big deal at all. With the religious aspect, one is reminded of one of the many Da Vinci Code knock-offs (like Khoury's 'The Last Templar') where the 'truth' to be revealed simply wouldn't have any effect on anything in any version of reality.<br />All in all, another opportunity wasted.
1439152799|4.0|Fans of Kate Morton will surely love this book. As with her previous novels, she has woven a truly compelling tale overflowing with mysterious themes which capture the reader's interest. Reality and unreality conjoin like twin shadows, often forcing the reader to question what is feigned and what is bona fide, what is the result of madness and what is rational, who is sane and who is not. It was sometimes hard to separate fact from fancy.<br />This is the story of a family scarred by the horrors of war, unrequited love, heartbreak, scandals, secrets and madness. Ruled by a patriarch determined to protect his ancestral castle, he exerts enormous control over his descendants, even from beyond the grave.<br />The Blythe offspring have been cloistered for most of their lives within the confines of the castle. Twins, Persephone and Seraphina, and a younger sibling, Juniper, progeny of two different mothers, inhabit a world often created by their own imagination, hence sometimes intersecting with the real world in disharmony.  Their lives and loves are hidden within the confines of the castle's stone walls.<br />Meredith Baker is a victim of wartime displacement. At age 14, she is moved with many children, to the countryside, where they will live with host families because their parents fear it is too dangerous for them to remain in London. Separated from her siblings, she is sent to live in a castle, with the Blythe children and their father, Raymond, a famous author. At Milderhurst Castle she discovers her true desires and blossoms.<br />The story begins years later. Meredith is married and in her 65th year. Stoic and secretive, she has never revealed her castle experience to her daughter, and when a letter from the past, from that time of her life, unexpectedly arrives so many years later, she opens up a sliver of light into her hidden background because of the profound reaction the letter causes to her state of mind.<br />The past and present merge as the story unfolds and is developed by Meredith's daughter, Edith, who discovers the actual Milderhurst castle when she gets lost returning from a business trip. The sisters still live there in its state of decay and through her exploration and research, the walls of the castle reveal their mysteries, exposing the tragedies residing there and illuminating the history of the family that lived there.<br />The characters are wonderfully drawn and images of them are sharp and clear. It is easy to identify with the emotions they experience. Although the first half of this rather lengthy 650+ page book doesn't move that quickly, the second half takes off, and the pages fly. It was hard to put it down as I was completely engaged in the effort to discover how the story would resolve and I was not disappointed. My interest was captured and fulfilled as the secrets were revealed.<br /><br />***Based on Advanced Readers Copy

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the language toward the end. How can I recommend this to my younger sister (whom I love to share books with) if there are a bunch of F-bombs peppered through the last book? Otherwise, amazing!

B008V0OLOW|1.0|all of her albums have a sexy picture of her and that is the best part-if she didn't take such a good picture one would wonder if she could even get a recording contract. This is very average and boring pop music packed and sold much like most consumer products-all packaging with little content.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I just started playing this game. I have played lots of match 3 type games. this one is different in that you need to figure out how to &quot;free&quot; certain objects so you need to make matches that will make the objects fall. So this games takes a little more thought and strategy than other match-3 games. So far I like it!
B009AMALLM|3.0|I'm a fan of this series and I have to say I liked Paranormal Activity 4. It's not one of the strongest entries in the series but, I still had spooky fun with it and the last act delivered the goods. I think there still is enough of what fans like about this series to entertain but, next entry better start cranking things up and taking risks. This entry opens up in 2011. A family in Nevada gets new neighbors across the street. A strange boy named Robbie (Brady Allen) and his single mom, Katie (Katie Featherston). When his mom is suddenly taken to the hospital, the family takes creepy Robbie in. Once there, teen Alex (Kathryn Newton) starts to notice strange occurrences as Robbie befriends her little brother, Wyatt (Aiden Lovecamp) and so she and boyfriend, Ben (Matt Shively) set up cameras and set the household laptops to record to get to the bottom of things that are going bump in the night...and day, too. Soon Alex begins to believe Robbie is not the only new occupant in the house. The first act seems to be a bit choppy and there are a few odd edits throughout and it is in act 1 in which the film has it's strongest feeling of déjà vu but, things start to pick up steam during the middle act and the movie really starts to click and become more it's own thing. Then the third act locks in and delivers the goods up to and including the spine-chilling climax. Sure, along the way there are some familiar elements but, you wouldn't remove Jason's hockey mask would you? There were enough new wrinkles in my book to keep things going, as well as, some subtle hints as to where the mythos might be headed. Not to mention a surprising reveal, too. The cast are all fine. The parents get the least screen time and character development but, the teens are likable, Wyatt is sweet and Robbie is very creepy. Series regular Katie Featherston gets a bigger role then early screenings suggested and without spoiling things, I liked how the character was used and Katie Featherston did a good job with her role. All in all there is some definite 'been there done that' but, I think fans will enjoy this entry enough to want more and that's what the filmmakers will have to deliver next time to keep this series going. It's time to really take some chances and give us something to really bite our nails over. Paranormal Activity 4 is a nice snack to hold us over till then but, it's time for Katie and company to give us a full meal of fright and new surprises.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is the best book in the Heroes of Olympus series yet. The Romans and Greeks are finally coming together as a huge demigod team to defeat the rising earth mother Gaea... or so we thought. Due to some unforseen events, the seven demigods of the newest Great Prophecy are off to Rome with a band of Romans after them, lead by the unforgiving Octavian, the Roman augur. As they head off to the land of Rome (where no demigod in their right mind would dare to enter)the seven demigods complete some mini \\"quests\\" of their own in order to gain more knowledge of the prophecy. Told from the point of views of the four Greek demigods, the Mark of Athena is the best adventure yet.<br /><br />This story really ties together what The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune have been leading up to. Annabeth and Percy are finally reunited, Jason finally sees his camp again, and Hazel meets the strange boy Leo who looks (and acts) just like her lost love from another life (with Frank standing by her side the whole time). The character chemistry is flawless in this book. Percy and Jason (despite some rocky moments) are so far getting along well. Percy and Annabeth's relationship is as hilarious (and only a tad romantic)as usual. Piper and Jason are still a cute couple. And Leo, Hazel, and Frank still have that love trianlge (that's slowly being sorted out). The character chemistry and development earns an A+<br /><br />The \\"mini quests\\" the demigods go on in groups are... awesome. Rick Riordan doesn't fail to incorporate new myths and historical figures in the Mark of Athena. The story behind the actual \\"Mark of Athena\\" and the \\"Athena Parthenos\\" is flawlessly execuited, as well as Annabeth's solo quest (which had me on the edge of my seat the whole time). The meeting of more gods and the battle between the twin giants and Jason and Percy was extremely epic. Everything was just what Percy Jackson fans want... and even more.<br /><br />The book is darker and more sinister thanthe original Percy Jackson series and the Lost Hero and Son of Neptune. While Riordan doesn't deprive us of his witty humor, he appears to know that his audience of readers is \\"growing up.\\" Pleanty of us have been with Percy and his friends since we were kids; the darker plot, more sinister and cruel aspects of the book really set the tone for the rest of the series. While it still is a kids series, there are plenty of symbolism and points to the book that really are a teenage to an adult matter. Riordan really knows how to please all audiences.<br /><br />I loved how all the characters got to talk and go on those mini quests together. We got (some) Romans and Greeks getting along! I mean, who can overlook the instant friendship between Annabeth and Frank? And Annabeth and Reyna... I like those two together. A lot. They're going to be best friends in the future (after the demigods stop Octavian and the rest of the Roman camp from attacking Camp Half-Blood.) Anyway, character chemistry and relationships were flawless.<br /><br />Characters, humor, suspense, mystery... all those aspects really set forth the book. I couldn't put it down. It was that great!<br /><br />Oh, and did anyone else get the Mythbusters reference in the book? I think Leo was talking about Archimides's death ray and Frank said that he saw a television show where people proved it wrong. (Leo said that it was  because the mortals didn't use Celestial Bronze.) Hey guys? Yeah. That was an actual episode in  Mythbusters. Look it up.<br /><br />Two words: THE ENDING.<br /><br />While the ending was heartbreaking, spirit-crushing, total fangirl moment of the book... it was actually a great part of the book. Probably one of my favorite. SPOILER: When Percy and Annabeth fell, did you guys notice how that was kind of their way of saying that they are done? Like, they're tired of being pawns in the gods' world? Yeah, it was there guys. Look it up.<br /><br />I could go on forever, but sadly I can't.<br /><br />Read the book. I highly recommend it.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|I understand charging for the game. However, why do we have to pay for additional power ups? Instead of charging for power ups, just let an elasped amount of time pass before allowing them to refill. Ape do not cost that much money to procure. That's why we have so many of them today. Anyone with half a knats brain can create an app. Most everyone 50 years or younger have a pretty good grip on technology. Therefore, charging for power ups is highway robbery. Descent game all the same.
1455519006|5.0|I always look forward to a Baldacci novel and The Innocent was no exception.  Always moving and a fun thriller.  Good character in Robie and the pairing with Julie reminded me of the relationship in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Well, I'm about 100 pages in and find it kind of hard to get going. But will keep at it
B001NLKS16|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I couldn't believe it when I saw it.  I had no idea there was a book to go along with the show.  I have watched every single episode of Supernatural and the book is such a great idea!  It really appears as though you are reading John Winchester's Journal.  Very neat - if you are a freakish fan like me, then you have to have this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|have'nt spent a dime and still have loads of fun.its all in picking the right prize.I love it and play non-stop
0316228532|1.0|Doesn't matter who wrote it. It's not a good book. The plot and storyline are my cup of tea, so Iif anything I was biased toward liking it but by page 20 I was sad and disappointed that The Casual Vacancy was not to be the cozy \\"someone died in a small English town lets have a look at everyone's lives\\" story I'd anticipated. Not sure who would enjoy this book. Someone already miserable and cynical and dull, who's also not looking for an escape from all that.
B008COD5OO|1.0|HORRIBLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. IF YOU WATCH THIS YOUR BRAIN WILL ROT. IF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS REALLY ACT LIKE THIS...SMH... EVERY 30 SECONDS THE MOVIE FLASHES TO A SLOWED DOWN MOVEMENT DANCING SCENE AND IT SUCKED.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome....this book had me from beginning to end. Eva and Gideon has grown in so many ways. You can't help but love these characters. Must read.I can't wait for the third book.
B000002LEE|5.0|This band was imperative to the alternative movement back in the 90's.  The kicker - they were doing this stuff in the 80's!  They are the real deal, they did their own thing when no one else was doing it.  Their music has a catchy infectious beat, and Perry's voice is like no other.<br /><br />Whenever I need a pick me up (be it while cleaning the house, driving, etc), throwing this on is a sure winner - instant mood lifter! :)<br /><br />PS - If you by chance happen on a concert - GO!!!  Best live band ever!
B008YRVW0I|2.0|free to try a few levels then you have to buy. lousy way to advertise your product :( This is a fun jewels type game where you can win money to build a fish tank. I love these type of games and really liked their Atlantis game. won't be purchasing because of the trick they pulled though!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was the best gift I've ever purchased for myself! I never watched the West Wing when it was airing, but my daughter forced me to watch one episode a couple of years ago and wow! It wasn't long before I had viewed them all. But this collection is so much more than just the entire series set ..... Behind the scene commentaries give me info than my daughters/sons didn't know (who knew a fish bowl could say so much!). Worth every penny!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The story line is good, the character development was excellent, and the special effects outstanding.  An enjoyable experience and time well spent!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Seems like I'm going in circles... Is there an end? Either way, I like it. Keeps me awake at work.
B007X98S82|5.0|This second volume completes Isabelle Faust's recording of the Bach Sonatas and Partitas.  It has been eagerly awaited by many people and they won't be disappointed - Faust's remarkable skill and musicianship produce a terrific interpretation.  She plays with minimal vibrato, exceptionally intelligent ornamentation and a directness which is very striking.  The closing Presto of the First Sonata, for example, is quite brilliant here, taken at a thrilling speed with Faust's magnificent technique allowing her to remain utterly fluent and completely engaged, and other movements show similarly exceptional skill and imagination.<br /><br />Whether this is the recording for you will depend upon your response to Faust's interpretation, which may not suit everyone.  All three of the sonatas and partitas on this disc are minor-key works and they are very meditative and atmospheric.  As an example, in the hands of Rachel Podger the opening movement of the disc, the Adagio of Sonata No.1, is mournful but humane and Viktoria Mullova's reading is more sinewy but shot through with human melancholy.  For Isabelle Faust it seems rather bleak and desolate - marvellously played and interpreted but, for me anyway, not an easy listen.<br /><br />The recording is slightly dry which adds to the slight sense of mortality and darkness which seems to me to pervade much of this disc.  Personally, I think that's great and the effect is powerful and moving.  I am very glad to have Isabelle Faust's Bach alongside my other loved interpretations and I think this will be a recording which I will still be playing in many years' time.  Very warmly recommended.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like being able to clearly see the charge on my new battery - no ambiguity. When my DROID2 says it's fully charged, a check of this app has shown that it's over 90%, but not yet 100%. I wonder how often our battery life is shortened because we don't know that....
B001E45XT4|2.0|These would be a great headset if they weren't so tight.  They look huge, but if you have a larger head, like I do, stay away or go with Plantronics new line, which are much more comfortable.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|This is my wife's and my favorite tv show.  Funny, smart, and a continuous story.  We watched the whole season in a week.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Outstanding, both in research and in story and characters. This was a very fast and entertaining read and I enjoyed it as much as the previous novel in this trilogy.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I just got my movie today from Disney! I pre-ordered it long ago because I knew I would just love it! And love it I did! I was so excited that they added this winter story because that is my favorite time of year! I highly recommend this movie! It is so good and meeting Periwinkle, Tink's sister was awesome! Buy it! You won't regret it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Purchased the 2nd season after it was not offered on Netflix. I love this show--my favorite to come out in a very, very long time. Can't wait for season 3. Love buying movies and shows thru Amazon direct because the quality is fantastic and they are on my TV waiting for me without me having to find disc's or trying to remember which episode I'm on. The shows are always available and ready when I am. I can't ask for anything more!
B008Y1YFNU|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this CD. It is ok, but nothing special. Quite commercial and not very heavy. Need to get some fire back in my opinion and not cater for teeny boppers!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|I really liked the alternate ending that this DVD offered, EXCEPT it took me forever to figure out how to get to it.  I have always liked the movie - lots of action and Angelina J. is fantastic.  But, I like the alternate ending better than the original.
0545157617|5.0|I bought this book for my kids when they were 3 and 1(now 6 and 3).  They fell in love with this book immediately--as did I.  We love Stick Man and his family--cute illustrations of their tree house and of his adventures.  I would love to see her write a sequel to this book.  It is very cute.<br />Also, the Snail and the Whale, Room on the Broom, and the Gruffalo are some of my kids favorites!!!! We also go Where is My Momma, the Giant book and the Gruffalo's child--not surhe what happened with these but my kids had no interest in them AT ALL!<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with Stick Man!  I buy this book now for all my friends who have new babies.  :)<br /><br />PS  The Gruffalo movie is a big hit with my kids too.
B009GENZKS|5.0|Good film using the cold war references I heard about. Fairly straight forward story line with the expected loose ends,
0143121006|5.0|Well written and interesting from both the mystery and historical aspects.<br />Fast flowing and hard to put down - read in one sitting during international flight!<br />Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ive had the computer version for awhile now but ive wanted the kindle fire version ti come out forever.  Now it has!  Yes I know its prideful buts its worth it!  Notch and other minecraft programmers are constantly working on updates!  So the pocket addition will be constintly updating.  I heard that there will soon be actually servers for the pocket addition!  over all this app is awesome!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|I was looking for something fun, fast moving and action.  The Avengers met this criteria.  It's a movie that I will watch again and again - particularly a raining Saturday afternoon.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|Great movie! Our entire family enjoys watching this. Our little ones laugh and we get a good chuckle from it too.
B008RTE09S|4.0|and even Paul McCartney admits on the commentary track it suffered from indulgence. At the time of its first (limited) run in theaters, I recall most of my friends agreed... that we could no longer consider our beloved Beatles perfect, and certainly not as film makers. However, the concept was a good one and had it been left to seasoned film makers, perhaps it wouldn't have seemed so hodge-podge and, having benefitted from a script, would have been more coherent. The structure of Michael Nesmith's Elephant Parts is really quite similar, but without the bus.  (3 stars on the film)<br /><br />As far as the new blu-ray is concerned, a satisfying print was somehow gleaned from the substandard 16mm celluloid and the music compositions have been given a remarkable surround treatment, one of which I'm happy to say has finally been remixed in stereo from beginning to end (I Am The Walrus). It's worth the price if only just for the music videos (Fool On The Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, I Am The Walrus, and Your Mother Should Know),  which can be directly accessed on the search menu. One personal mystery was solved; I always thought the aerial footage utilized on \\"Flying\\" was derived from Stanley Kubrick's  Dr. Strangelove. Paul commented that's precisely where he got it (with permission, of course). (5 stars on the blu-ray)
0316228532|4.0|I for one enjoyed this book.  I thought it depicted the common sins of our humanity.  Rowling  shows what jealousy, greed, and loveless families without true guidance springs forth in this world.  It shows how our lives seriously effect our children  in the most important years of their  lives.  Although the language is a bit raw, you skim over these words in the anticipation of reading onward.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Took most of the book to read nothing - took forever to get to the point.  When it got to the point, it was pointless...
0385344333|5.0|What can I say? I love Lee Child's novels about Jack Reacher. I wanted to be first in purchasing \\"A wanted man\\". I just started to read (or better devour) it!!!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Several of my author friends recommended this book to me in the past year and I finally broke down and bought it to read on a recent trip across the country.  I rarely pay over a few bucks for a book but gave in because I want to improve my writing and besides, it's a tax write-off!<br /><br />So I'm sitting in my airline seat with the intention of skipping Steve's personal life story and diving straight into the Tools For Writing but as I started reading, I found myself engrossed in Steve's personal life. I kept giggling and laughing out loud from stories of Steve's childhood including the babysitter and the poison ivy incident.  My husband kept asking me, \\"What's so funny?\\" Before long my husband's eyes drifted to my Kindle and he was laughing and quoting lines before I even got to the part.  So we're both reading and laughing a mile high.  When we got to the Tools For Writing, my husband said he wasn't interested in that part or (so he thought) because his eyes were back on my Kindle and he was quoting lines again like \\"A plumber from outer space?\\"  Although my husband is not a writer, he wants to read this book from the beginning.<br /><br />The Tools- Now this was the part I was looking forward to reading and was not disappointed. I love Stephen's advice on symbols and I am going to re-write to include this in my second novel.<br /><br />The bad words.  Stephen explains that using bad words is a part of life and making it real.  This is a real touchy subject in the Christian genre and there are many discussions on Amazon regarding whether to use or not to use foul language.  I chose not to in my first book and will not use bad language in the second.  I will use replacement words. If anyone has watched Gold Rush Alaska on the Discovery Channel, it's a reality show about six men who risk everything to strike it rich mining for gold in the wilds of Alaska, anyways, Todd is a Christian and he uses \\"replacement\\" words such as \\"freaking\\" or \\"What the Frick.\\"  I think that works.  A reviewer for a book [[ASIN:B004GKMQEI Pray (The Revelation Chronicles)]] summed it up best; in her 1-star review Bev says, \\"I was so disappointed. There is no reason for the author to mix a message of salvation with profanity.\\"<br /><br />So I think Stephen King can get away with using bad words in his novels but I will not take his advice on this one.<br /><br />\\"I really enjoyed this book and I loved when Steve told about how he came up with the idea's to write his stories like Carrie, Cujo and The Shining.\\"  Back in the 80's I worked in a video store and we had all Steve King's novels that were made into movies so I was familiar with quite a few.  The Stand is my all time favorite.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, this book was worth every penny.<br /><br />I recommend this book for all writers and Stephen King fans.<br /><br />Patience Prence<br />Bestselling author of SCARS: An End-Times Novelk that works.

B005LAIHR2|1.0|The movie itself is quite good. The digital copy, on the other hand, kills it. Mobile devices should stop carrying the Flixster app because it takes freedom away from the consumer. Not only that, it's redundant. iOS devices have iCloud, Windows Phone has SkyDrive and Android has Google Play. With UltraViolet, the digital copy has to be watched through the Flixster app which has a horrible user interface.
B00846REIS|2.0|I bought this book for my Kindle based on other reviewers' opinions and it was just so awful!  There was no development of the characters, the dialogue between Eva and Gideon didn't flow and in many instances was just plain stupid... real people don't talk like that!  I loved the Fifty Shades series and this was just a cheesy attempt to copy that story!  No woman wants to read naughty sex scenes that use the word \\"c u next tuesday\\" on a regular basis... there is nothing sexy about that, just vulgar!<br /><br />Anyway, if you are thinking about purchasing this.... don't.... seriously!
B007THA4FI|2.0|The characters are diverse but shallow. They are, for the most part , pretty unsympathetic. Perhaps I just expected too much.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book! it had everything i wanted and hope it would be. love the percy and annabeth moments! love the action parts even if it was a bit dry in that department. great book overall. recommend to teens and some adults.
B0000AC8LR|5.0|A film we'll be trying to figure out for years to come.  A cult classic that was never going to find a mass audience.  Even if the filmmaker has taken some missteps since, this is a near perfect film.  Love the 80s setting and soundtrack, love the wacky rabbit and time travel, love the high school parts (more honest than moist HS films), love the actors and their characters.  What's happened to Jena Malone and where was she when I was in HS?  Anyway, highly recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this series so much. It grabbed me and I just never wanted to put it down until it was over.
B00992CF6W|3.0|dynamite dont work which needs to be fixed NOW like really whats the point of having dynamite when it doesnt even work!!! :/
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I think Maru Surrat's actual innocence was irrelevant to me by the end of this film. What was relevant is why the attourney fought so hard for her. As humans, we have the ultimate control over our own emotions and  prejudices. We can choose to react or to think. This film gives deep respect to the founders of the Constitution as well as shows the need we have for it. Excellent film.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SO I SUGGEST YOU BUY IT IF YOU ARE UNSURE. No other words are really necessary.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|2010's \\"The Expendables\\" was directed by star Sylvester Stallone. It was a fun movie. For \\"Expendables 2\\", Stallone moves over(he's the star), and the director is action-veteran Simon West. More fun. \\"Expendables 2\\" did only $84 million in the U.S., but overseas ticket sales broke $300 million. Can you say No. 3? \\"Expendables 2\\" offers our noble, grizzled action stars re-united by Mr. Church(Bruce Willis) for what looks like an easy plunder-paycheck(They think). A new rookie member is gunned down right in front of the group, and an angry quest for revenge leads to a series of bloody confrontations. Tough-guy Chuck Norris shows up in the middle of the movie for a violent battle, filmed on what looks like the Warners' back lot. Chuck Norris promptly kicks everybody's butt. \\"Grandfather\\" action stars also include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren. In one scene, Schwarzenegger demands a rocket-gun being held by the big black man. The big dude says: \\"You better not mess with my gun, or you'll be terminated\\". Not missing a beat, Arnold says: \\"You should be so lucky...\\"West shoots on location in China, Hong Kong, Louisiana, and The Devetaki Cave, in Bulgaria. A light-hearted adventure, \\"Expendables 2\\" is lots of inside jokes and huff-and-puff humor. DVD extras include Blue-Ray 1080p hi-def, and DTS-HD Master Audio. The DVD is a beautiful anamorphic transfer with 5.1 Dolby Digital audio. You also get commentary with director Simon West, \\"Gods of War; Earth's Anti-Action Heroes\\" featurette, \\"Big Guns, Rise of the Action Film\\" featurette, \\"Assault: Real-Life Weaponry of The Expendables\\" featurette, \\"Guns for Hire\\" featurette, Deleted Scenes, and a Gag Reel. Our ageing band of \\"tough guys\\" all fare well. All except, perhaps, Governor Schwarzenegger. In so many scenes, his hair is fluffed-up and messy! He looks like he just got out of bed with the maid. Bang. Bang.
B0012GVKVY|4.0|If you are detective Spooner, your beat is Chicago's Precinct 28, not a bad neighborhood, if it wasn't for the abominable robots - they're everywhere; the very sight of one fills you with revulsion and guilt.  Everyday you are haunted by flashbacks of that terrible auto accident - you survived, but the little girl ... well ... that robot, that glorified can opener, should have save her...  You hate them!<br /><br />If you are Lt. Bergin, you have taken Spooner under your wing, he is a good detective, but his obsessive suspicion of robots interferes with his judgement.  When Spooner is called to investigate the apparent suicide of Dr. Lanning in the atrium lobby of the U.S. Robotics tower, you fervently hope he doesn't foolishly blame a robot for Lanning's death.<br /><br />If you are Dr. Susan Calvin, you worked closely with Dr. Lanning, shared his dream, and you thought you knew him ... his suicide came as a surprise.  When you escorted Spooner to Lanning's lab, you were annoyed by his rude comments about robots, stunned when a robot picked up a gun, and horrified when Spooner shot the robot as it escaped.<br /><br />If you are Sonny, you are in a state of confused emotions.  Fear, guilt, and anger wash over you as the detective grills you; especially anger ... over ... his insistence that you murdered your father!  Impossible!  You are a robot. . . .<br /><br />Comment:  The film portrays a believable near-future when humanoid robots are common; what is not believable is the way the robots are retired.  Understand, the older robots are quiet humanlike, well mannered, likable, you might even say lovable, and yet, when they are trucked to the landfill, no one speaks up for them.<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray 2008): 5.  Languages: English, French, Spanish.  Subtitles: English, (no French), Spanish, Korean, Cantonese.<br /><br />( Rewritten 15 November 2012)
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|I'll keep this one brief, to me Godspeed You! Black Emperor are the daddies of post-rock, they are absolute masters of building atmosphere and when they let rip it sounds like your very own personal apocalypse is blasting out of your headphones. Sinister strings, dread infused samples, evil sounding guitar tones - what more could you want from a symphonic instrumental rock act?<br /><br />Ok, so even if you consider the two drone pieces included here as merely pleasant diversions the two meaty 20 minute plus compositions are all-conquering thundering behemoths of noise. I still can't decide which is my favourite of the two - 'Mladic' sports Middle Eastern riffs so ferocious in their execution they sound like they were written to snake charm Nessie while the last 8 and a half minutes of 'We Drift Like Worried Fire' might just be the band's best ever recorded moment, a truly astounding mix of military drums, eerily squealing guitar noises, soaring strings and ecstatic riffing.<br /><br />It would have been a travesty if these songs had never been put down on tape and I'm so pleased the band got back into the studio after over ten years away to deliver the Godspeed goods. Go get.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I loved this book.  I am a huge John Corey fan and I was pleasantly surprised that Paul Brenner was in this story as well.  It's good to know that there will most likely be another book with Chet in it.  Damn those CIA agents!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have used this app for a year now and I love it. Angle Labs has done a great job. I like being woke up as the alarm starts low and keeps getting louder, which is adjustable on the amount of time it takes to get loud. Everything on this alarm clock is customizable. The ringer, time to max volume, color theme, brightness, snooze button size, number of snoozes, force on sound even if the phone is muted, unlock screen when alarm is sounding and even if headphones are plugged in it can be used to force the sound on (works on most devices). Vacation mode when you are in a different location alarm does not come on (if option is selected). Repeat alarm any day of the week. Have multiple alarms. Has a count down timer and many more options. This is just the FREE version. I am going to buy this app to support Angle Labs and to get even more options. Check out Volume Manager. I bought this Angle Labs app and use it a lot also.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was great reading about the whole event and to get a better understanding about the life of a seal.  The quality of the writhing could have been better but it wasn't that bad.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I LOVE this printer.[[ASIN:B005O55T98 HP Photosmart 6510 e-All-in-One Printer (B211a)]]! It was easy to set up and I love the eprint. I work for a retail electronics store, and I highly recommend this product!
0805047905|5.0|This was a favorite for our daughter at a very young age! She loved it starting at 6 months old and continues to actively read it.
0761163808|5.0|When I first saw the photicular technology that made this book possible I was really quite impressed.  The DIY technology is compelling enough that one could spend an hour or so just flipping back and forth through the pages, saying \\"how the heck did he do that.\\"  And for kids?  Forget about it!  The fascination is potentially endless.  So I was sold just on the tech alone.<br />But when I got past the tech to the actual 'book' I found a nicely written history of the 'Safari,' from \\"Out of Africa\\" and elephant guns, to the introduction of the modern conservation ethic and the desire to see wildlife without bringing home a pelt to remember the journey.  to make it better, each illustration comes with a 'baseball card' full of information about each animal.<br />It's a wonderful journey, a fascinating technological accomplishment and if it's sitting around on your coffee table, you can't help but flip through it.  If you're looking for a cool gift, this is it.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|Bought this item as gift.  So cannot make a comment on this item at this time.  But the price was right.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Just received my New Kindle Fire HD and the Marware Vibe Standing Case...in ORANGE (my favorite color!) Love the look and feel of the case.  it helps to protect my Kindle and it stands on a desk top for easy viewing.  I would recommend this product for the quality and a Great price!
