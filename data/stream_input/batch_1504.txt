B007J4T2G8|3.0|Wasn't as impressed as everyone else seems to be. The writing leaves a lot to be desired.<br />It was ok for a quick read & to check out what all the hype is about.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|I have bought this book for someone but didn`t notice it you have to choose first send as a gift, now i could not send to via email If anyone knows how to send it to someone`s email address??<br /><br />Thanks in advance
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Would have loved to watch this movie but, entirely too much foul langauge !! Had to turn it off !
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Enjoy the grand plethora of minigames but not too crazy about the ads. Also some kinds of User account would be very helpful.  I just &quot;earned&quot; 2 of the exclusive million point games. unfortunately my kindle died and I have no way to get them back. Besides that I really enjoy this app
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Just watched it through Amazon's Instant Videos & it is a fantastic movie!!! I do not know why the critics gave it such bad reviews! It had everything a great movie should have - plot, comedy, romance, & action! I love it! Disney did a great job! I will definitely buy this movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|the game is really fun and is the best thing to play if you want to stimilate your mind. I play it often
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app to use very simple and easy, I like being to use it on my kindle fire for the big screen
B004ZJZPZC|1.0|Despite the title of the listing there is NO DVD inlcuded in this edition. There is a Blu Ray Disk and a \\"Digital DVD\\" which is only there to download the digital copy. There is NO regular DVD. In addition, the digital download has EXPIRED. Don't waste your money, just buy the regular Blu Ray disk of this great movey. That's all you will end up with in this release anyway. Very very disappointing that AMAZON lists this incorrectly as including a DVD as well as a useable digital copy.
1594744769|5.0|This novel is such a wonderful mixture of fabulous writing and exquisite visual art.  The story was engaging - more like gripping...or impelling - and drew me through the story at high speed.  The characters and the drama of their lives was both sympathetic and delightful.  I bought ths book for my 14 year old son.  So, at 60, I guess I can claim to sufficiently young at heart to be enthralled by this story.  Clearly written with a sequel in mind, I was left with the satisfaction that the story of these peculiar children is not ended.  By the way, the photos were a wonderful addition to the story...what a stroke of genius...even if unintended.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an awesome story!  God bless the USA!  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about the training of a NAVY SEAL and a true war conflict.  We are truly lucky to have had Marcus and the NAVY SEAL team fighting and dying for our country. USA...USA...USA
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|I really like this movie. It isn't a dialog driven or even a thinking movie. It is a action thriller that keeps you involved and entertained.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I think the book is awesome. The character seems to be pursuing just a  better place. It is a call for humbleness. Love it
B005OK728O|5.0|SAME AS HOSTEL 2...IF YOU LIKE GORY MOVIES LIKE THIS YOU WILL LOVE THIS. CRAZY MOVIES BUT SCARY GOOD. I ENJOYED THIS TILL THE END...LITERALY.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|Adam has compiled a super album again.  This time, it's for dancing!  It's rare that I get up and \\"move\\" (I'm 65), but I just can't help myself when this CD[[ASIN:B0080OJBQW Trespassing (Deluxe Version) [+digital booklet]]] is playing!  This boy has a serious over-the-top voice that doesn't quit giving.  Even if you didn't care for his first album, give this one a spin.  Enjoy life with Adam!  You'll be glad you tried it.  He just keeps on giving his all.  Love this boy.
B004LWZW6U|5.0|This is MUCH better than the first movie...much funnier! It is well worth the time watching and is good for a laugh. This must be great in 3D, but I don't see it having much staying power in the theaters, but online it sure will!
B006N9KFPC|5.0|This album is awesome. Even if you are not an Adam fan but love rock/pop this is the album for you. On first play the amazing ballads stand out, in particular the track \\"Underneath\\". Adam really bares his soul in that song. Like one of the other reviewers has said, the title track \\"Trespassing\\" is reminiscent of Queen's \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\". This CD gives more every time you listen to it; it just gets better. I have the deluxe album and I'm very glad I bought this version as one of the highlights of the CD is the bonus track \\"Runnin\\"; this song really rocks. If you are still unsure about buying \\"Trespassing\\" check out \\"Adam Lambert @ Heaven\\" videos posted by another person on You Tube. Enjoy.
1469984202|5.0|Been a SciFi and Fantasy novel reader for 35 years and I loved this book. It's not often that I get nervous for characters when reading a novel but I did with this one.  Several times I had to put it down and go for a walk before I could read it again - I was starting to speed read to find out what happened next.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the most fun game I have. With the stimulation of using you reflexes it make it a very suspencefull. You must be quick and use hand-eye coordination in order to succeed.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|so far it's been great. still need to play with it more, but that'll take some time. definitely worth looking at
B0086700CM|5.0|i love that no matter hoe high a score you get you keep trying to one up yourself over and over. never gets old
1577314808|5.0|There may be many people who are not ready to hear this type of information, or who will refuse to believe it, but it proved to be invaluable to me.  Hands down the biggest life changer my life has experienced in book form.  If you're searching for happiness and/or enlightenment, this may be the most important book in your journey, as it was for mine.  This was the most important element in what ultimately ended my 30 year streak of depression.  Now I'm turning 32, and I've literally never felt happier and more at peace.  I would love it if every person in the world read this book, but as I said, it may not be for everyone.  All I can say is that it was extremely helpful for me.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have to admit that the movie was great but the DVD/Blu-ray was even better!  It has this really cool feature that allows you to download an IPAD application and have an interactive experience with the movie while it is playing!  I have bought a number of DVDs and Blu-rays and this one really blows them all out of the water.  With a great story line, John Carter draws in both science fiction fans as well as those who enjoy action and a strong female character who is desperately trying to save her planet.  If you missed John Carter in the theatres, this is a real keeper.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Really enjoyed it, a great quick read. This has been my favourite of Marian's books, but they are all great reads!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am enjoying this game on my kindle:) If you are a solitaire fan you will too. So try it
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|This is by far the most action packed movie in the saga so far! It is non stop action from the start. Kate beckinsale is by far the best actress for the movies!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was truly amazing! Such a great story told from a dogs perspective which is really cool. I've never read a book like that and I ended up being so good!
B007XWFZSA|5.0|I'd been to Victor's website and never really went in depth into his method for case interviews and frankly just hated receiving all his spam mails. I've read case in point and followed Cosentino's method for a little while, but always thought that his method was just a lot of frameworks that needed to be memorized, not a flexible system. This book was awesome and filled all the gaps that other case prep books/instructors missed. Victor presents a simple yet sophisticated casing method that is applicable to 99% of cases you'll encounter
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Simply , one of the best rock albums put out by anyone in some time. Would love to see this album live from start to finish.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love all the different effects u can do to ur pictures with this app!!  It is so Awesome.  I  especially love the color Slash and there loving the new corrections featue!!
B002PTNY7A|3.0|This movie has some very interesting concepts and a few interesting cinematic effects.  I guess that I'd characterize it more in the category of \\"chick flick\\" than anything else.  It shows emotion and relationships.  If you're in the mood for something like that, it's worth the view!  Don't come to it with expectation of anything intellectual or action-oriented.  Anyone with strong religious convictions will likely find it unsuitable--it doesn't really meet any church dogma that I'm familiar with.  Just sit back and watch it for fun and for the utterly unique storyline.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|absolute joy. My life is organised.  love the email feature too. I would recommend this app to anyone. Get IT!
0553801473|4.0|Not as great as Sword storms, but better than Feast of crows. Tyrion's character seems a little different after everything he's been through. You can also see a more mature Jon Snow.<br />And as usual, Martin has the power to make the reader not stop reading
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I had a really good time plaint this. game its awesome I'm on wave 30. a u I o p j v
B0052VUNHC|5.0|From the very first page of this book I was hooked... this book will be one that I proudly dispaly on my bookshelf and shove in everyones face making them read it.<br /><br />Abby moved half away around the world to get away with her best friend America and make a new start at college, her first day she meets Travis Maddox the college tramp and bad boy with tattoos and an attitude to matech thus begins the story. From the beginning Travis is infatuated with Abby but she wants nothing to do with him. So they make a bet if Abby wins he must be celibate for a month and if he wins she must live in his apartment for a month instead. This book is not your typical gooey love story it delves deeply into love in all forms. Its dysfuntiual and raw and heartbreaking it really is a Beautiful Diaster.  I couldnt put this book down I had to know what happened. You will not be dissapointed by this book its just fantastic. I laughed I cryed man i threw my kindle across the room a few times. Simply put Beautiful Diaster is just BEAUTIFUL .. I can not wait til Travis's POV is released &lt;3
B002UBRFDC|3.0|I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, and enjoy reading long, epic novels.  Based on all of the 5 star reviews, I thought I would love this book.  Unfortunately, I didn't.  The overall premise of the story is good, but I found the plot to be slow moving, tedious, and confusing at times.  There were far too many \\"traps\\" and secret alliances between the characters to keep straight.  Very often, I found myself having to go back and re-read several paragraphs to figure out what was going on.  When I finished the book, I was glad to be done with it.  I do not see myself ever reading it again, as so many other reviewers claim to do.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|this movie is the most amazing movie I have ever seen..The action is jam packed from beginning to end..the one downfall of when I ordered it was the price dropped almost 10.00 overnight so I paid more for it
B002BWP49C|5.0|love the books.  love the movies. the story of bella and edwawrd and jacob is one that is pure.  Stephani Myers has created a cast and characters that show true love and shows that a young person can wait for their wedding day to enjoy the secrets of being married.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|The movie is good, I've seen it once before, but wanted to actually own it since I liked it.  I recently purchased a 3D Blue Ray player and wanted a few more 3D movies.  I was disappointed that there was very few 3D effects and some if not most scenes didn't have any 3D effects.  If you are looking for a nice 3D movie, this is not the one for you.
0545265355|5.0|I saw the movie and had to go buy the books.  This is some of the best reading i've done since the twilight series. Riveting. Suspenseful.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is a well written easy to follow book, not a topic that I enjoyed.  I did not read any other reviews but trusted some fellow workers that this was a book I would enjoy. I did not care for the topic at all.  I don't like reading about stupid women.
B004QL7K6G|3.0|\\"We prefer 'intentional community. We're not a bunch of hippies sitting<br />around playing guitar.\\" George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) are finally<br />starting to relax. George has a great job and Linda is an aspiring<br />filmmaker who is set to sell her documentary to HBO. They buy a house in<br />one of the nicest parts of New York City and everything is going great.<br />When everything falls apart they move to Atlanta to live with George's<br />brother. Along the way the find a commune called Elysium with a very<br />eclectic group of people. They find more then the expected there. This<br />is a very funny movie but it is not for everyone. This is the type of<br />comedy where if you offend easy I would avoid it. Like most movies by<br />Apatow or Rudd the dialog is so great that you find it hard not to<br />laugh at the lines or the delivery of them. The cast is great in this<br />and everyone adds their own brand of comedy but at the same time no one<br />really gets in the way of the others. Just as a heads up though there<br />is a lot of full frontal male nudity in this, but its really funny when<br />it happens. I laughed threw the entire movie and there are a ton of<br />quotable lines in this, but this is not a movie I would buy. Overall, a<br />very funny movie that fans of Apatow will love. I give it a B+.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is about a young woman, Anastasia Steele, encountering a mysterious and powerful man, Christian Grey, and their frought journey into  love and intimacy. It is a very scary journey for Ana and for the reader, as E.L. James brings you along for the ride. It is a classic romance because the story is all about the relationship between Ana and Christian, full stop. The author explores this relationship with explicit and disturbing sexual encounters. I have read other reviews that don't get that this is about the relationship, not the sex. In fact all of the press about this book is about the sex--huge mistake in trying to figure out why this book is so popular. The reason I gave this five stars is because the author is very successful in getting inside Ana's mind. She has EXACTLY the same emotions I would have if I was in her situation. The deeply disturbing part for the reader, is that this feels like reality in that we don't know where it is going to go; how far will Ana let Christian drag her into his world of BDSM? How much will Ana give up of her soul to keep Christian? How does Christian change Ana? How does Ana change Christian? If you don't like the Romance Genre--books about relationships--you won't like this book, If you do, you will love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to buy this book because everyone said it was so good and it is one of the most popular books right now. I am sad to say it is horrible! I read the first 7 chapters then the book just gets all kinky and creepy. I had to stop reading it because it was disturbing. I would give it less than one star if I could. I wish I could get my $9 back too. I definitley would not recommend to a friend.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a good app. I like it. this app is fun. this app deserves five stars. I love this app

B007TNS6JI|5.0|this is a fantastic game.  there's not much more to say about it.  sometimes it freezes, but not all games are perfect.  if you buy stuff, I think the prices are pretty fair.
0231161166|5.0|What a refreshingly erudite and informative book!  It was in-depth, at times jam packed with information, particularly for a person with no biology background, but the author went to great length to explain in a very understandable manner some of the complexity of epigenetics, genetics and the current state of our knowledge about these subjects.  I highly recommend this book for the interested reader.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|all of you who are angry at kids buying stuff through the game, its your own fault.  if you had the password on, then they couldn't buy stuff.

1612130283|2.0|I finally got around to reading this story after so many of my friends and co-workers encouraged me to do so.  I was thoroughly disappointed by this book.  The entire story is unbelievable.  Ana, a college student, meets Christian Grey when she goes to interview him for her college newspaper.<br /><br />A few days later they meet again at a photo shoot.  Then days later she calls him drunk and he runs to her rescue.  Christian isn't just a good looking man; he's a billionaire, a concert pianist, a pilot, a philanthropist, adopted, and all by the age of 27.<br /><br />For a novel that is being sold as SMBD, it certainly doesn't get into much of it.  It is very tame in comparison to other books I have read in this genre.  The writing is also awful.  The author feels the need to repeat everything is this book from phrases, to mannerisms, to the sex scenes.<br /><br />I got to the point where if Christian told Ana to stop biting her lip because she knew what it did to him one more time I would have thrown the book away.  That, combined with her inner goddess, were too much for me.<br /><br />The book is not difficult to read and there are glimpses of the writing that I wanted to see in this book, but it wasn't enough.  Overall I felt this book was boring and repetitive.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very entertaining. Its a reflex based game that gets harder the longer the game goes on. My only suggestion would be to change the environment he's running in as time goes on as well. It gets a little boring knowing that I have to keep overcoming the same obstacles over and over. Overall, great game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a basic calculator with large numbers.  This is it.  Enjoy the layout and the color.  Easy to use.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Books 1-3 sucked me in. The only reason I was able to get through this entire book was that I must finish that story, but unfortunately a lot of the excitement was lost for me with this read.<br /><br />For starters, how I missed Tyrion! Not just that, but so many characters you know about and want to follow their stories, but instead we keep getting new characters which are nowhere near as interesting (one chapter in Dorne would've sufficed). The whole book is littered with filler, and it never really seems to get to the good stuff.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'm in this thing to the end now. We'll see how the last books fare.
0316098329|1.0|Once you read the one paragraph synopsis, you've read the book.  The only part of the book worthy of praise is the concept.<br /><br />In the hands of a skilled author, I suppose it could have been more.  I read 50 or so novels a year, and once a year or so, I read one where I say, \\"I could have written this.\\", because it simply isn't written that well.<br /><br />And YOU as well, probably could have written this if given the subject idea by the author.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I don't get those pop ups where it asks you to buy gems. which most of you guys are complaining. but sometimes when I load the game it shows a green blank screen. otherwise the game is fun.  don't hesitate to get it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting. I'm so glad my friend introduced it to me! The tutorials are great and I learner quickly but this game takes time. And practice. LOTS.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|I own 55 Blu-ray discs, a this is the first one that will not play on my Blu-ray player. I order two of these discs, and I had to send both back to Amazon for a refund.

B007MDQW3W|5.0|I've read some reviews saying that Regina Spektor's 2009 album, Far was her most accessible but I would argue that she has never sounded more radio friendly then on some of the songs on this album. I've enjoyed Regina's work since Soviet Kitsch and even though there are still some of the quirky songs on this album, I would say this is her most pop sounding record. Songs like \\"Don't Leve Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)\\" and \\"Patron Saint\\" are the best examples of songs that could appeal to mainstream listeners but also on tracks such as \\"Firewood\\" and \\"How\\" are some of the most moving ballads that Regina has ever written and I would say could be hits with radio. Of course, there are still the strange and darker songs like \\"All The Rowboats\\" and \\"Open\\".<br /><br />I've enjoyed all of Regina's work so far. She never dissapoints and is a gifted talent. This record shows how well she has grown into an amazing writer of more commercial songs but still stay true to her unique style which is equally amazing. I loved Begin To Hope and Far and this new record is another winner. It's only 36 mintues long but is worth every second. Well done Regina!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|The Alien series has got to be the best Sci-fi and horror has ever offered, bar none. Having the original monster set of The Alien Quadrilogy, and with the advent of Blu-ray well, the Alien Anthology is a must have for any Alien fan. I decided on the import offering mainly due to it being lesser priced than the US release, and was a bit concerned it may not work with my Blu-ray player, but every disc works perfectly. My only issue with the Blu-ray set is that ALIENS(film 2), while in wide screen format, is not Letterbox as the other films and the picture quality does take a bit of a hit. But otherwise, this is THE set to have in your collection. The bonus material and extras are off the hook and you can spend hours and hours exploring the Alien world and how it all came to be.<br /><br />One comical note is that there are two warnings on the packaging from the Irish Film classification Office. the first states the Blu-ray set is 'Fit for viewing by persons aged are 18 years or more.' The second states, 'Suitable only for persons of 18 years and over. Not to be supplied to any person below that age.'<br /><br />One suggestion to you ... get this set. It is the perfect beast!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book was very good. It will make you want to read the book in one day. I couldn't put this book down.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game has quickly become my favorite puzzle game. It keeps you engaged and I quickly found myself starting the next puzzle because I didn't want to stop.
B0044RUSZM|3.0|I liked this Griffin Elevator Laptop Stand right out of the box: it was packed flat in a compact box, but easy to assemble once I opened it. It's a great height for me, and because the base is three sided, you could easily set it on top of a book if you needed more height.<br /><br />What I DON'T like about it, and why I'm only rating it a three, is that the top clips -- that keep the laptop from sliding down -- are perpetually slipping out of place themselves, though, as some have said, you really don't need them. But you DO need the clear bar across the bottom, and that slips around quite a bit too.<br /><br />Otherwise, great minimalist design.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|I used to think that \\"The Tempest\\" read better than it played.<br /><br />This movie proved me wrong.  Yes, all the lovely poetry is there, but the production sparkles.<br /><br />Casting Prospero as Prospera was a brainwave.  Prospero's crustiness and wordiness and sheer grumpiness are softened, making him--here, her--a likable character at last.  And not only likable, but sympathetic.  Helen Mirren does a great job with difficult lines--mainly by plowing straight ahead and letting the sense come as it will.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally good.  David Straithairn is perfect as Alonso, the sad, almost morose King of Naples.  Chris Cooper is believably Machiavellian as Prospera's brother Antonio, who stole her dukedom long ago.  The wonderful Alan Cumming is great as Alonso's treacherous (though not very bright) brother.<br /><br />Felicity Jones is suitably dewy as Miranda, and Reeve Carney is unbelievably young and perfect for Ferdinand.<br /><br />Russell Brand, Alfred Molina, and Djimon Hounsou practically steal the show as Trinculo, Stephano, and Caliban.<br /><br />But the best thing about this production--and that's saying a lot--is the setting.  The whole thing is gorgeous and suitably magical, from the lava rocks and swamps and barrens of the island to the wonderful cave and magic pool of Prospera.  Ben Whishaw is great as Ariel, but even better are the leaping special effects that make him androgynous, and transform him from sweet spirit to horrible harpy.<br /><br />The one, minor, false note is the animated Hounds of Hell.  But this is negligible.<br /><br />All in all, a splendid rendition.  If you like the play--and even if you don't--you will love this version.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this series, and am now completely obcessed with it. I've never been much of a reader, but when I started I couldn't put it down I finished all three books in just over a week and have read them twice now. The characters in this book are just awesome and the writer makes you feel like you are actually in the story!! I know some people are not as into it as I obviously am, but I am head over heels in love with Fifty Shades!! Hope this helps you make a decision, Laters Baby!!!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|Pleased with this CD. It is a good compilation of Santana's greatest hits. It covers his music through the years very well.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Jake Epping has just gotten through a divorce with his alcoholic life and is ready to settle into his mundane life as sing, high school English teacher.  Things seem to be following the pattern he expects until his friend Al lets him in on a secret, he can travel back in time and has plans to change the world.  The only problem is that Al can't finish what he started and he convinces Jake to go back and stop the JKF assassination. Every action has a reaction though, and it isn't long before Jake realizes changing the past may not be the gift Al expected it to be.<br /><br />This book reminded me a little of King's earlier \\"Dead Zone\\" although the book offers enough twists and turns to keep it from sounded like a rehash of an earlier King plot.  At over 800 pages King maintains his reputation for being able to stretch out a plot for all it's worth without the action dragging.  Once again King delivers a speculative fiction novel which offers both suspense and something to think about.  It's obvious he's done his homework about potential histories and what would have happened politically and world-wide if John F. Kennedy hadn't been assassinated.  Without giving any of the ending away, the future world he creates leaves you with a lot to think about even after Jake goes on his final journey down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />The book was as well written and the characters as vibrant as you would expect from any other King novel. I can't say this is one of my favorite King novels by a long shot.  The story is not quite as fast paced as some of his others and while the pacing is done superbly there are still sections that I had to force myself to get through.  If you're more of a fan of King's horror than his science fiction you may find this book a little slow for your tastes, but if you have the time this summer it's well worth picking it up.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Christine loses her memories every night when she falls asleep.  She wakes up every morning with no idea of who she is, how old she is, or who the man she's sleeping next to is.  After getting a call from Dr. Ed Nash who claims he might be able to help her, Christine starts keeping a journal for herself so she can write down everything she remembers before it's wiped away the next day.  The more she journals the more she realizes her husband hasn't been telling her the whole truth about her life but without her memories she has no way to know for sure.<br /><br />Written in gripping first person Watson's debut novel was impossible to put down.  Each chapter is written as Christine's journal entry and as the pieces start to fall into place you will be amazed.  Watson has expertly weaved together fragments of Christine's life into snippets of memory that enable you to try and solve the mystery along with Christine while not having quite enough information to know for sure (although if you're anything like me you'll be guessing through the book).  Not only has Watson created a shocking mystery/thriller, but she also captures the emotions of Christine and the people in her life with delicacy.  While Christine's case seems beyond belief Watson has created enough reality to hold onto that it isn't hard to believe.<br /><br />I didn't expect to finish this book in one day, but after the first 50 pages I couldn't put it down.  I have nothing but good things to say about this book and I am looking forward to Watson's next novel with baited breath.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is an unforgetable concert. The talent is amazing. Nick Jonas was a little weak, but I think as he matures and has a bit more broadway experience he will be much better. At the end of the concert, the original 1985 cast, joins the company on stage and sings some of the better known and loved songs.A quartet combining  Alfie Boe, Colom Wilkinson,Simon Bowman and John Owen-Jones, the best known men to portray Jean Valjean,sing 'Bring Him Home', and is actually my favorite part. Even after 25 years, Colom Wilkinson can bring tears to your eyes. They are all so, so good. You can see it on UTube, 'Valjean Quartet'. Don't eventhink. If you like Les Mis, buy this DVD.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|...it was must better! I might not be the right person to review this book because I just love this kind of stories but nontheless when you think you've seen it all and nothing is going to suprise you , sometimes you get it wrong! this was one of those situations, I started reading these books , honestly, because there was so must going on about them, they're even making a TV production out of this so I thought :\\" why not? you don't realy have anything better to read right now.\\" I couldn't be happier with my choice. This isn't only another fantasy / epic story. this is must bigger! It has realy characters, and it makes you think that this could realy be a biography if it weren't for the dragons.<br />I was sad to hear that this book didn't foccus on some of my favourite characters but I adore it even more because it shows you another point of view and I have to say I realy understood must of why some characters are like they are! That is another great thing about the writer, when you beging to hate, like realy hate, a character you're confronted with his/her story and you put things in another perspective. That only shows the fact that the circunstances makes for must of our character !<br />So I've think I've said enough. just buy the book and don't stop till you've finished, you won't regret it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I decided to read this even after seeing the awful reviews. I thought that it's something that I should read cause everyone else was hah. The repetition does get to you. Ana's choice of swear words is hilarious (I mean, \\"Double Crap\\" and \\"Holy Crapola\\"? Really?). I like the idea of the woman trying to turn the tables on the man. So it's sort of like two playing each other's own game and trying to outsmart each other. But the way Ana and Christian go about it.....it makes me want to beat them both. They are so stupid. Ana is a ditz, completely unaware of her surroundings. Just how did she get past high school and college. Everything makes her blush. The way that it's written, it reads like a teenager's fantasy journal. I still want to know what happens, but having to read it is rough. It's just terrible, it's mind numbing in the bad way. I try to look past the bad writing and enjoy the story...but you can only do that for so long. The ending of the first book was anti-climactic. It could have been dramatic, but the author's choice of words let it down.

B005LAIGWS|1.0|Supposed to be a squeal of the first movie, it isn't, Doesn't even follow the comics, the writers/director/producer should have watched the first movie and/or read the comics before making this.
B0057R5XRG|2.0|1st movie...<br /><br />I cannot state harshly enough my disgust when major money makers like these films come to Blu-Ray with lousy, GRAINY picture quality... Totally ruins my viewing experience. Every single indoor scene with low lighting... GRAINY!!! Every outdoor scene with back lighting... GRAIN! Every outdoor scene with low lighting... GRAIN!!!<br /><br />2nd and 3rd movies...<br /><br />Grain Not as bad... Some scenes a little blury tho. Sound quality is fine.<br /><br />Over all... it's good I got this set on sale!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like the app, especially its ability to sync all platforms. I just wish it was a little more full featured like OneNote. If OneNote was on Aneroid I would use it instead.
B0086700CM|1.0|last update made me loose all my progress...now i have to start all over...very laggy and stops in middle of game. very frustrating....uninstalling
B003QCCS36|4.0|I heard Devil's in the Jukebox on Pandora, that is a real up-tempo blues/country rocker and Ray's husky voice fits that so perfectly.  So when I got this disc I was a little surprised by how slow and atmospheric most of the album is.  It starts out with a great break up song full of intensity, Repo Man, but you won't hear anything else with any energy to it until the last track.  That said, there are some real gems here including the title track which doesn't have a bridge and sounds so direct because of it.  Some songs are pretty wispy.  Overall, I do like that there is a committment to the songwriting and the execution, just don't be surprised if you fall asleep before the end!
145210655X|5.0|This adorable book features clever and hilarious parodies of many memorable Star Wars moments.  It'll make the perfect Father's Day or birthday present for any Star Wars loving dad in your life.  I purchased this for my husband for his birthday and he absolutely loved it!
B0035V35PI|5.0|The only reason I watched this is because of Rain. I LOVE his music and have watched all of his Korean Dramas as well. I was happy to watch him play Raizo and he played the role well. For those of you who don't know Rain is HUGE in S Korea and have sold out concerts in America as well!! If you ever get a chance to see him perform you will know why. This movie isn't for the weak stomach there is lots of bloody gore scenes. The plot is so-so but they make it work. But I have to support my favorite K POP Superstar. I'm happy to say his music videos GET heavy rotation in my IPOD on a daily basis.
1469984202|5.0|It really is as good as they say. This is the first sci-fi book I've read to the end in a long time. I expect and hope they make a movie of it next.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a challenging, addictive game! I recomend it for anyone who loves fast-pace games and needs a fun game.
B00006FDCD|3.0|This DVD is edited and missing about 5 minutes. I have the laserdisc and its got opening credits on Side 3 which is Side 2 of the dvd and has a scene where Richard Thomas arrives in Derry and goes to a bookstore before he takes the taxi to the cemetery which is completely cut out of the dvd. The Laserdisc is 192 minutes and the DVD is 188 minutes.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Its okay because when I'm trying to build a building I have no money and I can't get past the level. So that is just really great
B005LAIGW8|1.0|Some demonic possessed evil is responsible for this non-creative (i.e. heavily borrowed) writing, directing and robotic acting and needs to be constrained by a zinc coffin and tossed into the Mariana Trench. This evil intends to zombify us all with another Exorcist II style bad child with evil connections and with the usual black robed worshippers in a semicircle with the usual incantations. The usual, don't sell your soul, or you'll die to regret it with the usual monk sacrifice. The only redeeming part is of course a couple of minutes of CGI burning skeleton on burning 'cycle. How we humans continue to be mesmerized by fire. I'm so inspired I think I'll go and put a match to a lighter fluid doused Halloween skeleton on a toy motorcycle.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Well this app has great features and bad features. I have it on the kindle fire and I just don't understand it at all.  Good: You can download youtube videos from your browser and put them into your gallery to listen/ watch without WiFi. Bad: It just pops up random videos. That's it. Point blank random videos. So I reccomend it for the gallery but, that's about it.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I love to sit in the car and play this game and for anyone who wonders if they will like this game in my opinion they will love this game and that is why I recomend this game for anyone who likes fruit ninja
0393330435|2.0|Given the book was written by Woz himself I was expecting to read a lot of technical stories.<br />What we got thought is more a prank list and a few technical stories.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|works fine on a home network, however you cannont connect remotely on Verizon 4g without &quot;port forwarding&quot; which is a pita... after I wasted a hour of my life trying to connect I'm done this app is junk...
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Redshirts is an entertaining, interesting twist on the concept of the disposable character.  The book is fun, but more pulp than anything.  Scalzi can write deeper and more interesting characters, and I was bummed not to get that from this one.  Still, a nice and easy light read, took me all of a day and a half to breeze through.<br /><br />The book itself is a three star average book, the Codas give it the extra star.  I enjoyed them more than the book.  Even though they were very short, they were sweet and added some perspective to a few of the loose ends.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|TO could not but down the book,  every were I go I took my kindle or I read on my iPhone.  I hope this author writes more .  He is an amazing author
B00821PEYG|5.0|I knew I would love this series becausee the creator of the story also did the sci-fi series Taken.  I adored that one also and highly recommend it.  Falling Skies is great investment of time. I highly recommend this indulgence.

B00005LK1Q|4.0|Over the years, Tales from Topographic Oceans has become synonymous with, and symbolic of, the beginning of the end of progressive rock as a dominant force in mainstream music. In many ways this accusation is spot on: the work is at times overwrought, sprawling, overly ambitious and as a result often lacks the spontaneity of inspired creativity. Still once you get past the problems and preconceptions, there's a lot of great music to be found throughout the majority of this 2 disc set. The bad first: track three, 'The Ancient Giants under the Sun', in my opinion totally misses the mark (I know they tried to make it a scherzo, but to my ears it's primarily a mishmash of ambience and rhythmic experimentation and it doesn't really work for me.)  Things improve though: there are sections of the second and fourth tracks ('Remembering High - The Memory' and 'Ritual - Nous Sommes du Soleil', respectively) that are great in stretches, but overall disjointed in terms of construction. Yes went to great lengths to introduce numerous musical motifs which recur throughout the entire 2 album set, but they are often overly forced and poorly integrated. And now for the good: the first track, 'The Revealing Science of God - Dance of the Dawn', is a masterpiece on par with Yes' other great album-side length tracks found throughout their oeuvre, aptly conveying the majesty of the subject matter at hand and rivaling 'Close to the Edge' in overall cohesion, quality and construction.<br /><br />Overall assessment? Tales is a flawed diamond, but is worth owning for the momentary glimpses of greatness it attains. It strikes me that their attempts to fuse classical and rock became even more involved during the composition of this album, except rather than integrating rock with Baroque or late Romantic era classical, they seem to have attempted to progress towards a fusion of rock with a form of classical that sounds more like the twentieth century works of Britten and the like. Don't get mewrong - it's admirable that they tried to keep growing and pushing boundaries musically, but it's just not a total success in my estimation. I think they simply bit off more than they could chew, as it were. Another point: I think if they'd instead edited the end result down to a single LP in the 40-45 minute range they'd have been better off; they may have even ended up with something quite amazing. Unfortunately one of the more vocal dissident band members, drummer Bill Bruford, had left to join King Crimson after the completion of Close to the Edge, so maybe they no longer had the self-perspective necessary to do some much-needed work in the editing room. In Bruford's place we have Alan White, who's perfectly competent but nowhere near Bruford's talent level.<br /><br />Other than White, the rest of the \\"classic\\" lineup is intact, with Steve Howe on guitar, Jon Anderson on vocals, Rick Wakeman manning his army of keyboards, Chris Squire on bass and the aforementioned White on drums. Even with the loss of Bruford, this was a band to be reckoned with, capable of ensemble play and technique few if any bands of the day could match.<br /><br />This Japanese mini-LP HDCD edition really sounds great. The packaging is gorgeous, an exact replica of the original LP, including all of the original artwork and inserts. Truthfully these HDCD discs are a little up and down in terms of quality from release to release. For example Fragile isn't that great; and Close to the Edge is downright awful. But this particular release is excellent, and Relayer sounds quite good as well. You'll see the odd review here and there complaining of sporadic dropouts across these releases, but the overall sound quality makes a couple of split-second drops over 80 minutes more than tolerable, at least as far as I'm concerned. If you have an HDCD player, all the better - the extra bits added at the high and low end make a difference. It's nice hearing Chris Squire's bass up front and prominent in the mix, as well as that \\"air\\" and \\"space\\" often missing from the high-end on standard redbook CDs.<br /><br />If you really want to hear this music in the best sound quality available, this is the clear choice. I've heard just about every release of this album there is, including the original Diament-mastered Atlantic disc, the 1994 (Atlantic) and 2003 (Rhino) remasters, the SHM-CD and this HDCD, so I'm not just saying it without careful consideration. If you don't want to spend a premium though, the original Diament Atlantic & the Rhino remaster both sound pretty good, and both are substantially cheaper. I'd certainly recommend this over the shrill, oddly mastered SHM-CDs that came out a few years ago, and the 1994 remaster, which quite honestly isn't even worth considering. Until we get a Gold CD, SACD or DVD-A edition of Tales, this is still the best option currently on the market. Recommended for Yes fanatics.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Very satisfied with this product. Victor Cheng gives in-depth and helpful tips that any aspiring consultant would do well to have. In addition, it was not a dull read as it included interesting anecdotes and real-world applications with the explanation of what case interviewers will be looking for.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought the book was very erotic but after a while, I was more interested in the story than reading about them having sex.  Halfway through, I decided not to buy the next two books in the sequel but by the end of the book, I now might buy them as I felt the story was interesting and had a lot of substance to it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The app is great! I especially like the daily reading plans that you are able to read.  My favorite is the One Minute reading plan.  My only con is the narrator reading the scriptures. His voice is so monotone!! On the flip side I like being able to hear the word when I'm too busy to read for myself.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|This is by far the best movie, besides Jesus of Nazareth and 10 Commandments, that I have ever seen because I grew up with hundreds of dreams flying and moving things with my mind! I enjoy it so much, that I watch it as often as I can.
0547569653|5.0|First off, I'll start be saying that this book appealed to me on many fronts.  I'm a budding runner and someone who loves to run. I'm also struggling to eat and depend less on animal products as a source of protein (for health reasons). And, also, the analytical side of me loves the research that Scott put into creating solutions to beat the competition (he blends scientific, philosophical, and empirical approaches to learn how to \\"Eat and Run\\" better).<br /><br />He takes the reader through many emotional highs, some of his intimate personal troubles, and even near depression.  By the end of the book, I had cheered for him, shed a few tears, was highly inspired, got a few laughs, and picked up some great recipes along the way (hopefully I'll get some use out of them). The warmth and compassion he shows for his mother, his friends, and fellow competitors seemed true and genuine.<br /><br />If running, eating well, or the desire for competitive inspiration are a driving force in your life, I suspect you'll reap the benefits of reading about Scott's life journey.<br /><br />Scott, thanks for a great book!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed the story line but there was just too much sex. Yes, the sex was varied but goodness, multiple times a day almost every day, took away from the book. I was not offended by the content as it definitely gave insight to what some might find enjoyable but it got boring for me,after the first few times, so much so that I found myself skipping through  the sex in book 2 and 3. What kept me interested was wanting him to succeed in getting past his tormented past and enjoying all the good in his life.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was my first time reading Sylvia Day and I found the plot utterly addicting, scorching hot, and her writing quite beautiful and well done. I cannot wait until her next release. This is an author I will be stalking the work of.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I'm not a big one for writing reviews, but I just had to quickly throw my 2 cents in on this one. I must admit, I like Joe Walsh, but I originally ordered this CD due to the fact that Jeff Lynne was involved and I wouldn't miss one of his offerings. And, after listening to this CD all the way through a few times, song for song, it is an awesome purchase!<br /><br />Sure, there are some tunes that I like more than others ... \\"Analog Man\\" and \\"Wrecking Ball\\" are really great rockers. But, I found the songs that truly touched my heart (personally) are \\"Lucky That Way\\", \\"Family\\", and \\"One Day at a Time\\". Anyway, I got the version with the DVD and glad I did. It's hard to find music with thoughtful lyrics that are deeply relatable. This CD is for me ... Give it a try ....
B0086700CM|3.0|this is a good game but the touch screen controls could be a lot better, so you would have to concentrate to be sure you make the turns and jumps for kindle fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think its just awesome u get to help all of Manny Sid and Diego help all of their friends and u also get to play mini games u also get a sneak peak at the ice age 4 movie and its gonna be great.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|SpecWar Navy men are not actors but true American Heros.  This movie was based on actual events. During the funeral scene of their fallen man, the studio left out (due to respect for the family) the \\"resolving\\" of the professional hecklers present.  Details are wasted on Mr. \\"One Star\\".  Those Team Mates were not after a SAG card but rather to get a very lonely and complex story across revealing how far the teams have come from their UDT days to the commissioning of the first two teams in 1962. These memories are vivid in my husbands mind.  What these men do now is phenomenol and they ask nothing in return...and that's just about what they get. To Mr. \\"nationalistic and patriotic overtures propaganda\\" who rated this movie one star...A great story by great men!  Read the ending credits. They were mostly all Navy.  To Mr. \\"One Star\\"...You appear very small in your rating of something you can never begin to relate to.  With your limited capacity for true Nationalism and Patriotism, I think you would fit in better in Cuba!  My Husband is a retired Senior Chief (not fleet) who cut his teeth in Vietnam and stayed in Naval service for 35+ years.  He understood this exceptionally well made DVD and the movie makers were able to bring out the Honor and Pain behind it. As a Navy wife, I understand it and am sad that others can not.  I'll tell you how great this movie is...My hero held back the tears that I could not.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|interesting reminder of being a kid in school. remember spending a good bit of time playing an Oregon's trail game every time I got ahead in class. only played this one a couple of times sp far but enjoying it quite a bit.
B007P4OTHO|5.0|I bought this specifically for the vinyl and was 98% satisfied. The sound of the remaster is excellent and the packaging is great but somewhat different from the original. I heard an eighties pressing of the vinyl album and this version is definitely superior to that. Superior in terms of richness of bass and clarity of instruments. It is not an overly loud remaster like so many post 2000 re-releases. The difference for me that is irratating is the eighties version was not gatefold so i wonder why this one is. I have never seen an original Ziggy lp from 1972 and wonder was it gatefold? I think not. I also didn't like the pocket they created for the dvd audio cd. Vinyl purchasers generally seek packaging that is faithful to the original release and the pocket inside is a definite reminder that this is a modern release. Also the texture of the paper is not the same as 70's style lps. These are minor points however since the record itself is so good. Ziggy Stardust on virgin vinyl is definitely something new so this particular re-release is welcome. It is also great to have a digitally remixed dvd audio and analogue vinyl remaster in one package to compare and debate about with friends. Which media form is better, analogue or digital? For me, it's definitely original analogue that is best.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Suzanne Collins uses language as a blunt tool with short simple sentences. And succeeds. Like a hammer, these short statements drive the point home. The emotional picture is extremely vivid and detailed, far surpassing \\"The Battle Royale\\" or other similar stories like \\"The Most Dangerous Games\\". Yet Suzanne Collins stays away from too graphic descriptions of violence.<br /><br />The main problem with the trilogy? The last book is very weak, with lots of untied ends (who are Cinna and Portia?) and simply unrealistic depiction of the uprising. The scenes feel too contrived and too unnatural. At one point Katniss uses her bow to shoot down hoverplanes, that just happened to be bombing a makeshift hospital while apparently several air-defense machine guns were useless. Come on, that's simply ridiculous and ruins the suspense.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|Having liked the first movie I was anxiously awaiting the release of the sequel. It turned out to be quite a disappointment, aside from some pleasant backdrops. There's nothing sinister about the villain and Holmes doesn't come across as anything special, certainly not the master of deductive reasoning that made the character. The plot was boring and mostly left unresolved.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I was hoping it was a bit more like the real Oregon trail... But I do enjoy playing it.  I just started today, so I will have to update this later.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I am a huge fan of the whole Alien franchise (though not so much the Predator link).  This movie had a good pace and good story (not great..but good).  Those wanting great will be disappointed.  Fans of previous Alien films will probably enjoy this unique perspective about the \\"back story\\" of the original Alien movie. I'm not here to critique the folks who disliked the movie.  They have some good points (that only they can appreciate  ;-) ).  The acting and scenery were fabulous.  The plot surprises were also good (only a few predictable..I have to say).  Too lazy to write a long review here (And good to avoid a potential spoiler slip). SOAP BOX RANT TO FOLLOW: It is too bad that the Motion picture companies have all but abandoned good Sci-Fi movies (like this one...thanks Mr. Ridley!) in favor of comic book heroes, vampires, and big fighting robot movies (yes I'm talking Transformers).  I love this genre but we simply have to wait too long for another good Sci-Fi movie to come out these days.  I hope this changes soon!!!!!
0345803485|3.0|Book is graphic and out of the realm of 'normal' life...I'm sure there are arrangements like this in the real world but not in the world in which I live. I truly enjoy sex with my own husband and the love we share deepens this experience without pain being inflicted. I was introduced to this trilogy by a women's magazine and decided to try the first book and see what all the buzz was about.  I read very rapidly so I rarely quit a book once I start but the only thing which kept me reading was the underlying character development which built throughout the book.  Then the ending obviously was designed to make me purchase the next book in the trilogy and I expect the second book to do the same thing.  Wish all three were contained in one novel...Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" could have also been a trilogy but I appreciate his integrity in making it a novel I can lose myself in for hours.  If a bored housewife wants to experience graphic sexual acts by proxy, this book is the one to read.  Still deciding if I want to invest the time to finish the trilogy, maybe later when those who have bought these novels decide to resell them at a discounted prices...I don't want to recommend this segment of the trilogy as worthwhile in itself but to each their own!
B00006JI11|1.0|I was very dissapointed when I went to play my movie and it didnt want to play due to the fact that it was international. My dvd didnt want to read it also when i tried to play it on my computer it was telling me to change all my settings so that it will play it became very frustrating because i wasnt understanding what to do. I wish in the information provided it would have said this was a german movie instead of americanized that way I would not have wasted my time or money o purchasing this here.
B003Y38YFS|3.0|I do like the look of the sandal and how comfortable it feels but, the front of the sandal near the toes is somewhat a downer. It kept rubbing the top of my middle toes where it gave me a blister. Don't get me wrong I do like wearing it but, not at the cost of giving me a blister on my middle toe. Now I seldom wear the shoes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My first thoughts before purchasing the first book in this series was \\"YUCK! I don't want to read about kinky sex.\\" So I walked away and did not purchase...until a friend with like tastes as mine told me the books were good. I then purchased one to start with. Halfway through that book I decided that maybe I should buy the second one so it would arrive before I finished the first. I always read reviews before purchase and many of them were disgusted with the continuous sex scenes..only focussing in on those but not the story. Yes, there is a goodly amount of sex but much of it is to further the story to show how these two progress through what Christian had to deal with as a child and young adult. It was actually part of the story (except for the one at the end of this book which to me could have been left out)<br /><br />That all being said....I really enjoyed this book and have now started on the third and final one. I laughed a lot and there was some mystery to be solved...still is I might add. If one does not like to read about the sex, one does not have to read those scenes, but keep in mind that they have a purpose to the story. Christian is damaged and Ana is a medicine to his Psyche. It is fun to see how Christian is coming to terms with his past, and I find myself sighing when he is a gentle soul.<br /><br />GOOD STORY. Do not read these out of order though. You need the back story and the progression through the psychological problems. It's all part of the whole.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great game for strategy and mind exercise.  would have liked more instruction on how to play it but it was fun to figure out too.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|not high powered but a simple large button calculator. Great for quick math and tipping. Nice feature that it includes the formula you just solved.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this book is an insult to my intelligence.  totally ridiculously far fetched and stupid.  a waste of money and time  ( even though i read only 100 pages or so).  i am embarrassed gor those who could read it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love the display. so easy to use! the keys are really large so that you don't have to worry about pressing the wrong key.

B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very fun game to play when you have nothing better to do I would recommend this game for anyone
1936608898|5.0|and very easy to read. It simply makes sense and I recommend this book to everyone who is looking to answer that all important questions..\\"but why?\\"

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put these books down...very interesting story line underneath all that steamy love ;) keep an open mind while reading, don't listen to others' bad reviews.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I thought this game was entertaining and the storylinewas pretty cool. I gave it four stars because it could have been a little more challenging but all in all I liked it. My 5 yr old helped a few times. fun
0345803485|5.0|This is one of the best books I ever read... All I can say is WOW and I'm ordering the other two parts!
B0086700CM|5.0|love love love love this game..... I was so excited when I seen it in the app store. my 3 yr old even plays it....
B00845PV16|5.0|Once again I have proved to myself that the critics, detractors & nay sayers are almost always wrong. I almost didn't rent this because of all the negative reviews. However I found it to be a good movie, worth the rental fee. Cage is a nut in a lot of his acting, that's when I like him best. He was pretty nutty in this film, I could tell he was having a good time with it. Script was okay, musical score was neat, CGI was pretty good to excellent, but I will never understand why movies have to be so loud during action scenes, and quite during dialog.<br />Could have done without the comic book/Cage voice overs, but that just added to the campy atmosphere of the movie for me. Good actors without over acting. Of course there is never enough of the female skin for this sexist pig. Could have used just one shot of the leading lady in a wet t-shirt or coming out of a shower.Mmmm

1439192812|5.0|The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True  Richard Dawkins<br /><br />Instead of attacking religious or non science beliefs Dawkins starts each chapter with myths and then shows his insights into the area with help from the illustrator Dave McKean.<br /><br />Starting with the magic of evolution you are asked to imagine your ancestors, going back 1000-greats-grandfather showing a edge on line of pictures.  Then pull out a picture of your 4,000 -greats-grandfather, looks  more like an ape.  For your 50,000 -greats-grandfather you see Homo erectus- what a great way to picture the slow changes of evolution.<br /><br />Dawkins goes on to explain how fossils are formed.  An animal is caught in mud, the mud becomes sedimentary rock and the body rots away you have a hollow imprint.  Sometimes new sediments can enter and form a replica of the animal. A third type is where molecules of the animal are replaced with minerals permanently recording even tiny details of the entire animal.<br /><br />Atoms and molecules are explained historically, explaining everyday solids in terms of the forces holding the nuclei together, and liquids as having nuclei less strongly held. Solids and liquids can't pass through each other, but photons can in a transparent object.<br /><br />The illustrations throughout the book make for much clearer explanations. For instance the actual reason it is warmer during the summer is due to the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation. This tilt presents the portion of the Earth experiencing summer to receive more heat and light during the longer summer days and the rays are more direct, less filtered by the atmosphere since they pass through less atmosphere. They also are more concentrated i.e., hit a smaller area since they are directly overhead.<br /><br />Rainbows are caused when the sun rays from behind us enter spherical raindrops in front of us. The light is refracted, blue light is bent and separated from red which is bent the least. The light is reflected off the far surface of the drop, returns and is refracted again enhancing the rainbow we see. The color we see from each droplet changes as it falls and is replaced by other droplets.<br /><br />You can also take the light from a distant star or galaxy and separate its light into a rainbow using a spectroscope, called a spectra. There are two types: emission which are bright colored lines on a black background, and absorption which are black lines on a rainbow background. Both occur at the same color or wavelength.  They are used to identify elements since each element has its own set of lines.  So you can identify elements in distant stars or galaxies. I was somewhat surprised that he didn't explain that absorption occurs when  electrons absorb a given color(energy) and jump from a lower to a higher energy level in an atom of a specific element.  Emission occurs when the electron jumps back to the same energy level it started from.<br /><br />He shows how the spectra for a given element shift toward the red end when the object is moving away from us. This is an example of the Doppler shift.  A useful application is when a star has a large planet revolving it. The planet has to be large so it perturbs the orbit of its sun enough so our instruments can detect the small Doppler shift it causes.  One can also detect regular changes in the stars light as a planet moves between us and the star.<br /><br />He continues with discussions of the probability of life on other worlds and logically reasons and shows with the huge number of stars and possibly large number of planets some type of life is highly probable.<br />Using the same type of reasoning he develops a logical framework based on Hume's philosophy to test reported happenings or miracles to  test how likely they are.  Or from a different point of view what is the best explanation for the happening.<br /><br />Dawkins presents a very satisfying book filled with very interesting explanations of phenomena around us.  The addition of very clear and in many cases innovative artwork is a real plus. Frequently he will discuss something that is well know like evolution, and give a very clear new way of looking at it. This book is an excellent read.<br /><br />
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This was a beautiful and tragic story.  As a teacher that studies the Holocaust with my class, I appreciated yet another view of the tragedy surrounding this horrific time in our world's history.  Our book club had a great conversation.
0345803493|5.0|Trust me, you'll want to buy all three at the same time. I'm so glad I did because once I started the journey in these books, I was hooked. A well written trilogy to say the least. Laters Baby!
1451673442|4.0|This book \\"The Magic\\" by Rhonda Byrne is, of course, an off shoot of her book \\"The Secret.\\"  \\"The Secret\\" especially the DVD was so well done and so radical that a follow up of the same dimensions as the first is hard to do.  This book differs in that it has exercises to provoke, we hope, deep thought and possibly healing and better habits.  A reading certainly couldn't hurt.
0345803485|5.0|I must  confess, I bought this book because of ask the hype. Well let me tell you, it delivers! Best read in a while. I literally could not put it down. Finished first book in 12 hours, for nd  that's a record. No book in the past has captured my attention so completely! Laters Baby!

B00122J30S|1.0|What happened to the Pumpkins? Oh yeah now I remember, Billy Corgan is a control freak and basically chased the other talented members off, and now that they're all gone he's gathered up a bunch of yes-men to do exactly what he does, and the result is similar to the Star Wars prequels where another egomaniac had total control. Sure he has Jimmy Chamberlin, but right after this album Jim took the high road to get away from Billy 'Ego' Corgan. This isn't the Smashing Pumpkins, the Smashing Pumpkins died with Machina, this is just a travesty.<br /><br />From the appalingly hideous artwork to the poofy \\"We Are Starz\\" lyrics, this album is a testemant to why egomaniacs need someone in their career to keep them straight and say things like \\"I don't think that's a good idea Willy\\" or \\"You're naming the album WHAT?\\". This was my last Pumpkin's album befor I accepted they were dead, and the fact that Billy's calling his next album \\"Teardrop in the Kaleidescope of God's Garden\\" or whatever shows that his ego won't stop expanding.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've probably tried all the solitaire games, but none of them even come close to being as good as this one! It is undoubtedly the best! I love the graphics and player options! Thanks for the great game!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Katniss Everdeen! What can you say about her. She's bold, gutsy, and dynamic. I couldn't wait to read the next predicament she was placed in and see how she got out of it.<br />What a great, riveting, and interest holding book.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie is awesome. Great story line, wonderful acting and the dancing is unbelievable. Made me want to learn to dance like that.Christina should be proud of this one!
B005ETA5K2|1.0|This may be a great product, but I can't tell. The driver failed to load straight out of the gate. The website requires a user ID and password in order to load a driver online. And after allowing them 24 hours--exactly--to answer my email, they have not. This is a customer-hostile company.
B00005CDNK|4.0|I was slightly disappointed in this cd. I felt it was not the same quality that I had come to expect from this group. Dont get me wrong it is still good just not the great sound I was anticipating!!
B007T2XC7A|3.0|It was good, but not one song would make me hit repeat. Nothing catchy. Nothing really memorable. Wouldn't recommend to friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was a really good game and bad a lot of interesting games to play. it does take a long time to gain all those points back up but their r fun games to play that are intriguing
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow. I'm speechless. What a wild emotional ride. I highly recommend a box of tissues with the book!<br />Great story.
B000003C4K|1.0|never liked exodus, vocals have always been terrible sounds like screamy more than singing. if you want real metal listen to slayer, megadeth, metal church, death angel, and metallica.
B00192IV0O|4.0|Well, this CD came with 16 tracks (the 15 that are on the list plus \\"Mare\\") in a choppy Digipack.<br /><br />For some reason, when the CD starts spinning, the CD unit does it so hard I get afraid of breaking the CD apart and damage the optical unit. All my other CDs don't spin so hard on the same units. Strange...<br /><br />Anyway the CD is good, came with MASSIVE hits (I just can't get enough hearing them) and i look forward to buy the next ones.<br /><br />Some people here complained about the songs, because it makes feel like BEP simply ran away from their original style. They did ran away from the way those music were made in the past.<br /><br />Well, i won't make you buy the CD, listen to the samples and buy it if they appeal you.<br /><br />The only reason i'll give 4 stars is the problem of excessive spin on this CD.
0345803493|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read. I hope this author writes more. Im not a reader but when I find a good book I can't put it down
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I LOOOOOOOOVED this Deluxe Edition! It contains 16 tracks of what Britney is about. You really should get the CD if you're a Britney fan or if you liked some of the Singles debuted on it, like Till the World Ends, I Wanna Go, Hold it against Me, and some more.<br /><br />For me, i liked it, worth the money I spent on it. Owning this CD for hardly an year.
B0086700CM|5.0|this came is really fun but hard I love it I think everyone should get it. plus it is a good game for when you have nothing else to do.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I like this CD! Been listening for 5 months. My version has 19 tracks in one CD, incluing massive hits like Part of Me, Firework, California Gurls and more.<br /><br />It reminded me of my Teenage Dream I had when I was younger. Worth a try if you like Katy Perry. As with me, I loved it.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre & was thoroughly impressed! As soon as I saw it I knew I had to \\"own\\" it on Blu Ray. I was genuinely moved by the experience.<br /><br />I have a friend whose son is an active duty Navy Seal. The Hell these men go through just to wear that name is mind boggling. I recently asked my friend what is son was doing & how he is doing. My friend simply replied...\\"I don't know & I am pretty sure I don't want to know.\\"<br /><br />As to the transfer & all the technical details, I am not that meticulous. If it looks & sounds as good in my basement as it did in the theatre, I will be happy.<br /><br />These Men are authentic Seals! Authentic warriors! Authentic heros! Last but certainly not least, I love the quote on the back of the dustcover/slipcover...\\"There's a brotherhood between us. And if you're not ready to give up EVERYTHING (emphasis mine),<br />you've already LOST! This is the definition of true manhood! These are authentic MEN.

B003ASLJO0|5.0|This might be one of the best movies ever made.  I can watch this movie over and over again.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood does a excellent job in this movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|Enjoy the variety and info within this app. I use it daily as part of my morning routine.  Now friends are getting interested.
B005GVA2L0|2.0|I was disappointed with this album. The Open Door was fantastic so I had high hopes for this one, but Evanescence's music just isn't as powerful or as passionate any more. If you really want to listen to it, rent it from a library so you don't waste your money. Or go to youtube...
B0071K5KWU|2.0|I am a huge fan of what T. Banks has done over the years.  But after these 2 orchestral albums, it seems the magic is gone.  I waited until I listened to the album 5 times, before I wrote this.  As I listen, minutes seem to go by, and I don't feel like I heard anything.  Like it was just treading water for huge chunks of every piece.  There are only small snippets in each piece, that are exciting, or memorable.  I can imagine a great album, of TB masterpieces:  Imagine new orchestral arrangements of the 2 instrumentals from Curious Feeling, some from Wicked Lady, the Redwing Suite from Soundtracks..  And of course, Genesis pieces that he composed.  They could be great!  Although the tones Tony used to create were also integral to the depth of his pieces.<br /><br />In 2002, I was very excited about the possibilities of orchestral Tony Banks!  Now I'll admit to myself that the magic is gone.
B004YSGZTE|5.0|The fusion of rock and blues seems to be Bonamassa's specialty and if that's what you're looking for, this CD will not disappoint you.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Saw the movie and knew I just HAD to have the sound track.  GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!  Didn't know Tom Cruise could sing -- Loved Alec Baldwin!  A must see movie, must have CD for sure!!!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|I want to like this album but the sound is muddy and hard to listen to. Another casualty of the loudness wars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game its really cool it tells how animals get lost and u buy more so that u can always kjow how to take care of animals
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My 6 year old has watched every episode at least 5 times. The quality and price is great. I think it would provide him sufficient exposure to Star wars. It would be great in a home theatre setting.
B0086700CM|5.0|when my friend showed it to me it looked hard and not fun but when I played it was so much fun so I think u should get this app. If you like it good but if you don't that is ok :)
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally! Temple Run they finally added this game to the kendle! Iove this game so much! I recomend it for all kids!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This app works great on Kindle Fire. great graphics and a very addictive game with tons of free level to try and master. Love it!
0785152458|1.0|I've been a fan of Mark Millar since he was co-writing AZTEK: THE ULTIMATE MAN over at DC with Grant Morrison. I loved his work on WOLVERINE in the ENEMY OF THE STATE/AGENT OF SHIELD arcs. WANTED is fantastic. I worshipped him on the first two volumes of THE ULTIMATES. I thought CIVIL WAR was one of the best \\"event\\" comics ever. I made time to meet the man in 2008 when he was promoting the never-to-be-finished WAR HEROES. And yes, I adored the first volume of KICK-ASS. I thought the work was brutally funny, totally involving and had terrific art by John Romita Jr. and Millar wrote with purpose and vitality.<br /><br />But, now... I've had it with Mark Millar. Now that he's done with major comic labels, he can finally do everything that he's ever wanted to with the characters he had worked with, but with a seething Garth Ennis-esque disdain. When you look at comics like NEMESIS, SUPERIOR and even KICK-ASS, he's playing with tropes (sometimes very on-the-nose) and distorting them. I don't mind that. With Garth Ennis' work on THE BOYS, he clearly hates superheroes, but he writes his characters with humanity and intelligence. Millar just seems to be going for more and more shock value with little or no respect for the intelligence of his audience or his characters.<br /><br />Here, with KICK-ASS 2, we have our titular character Dave Lizewski working within a network of other costumed do-gooders. It's less about fighting crime, and more about just doing nice things. Hit-Girl, aka Mindy, has been benched from being a little sociopathic assassin by her stepfather Marcus. The other costumed heroes start to band together in their own lame underground lair, calling themselves \\"Justice Forever\\". However, as we could tell in the final pages of the previous volume of KICK-ASS, the villain's son Red Mist was not going to go away, and that he would come back even more powerful. Part of that power comes from the graphic vulgarity of his new alter ego, and the name he's given to his group of dress-up \\"super-villains\\" (neither of which can even be HINTED at here). The other part is the sheer amorality of these \\"super-villains\\".<br /><br />I confronted Millar on Twitter about the events that take place in two of the issues in this collection, which I am about to spoil here so I'll give the standard alert: [SPOILER START] !!!!****In the Red Mist's opening salvo against the \\"super-heroes\\", he decapites a dog, decapitates one of the heroes and puts the dog's head on the hero's neck, then later shows up in Dave's would-be girlfriend Katie's suburban neighborhood, graphically shoot several young children in the head, kill Katie's father and then violently rape her****!!!! [SPOILER END]<br /><br />In that confrontation, I accused Millar for writing for sheer shock value and cheap controversy. He replied with a somewhat-respectful way in which he discussed the idea of \\"escalation\\", that he essentially got from Christopher Nolan's BATMAN films, in which The Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT is a response to Batman himself and how he keeps escalating. He also referenced Alex DeLarge from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (which is a film I don't particularly care for, but can at the very least appreciate) as far as the extreme violence and rape. Neither of these are good arguments, though, because no matter what you say, you can't defend graphic child-murder and you can't defend using rape (which is the lowest-common-denominator of the \\"revenge\\" motive used in male-driven fantasies).<br /><br />The remainder of the book is something that very closely resembles garbage. JR Jr's art gets sloppier by the issue. It seems like it was thrown together at the last minute (much like his artwork of the current AVENGERS VS. X-MEN). The entire kitchen sink is thrown into the mix here as The Artist Formerly Known as Red Mist keeps \\"escalating\\" his vendetta against Dave as if he has something to prove. That's the rub: Red Mist doesn't seem to have a real motive for doing everything that he'sdoing. Sure, his father was killed by Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl, but beyond that, he just seems to be following a script of a bad revenge film. He has no discernible identity. And once the \\"grand finale\\" comes into play as Mindy once again dons the Hit-Girl outfit, and the \\"heroes\\" and \\"villains\\" meet head-on, the series has already lost all of its momentum and it's running on fumes that can't be sustained and it's really just Millar and JR Jr going through the motions.<br /><br />It got even worse lately when the published quote from Millar about his \\"joke\\" idea to do a one-shot when he was at DC called \\"The Rape of Wonder Woman\\", complete with a gatefold ending like in \\"The Death of Superman\\", and it really forced me to look at his past work with more attention to his female characters. Largely, all of his female characters (with maybe the exception of Susan Storm-Richards) are marginalized, hyper-sexualized, villainous, infantile or sociopathic. This includes his Ultimate versions of Jean Grey, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow; The Fox from WANTED,  the cop's daughter impregnated with her gay brother's child in NEMESIS, the super-sexualized Lois Lane-esque reporter of SUPERIOR, and even this book's Hit-Girl. She's not a fully-realized character; she's a robot. She's a male fantasy of what a little girl would be; self-sufficient, lethal and incredibly vulgar. But I am mostly off-topic here. Back to the book.<br /><br />It's not just a poor sequel to a tremendously popular and successful comic; KICK-ASS 2 is just a further example of how Millar is trying to please his audience by blasts of orgiastic violence, shock and vulgarity. Even worse than the character of Red Mist is Dave. Dave in the original volume was instantly relatable, likable, and fun to read about, but this comic gets so mired in the muck of blood and guts and macho posturing that it loses any relatability to any of the characters.<br /><br />The best thing Millar can do at this point is to go back to work writing existing characters, because this stuff... it ain't workin', Mark, although by the reviews here, you couldn't tell. This was almost universally blasted by my brothers and sisters in my local comic shop, and I don't know how it's rated as well as it is here as of this date. I'm hoping that people will start coming around to it, or that Millar himself starts coming around to it, because his two new series, SUPERCROOKS and THE SECRET SERVICE are just more \\"Look at me! I'm playing around with old ideas and making them funny or sickening!\\".<br /><br />One could try and argue that Millar is doing with characters like Batman, Superman, Spider-Man (who is essentially Dave but without the powers), and now a film like OCEAN'S 11 and a character like James Bond is what Alan Moore did with the Charlton Comics characters in WATCHMEN, or the Victorian Era heroes and villains of literature with LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN or even the fairy-tale heroines in LOST GIRLS. That argument is invalid, sadly, because Moore does that work with respect to what's come before and also puts a staggering amount of work into his publications rather than Millar's \\"I'm Selling Screenplays Before I Start Writing Comics!\\" method.doing.

B007N0REX6|4.0|I dearly love Slash's first solo album and with Myles Kennedy a full partner this time my hopes were very high. Appetite for Destruction was one of the best albums ever produced by anyone, ever. GNR couldn't get it done after that and then imploded. The double album wasn't worth a single disk much less 2. But stick with me I have a point to make. The strength of the first Slash album was twofold; choice of vocalist and the proving that Slash can kill on the guitar without a preening idiot on vocals (not calling you out Axle). Myles carries his emotions on his sleeve and he means what he says and boy can he play that guitar. I love Slash, but without Izzy he was greatly diminished. While this isn't truly the second album with Myles, it feels that way. They understand each other and it comes through in every track. \\"Starlight\\" was my favorite track on the previous disk and this time it is \\"Anastasia\\". That song kills. Myles vocals never hinders the often soulful playing of Slash and often adds to it. My opinion is meaningless if you aren't reading this review SO BUY THE ALBUM ALREADY. My only complaint is no lyrics in the cd. I love Alter bridge by the way and Mark Tremonti has a solo album coming out. Just saying.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game I ever played. I luv the way it u have to jump or slide under things. even my mothers boyfriend luvs this game. we had a 30 minute talk about it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was an amazing read.  After seeing the other reviews, I knew I was in for a treat and I was not let down!  Though tragic at times, I believed the characters and their fears.  I understood where Lake was coming from and how Will was being pulled in separate directions.  And how love and family conquer all.  I cannot wait for more from this author!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so boss that I want to poop in scrappys mouth! I hope all you nerds out there try this!!!!! :)
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I was expecting \\"Taken\\" with wolves just like everyone else.  This movie is not that.  A fair comparison might be a WW2 movie expecting \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and getting \\"Schindler's List.\\"  Just because you expect one thing and get another, doesn't change the value of the movie's worth, just the reliability of movie trailers.  Don't be so negative.<br /><br />This movie is good.  Primordially good.  If you listen to it and watch it, it grants you a glimpse of how to face Oblivion.  Liam Neeson's performance is masterful; and the character written for him to portray is complex and full of life.  The entire movie is him \\"not going gentle into that good night.\\"  The ending is stellar and resonates hope.<br /><br />Possible SPOILDER ALERT<br />There is a lot of controversy about the abruptness of the ending.  At first, I was like wtf much like everyone else.  There IS a sequence after the credits roll.  And then I understood the reasoning behind the filmmakers.  This movie in my opinion is about two aspects of facing death, that is, quitting and going home early versus standing your ground, not giving up.  One day, guaranteed, it may look like the credits of YOUR life are going to start to roll...and you may just give up and think that it HAS to be the end.  Yet, if you stand your ground and simply wait, there will be more.  It's not over until someone turns on the lights. I've never seen a director use the ending credits as a metaphor.  Bravo.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is pretty good it keeps me entertained and I enjoy killing zombies all the time. I would be pleased if everyone played this game even if its just to try it cause its easy and simple to play but very entertaining.
0736092269|5.0|There are so many people who could benefit from looking at this book, even medical students and artists.  The drawings are astronomical and VERY DETAILED.  I learned so much about how the musculoskeletal system operates, and how the creator designed our unique bodies.  It will absolutely blow you away when you see how each muscle stabilizes and/or turns a particular bone/bones, and how each exercise and the variation of each exercise strengthens THAT muscle.  The entire design our our shoulder joint(scapula, humerus, clavicle, etc.), with all of the muscles attached to the other bones is just mind boggling, and really took me aback.  I mean, you learn the basics in school, but you really don't appreciate the depth of it all, and all the intricacies, until you view the drawings in this book.  This guy is the dictionary definition of erudite.  You will really appreciate the human body, even more, after staring for hours at these drawings. Also, the descriptions of the exercises is spot-on, too.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm glad it isn't just me.  I had heard such good things about the book, but was sorely let down.  The characters are all weak and unlikable and it reads as if a teenager wrote it.  Bad, bad, bad!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy the app. I love to play it in my spare time. the only reason it didn't get 4 stars was because the tips were really bad gd cluck on it and it would have u move 1 card then you would click on it again and it would tell u to move the piece back that was the only thing that I found frusterating but besides that I love this app.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the Shawshank Redemetion is a real feel good movie but you won't know how good until you reach the end. Freeman (Red)is a lifer and a survivor who knows the ropes. Andy (Robbins) is a quiet shy banker who was wrongly convicted of murder. Andy,in his quiet way learns how to control and take advantage of situations within the prison along with the friendship he develops with Red. The acting is superb and it keeps you on your toes until the surprise and wonderful ending. Don't miss a minute of it. If you need a bathroom break be sure to pause it.
B007EVQAFC|3.0|This is just another best of tour Alice did for past few years. He just changes the name of the tour and adds different theatrics and songs.<br />I think the last album tour he did was Brutal Planet. The only new song from \\"Welcome 2 My Nightmare\\" is \\"I'll Bite Your Face Off\\".<br />He says he doesn't want to be a revival band. Well that's what he's been doing for the past 12 years. Just w/ a younger band.<br />The concert sounded good to me but then again I just have a basic stereo.<br />What I didn't like was the packaging. The CD booklet didn't include any liner notes, pictures or credit. I wouldn't have know Arthur Brown appeared if I didn't read about it earlier on line.<br />No info of who played in the band but again I know from research on line. It looked like it was thrown together quickly.<br />It would of been nice to have a DVD. Since it was on TV in the UK it was already recorded. They could of added a DVD w/ the package.<br />The concert was good and having Arthur Brown sing lead on \\"Fire\\" was strange. I know it's his song but least Alice could of sang some verses.<br />It was just a quick buck by the label and they got mine.
0439813786|5.0|I had seen the movie, but would have liked to have seen even more inside the book before purchasing it.  A friend had told me that the author was more of an illustrator than writer, but so am I. The book was exactly what I expected in fine shape and delivered promptly.  It was just fun in the evening to sit down and look at it, and it will be passed on to grand children in the future.
0345803485|1.0|Really, is this the kind of top-selling garbage people are reading ... and enjoying?? Seems to be merely some idiot's incredibly childish fantasies written specifically for (and to stimulate) the over 45 cougar/spinster sexual imagination (or therein, lack of). Ladies, if you are truly bored enough with life, then by all means ... sit well-back into your leather recliners, open a bottle of your favorite cheap wine and make sure your 'Trojan Twisters' are fully charged. What's really a laugh is that ... these are probably those same \\"ladies\\" who think that video-pornography is tasteless. Right!

B00338QENI|4.0|I purchased this book at Amazon. It was a required book for a women's book club to which I belong. It was a totally fascinating book on many levels.I learned a great deal about the ethical problems related to scientific research, legal problems involved and the effects on the family involved on medical practices emanating from this research.  The structure of the presentation by the author was somewhat unusual in that she \\"shifted gears \\" in her writing in a slightly hodgepodge fashion.  However, the book was captivating to read and it was a good book for book club discussion!
B003HARV3Y|4.0|This is a good, enjoyable, entertaining movie. Sure it skipped some parts, changed things from the book, but if you want to be entertained and like the topic of Rick Riordan's books, then you will enjoy this movie. It is one of only a few movies that my son and I continue to watch every now and then, since we bought it about a year and a half ago.<br /><br />I read all Percy Jackson books and I like them, but I definitely like the movie too. When I first watched the movie, I thought man, they skipped/changed some things but I've got to tell you - you get past that and just enjoy the ride.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Whoever discovers the Easter Egg hidden within OASIS - a global MMOG - wins the entire sizable fortune of the founder of the OASIS and control over the whole thing.  The hero of this book is attempting to find the egg before the evil corporation who will do the unthinkable - charge for access to the OASIS and pepper it with ads.<br /><br />If you didn't understand the first sentence, don't bother reading this book.  While the author does a decent job of explaining most of his geek-culture references, the book won't entertain you unless you already understand most of them.<br /><br />As for content, it's a fun little adventure.  Decently written and copy-edited, but there's nothing especially amazing about it.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer who said that anyone who was a child in the '80s should read it.  I was born in the late 1970s - making me a child in the '80s and a teenager in the '90s.  Throughout the book, I kept thinking it would've been so much cooler (to me) if the book used more '90s references.  My point is this:  If you're one of those '80s nostalgia aficionados, go for it.  If not, don't count on more than a wan smile or two - and a mildly entertaining read.
B00136Q79I|5.0|This album is absolutley fantastic. Every song is like a punch to the face (in a good way) of course! Slayer is just as good as its 'big 4' counterparts and you will not be disappointed with this record. Nothing like hearing Araya let out his AAAAHHHHHAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH, scream.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Powerfull and inventive.  Originally heard one track on NPR, and had to by the CD.  Recommend this high energy alternative brass funk.
B001229W22|5.0|Many consider this record to be heavy metal's finest. It's hard to disagree with this. Every track is solid and really rocks. Lars, Kirk and Cliff really shine on the instrumentals and James Hetfield kills it with his vocals. The lyrics are deep and dark. Do yourself a huge favor and get this record. Rock on metal heads!
B00785P2QC|4.0|having a great time learning this game.<br />love the goals and the challenges watching levels of businesses and vehicles as well as environmental levels.
B007R68DOA|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this album. Ozzy does his usual excellent job vocally and the guitar riffs are out of this world. Just listen to any song and you will be blown away by the guitar work here, it simply just doesn't get any better. So just do yourself a favor and enjoy the pure heavy metal bliss, keep rocking metal heads!!

B001MSMULG|5.0|This book is the first by Daniel Sliva in his Gabriel Allon series, although I didn't read it until I had read two of his later ones in the series. If you're new to Daniel Silva, it is helpful to read this one first.  I found it captivating, and wish I had ordered the hard copy instead of the Kindle version so I could share it with friends.  If you like international intrigue, you'll enjoy this one.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely! I'd been intending to read it for some time, but finally put it at the top of my list when I received a review copy of Shadow of Night. A Discovery of Witches has all my favorite elements: witches, vampires, libraries and books, history, and some romance and danger. I'll be reading Shadow of Night right away.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OK.  I read the other reviews, at least the ones that panned the books.  I agree with most of what they said, however, I enjoyed reading the story.  Not only that, it was a fun read andwhen I got to the end of book 1, I was very glad I also had the other 2 already on my Kindle.  The story had a little mystery, love (it's true), humor, and of course, sex.  Ana puts up a good fight against her desires and you can see her maturing as the story progresses.  Yes, it's rather juvenile but the arthor is also able to get you to see from the male and female points of view.  You know how the plot is going to twist about half the time and the arthor is still able to entertain.  Read this with tongue firmly in cheek, stop trying to \\"count\\" repetitions, and enjoy a good, mindless, read.  For a first shot, I think the arthor did extremely well.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|very poor.  was hoping it would be better than free version but it kept crashing.  permissions requested are intrusive and make it feel unsafe anyway.

B00705GEO4|5.0|Our country of Sweden is a strange little place, taking pride in who we are but rarely talking about it. Perhaps sports is the only area that isn't modest, but Sabaton just changed that with Carolus Rex, and it quickly ignited a flame of undiscovered patriotism in my heart, as well as an interest in 17th and 18th century history. No small feat for someone who usually listens to death metal and gets his history lessons from the occasional Spielberg miniseries.<br /><br />\\"Carolus Rex\\" refers to King Charles XII (Karl XII), one of several mad and brave kings of war during the time of the Swedish Empire (Stormaktstiden), when our monarch and his Caroleans marched out and claimed several chunks of land around the Baltic sea. The album also makes mention of \\"The Lion From The North\\", being Gustavus Adolphus (Gustav II Adolf), another famous name in the pantheons of the Nords.<br /><br />The epic, overblown power metal sound of Sabaton is absolutely perfect here. Combining galloping drums, traditional Maiden-y heavy metal riffs and somber keyboard notes with church organs, choirs and even some oriental sounds makes this a huge endeavour. I've only heard the Swedish version, and that's not likely to change - hearing Joakim Brod&eacute;n's baritone command the Caroleans into war, lament the state of their life and the fallen King is fantastic. Songs like \\"Lejonet Från Norden (The Lion From The North)\\", \\"En Livstid I Krig (A Lifetime of War)\\", \\"Carolus Rex\\", \\"Konungens Likf&auml;rd (Long Live The King)\\" and \\"Ruina Imperii\\" are perfect for Swedish summertime anno MMXII. They work because they're poetic, grand, fascinating and endlessly catchy.<br /><br />At 45 minutes, it's a brief but joyous journey, and there is no variation to speak of, but Carolus Rex is a winner. And while the English lyrics are probably great, the true grandeur can only be conveyed in the native tongue. Let's hope this leads to more metal albums in Swedish, and brings young metalheads into libraries across the world. \\"Buren hem f&ouml;r hand, åter till Svealand, leve Carolus Rex!\\"orld. \\"Buren hem för hand, åter till Svealand, leve Carolus Rex!\\"

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|Like other reviewers, I love the Jane Eyre novel and agree with them in saying this film does not do the book justice; I expected that when i viewed the film, but was still hoping to get some enjoyment of it, however was sadly disappointed. Also alot of things are different from the real story.<br />I anticipate for someone who does not know the story and descriptive emotions between the characters this movie will be quite confusing since it begins at the middle of the book then jump to Jane being a child and back and forth, without including much of what originally was going on in her life. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are so few and cut short that there isn't very much to see regarding the development of there love, the ending where Jane returns to the blind Mr. Rochester was also the worst, viewers will be left waiting for more but will sadly only see the credits. So disappointing...since i think it had potential to be a very good updated version.

B0074MZSWW|4.0|\\"Hold On\\" is the most rockin' pop single I've heard in years. It starts harmlessly enough, with a thick but simple bluesy guitar, and then it breaks into what you think is the chorus, and you're thinking oh this is a nice, pleasant song, until you get to the next chorus which is technically no different but has a certain intangible intensity that makes you start to feel that clouds are gathering. Then there is that tantalizing half-second delay -- \\"You've got hold on / Yeah, you've got to... wait\\" -- and the song continues to gain momentum until about 2:55, when you've arrived at the climax. You are now officially capital-R Rocking -- \\"Yeah, you've got to... WAIT\\" -- this time with the half-second delay so tantalizing that, when the reward is finally delivered, your stomach about jumps into your ribcage. Then the last 28 seconds are needed as a soft (and Joplinesque) coda to bring you down from the climax so that you can return gently to your normal, unexciting life... and listen to the rest of the album.<br /><br />The rest of the album, though, while better than serviceable, just doesn't quite stand up to \\"Hold On.\\" How could it? It's rare that I would praise a pop single over the rest of an album, but this pop single is of the special, they've-really-got-something-here variety.<br /><br />Speaking of special, it should not be overlooked that the Alabama Shakes feature a black woman fronting a white male band. And they're from freaking Athens, Alabama. Whether or not you think that has any sociological significance, it cannot be denied that that combination is exceedingly rare. (Can you name another group with anything resembling that combination?)<br /><br />A worthless prediction: The Alabama Shakes will not be the next Zeppelin or even the next The Black Keys. They will make good, critically-acclaimed music that may even be called \\"groundbreaking\\" but which will not, in fact, break much popular ground. Rather, they will have a large-ish, passionate following but will pretty much remain in eyes of the American populace an obscure band that was profiled on NPR once. None of this is a knock on the Shakes; I'm just saying that, sadly, they fit the mold of an obscure critical darling, praised for their combination of throwback influences and groundbreaking newness but not actually tapping into the broader American psyche (which, if you haven't noticed, is currently infatuated with the likes of Bieber and Gaga).<br /><br />P.S. - A good measure of a blues-rock band is whether they can cover Zeppelin without making purists (like me) want to throw things. Check out their cover of \\"How Many More Times?\\" -- it not only doesn't make me want to throw things but also puts a slight smile on my face.t will pretty much remain in eyes of the American populace an obscure band that was profiled on NPR once.

0920668372|1.0|First of all, this book is awkward, creepy, and disturbing! This book did start off okay. Then, the \\"psycho\\" mother in this book crawls into her teen son's bedroom to rock her \\"big boy\\". She breaks into her son's house when he's older to rock him... what a weirdo! This would not be a healthy relationship for a mother and a son. I personally find nothing about this book funny or okay. And, when he is rocking his own child, where is his wife in all of this? Why is the wife/ significant other excluded? It just doesn't seem NORMAL. Almost like the mother is omitting her from their little world which makes it even more disturbing. Maybe, this is okay for some people but I honestly feel this book is too weird for my son. The illustrations gave me the creeps too. I understand the message the book is trying to convey of the love between a mother and her son... but I think it was taken a bit far. For instance, if my mother-in-law ever broke into our house to rock my husband in his sleep, I think we'd send her to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and get a restraining order. But, then again, WHO in their right mind would ever do this? Hence, the creepiness. Any child would feel violated and creeped out if their mother was like this.
074322454X|5.0|This is a \\"must\\" read.  I found it captivating.  I now understand the tight relationships that are bonded when training intensely and then fighting together.  Becoming \\"brothers\\" is a a key to military success.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|and rather than appreciate this gift, some people feel the need to nitpick its production or the fact that Geddy's vocal range isn't as robust. Seriously? It's as if some fans are so spoiled and feel offended that they didn't make the album that THEY wanted them to make. Rush has been working their musical asses of for 40+ years and they have managed to stay focused and record what I think is their best overall effort since Counterparts. See you on tour guys!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There's not a lot I can add that hasn't already been said, but having just finished I had to say \\"WOW\\".<br /><br />Characterization, timing, plot development, and tone are absolutely pitch-perfect.  It's a dark read - very dark at times - and takes you right up to that edge, but never over.  It's dystopian without wallowing or being overly self-reflective or preachy.  It's slow and rich starting off but builds to a emotional pitch by the end.  I want more (please).<br /><br />I can't recommend it enough, and now I am off to go read everything else this guy has ever written.  I'm just glad he's continuing to turn out more books in the series!
B007K3JFUQ|2.0|That quote form a Gilbert and Sullivan lyric defines this movie's appearance. Remember that particular pleasure of reading Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent and vastly entertaining stories about a man and his sidekick whose braininess unraveled impossible mysteries that no one else could solve? That man was Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick was Dr. Watson, and neither of the ghosts of those two fascinating and intelligent gentlemen can be found in this lengthy, boring mess of a film that seems to be concerned only with action movie clones so popular today and setting in a period that allows beautiful costumes to hide the lack of story. Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney are responsible for hiding behind famous literary characters to create a script that is likely less than 5 pages long.  Guy Ritchie is the star of this noisy piece.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his longtime trusted associate, Doctor Watson (Jude Law), take on their arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), with the help of Holmes's older brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) and a gypsy named Simza (Noomi Rapace).  Now make a movie-long story out of that and you have the second installment (and hopefully the last) of Sherlock Holmes a la Guy Ritchie.  The endless fighting on the screen is also populated by some fine actors such as Rachel McAdams, Eddie Marsan, and Kelly Reilly. If the viewer is entertained by the countless costume changes by Robert Downey, Jr. and by some fairly silly swashbuckling by all concerned then perhaps the two hours will pass quickly. But in the end there is simply no story or resemblance to the creations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to warrant plagiarism of his books.  Pass.  Grady Harp, June 12
B007UEJEMO|5.0|What an incredible disc. The transfer, detail, and sound are wonderful. I think my cats are moving out for good! This is great, relatively inexpensive way to acquire this ground-breaking film. I had absolutely no interest in \\"2\\" or \\"3\\" --- they were, as the kids say, totally lame! When I first saw this film in a theartre, and when I watched it again on this Blu-ray release, all I could say was \\"I believe...\\"

B007B5EDEG|1.0|fab book BUT very difficult to navigate the layout, this was really badly designed. Its such a pity it did not do justice to the writer and would have been better as the five seperate volumes. I would avoid multiple books in future or get then for my ipad not kindle.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was masterful in its complexity and the welding together of one story from two main characters  - both unreliable narrators - with completely different points of view. I agree with readers who did not like the ending, but not because I found it \\"a cop out\\" or \\"unrealistic.\\"  Rather, I did not like it because I found it logical, believable, and therefore, utterly, utterly creepy. Having read all three of her novels (Sharp Objects is still my favorite), my primary question is, What the heck kind of horrible childhood did Gillian Flynn have? :)
1250000971|5.0|Archer has done it again.  I have read several books and Jeffrey Archer always delivers a good read.  Whether it's a stand-alone or book in a series, Jeffrey Archer keeps the reader's attention.  This book could stand on its own; although it is the second in a series.  It has unusual twists and turns throughout the plot and keeps the reader wondering what will happen next.  I found myself always cheering for Harry and Emma, regardless of whatever plight they were in.<br /><br />As always with his books, I have already looked up the expected date for the next book to be out and all I can say is ... please, Mr. Archer, HURRY!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I finished this book about 6 weeks ago, more or less.  I must note, my family background is dissimilar in every aspect: blue collar, low income, low expectations, many siblings with the usual structure of eldest, middle and youngest \\"caste\\" angst.  However, one of my siblings is a murderer, thrice told.  Horrible, violent and senseless.  This is the history I carried into the reading of the book.<br />Perhaps this why the book worked for me--in a way, my sibling's crime was anticipated and surprised no one.  Yet the emotional alteration of my family group was anything but predictable.  As in this novel, all of us found ways to deny what we knew was true.  Of course, we had seen all the precursors of the event!  But in our day to day, we really knew nothing.  What kind of normalcy lives in a teenage life-especially when no one is watching? We would wish that all families have a loving insight of their own, but I believe that is the exception and not the norm.  And William Landay's characters rang true.<br />Whether or not it was true to the legal system seems secondary; the primary good qualities of this book are derived from the portrayal of family, doubt, recognition, and idiotic, way-too-human solutions. Is the writing of quality?  Yes, indeed. Did I enjoy the courtroom blather?  Mostly.  Did I enjoy the narrator's understanding of the system and the potential for manipulation?  Absolutely.  I live in a small midwestern town not far from Chicago.  Politics rule here, fairness and truth is seldom applicable.<br />The ending of the book was gratifying, and I cannot say it is what I expected to occur.  It stayed with me after I shut off my Kindle, and I have given it much thought.  The book brought so much to the table!  It has an ending that satisfies, that elicits debate, that challenges our concept of middle American morality and sense of family.  It is well written and has an acceptable level of suspense for those who require such content.  The dialogue is spot on.<br />I gave it four stars because there were a couple times I had to turn back the pages and readjust my sense of time.  I thought the psychiatrist was a true piece of work and truly hated her by the time her character was no longer needed for the plot. I didn't find her false or inaccurate; just a person in a position whose own motivation and ego precluded effectiveness.  However, without her, the narrator would not have transformed in the way necessary to the events that followed.<br />In short--Read it. Consider your own family dynamics.  Try to actively listen to those dinner-table conversations.  Turn off the screens.  Be there.  And patiently wait for William Landay's next book.

B000HF0J36|3.0|\\"Sharks in the water! Sharks in the water!\\"<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up.  On the plus side there is a distinct lack of nudity despite there being many scenes where nudity could have been included, which ensures I don't feel guilty when I put in on for my son who's on his shark movie kick.<br /><br />The worst language in the movie is exchanged between the chef & his bird -- and the graphic violence isn't terribly graphic despite being rather violent.<br /><br />A few issues with continuity, but it beats the hell out of listening to kids movies in the background.
B007Q0OUNA|4.0|Like the other reviews have said, this set is small. While it contains two of the new style horses, a spiral staircase and a few decorations, this set is otherwise unremarkable.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />This set contains one instruction manual (full sized) that is about 74 pages long. It is loose in the box (not attached to cardboard), so you will want paperweights. This set contains four bags of LEGO bricks, you only need to open one at a time to construct this set.<br />The minifigures are spread throughout the bags, but there is only five of them and they're easily distinguishable from one another, the time saving is minimal.<br />Bag 1 constructs the horses, Ringwraiths, and the extra rock and bush.<br />Bag 2 constructs half of the lower half of Weathertop (the entrance), bag 3 constructs the other lower half (spiral staircase).<br />Bag 4 constructs the top, and has most of the extras and decorations.<br /><br />BONUS:<br />Included with this set is an orange plastic brick separator!<br /><br />MINIFIGURES:<br />This set includes 5 minifugres, including Frodo, Merry, Aragorn, and two Ringwraiths.<br />Both of the Ringwraiths have new styled swords, new styled capes, and rings. The capes have three holes so that the hood fits on properly and also over the horse.<br />Frodo has a ring, a dagger, and a green cape.<br />Merry has a dagger and a light green cape.<br />Aragorn has a new style sword and a torch.<br /><br />Also included is a rat and two horses.<br />Note about the horse: A special feature of this horse is that it's back half (legs and tail) is able to pivot, along with its head. This allows the horse to rear up on its hind legs. One thing not apparent (and a nice feature) is that the horse WILL balance on a level surface, even with a minifigure riding it.<br /><br />PLAY FEATURES:<br />For all the decorations, this set has a few nice play features. The entire set hinges in the middle, unfortunately there isn't much room inside for anything (exceptmaybe a hobbit).<br />This set has two hidden bolts near the staircase (push to fire), and a trap door on top. Pull the pin and the door opens. Also included are extra weapons ( two old style spears, two daggers).<br />Also included is food; a carrot, an apple, a drumstick. Other items include a fire with a pot, and a backpack / sack.<br /><br />DECORATIONS:<br />This set includes the new \\"stone\\" brick, these ones are tan. Also included in this set are a pair of torches, and four \\"mini\\" minifigure statues. On the extra rock is a dead (tan) bush. Like other sets in this series, the building is rounded through the use of many hinged plates. The base of the tower achieves a rocky look through many angled pieces.<br />Lastly, there are no stickers to this set.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br />While this set does contain many weapons, two new horses, and a few new decorations and some key minifigures to the LOTR series, at an MSRP of $60 for 430 pieces, it is quite pricey even by LEGO standards. Unless you are a collector or there is something in this set you *absolutely* must have, I would recommend spending your money on a different set, or at the very least waiting for this one to go on sale.

B007EC6FIS|4.0|I love Keane's first two albums and Tom Chaplin is among my list of top vocalists.  I never listened to their third album, however.  For this album, I must say on first listen I didn't feel as enthusiastic about it.  It doesn't sound like the first two albums, in my opinion.  Without reading about the lyrics, the sounds had a strange country taste to it, so I thought.  There're also subtle changes to Chaplin's voice from what I remembered.  However, after putting it aside for a couple of days I listened to it while reading the lyrics and it sounded much better.  The lyrics give the album an abstract feel, I could see it can be interpreted many different ways depending on one's mood.  Now, the third listen happened a week after the first, and this time I was convinced that this is a good album, and ready to rate it 4-star.  (I feel the tendency will be for it to get better with time, which is important.)  I don't know if you could call this acquired taste.  But I had a somewhat similar but shorter experience with the first album.  So, there you have it.  Be patient, and it'll reveal itself in time.  Thumbs up, Keane!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie that is true to the original books. Any additional material added goes well with the story, much like Peter Jacksons work with the Lord of the Rings.  I really don't have a clue what is up with the reviews, but just like other recent movies that have been unjustly panned \\"John Carter\\" actually turned out to be a great movie.

B0071WQ7WU|4.0|From the moment I heard \\"Bully\\" on the radio, I knew I wanted to have Shinedown's newest effort. Sound of Madness, their previous CD release, easily is on my list of favorite albums. With Amaryllis comes a different feel than SoM, not as hard but lyrically just as amazing.There is more of a power ballad/anthem feel to a lot of the songs on Amaryllis where SoM had a real power, hard hitting feel throughout the album. Amaryllis' opening track, \\"Adrenaline\\" is a fantastic way to start and I think it will be used for sports highlights and in stadiums. \\"Bully\\" is very catchy and brings a strong message of anti-bullying, of how those who are bullied are not alone and can stand together. I'll just say that \\"Unity\\", \\"I'm Not Alright\\", and \\"Miracle\\" are amazing songs - each different but fit so well on the album.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving Amaryllis 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do not think the last few songs are as strong as the end of SoM. After \\"I'll Follow You\\", the songs just seem to drop off for me but maybe that opinion will change as I continue to listen to the CD on repeat. I'll update the review if it does.<br /><br />Don't look to Amaryllis to be the hard-hitting, in your face rock album that Sound of Madness was from start to finish. Amaryllis has a more polished feel, amazing music and lyrical talent shows throughout and a ending that I think is a little weaker than SoM. This is an amazing CD, though. New and old fans of Shinedown will like this. Get it and show Shinedown your love.

B007L6VR12|4.0|It can probably go on record that Wes Anderson has never made a bad film. Certainly some are better than others and everyone is going to have their favorite(s) that they connect to the most (cough \\"Rushmore\\" cough cough), but his films are always enjoyable. It's hard to believe that \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is Anderson's first live-action film in five years and it may be his most well-rounded and personal film to date.<br /><br />The film begins with a tour of the Bishop house, which is extraordinary. The camera pans from room to room as you're introduced to what seems like a life-sized dollhouse. The score of the film also enters the picture through Suzy's brother, Lionel's (Jake Ryan), battery operated record player. It's like a narrated introduction to the different types of instruments used in a full orchestra including harps, cellos, flutes, piccolos, electric and acoustic guitars, ukuleles, banjos, woodblocks, organs, and pianos among several other instruments. The score practically encompasses your senses and is very eclectic; the type of score that sticks to you like glue.<br /><br />One of the first scenes in the film is the \\"flew the coop\\" scene. Any movie that references \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" in its opening moments should already be on your radar of greatness. Anderson is also able to create these magnificent plays within his films. \\"Rushmore\\" had several and \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" has the Noah's Ark play where Sam meets Suzy for the first time. If schools were ever able to put on plays like this regularly, their audience would only expand over time. They're just so creative.<br /><br />The dancing scene on the beach is perhaps the one that has the most impact. Not only does it provide humor, but it's the first scene that really shows how far Sam and Suzy's relationship has actually escalated. The entire beach scene is just great anyway. It's not often that something of that length can be touching, memorable, and hilarious all at the same time. Only Wes Anderson can pull off something like that.<br /><br />\\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" has all of Wes Anderson's trademarks including eye-catching cinematography, a fantastic score, intelligent humor, and an incredible cast. Many believe that this is Anderson's best work to date. The comedy-drama is certainly a welcome change of pace during a summer filled with blockbuster action and extravagant special effects. Although Bill Murray throws his shoe at Edward Norton and it's one of the best moments in cinema for the entire year. For once, \\"leaving your brain at the door,\\" doesn't really apply here. \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is the type of movie that is charming for the soul and makes your brain happy in the process. All in all, it's just a heartfelt and well-written experience that will appeal to everyone.on can pull off something like that.<br /><br />\\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" has all of Wes Anderson's trademarks including eye-catching cinematography, a fantastic score, intelligent humor, and an incredible cast.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is childlishly written and she uses the same phrases over and over.  In my opinion, it really isn't worth the time, as there are so many other great books to read.  Sure, it covers a taboo topic, but it is unrealistic in nature.
B007PM218K|4.0|I just received the Blu Ray of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and immediately went to see it. And I must say I was a little disappointed. I already had the DVD of the movie and played it also and that has a better image than the Blu Ray, it is not for the first time this happened. The image of the Blu Ray is not constant and moving a little now and then. And I do have a good and not cheap Blu Ray player. And the DVD was a joy to see again. Besides that Amazon says it has subtitles in english, spanish and french and that is also what is mentioned on the box, however to my joy it has a lot more subtitles, even Dutch my own language. I had seen this mentioned on \\"Beaver.com\\" a very reliable source that also mentions if a Blu Ray is Regionfree. I became aware of Beaver through a letter on Amazon where someone said that people better should look at that site because it is very reliable and good, and that is correct. A Blu Ray can be better ofcourse. I also just bought the Blu Ray of \\"Buck Privates\\" from Universal and that image was very good, even better than I had expected for a movie from 1941.<br />The included DVD also had a good image.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels has been an almost religious experience.  The last time a new Rush album grabbed me so hard was when I had to choose between an LP or an 8-track.  Before it came out, I felt a lot of apprehension that the lyrical subject matter would end up being too maudlin or introspective.  Instead most of the songs are hard rockers with intriguing story lines that take you into another world.  Yes, there is some introspection woven within the storyline, especially on the most beautiful track \\"The Garden\\", but it is so well done.<br /><br />Makes me feel 20 years old again. I want to drive around in a yellow Trans Am, windows rolled down, blaring this out of my speakers!

0802473156|5.0|This book is not very long (for the impatient readers) but it definitely gives you enough information and advice so that you can understand the message it's trying to show. I've been recommended this book MANY times before I finally took the advice and actually read it. It's been the best decision I've ever made. Also, I told my husband about the book, giving him the chance to read it and he LOVES it! He likes that it's easy to understand and it gives the perceptive of other couples that the writer has talked to.<br /><br />My husband and I were having some problems. I wasn't feeling quite right about the relationship and I didn't realize what the problem was. Once I read this book, I could point out to my husband what my \\"love language\\" AND dialect was. We are both working as hard as we can on making our marriage better.<br /><br />Its definitely worth paying full price for, but whether you buy it new or used, its worth every penny!
0141381477|5.0|Percy Jackson is not your ordinary kid, and I am not just talking about his name. Percy happens to be the son of one of the Greek gods. His life is about to be put in danger as he is accused of stealing the master lightning bolt of Zeus. His only chance is to go to camp half-blood where other children of the gods train in combat.<br /><br />The story of Percy Jackson is great. A modern story of Greek gods, their children, and the perils they face. It actually started out as a story made up by a man to tell his son. The son had A.D.H.D. To help his son cope with his condition, he told a story of a boy who also had A.D.H.D. but it was because he was extraordinary.<br />The story behind the story is enough to show that this will be a memorable series. Riordan blends humor, adventure, and intrigue. Most of his characters are easy to like and you can take delight as you watch them grow up.<br /><br />If you have already read your kids the Harry Potter books, or you want to introduce them to Greek mythology, this is something you will want to pick up.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album in my mind is top 5 best in their discography. The sound is amazing, vocals are a strong as ever, and each player are at the pinnacle of their craft. It's disappointing to hear so many complain about some songs being too \\"complex\\" or having \\"too many changes and sounds going on at once\\". Last I checked, Rush is still a progressive rock band; The whole point of being labeled \\"progressive\\" means they are not taking the road most traveled and are creating material unique to themselves and the genre. 2112 anyone? Hemispheres? If you want simple time signatures and radio friendly melodies (There is ton of beautiful melody on this album by the way), go listen to alternative/pop non-pioneers like Nickelback. Their is a lot of creativity and effort in this album and it deserves more than one listen. The liner notes also illustrate an pretty intriguing concept/story as well and really add to the overall experience.<br /><br />  Moving on, a great album by a great group of guys. I have to say I'm enjoying this album a lot more than snakes and arrows and really feel that if this were their last album (let's hope it's not) that it would be a great final chapter to their 38 years together. Just listen to the last track, \\"The Garden\\" and it'll leave you feeling more than satisfied.

B006ZJJ70O|4.0|Leopold Stokowski's RCA stereo years may have spanned 1954-1974, but more of the recordings in this box set come from the end of that era than anywhere else. In fact, the majority come from 1973-74, more than any other year(s) by far. The only point in mentioning this is that Stokowski was ninety-one/two at the time, and I don't think the quality of his output at that point was as consistent as it was even a few years earlier. But there are some gems here, and I would recommend this set at the right price. Here are a few observations:  I began my survey with the first disc, which includes the Beethoven &#34;Eroica&#34; Symphony, Coriolan Overture, and the Academic Overture of Brahms, and proceeded to jump around from there. Stokowski was certainly no George Szell; but I was surprised that he didn't make much of the &#34;Eroica.&#34; If there's one word that describes his reading it would be glossy. This is better than calling it glib, but not much. From there I turned to the Brahms Fourth, which also seemed like it would be ideal fodder for the conductor. The first movement is somewhat superficial and it ends in a rush, sounding all wrong to me. Things improve, especially in the fourth movement, but I think the overall pace is just too fast. Both the Beethoven and Brahms symphonies date from 1974.  Next, I turned to a 1960 recording of &#34;The Moldau,&#34; and here I hit pay dirt. While Stokowski's treatment is far from idiomatic - I imagine Ancerl or Kubelik cringing if they heard this record - his conversion of the score into billowing clouds of sound actually works. It's definitive Stokowski - plushly imagistic.  After this I listened to the &#34;Prelude/Liebestod&#34; from &#34;Tristan und Isolde.&#34; This is a balanced performance, with Stokowski avoiding melodrama while capturing the Wagnerian atmosphere perfectly. (There are two discs filled with popular Wagner fare, a specialty of the conductor.) I was surprised to find that the next thing I sampled, Mahler's &#34;Resurrection&#34; symphony (1974), was on the same high level. I'm not aware of any other studio recordings that Stokowski made of Mahler, but he clearly had a real feel for this music and the natural-sound world that it occupies. An excellent performance. I also very much enjoyed Menotti's suite from &#34;Sebastian,&#34; which I had never heard before; and its disc mate, the excerpts from Prokofiev's &#34;Romeo and Juliet,&#34; were also quite good. Both of these comprise the earliest recordings in this set - 1954 - and the sound is exceptional.  Stokowski had a reputation as a gifted interpreter of  Shostakovich, and while I'm not qualified to comment on the recording of the Sixth Symphony (1968) included here, I found myself appreciating it. The Tchaikovsky &#34;Pathetique&#34; (1973), however, sounded off to me - a surprise in that this material seemed right up Stokowski's alley. Another war horse, Dvorak's &#34;New World&#34; Symphony, also from 1973, suffers from an ultra-slow second movement which is a shame because the other movements, especially the third and fourth. are prime Stokowski. Khachaturian's Third Symphony (1968) is an infrequently recorded curiosity that I'd never heard before; and quite frankly, after one listen, I didn't feel like I had been missing much. The 1975 recording of &#34;Scheherazde,&#34; on the other hand, is a classic; and the &#34;Russian Easter&#34; overture (1968) that follows is also very fine. The conductor was famous for his Bach transcriptions, and those who like that sort of thing will undoubtedly get pleasure from them.  The sound picture is surprisingly variable. The recordings from the 1960's have immediate presence and bloom vs. those from the 1970's which sound somewhat distant by comparison. The up-front sonics featured in Enescu's Romanian Rhapsody and the arrangement of Liszt's second Rhapsody, both recorded in 1960, really capture the Stokowski magic whereas you have to turn the volume knob way up for virtually all of the stuff recorded in the 1970's, and even then it can sound thin.  This is a fine source for a massive chunk of Stokowski, and while there are other stereo recordings from earlier in the conductor's career that I wouldn't want to be without ([[ASIN:B00004TIPT Debussy: Nocturnes / Iberia / Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun ~ Stokowski]] and [[ASIN:B0000589T6 Holst: The Planets / Schoenberg: Verklarte Nacht (Transfigured Night) ~ Stokowski]] to name just two), you can hardly go wrong here at less than $2 a disc - the offer price from amazon resellers at the time of this writing.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is entertaining for all ages. Many new levels to unlock an new challenges to undertake. Something different every time you log on.
1250000971|4.0|I just finished this book and was disappointed to see that we have to wait to find out what happens next.  But on the other hand, I'm happy to know there's another book coming!!  I didn't find out about about the Clifton Chronicles until the 2nd one had been published, so there wasn't any waiting time in between books for me.  Now there will be.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these books.  I wasn't able to stop reading them and only wished I had more time in my schedule to do so!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and interesting as well as making time fly. I will recommend this to my friends. this is also a chalange to your brain.
0765316994|2.0|First part of this book was strange but had something going for it? the rest of the book was a ramble of  the author trying to rationalize his existence as a writer. He does not do this well, he needs to make up his mind to write a better book instead of wandering around on the fictional internet/blogs, fuzzys, bips, blips or other electronic devices he needs to populate his time.  I don't even want a sequel to this book, it was a waste of time and money and I would not recommend john Scalzi as a writer or author. He should go into movie script writing since new ideas are difficult for him to come by.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Totally worth the price. The product was immediately shipped and arrived pretty quickly to my home. It looks brand new and I'm excited to watch them all!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|To hell with the naysayers, this album is another incredible offering from the holy triumvirate. Yes, we Rush fans will defend them, but it's not because we can't help ourselves, it's because Rush is worthy of that kind of respect and admiration. There aren't many bands that can carry on for all these years and still infuse so much spark, creativity, and vigor into their new music - almost as if it's a new band just bursting at the seams with vitality. Not to mention a band that gives its audience its money's worth by playing about 3 hours of music at every show. It shouldn't be difficult for anyone to understand why we love them so much.<br /><br />A couple of years ago we were given two new songs - Caravan and BU2B - which my ears got very used to over that period of time. So much so that it was a bit difficult to start wrapping my ears around the new versions on the album (admittedly they're not that different, but enough so that the changes were noticeable). At the time the single versions were released, we had no idea what they were up to but the songs stood up well on their own nevertheless.<br /><br />With the story of Clockwork Angels coming into focus, Caravan and BU2B are the start of the journey for our protagonist. I also like the way some of the tracks on this album run into each other, it's a nice touch that isn't used very often anymore, even in progressive rock. The title track is the longest on the album, but is certainly one of the stronger pieces. If Caravan and BU2B set the stage for the story, Clockwork Angels helps to kick it along nicely with a 6/8 riff.<br /><br />Things really heat up with The Anarchist, a fairly heavy song. Geddy's bass sound on this one reminds me of the sound Chris Squire would tend to get out of his bass in Yes - lots of treble with a lot of punch. Geddy's whisper of the Pedler in the beginning of the song (\\"What do you lack?\\") is eerily haunting as well. I like the way this song is told from the point of view of the anarchist character himself, as it contrasts well with the bulk of the lyrics which are told from the protagonist's point of view. Carnies is another nice heavy number, which leads up to the mid-album Halo Effect, a nice shorter piece that serves as a bridge between the longer pieces on either half of the album.<br /><br />Seven Cities of Gold is one of my favorites, the first new song I'd listened to since Headlong Flight, as it so happens. The Wreckers is a little more accessible sounding, and the strings add a nice touch toward the end especially. Headlong Flight itself showcases the band's talent and virtuosity quite well. I remember some criticism over the lyrics to this one when it came out as a single in April, to the effect that it wasn't up to Peart's standards. But when you take this in the context of the story, it fits quite well. It's a little more direct than some of the other lyrics, but that matters little - this song is fast, heavy, and gets the blood pumping. Try listening to this one on your way to work in the morning, I can almost guarantee you will not need any caffeine (just remember to watch your speed, many Rush songs tend to make me drive faster :-))<br /><br />BU2B2 is more of an interlude than a song, as it is only about a minute and a half, but the spare sounding strings are excellent and offer a nice musical contrast to some of the other material. Wish them Well has a great melody and proves that Geddy has quite a vocal range. I wasn't sure how well The Garden worked as a Rush song on first inspection, but believe me, this is pure Rush -  progressive, meloncholy, and yet uplifting - a track that elicits true feelings of kinesthesia, particularly in the chorus. It's not as heavy as some of the other songs, but it caps off the album nicely, both lyrically and musically.<br /><br />To my fellow Rush fans, here's to yet another fine album from the boys. Naturally we're looking ahead to the upcoming tour later this year. Here's also hoping the next album is a little sooner than five years :-)

B0086700CM|5.0|VERY addictive. tests your hand eye coordination as well. cool powerups to unlock and different charcaters to unlock too. great time passer.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|As a fan of 34 years, I have always enjoyed every new Rush release, but have not felt the releases of the past 25-30 years have been at the level of their \\"peak period\\" (\\"2112\\" through \\"Moving Pictures\\") - with that said, I have always felt that eventually Rush could make another utterly defining yet forward looking and starkly amazing album as their best work. For that 25 years or more, I imagined what it might be like many times. It might hint at specifics of their greatest works, but never sink to aping them - and this would only be because they would finally stop running from their past successes and embrace who they are - they would just \\"be\\" Rush. So, at the same time, a single glance backwards would allow several steps forward. I also have always preferred Neil Peart's lyrics when he weaves them through a more literary setting - when telling a tale, as opposed to making direct commentary on verious states of human affairs. When it is underpinned within a tale it just feels so much more interesting. And they would open it up and really cut loose with the playing, stretch the songs a bit. Not wanking just to show off, but rather playing aggressively more frequently to elevate the song even more.<br /><br />Well, guess what? \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is that album. It fills in all the pieces of the puzzle that shaped what I could only vaguely imagine, but always felt like it could happen.<br /><br />There are always great driving songs on a Rush album, whether it's \\"Far Cry,\\" \\"One Little Victory\\" or \\"Driven.\\" On \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" there are so many - \\"Caravan,\\" \\"Headlong Flight,\\" \\"BU2B,\\" \\"The Anarchist,\\" \\"Seven Cities of Gold,\\" \\"Carnies.\\" There are NO weak songs here. And the individual songs are NEVER weighed down by the concept. Strip any one song and it stands on it's own. Like the songwriting of the Keyboard-era in the late 80's? - \\"The Wreckers.\\" You want a huge proggy concept piece? - the title track, \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" You want a Down and dirty gut-wrenching track? - \\"Carnies.\\" An utterly beautiful and poignant song? - \\"The Garden.\\" Celebratory? - \\"Wish Them Well.\\" Musically and sonically aggressive? (almost the whole album), but especially \\"Headlong Flight,\\" and \\"Caravan.\\"<br /><br />Collectively and individually, even more than they ALWAYS do, Rush have hit a high point all at once: Geddy Lee has one of his best vocal performances - he's not shrieking but he's certainly moved into the higher range of his vocals quite a bit more often than on many recent releases. This time he's sitting in a sweet spot that is less likely to sound shrill to the more casual, less appreciative listener, but still a welcome relief to old school fans who yearn for the classic \\"Syrinx.\\" Likewise, Alex Lifeson turns in plenty of soloing. Carefully measured not to run on for too long, yet still completely in the moment. Highlights: The aggression in the \\"Headlong Flight\\" solo and the split second at the end that evokes only an ever so brief hint of \\"Working Man\\" in the final split second. The beautiful lyricism of both the \\"Clockwork Angels\\" solo and the solo from \\"The Garden.\\" There are many more excellent solo moments as well. My pick for top solo: \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" It IS genius. And OF COURSE, Neil Peart's drumming. The ever-rehearsed drum master, always up for a new challenge, took a new approach that allowed him to play more freely and create his parts very much in the moment for this album. It affects the albums feel in a fantastic and amazing way. And the playing is as dexterous and complex as any of his storied career. It is both cohesive and urgent. As a Bass Player, this is easily one of Geddy Lee's most impressive and aggressive works - his lines weave in and out of the song melodically in all of their fleet-fingered glory, through the most aggressive of tones, both huge and grinding, and totally in-your-face. Lifeson's Rhythm guitar work is far less layered and far more direct and focused on the main part at hand - which really highlights his inummerable strengths as one of the most brilliant and completely underrated guitarists of our time. And there are more RIFFS. Enough said on that matter. Neil's lyrics are brilliant - it brings together the literary, the topical, tells a story and each chapter stands on it's own.<br /><br />This album is everything Rush - everything they ever were, everything they are and everything they ever will be. Every man stands out and they all stand out. How they are able to sound collectively brilliant and individually brilliant at the same time is something they are so amazingly good at it, it boggles the mind. Yet it's so sweet to behold. Ever so sweet.<br /><br />Final Note: Kudos to producer Nick Raskulinecz for helping to facilitate this brilliance that was brewing close to the surface, waiting to explode into this fantastic new album. To Rush fans, the role he's played since first producing the band on \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is well known and well documented. I sensed the greater possibility for this moment with every new piece of information that surfaced between these two albums. His contribution is immeasurable. Also, thanks to Nick and to Richard Chycki for helping to once again achieve a sonically amazing album.<br /><br />\\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a masterpiece.
B0086700CM|5.0|i absolutely love temple run it is so addicting it seems like the last couple nights ive been up playin it
0375869026|5.0|I have never written a review before, despite having being an avid reader.  But, due to how great this was I felt compelled. I am a school librarian and ordered this for the library on a tip from another librarian. I am spending my summer reading all the new books I ordered, this being the first one. I am scared to read the others because I don't think anything will compare. This book delivers such a beautiful message about kindness and empathy, but not in a heavy handed way. I will recommend this book as much possible!!!!!! Bravo.
B005HSL626|1.0|It wouldn't show up on my kindle fire. I guess it froze. I'm not really sure what happened but it only showed this loading screen..
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|easy to use when you are on the go and no access to a computer.  great for quick review or short edits.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This great movie was written and directed by Woody Allen. Gil (played by Owen Wilson) is a young writer visiting Paris with his fiancé. While she follows her own interests, Gil goes to a party alone. There he meets a group of long-dead writers (think Hemingway, Cole Porter, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald). But who can he tell?<br /><br />The best part of the movie is that Owen Wilson plays Woody Allen playing Gil. (Double the humor) I'll watch this one more than once.
B007G51UV0|3.0|Everything about this motherboard is solid, except the gigabit Ethernet port. I have FIOS with 25 Mbit up and 25 Mbit down. I hooked it up with wire and got the 25 Mbit down, but up was less than 1 Mbit. I originally thought it was the router, but tested it on wire on my laptop and got 25/25. I then bought an Intel ethernet cart, but had the same result, 25/1. I am fine with the wireless sub-system, 25/25, but can't figure out why the wire does not work correctly.<br />I don't want to take the build apart to send it back, but very disappointed with this MB.
B005OKTPKC|2.0|This book started off with a chance but limped its way on to a total lack of interest. The plot was transparent and the outcomes too pointless for words. There was no conflict, no heart to the story.<br />I enjoyed many of his other books and would blindly buy anything he put out. Not anymore.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|lots of different puzzles. makes you think. I would recommend. the game. I like that its not just one kind of puzzles

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a poorly written, very predictable sham of a book.  I don't get the hype.  It is not worth the time or money and the publisher will not allow you to loan it out on kindle.  There are so many great reads and empowering books out there and this series is not one of them.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy this game.  Lots of levels to expand to...good graphics.  Just keep building your little frontier village.  wish it was easier to hook up with others playing the game and friend them to get thodse extra pats going...<br />_

0307592731|5.0|Wild is not just a memoir about a hiking trip. It is not a backpacking book. It is an open, painfully honest account of a woman's journey through grief, loss and transition. It has far more in common with the work of Joseph Campbell than Colin Fletcher.<br /><br />Strayed is what I call \\"a writer's writer.\\"  Although the book is accessible to just about anyone, the strength of her prose and ability to double back, foreshadow, and revist episodes of her life demonstrate a skill I have not found in many contemporary authors.<br /><br />The book is memoir, not autobiography, so it has creative latitude that Strayed uses to full advantage while she demonstrates her own passion for language and story telling.<br /><br />I wish I could be so honest in my own writing.  I have not experienced the same events Strayed has experienced. But I definitely feel like I've shared them.
015670160X|5.0|Orlando is perhaps the most entertaining of Woolf's works that I have seen. Clearly, she wanted to explore gender components but chose a wonderfully satirical framework and let go of ordinary boundaries of time and space to create the utter freedom she needed to do so. I'm sure there are many more well thought out discussions of the gender-identity issues in these reviews, but I wanted to let readers know what wonderful satire and what beautiful writing this is and its all wrapped around a literary romp that provides sheer pleasure for fans of English literature.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Great movie- musical. Sound quality great ! Picture quality great! Loved the movie itself! Arrived undamaged. Would recommend! Best quality overall!
B002X6DQV4|5.0|I purchased 3 of these and they work great because you don't have to connect to the battery separate.  You just click and connect and you can go from charging the battery to using the battery.  I would recommend for anyone using a deep cycle or AGM battery.  I use mine in a solar backup system and this is so nice and if I need to switch to a CTEK Charger I can do it easily.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Best tv series ever!! I just finished season 3 and ordered season 4!! Keeps you coming back for more and really involved with characters.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game but it deserves a 4 because it keeps on lagging I could get to over 5,000,000 on iphone or opacity but on kindle I could go to at least 800,000
0345803493|2.0|I read with great anticipation Fifty Shades of Grey, and was very disappointed.  From the book reviews, I thought this book would provide a look into the world of S&M, but sadly it is simply a romance novel with references only.  Perhaps book two and three are a bit deeper.  Recommended for lovers of romance novels.
1439127700|5.0|In this season of vicious partisan politics, it's a fresh breath to read a book about the most exclusive fraternity in the world: The U.S. Presidents Club.<br /><br />This book is full of fantastic stories and anecdotes about what it's like to be part of the brotherhood of United States Presidents. Beginning with Hoover and all the way to Obama, these authors provide ample examples of how these men will stand by one another even when they don't always agree.<br /><br />It's wonderful to read stories of how the leaders of each political party can rise above the vindictiveness of campaigning and realize they need one another.<br /><br />While there are examples of how these Presidents have strained the relationship at times, most of the stories revolve around unity. It's the civility that we should take note of whenever we're dealing with differing policies.<br /><br />You'll read how the new Presidents reached out to the former Presidents when they realized the job was much harder than they realized. You'll read how President Carter has done more as an ex-President than he ever did while in office. (sometimes not such a good thing for the other Presidents) You'll see how, despite what the talking heads may say during transitions, the Presidents have always wanted to make things as smooth as possible for \\"the next guy\\".<br /><br />Perfect example is when President Obama sat with the former Presidents and President Bush said, \\"We want you to succeed.\\"<br /><br />Full of stories and two sections of photographs. This book is a nice, positive political book that we need now more than ever.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun. I wuld say not to hesitate at all on purchasing it. Its a free app n its one of the best games out there. So now thy uve read my review go download this app!!!!!:)
B00881VLCE|5.0|lots of free and pay puzzles. easy to use interface. difficulty settings work great. I would buy it again. don't know what else to say but if you like puzzles this is a great app.
1567184855|4.0|I haven't read a lot of these books... But I really liked this one.....  I have had my own religious experience, returning to the universe we live in, you know, the larger universe that is.....  I don't quite remember most of my journey, who would have thought. It all happened so fast......  I like Michael Newton's book though, but I am hoping that Heaven isn't so boring.  I once thought that in Heaven we would not have bodies. That seemed like it would be a boring existence...  But I am guessing that there will not be a problem with nothing interesting to do in Heaven...  Truth is we may not have a bodies here on Earth, any more or less than we would in Heaven.......  We may just think we have a body here on Earth anyway, as Earth can be looked at as a sub-section of the larger universe, and that there is nothing particularly unique about our current situation........ We &#34;could be&#34; just a little prejudice about this wonderful little universe here on Earth that we have grown so fond of.
B004UID2LC|1.0|please do not download this so called app.  it is really awful and I reget it.  I hope it doesn't mess up my kindle.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|after reading books 1&2 so quickly, i found book 3 slow and difficult to finish. nowhere near as exciting as the first 2 and overall a disappointment.

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I just saw the movie...and I loved it loved it loved it! I bought the album in mp3 since that's where all my music is. What a sexy beast Tom Cruise is! And wow! He can sing! He didn't know he could sing! I agree that Julianne Hough is cute, but weak in a starring role. The other revelation is Diego Boneta! Where'd he come from? Cute and can sing!! Buy the CD or mp3, and go see the movie!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I never thought I could become so thoroughly absorbed in a video game.  Playing this is such fun, finding ways to climb to each successive level. My (grown) kids tease me to stop playing games, telling me what I told them when they were much younger, \\"Stop playing games and do your work!\\"<br /><br />The premise of the game is simple.  There are some adorable birds who try to get rid of the bad pigs.  They slingshot themselves at the pigs and the obstructions surrounding them.  The player must figure out how to form each slingshot throw, eradicating the porcine enemies.  The backgrounds are simple, the sound effects are cute, and the colors and interactivity make the game all the more interesting.<br /><br />Gosh, maybe I should try and put this game on my phone, too!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting. a long time. for this game to come to the aneroid market. I am delighted!  it is a little harder to play on the kindle fire becausebits bigger but overall I loved it

B005LAIHRC|5.0|MOVIE REVIEW #38: \\" Rock of Ages \\"<br /><br />The first thing I want to say is that this film is about the Music of the 80's! - Having been a young `whipper-snapper' at the time - what surprised me most about this film - was that it was FUNNY!. Laugh out loud funny. That alone, seems to take the entire audience I was with by surprise. So-much-so, that they applauded and laughed throughout the film out loud. Like me!<br /><br />Hearing these songs done by Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible, Top Gun) singing Bon Jovi's classic \\"Wanted Dead or Alive,\\" (YES TOM SINGS AND VERY WELL TOO!) to Def Leppard's hit \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me,\\" and Guns `N Roses anthem \\"Paradise City.\\" Along with Cruise then doing duets with Malin Akerman (The Proposal, Watchmen) on Foreigner's power ballad, \\"I Want To Know What Love Is,\\" and shares the mic with Julianne Hough (Footloose-2011, Burlesque) on The Scorpions' \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane.\\" ...was a cinematic shock to me. As well as a hysterically performed, yet really heartfelt delivery, duet of my fav REO Speedwagon song  \\"I Can't Fight This Feeling\\" between charismatic Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Beetlejuice) and  an off-the-wall Russell Brand (Arthur, Get Him To The Greek). (SPOILER: Yes, the song title tells it all!)<br /><br />Based on the Broadway play - which premiered at the King King club in Hollywood, CA in 2005 transferred to the Vanguard theatre in Los Angeles, CA and finally went to the Broadway stage in 2009 - It was written by Justin Theroux (Iron Man 2, Tropic Thunder), Chris DArienzo (Hot, Barry Monday) and Allan Loeb (21, Just Go With It)  it tells the story of small town girl from Ohio,  Sherrie - played electrically and brilliantly by Julianne Hough and the L.A. city boy Drew, again played brilliantly by Diego Bonita (Mean Girls 2, 90210) who meet on the Sunset Strip while pursuing their Hollywood dreams. Their rock 'n' roll romance is told through other heart-pounding hits of Def Leppard, Joan Jett, Journey,  Night Ranger, Pat Benatar, Steve Perry, Twisted Sister, Poison and Whitesnake .<br /><br />Director Adam Shankman (Hairspray, Bedtime Stories) did his best to make you tap your feet, sing along and - again - make you laugh out loud. He threaded the simple story using the dynamics of the performances and the clever `mashed' songs of the 80's. He definatle got the looks and hair styles of the time and even slams the popular `boy bands' of the time. Hysterically! From scene #1 - It's got dance, choreography and bright colors...even an adjusted LA Skyline for the times!<br /><br />Tom Cruise, as Stacee Jaxx, gives another amazingly eclectic, strange, exotic (and sometime erotically suggestive) and funny performance. And I never knew he could sing. Amazing voice - yes it is him - and great musical `chops' to carry the film. Bravo Tom!<br /><br />Another stand-out performance was Cathrine Zeta-Jone (Chicago, The Terminal) as the religious wife of the Mayor of Los Angeles on vengeful (and personal) vendetta again Tom Cruise character the rock star himself, Stacee Jaxx! She is spicy, passionate with dance and funny and boy she can sing her version of Pat Benatar's most popular hit \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\". Bravisimo Cathrine!<br /><br />Also some other standout performances came from Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Saving Private Ryan) as the crummy musical agent, singer-songwriter Mary J Blige (Entourage, Ghost Whisperer) as the club manager who takes Sherrie under her wing and Malin Ackerman (The Hearbreak Kid, Catch .44) as the confused Rolling Stone Magazine Reporter. Included are hidden cameos of REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin and Debbie Gibson themselves!<br /><br />My only concern is that if you were not familiar with these great songs of the 80's...will the newer generations of audiences get it? I hope so. I'm sure they will get the humor, but like me, will they be singing along out loud with the rest of the crowd - like first screenings audience I saw it with who remembers the time - way back when `Music Had Messages'?  (Kinda' of like my experience at the theatre with the film version of Mamma Mia...you couldn't help but sing along - out loud to the hits of ABBA!) This was a fun and - most importantly - funnier than I ever expected! Another good fun family (PG-13 for provocativeness)  film that tells its entire simple story - through its music! GO see it!ay back when `Music Had Messages'?  (Kinda' of like my experience at the theatre with the film version of Mamma Mia...you couldn't help but sing along - out loud to the hits of ABBA!)

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is wicked addicting and fun! the path changes with every run. i would definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game very much. It's. a fun game to play and reminds me a lot of the Mario games I played when I was younger. I would recommend. this game to any adult who wants to enjoy a very entertaining play.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a fun game and great waster of time, but I had to knock it down for how bad it lags on Kindle Fire. plays just fine for a while but then starts having annoying pauses and slow reactions to touch input to the point I have to quit playing. its not me, I get runs 4 or 5 times longer on idevices.<br /><br />UPDATE: later game patches seemed to mostly fix the lag issue on the Fire.  My son now has my Fire as I've upgraded to a Fire HD 8.9, and the current version of the game runs well on both.
0061692042|2.0|The opening hooks you and then a lot of thinking about past,present and future possibilities. The plot just withers away.
1612130283|3.0|I really wanted to enjoy this. I had just finished reading a remarkable novel and thought \\"Hey! Let me see what's on the bestseller list on Amazon!\\" So I came across this erotica.. and i honestly did start reading the novel thinking \\"okay.. so it seems like it will be good!\\" But after fifty pages or so.. the REPETITION......the overuse of \\"blushes, gasps, oh crap, moans, gasps, gapes\\" and so many other words oh my goodness! It's really hard to imagine the scenes with such cheesy choice of diction and seeing it over and over again... but I mean we have to consider the characters also... ah yes... Christian Grey the 27 year old multi-billionaire with so much free time... right right... likely, right? And then Anastasia Steele.. okay she's a realistic character, pale skin, brown hair, English major, virgin... But COME ON... I'm 18 and while reading it I felt like the author was writing from a 17 year old teenager's mental fantasies.. it just.. I mean as a teenager myself I felt like there should have been an editor to give the author a wake-up call for the repetition and maybe more connectable characters. I read the author's biography, and I understand its her first book, and kudos to her! But I just don't understand the big hype is all!  I had to take off 2 stars for my reasons stated and overall it IS addicting, it's one of those books that's pretty much brain candy and you just keep yearning page after page for more action haha
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not a bad app. Keeps me entertained a while. I would be more likely to give 5 stars if the pop-up ads weren't so frequent.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. I have it on my phone and now I use it on my Kindle Fire. I have access to several different translations, and reading plans to help me learn the Word of God. This is an awesome tool. And its Free! You can't go wrong with this app. If you don't have it Get It Now! You will enjoy...be blessed!
B007MDQW3W|4.0|You ever have an eccentric friend who you really enjoy being around, but sometimes you wish they would just be more normal? Well, Regina Spektor is like that for me. While I have always appreciated her quirkiness, she can come across silly, pretentious and downright annoying at times. Like Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Sophie B. Hawkins, Fiona Apple, Imogen Heap, Ida Maria, and others I know I have failed to mention, at certain times they overdo it, or miss the mark completely.<br /><br />\\"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\\" isn't as great as 2009's \\"Far\\" or 2006's \\"Begin To Hope\\", so it comes as a slight disappointment. I don't know what it is exactly. I think my favorite tracks is \\"All The Rowboats\\" because it has so much going on and is sonically the most interesting track here. Her remodeled version of \\"Don't Leave Me\\" is equally as catchy and interesting. Beyond this, you have to dig deeper into the melodies and lyrics to find treasures like \\"Oh Marcello\\", \\"Ballad Of A Politician\\", \\"Patron Saint\\" and \\"Small Town Moon\\". \\"Firewood\\" and \\"Open\\" are also worthy.<br /><br />But, after repeatedly listening to \\"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\\" it feels kind of dull as a whole. It's like that old Spektor spark is dimly lit here. Now perhaps one could argue this is a more mature work, and that's why the energy is turned down.<br /><br />There are three bonus tracks that, for me, did nothing to enhance the album, and I say you are better off without them tacked onto the end. Every artist is entitled to a digression rather than progression in their career. I don't fault Spektor too much here since I am giving it four stars. I mean her quirkiness and piano playing continue to show she is a true artist. I would never argue that Spektor isn't talented, but sometimes, as I said above, you wish an artist would just drop the oddness and give you something more straightforward.<br /><br />Here's how \\"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\\" compares to Spektor's other works:<br /><br />2001 11:11: Three Stars<br />2002 Songs: Two and a Half Stars<br />2004 Soviet Kitsch: Three Stars<br />2006 Being To Hope: Five Stars<br />2009 Far: Five Stars<br />2012 What We Saw From The Cheap Seats: Four Stars1: Three Stars<br />2002 Songs: Two and a Half Stars<br />2004 Soviet Kitsch: Three Stars<br />2006 Being To Hope: Five Stars<br />2009 Far: Five Stars<br />2012 What We Saw From The Cheap Seats: Four Stars

I don't see how people think it was poorly written. I think she's a great (detailed) story writer and I'm SO happy my coworkers told me to get this book. Its all we talk about! If you love romance you MUST read this story :) A+++ from me!
B002S0OBN2|3.0|I have had this album since it first came out and I have listened to it a few times.  I always thought it was missing something. The voices were superb, the quality was good, but the ordering of the songs and the pacing just seemed to be a jumbled mess.<br /><br />I heard that the Melbourne production was going to play in the theatres here in America and I had to see it for myself. To my surprise the show that was put on in Australia was radically different from the CD in many ways!! The prologue is gone, some songs are gone or mixed with others, the plot is subtley different, and the pacing is now crisp. I also loved that they added many of the melodies from the original show to add a link to the past. The director in Melbourne took Lord Andrew's musical and turned it into a must see!!<br /><br />I now own the blu-ray of Love Never Dies and I must say that I like it almost as well as the original Phantom. If you want to listen to this music, get the video, or wait for a soundtrack release from the true production.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I would give this album 10 stars if I could! One of the most ground breaking album to come along in  years. I completely love this Adam and have listened to it at least 10 times already if not more. I recommend everyone get this album.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|First, I just want to say that it's so good to have Garbage back. Their last two albums, 2005's \\"Bleed Like Me\\" and 2001's \\"Beautifulgarbage\\" left me unmoved, but \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" restores Garbage to their rightful place in the rock pantheon. I don't get all the negative reviews, or even the lukewarm ones. Is everyone deaf? Is everyone that jaded and cynical as to not realize that the band has come roaring back with strong melodies and memorable songs? Of course times have changed. Of course everyone is going to look to Bieber or Gaga. Of course Garbage is over 40 (heck over 50 if you exclude Manson). I don't care. These guys know how to make a pop song, they know how to turn a hook. And it doesn't hurt that they avoid singing about fluff. I get that they are too old to hold onto that teen angst, that they need to mature lyrically, but it's that sting, that bite, that still give them their vitality. I get that sometimes the angst sounds forced, but for the most part it still rings true.<br /><br />So, yes, \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" isn't for everyone, but it should be for the fans--the real fans--like myself. I have been there since 1995, since the beginning. I know Shirley would cringe to hear me say that I still believe she and fellow countrywoman Annie Lennox share much in common, not just in their beauty, but in their strict adherence to angst. I love it.<br /><br />Okay, so I bought the deluxe version with the four bonus tracks, and with or without the bonus tracks this is a five star album. I thought about whether this is four or five star material, and after repeated listening I am hard pressed to find fault with any of the tracks. That's no easy feat to disappear for seven years and then come roaring back with 15 solid tracks. I've read the complaints about over-production here, but I disagree. It's Butch Vig's complex production values that have always been Garbage's calling card. The key with \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" is that the melodies are the strongest they've been since 1998's \\"Version 2.0\\".<br /><br />The hits on this album are plenty and the band has actually chosen some of the best for their first four singles such as \\"Blood For Poppies\\", \\"Battle In Me\\", \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\" and \\"Big Bright World\\"--all excellent and catchy tracks. There's more, though, like \\"Felt\\", \\"Beloved Freak\\", \\"What Girls Are Made Of\\" and \\"Bright Tonight\\". Some of these songs lean dangerously into New Order and The Cure territory which is great because I like both of those bands too.<br /><br />The second tier of tracks don't quite match the greatness of the other eight I listed, but they don't detract from the album at all: \\"Control\\", \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\", \\"Sugar\\", \\"Man On A Wire\\", \\"The One\\" and \\"Show Me\\".<br /><br />I guess the only track I might complain about is the slight feeling of \\"I Hate Love\\", but that is a small complaint.<br /><br />Now, I am hoping this is a renaissance for the band, and that they will release another album in the next three years. I always felt their break-up was premature, and with only having released four albums at the time.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" compares to Garbage's other works:<br /><br />1995 Garbage: Five Stars<br />1998 Version 2.0: Four Stars<br />2001 Beautifulgarbage: Three Stars<br />2005 Bleed Like Me: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Not Your Kind Of People: Five Starsstrongest they've been since 1998's \\"Version 2.0\\".<br /><br />The hits on this album are plenty and the band has actually chosen some of the best for their first four singles such as \\"Blood For Poppies\\", \\"Battle In Me\\", \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\" and \\"Big Bright World\\"--all excellent and catchy tracks.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this album as the details became available. It didn't take more than a chord or two on the first song to alleviate my skepticism. This is a typical Crazy Horse album- stripped down rock with distortion, catchy melodies and great chemistry among the band. Like others, I'd probably prefer different material, but I'm  judging the album on it's own merits and in comparison to current rock albums- and it's strong work IMO.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I bought the audio version of this book 5 or 6 years ago (to learn English, actually !) and I must have listened to it at least 30 to 40 times. I simply love it. The story is great, the writing excellent, and the characters sound real. I loved it so much that I purchased every other book in the saga but I must say that none of the others, although some are very good, comes close to Ender's Game. Put some music in the background, relax in your favorite chair and get ready to be hooked by the story till the sun rises...
B0086700CM|5.0|YAY! I'm so happy they finally decided to get Temple Rum for the Kindle Fire. It's an awesome game, so much fun. Now I'm just waiting on Tap Tap Revenge to come :)
0553582038|5.0|This is my first book review ever.  I really enjoyed this book.  That's why I am writing this, I don't understand the negative reviews.  Yes, some of the main characters are missing, but I enjoyed the others.  The Jaime ones are good, if you had told me I would like his character when I started this, I wouldn't have believed you.  The Cersei ones were good too, she's so conniving and you can see how mad she is becoming, and she makes the book interesting.  Definitely letting the crown go to her head.  I actually found the Samwell ones the most boring, and other's have said they're the only ones worth reading.  Brienne is very interesting too.  The Ironmen chapters could have been shorter, but still were good.  I really liked this book, I can't believe how many negative reviews there are.  I just hope I like the next as much, it didn't get very good reviews either, hopefully they're as off and these are.

B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|Anno Domini High Definition is the fourth full-length studio album by the Polish Progressive Metal band Riverside. It was released in 2009 and is their first full length-album that isn't part of the conceptual series `Reality Dream.' The album consists of five tracks, arranged from shortest to longest, beginning with a five-minute track and ending on an almost twelve-minute one. It went gold in Poland and was surrounded by a considerable hype and expectation around the time of its release.<br /><br />The album moves a little outside the band's established sound (even the style of artwork is a different from the band's established tradition) and the music is a little funkier, more bass driven and a little more Deep Purple influenced than any of their other releases. There is less of a focus on texture and more of a focus on musicianship. The songs are still slow building, proggy and diverse in a way, but this is a notably different way than on their earlier albums.<br /><br />The fourth track `Left Out' for example is a slow and brooding key driven song that brings to mind Led Zeppelin's `No Quarter' as much as it does the softer sides of Camel, Pink Floyd, Opeth and the likes at the beginning at least, until of course it kicks into a metal section at the four minute mark, but then again even that is overlaid with Deep Purple sounding keys. By the nine-minute mark the songs sounds equal parts Tool and Dream Theater, while also having a sort of Pink Floyd's `One Of These Days' or `Sheep' feel to it. These sonic references are only loosely reminiscent though, not actual sound-alikes. All the music sounds like Riverside to one degree or another, which is part of the album's strength.<br /><br />It is difficult to really pick a favourite song or album highlight when you consider that there are only five songs and they are all great and that they are paradoxically similar in their diversity. They all mix metal moments with prog sounds, are instrumentally impressive, cover a lot of different moods each and all feature the same vocal style. Some tracks add Saxophone or Theremin and some feature less vocals than the others, but everything is of the same high quality, with about the same level of immediacy and about the same level of experimentation.<br /><br />Everyone's personal opinion is different though, and of course each and every one of them is as valid as the next. Some fans who liked the band since their early days feel that the record is too much of a departure from their established sound and some people who came to the band for the first time with this album also believe that it doesn't live up to the hype. Personally, I like the album an awful lot.<br /><br />Overall, Anno Domini High Definition is a superb album of diverse and musically impressive material that keeps me interested from beginning to end and I would strongly recommend it if you usually like this sort of thing.<br /><br />***  If you can get it for a similar price, try and get the version which comes with the Live In Amsterdam 2008 DVD.<br /><br />This is a professionally filmed 40-minute show consisting of seven tracks from the band's earlier works.  The tracklisting is: 1. Volte-Face 2. I Turned You Down 3. Reality Dream III 4. Beyond The Eyelids 5. Conceiving You 6. Ultimate Trip (shortened) 7. O2 Panic Room .<br /><br />They band are tight, focused and play on a good stage production (lights, camera movement and screens) to small but very an appreciative audience. It's a very enjoyable extra, especially if you are a new fan. ***a lot of different moods each and all feature the same vocal style.

0143119680|4.0|A Discovery of Witches is a fun and delicious novel full of ancient manuscripts, intrepid witches, steely vampires and quixotic demons. Writer Deborah Harkness takes us to Oxford and the Bodleian Library, old English lodges and Parisian strongholds. There is wine, candle light, libraries full of worn leather, and houses that transform themselves at will. Although Discovery is overflowing with adventure and romance, it is really a journey of self-discovery and knowledge. The real mystery that Dr. Diana Bishop uncovers is not an ancient missing manuscript, which everyone is fighting to get their hands on, but a woman discovering who she really is and learning to face the power within her.

B004CRR9G0|5.0|Nausicaa, released in 1984, is one of the best movies ever made. It can be enjoyed at many levels, and by children and adults. Nausicaa is a profound statement about the resilience of man and nature, and of the good that is at war with sickness of spirit. It teaches how good and evil war within man, creating the potential for small disasters and global disaster, and that our better side can triumph, both in small and great things. Nausicaa learns that sometimes good has to defend itself, and even kill, but there is more strength and wisdom in moderation and understanding, and there is virtue in community and tradition. Nothing, including the Toxic Jungle - which cries out to be shown in 3D- is what it seems on the surface. Life goes deeper than that. A girl shows the way. She should be the role model for daughters, and sons.<br /><br />Does Nausicaa wear underpants??  oh. the horror, the horror...<br />But she probably does, so not to worry. Her little skirt is just an outfit on an anime character and well suited to aerial acrobatics. In Kubrick's 2001 our great to the nth power ape grandparents are shown completely  naked.<br /><br />I want a Treefox.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|loved this game until about level 25 when all animals that i could get without spending my own money had been bought. The game needs to be more flexible and allow purchases to be made with fake or real money. I currently have 20 mill. and nothing to spend it on yet need hundreds of acorns to continue ( not going to buy them!!!!) that means I quit playing your money making game. By the way I think you have a glich. once you get an animal with acorns or a toy just put it in the collection bin download game again and wa la magic!!!!

B004XXIHS2|5.0|Absolute perfection. Mr. Levin has captured the sociopathic personality perfectly. The 'bad guy' is devious, manipulative, charming, cruel, meticulous, selfish, and narcissistic. This storyline flows smoothly. The writing is impeccable.<br /><br />The characters are well developed, believable, complex, and incredibly human. The narratives are perfect. There is no \\"drag\\" whatsoever in dialogue or description.<br /><br />A Kiss Before Dying is one of the most suspenseful novels I've ever read. I felt expectation and dread only to be brought back to curiosity and then back to expectation and dread, and finally relief. I read the entire book in one day.<br /><br />I wish I could give it 10 stars, but 5 is the max and 5 stars is my rating. I loved it!

0143038419|2.0|After reading this book cover to cover, twice I must add, the first thought that comes to mind when I think of the main character in the book is: RAGING NARCISSIST and then the next thing that comes to mind is NOT GENUINE. Sorry to burst your bubble. But think of it: at great expense to herself (supposedly) and (I am sure) to a magazine or sponsor, this woman spent months and months alone for the first time in her life (as she claims), traveling the world looking for enlightenment. She came out of a broken marriage to see the world and \\"find herself\\" and \\"learn to love\\". But the only person she really learned to love was the person she always loved: herself. After all that soul-searching, she dropped everything for a man. Of course she did. She was lonely and she could not deal with who she is. She had \\"actualized experiences\\" supposedly, experiences that only rich and connected people can have, at least according to my take on her book. So all that for a man? The minute she gets intimate with this man, she drops her mentor Ketut, who seemed to know her better than she knew herself. She hangs out with a medicine woman who tries to flim-flam her for money and whom she ends up lying to...very NYC, n'est-ce pas? Ketut had her number, and saw that she needed to be adored because she could not adore herself or love others without some adoration of her own. She could not shine out from the inside. She needed her friends in Italy before really enjoying herself--almost every enjoyable experience she describes is with others. Only one time does she mention sitting alone and reading the paper. She goes to an Ashram and cannot make it one day in silence, and must constantly be held up by Richard. And the Bali...geez. As for the man, she should have fit this man in her new life, not fit her life around this man. It is like she dropped everything she had learned for this man. Gag me! Nice fantasy, but a truly actualized person would not have hesitated to let this man in their life from the get go, and fit him in. It was fun, some parts were enlightening, and I learned some things, but I did not believe in the main character as a strong voice or a role model.fe from the get go, and fit him in.

1936608898|5.0|When my girlfriend and I first learned about Paleo and the Whole30 18 months ago, we used words like impossible, ridiculous, limiting and scary to describe the lifestyle.  At the time, we weren't seeking out Paleo as a cure for pesky medical conditions, to avoid diseases of civilization, or to lose weight.  Instead, we were looking for a diet that would support our training for a challenging season of races and physical challenges we had committed to.  I was also shooting for a personal goal of being in the best shape of my life upon my upcoming 30th birthday.<br /><br />Short story... I achieved everything I wanted to achieve physically that spring and summer. This included setting personal bests in strength, endurance and sprint events.  The caveat: I trained with less frequency and less intensity than I did the previous year - yet the results were considerably better.  The two Whole30's that I completed and the advice from Dallas and Melissa's website, Whole9life.com, gave me the edge I needed.<br /><br />There were some \\"side-effects\\" to the new lifestyle... 1) I was more productive at work and at home, thanks to energy that started earlier in the day and remained consistent throughout the day. 2) I became a much better person to be around thanks to my improved moods.  Before the Whole30, being friendly, perky and productive at 9am and/or at 2pm (during my afternoon energy crash) seemed highly unlikely. 3) Coffee is no longer a necessity in the morning.  Instead, coffee is a nice weekend treat (usually decaf) or used in the rare case of an early-morning \\"energy emergency.\\"<br /><br />This season, I did not take on a demanding race/fitness schedule. However, my commitment to the Paleo lifestyle (and periodic Whole30's and Whole15's) continues.  Why?  Because I feel better when I'm practicing Paleo. Simple.  After some recent health scares in my family related to cancer and diabetes, and considering my own lack of health insurance, long-term health is on my mind more than ever.<br /><br />In \\"It Starts With Food\\", Dallas and Melissa make a complicated, challenging and seemingly overwhelming life change seem practical, and at times, simple.  Those of you who are non-scientists and considering Paleo for the first time will appreciate the way that the Hartwigs make physiology, digestion and hormones palatable. Those who are Paleo-veterans will pick up a few tricks along the way and perhaps even correct a few of those \\"boarderline\\" eating habits.  Thanks to the book, I've identified a few easy ways to \\"clean up\\" my own lifestyle.  Since completing the book, I also find it easier to explain Paleo to others (because I simply understand it better). My only issue with \\"It Starts With Food\\"... that it wasn't published 18 months ago.  This book certainly makes a challenging and powerful lifestyle change so much more practical and do-able.  I've already bought this book for my parents, my sister and my best friend.  Each of them has already carefully considered Paleo before, but never has a resource been as practical and easy to understand as \\"It Starts With Food.\\" Deep down, we all know dieting doesn't work and processed food is bad.  So why not give a healthy lifestyle like Paleo a chance... if only for 30 days.

0345803485|3.0|I really did like the idea of the story. I mean come on; its a fantasy, the idea of this hot, unbelievably rich yet damaged guy is eventually \\"tamed\\" by this gorgeous yet unassuming virginal young woman, is completely ludicrous but makes for a titillating fantasy nonetheless.<br /><br />That being said, the cons of this particular book and perhaps trilogy [I have yet to read Darker and Freed] completely outweigh the good of what could have perhaps been a well written yet steamy best seller.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The repetition [why must she bite her lips or blush so often. And better yet why must it be stated so repetitvely. We get it. There is a whole list of repetitive phrases and thoughts mentioned in other reviews]<br /><br />-The age [The way the author describes Christian, his success, philanthropy, talents and back story, is just implausible for someone under 40. Why must he be in his mid 20's? This notion makes his character all the more unbelievable.]<br /><br />-The innocence [Hey, I lost my V card in my twenties. I'm not saying that Anastasia being a virgin is impossible. However, the author makes her out to be this goody-goody, gorgeous (but completely oblivious to her own beauty and sexuality) woman who is unaware of attentions from the opposite sex, and is a young woman who apparently has never masturbated or had sexual fantasies. As John Stossel says 'Give me a break!']<br /><br />-The writing [I can not get over how juvenile the author's writing is. It is so frustrating to see the potential of a subject or idea be brought down by the skill (or therefore lack of) of the writer.]<br /><br />-The sex [I do not understand why there has to be so many sex scenes after sex is finally introduced. Each sex scene is the same. Apparently this young newly de-virginized woman can climax at the brink of an eye or or twinge of a nipple, apparently. And really, must she have this earth shattering orgasm everytime, in which apparently Christian Grey can holding hisown big O like a wallet in his back pocket that can be released immediately after Anastasia has her O? And enough about the condoms. We get that he has to use it everytime.]<br /><br />Mind you, I am not a great writer and I am aware of that. However, I'm not about to take a page out of my mental diary to write a book about a sexual fantasy/erotica that I don't have the talent or knowledge to write for. How bittersweet (as she bites her lip ;p ). 2.5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. Its nice to do other activities besides just waiting around to make money. And as said in other reviews all you have to do to get back to your home screen is tap the &quot;stuff&quot; button in the lower right corner and there you go. I give this a 5 star rating!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I GREATLY enjoyed this book! I became addicted to the characters and story.  Some people may not like the basis for the story, but I liked it.  I was so addicted to the story that I had to do a re-read two days after I finished! I would recommend this book, gives you ideas about what you college life wasn't like, but maybe could have been!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had heard all the hype about Fifty Shades of Grey and thought I should check it out.  Except for a few cheap thrills, I didn't think the story was particularly well-written.  I was disappointed in the ending of the first book of the trilogy as I felt it left off so that I would have to read the next book.  I didn't like it enough to care what happened next.  I think the author should have written one good story and not try to cash in on a trilogy.
B00881VLCE|3.0|it is fun the app is entertaining I enjoy working puzzles it is better than other games it is captivating. I greatly enjoy it
0439023521|3.0|Engaging, it leaves you breaking your own promises to stop at the end of every chapters (as you need to catch some sleep). You will end up finishing it in just one seating. It is not really a book that requires much thoughts, interpretations, comprehension; you just keep flipping the page until the end, nothing to really tickle your mind nor making you think, characters lack depth (if you will). A simple story with good premise (e.g. Hunger Games); good pace, somewhat predictable from A to Z.
0307887448|5.0|One of the best books i've read in recent memory. Give this book a chance and you won't regret it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very detailed in sexual experiences. Shock is a definite factor in this book!! I will be reading the next in the series!!
1439127700|5.0|Let me start the review with my negative comment.  I think the authors had to stretch from time to time to fit within the title.  Rather than a focus on the interaction between the current and past presidents the book is really a series of vignettes concerning the holders of this office--some of which related to the relationship between men.  Having made the point I focus on the strength of this book.  It is a complete and very readable selective history of the US over the last 80 years.  We get to meet the presidents and begin to understand them as individuals.  Several of the chapters were wonderful.  Especially I enjoyed the relationship between Truman and Eisenhower.  Their coming together late in their lives was just a beautiful story.<br /><br />The section on Watergate provided an explanation of Watergate that I had not read about before.  As often happens the day after I finished that chapter I read a column by Bob Woodward that also describes the same event.<br /><br />There also were interesting portraits of our leaders.  The most difficult former Presidents were easily Nixon and Carter.  I think the finest ex President was Truman.  The relationships between the Bushes and Clinton was a great read.<br /><br />Overall this is a very informative and readable book
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game is good for like younger kids and that's preety much.But other wise its kinda good for like passing time or what ever I don't recommend this to you if you don't like games for kids and if your a tern like me... but whatever!!
B004EPYZV2|3.0|While the overall cast for this movie were picked well and played their roles well too the storyline felt so overplayed from other spy movies that have been released you don't feel any of the drama that's in the movie or feel any angst for what's happening to the characters in the movies either.  As you watch it unfold you feel more like \\"Wow, Ethan's being disavowed or setup yet again talk about bad luck.\\"  I understand the plot of the movie is mostly around him and his team but still while you see their situation and the plans they plot to clear them you're like \\"Why bother?,  you're just going to be disavowed again anyway.\\"  Also the angst they try to build up between Ethan and one of the teams member also feels cliche.  It's not that the infighting between the two team members isn't horrible it just again feels overplayed to much from past MI movies and other spy thriller movies.  I give the video and audio quality kudos though very detailed and sharp,especially as you hear the bullets fly or the explosions going off.  If you have the other MI movies then I say go ahead and add this one to the collection but don't expect this to be anything like James Bond which could be good or bad considering your likes...
B0086700CM|5.0|can lose myself in this game... not that I'm any good but def fun!!! hard but fast fun and amazing!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Its really good and addicting!  so far there's not problem with it. I'm VERY satisfied and a happy camper :D

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit, I wasn't sure about Wool at first. The customer reviews finally sold me on it and the first book of the series had me hooked! I instantly became part of the Silo, a citizen who became excited, scared, angry (really angry sometimes) and happy right along with the characters in the books. The way he writes of the people, you are right there with them, side by side in the good times and the bad....(and the carpet gets ripped out from under you a time or two). Many times I would respond out loud, \\"I knew it\\" or \\"Are you kidding me?\\" I highly recommend these books!!!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I knew I'd love this record after hearing the title track, and I do. Compares favorably with \\"But Seriously, Folks\\". Walsh has always been rock n' roll's class clown and that hasn't changed. But he writes some serious rock n' roll and that hasn't changed either. The addition of Jeff Lynne to Team Walsh has been a great choice, as he keeps the sound fluid and keeps Joe focused. Couldn't be happier with the 2012 version of Joe Walsh.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is their best record since 1991's \\"Roll The Bones\\". These guys continue to stretch the boundaries of what a three piece prog-rock band can do. This is a concept record, and while the concept is rather obtuse, who cares ? The music excells at every turn. Why aren't these guys a shoo-in for the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame ????

B007BRJYF2|5.0|Using my kindle fire and the game ran find.  Had a little trouble with some of the puzzles but that was my brain going blank.  Enjoyed the game.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This is the best calendar app out there compatible with the Fire. With that said, it's still glitchy and complicated. It almost has too many options to customize. It would be better to have at least a few predesigned options to choose from. But that's just appearance, i could see past that if the calendar itself ran smoothly. But it didn't,  at least for my Kindle and Photon synced through Google. I contacted Amazon about the issue and rather than fixing it they gave me a refund. I decided not to repurchase CalenGoo, think I'll hold out for something better to come along. But if I didn't have the luxury or waiting and needed a calendar on my Kindle Fire I'd go with this one, for now.
B0007PALRU|5.0|very good presentation of this film is great, has two very good dvds and a small book of the film very good buys
B004SDEP38|4.0|this is a really nice app for all my document/office needs on my mobile. so much better than the free app that came with the phone. i got it for free with a deal through amazon apps, though. i probably wouldn't have this if i'd had to pay so much for it. the price is the only reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars.
0307957934|1.0|(Spoiler Alert)<br /><br />Doggedly, I made myself finish The Fear Index if only to confirm the inescapable outcome of the story. This non-thrilling thriller garners its paltry one star rating because of its pervasive air of unreality. I am not referring to the virtual reality of the algorithmic global casino that Harris is at such pains to recreate for the reader, I am speaking of his near complete removal of human agency to explain the global financial catastrophe that continues to unfold. It is almost insulting to blame our economic and moral crisis on the Flash Crash without examining the deliberate policy decisions which made it possible. Certainly it is trivial to do so, an algorithm is a tool. As yet, a tool can be set aside.<br /><br />If you begin from the premise that Wall Street respects, let alone fears the authority of the alphabet regulators without even acknowledging the revolving door between New York and Washington you have not written a cautionary tale, you have written an apology. Undeniably we are on the cusp of the proto-conscious machine age that Harris describes, but human skullduggery yet reigns supreme.The peculiar bloodlessness of his tale is largely because Harris doesn't half believe its explanatory power himself.<br /><br />Thriller logic demands that Hoffmann live. Reader logic insists that sequel should never be written.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy these games.they are challenging and keep you intrigued. The first game was easy but after that it became a challenge. :)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I like a lot this final is very exciting and one of the best scenes was scene memories of snape, as well as the final battle of harry and voldemort, and above all the scene of children going to school in which his parents studied
B005IQZB14|5.0|Before reading a book I read a bit about it. . location, general story line etc.  After reading the summary I thought \\"oh no not another women who leaves everything and everyone she knows to \\"find\\" herself.\\"  I read books to learn about things other than what comes from my personal experiences so. . I pulled my bear trap mind open and read it with the intent of understanding and learning.  What I saw was a women who had no self worth and chose an a extreme way of healing. . .hiking the Pacific Crest Trail all 1,100 miles of it alone.<br /><br />Wilderness Therapy has been accepted as a viable program for troubled teens.  The concept being to get rid of everything and then start building value and worth from the inside.  When you don't have anything you can really put things in perspective.<br /><br />Sometimes I wanted to scream at her and ask if her if she lacking brain cell synapses as her choices so clearly were self sabotaging.  Being human is forgivable and I recognized that I had struggled with many of the same issues feeling no hope and watching your family go on without you is heartbreaking.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book. . .yes!
0307594165|4.0|Before I finished the first page of Toni Morrison's new novel, Home, she had me. This finely written story of a Korean War veteran, Frank Money, riffs on the nature of \\"home,\\" and every sentence is crafted in a way that tells Frank's story with just the right words. Morrison describes the time, the places and the community in ways that bring it all to life in a reader's mind. Treat yourself to a few very enjoyable hours reading this fine novel.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
1612130283|5.0|This book is amazing! I could not get through them fast enough, but now I'm sad their over! There is so much more of a story than just the erotica, which is the most intriguing part. I really hope she writes more books but from Christians perspective!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I think the price is a little high on this product, but even with that said it delivers on all fronts. I am happy with this product and it is a keeper. =D
0061692042|4.0|It's a rare novel that causes me to slow down my pace of reading. Richard Ford writes in a quiet and calm style that forces me to slow down, pay attention, and enjoy every sentence. His novel, Canada, is the best I've read this year, with one of the finest opening lines: \\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed.\\" Not a wasted word there, and certainly a gripper. The narrator is Dell, and he and his twin sister, Berner, face great loss in their lives when they are in their teens. Ford's masterful writing presents the motivations of characters with great care, and his deep understanding of human nature shows in his development of every character. Any reader who loves fine writing is likely to enjoy this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B002ZG97LK|5.0|My only con was wren.  I think it was the accent.  That and to me I couldn't get past being use to Kevin Bacon playing the part but I know he's way too old to play a high school kid now.  Julianne Hough sparkled on screen as ariel and I love that Kim Dickens played wrens aunt.  Hands down I love the new Willard more than the old one.  I watched it once by myself and once with my mother and both times we were laughing just about every time he went on screen.  They pretty much kept to the same script though there were differences.  I know the game of chicken was changed up quite a bit.  I guess kids nowadays are harder to entertain.  The juke joint scene was great.  Ive never seen one that nice before and being from the south Ive been in my share.  I think its a movie worth buying.  I spent 5 dollars renting it only to soon be buying it.  In theory I should have just went ahead and bought it.

030758836X|5.0|Talk about spinning an often-mundane occurrence, the wife goes missing, the darling, and benevolent woman who is kind and loved by all.  The husband becomes the prime suspect or the more nuanced term: person of interest.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn grabs this subject by choosing the fifth wedding anniversary of Amy Dunne and Nick Dunne.  Their married life apparently began in the ideal situation of an educated couple with good jobs frantically in love with each other.<br /><br />The reader is not sure what initially destroys their idyllic lifestyle.  Was it the economy?  Nick loses his job as a writer, which is Flynn's timely commentary on the loss of print journalism.  Amy loses her job of a personality quiz composer, but she has money because her parents are the authors of a previously popular series, entitled Amazing Amy.<br /><br />And Amy is amazing.  She shocks the reader with her diary, her plotting, skills and intellect.  Nick is more laid back and internalizes his feelings.  Now this is the best part: they are both very smart.  Flynn has no intention of insulting the reader with predictable and unintelligent characters.  She takes us inside the mind of Amy and on the periphery of Nick's as she dissects their pasts and places them in corrosive relationships.<br /><br />Flynn does not play favorites.  Nick and Amy both struggle; she is an equal opportunity writer when doling out mercy and punishment. The reader is shuttled back and forth into this marriage where the wife has crafted herself into the \\"cool girl.\\"  Nick, on the other hand, apparently is floating; her removes Amy (and some of her money) from New York and sets up The Bar with his twin sister, Margo, aka \\"Go.\\" Isn't Amy the most generous wife, stripping what's left of her trust fund to make Nick happy?<br /><br />This is a first-class thriller that kept me guessing.  I moved quickly from page to page, section to section, confident that Flynn respected the reader's intelligence.  I found all the characters fascinating, Rand and Marybeth, Amy's parents, Nick's demented father, Go and the police.  What a group.  The ending did not satisfy me, but it made sense not to conclude with a mollification of marriage.  I highly recommend this book.  Observing the ramifications of irrational self-serving individuals in a demoralized economy with Flynn's superior insight is special.cters fascinating, Rand and Marybeth, Amy's parents, Nick's demented father, Go and the police.

1440503257|4.0|Both of my kids love Harry Potter, and they both LOVE to cook with their dad (who, trust me, is the better cook!), so THE UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER COOKBOOK was certainly a fun choice for us.  The recipes in THE UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER COOKBOOK range from simple to complex, from familiar to strange, and from the sublime to the ridiculous.  It is arranged in interesting sections such as Good Food with Bad Relatives (clearly food at the Dursley House),  Delights Down the Alley (food from Diagon Alley), Treats from the Train (Hogwarts Express), Deserts and Snacks at School (Hogwarts), etc, but, for copyright purposes, none of the names I have here in parentheses are used.  But as you can see, it is ease to figure out where we are.  But pick a page, any page and you will find an interesting recipe - from hot chocolate to haggis, from marshmallows to a variety of meat pies (a little bit of Priest? No, wait, sorry, wrong movie...), from Lemon Drops to Cock-a-Leekie - if it was mention anywhere in the seven books of Harry Potter, it is in here, along with some delightful trivia about both the food and the stories.<br /><br />THE UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER COOKBOOK contains lots of recipes the kids want to make (and have made!) as well as lots of recipes that they look at me with that \\"uh, NO\\" expression that only kids can get.  But they still enjoy reading each one and remembering where it fits in to the Harry Potter books.  Overall, THE UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER COOKBOOK is a great addition to the kitchen or library of Harry Potter fans of all ages.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After hearing so much about the 'shocking' subject matter, I was on the fence at first about reading the books.  I finally thought 'what the heck' and downloaded them to my tablet.  I absolutely could not put it down, other than to sleep a little, and my analysis is that it is first and foremost a fantasy love story. The erotic stuff is just extra and adds to the love aspect.  I really care about these characters. Don't know how E.L. James could continue the story, but if she does, I will read it!

B006R1T40I|5.0|Not only is this the best Bonnie Raitt EVER, it is the best album I've heard in years.  Raitt produced this one herself, and her incredible touch can be heard on every cut.  I know, I know, sounds gushy, but this is one for those who love to really listen.  The instrumentals are stunning, bolstered by Raitt's signature slide guitar work.  The best part is that every song takes its time.  Nothing is rushed, everything feels very balanced, harmonic, and exciting at the same time.  The writer collaborators are variously gifted.  Go out and buy this.  My terrier ate my CD, and I had another one within days.

Well, my curiosity got the best of me and I regret the purchase entirely.  Anyone with a full and interesting sex life will be bored, too.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Snow White and the Huntsman is a film that captivates and excites the viewer within two hours and seven minutes.  And to add to the excitement, the main premise of the film that involves the classic fairytale character Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and a slightly different band of seven dwarves.  Along with Snow White, the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), who was called to capture Snow White and return her to Ravenna (Charlize Theron), the evil queen who is on the never ending quest for immortality; she preys on unsuspecting individuals and literally breathes the life out of them in order for her to maintain her youthful beauty.  However, Ravenna appears to possess vanity to the extreme, especially as she seeks guidance from Mirror Man (Christopher Obi).  Director Rupert Sanders adds an enormous twist from the original classic fairytale but not without subtly maintaining elements in the film that viewers will most likely identify.<br /><br />The title of the film may reveal much about the story of Snow White but diverts from the original story as well as the Disney film.  If viewers thought the Disney classic was dark and scary, especially as a child, one may see this adaptation rather more similar to the \\"Harry Potter\\" meets \\"Lord of the Rings\\" with a slight dabble of special effects on the \\"Terminator\\" side; it is the special effects and the cinematography that help to emphasize the dramatic and darker scenes in the film.  But in between the darker shades, there are lighter shades but rather brief when Snow White escapes the dark forest and encounters the seven dwarves terrain.  However, if one is looking for a classic song of \\"high ho\\" or birds singing along with Stewart, they will be disappointed; there are fairies and a deer-like creature that offers a hopeful moment for Snow White that is quite reminiscent of the Narnia films.  But the conflict ensues once more when Ravenna's brother Finn (Sam Spruell) and her henchman Aldan (Joey Ansah) wreak havoc and start a battle of flying arrows through the forest.  The film contains several battle scenes, but the most intense scene is the ultimate battle between good and evil, Snow White in her somewhat Joan of Arc regalia and Ravenna as a \\"black swan.\\"<br /><br />But as viewers will see with a story involving good versus evil, it is undeniable of what side will prevail.  Snow White and the Huntsman is a riveting film that may have viewers at the edge of their seat because although one may already know about the story of Snow White, this adaptation has unpredictable and surprising moments.  Indeed, a film recommended for viewers with an imagination.le of flying arrows through the forest.

B000P0J074|3.0|For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of \\"Beetlejuice\\" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, \\"Beetlejuice\\" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Petersonit was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny.

Still enough for the NC 17.<br />Fassbender and Mulligan do a stunning job as a brother and sister who cannot get along but need each other anyway.  He is a sexual compulsive and she is troubled and maybe prone to depression or instability.<br /><br />You can tell how much he hates his life as the story unfolds, and she doesn't like hers much better.<br /><br />The ending will leave you wondering if he learns anything.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game. even though you cant really attack the enemies, you can still use the power-ups to fight them. once again Glu made a great game.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this app is so awesome! you get to do adorable puzzles! all the puzzles on this app are fun filled!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is really the best game ever. I mean on my first try, I wasn't as good but I was hooked on it and eventually became the best. If your thinking twice before downloading this outstanding app, don't. Like I said before it's the best app ever.

0307951529|5.0|I read this book as I was graduating from college. It was an excellent read because it just plain got me excited about getting out into the world and making something of myself. Beyond the inspiring stories though, the book does an amazing job of letting you know ways that you too can make your skills pay out. As a result of this book I have gotten into making websites for people and have started writing my first book, a dream of mine. I don't expect to make much money off of my skills within the first year, but this book lets you know that it is possible and helps you figure out how.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I purchased the PC version and could not resist trying it on my kindle. The puzzles are challenging even after having played it before. The price is great. Hours of interesting and varied game play. By all means get this one.
1781161097|5.0|I was having a really hard time deciding what to get my step father and I ended up getting him this.  I have to say I'm very pleased with the result.  The book itself just looks really nice, it is slick and well put together.  Mostly I'm must happy because my stepdad is a big nerd (he's an aerospace engineer) and he's really hard to buy gifts for in general.
0099579936|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading this trilogy but very glad I did. I absolutely loved it. I couldn't put it down, and I was sad when I was finished reading all three books because it was over and I had nothing left to read. It is a book you either love or hate and I truly loved it. Wish there was a 4th book. I want more.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I bought this for my 14 year old son, he has not read it yet (of course!), but I decided to take a look. So happy I did. I am much more of an extrovert, so this book has been a great tool to help me understand this personality type. What a gift. It is truly a must read for anyone who has an introvert in their life and is not one themselves!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very erotic and captivating story line.  I can't wait to read the rest in the series.  And I will enjoy going to see the movies of this series if they are made.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book tells the true story of how the grunt soldiers won the Pacific war and the horrible conditions and heartbreak they had to endure as cannon-fodder.  As a teenager, I worked for a guy in Mobile, AL who was a Marine Raider in the Pacific in WWII and the descriptions in this book mirror some of the horror he used to describe when he had too much to drink (like many, it was the only time he would ever talk about it).  Prepare yourself for the horrors and agony of the real Pacific war and the brutality of the Japs.  If I hadn't heard it from my boss/friend first, it would be hard to believe.  Believe it!  It's worth every line to read.

B002PMPTIO|1.0|The 2009 \\"Star Trek\\" re-imagines the original crew as a mutual-admiration club of narcissistic youngsters, with Kirk (Chris Pine) as chief narcissist.  It aims to appeal to younger viewers while mollifying old-time trekkies, while pandering to the worst qualities of both.  The best aspects of the 1966 TV series have long since been forgotten.<br /><br />Have you ever looked at the night sky in awe?  Have you ever enjoyed the beautiful feeling of being just a little person in a vast, vast universe?  If so, this film is not for you.  I have never seen a space movie so perversely determined not to let you see any stars.  All the space shots are claustrophobic, saturated with looming ships, looming planets, debris, mist, flares and other obstacles, tightly arranged to blot out any suggestion of vast distance.  And this is only fitting -- any vision of the vastness of space might interfere with the glorification of Jim Kirk's godlike ego.<br /><br />The absence of stars is matched by the absence of trek.  A \\"trek\\" is a long and arduous journey, and the phrase \\"Star Trek\\" originally referred to the \\"five-year mission\\" which took the Enterprise far beyond Earth into unexplored regions of space, where the Captain and crew were essentially on their own and beyond help, and where each episode began and ended in deep space.  It resurrected the fantastic travelers' tales of yore, of voyages to uncharted islands, before technology made the world small.  But here, our heroes zoom back and forth between Kirk's house (Earth) and Spock's house (Vulcan) like joyriding teenagers.  Assuming they manage to further bloat their egos by saving the universe - or whatever - you can be sure they will manage to make it home for supper.  Will Kirk's parent-surrogates in Starfleet eventually reward him with his very own hot-rod?  Can you stand the suspense?<br /><br />The plot is extremely dumb on countless levels, which, to avoid spoilers, I won't go into.  I will mention one thing (which is far from the worst offense) simply because I have seen no-one else mention it:  Why would Starfleet rely on parachutes for a space-jump, when they clearly have super-advanced propulsion systems?  Even James Bond had jet packs.<br /><br />Remember that old Star Trek episode where where a virus had infected the crew, driving them insane and revealing hidden aspects of their personalities; where Sulu was running around with a sword for no good reason; where Riley kept singing 'Kathleen'; and where we had a confrontation between a red-faced Kirk and a weeping Spock.  Well, this movie is sort of like that, except that, since no virus is involved, the crew will presumably never return to normal.  All the characters are caricatures.  Spock in particular is an extremely emotional guy:  He is vengeful, snogs pretty girls in front of fellow crew, responds to verbal taunting with fits of violent rage, and is clearly attached to his mommy.  He is emotionless only in the sense that he is not quite as out-of-control as the hysterical Kirk.  Scotty and Chekov have been turned into comic figures, and are presumably inspired by the theory that there is something inherently funny about folks who speak differently.  Couldn't they have found an actor to play Scotty who actually knew the old dialect, and did not see anything especially funny about it?  Too much to expect, I guess.r from the worst offense) simply because I have seen no-one else mention it:  Why would Starfleet rely on parachutes for a space-jump, when they clearly have super-advanced propulsion systems?

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|OK, so it is NOT good. Bad!!!! This would be given -1stars if possible. The other two books are great. Unlike this book! (I learned this from a Harry Putter review) Never buy it. It is a total waste of money.
0545101417|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games is great.  Thankfully the book is read by the same woman who read the first one.  She does a great job reading, and if you liked the first Hunger Games book, you will love this one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Before I am hung by a tree (or pulled into The Red Room of Pain and beaten by horny women with floggers) I will admit that the book is steamy.  James sure does know how to write about sex.  But frankly, is that all one needs to deem a book a \\"great read?\\".<br /><br />50 Shades characters certainly weren't realistic.  Christian is a billionaire who, by age of 27, has created a huge fortune and business.  This isn't inheritance folks.  We are made to believe that it was done by hard work and effort.  Um.....okay......  Enter Anastasia Steele.  Ana is a virgin preparing to graduate college and happens to intrigue said hard-working billionaire hotty.  His good looks help Ana ditch her virginity and embark on a sexual journey that is far from vanilla and would be considered ridiculously obsessive by her college grad counterparts that enjoyed the activity at length during frat parties.  Moving on....  This romance is plagued with complication and all things that make for an unhealthy relationship.  Christian is a control freak.  Ana is insecure.  I wanted to shake her and scream \\"tell the boy to give you some space!\\".<br /><br />And there is the writing....  James gets an \\"F\\" as far as I am concerned.  I also agree with other observations related to the editing.  Was there an editor?  Maybe she is handcuffed to the bedpost in the Red Room.  Who knows?<br /><br />Bottom line- I will boycott the other two books.  I can only hope that this fad will not \\"torture\\" us for long and we can all move on to another trilogy with well rounded characters and better writing.
0545101425|4.0|The 3rd and final book in the Hunger Games series is good, but not as good as the first two books in the series.  The book on tape thankfully has the same person reading the book as the first two books did.  She does a great job reading, and keeping the listener engaged.  If you liked the first two books I would definitely recommend this one, although know it is not quite as good as the first two
B00773YOB4|4.0|It's not a nick of time (Sorry, but nick of time is what all her album will be weight by and it's not in that style) . But, it is a clean Bonnie Raitt album. With the blues foundation and the sweet taste of Ms. Raitt. Its a most have for a your Bonnie Raitt collection.
B00785P2QC|5.0|You do always end up buying points but they are cheap.  I enjoy playing it. My kids also enjoy it.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Pass on the game. I could not find the hints alluded to in other reviews. There were no game instructions that actually aided in play. I feel like I wasted my money.
B0006B2A42|2.0|Bad acting is never so fun as when it's done  by Ernest Borgnine. The movie is pretty lame, but still kind of ironically fun. I guess it was a big budget movie at the time but the arctic sets are not convincing. Howard Hughes must have been senile as well as schizo to go ga-ga over this movie - I really can't recommend it.
B000001EXR|4.0|How anyone could say that this is NOT a grunge style album is beyond me. \\"Rain\\" and \\"Hate\\" are so reminiscent of Alice in Chains type music (even down to the song titles). So is \\"In My Head.\\" So Kiss was trying to match a musical style of the moment. Take out Gene and Paul's voice, and the music is DEFINITELY grunge in style (of the heavier Alice in Chains mold). Throw some Danzig in there, too (like on \\"Master & Slave\\")... granted, not grunge. Say dark bluesy metal... but that's also Alice in Chains corner of grunge. There's nothing wrong with Kiss being influence by these styles. At the time, other older artists were dabbling, too. For example, David Bowie with Outside, with obvious NIN influences.<br /><br />So again... maybe saying \\"grunge\\" is too broad. But Kiss' take on Alice in Chains? That nails it. And to be honest, it's pretty interesting to hear.
B008AG3ASK|5.0|I mean, hey, you can pay around a hundred bucks a month for cable, and then add on SOME MORE money for premium channels like TMC, and watch the same movie eleventy times for a month....OR....you can pay Amazon 2-3.00 to watch what YOU want to watch when you want to watch it! I was really bummed that I couldn't watch Season Five of Mad Men because I refuse to pay those astronomical cable bills!<br /><br />Was really surprised and happy to find that I could watch the latest episodes of Mad Men right HERE on Amazon! $2.99 to watch it in HD! No contract! No crazy cable bills! Netflix will probably have Season Five of Mad Men available sometime in 2015 ;0)
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This is a brilliant book and the first in a trilogy.  E.L. James is a fantastic writer who gets you in from the very beginning.  The books are very detailed - i was sad to finish the last one.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I did not go see this movie at the theatre due to media reviews.  After renting on amazon primetwice I wish that I saw it on the big screen.  Being a sci-fi fan our family gave it a try.  Our 4 kids watched it twice.  The book series is free on kindle and started reading today.  I think many of the ideas in movies today came from the books.  My wife and kids enjoyed the story.  This reminded me of the C.S. Lewis sci-fi triligy in regard to Mars.  Anyway, after the negative reviews in the mainstreem media I wanted to give my feedback.  The scene where Carter was trying to learn to walk on mars is a classic.  If you are a fan of scifi you wont be disappointed.  Enjoy.
B0086700CM|4.0|I gave this game 4 stars only because I am a little frustrated that there are not different levels of difficulty.  My 5 year old would love to play but the pace is way too fast for her.  Otherwise a very addicting game and very fun.

B0088RQ4X4|1.0|This movie was very painful to watch.  How does a movie that has a civil war soldier, green aliens with tusks, flying spaceships, a gladiator scene fail so badly? I feel like I need to go wash my eyes out; I can't watch another movie ever.  I wish I could give this movie a rating of 1/4 of star.  I expected more from you Tim Riggins!
B00000JLWW|5.0|Everything I could say about Titanic has been said many times over. EXCEPT THIS....Jack lives on! Neither the director nor the producers ever point out, with dialog, this little hidden gem, other than to provide scenes showing our leading lady's film grand daughter's face in several shots also used to film Jack! Go ahead, put your copy of Titanic on and compare Jack's face in close ups with Rose's grand daughter's and tell me a little unspoken surprise makes you certain Rose had Jack's baby and his looks are SO obvious in his grand daughter's!!!!!! Enjoy!!!!

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Downloaded it while on sale for use on my Kindle Fire. Not sure I would pay more than the $.99 cent sale price, but it is useful enough I'm keeping it.<br /><br />Pros: Opened spreadsheet files (very simple spreadsheet) QuickOffice Pro could not open. Opens CSV files (not an advertised feature).<br /><br />Cons: Background task, cannot use hyperlinks in PDF files.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Although I appreciate the intent of this book, it simply is not for the experienced alternative individual(s).  The book speaks of \\"vanilla\\" yet the story itself is \\"vanilla.\\"  If you are serious about the lifestyle, and you know who you are, pass on the book.  It has absolutely no depth, no serious emotion and no entertainment value for those of us who truly are alternative.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I love it! Its my favorite game of all time and whoever you are you have to buy it! Its free so get it!

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I have to say I loved the first two books, this one only exploted women being cintroled and repressed'. It's shamfull this author would end the serious with such little respecet to womens rights and independence. I was so repalled by the fact that this author would write of a charachter that cannot even leave her apartment without permissiom, pathethtic to say the least in this era !  You disgust me, I cannot believe I wasted the money to buy the first two, you should forwver be shunned in the writ trees world!!!!!
0385360169|4.0|I'd have to say I enjoyed the book.  The love scenes were great and the characters were even greater.  Even though the story was good, I feel the book was just too long.  Some of the things that the writer elaborated on were not necessary. Overall, I'd have to say the book was very good, and in my opinion, the author did a very good job writing it.  I do plan to read the other two books as soon as I get some down time.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|This was a remake of a movie made twice before. I thought the special affects were slightly above average. I did not think the writing gave any thing new, original or interesting to the story.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is really fun to me. The point of this game is to create a town, full of shops and homes. To get lumber you have to cut down trees. That really the only problem. When you cut down trees they only give you like 6 pieces of lumber.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun to play. great graphics for kids. have a great time playing! this is really very easy to play. this game helps time to fly by during long car rides.

0399213015|5.0|My great-granddaughter wanted this read to her over and over again after receiving it for her 2nd birthday. She really loved it!
0300169787|4.0|Whenever I look through this book I am inspired to try something new with my clothing. This book will stay with me for years. All the clothes are incredibly stunning, truly works of art. It's a terrible thing that such a gifted designer would take his own life.<br />The clothes are lovely, and many of the quotes scattered throughout the book are intriguing. The preface/introduction is nothing special, rather dry and boring, but this is to be expected from a book whose main focus is fashion--and art--not gorgeous writing. Also that would be a little much to ask.<br />The interview at the end with Sarah Burton IS quite interesting, however.<br />A great coffee table book, and an inspiration to all fashionistas and art lovers!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is slightly addicting and challenging at the same time. Better than most games I have downloaded..and even better I got it for free!
B007P4OTHO|3.0|I am disappointed with the sound quality of the new vinyl remaster. To my ears it sounds as if it were sourced from a digital instead of analogue tapes. Although I have no way of knowing this I must say that my hifi system is very warm sounding not forward at all. I'm using an Conrad Johnson vacuum tube preamp with one of the best phono stages I've ever heard along with an old Rega P25 turntable which is known to be on the warm side, with a Shelter 501MKII low output MC cartridge. I did compare the new remaster to my old Mobile Fidelity JVC pressed Japanese vinyl copy from the 1980's and while it's not quite as dynamic sounding as the new record the mofi sounds much more natural, (analogue like), in my opinion. It also has a wonderful warm midrange presence that beats the heck out of the new Ziggy pressing. However, for those that don't have a good copy of the original British pressing from the 70's I would still recommend buying the new 2012 LP which sounds much better than the horrible SACD that came out a few years back. Plus you get a free DVD remaster thrown in as well with multichannel sound for the home theater crowd.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|I'm not going to comment on the songs. They are all great, the executions are all great. But my Goodness, the sound.... it is beyond bad. I'm a drummer, recording engineer and audiophile. Dear RUSH, one piece of advice: Let go the computer. Make a commitment to NOT use any more plug-ins just for the sake of it. Where is Mr. Paul Northfield? He is the one who knows how to record and mix RUSH. I bought the CD, didn't \\"download\\" compressed crap, thinking it would sound as good as the RUSH CDs from the 90's and before. Sadness indeed. Didn't happen. Go re-record this album using a 2 inch analog tape machine, go Neve or SSL consoles... transfer it to the computer if you want, but for crying out loud, let Mr. Northfield do his magic. PLEASE.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been listening to this album a lot, and again... I can't accept the sound quality. Over use and abuse of compressors during mixing. I BET this album has been entirely mixed using in-ear reference monitors, on tired ears. The problem with this approach is that the unexperienced mixing engineer will undoubtedly abuse EQ as well. Excess low end, and excess of high end frequencies. This album sounds dull, insanely over compressed, no dynamics. This is, without a doubt, the worst RUSH album of their career, in regards to sound quality. They need to get the original flat recordings and give them to someone that knows how to mix and master.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: OMFG you can actually hear the compression on Neil's drum kit overhead microphones! Go to track 11 \\"Wish them well\\" and cue to around 2:25 and you can hear the woooosh of the compressor getting out of the way on his crash cymbals. SHAMEFUL! The cymbal attack is compressed and its shimmer isn't. How Neil, Geddy and Alex approved this for release is beyond my comprehension. Really, all I can say to them is I \\"Wish them well\\"...!
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I was there when these songs came out. So I'm presumably at a disadvantage in appreciating these Glee-ified remakes. [Anyone who has seen one episode of the show will recognize the style: earnest enunciated vocals, massed background singers, etc.] But to my surprise, they got the job done.<br /><br />It helps that these are, for the most part, well-written songs. It also helps that, except for tasteful abbreviation, the performers wisely stick to the originals note-for-note. [i.e. Cruise does both the \\"Bay-buh!\\" and the \\"Unh!\\" at the end of \\"Paradise City\\".] When they don't - Mary J. Blige is the guiltiest in this respect - it is always to their disadvantage.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones is a product of musical theater, so perhaps we should not be surprised that she acquits herself so creditably on \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\". But if anyone suspected that Tom Cruise had this in him, I was not among them. It took courage for him to undertake a singing role at all. To tackle the repertoire of powerful singers like Lou Gramm and Axl Rose took big brass ones.<br /><br />To be sure, lyrics like \\"Just an urchin living under the streets\\" and \\"The bitch is hungry / She needs to tell\\" expose him as someone *acting* the part of a rock singer rather than the genuine article. But that fits in seamlessly with the artificiality of the project as a whole.

1936608898|5.0|I've been following Melissa and Dallas's eating guidelines since 2009. One of the things that I found most irresistible about their Whole30 is that they are able to present their case in ways that made it impossible to say no. What they say is so reasonable -- \\"Just try it and see how you feel. There is no counter argument. Now imagine that case-building awesomeness for 300 pages. At each turn, the authors anticipate your concerns, your questions, your hangups, and they provide science, anecdotes, and encouragement to help you overcome your hesitations.<br /><br />Starting with the Good Food Standards, It Starts With Food progresses through the foods that make us less healthy, including the all-important how they make us less healthy-- then moves into the good news: foods that make us more healthy. For paleo people, the food lists aren't surprising, but the wealth of details about the why and how is eye-opening.<br /><br />The second half of the book addresses pressing practical matters: meal planning, portion sizes, and the holy grail of kicking ass in the name of your own good health: the Whole30. But again, this is the Whole30 through a new lens, with lots of additional details about how you'll feel during your Whole30 and why.<br /><br />For those of use who are special, special snowflakes with past eating issues or health concerns, the chapters that deal with strategies for long-term success and special populations are especially helpful. If you've completed a Whole30 you know, when the \\"safety\\" of the rules ends, it can be even more challenging to remain true to those shiny new habits. The practical information in these chapters is dead-on.<br /><br />5 Other Awesome Things About The Book<br /><br />1. They understand the emotional side of the equation.<br />Food is more than nourishment for our bodies. We eat for all kinds of reasons: emotions, hormonal wonkiness, hunger. It Starts With Food respects the complicated relationship we have with food and addresses these \\"squishier\\" issues, along with the science. And while Melissa and Dallas are well-known (and well-loved) for their tough love approach to the Whole30, their book delivers the science with compassion:<br /><br />\\"You struggle with food cravings, bad habits, compulsions, and addictions. You know you shouldn't, but you feel compelled to eat these foods. Sometimes, you don't even want them, but you eat them anyway.... All of which makes you feel guilty and stressed--and more likely to comfort yourself with even more unhealthy food. We're here to tell you: It's not your fault. You're not lacking willpower. You are not lazy.

The info is rich; the design is playful.<br />This book is serious in the value it provides, but it's fun in the way it delivers that value. Throughout the pages, sidebars, a funky font, and illustrations keep you moving and break up the information into bite-sized chunks -- all without sacrificing the flow of the story. Melissa and Dallas weave a tale that makes the conclusion inevitable: this is the healthiest way to eat. But the journey to that conclusion is enjoyable and manageable.<br /><br />3. Sass, baby.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|What better tale to tell than that of an irascible, vain, honorable, loveable, and emotionally available, ordinary man rising to heights even beyond his own imagination, with and because of the deeply felt love and vital support of a woman like the inimitable Abigail Adams, without whom John himself knew, he would have been a lesser man. Thanks to their own collected letters, numerous writers, most importantly here, McCullough's fine book - the story of John and Abigail Adams is one of the best American love stories imaginable. Every element of this production - actors, script, direction, cinematography - is a testament to the inspiration of the material and the professional artistry of everyone involved. And the bonus - it is America's history with all the warts, all the well-deserved glory, and all the sadly tragic, yet inspiring reality. On a level with \\"Brideshead Revisited,\\" \\"Tinker, Tail, Soldier Spy\\" (original), and most recently \\"Downton Abbey,\\" \\"John Adams\\" is an example of the emotional power and and intellectual reward that can be reaped from dedication to the screen arts! What flaws there are - and they are few - are, as expected with anyone you might observe so closely, easily forgivable for the pleasure of their company.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I find it ironic and perversely satisfying that \\"Prometheus\\" is getting such mixed reviews. Why? Because it only reinforces my opinion that this is some kind of great movie, to paraphrase an old friend. And furthermore, because this is EXACTLY what happens to director Ridley Scott when he makes science fiction films. Look back at some of the contemporaneous reviews of 1979's \\"Alien\\" and 1982's \\"Blade Runner.\\" When you do, you'll find a lot of vitriol being directed at Scott by film critics.<br /><br />One tired gripe, which is resurfacing with \\"Prometheus,\\" is that Scott puts the visuals ahead of the story. I think that is baloney. Yes, the visuals in \\"Prometheus\\" are astonishing, but science fiction MUST look good; it must astound us and fill us with wonder. Besides, the story here does have depth -- it's just that Scott, as always, is asking you, the viewer, to do some of the work. This is in the grand tradition of another filmmaker, by the way -- Stanley Kubrick, who directed \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" And Scott has said in recent interviews that \\"2001\\" influenced \\"Prometheus.\\"<br /><br />I am not ready to say that \\"Prometheus\\" is in the same league as \\"2001,\\" which stands as one of the greatest movies of all time, science fiction or otherwise. But it shares some of the themes of \\"2001,\\" including the idea that some sort of alien presence manipulated things here on Earth so that humans would evolve into the dominant species. Also, \\"Prometheus\\" refuses to answer all the questions it poses, just as \\"2001\\" did. To me, that's the sign of great storytelling, whether the medium be film, novel or stage play.<br /><br />I think \\"Prometheus\\" will -- as \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" did -- acquire more stature over time. Meanwhile, naysayers might want to note that as of December 8, 2012, the film has made more than $400 million worldwide, meaning it has recouped its cost, and then some. Clearly, the film is reaching a receptive audience.<br /><br />In addition to its other strengths, the theatrical version of the film deployed some of the best and most subtle 3D visuals to date. I am happy to report that the Blu-ray 3D version looks every bit as good on my TV, despite the much smaller picture. The 4-disc edition (3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray special features, DVD/Digital Copy) contains seven hours of bonus materials.<br /><br />I agree that \\"Prometheus\\" is not perfect. My biggest complaint is that the picture clearly was written with a sequel in mind -- the ending practically screams the word \\"sequel,\\" to be honest. Back in the day, though -- I'm talking more than half a century ago -- one could go to the theater and see science fiction and other genre pieces presented in serial form.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, \\"Prometheus\\" is a winner. Why? Because, in the end, it is greater than the sum of its parts. The holes in the story, the mediocre acting by some of the minor cast members, the occasional bit of silliness -- all of that can be forgiven, for this is a film that asks huge questions about who we are, how we began, and what we might become as a species. \\"Prometheus,\\" like its namesake, is overly ambitious, but I'd rather have that, any day of the week, in my movies, music and literature. Far better to aspire and fall slightly short than not to care at all.engths, the theatrical version of the film deployed some of the best and most subtle 3D visuals to date.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I kept hearing how great these books were and I finally purchased them on my Kindle Fire.  WOW!!!!  I can't believe how well written they were and I just didn't want to put them down.  It was great reading and the writing was wonderful.  You would be reading and feel so bad for the lady and then you would start to understand how he felt and why and you was all for him.  I know that by the end of the second book I was torn between the two characters;  but when I started the third book I was definitely in his corner and she was making me angry at her actions.  I can tell you my poor Kindle was on fire when I was reading.  I couldn't take it to work or I would have been wanting to go on break all day so I left it at home and started to read after I finished my evening chores.  I know my daughter and another friend have read them all a second time and they told me you interpret it another way in some of the events the second time around.  I just wish I was over laying on the beach in the Carribbean soaking up the sun and reading this set another time.  I know there are some risque parts that might \\"offend\\" some people;  but it is a book and really who knows what goes on behind people's closed doors.  I can say that it will make your day better to be immersed in someone else's problems.  Enjoy!!!  I certainly did and you will also.

0393338827|3.0|In The Big Short, Michael Lewis takes a look at the subprime crisis from the standpoint of the few individuals that bet on the crisis, and the resulting money they made. The book is best at the end, where Lewis points out how the bankers even as the house of cards was crumbling, were still in denial of the magnitude of the events, events that he shows from the standpoint of the shorts of the CDO's, were virtually guaranteed to happen.<br /><br />The book lacks much interest in the middle,as it covers the lives of the shorts of the CDO's, how they came to make the bets that they did, and how the banks simply refused to understand what they were doing. In terms of now, from the JP Morgan 2 billion+ loss on a complex financial trade, it is still a problem. How can one effectively manage risk, when the entire game of the system is to make things as complex as possible? However, here in is mostly a rehash of continuing statements about how right these people were. There is nothing wrong with that, as they certainly were, but it was not necessary to repeat past a couple of times.<br /><br />The book doesn't tread new ground, for many (though not very many to be sure) called for a correction in the housing market. I remember reading from CNNMoney and Fortune magazine the correlation between housing prices and rents, something that, at the time was broken, but that had to correct, there was simply nothing else to do. The housing crisis simply came from an avalanche of bad debt, something that need not have happened, and something that the story never attempts to look at. I am not simply speaking of the \\"new normal\\" that people get burned by, every time a bubble blows, but from the fact that had housing prices collapsed in only a few areas, rather than the entire country, the story would have been much different for all involved (and us, as we had to backstop the banks from a total financial collapse)<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that focuses on just the housing/banking portion of the collapse, I would rate the book 4 stars, and give a solid recommendation. I can't fault Lewis from writing what I would consider half a story. However, if you want a book about the collapse, from all viewpoints, including the frauds committed by the borrowers (to use his own example, the strawberry picker, how was given a 750K mortgage, Lewis absolves from all guilt, despite the fact that the man was guilty of fraud, and had to know that he was.), to the corruption of the government at all levels (and parties), to Fannie/Freddie, as well as a more detailed look at the corruption of the ratings agencies. If understanding of the collapse is what you are looking for, this book isn't the one you should read.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|Bought this headset a while back. This was my second and last purchase from Turtle Beach. The quality of the microphones and headset is amazing! However, the reliability completely destroys the good review. I take amazing care of my headphones and for $80 headset I expect more durability. After about a month the quality diminished exponentially. The sound was starting to muffle and crackle. If you plan on using this with a computer as well, get used to feedback. The motion with the mouse creates static within the headset (tried several mice to see if that was the problem). When you scroll down there is static mimicking the movement. When you click there is static mimicking that as well. After about 2 months the right headset broke off. Like I said before, I take great care of my headsets. But for an $80 headset to be made of such poor material is insulting. There is no difference in my opinion between this headset and a cheap $30 dollar one. If you want a reliable and great quality headset, just spend the extra $20 on the G930.

0399159029|4.0|This latest installment of the Bernie Gunter novels seems to have been written in a bit of a hurry. The plot essentially involves a who-dunnit murder enquiry over a long weekend in one location (Prague), with predictable outcomes that become obvious to the reader early on. While all the elements of the otherwise excellent series are here (the ambivalent down-to-earth figure of Commissar Gunter,  a cynical sense of humor,  the moral dilemma of trying to stay true to human values in an inhuman time), the story line in this particular novel lacked the intricacy of its predecessor, FIELD GREY, and very disappointingly does not continue the thread of Gunter's post-war story that ended with a surprising ending in the last book. Contempary references are sometimes entertaining (e.g. Hugo Boss uniforms) but an unnecessarily detailed description of waterboarding in this book is somewhat grating. Some of the characters (such as Gunter's love interest) lack depth and remain close to cliches, and several of the German language references have spelling errors, which suggest that the book could have done with a bit of editing.

0684857219|5.0|This is my 2nd purchase of this book.  My first volume literally fell apart from many years of use.  It provides a tested approach to body development, both strength and stamina.  I'm especially fond of the insights that can only be brought to the reader by experienced lifters.  Bodybuilding is not a casual effort and the book underscores the importance of commitment.  I've always been a power-lifter, thought Posers were freakish narcissists.  However, this book gave me an appreciation for aesthetics and balance.  The progressive workouts provide a proven path to personal development that will keep things interesting when you're all alone in the gym @ 3:00am because that's the only time you can gather all the plates you need to reach your target weight.  It warns against over-working areas of the body and developing an asymmetrical composition.  It also explains how body type will influence your results and the importance of genetics.  The candor of the book is amusing and pragmatic.  It keeps things real, especially when discussing individual results.  Using this book I've been able to attain dense muscle mass, great strength and develop a well-balanced composition; all with reduced risk of injury using the progressive levels of effort.  Moreover, the book provides exercise options for keeping muscles out of their comfort zones to maximize success.  I haven't seen any material that is superior in all areas to this book.  Everyone can benefit from the wisdom in this book but not everyone who applies this book will develop into a competitive bodybuilder.

0099579936|5.0|I'd heard  so much about this book and even saw reports about hardware stores selling out of rope because of it that I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about. I read the first three chapters and immediately bought the trilogy. I hate romance novels but I made an exception for these. The sex scenes become a little repetitive as the books go on, but the characters and plot twists make up for it. I found myself cheering some characters on, wishing others would just disappear and got tear-y eyed a few times.<br />I finished the series in under a week but I'm still perplexed about the rope selling out since rope it's really mentioned.<br />Ps if you're buying this because you like erotica, you might be disapointed, it's really a romance novel.

0670023329|3.0|A tragic and powerful story conveyed by the American journalist. Why split the proceeds 50/50? It's Shin's story, his suffering, his journey - one of the rare cases when 100% of the proceeds should have been donated to the subject of the story. Especially given the prestige and privilege of an American journalist compared to a North Korean refugee.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I love the Rush community & passion we have for a band that has hugely influenced our lives...<br /><br />Let's face it, listening to a new Rush album is overwhelming.  So much to hear, digest..some songs immediately liked, others unsure..  time goes by and we put the necessary time in, songs become distinguishable from one another, parts are picked up that were seemingly unheard from the first several times you listened.. then it  clicks and you see the light.<br /><br />It's impossible to review a Rush album in a week, these guys put hundreds of hours in to this work of art.  Nearly all of us will see these songs live in the next year, let's save the review for the day after.  I guarantee we will all be floored!!!<br /><br />How lucky we are, 38 years into this and still getting the experience the greatness of Rush, evolving, changing, improving and continuing to positively impact our lives.  Thank you Geddy, Neil & Alex!

B0064MT1FI|5.0|Fabulous photography, very surprising and enlightening movie about how women once (and probably still have to) endure in order to survive.  Amusing in some parts - however a wonderful story about survival, the 'chance' of life and how love and life can be found again. Great scenery!  I only have two DVDs that I've found worth purchasing to watch more than once - this, and 'Out of Africa.'  Good purchases.  A great movie to watch with other women and then discuss - my church loved it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun and addicting. The graphics are great and story line isn't half bad either. Would tottally reccomend as a boredom buster
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I just finished the first tome of the series. It is incredibly intense, well written, with a killer plot. In the beginning I got somewhat confused by the myriads of characters that were introduced. In the Book Extras on my Kindle, I was able to read up on the individual characters, which helped with my reading pleasure. Plus there's an appendix at the end in which the author breaks down all the various houses and their members.<br /><br />Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the characters. This method of story telling keeps the reader interested and the plot remains fresh. There is a LOT of violence - pretty graphic, and there's a lot of sex - both good as well as horrific gang rapes (in my opinion a bit too much of the latter). Overall, this book is not funny at all. The only character who has some humor is Tyrion - the Imp. Other than that, most of these people take everything pretty personally; so don't expect comic relief. However, the author manages to get you invested in each character's development and fate. I did cry a few times (no spoilers), and the book ends with a bang.<br /><br />There were some inconsistencies in the story as well as repetitive wording that made me wonder about the editing of this book. However, none of this was bad enough to deter from the wild entertainment that Game of Thrones offered this reader. I'm going to have to get the second volume immediately.

How about the function?  The D700 drive was sped up by its grip, but the D800 is not sped up by this.<br /><br />Why?  Because they they lost D3 sales to D700s with drives. And they don't want to lose D4 sales to D800+grip combos.<br /><br />BTW, the D700 with grip was a great combo; with it you had reasonable speed - not quite a D3, but still good - and without it the camera was the size of a consumer camera.<br /><br />Pathetic.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am not sure what to make of this book.  I loved the characters and the ability of the author to keep the tension up.<br /><br />However, the over-descriptive prose caused me to skip page after page just to get anywhere.  It was brutal in a few parts.<br /><br />small spoilers<br /><br />I had a hard time with the believability and scale of the silo, along with some of the technology.  That their technology, which is somewhat basic even by today's standards, can last for hundreds of years is hard to accept.  The logistics of keeping the place running for that long is not explained well enough for my taste.  I need something more.  This book is more a drama, and less a science fiction book.<br /><br />luckily the characters fight to uncover the truth, and stay alive, is good enough that I can turn off my brain for a bit.<br /><br />Am looking forward to the next book

0345803485|2.0|The writing is elementary I must say, but the book does have some appeal. My main concern is the main character. *takes deep breath* her internal dialogue makes me want to blow my brains out with a .444 marlin. Ana, the main character, is constantly questioning her feelings and her actions toward Christian and his lifestyle. She NEVER comes to term with ANYTHING. She constantly complains and tries desperately to pry into poor Christians past. Mind you, he constantly tells her that he's uncomfortable with divulging his past to her, yet she continues to pry nonetheless. And also, what annoys me, is that she refers to Christian \\"wanting to hurt her.\\" she knew the terms of their engagement and also, she knew of the lifestyle Christian was into (He gave her more than enough warning). At some point, you stop questioning and start accepting. That never happens with Ana. She's so fickle it's wholly vexatious. Ana does portray a real, genuine personality, I can attest to that. I know of several girls who are just like her, annoyingly innocent and fickle in their relationships. The story wasn't a complete bust, in fact I did enjoy the email conversations between Ana and Christian. I also love Ana's best friend Kate. All in all, this book gets 2 stars. It's overpriced and Overrated.

0765326353|5.0|I was skeptical about \\"The Way of Kings\\".  I had read \\"Warbreaker\\" and had thought it was okay.  The \\"Mistborn\\" Trilogy never took off for me and I abandoned it in the middle of the first book, though I keep intending to revisit it.  I could see the incredible talent in Sanderson though and so when \\"The Way of Kings\\" came out, I was tempted.  But I resisted.  Then the reviews started coming in and, oddly enough, all the praise made me even more skeptical.  Could it be that Sanderson really had tapped his potential and become the great author of epics that he clearly had the potential to be?<br /><br />Having now read the book, I can say that the answer is, without a doubt, a resounding \\"yes\\".  This is truly a wonderful book that captured my attention that no fantasy work has since I read \\"The Eye of the World\\" more than a decade ago.  The world is crafted in exquisite detail, the characters are...incredibly human and the narrative is tight, believable and very much organic.  There are certainly moments when you clearly see a major plot point coming but that is because Sanderson led you there, not because the plot is transparent.<br /><br />Very simply, I cannot wait for the next book and I would recommend this heartily to anyone who enjoys epic fantasy even a little.

0374203032|5.0|I don't quite know where to start with this book. In many ways it is exactly the book that I expected, but there are so many surprises that it left me speechless--actually depressed would be a better word.<br /><br />Even though I grew up in the 50s and 60s, I've never been one to pine for \\"the good `ole days.\\" I remember vividly how blacks were spit on and abused by whites where I lived, and were even required to leave town before sundown. I remember how women were expected to stay in their \\"place,\\" and how the ones who did not were ridiculed and put down. I remember my gay friends from school who were such caring and wonderful people, but who were not allowed to just be. I even remember the uproar about having a president who was \\"governed by the pope.\\"  Those and other equally horrid things remind me that I have no desire to go back. Those were not simpler times, unless of course you were a WASP male. There was absolutely nothing simple about those times even, I suspect, for a few WASP males.<br /><br />I'm not certain how I would have turned out had my school been sponsored by Hershey's Chocolate providing curriculum materials that promoted their product. After all, my parents owned a grocery store giving me access to all the Hershey's chocolate my stomach desired and that was a lot! What about my classmates? Would they have desired more Hershey's chocolate?  What if we'd had Channel One in our classrooms providing corporate advertisers a young captive audience for 2 minutes out of every school day?  \\"The biggest selling point to advertisers [is that] we are forcing kids to watch two minutes of commercials. The advertiser gets a group of kids who cannot go to the bathroom, who cannot change the station, who cannot listen to their mother yell in the background, who cannot be playing Nintendo, who cannot have their headsets on.\\" (Quote of a Channel One executive, p. 197). What I would like to know is, did this person say this with a straight face? Have we become so insensitive that an adult can talk about our children in this manner publically, with apparently no embarrassment?<br /><br />Or what about the curriculum materials for fourth graders provided to schools by Scholastic (a well known educational publisher) and which were funded by the American Coal Foundation, extolling the benefits of coal while failing to mention any of the negative aspects such as mining accidents, pollution, toxic waste, etc? Oh, and my favorite, a \\"science\\" experiment funded by Campbell Soup in which the students were shown how to prove that Campbell's Prego spaghetti sauce is surely thicker than General Mill's Ragu! (Duh! It's the taste, stupid!) This would be hilarious, if it weren't so sad. From what I know about teens, there were probably more than a few saying, \\"Really? You want me to do what?\\"<br /><br />In Mr. Sandel's view, what is reprehensible about the above examples is that it is \\"at odds with the purpose of schools.\\" Education is meant to provide us with the means to reflect upon our choices and make wise decisions, while advertising's whole purpose is to prevent that from happening. \\"Buy this! Don't think about it! Buy it now!\\" He also states that \\"The purpose of advertising is to recruit consumers; the purpose of public schools is to cultivate citizens.\\"<br /><br />A theme throughout Mr. Sandel's book that I've never thought about before is the difference between a \\"fee\\" and a \\"fine.\\" A fee implies something a person chooses to pay above and beyond the cost of something in order to receive a good or service that she wants. A fine, on the other hand, is not a choice and sometimes carries with it a moral message of sorts. People are embarrassed, or at the very least are required to reflect, by a fine, but feel vindicated and non-reflective when they pay a fee. A couple of the examples he mentions are the Shakespeare in the Park series in New York City. This is a free venue provided by the city--through taxes collected--so that allNew Yorkers have access to live theatre. It still requires a ticket in order to limit the number of people in the venue at one time, for safety. However, when the cast includes well known performers, the tickets show up online in places like craigslist for hundreds of dollars, and as you might imagine people will buy them. This is a fee. He also uses the example of a day care center, concerned about rude parents who showed up after closing time to collect their children, forcing teachers to stay after and miss time with their families. The center charged parents a fine according to how late they arrived. Still parents arrived late, so the center decided to raise the amount considerably for those parents to make showing up late less attractive. The mistake they made though was to call the charge a \\"fee,\\" rather than a \\"fine.\\" Suddenly the number of late parents increased!  Now that parents thought they were paying a fee for service, there was no moral obligation to show up on time. \\"I'm paying for it, therefore it's mine to use.\\" Mr. Sandel's argument is that we've become acclimated to paying the fee and not having to suffer the moral embarrassment of paying the fine. In fact, we seem to have decided that the former is preferable to the latter. The questions the author thinks that we should consider are, where is this taking us morally, is it worth it, and are there appropriate and non-appropriate moments for just paying the fee with no consideration of the moral? In the examples with the schools, the \\"fee\\" paid is the minds and hearts of our children.<br /><br />There were many points mentioned where the people who can afford to pay the fee obviously get preferential treatment, some we all know about such as the airport security \\"line-jumpers\\" who are either first-or business-class passengers, or who simply pay more for their tickets. This infuriates me because of what it says about our \\"security.\\" Oh, OK, I want to blow up a plane, hey just pay more for the ticket! Duh. There were also some that surprised me. For example, I recently visited my grown children in Northern California. My daughter was driving us on I80  in that horrendous traffic that California is infamous for, and people in cars with only one person were whizzing by us in the HOV lane. She and I were discussing the fact that this was illegal. Well, turns out it isn't. People there can pay a yearly fee and drive the HOV lanes to their little, I-don't-give-a-damn-about-the-environment heart's content! Gee, and California! Imagine that! The state where people are so concerned about the environment as to make the rest of us feel dirty! Sorry, I digress. In California's defense, San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles are not the only places you can pay and play on the freeway, there's also Minneapolis, Houston, (Hey, I used to live in Houston, and I don't think I'd have the nerve to pass up angry people stopped in traffic on the freeway, no matter how much I paid for the privilege!), Denver, Miami and Seattle.<br /><br />This is one of those books that will encourage conversations and reflection.

B007XH6BPG|2.0|Say what you want about the bombastic and overblown excesses of mid-period prog, but at least Anderson and Gabriel had clear visions that translated into well-considered lyricism. This record is a perfect example of what adept musicians should avoid, when they hit their golden years. The lyrics are so LAZY! \\"Let's do a song called 'Stormchaser'!\\" First of all; don't. Secondly, if you DO, try a little harder than \\"stormchaserrrrr....stormchaserrrrr\\". And \\"Aliens\\"? Don't get me started.<br /><br />It's like those session jazz guys on the cover of guitar magazines. These guys are so accomplished, but they didn't seem to get the memo about the demise of blown-out mullets and rainbow-colored cable knit sweaters! Meaning they reach a point where they lose sight of what it means to progress, both musically and otherwise. Just a parallel.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with prog fans in general is that their tastes don't really progress at all, after a certain juncture. I remember telling friends how much more progressive \\"90125\\" was vs. \\"Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman & Howe\\"' in terms of moving forward into innovative musical territory (unlike the back-pedaling OF ABW&H), and I got taken to the woodshed for that opinion, but I still stand by it.<br /><br />I can think of a dozen contemporary bands that are progressing into uncharted areas of rock music that make this album look (and smell) like a Lee Rittenour cabbage fart. And they aren't even \\"Prog\\".<br /><br />Prog has become a misnomer within the last 25 years, as far as I'm concerned. How can you progress and stagnate at the same time? Gabriel is one of the last of his generation that continues to strive for new frontiers. I guess that's why it takes him 8 years to make an album. Scott Walker, too. Although he was never a technically a prog artist, he certainly is more progressive than anything here, by a MILE.<br /><br />Worth a listen, just out of respect for two giants of their respective instruments, but if you're looking for creative and innovative  sounds in the rock world, there's little to mine in this quarry. It's been cleaned out.ou're looking for creative and innovative  sounds in the rock world, there's little to mine in this quarry. It's been cleaned out.

B006LSZECO|2.0|There is absolutely nothing likable about these characters.  The writer does a very good job describing two very shallow yet brilliant, beautiful people and their pathological relationship but it is hard to feel more than disgust and pity.<br />The set-up of the story is well-done, about the first 20% of the book.  Then it becomes tedious.  I almost couldn't read to the end.  Much better material out there.  You don't have to look very hard.

B005LAIHPY|1.0|What, am I the only one who paid attention to the story-line of this movie? Those who did pay attention may have noticed that the aliens in this movie never attacked the humans directly, always focusing on the machines used to attack them. In fact, throughout the whole movie, the aliens attack only after they were attacked first. Every time the aliens came in direct contact with the humans, they and their devices only scanned them and then changed course. At no time did the humans try to make contact with the aliens after they came to Earth. The only intent of the aliens that was confirmed by the humans was that the aliens were trying to communicate with their home planet. Although there were some interesting action sequences in this movie, the humans in this movie at no time acted in a heroic or noble manner, always being the aggressors. The only thing that I really enjoyed about the movie was the fact that the shells used in the battles by the aliens looked like the pegs from the game. My advice is to not waste your money on this movie, unless you intend to first check your brain at the door.

B007XWFZSA|4.0|This book will help you get in the state of mind required to do well on a case interview for a management consulting company. It teaches the right way of thinking, and explains WHY this is the right way. It does not only recommend frameworks, but details the thought-process that stands behind it.<br />The only con is that the author (who does a terrific job otherwise) tends to be somewhat tedious and sometimes repeats himself so many times that it becomes boring and borderline impossible to keep on reading.<br />I do recommend reading this book if you are serious about getting a job offer from a consulting company.

I have a very very low tolerance for blood, violence, or graphics.  This book was nothing like that, I had no trouble reading it.  Obviously, It had parts where people were killing each other but it didn't go into detail and hangout on those parts.  The point of the book was not to tell a killing story, but to show how a group of people can make a difference and fight for their society.  I love this book and bought/started catching fire as soon as I finished.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I think that the majority of the people claiming to be disappointed by this film are trying to hard to force it in to the Alien franchise, and/or had such a defined picture of what the movie was going to be in their minds that they couldn't help but be disappointed. No problem there for me; I didn't know what to expect and don't really care about the Alien series (though I do respect the ground that Ridley Scott broke with the first film). I am a huge Blade Runner fan though, and I think that this film is more in tune with that film than the aforementioned series. Gorgeous cinematography: unique and inventive shots one after another, edited with such style and lyricism, wonderful acting, etc. Prometheus is one of the greatest pieces of science fiction (perhaps art in general) ever conceived, and I think someday might be considered Scott's masterpiece. Only time will tell...

First of all, if you've ever seen a Steven Soderbergh movie you should be familiar with his \\"slow\\" pacing. He likes to try different things, and I appreciate that!<br /><br />The script is a predictable revenge story, but what action movie these days isn't? I'm not sure what these other reviewers were expecting. I liked Gina Carano - she was kickass! I think people just aren't used to a competant female action hero. What acting skills would you like to see? This isn't Shakespeare! If anything, I thought Bill Paxton gave the worst performance - if only because he had nothing to work with as the dad.

B0085A9J18|5.0|Writer/Director Gareth Evans learned his lesson from MERANTAU, his earlier collaboration with former truck driver and now budding martial arts star Iko Uwais. MERANTAU exhibited some first-rate martial arts mayhem but was crippled by Evans' meandering pace and flat explorations of the lead character's culture. In THE RAID: REDEMPTION (or \\"Serbuan maut\\") Evans sets us up with everything we need to know about premise and characters within the first five minutes. From then on, brother, it's best that you grab hold of something. Nerves will be jangled and eyes glued and behinds parked precariously on the edges of seats.<br /><br />Sub-text and this film go together like Merchant Ivory cinema and Uwe Boll. And yet, sometimes, there's something to be said for guerrilla filmmaking. THE RAID: REDEMPTION is strictly no frills, production values-wise. But Gareth Evans makes the most of his shoestring budget and minimalist plot. He turns the focus on the action sequences. You know how, in martial arts films, the plot merely serves as a framing device for the fighty fights? Here, the plot makes a cameo appearance and then gets the ef out of Dodge lest it catch a vicious Iko Uwais boot to the head.<br /><br />In the slums of Jakarta looms a squalid 30-story highrise, an apartment complex which the vile ganglord, Tama Rivadi, rents out to assassins, psychopaths, gangsters, and drvg traffickers. Tama's impenetrable sanctuary has long been regarded as a \\"no-go zone\\" for the police. Until today. Today an elite squad composed of twenty police officers has just gotten the go-ahead to infiltrate Tama's fortress and capture Tama himself. What are the odds they could do this on the Q?<br /><br />The squad manages to systematically secure only the first few bottom floors before the cat is let out the bag. From then on, it's an apocalyptic fight for survival. There's a twofer in this one: RAID: THE REDEMPTION is most recognizably a martial arts film, but there are elements of the survival horror genre peppered in. Tama Rivadi is quick to offer lifelong tenancy to them residents what take out the coppers.<br /><br />Get your raw thrills, get your jaw dropped. Gareth Evans and Iko Uwais have created something primal here, and credit Evans, too, for establishing an oppressive atmosphere. I would not want to be caught in that lethal tenement, with homicidal maniacs swarming up on me. THE RAID: REDEMPTION is an Indonesian film (with English sub-titles) and, as such, it gleefully showcases the nation's traditional martial arts discipline, Pencak Silat. What Evans constructs with the action sequences is stunning. He adeptly stages the tense gunplays. But when the ammo runs out and the firearms discarded, what's left is intense, close-quarters, I can smell your breath, hand-to-hand combat, and that's when the film achieves another level of excitement. Evans applies deft camera work to capture the speed, grace and brutality of Pencak Silat. Iko Uwais plays the unassuming rookie cop, Rama, who only wants to survive the mission and return to his pregnant wife. Uwais demonstrates a quiet appeal; he's certainly got more of an acting presence than Tony Jaa. And Iko Uwais in motion is something to behold. I'd put his electrifying marathon hallway fight and, later, his extended brawl with the machete gang against any other fight scenes captured on film. Uwais and Yayan Ruhian - who plays Tama's vicious lieutenant \\"Mad Dog\\" - choreographed the fights, and what they've come up with is UNREAL!<br /><br />And just when you think the film's action couldn't top itself, it does. I don't know if these fighty fights are that original or inventive, but, damn, they're executed with such verve and swagger and shot with such clarity that they deserve all the plaudits and hyperbole. The pulsating score only punctuates the electrifying symphony of violence. I won't go too much into my favorite kill, only that it involves the jagged remains of a door and that one baddie gets rudelyintroduced to that.<br /><br />The pace blisters. Even the quieter moments are laced with nervous anxiety. There's enough \\"acting\\" done that you do end up caring about certain characters and what befalls them. Ray Sahetapy nails it as the deliciously malevolent ganglord Tama. Joe Taslim lends solid presence as the experienced Sergeant Jaka, one of my favorite characters in the film. THE RAID: REDEMPTION won't escape comparisons to ONG BAK and DISTRICT B13, and that's fine. Moment for moment, in terms of relentless pace and sustained suspense, RAID is superior to those other two, especially ONG BAK. Is Tony Jaa still a hermit in the woods? Can he still handle a goon so that the poor bastard goes hurtling backwards on a trajectory across empty space and nearly cracks in half against a lower railing? Iko Uwais just did that.<br /><br />Ear to the ground news is that there's already a sequel in the works. I'm not sure how Iko Uwais plans to top this film without setting himself on fire. Niche market, my butt. Even the more sophisticated crowds owe it to themselves to see this one. After all, THE RAID: REDEMPTION is an independent foreign movie. It's practically Merchant Ivory.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff (with English sub-titles):<br /><br />- Audio Commentary with writer/director Gareth Evans<br />- 6 Video Blogs: includes the cast undergoing military bootcamp, the cast rehearsing their fight choreography, behind the scenes of Rama's fight with the machete gang, Sgt.

B004G6TD4S|5.0|I have this album on vinyl, but wanted the convenience of a CD format. The product arrived in a timely fashion and in excellent condition. I have enjoyed listening to \\"Trilogy\\" in my car!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|\\"You sank my BATTLESHIP!!\\" is what each suit at Universal Studios is yelling at the cast and crew. While the film had better success overseas and even though it's on the verge of tallying a global sum of over 300 million, I guess it's all about how it performs domestically. In part you have to factor in that THE AVENGERS ate up much of the box office gross. In part you have to look at the flaws within BATTLESHIP because, to drop some sea slang, not all the hatches were battened down.<br /><br />BATTLESHIP is this generation's INDEPENDENCE DAY, except that Taylor Kitsch doesn't come near to matching Will Smith's palpable cool and charisma. Taylor Kitsch, more accurately, strives to Tom Cruise his way thru the movie, except that he also doesn't generate Cruise's swagger. On the other hand, Kitsch does make for a perfectly serviceable lead hero.<br /><br />***PLOT SPOILERS from now on***<br /><br />He plays 26-year-old slacker Alex Hopper, and Alex is an epic screw-up. His latest scrape - breaking into a convenience store to present a fine chick (Brooklyn Decker) with a chicken burrito she'd been craving - results in his arrest and his fed-up naval officer bro (Alexander Skarsgard) issuing an ultimatum: enlist in the U.S. Navy or dot dot dot...<br /><br />But before all that, BATTLESHIP actually opens up with yet one more exploration into hubris, as we're made privy to the Beacon Project, a deep space endeavor which hinges on our scientists' transmitting a constant signal to a newly discovered and possibly habitable planet somewhere in the far reaches of the universe.<br /><br />In the Navy, some years later, Alex Hopper has found a home, has found a girl (in fact, the same girl, hot burrito babe). He's ascended to the rank of Lieutenant and is the Tactical Action Officer on the destroyer, the John Paul Jones. Only, the screw-up is never too far from the surface, and Hopper finds the most inopportune time to bollocks it all up. He is madly in love with the burrito girl - okay, her name is Samantha - and he intends to ask her father's permission to marry her, never mind that Sam is the daughter of the very intimidating fleet admiral (Liam Neeson). Except that Hopper falls back to bad habits. It starts when Hopper and Sam wake up late for a naval ceremony on board the 70-year-old museum relic, the U.S.S. Missouri. From there, for Hopper, it downspirals.<br /><br />The U.S. fleet is currently undergoing naval exercises several miles off Oahu, a joint venture which includes the Japanese Navy, and I think this very convenient happenstance pops up just so Hopper can spark a heated rivalry against a brash Japanese officer (Tadanobu Asano) and bring about Hopper's career-ending snafu. Hopper's most recent conduct unbecoming is the final straw; he's informed that when his ship pulls into port, he'll be drummed out of the service.<br /><br />So, thank goodness for the alien attack.<br /><br />If you're that one person who'd been clamoring for a film adaptation of Hasbro's great game of strategy, my friend, this is your moment. You, more than most, will likely appreciate the film's nods to the classic board game, from giant exploding pegs to the mimicry of the board game itself, thanks to a sneaky strategy that calls for a plot chart superimposed on a grid of weather buoys. I was surprised at how much I got into it during that combat sequence.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars for BATTLESHIP, and I didn't think I'd be that generous. You know what you're walking into: a summer blockbuster that is mindless but fun, garish but visually flawless. It's commercially calculated. The dialogue is by the numbers. There's perfunctory attention given to character development. I mean, check out Hopper's sweeping trajectory: our lead guy goes from a B & E at a convenience store to suddenly commanding his own vessel.<br /><br />Hopper doesn't have time to contemplate his recent knucklehead blunders. Four alien spacecrafts have just plummeted into the Pacificwaters. An impenetrable bubble barrier 300,000 feet in altitude and 2 nautical miles deep has just surrounded and isolated three destroyers from the naval exercises. I think that was Tokyo that was crapp'd on just now. Hopper, Petty Officer Cora 'Weps' Raikes (Rihanna), and some expendable red shirt approach one alien ship. And is it just me or were the alien ships pretty passive until the humans started messing about? Anyway, Hopper's little scouting party causes the alien craft to launch hellacious ordinance on the destroyers. And before you can say \\"bonehead boo-boo,\\" massive casualties and the time-honored chain of command have left Hopper as senior officer onboard the John Paul Jones. This doesn't instill much confidence in what's left of his crew.<br /><br />The acting won't bowl you over. Liam Neeson sleepwalks thru his role. But I thought Rihanna's stunt casting actually worked out okay. And real-life war veteran and double amputee Gregory D. Gadson, as the recovering, tough-as-nails Lt. Colonel Mick Canales, exudes a solid presence. That doesn't imply that I savored his scenes with Brooklyn Decker and Hamish Linklater (who takes on the requisite nerd scientist Jeff Goldblum role). It feels to me like the film wanted to retain the eye candy factor and was looking for a plot thread to feature Decker. She, Gadson, and Linklater get tapped with having to take out the Oahu-based satellite substation before the alien ships can signal for reinforcements.<br /><br />I liked BATTLESHIP, despite its plot holes wide enough for a naval fleet to steer thru. It met my expectations (which weren't very high), and even exceeded them in certain areas (for one thing, it's funnier than I thought it would be). In my opinion, director Peter Berg makes his film more charming and likable than Michael Bay's 'bots in disguise franchise. Half an hour into it, I found myself onboard with the ridiculous shenanigans. I thought the aliens came off meaner than the Chitauri (this is a good thing). And, it turns out, one cheesy moment doubles as a neat moment when, late in the game, Hopper gets unexpected support in the shape of a crew of old timers. Cue the Mighty Mo, and cue the ACDC track. I think Peter Berg should take on Scrabble next. Or Boggle. Or Hungry Hungry Hippos.<br /><br />If you care about that sort of stuff, stick around for the post-credits scene.waters.

0345803485|1.0|I had to read this book for the bookclub that I'm in and finding that this book was on the top of the bookseller's list was looking forward to doing so...<br />What a bunch of complete and utter nonsense this book is:<br />How old is the writer? 16?<br />Really? a billionaire that has time to have almost constantly sex and e-mailing his girlfriend? Doesn't he have to work?<br />Perhaps I can try biting my lip to see what effect that has on men - erotic? - I think not! - Stupid -> definitely !<br />I'm only in the middle of the book, but if they don't stop having stupid sex I will have to quit reading this, I won't however have anything to laugh with.....I keep on thinking: why am I reading this.......<br />And a book like this goes to #1? - Congratulations to the person doing the marketing!
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is a loved classic and I was sceptical about buying used. I must admit though that the movie was in excellent condition. I am very pleased; not only with its condition but prompt shipping.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Having read the book that this was based on, I wasn't sure what to expect.  This was one of the very few times that the series was way better than the book.  (which I enjoyed).  The characters were fantastic, and loved the different story lines of the characters.  How they interpreted their flash forwards and how that affected their decisions going forward.  There's lots of surprises and  action in this series, but it also makes you think.  Really enjoyed this one and am pretty surprised that it didn't make it to season 2.  While there's a bit of a cliff hanger, there's closure for some of the storylines, so thought it was worth watching - even knowing I wouldn't see the end of the series.<br /><br />Definitely worth the time,  and you're likely to get hooked.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|&#34;GoodFellas,&#34; is having its 25th anniversary this year. It was the first film to give us an inside look into the life of the Mafia. A few years later along came the celebrated 'Sopranos' which was the quintessential Mafia story.<br /><br />However, Martin Scorcese brought Goodfellas to life.  It came from a book by Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the story of Henry Hill. This film's Henry Hill is played brilliantly by Ray Liotta. He also narrates most of the film. He came up with the ambition to be a wise guy,and he skipped school and worked his way up. Once Henry becomes a man he meets the woman of his dreams, Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco. She went on to become the psychiatrist to Tony Soprano. Karen married Henry and found the wife of a Mafioso was one of loneliness and no one outside of the group. They party together, go to each other's weddings, baby showers, vacation together, and that is their life. She became part of the crowd and it took her a long time to realize exactly what kind of life she was in.<br /><br />We meet all of the group, Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, Jimmy, played by Robert De Niro, Tommy, played by Joe Pesci. A strange and very dangerous group, and Henry finally becomes disillusioned with this group. He stuck it out,but it was not in his blood, any longer. The stories, the crimes, the characters all become one of this film. It is a film that sticks with you, the violence is brutal, the characters all flawed. The police paid off, the families had the best the men could steal. It is at once a violent film, but one of the best films of the past 25 years. In this 25th anniversary, watch it again, it only gets better.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 04-29-15

B00433SVP6|4.0|I have enjoyed both reading and listening to the Percy Jackson stories, and this book continues those exciting and chaotic adventures.<br /><br />Easy reading for adults who might want to keep up with what the teens and pre-teens in their life might be reading or those just looking for a light diversion from the usual adult content. I likewise think the kids who are its intended audience will find it equally entertaining, and it could make a nice modern manner tie-in for those who might be completing assignments on ancient Rome's religious beliefs and deities.<br /><br />I think the book makes for an interesting mix of the usual early teen social and cultural challenges, blended in an engaging way with the ancient history of Rome. I often find myself stepping out of the book to look up a little piece of ancient myth trivia which i hadn't known before.<br /><br />An easy, entertaining read - 3 and half stars
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This is my first book by Scalzi, but it won't be my last. I love Star Trek, and I love action-adventure stories with a healthy dose of humor. Redshirts is more a humorous story with a healthy dose of action-adventure, but I'm alright with that, too. If you've seen Galaxy Quest, this is not terribly new ground. It's a simultaneous send-up and homage to Star Trek specifically and sci-fi television in general.<br /><br />It's a clever premise: what would happen if a few of those doomed ensigns actually compared notes and realized their life expectancy on away missions was nil? Redshirts reminds me of the movie \\"Cabin in the Woods,\\" seeking to explain the sometimes galactically-stupid behavior of characters in genre fiction. Only instead of explaining why coeds always think splitting up is a great idea when you're being attacked by redneck zombies, Redshirts ponders why well-armed ensigns who were theoretically the security detail on away missions always ended up dead.<br /><br />My favorite elements were the dialogue and humor. The action sequences were clear and fast paced; it always annoys me when action scenes are bogged down with too much detail--that wasn't a problem here. Similarly, I appreciate a science fiction novel that understands taking science seriously doesn't mean turning a novel into a doctoral thesis on physics, or a technical manual so detailed you could use it to manufacture the starship where it's set.<br /><br />No major complaints with this book. It was a thoroughly enjoyable read start to finish.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Did not enjoy. The writer uses the same words over and over again and outdated expressions such as \\"Holy cow!\\" The main character didn't have any personality or wit. My rage at the writing and characters dulled the intimate scenes. I would not recommend to read.
0345803485|5.0|When I read in the newspaper the consideration to ban Fifty Shades of Gray from the library I had to have the book.  The book arrived as describe and promptly. Thank you.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Haywire gets a bad rap because the trailer gives an impression that we'll be served a heavy action film. That's not the case. Haywire focuses much more on suspense and has an indie style feel to it. Expect long lulls between the few action sequences this film provides. The only exciting fight scene was the hotel room brawl. That alone was worth the price of admission. It was one of the best theatrical fight scenes to come along in years. But then you have the Barcelona fight which consisted of a drawn out footchase followed by a few seconds of grappling. Carano is inexplicably given less credit than she deserves. She did alright acting wise. There were just a couple of times when her \\"don't mess with me\\" stare resembled a \\"what's that smell?\\" look. There's a fine line between the two. I look forward to more movies starring Gina Carano. It's nice to see an action star do their own stunts for a change.

B005S9EJ14|2.0|I watched \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" in a theater full of senior citizens and, as we were exiting the theater, I heard approximately two of them saying that they had actually enjoyed the movie.  That's understandable.  While \\"Marigold Hotel\\" is, for all practical purposes,  a movie of, by and for senior citizens, its appeal may fall short of expectations.<br /><br />The story is simple.  A group of English retirees answer the call to spend their golden years in affordable luxury at the titular hotel in India.  After flight cancellations force the group to catch a bus and tuk-tuks (three-wheeled auto rickshaws) to their destination, they are disappointed to find that the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a rundown mess, a ruin of its former glory (or perhaps not).  Many mishaps ensue as the Brits try and make the best of the situation and not run back to England with their collective tails between their legs.  The movie, a comedy-drama has tons of potential and should have been so much better, but director John Madden (\\"Shakespeare in Love\\", \\"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\\") has fashioned an old fashioned movie with so little humor or drama that the movie is rendered lifeless.<br /><br />The elite cast that Madden has assembled could perform the roles of these stereotypical characters in their sleep.  There's a recently widowed woman who has never done a thing on her own (Judi Dench); a browbeaten husband and his nagging scold of a wife (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton); a desperately flirtatious golddigger of a certain age (Celia Imrie); a gay judge suffering tremendous guilt over events in the past (Tom Wilkinson); a fun-loving tomcat ready to pounce on any woman who'll say yes (Ronald Pickup); and, of course, Maggie Smith as a sour-faced ex-housekeeper (as opposed to her usual role as a sour-faced aristocrat).  The situations the actors are thrown into are telegraphed far in advance, and there are absolutely no surprises.  We already surmise that one of the characters will not make it to the end of the movie, and it's an egregious irritant that director Madden reaches back to film mores of the fifties to ensure that it's the \\"right\\" character who dies.<br /><br />Other than Celia Imrie, and a lovely turn by Diana Hardcastle (as randy Pickup's understanding conquest), I think the Indian actors come off best.  \\"Slumdog Millionaire's\\" Dev Patel is delightful as young Sonny, the inexperienced and cash-poor proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (which he inherited from his equally inexperienced and inept father).  Sonny's efforts to keep the hotel afloat and his genuine concern for his residents shine through in Patel's radiant performance.  Tena Desae, as Sonny's girlfriend, a call-center operator, also amuses and does her best to keep her character afloat in an overpopulated dead sea of clichés.<br /><br />Ben Davis' cinematography wonderfully captures the many hues and the whirling dervish continuity of life, which makes this film all the more disappointing.  With all this life bursting at the seams, \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" feels dead on arrival.
B007SSDS24|4.0|Finally. A solid science fiction thriller that is not a' re-make. It is a *new* film, based on an excellent original story and script.    Artistically filmed using intriguing Moscow locations with good pacing throughout.    Science fiction films do not require massive special effects. The effects here are distinctive and effectively highlight the story.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I've been using this headset for a few weeks now, and my experiences are a bit of a mixed bag. I'm not a big fan of Logitech's products, and was weary about all the negative feedback I saw on this product in particular, but it seemed like a good value for a wireless headset.    The good:  -Surround sound and overall sound quality are pretty good  -The around-ear headphones dampen most outside sounds, while not completely deafening you to your surroundings  -Battery life averages 6-8 hours  -Wireless connection is excellent    The bad:  All of these issues emerged after 2-3 weeks of use.  -significant response lag when using the side volume wheel (I adjust the volume, but it can take 5-10 seconds to actually change volume)  -Slight buzzing noise (as reported by many others) when near max volume. For me, this isn't much of an issue, as I see little reason to have the volume this high in the first place, but it's worth mentioning.  -Odd behavior with low battery life when on the charger: Basically after being on the charger all day, it sometimes (inconsistently) begins a loud buzzing/siren sound, and then shuts off after 20-30 seconds, as if it died. It must be left off for several minutes before it will turn on normally again, at which point it shows a full charge. Additionally, the sound volume can randomly cut out, to the point where you have to be at max volume to hear at the same level as say, 25% volume.  -Surround sound no longer seems to function at all (I have not yet attempted to fix this, it's probably just driver issues)    All in all, it's not that bad of a headset, though it's worth noting that it is my first wireless one. The technical issues seem fairly severe, and make the set seem a little shoddy. If you've had good experiences with logitech, this might be a reasonable purchase, but otherwise I'd recommend researching some other options.    EDIT:  I wrote this review about two years ago. I'd like to add some information about my experiences.  First, Ihave used 3 of these so far. The charging port is VERY fragile and poorly connected. If you begin losing sound in the right side, it is a loose mini-usb port. If you have the tools and the steady hand, you can repair it yourself. I bought a second headset which also broke (both after 1 year of use) and the third was a warranty return.   Second, if you have a spare wall outlet, prefer to charge from there. The PC charging tends to only prolong the inevitable battery drainage.   Third, don't wear it while plugged in unless you must. The charge port will last much longer this way.    I still love this headset, but it's important to be aware of the potential faults, otherwise you may find yourself ordering one of these yearly.

After having watching Saving Private Ryan I realized how poorly done this movie was.  Rogue Pilots, a nearly bullet proof fighter squadron, overly used CGI, unconvincing dialogue.  Honestly WW2 was a dark time.

B005LAIGP0|2.0|Lots of sluggish background noise.  Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent on a mission to a foreign village (The Causeway to Osea Island, Maldon, Essex, England.) Never mind that it is the same scene from Dracula when they toss John Harker to the vamps. The screen writer was thinking more of the apocalypse now mission. He is to wrap-up the paperwork of a deceased client of the firm. Little did he know that he was going to suffer (along with us) a series of \\"things that go bump in the night?\\" and Lots of sluggish background noise.

B005LAIGPU|2.0|Many people watch superpower hero movies. Quite a few have read the comic books behind most of them. And of course speculate as to what it would be like if you had the powers.<br /><br />Put on a towel and jump off the roof. It is much more thrilling than this movie. I suppose it's a popular gimmick nowadays but \\"Blair Witch\\" movies don't thrill me. If you enjoy this type of presentation then definitely watch the movie \\"Apollo 18\\" it is just as hokey.<br /><br />Three teens (Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan) fall in a hole. It is too bad they did not stay there. Of course if they had we wouldn't have much of a movie I guess, such that it is. Then came the proverbial powers. It's not so bad watching them have to struggle with their newfound abilities; but having to watch it on a phony homemade movie genre is more than one can take. You can guess the outcome before it starts; so you better enjoy this people throwing objects around and throwing more objects around and throwing more objects around until they run at objects that are around.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not even novel redundant smut. Read \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover' if you want true erotica. At least there is a plot beyond the playroom and biting or not biting a lower lip. I won't be completing this trilogy. I think I already know how it will end. BORING! What amazes me is how far our culture has come. A hundred years ago, women championed being submissive. Forty years ago, when men and women learned how to enjoy each other exchanging the role of dominant and submissive. And when  couples learned that sharing each other's expectations and values came prior to sexual intimacy, not afterward. And  even now, news flash! Couples who lived through the sexual revolution of the 60's are becoming elderly and finding out that there is much more to life than sex! There has to be a better way to spend time and money than this teenaged trash!  I have to wonder who they will choose to play the role in the movie version and just how explicit Hollyweird will take this 'fine literature' when it gets filmed. Let's put it this way--if this book or the sequels get nominated for a Pulitzer or an Academy Award, I might throw up.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|I used this for a new i7-3770 system and was happy to see how easy the installation was.  The Blu-ray and DVD drives and hard disks just snap in.  The two fans are quiet.  This is the quietest system I have built.  Part of the reason I chose the One is lighter weight, 10 lbs vs. 25 lbs. for my previous Antec case.  The side panels are thinner but it's not a problem and it was much easier to work with.<br /><br />Update 6/4/2018:  Be sure you get a right angle SATA cable for any 3.5\\" drives.  Using a straight (180 degree) SATA cable I broke the drive connectors putting the side panel on.  The straight connector just stuck out too far.  2.5\\" drives (like my SSD) are no problem with straight connectors.<br /><br />btw, Antec has a slick no screws mounting scheme for 3.5\\" drives.  You just place two pins of the mounting slider in the screw holes of the drive, slide it in, and it clicks into place.  As I've used the system about a year now I find the light weight much easier to deal with and there is no problem with durability for any normal use.
B007V80WUC|5.0|I was impressed with CM when I heard their first CD. I knew I had found an amazing band of extremely talented players and composers. They have continued to mature in their style and direction. Although \\"Isolate\\" was very good, I struggled a bit with the production of the music. But I have been enjoying \\"Nine\\" very much. The songs are strong, as are the individual and collective talents of the players. Mike's voice is unique and emotional. You can follow a band like Norway's Circus Maximus from their start and realize, without a doubt, that they are destined for greatness. I would recommend \\"Nine\\" to anyone who enjoys this genre of music. I will not compare them to anyone, though their influences are truly defined and well documented. It leaves me to wonder if their next release will be different than this. If it is as good as this one, I will welcome anything they come up with. CM is a band that does not disappoint their fans. I wish them all the best and hope many music lovers will buy their CDs and attend their shows, so they become as well known as bands like Symphony X, Dream Theater, etc. They deserve it as well. So.... you can tell I am thrilled about what they are doing.<br />Stu Barnhart

0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey is the funniest woman for the last couple of years. Reading her book I had to laugh out loud more than once. Highly recommended!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I found this book simply and clearly written.  The truth of it just shone through and by the end of it I was filled with a sense of peace.  If you want a profound read that is easy to absorb and just quietly gets into your consciousness this is it. Somehow Anita Moorjani manages to convey the reality of what happened to her even though it may seem like an 'unreal' event. I loved the way the book cuts through issues like opposing religious beliefs and gives us such an effortless alternative. To just be ourselves and honour joy of life, others and ourselves in a non-judgemental way. You will be touched by this book and it will give you peace I am sure of it.

B007Z9R69M|2.0|The good: very nice fight sequences.<br />The bad: very POOR storyline and REALLY SLOW between fights.<br />The ugly: I wasted both my time (which I can never get back) & my $!<br />The rest: This was a recommendation for me and boy did they miss the mark!, simply put it was just plan BORING.  If you desire to see a much better female spy movie get Salt, it's at least 10 times better.  The ONLY reason it gets 2 **s is for the fight scenes, otherwise it would be -1 star.  I would NOT recommend this movie.<br /><br />Link to \\"Salt\\" http://www.amazon.com/Salt/dp/B004BEMC6G/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1339877445&sr=8-5&keywords=salt.

B000A2W1X2|5.0|Several years ago I saw this movie on a cable television channel and thought it was wonderful.  I cried throughout movie.  It took me a long time to find a VHR copy and when I did it was expensive.  I could never find on DVD.  Recently, I came across the VHR copy and decided to try again to find a DVD copy....finally, I found on Amazon a Region 3 International copy (good quality) at reasonable price for a brand new, never viewed copy...yea!<br /><br />I received it earlier then promised when ordered and watched it last night.....it is still a wonderful story about longing and a deep love between the characters. The couple Elisabeth and Charles find the magic of Firelight brings them together and the seven-year old daughter Louisa finds the joy of finally having a mother in her life (what a little brat she is throughout movie, until her discovery). It had an ending with the three of them starting a new life together...wish there was a sequel to find out more.  The actors Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane and Dominique Delacourt were the right ones chosen for the parts. If you are a romantic at heart or just enjoy a good movie, you would enjoy Firelight.  The beautiful,haunting musical score by Christopher Gunning is available on CD ( I bought one a long time ago and play it often...also ordered from Amazon) Enjoy the movie and keep some tissues handy!
B003UESJJC|5.0|I'll start this review off by stating:  'I hate war movies.'  But I'll also admit, I can readily appreciate when a war movie is great.  Saving Private Ryan was an awesome movie, saw it about 4 times in theaters.  This movie, I didn't have high hopes for - but damn was I glad I was wrong.<br />First off, the directing style was insane.  Some of the shots in this movie were epic in themselves.  I have seen a lot of movies and a lot of very good and great cinematic sequences - This movie had scene after scene of just great imagery - I could hardly believe what I was seeing, sober!<br />The way it progressed through Sheen's readings of Brando's classified documents made it transition very well.  The greatest thing, to me, was how the further they got into the heart of the darkness, the more corrupt and 'disfunctioned' things became.  There were no CO's and things just fell apart, much like the boat crew.  And the way this 'falling apart' was portrayed, perfect.<br />A great thing was, it wasn't overly grotesque - this whole movie wasn't nearly as graphic as the first twenty minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and yet you were left with the mental filth of how harsh war could actually become and really pits you into what it does to your mind.<br />I'll say it again:  I hate war movies.  This movie has become one of my favorites, hands down.  I sat on the edge of my couch for an hour and a half, engrossed by the way the movie transitioned.<br />The only negative, to me, was the encounter with the French plantation.  It seemed out of place but at the same time held a significance.  It also made me think that these scenes are a great 'WTF is going on' moment.  Just running into these French 'settlers' in the middle of an Asian country / confrontation added to how top notch the movie is.<br />I thought the hype over this movie was BS, but its not.  This movie is great, all around.  Makes me regret not seeing it in re-release theaters.<br />I have a very strict top 10 movies onmy list - Apocalypse Now could easily slip into my top five.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you have a mind to, grab your copy of \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and a highlighter. Go through it carefully highlighting the words \\"mutter\\" and \\"murmur\\". Pretty soon, it starts to look like the Yellow Pages. It is amazing how the two main characters manage to communicate with each other, given their less than enunciated speech.<br />Take it a step further. Get the book on CD, or put it on your iPod, somewhere where you can listen to it privately. Get 3 types of hard liquor, Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, Patron Silver, Absolut, rotgut whiskey. Whatever. Your tipples of choice. Set up 3 rows of 6 shot glasses, each row filled with a different alcoholic beverage. Start listening to \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\". Do a shot of ETOH beverage #1 each time you hear the word \\"murmur\\", a shot of beverage #2 when you hear the word \\"mutter\\", and a shot of #3 when you hear the word \\"gaze\\". I predict you will have passes out before you are halfway through chapter 1.<br />If you choose to continue this activity beyond chapter 1, make sure you have made a will and have all your affairs in order.<br />A kind act would be to allow funds to furnish E. L. James with a good thesaurus.
0393342212|5.0|I read the first book years ago but this revised one, in my opinion, is even better!  As a therapist, I have already recommended it to several parents of children I work with.  The book is an easy read and has so much information that is useful!
0811879542|5.0|Un Livre is French for Press This, the name of today's book for review.  Here is what the publisher say, on their web page, about Press This: Press the yellow dot on the cover of this book, follow the instructions within, and embark upon a magical journey! Each page of this surprising book instructs the reader to press the dots, shake the page, tilt the book, and who knows what will happen next! Children and adults alike will delight as the  dots multiply, change direction, and grow in size! Especially remarkable because the adventure occurs on the flat surface of the simple, printed page, this unique picture book about the power of imagination and interactivity will provide read-aloud fun for all ages!<br /><br />Press This was originally published in France in 2010.  This is an old-fashioned interactive book: no bells or whistles, taped voices, fancy apps, or CDs included.  I would not expect a movie to be produced, though one can never tell. Press This encourages children to touch the page and wonder what will happen when the page is turned.<br /><br />Children are encouraged to press this, clap hands, blow, rub, tilt, and shake then turn the page to find out what happened to the dot(s) after they pressed, clapped, blew, tilted, or shook the page.  Press This is a laughter machine and addictive.  Each page tells the reader what to do next.<br /><br />Pres here and turn the page.<br />Great! Now press the yellow dot again.<br />Now tilt the page to the left . . . just to see what happens.<br /><br />What happens is, your child looks in wonder and then laughs. Most likely you will then laugh.  Kids will love watching the dot seemingly move and change color or position as they turn the thick, shiny paper.  Where is the story?  The story is the yellow dot's journey through the pages as your child interacts with the book.  Children need to touch the book; jungle and wiggle the book; shake, rub, and tap the book to move along the yellow dot's journey.  That's it. That is the story of Press This.<br /><br />Sound odd?  Yes.  Sort of Stupid?  Yeah, kind of.  Briliant?  Absolutely!<br /><br />Press This is a tactile stimulation book and just as amazing as pop-up books, neither of which can happen on an iPad.  Your child will learn right from left, up from down, colors, turn on and turn off, and the joy of magic, which is what happens every time your child follows the directions, turns the thick, shiny paper and imagines she did whatever the dot(s) did from the present to the next page.  The cover is made of thick cardboard, making this book sturdy and able to weather repeat readings.  And Press This is addictive.<br /><br />When the last page reads, Want to do it all over again?  More likely than not, you will hear a resounding \\"YES!\\"is the story of Press This.<br /><br />Sound odd?  Yes.  Sort of Stupid?  Yeah, kind of.  Briliant?

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is AMAZING,  but it would be much better if I could buy the temple run brave edition on the kindle fire. If you can do this, I would rate another five stars. I would really appriciate it if you can do this. And if other people are reading this, please ask for the temple run brave edition in your rating.  Thank you if you can please do this.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I couldn't finish it. It was so terribly written. Oh crap! Double crap!  Was it the author's intention to make the reader want to stab the main character (and her \\"inner goddess\\")? The one positive point was that I was able to get my money back.

1936608898|5.0|I was one of those people who looked healthy but on the inside I was miserable. I appeared thin and fit, but in reality I was constantly running to the bathroom and just steps away from type 2 diabetes. Three weeks on the diet that Dallas and Melissa promote changed my life. It will change yours too. In fact, it changed my life so dramatically that I am now dedicating my professional life to evangelizing this nutrient-dense way of eating and helping other people recover from a life on the Standard American Diet (SAD).<br /><br />It Starts with Food is written in a friendly, non judgmental yet firm tone. They're not saying a food is \\"off limits\\" but teaching you how to make better choices. \\"There is not guilt with food, just consequences\\" according to Melissa and Dallas. They're not saying you \\"can't\\" eat certain foods on special occasions, like drinking some wine at a friend's wedding. What they're saying is that food will either make you \\"more healthy or less healthy\\". They very clearly explain how your body's hormones work in response to food in a healthy and unhealthy situation. Their science is solid. You can dive into it and understand more than most doctors about human nutrient metabolism, or you can skip to chapter 8 where they dive into which foods are optimal for our bodies.<br /><br />In the \\"Meal Map\\" section at the end of the book, I really enjoyed how they chart out master recipes to \\"teach\\" you HOW to cook instead of lengthy complicated recipes. Essentially, the paleo diet is extremely simple. There are some great paleo recipe books out there, but what Melissa and Dallas are trying to do is to give you the tools to figure out how to cook what you have in your fridge, which is how we naturally should be cooking. Basically, you take some animal protein, add vegetables, good fats and some seasonings and there you have it. I also like how they break down breakfast lunch and dinner into \\"Meals 1, 2 & 3\\". I see a lot of people new to this diet who can't get past breakfast. Who says breakfast has to be cereal and bagels, or eggs all of the time? The \\"Master Recipes\\" give you a great foundation to build on.<br /><br />One small criticism I would make is their suggestion that vegetarians/vegans eat edamame and tofu for protein sources. Their suggestion to consume fermented soy and properly prepared legumes like lentils is much safer in my opinion.<br /><br />It Starts with Food is a total and complete roadmap to changing your life. It will give you all of the tools you need to make smarter decisions about your nutrition. I will absolutely recommend it to all of my clients as a must read.past breakfast.

B007PS0X0W|3.0|Not as entertaining as the first ones were. The writers are evidently getting tired of coming up with new ideas for this series.
B002I9Z8G2|4.0|That would be me. DS9 is probably my favorite version of the show, and I liked Voyager (mainly because of Jeri Ryan), too. And this, my friends, in my opinion- is the best of the Trek movies. And, on BluRay, it's wonderful effects and action sequences are even more stunning.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I have always loved Emily Bronte & Charlotte Bronte, but had never before ventured to read any novel by Jane Austin.  I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised!  This book reminded me very much of some of my favorite classic novels.  Two thumbs WAY up!!!

B0013O123Q|1.0|Disturbing not just for the pointless violence, but disturbing that there are people running around, unrestrained, that would even consider making a movie like this. Ridiculous spinning around and round with the camera....for what? Pointless violence and profanity...like a junior high school dropout made this \\"movie\\". \\"Selling\\" this piece of crap with this beautiful and sexy actress and promising graphic sex...should be against the law.<br />If this depicts something that actually goes on in the world, why glorify it by making a \\"movie\\" about it? Leave it in the gutter where it belongs, please. Absolutely no socially redeeming qualities at all here.

1936608898|5.0|I've been following Dallas and Melissa Hartwigs' Whole9 blog for some time now, have had the privilege of meeting them on a couple of occasions, and have recently finished their book \\"It Starts with Food.\\"  On all accounts, these two individuals have exceeded my expectations.  Every time.<br /><br />I've had a passion for food and exercise but it has been surely refined, tweaked, and is constantly evolving thanks to the Hartwigs.  Here's a top 5 list of why their book is awesome and why everyone should read it:<br /><br />1. It will save, improve, or positively change your life.  If not yours (which I highly doubt), then the friend you give the book to, or the friend of your friend that he/she told to read the book.  Being in the medical field, I see gangrenous toes, below knee amputations, diabetes crises, falls, heart attacks galore, strokes, depression, headaches, autoimmune diseases, obesity, etc.  So much of what I see could have probably been prevented, or at the very least, minimized, if my patients were more aware of the impact that food, sleep, stress, lifestyle, etc. all have on overall health.  It is saddening sometimes to think about how unaware and unaccountable we have become to our own health.  Work, school, family, activities, etc. - you can't even participate in them if you aren't healthy enough.  Don't wait until it's too late, or think you can make changes later.  Do it now.  Okay enough of that, now on to the fun stuff...<br /><br />2. All levels can read, understand, and take away from this book.  There is science lingo for those of us who want that, analogies for those of us who need that, and pictures for those of us who like visuals.  There are enough parallels that this can be read at different levels.  So no, your high school son is not too young to read this.  And no, you don't have to love science, food, or Paleo-anything to understand this.  And yes, you should give it to your personal trainer, doctor/PA/NP, friend, sister, boss, etc.<br /><br />3. The information in it is presented in such a way that one cannot argue with it.  The Hartwigs aren't making ridiculous requests or claims.  They're presenting their beliefs and the information that drives them to have these beliefs.  Then the reader decides what to do with that.  However, as a reader it is very hard to ignore the information presented because it is done so well.  I think even my most opposed colleagues would find it difficult to debate these issues with how they are presented.<br /><br />4. Even if you are already familiar with this lifestyle, you will take away from this book.  I promise.  I shouldn't need to explain this.  If you are unfamiliar with this lifestyle, you will take away from this too, don't worry.<br /><br />5. There are jokes in it.  Well, I think they are jokes at least.  Either way, it has some pretty funny, tough-loving, \\"how-did-they-know-I-was-thinking that?\\" type of lines.<br /><br />Bottom line - this book will become my point of reference for many, many friends, patients, and family members to start their journeys on better health.  I am so proud of Melissa and Dallas and I know we can expect greatness from them for many years to come! A job fantastically done!/><br />3.

1933952806|5.0|Author helps set up your D7000 and goes through all of the camera's functions.  He usually gives his own choices and recommendations which really helps when you don't know which mode or setup would suit your purpose best.  This alone makes it unique but the images and clear explanations far surpass those of the owners manual.  Also, the quality of the paper its printed on is top notch.  Well worth the price if you want to become more familiar with your D7000 and get a professional's advice on set up and how he uses it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does what they say with no hiccups. My kids have used it for their homework and I've used for things around the house. it is simple and easy to use.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This is such a great Bio-Doc on Harrison! Everyone will enjoy this as it has tons of old never seen before footage and stills.<br />Scorcese has done a masterful job of getting great interviews and the editing makes you not ever want to stop watching till its over and then watch it again.<br />Its one of the best if not the best piece on any music or movie star I've ever seen.<br />Can't recommend it enough!
B000VXJYFI|5.0|This has the feel of something coming together. Not quite in full flow-not the signature support of the Experience but more collaborative. The first two tracks 'Who Knows' and 'Machine Gun' are the tightest, moodiest combinations particularly the snarling of guitar on 'Machine Gun' with the explosive drumming. Buddy Miles and Billy Cox with Hendrix has to be a winner. The Hendrix tracks work the better. 'Changes' and 'We Gotta Live Together' don't atand out. As vinyl, it was thrashed, side one good for kicking out the dust and enjoying the ride of flashes of Jimi Hendrix at his best.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I can't believe that such a poorly written book is so popular. I only read this far because it was recommended highly and I blindly bought all three books. What a mistake. The sex scenes get tiring. The characters are flat. This author uses the same phrases (mutter, mumble, oh my) over and over again. She doesn't know the meaning of the word mumble or mutter. Ugh. Waste of money and time. It is sad that this is rated so highly. There is so many struggling but deserving authors out there ... James is not one of them.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|I have to admit, although I like Bob Dylan, I don't worship the ground he walks on. My first Dylan album, 'Highway 61 Revisited' was always one to play. More snarlin' Bob. Then there was the laid back jams of 'Fat Garrett and Billy the Pig'.And somehow 'Nashville Skyline' snuck in. Then a whole raft of seventies Bob, well crafted story songs on albums like 'Tangled up in Blue' and 'Desire'-troubador Bob on the road coming to a place near you, even if was an aircraft hanger called Earls Court circa 1978. But then Bob found Jesus and I found Billy Bragg, rediscoverd Roy Harper and it was hats of to Bob and the great leap forward.So how did I miss this one and how come it is one of those truely great albums? As you may assume it was gathering dust when I first heard it. Sad but true. Bought at a flea market with 'Slow Train Coming'-that went this stayed. Released in 1974 and featuring the Band. It is Whiney Bob at his best from the start of 'On a night Like This', the aching 'Going, Going, Gone', the squeezed our 'Forever Young' and to the last, the one I stuck on the Ipod-'Wedding Song'. Maybe it feels a bit more from the heart. Maybe there were significant Bob relationships going south, something in the water of life but whatever, this album is a jewel. And the Band make for one hell of a backing party-so the music is solid. One dud track for me is 'You Angel You'. Maybe something Prince could have taken on and done. And the good thing about whining Bob? You can sing along and sound good. Cheers mate.
1469984202|5.0|I was brought into this world completely in just the first few pages.  The play of realistic characters against an impossible environment held me to the last page.  Multiple times throughout the story I was forced to ask myself, how would I handled a similar situation?<br />I recommend this story to anyone who enjoys hard sci-fi mixed psy-fi.<br /><br />Thanks Hugh, It's been a while since I've read a story of this style and enjoyed it so thoroughly.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I have read all the John Carter Books and am a John Carter fan.  While the movie differed from the books, all movies do in one way or another.  I liked the story and the special effects.  I thought the acting was good a well.  I do not see what those who rated it a 1 star have against the movie.  I think it is the second best movie released this year.  Number one would be The Advengers.
B007K3JCAE|1.0|Movie is great, love it! It is as good as the first one. Good, fun entertainment.<br />The rest of this is directed at Warner Brothers.<br />Pay attention! Your company exists as long as we the customers are satisfied with your product. We Are Not! You made a mistake with Ultraviolet. Don't compound the issue by going down with the ship.  Cut your ties and go back to the way you used to do digital downloads which worked just fine. I am not going to download 3 different programs onto my computer, sign up for 2 different websites, and then download an App onto my iPhone just to watch a movie that I should be able to just punch in 1 code and have the movie that I paid for downloaded and available on my iPhone, computer and Apple TV.  Fix this and THEN I will buy more of your products.
B004SIP7F8|1.0|Well filmed but the two main characters are so unsympathetic, it is difficult to relate to this movie as a result of. Perhaps I am old fashion, but I don't see anything romantic about two people committing adultery.  If the movie portrayed the two main leads as being carried away by their emotions against their will and better judgment (e.g. Brief Encounter), it may have been easier to sympathize with the characters. However, it just seemed like the female lead calculated an affair for the thrill of it and when this played out against her having a wonderful and loving husband, she has lost all credability as a decent human being.  A scene where the two leads sneak off to have sex in the wings while her husband is playing Santa Claus close by just adds to the disgust of it all.  When she dies at the end, all I could think of is \\"you had it coming, lady\\".<br /><br />The only redeeming character is Juliette Binoche in a subplot who is thoroughly likeable.  Don't waste your time on this piece of ponderous soap opera.

The episodes have been great, but there is no value to buying episodes a la carte, when one can't purchase the final one. To buy the DVD set now, would cost as much as buying all of the episodes again. What a rip off!! Shame on you, HBO! If you want to see this series, get the DVDs or Blu-Rays!
1572816295|5.0|This is going to be a short review.  I have passed this tarot deck up many times thinking it would be hard for me to read or something I wouldn't gravitate to.  But someone I knew bought this deck and when she allowed me to look through and touch and play with it, I fell in love.<br /><br />I'm a Victorian Edwardian lover by heart and this deck touches on those themes of dress... also a little bit of the French Napoleon dress in this deck.  I checked out the Queen of Wands card (cause that's usually who I show up as in readings) and she was just the epitome of how I think I would look like in Eduardian times... a spunky, attractive brunette with red hues in her hair and wearing a stylish red/orange dress.  SO ME!!!!<br /><br />I like this deck just because... and because of this I can't put into words why I like it and why others should like it.  I think its individual preference.<br /><br />Even though the characters are whimsical, cartoonish, etc., they seem to have a life of their own.  Very expressionate cards with tons of details that seem to pop off subconsciously but makes a ton of sense intuitively.  For example, the Queen of Wands is elegantly and stylishly dressed but there is an eye at her stomach as what moves her tends to be her intuition.  Her headdress is high about her head, looking like a small tree... she tends to have tons of inspiring ideas and the energy to put them into reality.  Her pet looks like a rat/cat but is about the same size or bigger than her.  So what I think is femininity that is larger than life... independence and courage.  All of this from just looking at the card and gleaning a few insights from the LWB, but mostly from intuitive knowledge it tends to ignite in my mind.<br /><br />So that's why I love this deck. .. it works!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|OMG I love this game!! Sooooooooooooooo awesome. I play this every day. :) 5 stars times 100!!! :) I recommend it for everybody!

B007I2BZIE|5.0|There have been many in depth track by track reviews so I'll skip that. Geddy's voice ? Incredible ! Not the range of years ago of course but he still stretches up there a few times on this CD and nails it. Instrumentally this effort is tight. Recording much of it while they were in \\"Tour Shape\\" was a great idea. Neil's playing seems a little more spontaneous and groove oriented while still pounding the heads into oblivion. The often overshadowed talent of Alex Lifeson shines through as well. Edgy riffs, some \\"Bluesy\\" driving melodic lines, and well structured solos. Geddy's base is always spot on. Several songs even have some strings mixed in. I could never imagine three guys all around 60 years of age could do this. Best CD ever ? Of course not. Definetely one of their better ones.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I received this as a baby shower gift from my aunt and I absolutely love it, as does my husband.  The music isn't loud but it's not supposed to be, it is after all a device to get your baby to go to sleep.  I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews about the sound because that turned out to not be a concern of mine at all.  It is so easy to assemble, took me 5 minutes and it was done.  I love the Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Rainforest sound options - my favorite is definitely the rainforest though, very soothing.  The 'fuzzy' leaves open and close and the leaves with the animals attached spin around slowly.  This will definitely put any baby to sleep, it is so comforting and soothing.  I would give this product 10 stars if possible, I love it.  It also goes perfectly with our jungle theme baby room, it added the final touch to the room and it looks perfect.  I highly recommend this product to any and everyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game it has a challenge to it. This game h's multiple games the push you to continue playing and get more points.I think if you like a fun challenge you should get it

B00785P2QC|5.0|I love love love this app! :)<br />I am a level 21, have over $30,000,000, have 6 land expansions, and NOT ONCE have I EVER bought ANYHING with real money!!!<br />I wasn't originally going to get the app because of the reviews about &quot;You cant get anywhere without buying Investment Points or money.&quot;  But I got it anyways and it is definatly my favorite app on here right now!  So here's what you do if you are low on cash and/or investment points... Just do what you can, leave for an hour or so, and you should have a lot more $.  And with investment points, come back everyday, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd days in a row you come back, you get money and 1 investment point.  On day 4 you get energy and money.  (btw if I didn't mention... the money you get increases each day.)  Anyway, on the 5th day in a row you log on to the game, you get 5, yes 5 (underline the 5), investment points!!! :)  So just follow the goals and plan ahead, and you can be a level 21 with me soon! :)
0985114606|5.0|I was a little worried when I started this book that it would be too much like 50, it's not.  The story line is SO much better written and I can't wait for the next book to come out.  If you enjoyed 50 SOG, you will like this book.
B005LAIH5O|1.0|Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, and even Toby Kebbel are all wonderful actors. I dont think many will disagree with that statement. Sam Worthington is just about useless as an actor....unfortunately i may be alone in that thought. Not that Sam specifically is to blame for this putrid puddle of bile. For those unfamiliar with the story....go to google and look it up. For those who are, you have my sympathy for sitting through this garbage. Not a coherent or even interesting plot in the what seemed like forever that it took to conclude it. The writer needs to have his keyboard taken the hell away from him immediately, the director needs to be shot (in the leg...not condoning murder), and the entire class needs to be slapped and have their union cards suspended till they get to the nearest theater/acting class they can find.<br /><br />Its like all the worst things about the fast and the furious were taken and molded into greek mythology. Please consider that before you waste precious and beautiful life on this crap.
B007L96VCY|5.0|In May 1971, in the wake of an ongoing string of Beatles post-breakup solo albums (Paul's April 1970 [[ASIN:B004WJRF6C McCartney (Archive Collection)]], John's December 1970 [[ASIN:B003Y8YXFI Plastic Ono Band]], George's November 1970 [[ASIN:B00005214X All Things Must Pass [BOXED EDITION]]], Ringo's September 1970 [[ASIN:B000006N4I Beaucoups of Blues]]), most critics converged on one simple point of discussion...\\"When are The Beatles going to get back together?\\"<br /><br />Unless you count the George, Paul & Ringo participation in the \\"Anthology\\" documentary, we all know the answer to that question...\\"never.\\"<br /><br />So in 2012, I reject the idea that \\"Ram\\" (or any other Beatles solo album) is a \\"lost\\" classic. A more accurate assessment is that in 1970 & 1971...when the breakup was still a \\"fresh wound\\"...audiences and critics were listening with one ear. These were \\"yeah, but...\\" albums, as in \\"Yeah, I like some of the songs on \\"Ram,\\" but I wish The Beatles would get back together.\\"<br /><br />With the benefit of hindsight (and fresh remastering) we can now see that this solo album, actually billed as \\"Paul and Linda McCartney,\\" was in fact a very strong follow-up to the \\"McCartney\\" album, and a work rich in Paul's best Beatle-isms. It really is a monor hop, skip & jump from the [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] track \\"She's Leaving Home\\" to \\"Back Seat of My Car.\\" \\"Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey\\" is another Sir Paul suite / mini-epic, along the lines of the [[ASIN:B0025KVLUQ Abbey Road (Remastered)]] \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" song arc. \\"Smile Away\\" is a goof, cut from the same cloth as \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" with faux-Doo Wop background vocals, crunchy guitars, and off-the wall lyrics. You get a few more acoustic / rustic numbers in the \\"McCartney\\" vein like \\"Dear Boy\\" (supposedly a \\"message\\" to John that contributed to his \\"response\\" of \\"How Do You Sleep At Night\\" four months later on [[ASIN:B003Y8YXFS Imagine]]) and \\"Heart of the Country.\\"<br /><br />As rich and textured as it is, more than a few 1971 critics dismissed \\"Ram\\" as being \\"lightweight,\\" but that's probably because they didn't know Paul as going to unleash the first Wings album, [[ASIN:B00000DQYR Wings Wild Life]], in December of that year...probably his single most \\"lightweight\\" album to date with throw-away confections like \\"Mumbo\\" and \\"Bip Bop.\\"<br /><br />The reason \\"Ram\\" sounds so good in 2012...remastering aside...is that we didn't give it an objective listen in 1971. It was very, very good...perhaps even great...but we wanted The Beatles, even if Paul, John, George and Ringo did not.<br /><br />It's sweet, heartfelt, and in some places it rocks.

B000FC130E|4.0|\\"Neverwhere\\" is an urban fantasy novel by Neil Gaiman.  It tells the story of Richard, an average man in a dysfunctional relationship with his overbearing girlfriend.  One day, Richard stumbles upon a bleeding girl lying upon a sidewalk.  His decision to help her is life changing, as he finds himself sucked into the nightmarish wonderland of London Below.  London Below is inhabited by those individuals who fell through the cracks of society (and reality itself), and once Richard begins to see its denizens, he becomes invisible to people in the world above.  He follows the girl whom he rescued, whose name is Door, in the hopes of finding his way home, only to discover that Door's life is threatened by the same people who murdered her family.<br /><br />...and the villains!  Croup and Vandemar are a pair of bumbling but humorous mercenary bad guys who enjoy their job far too much.  You can't hate them, because it's very hard to take one's villains seriously when they're trying to talk with a mouth full of toads.<br /><br />The atmosphere of London Below is one of the biggest strengths of this book.  Gaiman is able to draw on both the mundane and the absurd to create a world that is simultaneously beautiful and menacing.<br /><br />One of the weaknesses of \\"Neverwhere\\" is the general lack of character development throughout the novel.  Most of the characters don't change, but Richard's perspective on them does, so I'll forgive it.  Most of the characters in London Below are unabashedly themselves.  Characters represent different archetypes and seem to have come out of a fairy tale, but one of the overreaching themes of the novel is that life isn't always what it seems and that there is more to people than meets the eye.  The minor characters are extremely memorable, such as the Amazonian woman named Hunter who is searching for a fabled Beast or the Old Bailey who talks to birds and trades in favors.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this book.  It reminds me of a darker version of Alice in Wonderland, but in a more modern setting complete with subway rats, floating markets, and plenty of hidden dangers.  Even though the book has some flaws, the story is enjoyable and imaginative.a darker version of Alice in Wonderland, but in a more modern setting complete with subway rats, floating markets, and plenty of hidden dangers.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Here's a good bit of advice. If you're going to publish your lovingly crafted, literary masterpiece on Amazon Kindle, you need to read this book.<br />At first I didn't. I naively assumed that if my books looked good on my computer screen they'd also look good on a Kindle. So I uploaded four of my books as they were, and until I got around to fixing them, I got lots of comments like, \\"Gee Kev, loved the book, but why were parts of it written in Martian.\\"<br />You see, as `Building your book for Kindle' explains, Microsoft word has a little thing called `auto correct' (BOO, HISS) and if you don't disable it and then reformat the book correctly, your wonderful tome can come out looking like a blended bowl of alphabet soup.<br />`Building your book for Kindle' explains the process in easy to understand language, with hardly any Geeklish for us, thick as toddler snot, non technocrats to contend with. Just follow the step by step instructions for a perfectly formatted book.<br />Five stars and a set of steak knives.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|Let me start out by saying I love a good romance and had recently finished the 50 shades series was looking for the next great book to read. This book was recommended on Amazon that I might like it and it had good reviews so I thought I would check it out. Well I'm so glad that it only cost me $2.99 because it wasn't worth any more than that. This book was filled with dysfunction the whole book the lead guy and girl are either screaming at each other or sitting quietly together no real passion which was made clearly obviously by the one paragraph mediocre sex scenes where he gets off but no reference to her passion or enjoyment. Oh and did I mention that the leading man in the story is psychotic??? At one point in the book they are having relationship problems and he completely trashes his apartment breaking furniture mirrors etc. and any time a man even looks at his girlfriend or tries to joke around etc. He beats them to a pulp. This is absolutely not acceptable behavior and is more fitting for the villain in the story than the so called leading man. Definitely not someone you want to be looking up to in a romance novel.<br /><br />This book was definitely a huge disappointment for me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Our anti-heroine is a whiny, vapid, easily flustered child.  Our anti-hero is a vain, selfish, heartless child.  Add to that the fact that the supporting charaters weren't all that compelling (partiularly blondes 1 through 3 or however many there were) and this book didn't work for me.<br /><br />I had heard so many great things about this book, I REALLY wanted to like it, but I couldn't make it past chapter 5 before giving up.  I'm glad for people who like it, but these characters are far too self absorbed and irritating for me to care anything about them or their little game.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the first men in black but thought the series definitely went downhill with the second movie. So I had some serious reservations about watching the third movie but I have to say it was a very pleasant surprise. In fact with the upgrade in the special effects and an upgrade in the villain since the first movie came out I have to say this is my new favorite in the series.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Being a fan of comics and the Marvel Universe, and after seeing all the other movies leading up to it, I obviously had pretty high hopes going into Avengers, and after finding out a while before that Joss Whedon was going to be directing it, I had a gut feeling it would be well done, because Joss Whedon is an awesome director.  I went within the first week with my wife and a few of our friends...made a whole day out of it.  I enjoyed just about every minute of that movie, from start to finish!<br /><br />All of the characters were really well done, (it helped that each of the directors from Ironman, Hulk, Thor, and Chaptain America came on board to help advise & whatnot), and each actor played their parts very well.  At first, my only one real concern was that Edward Norton was not going to be returning as Bruce Banner, but after watching the Avengers, I found that Mark Ruffalo was a bit better for the role in the end...he played the nerd card a bit better than Norton I thought.<br /><br />The special effects were fantastic!  I found myself totally pumped and on the edge of my seat during the action bits in the movie, and the effects done during those scenes were very well done in my opinion.  In my head, my hopes for the quantity of action was about right on, maybe just a tad higher, but really not by much.  The action sequences incorporated into this movie were just simply awesome!<br /><br />The comedy added into this movie screamed Joss Whedon (looking back on Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Firefly and whatnot), and there was just the right amount in it.  It was added in at just some of the right times, and they were great!  I laughed pretty good in those scenes.<br /><br />The story was well done, and is close enough to the comics as far as my recollection (it has been some time since I have read some Avengers comics).  Obviously, not every little detail would be added in, because that's almost impossible to do when you're converting stuff from a story that spans quite a ways.  I imagine it differs when transferring from comics as opposed to books too...there is so much detail in books, but at the same time, it's probably very difficult to transfer every detail within animation and whatnot as well.  All in all, bravo on the story though.  Of course, that's what you get too when you chose a director like Whedon who grew up reading comics and knows the material and has a real passion for that kind of stuff...you're going to get a good movie.<br /><br />All in all, this is a well rounded superhero movie, and may well be the best one I've seen thus far, right up their with the Dark Knight, which is probably my favorite DC movie up to this point.  If you have not seen this movie, please Please PLEASE do yourselves a favor and go watch it, comic fan or not...it's freakin great!  Even the action fan who isn't a big comic book lover would enjoy this movie.  I have already preordered about the best version of this movie that is going to be available, because it's worth it...even with the 3D, although I don't have 3D capability.  I don't really care...it's worth it in my opinion, because this was such a kick@$$ movie.  Definitely check it out!uite a ways.

B0073PPKNM|2.0|This one is not as good as her other albums. Trust me, they are a tough act to follow. I'm still a big fan, and there are a couple tracks I can stand behind, but a lot of this album feels like a 70s musician trying to make jazz hip to youngsters. Although I have to say, it's my favorite album cover so far (YOWZA). Will be waiting for her next album and will buy that when it comes out too.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I read all the books before the movies came out. The movies were sometimes very close to the book and sometimes not. Either way, they were all super! I loved how the delicate sexual matters were addressed in the movie since younger viewers would be watching. Can't wait for the final Part 2!

That's frustrating, but that's par for the course. Still, I love all the instruments and can picture what was happening in each song.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|This is one of the best films I have ever seen.e funded , think they´re witch - finders and that their froth mouthing hocus pocus is all about continuing the Inquisition while they officially deny it.<br />They want people to think they´re being Scientific , and they will go to any length , including people who had no interest in promoting the Inquisition , to keep their patients and the followers of their hopeless , half - brained Fringe Cult in line.<br />If that means using Freud´s name to promote a materialistic explanation for the origins of the psyche , they´ll go for it.<br />I repeat; Psychiatry´s business is first and foremost , to promote the continuance of Monotheism in the worst possible form , and of State worship , in it´s worst possible form.<br />The worse , the better but the better only if those Psychiatrists cash in on it.<br />It´s all about the money - not about promoting Scientific Research , which Psychiatry still heavily opposes.<br />Freud´s own position towards Psychiatry was , that , Psychiatry can be used for scientific purposes , but for that to work , it´d have to be much less centralized.<br />He wasn´t listened to , to the detriment of Psychiatry itself , and thus not Psychoanalysis.<br />While Psychoanalysis kept evolving and blossoming to the point of going beyound simple , materialistic explanations for things , Psychiatry itself nonetheless developed some interesting , sometimes useful methods which could help some patients to recover from past trauma , but nowhere near as useful as those of Psychoanalysis.<br />Jung´s talking cure would work for some , while not for others , and Freud was immensely interested in it.<br />I feel that as a Monotheistic Religion , Psychiatry has been used to create Scizophrenia as an alternative to the equally mythical Melancholia , and oppose the interests of Science , including Mainstream Science , and thus not benefit it.<br />I recommend excellent documentaries such as The Power of Nightmares by Adam Curtis for people who are newto Freudian and Jungian research.
B0027G783W|5.0|I love this CD by Moby. I learned about him through the movie \\"Dare Devil\\". I have several of his CDs and listen to them at work. They're relaxing.

B007KOYEOC|4.0|I have to say, when everyone started raving about this series I turned up my nose, but once I started to read I couldn't stop!<br /><br />I have just finished reading this series for the third time in 2 weeks- it is THAT GOOD<br /><br />This book certainly surprised me with its twists!<br /><br />I love that is is so easy to read, in keeping with its predecesors- Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker.<br /><br />A great and unexpected bonus was the extra bits at the end- giving an insight into Christians world- I didn't want the story to stop- I would happily read the whole lot of books again written in his POV.<br /><br />All I can say is BUY THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Be prepared to stay up all night reading!  I read this book in 5.5hrs, I would recommend it for adults ONLY- all women should read this book, all my girlfriends are loving it- single, married, Mums- ALL OF THEM!!
B001IFZL50|1.0|Well, clearly I am in the minority here...<br /><br />But if this mini series was designed to show the dullness and blandness of war, then it certainly did that well. And ended up being dull and boring to watch! You could argue that war is like that, however one particular episode when marines are coming under sustained fire from no less than 3 directions, while being cornered on a bridge - and yet the only wound *any* of them receive is a scratch - well, that just tests credibility too much. Naturally, the death toll amongst from the attackers was massive.<br /><br />Realistic? Apart from that, almost the only other action in the whole series is a convoy of Humvees shooting up some Iraqi shopkeepers in a small village and hollering like rednecks.<br /><br />After watching a few episodes, I was rooting for the Iraqi militia.
B000000WFG|5.0|This was the first ever album I got in 1998! Later that year, I got both tapes on my birthday. I went through SEVERAL copies because I wore this album out. So I got it, because it made me feel like a kid again. Now, for someone to invent the time machine. I enjoy listening to this album to relive those childhood memories.
B0084PB97G|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when buying this CD and I was ready to be disappointed by many of the tracks, but to my surprise THERE IS NOT A SINGLE BAD TRACK on the album. I cannot say this about many cds but this is truely a masterpiece. Any fan of Bobby Womack or Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz, The Good the Bad and the Queen) should add this to their collection immediately.
B000006YXV|5.0|This is a great CD. I was born and raised in Detroit so I am familiar with the Motown sound. Recommend this CD to anyone who loves the 60's & 70's sound.
B0024FAG5I|4.0|This is a film not to be taken seriously as a Western but, for what it is, it is a ton of fun so get your popcorn made and kick back.  Gary Sinese, with a small part as Sharon Stone's dad, gets overlooked for his acting chops as Sharon, Gene Hackman playing a great villain, Russell Crowe starting to become the star he is today and even the old western and Spartacus legend, Woody Strode in a fine cameo, are the meat of the film.  The character, 'Ace' by Lance Hendrickson is wickedly funny in his own way.<br /><br />I have this film on Standard Def and just bought and watched it on Blu Ray.  In the opening scene, with Sharon Stone riding through the tall grass, you can definitely see some artifacting going on.  This type of scene is extremely challenging for the best home theater systems.  For the remainder of the movie, I thought the video transfer was really quite good.  Not the best in the world but sharper than the SD disc.<br /><br />The audio made great use of the surround system and the subs get a good workout, especially at the end of the film.  I did notice, and you should as well, that when choosing the audio setup in the menu, on the upper left of the screen there is a round target that you also need to arrow up to to engage the discreet channeling to its maximum.  This is the second time I have seen something like this on a disc and I think it is simple a stupid function.  You should be able to simply chose the audio mix you want and play the movie but in this case, setting the proper audio is a two step process.  Without doing the second step you will not get the full surround you were hoping for.<br /><br />I have seen this film many times.  I find it fun and not to be taken seriously.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksa review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I read all of David BALDACCI'S BOOKS.  He knows how to keep your interest from front to back.  Reading from the Kindle is much better then holding a book.  To buy a book is easy and fast and you have a lot of choices at a good price.  I found the Kindle to be an excellent buy.
1250006341|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who has followed the Masterpiece Theater series 'Downton Abbey'; the photos and behind-the-scene interviews are very well done and give the reader a sense of participation in the time period and stories.  I got the book as a Christmas gift for my sister, who's an avid fan of the series.  It was delivered quickly, in immaculate condition ... and I can check one item off my Christmas 'to-do' list!  Thank you.

B004FOA84A|5.0|I played this game after \\"The Lost City\\" by the same developer in spite of the limited success the reviews indicated.  I loved it and .99 was certainly an appropriate price.  Yes, it's much shorter than \\"The Lost City\\", but what do you want for that price? It's well designed, fun, not very difficult (there's a walkthru, but I can't remember where I saw it), and just great for an evening.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|just like e1 else, I quickly got hooked on this game. the flaw is it just takes 2 dang long to get energy. my cash ran out and there is no way on earth I am going to pay to play this game. so, I needed to build a storage place and it wont take anything other than $ to finish building. I'm just gonna leave it undone but, if this is the catch to having the app for free, i will pass.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a wonderful game that runs flawlessly on the Kindle Fire.  The graphics are excellent and everything is easy to see (a real issue since the screen is small).  I hope this developer will make many, many more. I'm willing to pay much more than .99 for a game this long and this good!

1451627289|1.0|I've had Steven King on my list to read for a long time, but there were always too many other books to read by authors I knew.  Finally, I read my first Steven King novel picking this one because of all the great reviews.  My personal verdict... Awful, weird.  I guess that's why \\"they\\" make dark chocolate and white chocolate.  Not everything is for everyone.  This was definitely not for me.  Don't think I'll be picking up any more of his work.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|This comedy heist film has an impressive cast with Ben Stiller as the main star but also includes Alan Alda, Tea Leoni, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Gabourey Sidibe and Casey Affleck. It's a fun heist film with some surprisingly good scenes and focuses around a group of high class tower employees who find out their pensions have been mismanaged by one of the big tenants of the tower. A group of them decide to rob the big tenant's safe and that's pretty much the rest of the story. There are alternative endings but I think I liked the bittersweet one they gave to the Ben Stiller character at the end. Murphy got a lot of acclaim in his role as the two timing thief who reluctantly offers to help the others rob the tower. Alda did a wonderful job as the overall antagonist of the picture. It's a fun picture that definitely was influenced by Occupy Wall Street following.<br /><br />The budget was $75M (after tax rebates) and it made a bit over $152M at the Box Office. It was conceived as early as 2005 when Murphy pitched it as a group of men played by black comedians who do a heist at Trump Tower. It was filmed almost entirely in New York City and the high rises were supplied by Donald Trump.<br /><br />HUMOR: B; HEIST IDEAS: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE:<br />B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B0088WK27S|5.0|Real and wonderfully acted.  I normally don't watch films that have a lot of foul language and this one had its fair share, however, I am so glad I kept watching.  This film's message was strengthened by its dose of reality and the foul language, violence, ect.  is a part of that reality.  I will be buying this film!
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This \\"dramedy\\" (a comedy with dramatic moments) was well received by the critics, attaining  an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture - Drama and Best Actor - Drama for George Clooney (the main character of this picture). It won a number of lesser known awards so I'm not kidding when I tell you the critics loved it.<br /><br />So what's it about? Focus on Hawaii and a guy named Matt (Clooney) who runs a steady real estate law practice and is also the executor for a huge chunk of land worth millions to developers. It has been in the family for generations (hence the title) and most of Matt's relatives want to sell the land and make millions. Matt is going along with it but part of him wonders if they're doing a disservice to later generations in the family.<br /><br />But the real catalyst is when Matt's wife has a major boating accident and is in the hospital with a coma and Matt believes she is going to come out of it and then the doctor tells him it isn't going to happen and he needs to tell the whole family that she will be dead soon. That's when the poignant moments come into this movie which are most likely the major reason it was so well received by the critics. Add to that a dysfunctional family with secrets and you start to see everything unravel but you also get these strange moments where you can't help laughing or maybe laughing but still feeling their pain. At one point Matt tells his eldest daughter that their mother isn't going to make it (he does it clumsily at best) and the daughter submerges into the pool holding her breathe and the camera spends an inordinate amount of time focused on her facial grief. She comes up out of the pool and starts to walk away from her father not wanting to share her pain with a family member you would think she would want to do so with but that just reinforces the dysfunctional actions of this family.<br /><br />Minor spoiler coming up so stop reading if you want to go in totally blind and already know you will see this picture. Matt's eldest daughter, who is at that difficult teenager/young adult transition, tells him that his wife was cheating on him with some real estate agent (she doesn't known his name or location). As to be expected this sends Matt into an emotional meltdown and you get to see him in this undignified moment in which he's running in his boat shoes down a road to confront the best friend of his wife to find out who the cheater is and where he lives. What follows is a journey with his two daughters and a guy friend of the eldest named Sid to confront the real estate man but to also come to terms with their grief, unsaid words to the mother/wife in a coma and their overall place in the universe. This is a definite soul searching movie on several levels. People who watch this casually and don't appreciate the poignant moments will wonder what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Sid is arguably and surprisingly the closest echo character to Matt. There are a few moments of clarity in which they have these revealing conversations. That said, he's kind of an insensitive jerk at times so I enjoyed it when he got face punched by Matt's father-in-law. The eldest daughter lashes out in her rage at times, especially towards what her mother has done to the family, and the youngest daughter knows something is wrong so she goes off into dramatic situations to get attention.<br /><br />Themes about forgiveness versus vengeance when your spouse cheats on you are obvious. What type of person would you be and the film suggests you really do not know until it happens. Additionally, there's a definite thematic focus on how weird family can sometimes get with large sums of money as well as how a family can still be a family even though it's noticeably dysfunction (if the psychological stats are correct well over half of American families are dysfunctional).<br /><br />Based on a novel of the same name by  Kaui Hart Hemmings.The budget for this film was $20M and it made a bit over $82M at the Box Office. Clooney's performance, subtle at times, pumps up the quality of this picture.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; SCENERY: B plus; THEMES/FOCUSES: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.The budget for this film was $20M and it made a bit over $82M at the Box Office.

B0072IVGZG|5.0|\\"Choice Of Weapon\\" is, in my opinion, The Cult's strongest release since their controversial self-titled album in 1994. And, with the band's lineup maintained since \\"Born Into This\\", there's a welcoming tight cohesiveness to their playing, a sureness that just wasn't there before. This may as well mark the beginning of a much-needed, promising new phase in their career.<br /><br />The songs, the production, the artwork... the whole package is of an extremely high quality. Songs such as \\"Lucifer\\", \\"Wilderness Now\\", \\"Elemental Light\\", \\"The Wolf\\", \\"Life > Death\\" are very, very interesting indeed. All the other songs - including the four capsules on the bonus disc - have great hooks though, proving that the Ian Astbury/Billy Duffy team is far from burnt out. This is great news.<br /><br />\\"Choice Of Weapon\\", while not quite as brilliant as their classic output, manages to generate enough light to keep them very much alive in my book. If The Cult would only pick this spark up and ignite more fire, this could well be a renaissance for the group. Keep them albums coming, there are still too many of us and the eagerness for the experience is stronger than ever.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's a shame that Random House must not have any editors in their employ anymore.  It's an even greater shame that something as awfully written is such a moneymaker.  Twilight was badly written, but at least it turned into a romance novel at some point and became tolerable.  I gave up on this book as the young lip chewer was getting ready to board the helicopter.  I just couldn't take the writing anymore.  Such a waste of money.  Amateur level writing.  It was so bad, I wanted to google to find a porn site just to get something out of my time.  Mediocre garbage.

B007KAJG3K|4.0|When Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. gave Sherlock Holmes a makeover as more of a quirky, intellectual action hero, the duo managed to recreate Holmes in a unique 21st century way that allowed for an appealing, fun film that actually had a plot.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\\" improves on the first film the duo made deepening the great rapport between Holmes and Watson (Jude Law who marvelously reinterprets Watson moving him even further away from the Nigel Bruce interpretation where Watson--an intelligent and sharp individual--was played as a bit of a buffon)taking what's been done with each succeeding actor to play the role. Casting Jared Harris (\\"Mad Men\\", \\"Fringe\\") as Dr. Morarity gives Downey a perfect foil in the film. Morarity has his own Dr. Watson in the form of Sebastian Moran (Paul Anderson who does a marvelous job)as well making Morarity even more of a doppleganger for Holmes than before as portrayed here.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />Holmes finds himself in the middle of a series of terrorist bombings trying to unravel the role that Morarity is playing in the role of the murder of some of Europe's leaders. Complicating things Watson is getting married and Holmes fears the loss of his partner in solving crime.<br /><br />The film adapts elements from a number of Doyle's stories and integrates original elements as well which makes it both familiar and just different enough for those who have read the stories to be a bit surprised.<br />The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a sharp presentation and the colors are slightly desaturated much like the first film. Detail and grain are quite evident throughout and this is a nice looking presentation of the film.<br /><br />Interestingly, unlike the first film Holmes makes mistakes or seems a step behind at times as he's finally met a worthy advesary in Professor Morarity a man as brilliant as Holmes who takes pleasure in outwitting him.<br /><br />The audio sounds terrific with an immersive lossless presentation. Audio is clear and we do get subtitles in English and Spanish.<br /><br />Now the bad news: If you are an itunes user this uses Ultraviolet which a lot of folks don't care for as it's a streaming service for your computer, etc. It does state it in bold print in the back. According to the fine print (and I'm getting old because I could barely read it), Ultraviolet is not compatable with itunes --unless I misread the fine print--could we print this a bit LARGER next time guys?).<br /><br />You do get a DVD with the film as well as the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Special features include a visual commentary track using the Maximum Movie Mode hosted by Downey, storyboards, \\"Focus Points\\" (which are also accessible via the Max Movie Mode)and stills galleries. There is a movie ap that can be downloaded to a tablet or phone (I didn't use this on my ipad--wasn't interested in watching two screens at once).<br /><br />The special features that we do get are quite nice and compliment an already fun movie. For those folks that want to watch this on a portable device via itunes, you're out of luck. For those that hate Ultraviolet, you're out of luck. I do wish that Ultraviolet would go away or at least improve at some point but I don't expect that to happen since Hollywood (who, by the way, insists on putting new piracy notices that you have to sit through twice as long--really folks if there are pirates out there do you think 1) they care 2)they didn't use software to skip that and just copy the movie?--end of my rant about fooolish things).<br /><br />\\"A Game of Shadows\\" is an enjoyable adventure and is actually (IMHO) a better movie than \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" with sharper writing and plotting.<br /><br />This isn't your father's Holmes (whether that be Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Holmes or Basil Rathbone) nor is it the same as the almost sociopathic portayal by the marvelous Benedict Cumberbatch on the BBC series \\"Sherlock\\")with Downey giving us his own unique performance that hints a the darkness of the character but still makes him fun.<br /><br />If you're willing to give the makers a bit of leeway with the portrayal of Holmes here, you'll enjoy \\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\\".ance that hints a the darkness of the character but still makes him fun.<br /><br />If you're willing to give the makers a bit of leeway with the portrayal of Holmes here, you'll enjoy \\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\\".

B005LAIGWS|1.0|The first \\"Ghost Rider\\" movie for all of its flaws was still cheesy fun. This \\"reboot\\" (it's a reboot according to the directors not a sequel although if you've got the same actor playing the same role I'm a bit perplexed as to how it could be a reboot)\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" does have some moments of cheesy fun but it's mostly joyless compared to the first movie which at least had fun with the character (or at least more fun than what we see here).<br /><br />Johnny Blaze (Cage) gets roped into protecting the child of Satan with the promise that he will be cured of his afflication kissing the Ghost Rider goodbye. Predictably he finds that he needs the Ghost Rider just when he wants to get rid of him.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" isn't the worst movie ever made but, like the \\"Crank\\" movies that these directors made, it isn't exactly a good movie or even decent. It IS fun seeing Nic Cage chew the scenery although it's almost to the point of badly overacting pushing the boundary even of the first film where he appears almost restrained by comparison.<br /><br />Some sequences take place (particularly the climax) during daytime and the Rider's only supposed to appear in darkness--I believe it's supposed to be dawn but it looks closer to late afternoon to me.<br /><br />Cage is matched for bad acting here by Ciran Hinds who is, well, just BAD. There's a lack of fun in his performance although it's clear he was trying to go for the cheesy over-the-top approach that Cage used, his role isn't quite as showy and he isn't given as much to work with which makes his portrayal as Satan  flatter by comparison.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks quite nice--nice detail, sharp looking and the film which was shot digitally with a Red camera (I suppose you could call it beta testing since the camera hadn't even been released yet) gives the directors a bit more flexibility in shooting the movie. According to the featurette it allowed them to use traditional 35mm lens which probably complimented the look of the film.<br /><br />Audio is immersive and dialog is clear throughout. Subtitles are in English and Spanish and, like other Sony releases, the subtitles are placed on screen under the character saying the dialog which helps for those who are hard of hearing in keeping track of who is saying what.<br /><br />The special features include featurettes on the decision to reboot--the departure point was a David Goyer script that was written BEFORE the first \\"Ghost Rider\\" film. The directors liked the elements and it was rewritten by Goyer with a pair of writers that worked on \\"Flash Forward\\" the TV show. We also learn WHY the film was shot in Eastern Europe and the challenges (including the destruction of an abandoned factory that they were going to shoot at but were assured would still be there when they returned)of shooting on location including the disconnect between local government and their liaison). We also get behind-the-scenes footage that's quite interesting documenting the issues they faced (including shooting on a bridge that was supposed to be blocked off for a stunt but had heavy traffic during the entire shoot).<br /><br />We also get some deleted and extended scenes that wouldn't have added all that much to the movie but are interesting to see.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" surely was one of the worst popcorn movies of this year. The film lacks the cheesy over-the-top badness of the first movie and the smaller production suffers by comparison compared to the firsts film (which was epic by comparison).

1609611543|5.0|This is one of many sources of wheat elimination that I have perused. Dr. Robert Lustig's seminars on youtube, Deep Nutrition and Weston A. Price's Nutritional Degeneration are some of my favorite other sources. The best part of the book is the first half for me, I'll admit- it gets a little redundant at times after that. I was interested in what Dr. Davis said about the progression of wheat from millennia ago to today. I think it is very, very important to realize that, even though you may personally think you don't have a reaction to wheat, understanding the science behind modern wheat is crucial to understanding what you eat. People can compare this book to Atkins all they want, but I think Davis brings up some new points about what new wheat does to the body. Genetically modifying our food does not lead to happy endings. I think that is the biggest take-away from this book. Think about where your food comes from and how it came to be. Then, think about why the obesity, cancer and other illness rates keep going up and up. You are what you eat.<br /><br />My personal story:<br />I'm currently 39 weeks pregnant. I have been following a relatively strict Paleo diet for the last 3-4 months of my pregnancy. I have also done \\"low carb\\" before- 3 years ago - I lost about 15lbs. Being pregnant made me become very conscious about what I was eating because everything that I ingest impacts my baby. Many people think I am crazy for eliminating wheat and sugar during my pregnancy, but all my bloodwork, what my doctor and how I feel says completely otherwise. I feel satisfied after eating. I have virtually no \\"cravings.\\" When I get hungry, it is not an overwhelming urge to eat the first thing I see. I do not think about eating frequently throughout the day as many of my coworkers do. I snack very little at all. I am a very active person; I walk about 2-3 miles at work (in a nursing home) and still manage to have enough energy being pregnant to keep my house clean and go the gym a couple days a week. Most people think it's my genetics or something other than my diet. Both of my parents are morbidly obese, as well as much of my extended family. When I wasn't eating Paleo early in my pregnancy, the \\"food coma\\" would set in after I ate. I had less energy and I was gaining weight on my body (not the baby) much faster. I attribute how great I feel today to how I eat. I look forward to staying Paleo with my baby and keeping her on a Paleo diet when she starts solids.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|To put aside the logic of how some events transpired in the book (a lot of things that a occurred were so unrealistic but...) , I was wrapped up in the story of what's happening in Margrave.  It's a very entertaining novel and I couldn't put it down.  With that said, I have to admit that there were some aspects that was a bit tedious/boring to read.<br /><br />I liked the novel even though it was a little predictable, some actions by Reacher was improbable and the end was somewhat disappointing.

B004132HZS|5.0|When it said season 1 I thought it would be a lot longer. However, it was very entertaining; Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman played their parts perfectly. If you're a fan of Sherlock holmes related stuff or Benedict Cumberbatch you should definitely buy this. But like I said before it's a very short series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is fun because. it makes me want to see the fourth movie because it has all thes new caretprs
0439023521|5.0|This book was quite good. I particularly enjoyed the thriller qualities that the book had during the games section.

It is very easy for the reader to fall in love with the main character, Susie Salmon, as she struggles with her fate and tries to find answers in her situation.

0439023513|5.0|This final installment in the Hunger Games series was very good. I enjoyed the fact that the main character was more involved in the background plot of the first two books-namely the war. The entire book was one exciting moment after another which made my hands sweat in nervousness of what the ending would be like.  This novel completes the legendary Hunger Games series, making it a story to remember by future generations to come.<br />Zachary B. Medina<br />Author of Decador
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This set was ment to be an add on. If you hve purchased the \\"Lego battle of helms deep\\" your in luck! This set can attach this set to the wall of the helms deep set! I am happy to pay $30 for this set because not only its an add on, but it has six minifigures! which is rare for a $30 set.If you sold this set minifig by minfig on ebay you could easly end up with doubble or more what you paid. But it also adds many Urak-Hai to your collection and two Rohan warriors to your army. To be honest i would buy more of these sets. Bigger castle bigger army, what else can you ask for? I really think your child would love this set! Even without the Rohan castle they still have many minfigs and castle wall. it could be cheaper but i got it for $27 and Amazon will do a lower price than $30. I still think $30 or less its still an amazing army and castle builder. Please rate or leave a comment or ask a question Thanks! -------This has been a Deal Hunter review--
0439023491|4.0|A good sequel to The Hunger Games. I enjoyed the second round of the games which the main characters were dragged into. The introduction of new characters refreshed the series' plot and made it more interesting. The first half of the book was somewhat boring however. Katniss's reaction to the Quarter Quell was an awkward moment as well...<br />Zachary B. Medina,<br />Author of Decador
B007Q0OUNA|3.0|Ok so i am for sure buying this set. But not yet, why? because its outrageously overpriced! with around 450 pices and charging $60. Thats overcharging by $10, you could get a ninjago figure set or other small sets or whatever! So im waiting for amazon to lower the price. Its a set i could live without. And trust me amazon WILL lower the price so they sell more sets and make faster profit. And if your wondering why lack of main figures, its because lego whats you to buy ALL of the lego sets so you can buy all the sets for the figures. And i am buying all the sets because im a mager fan of lord of the rings. But im also being smart by waiting for lower prices. i already saved $50 on lord of the rings sets and i still havent bought them all. All in all i would get this set for the awsome figures but still i would wait for a lower price if your not totally all for the set. Please rate and comment and ask questions -----This has been a Deal Hunter review- My main goal is to help you save money
0143039830|5.0|Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy is a masterpiece that should be read by any and all lovers of mystery novels. Though it is simple in comparison with other mystery novels of the present-day, it is just as entertaining. As the reader treads further into the story, they will most likely become more involved with the characters as they start to make connections and understand the situations they get into. The New York Trilogy is entertainment for all lovers of Mystery Fiction.<br />Zachary B. Medina<br />Author of Decador

0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is a novel that gives both entertainment and knowledge to its readers. Orson Scott Card has constructed and written a book that can entertain any age group as long as they enjoy science fiction. At times the book is somewhat confusing as well. The dreams that Ender has bewildered me when I read them. The ending is also a very confusing, yet delightful way for the book to wrap up. Even though Ender's Game is the first book of a series, I believe it can be read as a standalone novel as well.<br />Zachary B. Medina<br />Author of Decador
0425263908|3.0|I know that everyone prefers a different story line...this is not my preference. I enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey SOOO much more. It's still along the same line as FIFTY, however, I do not feel that the relationship between the main characters is as intensely written as E.L. James series 'Fifty Shades'. With that said...it's an OK alternative to the Fifty series.

B0069UV0LS|5.0|Seriously... without a doubt... one of the deepest ,suspenseful, suck you into it movies I have ever seen.. This dark drama, is horrifying, sentimental, wonderful and I could go on and on.. A true test of ones emotional extremes..  Short side is I really liked it.. The acting is superb, it is 100 % believable and has NOTHING to do with pre-historic creatures, but centers on good old  EMOTION. The strong dialect, is challenging at times to understand, but to me added such a fine quality to the production.. I never watch a movie twice, but  the button at h u l u  said  replay, and I hit it.. The second time around I understood the words alot better..

B006VFLIYK|5.0|As always, Baldacci manages to develop the lead character so well that the reader genuinely feels like you know him.  The intricacies of the plot are fascinating enough to keep one going, yet lay down enough clues to figure out who the \\"bad guy\\" really is.

B000002I8D|5.0|This was one of my favorite albums when it came out at the beginning of the '80s, and it really represented a special time for me. Unfortunately, our house burned down  at the beginning of 2000; and I lost my vinyl collection including \\"Face Value\\". I've replaced most of those with CDs that I could find as not all of them have been reproduced, but I kept forgetting to get \\"Face Value\\". I finally remembered, and I'm so happy that I did get this again as I now remember how important it was for my life. It's worth it alone just for the song, \\"In The Air Tonight\\"; but there are many gems here. This is not your usual pop album; but has a lot of jazz influences, some instrumentals, and some almost experimental pieces. What's remarkable is that it's still fresh and pertinent today. I'm so glad that I finally put this back into my collection, and I highly recommend it to anyone else who loves music. Remember, it is an all time classic CD; and a necessary addition to the collection of anyone who is a serious collector of popular music.

0091947561|5.0|I defy anyone to read this book and not have lots ideas that challenge them to raise the bar - in their business or their personal life.<br />This is  a cleverly laid out very well written book which is an easy read - apart from the fact that it may make your head hurt with new ideas. Ahmed and Olander share lots of relevant and current example of digital strategic thinking in action, while sparing non teckies like me the technological explanations.<br />This is a doer's book written by people who have done it (and done it with style, panache and creativity).<br />It's a book that is extremely relevant to the current turbulent environment -and throughout it shines the human values that are needed to get us out of our current economic mess.<br />A must read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|what an amazing app!  AND it's free!  There are so many different versions at your fingertips.  Very easy to use.  I love to look up a variety of different versions to help me grasp what a scripture is teaching and it's so nice to be able to do it with such ease.
B007MAETA8|3.0|It's hard to judge new music from an artist whose old music has seeped so thoroughly into your life and memories. It's as though I'm judging a recently added body part.<br /><br />As others have said, John Mayer music takes longer than most of its genre (whatever this may be) to appreciate, so it may be too early to judge. However, my impression after about five listens is a comfortable excitement with a number of the songs on the album that are very recognizably \\"John Mayer\\" (I'd say \\"Something Like Olivia\\" is most clearly in this zone, being about a vague female encapsulating some longing and some confusion, laid on a deceptively simple guitar track) but also some dissatisfaction with some tracks that seem too repetitive and immediately apparent. I think \\"Queen of California\\" includes positive surprises, like a certain charming lilt with the words \\"I'm heading out west with my headphones on,\\" and I enjoyed \\"Born and Raised\\" as well. However, I found the mid-introduction percussion phrase of \\"The Age of Worry\\" to be a little contrived, and I grew tired of the repetitive lyrics in a number of the other songs.<br /><br />In the end, I'm a little disappointed that nothing yet has captured me with the cleverly mundane imagery of \\"I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker\\" or \\"Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank at all/ for something someone yelled real loud one time.\\" But again, John Mayer has often revealed himself in layers to me, and perhaps I'll be back to edit in a few months.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|the app is ok its just that you keep have to tap the foods and coins every second. and also have non stop missions.
B00881VLCE|4.0|its fun. it gives you a challenge.  I enjoy puzzles.  I play these with my 6 year old daughter&hellip;<br /><br /> so it is a learning time for us which is awesome!

B004UID2LC|5.0|I love the app. it should 5 stars not 3 1/2. it works excellent on my kindle fire. You should buy it!
B007TBCTRK|3.0|I liked it but it seemed to be trying to be different things at different times and exhausting itself by the effort..never quite finding its own identity, much like the movie in some ways.<br /><br />There are two exceptions...<br /><br />1. \\"Life\\". This is the theme that opens the movie.<br />You can hear the mystery, the feeling that something magical, unique and amazing is about to unfold.<br /><br />2. \\"Space Jockey\\". Here's a theme of serious and immediate menace...a sort of other worldly 'war drums', which goes perfectly with the events transpiring on screen.<br /><br />\\"A friend from the past\\" really bothered me. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but Ridley Scott insists this isn't an Alien prequel, but in this track we find Alien's main theme reused. <sigh> If only Scott would have made up his mind and stuck to it, maybe the soundtrack and the movie would have found its identity and perhaps found the recipe to becoming a true classic.
B007MDB71O|4.0|The hatred to this movie by the critics seemed like some kind of self-congratulating schadenfreude bandwagon.  Due to all the FUD put out by the critics and others (the hype about how expensive it was and how it was a flop)  I didn't see this in theaters.  I finally rented it on Amazon download (HD).  I was pleasantly surprised.  I found it to be an entertaining and worthwhile fun movie.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  While I definitely liked the movie, I notice there is someone (or two) rabid fanboy posters who are copying and pasting the exact * same * comment throughout large parts of the discussion thread.  They may even be one and the same person (sock puppets?)  This kind of crap devalues and degrades the whole Amazon review discussion thread.  Please STOP.  If you liked the movie (and I did) then ...groovy.  Just trust this movie enough to let it stand on it's own and get a life... without pasting robotic comments throughout the entire discussion of this movie!  Don't badger me lobbying to write in for for a sequel.  It's really rude.  If I ever wanted a sequel the desire for it will come within me and not from some outside manipulation.  Unlike fanboys, my identity doesn't come from this movie, it's just something I enjoyed.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />As I mentioned when I reviewed Hunger Games, I almost didn't read this book because everyone was reading it.  New York Times best sellers often don't make my cut.  The dystopian world featured in the first book expresses worry that the suppressed rabble may not continue their studied indifference and thus the dictators up the odds on the bread and circus tournament.<br /><br />As compelling as I found the first story, I found Catching Fire, even more so.  I struggled to get anything else done.  Collins excels at eliciting empathy for her characters.  Not just he main characters either, she entices you into caring about even minor characters.  I think that is the strength of these books, the superb characterizations.<br /><br />The plot continues to evolve as do the characters.  There are necessary reminders that the main protagonist is a 17 year old girl.  The horrific events are successfully counter pointed with the pathos exhibited by the characters.<br /><br />This is a three book series, two down and one to go!<br /><br />I did enjoy the book and I recommend it.
B007SGM084|4.0|While it isn't going to be considered a literary classic in the future it did make for a lot of book talk conversation with friends!<br />I felt a little like when I was in elementary school and discovered Judy Blume wrote books that weren't just about \\"Fudge\\".<br />It is edgy, erotic and easy to read.  It is not for the weak at heart and it may just spice up your love life!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this series after trying the free sample, and was quite taken in with the story.  I am often reluctant to try new authors, preferring to stick with my tried and true favorites -- but I have a new one now.  I like believable human stories, and technology, and both were available in quantity.  The struggle between good and evil always adds interest, too.  I just obtained the next installment in the series, and have started reading it immediately.  I expect great things from this author in the future.
B0086700CM|5.0|great to play when your bored. I have had no problems with it. great for a free app! good time passer.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far I've found this app to be super helpful and I've only explored the text side of it. I love how I can access it over several platforms: my iPhone, my Kindle Fire, and my iMac.
0439023521|4.0|There may be little point reviewing The Hunger Games. My readers usually fall into two categories - those who already love Suzanne Collins' mega-selling trilogy, and those who have consciously decided not to read it. But I would like to address a sub-section of the latter group: those who only saw the movie, but think they have experienced the story.<br /><br />They haven't.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; it's a good movie. Convincing performances, a strong screenplay, et cetera. But the book was more than just plot and dialogue. The book was Katniss' hollow belly as the Capitol starved her and her family. The book was her mounting dread as she prepared for the Games, and her terror as she played them. The book was her grief and rage as good people were slaughtered around her for no reason at all. The book was her Mockingjay pin; not just what it looked like, but what it represented.<br /><br />Film adaptations make the sights and sounds of a story much more real, but the themes and sensations are inevitably diluted to almost nothing. I have every reason to hate The Hunger Games - it completely overshadowed the US release of my own distopian action novel, The Lab - but even so, I'm urging you to read the trilogy. The movie is a fun way to spend a couple of hours, but only the book can make you understand what the fuss was about.
0345803485|1.0|The author should have titled this book \\"50 Shades of Horrible\\" because that's what it was, and thankfully, I can use the \\"was\\". Note I am not using 'WAS' (caps are a big no no in the emailing/texting)... The email messages are \\"like\\" teenagers are sending them and are enough to make you toss this piece of trash out, but for some reason I finished it, biting my lip and rolling my eyes... And at the end of the book you are left with no answers. It may be a good thing because the answers may make you vomit. Oh, wait, vomit... Ana did that in \\"the local flora\\" in front of a bar!!! Please... how old is she? She has never gotten drunk, had sex, masturbated, had a normal adult conversation... She is the optimal ANNOYING. Love me, love you, hate me, hate you, dominate me, dominate you, flip me around in a glider, fly me in first class and leave the seat next to me empty, find me, lose me, beat me, love me.. And through it all is creepy Taylor lurking in the background... Yuck! At least Christian is consistent, a first class, very wealthy a**h***. Who in their right mind would recommend this literary piece of trash?! For curiosity I am tempted to read #3 and see what the ***k, or should I say holy ***k, happens to them. Maybe they both blow up while riding in his private jet or helicopter or Audi or boat. Oh wait, I am not sure he is a sailor yet. That gives them something to add to his long list of achievements. I certainly would skip book #2 because the way I see it, it will only be a sophomoric repeat of this awful mess. Why would you order seconds of horrible meatloaf in a bad diner? On second thought I think I will just pass completely. I want to read it, I don't want to read it, I want it, I don't wan it, blah, blah, blah... Let's just smack them both upside the head with this book and call it done!
B00845PV16|1.0|This 2nd movie of the Ghost Rider is quite pathetic. Nicholas Cage acted like a junkee needing a fix, (And not allowing himself one), and the Ghost Rider acted totally out of character and they changed his powers to boot. If you want to waste your money, this is definitely the movie to buy!
0486278077|3.0|Normally, I would love a Gothic novel, even if it flaunts conventions and is highlighted by long-winded descriptions of proper gentility.  However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.<br /><br />Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.<br /><br />Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others.
B0086700CM|4.0|these cheats are even WORKING! But the game is pretty fun. I'd give it 4stars. You should buy it because its free.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game. Only issue I have is sometimes the finger swipes you use to control the turns,  jumps etc don't register or the character will jump instead of turn. (I play on kindle fire). can be very frustrating when you're on a good run. luckily this issue isn't all that frequent, and doesn't discourage me from playing hah. I also find it refreshing that this game is not only free, but it also doesn't have objectives that are impossible without real money. It is pretty challenging too!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I first saw people wearing Tom's, but after trying on a friend's pair, I decided I needed my own and I'm so glad I did. I bought the gray solid ones and I love them. They're comfortable, go with anything and are easy to slip on and off. They run true to size, so like the other reviewers, I don't suggest buying a size up or down.

B00884GR0W|5.0|At first when I bought the game, it didn't work right. Mind blocks mixed up the loading screens, so you couldn't save anything. Fortunately, they updated it as soon as they figured it out, so the game became awesome. For any potential buyers out there, this game is amazing and is just like minecraft, only a bit more dungeons-and-dragons than minecraft. Mind blocks, you hit a homerun here, and I cant wait till the ladders-and-doors update. Graphics are great, gameplay is cool, it's just an all around good game. In my opinion, the only thing wrong with it is the fact that it freezes a lot.<br />P.S. You craft by tapping where you want the block to be, but you have to be away from the area that it will be placed. Good luck!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|After \\"SNAKES AND ARROWS\\" and its strong and structured songs of faith and redemption, \\"CLOCKWORK ANGELS\\" appears a bit of a letdown. It's not really interesting as a \\"concept album\\". The music is all over the place. And I'm going to echo the chorus here and say that this is essentially \\"VAPOR TRAILS 2\\" in regards to its sound mix.<br /><br />I loved \\"HEADLONG FLIGHT\\" only because of its chorus, and Lee's phenomenal vocals on it. But that's the only song that stands out to me. I honestly can't remember any other song on the CD. With \\"SNAKES AND ARROWS\\", I was singing along for days, and still those songs hit me.<br /><br />\\"CLOCKWORK ANGELS\\" is going to demand some serious listening from even the most hardened of fans.
B0086700CM|4.0|Yes, this game is extremely fun and addictive, but the controls to turn are backwards or funky. Other than that, I love this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is just a great time killer. The game is simple like most games that are so addictive. Great way to pass a few minutes.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books have helped me make connections between the characters better. Not to mention answer some questions I had.  I love how my husband and I can both read it and keep up with our places.  Once I purchased the books I had them instantly and at a great price.
B007B17XW4|5.0|I bought this top for my 12-year-old grandson, and he loves it!  That's all I need to know.... I suspect any inquisitive boy who has had any contact with Lego toys-- and likes them-- would feel similarly.
B007G5H2HQ|2.0|The Puss in Boots character was my favorite thing in the Shrek franchise. I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes, but the rest of the movie was a pointless drag. This was overly long, and the plot was boring. Jack, Jill, and especially Humpty Dumpty were creepy and unpleasant characters. It was fun when Puss was doing silly cat things, but that only added up to about 10 minutes.
1451621175|5.0|A classic story of soldier life in war:  the bitter, the sweet, the horrific, the comic and the tragic.  It re-enforces the notion why all should oppose war!
0805092447|5.0|When I first got this over two years ago for my now 3 year old son, I thought how can this book get so many great reviews. It was the redundant \\"brown bear, brown bear, what do you see...\\" \\"I see a ___ looking at me...\\". This book actually became one of his favorite books and now his 1 year old brother is loving it too! The board book is now a little torn so I may purchase this again. Other great books are Goodnight Moon and The Going to Bed Book.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have never posted a book review before, but felt that I just had to add my 2 cents regarding this book. For me, overall it was boring.  Boring characters, boring plot, and some of the most boring sex scenes I have ever read.  My best guess is that many of the people who love this book don't read a lot, or at least have never read much, if any erotica.  I do have to say kudos to the author. It is apparent from the many, many people that I have talked to about this book, that she has somehow captured the attention of the American public and gotten people that hardly ever read for enjoyment, to read not just one but three books.  I love the fact that everywhere I go, people are talking about a book.  If just half of the people that loved this book go on to add reading to their list of favorite pastimes, then she has accomplished a wonderful thing.  I don't regret purchasing this book and I don't regret the 3 or 4 hours it took me to read it.  Whether I like a book or not, I always learn something and don't consider any book I have read a waste of my time.
0671449028|4.0|I got this for my son over two years ago (now 3). I would read this very often even though he didn't know much about reading at few months old. It's one of his favorite books that I even have it memorized! I \\"read\\" it to him even without the book sometimes and he still likes to listen.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great puzzler game with a ton of replayability. I come back to this game every few months. The developer is always adding new levels and game types.
0060775858|4.0|I bought this book based on reviews. When I first read it, I wasn't sure if my son would like it but I read it to him when he was several months old and now that he's 3, he still likes me to read this to him sometimes. I say the best books to read to children (even when they're just 3-4 months) is this one, Brown Bear Brown Bear and The Going to Bed Book - all of which have best reviews.
B005ZUR724|5.0|great game.plays very similarly to WoW. worth the money and should be rated higher in my opinion.  it's a must get
B007IXWKUK|5.0|One of the best books/trilogies I have ever read. Highly recommend. I read all 3 books in 4 days. I couldn't put them down.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game!  the only problem i have is that my sister is unable to download it to her fire!  gameloft has been no help!  We thought kindle support could help too, but they referred us to gameloft who she has never heard back from.  Very disappointed.
0857520172|4.0|This novel is based around a plot device that seems hard to hold together, yet the author pulled it off nicely. To be sure, there were a few cases when I felt as though it slipped into mystery novel mode, focusing on plot over character. But these occasional slips were minor, and in the end, I read a complex and intriguing character with depth and dimension. It's certainly gripping from the start, and left me unsure of the outcome and caring about several characters throughout.<br /><br />It's not quite subtle enough to be art, but it's clear the author has talent and nuance that I suspect will develop soon enough.
B005FJ7DOM|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one. The story made no sense, bad acting. Way to long for to finish, not scary and the ending was a big disapointment. Nothing is made clear!!
B000002G26|4.0|BRYAN ADAMS-SO FAR SO GOOD: Throughout the 80s, canuck songwriter/guitarist BRYAN ADAMS rolled out an impressive string of hooky, hard-nosed pop rockers only occasionally interrupted by laid back love songs bearing titles like STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART and HEAVEN. ADAM's rusty nail of a rasp and gutsy riff-raff bolstered his breakthrough smash CUTS LIKE A KNIFE, the fired up TINA TURNER duet IT'S ONLY LOVE, and nostalgic singalong SUMMER OF '69, the latter two pulled from his flawless high water mark album RECKLESS; it all sounded familiar yet somehow fresh at the same time. It's the upbeat stuff like THIS TIME and HEAT OF THE NIGHT that prove the most fun to revist on this career roundup...even though one of his best rebel-rousers, SHE'S ONLY HAPPY WHEN SHE'S DANCIN' inexplicably missed the cut. ADAMS eventually morphed into more of a balladeer than a rocker, triggered no doubt by the runaway success of (EVERYTHING I DO) I DO IT FOR YOU...but overall (and in spite of a few \\"prom staples\\"), SO FAR SO GOOD maintains a crackling party-hearty atmosphere.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR CROAKS
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This is a must see. Very funny, ok acting. The story is so twisted, tucker and dale are awesome characters.
B004132HZS|3.0|I loved the show and was happy to get the video.  Unfortunately it had to skip damaged sections every once in a while.
B007OUFESC|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie after watching the previews some time ago, however, I was disappointed in the movie overall.  Unless you're deep into Jung and Freud and enjoy scene upon scene of deep discussions about your repressed sexuality, this movie isn't for you.  Kiera Knightley's performance of a disturbed woman who from childhood gets off sexually from physical abuse, is over the top.  As some reviewers pointed out, she painfully overplays the part trying to look quite mad, which only brings you to the brink of madness watching her physical contortions.  The remainder of the movie deserves deep attention to understand the musings of the two psychiatry giants of the past.  The timeline jumps from one thing to the other a bit disjointed and actually in parts makes no sense whatsoever, such as Freud having what appeared to be a stroke, and then in the next scene is perfectly fine.  Also, if you're offended by brutal belt beatings of Kiera's behind while being tied to the bed, and Jung getting off sexually by playing into her odd sexual needs she now has freedom to express at her doctor's hand, I suggest you skip the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app! I wish I could give it 4 and a half because sometimes it is slow and the person wont move right but over all it is amazing!
B007XWFZSA|5.0|a very good book by Victor Cheng. Fantastic insight into consulting and a great resource for those applying to consultancy firms like mckinsey
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book!! Racey, yes, but the way the story shows how true love can break down walls is inspiring. The only bad thing is that every woman who reads this finds herself wanting a Fifty of their own. ((giggle)) Myself included!
B004J7D3TK|1.0|I received this video and it was badly used there were parts of the video that were unreadable<br />Not a very satisfying experience
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Emeli Sande not only has an Amazing voice but she is an excellent song-writer and she plays the piano as well. This album is Excellent from the first song to the last. There are no fillers on this album just great songs after great songs. Every 4 to 5 minutes my favorite song changes which rarely happens when I listen to an artist whole album.
B0071R43MG|5.0|I've got all Satch's DVDs as I'm a huge fan. His soloing here is unmatched by any of the others. Joe is always amazing, but on these discs I noticed at once a level of stylistic maturity only hinted at on previous discs. He stretches out a little more and effortlessly plays more melodic and more sophisticated ideas than what I'm used to hearing from him.<br /><br />The variety of tunes is especially good too. You'll get your old faves and plenty more from Joe's expansive past offerings. The video and sound quality are excellent too.<br /><br />If I could only own one Satch video, this would be it. No question.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The sound wasn't as I expected, It was so low.<br />I really was looking for an excellent mic for a low price as I've seen from the reviews but it appears my guess was wrong.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun app... I play it all the time.. I love it. it has a lot of fun games
B00846TTDG|1.0|This movie has not just a few problems :<br /><br />1) Absolutely terrible acting. I'm pretty sure I've never seen a movie with worse acting than this.<br /><br />2) A plot line that has more holes than Swiss Cheese. It makes my 12-year old brother's scripts seem like Shakespearean pieces of work<br /><br />3) Over-the-top nationalistic and patriotic overtures. Makes me feel like I'm watching a brain-washing movie about our greater-than-thou military might.<br /><br />This movie made me completely lose trust and hope in Amazon's Reviews.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it is the best game in the whole world I was just like I'm geting this game right now.
B0000U5RNU|5.0|Any fan of Mr. bean or for that matter, Rowan Atkins, will love this movie. A delightful departure from the usual stupid comedies that are so common these days. I enjoyed this movie in the theater and now enjoy it at home. A movie full of laughs and enjoyment.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its very fun and addicting but if you don't like Mario I don't reccomend you play this. Almost everything is the same, except for the theme. But still enjoyable.
B0076R62FM|5.0|Anyone who likes or has enjoyed Mr. bean or the original Johnny English will love this movie. I find this movie a delightful change from the normal comedy movies. Rowan Atkins is a truely funny actor and his character-Johnny English,is full of laughs. I enjoyed this movie and continue to enjoy it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids love this game. They enjoy the mini games and watching the Scrat short film.  It works great on the kindle fire.
0316098329|5.0|This book is an absolute masterpiece.  It succeeds to an enormous degree on many levels: original premise, original way of expressing the story, maintaining interest and suspense, growth of characters, true insight into their emotions and thoughts.  Perhaps most impressively, it maintains heightened interest through all phases of the story, where many authors might succeed only in captivating the reader for the first third of the book.<br /><br />One reviewer said it started out well and had a mediocre finish.  I disagree, and actually suggest that it is one of the best endings I have read in a very long time.  This book is one of the best storytelling achievements I have seen in many, many years.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I found this game to be quite silly and a waste of time. I wouldn't suggest getting this app. although they give you the game for free and then expect you to pay to advance in the game.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|It works perfectly, you do need to buy one from Audi since you pay more for nothing, it works perfectly with no interruption and no difficulty in installation.
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is fun, fast-paced and addictive. It works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire. The only downsides is that sometimes it gets laggy and it causes problems, and it doesn't want to work reliably well on my phone (Samsung Epic 4G). But, really, awesomely fun, never boring, and the controls are usually very responsive. Great game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator that was simple to use without all the complexity of a scientific version. I found this one. Easy to use and BIG buttons.

1932907009|5.0|First, I didn't believe all the hype about Save The Cat! - That is, until I read it. The read is relatively short and to the point, entertaining, concrete and if there were only three things I have learned from this book - that is the Logline, The Board and The Beat sheet - the book has enriched my filmmaking abilities. The only small downside I found was that Mr. Snyder seems a bit arrogant for my taste, but that's just a small speck on an otherwise great book. It is not the only read, of course, and I am currently reading Syd Field's Screenplay, plan a reread of McKee's story and have the Seger book on shelf - Save the Cat is definitely one of the very important books to read on the art of screenwriting.<br /><br />Kamil Beer<br />Director/Writer
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This is a great Sudoku app with multiple versions and different challenges in it. I am sure it will take a long time to get through these puzzles. The interface is nice and quick. Great download.
1439192812|5.0|This review will be short and sweet, because I don't really feel the need to convince you to get this book due to the reviews that it already has.  However, I was so moved by this book that I feel a need to share a few details about my experience with it...  This book takes ithe subject matter to  a level that even the layperson or young adult can enjoy.  My daughter is 6 months old, and my niece is three years old, and I cannot wait until they each turn 10-12 years old, because they will receive this book (or most likely an updated edition by then) for a gift.  But don't get me wrong: This book is a treat for adults as well...I'm 41 years old, and this book gave me some great new insights on history/evolution and mthology/religion.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I have to say, I can't believe I missed this gem when it released in theaters! This film is visually beautiful, complete with great acting and an amazing soundtrack. John Carter kept my attention the whole way through and kept me on the edge of my seat during the thrilling battles. It perfectly blends action-adventure, comedy, and some romance all in a SciFi setting. I definitely recommend purchasing the Blu-Ray or at least renting it (in HD!) to experience this magnificent movie. (It really is worth checking out in HD if you can) I'm very happy that I gave this movie a chance!<br /><br />I highly recommend John Carter.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|Chronicle is a very dark, superhero-style film. The dark part of the film is Andrew's life, which is filled with abuse from school bullies and even his father; all of the abuse is presented vividly. Don't get me wrong, the film has some exhilaratingly fun scenes like when they're  flying and narrowly escape death or when they're playing around with their powers in public. I personally thought the film's ending was epic and wonderfully shot. The pacing was also very fast in my opinion. My only complaint is how fast Andrew turns into a villain and starts getting revenge; but it's a very minor complaint and it's actually awesome when he finally snaps. The film uniquely spins the found footage genre for the better. Ultimately, it's unique, it's well acted, it's dark, and it's entertaining. Definitely worth the $12.99 I paid.<br /><br />(Review of the Director's Cut)

But over all its great game definetly worth every cent I paid!

1440503257|4.0|The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook has some very fun recipes.  Many of the recipes are just traditional British fare, while others are actual dishes mentioned in or alluded to in the series.  I really like the historical and magical excerpts that go with each recipe.  It's quite fun!<br /><br />The recipes are easy to follow; nothing in the book is too terribly difficult to produce.<br /><br />A good addition to any HP-crazed cook's collection. :)
B007FH9GT2|1.0|I am a latecomer to this whole 'DRAGON TATTOO' thing. I ignored the book when I saw it in the library, I ignored the DVD's when I saw them at Blockbuster. I only became intrigued when I saw the Daniel Craig version advertised on TV. I never had time to see it at the movies, so I have been waiting for it to come to pay-per-view or HBO. In the meantime, BluRay disc player and Netflix and Amazon happenned. I noticed it on Netflix first, thought it was the American version, and instead started watching the original Swedish movie. I was hooked. On Netflix I watched the three original extended movies, all 9 hours of them. Then I took the audio books out of the library, and listened so far to 35 of the 44 CD's. Then I watched this American version with Daniel Craig. Right from the credits, with extreme oily CGI graphics and ear-splitting Led Zeppelin music from 40 years ago I knew there was trouble. Almost nothing in this American version works. Somehow they drained the life out of this amazing story. All of the actors are miscast, the soundtrack is awful, the settings are wrong, and the story is re-written so confusingly that even I couldn't make sense of it, and I already know the story. Some of my immediate pet peeves are non-Swedish actors playing non-Swedish characters in a Swedish story set in Sweden. A soundtrack that employs annoying buzzing and droning sounds that obscure the dialogue. Photographs and scenes that aren't even nearly as beautiful as the Swedish version. Changing the ending so that it is not like the book, not like the Swedish film, and worse than both. Changing the main chemistry between the two main characters which is the focal point of the story. The Amazon instant-view video that I watched on my Vizio TV thru my Vizio BluRay disc player developed a glitch near the end, which looked like slight slo-motion. It ruined the experience. All 9 hours of the Swedish films played flawlessly thru Netflix. To sum up... I feel bad that some people will watch this American version and turn off to a great story. The original book is highly textured, and even though it is extremely detailed and wordy, the detail is interesting. I recommend seeing the Swedish film first ( even the whole 9 hours of the extended Swedish films), then read or listen to the book(s). Then watch the Swedish films again. There is detail within detail, even more and better than something like LordOfTheRings. The Swedish actors will help you picture the characters, places, and history. If you watch the subtitled movies, you get to hear the actors voices and the wonderful sound of the language. This is a story about abuse by individuals and the system, overcoming abuse through strength, wits, trust and love. It is bittersweet and powerful. Since writing this I have watched the Daniel Craig version again, and then I re-watched the Swedish films. Yes, they are that GOOD!this American version and turn off to a great story.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I loved this game at first. But after a while U get bored. Other than that it was wonderful. Thanks for making a good free game.
B005HERAPC|2.0|A very limp finale to season 2, mostly footage from earlier episodes in \\"flashback\\" form.<br /><br />The premise (something attacking Riker's CNS) is a bit weak, but the execution tells me that when season 2 was produced, they either ran out of money at the end, or ratings were weak enough to need to recap \\"highlights\\" before season 3.  Maybe the recap format made more sense when broadcast was the norm, and Tivo didn't exist.<br /><br />(Rewatching all of ST:TNG with the GF, in sequence, years after seeing them sporadically when they first aired)

B005HER26Y|5.0|An exciting season opener (much better than season2's limp finale).  Rough times for the Enterprise, and Wesley is shown to be less infallible than usual.<br /><br />On the negative, Dr Pulaski is replaced by season1's Dr Crusher-- Pulaski seemed to be a better fit for the cantankerous-doctor role.  A top federation scientist is (as typical in ST) a bit of a meglomaniac.<br /><br />Rewatching all of ST:TNG with the GF in sequence, years after seeing them sporadically when they first aired.

B004XXIHS2|4.0|While today's young adults will chuckle about plot points such as woman needing to signout from her dorm for the weekend and being furtive to avoid the attentions of the house-mother, such things are necessary for what now clearly reflects the era in which it was written.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plotting of the first third of the story the best (\\"Dorrie\\"), I found the Ellen piece very suspenseful -- I was literally on the edge of my seat.  Then part three, I couldn't get into Marion at all.  But the final showdown makes it worthwhile, especially when we get back to the internal dialog of our creepy antagonist.  Levin has the sociopath down cold for sure.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So being an actual submissive most of this book annoyed the life out of me. A friend suggested these books to me(knowing my preferences). So I picked it up. Sweet lord, if I had known this was Twilight (minus the vampires and throw in some S & M) I would have most likely NOT have read it. Over all the whole plot and story line was EXTREMELY lacking. I never felt like we truly built up to anything worthwhile. Everything got solved SOOOO quickly that is was a total let down. While I really like Chrisitan I could not stand Ana. She forced Christian to change so much of who he is. Yes, he is a full grown man who can make his own decisions, but that lousy girl never gave the WHOLE life style a really chance. She only wanted the \\"good\\" parts. Not everyone in the lifestyle has issues. Most people have healthy, happy relationships with the world, but simply enjoy a little kink. It upsets me that this book is now going to romanticizes S & M so that a bunch of sensless teen and twenty somethings will go out looking for this kind of ridiculous situation.

B0086700CM|2.0|I really enjoy this game on other platforms, but the lag on the fire makes it really difficult to do well. It doesn't register your jumps and ducks in time and you end up dying. Very frustrating.
B0077SGMXM|3.0|This app is available in a later version (2.0) in the Google Play store for free. Hard to see why it would normally be $2.99 when it's free elsewhere. Plus, I prefer apps that don't need the amazon app store installed to function.  Just saying. Otherwise, I'd give the app 4 stars, one removed due to the in app cash purchases.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|In turn: twisty, amusing and fun. I greatly enjoyed it! Unlike other Sherlock Holmes takes, this film emphasizes Sherlock Holmes' training in martial arts and other forms of defense. It is less cerebral and more action packed. I think it is actually truer to the stories than others I have seen. Both RobertDJ and Jude Law are great in these roles. I really enjoyed this.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is pretty easy to get the hang of. Even though I know what I'm doing I still suck at it which makes it really addicting! Definitely worth the download...
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever I recommend it to everyone the challenges. THe popularity how it spread like wildfire this game is awesome
1434404374|5.0|She wasn't a Dame of the British Empire or the Queen of Crime when \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" was written in 1917. She was simply Agatha Miller Christie (1890-1976) whose book was not published until 1920 by the Bodley Head Press in Great Britain. The book is in the \\"cozy crime\\" genteel genre of British detective fiction which came to the fore in the between war years \\"the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.\\"<br />  The Plot: Captain Arthur Hastings (a good friend of Poirot he resembles Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes works) is recuperating in Essex from injuries sustained in World War I. He visits John Cavendish an old chum of his from public school days. Soon after his arrival, Hastings learns of the murder by poison of Cavendish's stepmother. She had recently married an adventurer by the name of Alfred Inglethorpe. Among the suspects of her murder are John and and his brother Lawrence (he has practiced medicine in th past); Mary Cavendish the unhappy wife of John; Cynthia Murdoch a young relative of old Mrs. Inglethorpe and and Dr. Bauerstein a German born physician.  No one is able to solve the crime until the arrival of Monsieur Hercule Poirot a Belgian refugee from German aggresion. The novel follows a pattern Christie was often to use in turning out her novels. A closed room in which the victim is found; poison as the means of murder and a restricted group of suspects who come from upper class backgrounds.<br />  The novel is a fun perusal as the reader matches wits with Hercule Poiort and his \\"little grey cells.\\" The book is a great introduction to Agatha Christie. This is a fine novel of detection and crime. Enjoy it for a fun read!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Although I also herd about how bad it did at the box office and the critics reviews were critical.  I found nothing wrong with this movie it was spectacular in concept and in story telling.  Incredible movie I hope there is another one in the works but i doubt it.
0307719219|2.0|I agree with most of the other negative reviews I have read here.I think the thesis presented is interesting and probably has an element of truth to it.  That being said, I cannot give this book an overall good review.  Since many of the other reviews have pointed out so many of the flaws that I agree with, I won't repeat those (except for one).  As a professional historian, I will add only two comments, one a repetition of something another reviewer said (worth repeating because I find that it says so much about this book, what it lacks, and what it's purposes seem to be), and another that I haven't read here that I think is necessary.  First, I find it amazing and suspicious that the authors seem to have either no concern and/or interest in exploring \\"extractive\\" institutions in our very own current society. Let's see...as an example....um...maybe the financial services industry!!! Second, a much better and also recent book on this huge subject is, \\"Why the West Rules: For Now\\" by Ian Morris.  Unlike the \\"hedgehog\\" (God bless Isaiah Berlin! :))nature of this book, Morris, though he has a pretty clear thesis, does try to synthesize a number of possible explanations in with it (while maintaining criticisms of some of these theories).  For instance, he does not reject geographical explanations out of hand, but incorporates them in a way that makes them one part of a larger explanation of why some nations are wealthy and some are not. So Morris includes geography without strawman arguments against it, but in a nuanced and complex way that makes geography only part of the story.  This approach is much more scholarly and objective (and the book is highly readable, by the way), and by incorporating many of the other theses on this subject in order to promote his own, he shows himself much more of a \\"fox\\", in the best way possible.  Also, for what it's worth, Morris is both a historian and archaeologist from Stanford, specific credentials more conducive to this subject than the authors' in question here.  In a nutshell, read \\"Why the West Rules: For Now\\" if you want a much more plausible, fair-minded, objective, and interesting examination of this subject and skip \\"Why Nations Fail\\" (I wish I had read only the former and not both...I can't get those hours back!) -- Christian Jardine
B005LAIGWS|3.0|I found this to be disappointing.  The acting was great but lacked something in the script that made the fist Ghost Rider a hit.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Great game. I can't believe it is free! It is like Super Mario Bros, but you can also shoot acorns at the bad guys.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|There was nothing off about this movie everyone did a fantastic job as far as acting. The script was great bravo
B007JRU2UK|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Basic plot could have adapted for almost anywhere, but we enjoyed the Hawaiian atmosphere for it's realism.  Lived there most of our adult lives and appreciated the authentic background. Familiar surroundings.  Nice to see mildew on the walls/fences rather than a Hollywood clean up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun to play and easy to get started ... I'm playing on a Kindle Fire and no problems.  I'll probably play on my pc as well eventually.
B0086700CM|4.0|I loved the game when I first got it, but it started lagging all of a sudden. It jumps, freezes, and sometimes the screen distorts. If they fix that, it'll be great again.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not a great work of literature.  If there were multiple categories for star ratings, quality of writing would receive one star.  Entertainment factor would receive 4.5 and steaminess 3.5 stars.<br /><br />I read the trilogy non stop in four days.  Disappointed with the repetitive prose and the author's apparent refusal to use a thesaurus.  But still I read on.  Obsessively.<br /><br />The kink factor is relative to the audience.  For some it will be down right shocking, while for others more learned on the subject of BDSM, it will be light fare.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is a 21 year old who ends up on the ride of a lifetime.  Go with her and lose yourself in the fantasy......just enjoy the story.
0385341008|5.0|This was a delightful and insightful read.  My husband will now have to come up with a trip to the Channel Islands for me.  I would love to meet all the wonderful characters from the book but alas they are fiction. The story being told by a series of letters made it become personal.  The people were real and I felt they were sharing themselves with me.  The history of the islands during World War II was of great interest to me.  They endured so much but they supported and cared for each other.  Sending their children away for four years must have been a difficult decision for families to make, though I must admit to wanting to send mine away for their teenage years.  The story also gave some insight to the German soldiers and though we viewed them as the enemy many of them were just enlisted men doing what their country ordered. Our book club read and discussed this and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0086700CM|5.0|it took a while to download but once it did I could not put it down.I literly played for 2 hours strait. it is a great game for all ages and is simple but really addicting. best game ever!!!!!!!!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|the kids love this game and now love playing with the groceries. They love Fizzy and the little bag of chips!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy this game finaly came out for thd kindel fire i love it. Now i am waiting for the real jetpack joyride.
0345803485|5.0|This book is an easy and addicting read. It may make you blush at times but it is fun to read.
B00030590I|1.0|Haiku<br /><br />Very high ratings<br />For a terrible movie.<br />Many critics suck.<br /><br />I have never been so baffled by so many boffo reviews. This movie is essentially an exercise in art house cliches. Movie-goers will look back on this phenomenon years from now and scratch their heads in amazement.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|WOW! What an album. Best in Years. I love the fact that Mr Peart Has laid back and got comfortable. The recording is ok. A bit muddled. I think The Garden is the shocker on the whole album. Rush? A ballad? Fantastic. Even the wife loved it. Way to go Boys. See you in Brooklyn and Jersey in October.
B004LROMQG|5.0|I'm really enjoying the direction they're headed with this series. Season three spends a lot of time revealing new depths to each character, and it was time well-spent. Uther's story in particular is taking some interesting turns. We learn more about his past and find him to be so much more complex than the simple tyrant we met at the beginning of Season one. Arthur is forging ahead towards becoming the great king we all know is coming (although there is still plenty of good-natured/immature ribbing going on between him and Merlin!). It's also a treat to see the beginning of the Round Table, as well as the old and new friends that accompany it. My one complaint is that Morgana turns out to be a rather incompetent villain. Oh yes, great ambitious deeds of evil are accomplished, but one gets the feeling that without Morgause, Morgana would have to settle for sitting around glaring at people instead of actually doing anything. Ah well, I guess the poor girl has to learn some time. That aside, it's an excellent season, with great stories, some clever surprises, and of course, more of the epic bromance that is Arthur and Merlin.
B00846REIS|2.0|I'm sorry but this book is nothing to write home about. All the author did was change the characters names in 50 Shades of Grey and publish the same book again. I wish I could get my money back.
B0077SGMXM|2.0|I won't even go on about the actual game, which is quite decent.  The fact that this is a paid app that has a cash shop?  Sorry, cash shop games should be free.  Ironically, this is Free App of the Day.<br /><br />Sell the game for $5 or $10, but keep the accessory charges out of the game, or make it free.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with wanting to get paid or to make a profit but be careful with that greedy part.
B0086700CM|5.0|what can I say everybody likes this game and I do to! I'm so happy it is out on the kindle fire. it works great.
B0008237BY|5.0|This is the third time I have bought this album!<br />3 x 5 stars = 15 STARS!!!<br /><br />Thug Life, what more needs to be said?
B0086700CM|5.0|love it it is awesome you have to play it it is the best game ever made not the best game ever made some what in the range some people may not like it at all I think it is a good games not for 1-4 or 5 but it is a good game 6-100 my dad likes to play it even love lexi :)
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|hangs often. the little pencil goes round and round for minutes. fun otherwise. like that you get to watch your own drawing guessed
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not really giving just this first of three books 5 stars... I'm giving the trilogy a 5-star rating altogether.  The book was recommended to me by a young woman at work who mentioned that her father (my age) had \\"borrowed\\" the book from her and wouldn't give it back.  Now this intrigued me, because this is a very bright, articulate girl, and so I had to assume her father was likely no intellectual slouch either.  I also found it curious that a YA-rated book would get this level of accolade from a more mature crowd... so I decided to give it a try.  Wow.  I read copiously, and yet SELDOM do I ever make the statement that \\"I couldn't put it down\\" or that \\"I read until 4am\\".  I made both those statements while reading these 3 books.  Brilliantly-drawn characters with great depth; it was easy to become caught up in the drama in each of their lives.  Even the \\"2nd-string\\" characters -- like the community families, etc -- were developed enough that you remembered them throughout the entire ordeal.  If anything, the author drew the lead characters with almost TOO MUCH maturity for their ages (just the opposite of my remarks on the horrible trilogy of Natusch's that I just reviewed).  Intriguing plot, snappy dialogue, plenty of action... the author did seem to run out of steam a bit at the end, but it's completely forgiveable, given the whirlwind pace maintained throughout the first 2 books.  Ms. Collins is definitely an author on whom to keep your eye... which certainly shouldn't be too difficult to do with the acclaim she's garnering (and the movie recently released) with this superb offering.  Can't wait to read more!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|and big. this is my go-to calculator. why is there this stupid 20-word min. why why why why why why
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have in the past used the free version which is more of a demo of this product in my opinion rather as a stand alone product that helps you with battery monitoring.  For excellent features to help keep your Kindle Fire well charged and monitored you need to buy the PRO VERSION which is very inexenspivey Also since the app has Android compatibility it would infinitely useful on Android smartphones as well.  It has plenty of features. to make its battery monitering for any Android compatible worth a meagerly $2.00 sum!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|its really a lot of fun and its one of my faveorite games now its really worth the price there are also 60+ levels in the full version
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. wish it was available on the kindle sooner. also the designers need to add more words. I've gotten a lot of duplicates.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Outstanding movie that did keep me on the edge of my seat!  Arrived fast and in perfect condition too!  Recommend this exclusively to all you movie buffs!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is a great game and it deserves five stars. Wonderful graphics, fluid motion, unique environments and abilities make this game a must have.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is just the  coolest app! You can get for free. Just awesome Fun for all ages.  I am still trying to master this.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not sure what to say? Same dialogue and setting every 10 pages. Silly. Boring. Stupid. Could have told this story in 50 pages. not 3 books!
B007KAJG3K|4.0|I purchased the 1 disc version, because a sticker on the outside cover stated \\"Watch In Maximum Movie Mode\\". However, the 1 disc version DOES NOT contain the maximum movie mode feature! If you care about such features, make sure you get the 2 disc version. Also, you apparently need the 2 disc version to use the free iPad app that syncs with the movie. That being said, I really enjoyed the film, maybe even more so than the first. Noomie Rapace (Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) plays a wonderful part in this movie. My only complaint is, these films lean more towards adventure and less to mystery. I suppose that's why they appeal to a much larger audience. Anyway, a fun and highly recommended watch!
032147404X|5.0|I have the whole series. Love his books!! Simple and to the point. These books started my photography career. Highly recommended to anyone interested in photography.
1577314808|5.0|I am a very logical guy, so reading this book was very difficult for me due to the very spiritual nature of the content.  However, I persisted and am glad I did.  The author's lessons make perfect sense and I have found a greater pleasure with life from applying them.  Live in the now, and don't think.  Just read this book.
0765316994|5.0|This is a terrific novel, especially if you come at it for what it is -- a send-up of  bad television -- as opposed to what it's not -- \\"hopefully the mirror image of [some other John Scalzi novel] I read before.\\" It's an entirely new take on the fictional-characters-whose-lives-are-screwed-up-by-writers genre, smarter than most about the world of SF fandom and the havoc it wreaks. This is very funny, while still providing a strong set of characters who struggle against the world around them. And, unlike some, I really enjoyed the codas, all three of them, and didn't feel until the last page of the last one that the novel had been brought to a fitting conclustion. Great work.
1612130283|1.0|I'd heard so much about this book that I had to pick up a copy for myself to check out. Now that I've read up to chapter twenty-four, it's clear to me this isn't going anywhere. To me, it's almost as bad as \\"Twilight\\". You have a multi-billionaire who's way too perfect. He's a mary-sue, the perfect character that can say or do anything and it happens. She's been heading up the mary-sue alley for a while. Why is she always whispering? Or murmuring? In fact, everybody seems to be doing that. It's like the author couldn't think of another word to use at the time. Then you have the sex scenes. Okay, I was curious about these, and that's why I wanted to read it. But they're ridiculous! This is obviously written just for the kinky love scenes. But who has sex on the whelm, on any object they want, and then walk away as though nothing happened? I know what makes a good story. This isn't one of them. In fact, there just doesn't seem to be any story at all. There's no opposition, no one to stop them. The antagonist is their feelings for one another. Even their parents are all for it! What gives? And the girl's roommate just so happens to hook up with Mr. Perfect's brother? Wow! What a coincidence!  The guy never works, just has sex and emails throughout the story to his girl. How did he get so rich? It's magic! We don't even know what his business does, or why he has all these blonds working for him. And no one knows his secret kinky love life. My guess for the ending, since the story seems to revolve around her signing this contract in order to do the Dominant/Submissive thing, is she'll ho around with him until her \\"inner goddess\\" decides to quit \\"hiding under a blanket on the sofa\\" and gives completely in and signs the contract. Then in book two, they'll do their bondage voo-doo, and in book three they'll get married and bang each other up and down the elevator while everyone watches the security camera and murmurs to each other how perfect the couple are together!
B007SGM084|1.0|This book is NOT worth the time it takes to turn on my Kindle!! Poor story line to say the least. The writer really needs to stop writing if this is the best she can do. Even after the first couple of chapters I thought \\"why is she repeating herself all the time\\" like she has a few phrases that she repeats every other page \\"oh my\\" very sexual..but very boring...don't waste your time or money on this rag!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I thought the app was very well made and contained many puzzles for entertainment. Plus, it was free so that made it even better. (:
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going Nuts is addictive. Good combination of graphics, game play and interesting music combine to make this hard to put down.
B0058VW36U|1.0|too expensive for.my budget  im to poor to purchase this app all of tbe apps on my kindle are free to bad fornme that my parents cant afford it thank you for your time
B007X16GFC|2.0|This movie couldnt decide if it wanted to be a slick heist movie or a gritty drug trafficing film.  It balances itself between the 2 for much of the movie.  There are a few points that seem to give rise to brilliance, but most of those are quickly tossed under the rug by standard cliches of drug, police and action movies.<br />This movie offers nothing that you haven't seen before.  Its a fine action flick to watch if you want to pass the time for a $1 redbox rental, but purchasing should be kept to marky mark fans exclusivley.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The above comment isn't of a derogatory nature.....no, not at all!! I'm still trying to figure out what just hit me, and see if I can put into words how great this CD is. This CD arrived in my mailbox yesterday, and I immediately opened it and passively listened it at dinner with the kids. Of course, I was 'hearing' it rather than 'listening' to it for that hour or so. In an almost reckless fashion, I had 3 stars in mind if I was going to make the mistake of reviewing it quickly. Instead, me and the kids took a road trip today, and I was able to really focus on the songs while driving, and conclude that I was listening to the best Rush album since Moving Pictures, and I'm confident with that assessment. I say this because this album shows what patience and careful craftsmanship can do; the songs are 'tight' (very little deviation in sound from one to the next, which is common for concept albums) and very robust, especially the song HEADLONG FLIGHT, which may be Neil Peart's best work since TOM SAWYER. While melodies don't initially jump out of these songs, they are nonetheless there and aren't indulgent. Basically, these songs have that 'movement' to them, and tell a great story amid the fast and sometimes furious tempo. Geddy Lee has his bass thumping more than ever, and Neil has the energy of a 20 year old, while Alex and his guitars are having the time of their lives. The standout tracks: every track. The REAL standout tracks: CARAVAN, BU2B, THE WRECKERS, HEADLONG FLIGHT, and THE GARDEN. The latter is a heartfelt slower song that has the listener rooting for these guys and admiring their talent and versatility. THE WRECKERS has an addictive melody (the only exception on this album). All of the tracks have that 'feel' to them, and have me shaking my head and concluding that these guys have reached full maturation, and not losing a thing, but rather gaining momentum. I think that this trio is just trying to have fun these days, and it's showing up in the songs; that is, the quality of them are high, and the fact that they're taking their time between albums these days is another huge reason for my predicted success of this album. I think this album will go platinum, which hasn't happened in a while. I will not attribute bigger advertising for the success, but rather word of mouth in how good this album is. And finally.......it's time to tell the harsh critics of Rush \\"enough is enough\\" and perhaps they will finally give credit where credit is due and first  acknowledge how great this album is, then realize that Rush has influenced so many bands who are already in the Hall. I'm sure Metallica (big Rush fans) have already listened to this album, and think that this album is stellar, and Rolling Stone will have to come forth and fess up that they've done a great disservice to this band for too long. Do yourself a favor and get this CD; you won't be sorry. P.S. I heard some small parts of songs that sound like Bastille Day, Hemispheres (The Sphere), Losing It, and La Villa Strangiato.t is, the quality of them are high, and the fact that they're taking their time between albums these days is another huge reason for my predicted success of this album.

B007Z9R69M|4.0|as this movie opens up it seems to be nothing interesting.  as a man and woman converse in a forest road diner.  suddenly one of the most intense fight scenes that I can recall in recent years breaks out.  The movie doesnt slow up much over the next 1.5 hours.<br />The movie seems like a low budget flick, but the action sequences and the camera work clearly seperate it.
1439181780|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who had read it, and from what she said, I knew I had to buy it and read it also. It's an amazing book, very helpful for making changes and letting old patterns in your life go. I highly recommend it for anyone on a positive journey of their life.
0061122416|5.0|Because I was so intent on reading this book through to the end, I didn't let the fact that it wasn't what I was used to deter me. After a while, I started to be increasingly fascinated with what the character was going through and how the book was written. I loved it until the end. Amazing. Everyone with a dream should read this book. Everyone without a dream should read this book, maybe you'll find yours.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|enjoying it so far. Its the kind of game I usually her into and remember playing the computergame many moons ago
B0086700CM|5.0|A great way to pass some time...simple and fun. The graphics are nice and plenty of goals to reach for.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is the most exciting book ever!<br />I have read several books about equal content but this book really gets you in the story and u don't let the book go. I spent hours reading fifty shades nonstop.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album rocks!  I love the opening track. This album gives you what I've always referred to as the Rush atmosphere that has been missing on recent albums.  If you are a Rush fan, you will not be disappointed.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I am a big Bonnie Raitt fan and have listened to this album at least twenty times without growing tired of hearing it. I highly recommend the album. You will not get a good idea of the quality of the songs by listening to the short snippets in the previews. Some of the songs, while being different, remind me of the two outstanding albums, Nick of Time and Luck of the Draw.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I am a Paramedic &amp; 911 Dispatcher so needless to say, I have a ton of stress &amp; sleepless nights. Over time, (13 yrs now) my erratic sleep patterns from shift work have made it almost impossible for me to fall asleep at home and even when I do, I never sleep thrum the night... ever... Until these past few nights. I purchased the Sleepy Time app and used the rain + thunderstorm sounds. I think I may have gotten more uninterrupted sleep these past few days than I have since I started my career! Thank you!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun and entertaining game. I like the fact that there is no energy to burn. You can play continuously.
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|Wow! Great insight into this Lady's life. I'm not sure what all the criticism is about... I was blown away by both the story and the way it was told. Beautifully shot, acted, directed - the best movie since \\"The King's Speech\\".
B0086700CM|4.0|I have always seen my friends play this game on their iphones or ipod and have always wanted to play it. I was so happy when it came out on the kindle fire. the thing though is sometimes it freezes.
030758836X|4.0|I am a big fan of Gillian Flynn, having read and loved her first two novels. She does not disappoint this time. You probably have already heard about the plot, which revolves around the strange disappearance of Amy Dunne on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary to Nick. There is no need to give more plot detail as that will spoil the twists and turns.  The writing is excellent and engaging.  Flynn continues to explore the darker side of humanity, although I did not find this book as wrenching and disturbing as her first two. But there is plenty of nasty stuff in here, don't worry!<br /><br />This is a great read and definitely recommended. I am already looking forward to her next book.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The Hunger Games<br />I just got back from seeing this film. I was eager to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Was it all glitz and glitter? Not by a long shot. About the only part of the movie that showed a lot of investment was showing the \\"city\\" where the kids went to.<br /><br />This film is more or less a test of survival. Our young heroine comes through with a few injuries, and her \\"partner\\" from District Twelve also makes it out OK due to their willingness, or acting, to commit suicide instead of one of them having to kill the other to win the game.<br /><br />Was this movie what I thought it was going to be? Absolutely not. I figured that it would be one of those over the top full of crap movies like Avatar were the computer graphics overwhelmed the screen. Instead, it was just a damn good movie. I would have to say that it was one of the best I have seen since Star Trek came out a few years ago.<br /><br />If you are into computer graphics and think a movie is nothing without them, don't go see this film as it doesn't seem to have much in that area at all. But, if you just want to see a really good movie, you need to see this one.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Hunger Games, and I would not hesitate to see it again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the show and being able to download direct to my Kindle Fire made the experience a pleasure.  I would have never gone to a store to buy a DVD.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|a very readable book that is especially good if you're  preparing for job interviews and case competitions. Many of my friends on the master's program in finance also purchased this book and are very happy with it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting and its really hard for me to get addicted to a game. I know you like it from the first time you play:)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great item big numbers and easy to use and read. Glad I down loaded it. Like the fact that it runs your figures underneath.

B007L96VCY|5.0|'Ram' is an astonishment. Considering the brilliance of music during the early '70s by the like of Carole King & Elton John (+ Messrs. Harrison & Lennon), 'Ram' creates its own genre of magic. The tone, mood, & feel of the songs unify to present Paul building upon the 'McCartney' album to new heights. Despite the co-credit of ownership, the voice of the record is definitely Paul's although Linda's harmonies do shine in songs such as 'Dear Boy' & 'Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey'. Shades of the past sonically appear in the horns of 'Long-Haired Lady' (reminescent of 'Mother Nature's Son') & the reprise of the title track. McCartney's sense of strident rhythm bolsters his melodies in 'Too Many People' & 'Back Seat Of My Car' with some superb singing thrown in for good measure. The unveiled treasure with this edition lies within the drumming/percussion work of Denny Seiwell. He locks with the McCartneys so well that it is little surprise that he remained with them for some time following 'Ram'. It is the sheer variety of style that gives 'Ram' its lustre which in turn makes it unique. To consider that 'Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey' was such a huge hit mirrors musical bravery (imagine a song such as this being released now) as well as wonderful imagination that was filled with surprise and joy. Enjoy 'Ram' for everything that it is: an album that welcomes everyone with good cheer, variety, originality, and a happiness shared between the listener with Paul and Linda McCartney.

One learns why Christian is like he is..and you see how Ana is trying<br />to help him overcome his demons.The love story continues..and what a love story !!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Jamie Mcguire did very good job with the character selection. Travis and Abby are so darn cute!
0345803485|5.0|I had heard a lot about the Grey books. I purchased all three from Amazon. The first one left me eagerly awaiting the others.Christian and Ana are an amazing couple. She is introduced to a new world....one that she is very new to. Christian is dominant and controlling. To me...it is the start of a beautiful love story. You will want to read the other two.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book reminds me a lot of the 50 shades trilogy. I cannot wait until Part two. Sylvia Day did a great job writing this book
0345803507|5.0|I hated to see book three end.....I kept putting off reading the ending. One learns so much about Ana and Christian.....as their love story develops. He cares so much about Ana. After reading this book...I went back and went thru the first two books.<br />One understands more and more about each person....and things in book three...help<br />to explain certain incidents in the first two. I highly recommend this trilogy.
