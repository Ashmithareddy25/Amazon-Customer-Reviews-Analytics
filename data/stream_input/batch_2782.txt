6304806418|5.0|Alan Parker's movie-musical EVITA, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice stage show of the same name, is an epic biopic of Eva Peron, setting to music her rise to fame, prominence, and eventual first-ladyship on the arm of Argentine president Juan Peron. A woman worshipped by many and despised by as many others, Madonna plays the title role. Antonio Banderas costars opposite her as Che, a fictional (and apparently invisible) everyman who appears throughout the film playing devil's advocate to many of Eva's achievements. Character actor and theatre veteran Jonathan Pryce portrays Juan Peron, the third principal player of EVITA.<br /><br />Arguably one of Lloyd Webber's finest shows, EVITA's greatest strength lies in its wealth of excellent songs, matched to scale by Alan Parker's steady directorial hand, crafting a film whose sheer elegance meets (and perhaps even exceeds) the high bar set by the original musical. Like JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, an earlier Rice/Lloyd Webber collaboration, EVITA contains very little spoken dialogue, it is in fact almost an opera. What little dialogue exists was cowritten by Alan Parker and Oliver Stone. The toe-tapping highlights include \\"Oh, What A Circus\\", \\"Buenos Aires\\", \\"Another Suitcase In Another Hall\\", \\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\\", \\"High Flying, Adored\\", and, of course, EVITA's iconic ballad \\"Don't Cry For Me, Argentina.\\" Nabbing EVITA the 1997 Oscar for Best Original Song, \\"You Must Love Me\\", an additional tune cooked up by Rice and Lloyd Webber especially for the film, adds a tender emotional poignancy to the latter stages of Eva's saga.<br /><br />If you are reading this review and have not seen the film, your primary concerns might revolve around Madonna as Eva Peron. How could a pop star, though not often an actress, fare in such a high-profile leading role? Forgive the (totally intended) EVITA-related pun, but...she's suprisingly good. Along with a solid performance in all other respects, Madonna's vocals convey well the many sides of Eva Peron's makeup: the fragility, pain, and lingering resentments from her youth, her drive and passion to help Argentina's working classes, as well as her eyes-on-the-prize iciness and savvy skill at manipulating both herself and others in the course of her ultimate ambition. Toward the end of the film, with terminal cancer setting in and Evita's demise imminent, Madonna's performance stirred me almost to tears. Crucify me now, but I believe Madonna proves herself a better Evita than Patti LuPone. I, for one, don't miss LuPone's overtly brash, annoyingly Americanized performance. I was always partial to Elaine Page's Eva Peron in the original West End production, and I feel Madonna is more in line with my preferred take on the first lady.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas, though lesser vocalist compared to Madonna, still holds his own as a singer and delivers an overall excellent performance as Che. Both David Essex (Original West End) and Mandy Patinkin (Original Broadway) were superior in the role, but Banderas' presence does add some appreciated Hispanic representation to one of the key parts. Jonathan Pryce also provides a intriguingly ambiguous turn for what he is given. Despite it, however, Juan Peron remains nothing more than a supporting part; the primary gravity of the story stays where it should be, the conflict between Eva and Che. Though Pryce is briefly allowed to shine on his own in \\"She Is A Diamond.\\"<br /><br />I wholly recommend EVITA, a grand piece of entertainment in almost every regard, even for its handful of flaws. The most notable foible is the loss of some of the original musical's bite, with a fair few of Tim Rice's more provocative lyrics (the ones deemed too critical or unflattering toward Eva Peron) either toned down or removed completely in the translation from stage to screen. While still not afraid to lift the curtain on Eva's negative qualities, the film will seem noticeably neutered to any fans of, say, the originalBroadway production and its accompanying cast recording. Viewers who do not count themselves among the purists will most likely not be bothered by the changes, for the musical's essence, and the political angle of its two creators, remains largely intact. These revisions were probably made as part of a deal allowing Alan Parker, his cast, and the crew into Argentina in pursuit of authentic locales. This seems to me a fair trade off, especially for their ability to shoot the crucial scene of Eva addressing scores of her followers from the balcony of the actual Casa Rosada. Another significant change which benefits the film version: the reeinstatement of \\"The Lady's Got Potential\\" and the reduction of the show's weakest link, \\"The Art Of The Possible\\", to little more than a passing mention. The song is not missed at all, to be quite honest.<br /><br />To sum it all up, EVITA is a beautiful production, well worth the time of anyone who enjoys a great musical, and even more, a great story!Broadway production and its accompanying cast recording.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|Got this to sharpen the serrated parts of the knives I have and it worked very well. The construction is not the greatest, but for this price, it works as advertised.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|People tend to not give a feast for crows and a dance with dragons enough credit.  Granted a storm of swords was the best and my personal favorite in the series, but these books are great in their own right. A dance with dragons was more a set up for the coming winds of winter and a must read for a song of ice and fire fan.
1577314808|5.0|This book got me back into meditation and really helped calm all the noise in my head. However, I recommend reading it alone with no distractions.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|We love this soundtrack and we have been playing it constantly since it arrived! A great cd and we happily give it a 5 star rating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is an addicting one. Its kinda like  Temple Run. BUT BETTER!!!!!! Playing as the minions is fun. Unlocking power ups helps you get farther or get more points along the way. And when you run into other minions you get more points! Once you get enough Gru coins, you can unlock power ups or buy different costumes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game...Because I am very competitive and this releases the competition in me keep up the good word and I also forgot please make more apps.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I have this on my kindle fire and it won't let me open my messages or read posts.  I don't like it at all. Good think it was free
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a fun game that's good for passing the time. They could stand to make the items cheaper, however. The animation is pretty good, too.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Only one word can describe this story: Life. What a beautiful slice of humanity. So sad to see it end.
B009YMMEVI|5.0|I love Steve Martin, Jack Black, and Owen Wilson... Do when they team up and compete to do a big year... Trying to see the most birds in one year... Well, the comedic play of this movie is charming.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|When you try to purchase in game tokens they do not get credited to your account, they sure take your money though!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is amazing. Its so easy to figure out if u use alot of emoji. This game is awesome
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I had not really listened to Vince Gill play guitar until I got this album. I was amazed when I heard other music by Mr. Gill that I recognized his style and sound, Great player. Mr. Franklin plays such tasteful licks with that real country sound I can see why he is in so much demand!  I highly recommend buying this album and would love to see more collaborations (maybe with Merle Haggard and Dwight Yokam).
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Movie was directed well and did not have slow spots.  Entertaining in a superhero way.  Some nudity.  Seemed to hint at a sequel.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I don't usually rate games but I have nothing problem rating this one if it means I get rewarded. It's just that good. ;-) I think I'll download a whole bunch of G5 games and switch between all of you them till my energy goes back up. Tiny bit addicted. Can you tell?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was recommended this game, I love puzzles.  Literally could not put this down.  I also recommended this game to a friend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT BOOK I LOVED IT SO MUCH INFENTY STARS SO GOOD THIS IS SUCH A GREAT BOOK MAKE A FOURTH BOOK I NEED A FOURTH BOOK I JUST NEED MORE ALOT MORE MORE MORE MORE I NEED MORE
B008JFUO4U|5.0|A great futuristic apocalyptically movie.  Very good story line and lots of action to keep you involved in the movie.  There's several story lines to follow and it keeps you going till the end.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I have enjoyed Lee Child and &#34;Jack&#34;, but this wasn't as entertaining as previous books in the series. Not bad, but not his best work.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I really didn't get what everybody was raving about in this book. I felt it was badly written and really corny, maybe my sex life is exciting enough !!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter has just been one of those creative series that I've really been able to get into.  Season 7 was action packed...Can't say what I liked best or I might ruin the storyline for you.  Big surprises in this lead-in to the final season.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|A great human drama of a man and the demons in a bottle.  Denzel really plays the part well and tho he does have problems to overcome he comes through a hero (of sorts)
159420411X|5.0|Silver has a very readable style...even when elaborating on Bayes theorem (and how it can explain likelihood of your mate cheating on you). Signal hits on many meaningful events of our time including the Great Recession, major hurricanes, politics, and sport. This context makes the math interesting--which many teachers would be well served to pay attention to. Full disclosure: I was a math major but I think Signal is good for any curious reader that seeks to understand why it is useful to predict events and how human factors need to be considered to get the math right. I enjoyed it enough that I bought copies for the analysts in my team.
1439153663|5.0|Very easy to read, very hard to put down.  Filled with wonderful characters, it easily transports you back in time.  I recommend this book with 5 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great solitaire game with lots of options, including customizing the cards, Winning Deal, Random Deal, and Replay Same deal. Im play this A LOT.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Well, they definitely decided to take a different path with this one - and it was the wrong path.  They tried to make it deeper - exploring character depth, history, etc.  Are you kidding???  People don't watch 007 movies for depth and drama!  James Bond is supposed to be daring, debonair, and shallow...that one never showed up in Skyfall.<br /><br />And why the complete lack of cool gadgets?  What's 007 without over-the-top gadgets and technology?  Hopefully this is just a misstep that they won't make again.
0060254920|4.0|Simple story and nice illustrations. My only peeve is that the front dust jacket was torn in 3 places at the top ( i like my new books looking NEW).
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It's pretty much a hoarder's dream. It has EVERYTHING. And the best part is I don't have it cluttering my house.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|It's as adorable and funny as the other first 2 movies were!! A great kids movie and a wonderful family time movie!! It's funny and sweet, just like the other 2 Ice Age movies. It's a different story line with the same character's, add a few more, and still great!!!
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I understood by the other reviews that this item was not going to be very durable but I thought \\"Well I am just going to convert some cassettes and then be done with it.\\" I didn't even get that far!<br />When I removed it from the package, the Dir button simply fell off- I never touched it! Then with the first cassette I put in the chamber I pressed Play- but button would not depress. So I removed the tape & tried again- this time the button I tried to pry the button open and it fell out and cracked. Even at half price, this item is just not worth the trouble.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was a unanimous hit with our whole family (2 parents, a 12 year old boy, and a 5 year old girl). Cute, not too syrupy sweet, and fun.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game will keep you going and going on the slow days at work. Great fun game to play any where.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|DVD was great!! Nothing was wrong! This show is amazing. If you loved the other seasons, you will continue loving the seasons. So far great!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is a interesting take on &#34;Match 3&#34; games. Instead of flipping two tiles (which I really wish I could do sometimes) you slid entire rows or columns around to make matches. Then, on top of that new mechanic, you are a character running through a dungeon of some sort trying to get out. When you have combat with monsters in the dungeon by matching swords or magic staffs. Other matches also give you abilities, or items, or generally help you through the run. My first thought when I played it was sort of &#34;Meh&#34;, but then I've found myself coming back to it more and more and more.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|What can I say? It's cute, it's family friendly, and it's fun. It's endearing, and enjoyable for our family of adults, a preteen, and a preschooler.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, A Novel by Rachel Joyce is a rewarding and fun read and takes the reader into an unusual and pictorial journey toward redemption in a unique and interesting place. It's wonderfully sentimental, reflective, and real in an almost fairytale way.<br /><br />The book begins with an unlikely premise and continues in an unlikely yet credible manner, and achieves an incredible ending to a remarkable quest. After a while, reality takes a back seat to the warm fuzzy that the reader experiences as this knight-errant goes forth on his personal mission that unfolds as the book continues.<br /><br />As with don quijote de la mancha Harold plods along, sore feet, dwindling resources, and a mental communication with his guiding motivation somewhere in a convent waiting to see his face, he picks up quasi Sancho Panza followers, who without really asking; join him on his pilgrimage across England only to end up detracting from his success.<br /><br />Harold and Maude do provide a wonderful storyline with back stories and sub plots, and feeder information to carry the reader through the book and to an unexpected ending. The twists and turns are satisfying, and the word pictures of the places and things that Harold encounters are nice.<br /><br />Harold, his wife, his son, and a neighbor provide a sees saw of emotions, guilt feelings, unfulfilled needs and expectations, and the opportunity for infidelity that keeps the reader wondering when it will happen.<br /><br />I did not like the language that sneaked into the story and just exploded all over the pages. I did not think it was necessary, and I personally do not use such vulgarity and expletives in my own works.<br /><br />I did like the book, but because of the language, I cannot recommend it to just anyone, and that is a shame.<br /><br />The characters are believable and well developed as is the storyline, even though it does stretch reality just a bit.<br /><br />The ending is priceless and the reader will feel satisfied in it all. It is a heart warming telling of the best efforts of a common man to do a heroic deed even at the possible cost of his own meager life.d the reader will feel satisfied in it all. It is a heart warming telling of the best efforts of a common man to do a heroic deed even at the possible cost of his own meager life.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Since season one!! I was hooked!!!! Great action!!! Great twists!!! Walter gets more and more darker!!! It's awesome! The DVD was in great condition too!! Very happy!!
1451695195|1.0|With ALL respect to my own Christian faith i found this testimony to be a little too far out and self centered.
140006922X|5.0|I haven't read the whole book yet, but so far the most fascinating point in the book he makes is how the early Christians turned Jesus into a figure that is not concerned with earthly ambitions, but rather with the kingdom of Heaven, which would definately not be a threat to the Romans, and as such, would give early Christianity a chance to survive.<br /><br />So perceptive, so telling.<br /><br />It is a point of view that won't win over those who prefer a romantic, fairy tale belief.<br /><br />But we are humans after all, and the story of how religions are born are far more extraordinary than the fairy tales we create about them.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is addicting and fun.  There are a variety of puzzles to get through.  If you get stuck there is a hint button.  You also have some passes that you can earn. I found it challenging and will definitely play again as the puzzles do change.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Good movie. It's like funny but stupid, but stupid to the point where it's funny. If you liked Due date, you might like this.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I consider this movie the next pivotal evolutionary point in Quentin Tarantino's career.<br />Combining everything you already know and love about QT films - strategically placed humor, gore, great actors in unexpected roles - perfectly with his recent appreciation of adapted history, makes this the best movie I've seen this year.<br />While the movie (like most of his others) is NOT historically accurate, it hardly matters with characters this complex and diverse.<br />QT's signature blasé conversations slipped into the script worked really well for Django, allowing the audience some disturbing insight on the thought-processes of slavers.<br />That being said, like Inglourious Basterds, this movie won't be for everyone. There is a ton of brutality, offensive language and things we'd prefer to remember didn't actually happen 150 odd years ago.<br />Even though there are enough historical questions marks for pretentious film snobs to turn their nose up at it, Django manages to invoke strong empathy for it's characters, and sheds light on different aspects of a time we'll never know.<br />Great casting and brilliant performances from all involved - even Jonah Hill surprised me on this one.<br />After watching Django, I can safely say my next car will be a bobble-tooth carriage!<br />Keep up the great work, Quentin!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I started playing this game when I went to visit my grandchildren it ok need a more challenging game but my grandson who is seven years old loves the game.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Where do I begin, what a great movie. It was pure genius to put in the banter between all the stars, it added that human quality. I want to thank whoever pick the stars to play their parts, an outstanding job. Could anybody else except Robert Downey Jr. be Ironman, or metal man called by Thor? Dr Bruce Banner/Hulk, outstanding role by Mark Ruffalo, Hawkeye by Jeremy Renner, handsome Thor by Chris Hemsworth, good looking Captain America by Chris Evans, beautiful Black Widow by Scarlett Johansson, deadly charmer Loki by Tom Hiddleston, and all around good guy Agent Phil Coulson by Clark Gregg. You have Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury, over S.H.I.E.L.D, a great cast all around. I notice that at times you could not hear the dialog, other than that, a great movie. Have your pop corn ready, sit back and enjoy.
B004G600A4|5.0|Wonderful kids movie!! I like the pan part!! I like the story!! I'm not a little kid but I enjoy this movie and so will kids!!!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Enjoyable game. Just doesn't give enough chips an hour to play. Trying to get hour money. Would have given it a five if it weren't for that.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is a great game and anyone who likes flow will love this game just as much.  A definite buy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it! This book is Awesome and it was extremely (I mean extremely) hard to put down. A must read...
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Excellent video and sound quality ---outstanding story, great acting, transitions were on target,<br />Clearly one of my TOP TEN DVDs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok, I totally can't put this down.  I've been fighting with my kids over this.  They can only play for 30 minutes a day, and then it's my turn to have a go (for slightly more than 30 minutes, I have to admit.)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far I like the first App.  However I haven't unlocked enough games in the second App.  I am hooked though.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Gerard Butler does it again, giving a great performance in this inspiring movie. Even if you have no care for surfing, its one of those feel good movies that I would recommend to anyone and everyone.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I really enjoyed this game mostly because I like fairy places like medieval castles. This is a really mindsqueezing game and I fought hard to find out the solutions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best game it is a great game you have to buy it toady  if you like Temple run
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I think its really cool and I like it and who ever wants a game think this should get this one
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I brought the game on the computer and it was really fun and I was thinking I wonder if this game was on my kindle fire and now I can play it anywhere
B000EDWKXS|5.0|well I love movies like this with a extended versions on dvd. I have a collection full of dvds and this is my 3rd movie along with crimson tide and enemy of the state that were release on May 16, 2006. So I really enjoyed it with cage,cusack, malkovich,and buscemi.
B00E8G5HDW|4.0|I thought season 5 wasn't too bad, it certainly was great near the end, to bad THE END is what it was.  The middle four episodes focusing on the droids was totally crap.  The first episode aired on Dec 1st, 2012 and we had to wait until Jan 19th, 2013 for a great episode with Darth Maul in it.  They only did this because they had to ramp up production on the great episodes with all the characters and needed filler.  On top of this, we find out that R2-D2 can survive the largest explosion ever produced on The Clone Wars series and he was basically sitting on top of the center of the explosion.  Yes, I know it's all make believe, and that was a great cliff hanger going into a commercial, but COME ON.  They jumped the shark on that one.  I think they had to rush the story with Ahsoka, it was entirely too predictable, I could tell what the plot line was and who the bad guy was entirely from the commercials.  So yeah, Season 5?  Meh.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I liked the old version a little better, information was easier to get . Now there are extra steps. If its not broken dont fix it .  Anyway I'll give the new version ａ try .
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book written by Death about death and life and the survival of the human spirit despite all odds. It's not a book to exactly enjoy, but a book to remember with memories to treasure and lessons for living.  Discover it. You won't be sorry; you will be glad ... In a perverse sort of way.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Just bought app so I'm sure I can't go wrong with a weather app. Bought weather apps before and I didn't like them. I like the background scenes especially.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|First off - this is now my favorite biz book hands down.  Second, this so resonated with me in my current role that I was dumbstruck reading this book with each and every page - I kept saying to myself &#34;I know these people, I work with them, and I have dealt with this day to day!!&#34; - I have now begun a campaign to get as many in my firm to read this book as possible, it simply is that good.<br /><br />What is the most powerful aspect of this book is that one of the authors, Gene Kim, speaks from experience.  His former role as CTO gives him a credibility and accuracy with respect to his insights which then speak to those who live the DevOps duality (as I like to see it) - one the one hand you have a group guided by structure, predictability, risk avoidance, and process; pitted against them are their &#34;other halves&#34; who are guided by agility, speed, tolerance for failure, and risk takers - The Phoenix Project illustrates a way to get them to coincide harmoniously!!<br /><br />This book represents more of a &#34;technotherapy&#34; approach to getting each side to open up and communicate (sounds like relationship counseling to me) and that truly is the thrust of what is needed to drive a successful DevOps culture!!  The three pillars of tech mgmt: People, Process, Tech, are always present, but it is People that, in the end, make things happen and thus, with people, we must nurture a cultural and environment that houses two nearly diametrically opposed personalities.  This is not easy and is the source of many mgrs frustrations - The Phoenix Project gives great insights into how to foster these two mentalities together.<br /><br />The book is a tale of a fictitious company in the style of Eli Goldratt's &#34;The Goal&#34; (heavily cited throughout) and takes the reader on journey of discovery thru the eyes of the newly promoted CIO.  From this vantage point we are confronted with the direct mgmt issues of handling the duality of culture, the broader integration into the entire business thru interactions with C-suite, finance, sales, and even the board of directors.  Guiding our protagonist is a wise albeit kookey zen master of &#34;the way&#34; who has practiced and realized the potential of harmonizing DevOps as he evaluates the company for an open board seat. This style really gives the reader a view into every aspect of the CIOs role and &#34;awakening&#34;.<br /><br />If you are in the field, this book is for you.  If you just want to learn more about tech, this might bore you a bit, but it does provide GREAT insights.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am really enjoying. this game. ii def challenges. your. brain.it is very interesting and different. from other games I have played
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I feel that I will need a more prolific CPU later, but this is terrific for the price and all went so well.  I love how the pressure of economizing in a difficult migration (the other PC was Dell, but crumbling i7s do not a PC make).  True, it is a weak point in my &#34;windows performance experience&#34; at 6.1, but I can live with that and I guess I wont be playing RPGs or MMOs or whatnot any time soon.<br /><br />eg, I play Need for speed world and do not notice a steep drop off (+ the graphical rendering is superior)  from a i7 top-o-the-line (albeit a stinker that broke down slowly in the 70 days we kept it) with a 1GB graphics card (NVIDIA ought to be another way to express rude sounds in company:  &#34;people gawked at the banquet when Ron NVIDIAed loudly&#34;).
B0095G5AFU|1.0|When I got this app the &quot;direction&quot; for this app was  not easy to understand I figured that I should try to figure it out the next  day because I got the app before going to bed yes this may sound a bit of a lame excuse for not being able to figure out how to use the app but you think that the directions would stay in the app. So I am not happy I spent $1.99 on a app that I can't use.
B00D3XAA4M|5.0|It's a life's dream to go to all these places...<br />It combines all  - good food and wine, relaxation under the sun and cultural experiences.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I'm very disappointed in this app. Not only because I paid for it and it doesnt work but because the music timer doesn't play my music. I checked my volume and the music still won't play, yet the timer works.<br />Big. Mistake.
0399255370|5.0|Nice size, colorful, creative, and unique book. I loved watching the kids enjoy the book.  It's also an easy book for adults to ask questions that get the young ones thinking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm completely hooked to this game. Totally recommend it! Buy it NOW! How can you not love a minion game, they are so adorable! It's basically like subway surfer, but so much better.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This was for my husband and he just loves it. Especially since it was much cheaper than on Shop NBC. All that extra money just pays for the fancy box, which we don't need or use.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|too fun<br />intriguing and addictive<br />great graphics and interesting mystery. picture finds were challenging. the mystery kept me interested and wanting to solve it
1781162646|5.0|I honestly haven't read much Stephen King but when I do I am always pleased.<br /><br />The novel is told in little bite sized vignettes most of which take no longer than a few minutes to read. It was a great book to read in short clips, especially on the train. Purely a joy(land) to read.<br /><br />It is a tale of summer, lost love, love found, murder mystery, etc.<br /><br />The perfect summer book. Perfectly pulpy. Reading it was like breathing. The story telling is so natural and at times you can see King's honesty about the harshness of life peeking through (especially in the last few vignettes).<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Compare to all the runing games this one is soo cooll amd graphically excellent...full of challenges....have fun by downloading it...
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is quite an endeavor to take on ,I would suggest skimming through the historical and opinionated parts, but the story itself is worth it.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|It is very addictive.  The further you go the harder it gets and you might be on a level for several days!!!!
B001GCUER0|4.0|I'm on the tail end of Season Two and my wife and I have not been disappointed. The show picks up where it left off. Peggy has had her child, and you will be surprised how she deals with it. Is Don Draper still womanizing after his regret for not joining his family for Thanksgiving? I'm not going to spoil it for you. The people in the office still try and one-up each other, vying for attention and a hefty bonus.<br />The story lines are good (the writing has never been better), and the stories are vividly real. This upper-class society also hints at the tough-as-nails one must be to fit in with this society, and still holds true today. One of the more impactful part of this show is how well everyone dresses in the workplace. I remember the day when people traveled on planes wearing suits and dresses. Gone are those days. The fashion of the 60s was never classier!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and addictive. I would suggest it for all ages grown up and children a like.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I'm not into pop music, but this CD is just wonderful! It's enjoyable music and she's completely charming. Highly recommend.
B000002LTU|4.0|I really like jazz -- all eras -- and I like various jazz hip hop blends: Cool Bone's Brass Hop (try to find that one!), Guru's Jazzmatazz, Greyboy, Liquid Soul, Buckshot LeFunque and select Brecker Brothers tracks.  You don't have to listen too long to this music before you hear the distinct Miles Davis trumpet through mute sound.<br /><br />So, if you like this this style, how could you not try Do Bop and listen to the real Miles? Even when he occasionally muffs a riff, he brings all of the history (be bop, cool, modal, fusion, etc.) of his work in jazz with every track. No one else has ever done that or, I predict, ever will be able to do that again. He was an American Artistic Treasure who never became a nostalgia act.<br /><br />Buy it.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Every since Joe hit the scene in the early 90's, I have yet to be disappointed. With time every CD gets better and better. I have practically every cd he has ever made and with that said \\"He can serenade me ANYTIME\\" 100!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book actually lets you see the power of your own mind and thoughts! If you need to see it to believe it,these experiments are for you! Of course if you BELIEVE it you WILL see it! Pam is a great writer and I look forward to reading more!
B008JFUO4U|1.0|I preordered the BluRay disk of \\"Oblivion\\" but when it finally arrived the disk wouldn't play in my BluRay player.  The accompanying DVD disk played but not the BluRay disk.  Amazon replaced it but I got the same results on the second disk as well so rather than go to the trouble of sending it back too, I guess I'm stuck with it.  Caveat emptor.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I have no idea why this movie didn't do better in theaters. Unless of course people are just getting dimmer and can't grasp the films concept. Maybe that's why Sci-Fi in general has to try really hard to find an audience.<br /><br />Big action filled blockbusters appeal to a large audience. But, fanciful stories with emotional content that require some level of contemplation on the part of the viewer? Good luck finding a handful with the intellectual energy to track it.<br /><br />This film struck a good balance. It had brilliant special effects and the action sequences were well paced and appropriate to driving the film forward. The acting however is what made this film. Tom Cruise may be a few almonds shy of a full candy bar but good lord can that man act. His character, Jack Harper, is real, you want to relate him. I found myself ( I'm kind of a cynical person by the way) choked up at the end of the film but in a good way.<br /><br />While Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are obviously the money draw in the picture they don't overshadow the supporting cast who also do equally well in driving the picture.<br /><br />I started out renting this one. After seeing it, I know I want a copy. Rent it if you must but it's definitely worth the cost of taking up shelf space or memory on the hard drive.
B009PLKCEE|5.0|very happy using it to watch my series. Fast and it puts them in order so great.<br />keep it up.
B004LROMWU|4.0|It plays good it did pause once an then play again after pausing for a second but I had to clean the disc before it played again but now they all play really good no problem playing at all
1781162646|5.0|Not Stephen King's usual horror story but my second new favorite book of his. If you have the chance to listen to the audio book I would highly suggest it, the narrator is amazing.<br />Devin is a 21 year old college kid who goes to work at Joyland amusement park for the summer. He learns about a woman who haunts one of the rides after being killed while on the ride. After also meeting the amusement park psychic who tells him that he will meet a girl and a boy things start to get interesting.<br />Stephen King has this way about telling a story that just really draws you in, his details are always vivid, and more so with this book then some of his others, I did not want to stop listening. I stayed up very late last night and most of today listening to this book. I was anxious to start it again today and I am sad that the story is now ended.<br />This book was not released as an eBook as far as I can tell but it is well worth reading it in paperback if you can't listen to the audio book it was a terrific story.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I ususally find these games stupid, hard and confusing all rolled into one.  But this one is actualy pretty cool with a good mix of puzzles.  I reccommend it highly.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The more I made my way through this book, the more disheartened I felt.  While GRRM's world has always gritty, this book tips over into glorifying ugliness.  Seemingly every new character has \\"broken teeth\\" and/or \\"yellow skin\\" and/or boils. Horrific things happen to Brienne that made me want to cry. Other main characters have lost their way and no longer act like the people we knew in previous books.<br /><br />The real world is made up of both good and bad.  Since this is a 12-book series, I am sure that eventually our characters will get redemption arcs.  But at this point, I don't think I'll be sticking around enough to read it.
0525478817|5.0|This book was AMAZING! Every detail and word Green wrote made me fall in love with characters. This book is so much better than Green's Looking For Alaska.This is my new favorite book and i recommend it to everyone.
0062124293|5.0|I read half of the book at one sitting.  It is very well-written and entertaining, although I admit that I feel a little uncomfortable with some of her language.  Hidden in the amusing and light-hearted writing are serious well-thought-out arguments.  The discussion of how porn has changed what men expect from women (regarding shaving as well as sex) are well worth reading.  It makes me sad for my daughters who will be dating in a time where many (most?) men have grown up with modern-day porn dictating, to some extent, their ideas about sex.<br /><br />Here in the US, especially in the south where I live, feminism has a bad rap.  Moran defends feminism (of a certain type: she says we should laugh instead of being strident).  I didn't know it, but I needed to read this.  It was funny and thought-provoking.  It doesn't get much better than that!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Very detailed, long, interesting, funny, and etc. I like it, and seeing more will be good to read. Thank you
B0042U94UQ|4.0|My four year old grandson had watched after going to the movies to see Despicable me two. He was very entranced by it. Cute movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is without doubt one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read. There is no plot, no character development. It is written at a fifth grade reading level. I found the book boring. I can only think it's success lies in publishing unusual sexual tastes in a supposedly literary book.
0671578855|4.0|Originally posted at FanLit.<br /><br />I was afraid I wasn't going to like A Civil Campaign as well as the previous VORKOSIGAN novels because, according to the description, the plot takes place all on the planet Barrayar and it deals mostly with relationship issues for several of the characters. Most of the various editions of the book sport covers with couples dancing or getting married. So, yeah, I thought it was a romance novel.<br /><br />Well, A Civil Campaign is a romance novel, but because it involves the romances of Miles Vorkosigan, his clone brother Mark, and his tomcatting cousin Ivan Vorpatril, it is, thankfully, a lot more than that. Along with the romance, Bujold weaves in a few funny subplots that both entertain and advance the plot of the VORKOSIGAN series on the non-romantic fronts, too.<br />Miles' goal in this book is to convince the widow Ekaterin Vorsoisson to marry him. (We met her in Komarr.) Ekaterin's first marriage was painful and she is not inclined to repeat the experience. That's just one problem. The other is that Ekaterin is beautiful and a Vor. Since beautiful single Vor women are rare on patriarchal Barrayar (the previous generation genetically selected for boys), they are in high demand. Miles has to court Ekaterin without scaring her away while he attempts to fend off all other suitors and while he tries to maintain his dignity as an Imperial Auditor. Other romances are going on, too. Gregor's wedding is being planned by Ivan's mother. Mark is courting one of the Koudelka girls (her father is not pleased!) and Ivan has suddenly realized that while he has been happily carousing for years, all the best girls were getting snatched up.<br /><br />Meanwhile, since Aral Vorkosigan is off planet, Miles is left with his father's political duties and the counsel has to deal with a couple of inheritance disputes. One of them involves the problem of patriarchy and the other involves racism. Lois McMaster Bujold has a way of commenting on these issues using humor instead of a hammer -- it's both effective and entertaining.<br />Along with the all the romance and politics, Bujold serves up a hilarious storyline in which Mark, who now considers himself an entrepreneur, teams up with a brilliant but socially inept scientist to genetically engineer insects that vomit up a cheap and nutritious creamy substance that they hope to market to the universe. They set up a lab in Vorkosigan house and get the lovely Koudelka girls to be their lab assistants. This slapstick storyline is a little over the top, but I thought it worked well as a contrast to the politics and romance. Bujold weaves all of these plots together for a synergistic effect that's quite pleasing.<br /><br />There are some niggling little problems with A Civil Campaign, at least for me. One was that I couldn't muster up the attraction for Ekaterin that Miles seems to feel. I am not sure why he loves her -- she's kind of dull. Also, her reaction to the discovery that Miles was trying to sneakily court her was unreasonable, and his reaction to her reaction was even more unreasonable. This has to do with my second complaint which is that Miles and Mark are both in their thirties but act like they're eighteen. Miles is an Imperial Auditor, in fact -- a very distinguished position in the empire. I forgave their immaturity in previous novels because it seemed like the messes they got themselves into weren't really their faults. In this novel, though, they don't have such a good excuse... On the other hand, this juvenile behavior, which culminates in this case in a disastrous dinner party, is exactly what makes the plot so entertaining, isn't it?<br /><br />I'm listening to Grover Gardner narrate the audio version of the VORKOSIGAN saga.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Obviously, this ain't Milton or even Balducci. You won't spend hours pondering symbolism and metaphors. However, if you are a Gaiman fan and you want to spend sometime relishing in the type fantasy he excels in, you'll really enjoy this effort. The story features a progression in years of the title characture's interaction with the ancient one's (new ancient ones) involved. Gaiman uses this quite well as a mechanism to make sense of the title characture's journey thru life.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing character development. Great story. Charlie comes alive as you read, it's hard not to get lost in him, even though he is quite quirky and extravagantly different.
B007EECSFA|1.0|I have read the author's previous works. They were well written to engage the reader in the characters and to care about the plot. The Secret Keeper is very disappointing to me. I find myself skipping pages in search of interesting content. I gave up on the book half way through which is something I rarely do. The books just doesn't hold my interest enough to finish it. It's written in a flat, elementary style. Definitely not up to par and not worth spending the money to purchase.

B00C7NKPPS|5.0|One thing with Paul McCartney is he was into the live performance and he made sure Wings was at least as good as his Beatles days. The Live performance if you saw it was impressive. Never saw the Beatles live but I believe they worked at giving a professional performance and that is what Paul was all about.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|I love this movie.  Am fascinated by the creative process, Shakespeare in particular, and this movie brings him to life in a plausible way.  Gwyneth Paltrow is always a delight to watch.  Loved the plot, the romance, the dialogue. Some of it is a little bawdy, but that's what Shakespeare's era was like.<br /><br />Tom Stoppard co-wrote the screenplay. I heard Colin Firth interviewed and he said this was his favorite movie he was in.  That was before THE KING'S SPEECH so maybe he feels differently now.<br /><br />If you like Shakespeare, like a little romance, and the actors in this movie, you should enjoy the sweet alchemy in this film.  Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Joseph Fiennes, Simon Callow and Judy Dench also contributed their considerable talent to this film.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Finally, we get a movie worthy to be called Man of Steel!  I loved it..  I will grant you that the final showdown was kind of a let down, but ONLY because of what happens at the very end of the confrontation..  all the way up to that point, i thought the final fight was well done.  im not going to give more details.. you'll just have to see it yourself.  but honestly, its not THAT bad.<br /><br />and this is BY FAR the best Superman film since Superman II.  its no contest.  for one, we dont see superman window spying on Lois and he isnt lifting an entire continent of kryptonite lol.. but also, its just a well acted, well done film.  if you like DC superheroes, and are craving for an actual worthy superman film.. you wont be disappointed.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have lost so many pounds by just cutting out the wheat like the author stated.  I am healthier and feel so much better. I recommend this book for everybody who thinks they have allergies and to the people who get sick all the time like I did.  THIS WORKS!!!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Could be one of Justin's best so far. Justin's experience does not go to waste here as he continues to produce excellent music. If you like Songwriter I believe you will like this.
0812977246|5.0|Our library mystery group read this for a selection this month.  It's not an easy mystery to read, but well worth the investment of time if you like Soviet thrillers.  The author spent eight years writing this book and it shows in the quality of his craft.  Amazing characters who aren't cliches, dialogue to die for, a detective you can easily be smitten with, complex plot which pulls you along, literary writing, a brooding sense of setting and the ability to convey the absurdity of Soviet society where there is no truth, no right or wrong, and it's all mental mind games. A very gray world indeed.<br /><br />I found I could read a few chapters a night as the book isn't really linear.  You never know quite where it's going and the world is complex.  I was always fascinated to return to that world to see if Arkady the detective, a good guy, would triumph over the bad guys in the power structure.<br /><br />The book is set both in the Soviet Union, in Moscow and other Soviet cities and in New York.  The Russian detective's view of New York is quite humorous.  This mystery novel has a brilliant intellect behind it.  It felt real - I wasn't aware I was reading a book.  It felt like someone was narrating something that really happened.  You wondered if the author spent some time in Russia to soak up an intimate knowledge of it.  If he didn't, his eight years of research and writing is evident in the quality of this book.<br /><br />This was not a mainstream mystery read.  The guys in our group tended to like this book more than the women. A very original plot and novel.  5 stars plus for the craft which created this mystery novel.

B005JS7VTQ|5.0|What a bargain! The first 5 albums of the Doobs. No filler, all Killer! I f you wore out the albums when they were first released, here is a great set to replace them. Great Price for great music.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but fun. It would be helpful if the items in the inventory were labelled because sometimes the pictures are hard to identify.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I had heard all the reviews about how this wasn't very good, so I waited until I could rent it.  I found it to be a very good sci-fi movie.  Gorgeously shot.  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  Once again I found that you can't believe everything you hear until you see it for yourself.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This app is great for people with kindles because you can't type on them. I've tried many different apps and this one works better than the ones I've paid for. Beautiful app I love it!
B008JFUO36|4.0|considering that the film did not seem to get much media attention. Great effects, good acting, good directing, good production values, violence not too sickening- for me what's not to like? The script is derivitive, but i enjoyed this take on invasions, cloning, love, politics, philosophy. Warning, though, Morgan Freemans scenes are brief and Tom Cruise looks old to me for really the first time. But all in all, \\"Oblivion\\" is fun!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love this app..even my 2 year old enjoys watching me draw pictures....but as of tonight an error message pops up some thing about marmalade error?? i installed and re installed same issue still...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This shot is like crack combined with meth heroine and krokodile, the Russian drug that gets so addictive that it kills you with withdrawals, literally. I'm pretty sure if you stop playing this game it will kill you. At least it's awesomely fun too, cuz nobody wants to die bored, right?
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|To really appreciate this film one must watch in a big scree HD TV. The visuals are great plus the story is pretty good. I don't want to spoil the film so I won't say much more.
B00CWX1HPA|5.0|I knew going into buying this movie on Blu-ray it was the truncated version....most fans know that Saga of a Star World, which originally played on television in a three hour slot, is the most complete of the two....if you play the version from the series and adjust your 16X9 you get the same picture as this Blu-ray....it was widscreened to run at theaters as a movie....pretty much got it as a completest...I just finished watching the dvd (extended) version and the difference between the dvd and the Blu-ray are night and day. I wish we could get the extended version now but for the time being this will have to suffice. We all know that at some point the whole series will get released on Blu-ray...this is Universal cashing in on extra money for now....
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was pleased that the author was able to tell this amazing story and convey the fact that these highly trained individuals are proffessional operators, know they are doing the right thing for the country, and are not ashamed of that fact. It was great to see that he was able to keep political opinions to a minimum  even though that is probably a difficult thing to do.<br /><br />Thank all of you guys for your service and sacrifice. We are forever greatful.

B007NYPWS6|2.0|The acting is great (of course) and its fascinating in the way that watching someone being dismembered might be. It's good, but painful to watch.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I liked everything in it. From the packaging to the different episodes in these seasons. It's a great story with very interesting characters and very well adatped to the period in question.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is amazing and fun I enjoy learning about how old weapons were fired and reloaded.  My personal favorite weapon to reload is the Sniper or from World at War it is called the KRA3N.  It is great fun I have used the weapons to battle my brother who is using the app.  Only problem is right now is that there are only like 7 weapons to use right now.  It would be nice if they added more weapons like the Grewer and the Type 99.  Once some more are added it would be great.  Until then I shall just wait.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna is more humanoid than human on MDNA than on, say, 1998's Ray of Light, but if anyone can work an album theme to pop greatness, it's The Queen of Pop.<br /><br />The album opens with the Rave-Pop of \\"Girl Gone Wild,\\" a catchy, club-ready track. \\"I'm Addicted\\" features a hypnotic chorus and melody, which is brilliant from the first hook to the climax (when she chants \\"MDNA, MDNA/I'm addicted to your love\\"). Equally brilliant is \\"I'm a Sinner\\" produced by William Orbit (returning from Ray of Light and Music). \\"Some Girls,\\" another Orbit number, is buried in fantastic synth and electro bass.<br /><br />Madonna raps through the verses of \\"I Don't Give A\\" about the chaos of her everyday life. Nicki Minaj's rap sets itself aside from most guest vocals as she and Madonna sound like they're in unison. \\"Turn Up the Radio\\" has dark yet relatable urgency behind the lyrics: \\"I don't know how I got to this state/let me out of my cage/'cause I'm dyin'\\" though musically, it's bright Dance Pop.<br /><br />Musical brightness meeting dark lyrics is a recurring theme throughout the album. From the glossy cover to her rebellious delivery, Madonna exudes pride and strength; MDNA delivers.

B00ADQPB50|2.0|First I need to acknowledge Jessica Langes amazing performance in this disturbing/disgusting series; she deserves an Emmy, Golden Globe and whatever other awards for acting are available.  One star is for her performance and one star goes to the rest of the cast.  Much of this series I could not watch and had to keep fast forwarding through it.  It's unfortunate because of the quality of the cast and the fact that there was a seed of an important story that could have been told.<br /><br />Beyond that there is nothing more to say favorable about this series.<br /><br />  The producers, directors and writers missed an opportunity to take a higher road in the examination of mental illness (while still entertaining  us with a good scare) and chose, not only to horrify viewers , but to drag them through as much psycho-sexual gore as they could muster.  This series and its popularity (over 1,200 reviews on Amazon alone) says something about the American taste for violence, horror, torture and degradation.  We just can't seem to get enough.  Reminds me of the stories I read about the Roman empire and how much the citizens loved to watch gladiators and animals torn apart in the Colosseum.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|I tried this hoping it would turn my stock iPod adapter into a Bluetooth adapter, but the factory Mitsubishi Eclipse (and other) radio just doesn't like it.
B008OW1SAC|5.0|When I first heard Alt-J, I was shown the song Breezeblocks, probably like many others. I thought it was a pretty cool mix between modern day Indie Rock and Electronic Music. I decided to give the album a shot and listened to it. After the Intro song, I was hooked. It goes from an ambient feel and has an almost EDM-type drop with heavily distorted vocals and strong bass. The Intro track is followed by a completely A-Capella song with perfectly tuned harmonies and odd rhythms. After that, the album really just gets better. A favorite on the album is definitely \\"Bloodflood.\\" Overall, the lyrics are cryptic at times, but very easy to relate to when you \\"get\\" them. I really can appreciate the musicianship behind every song on this album, and they sound just as good live as they do recorded. One of my favorite albums that has come out in the past few years.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|This is the greatest American movie since Apocalypse Now.  Malick is a genius and an American treasure and it's a shame that the majority of Americans are too stupid to recognize the work of a higher type of person when they see it.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|First and foremost I like that this game is free but there are some things that need to be corrected. I don't know if it's just my Internet connection but when I'm in the middle of the game it'll tell me I lost my connection and boot me out the game. Not only is that annoying but you also lose the tokens that you do spent playing that round. Even if it's not my turn it'll say I took too long to play. Also, it's annoying that you have to buy tokens to freaking play a round or wait for a scratcher. They should tell you that off top. When it's not acting up though it's a fun game though.
0061950726|4.0|Two years ago I read Laura Moriarty's novel The Chaperone, about a woman who chaperoned a young Louise Brooks on a summer trip to New York City in the 1920s. As a young child, the woman was part of the orphan train, coming from New York City to Kansas to be adopted.<br /><br />I had never heard of orphan trains and was shocked to discover that 200,000 children from 1854-1929 were taken on these trains to be adopted. Many children were adopted by loving families, but many others were used as indentured servants to work farms and care for other children.<br /><br />Christina Baker Kline's novel Orphan Train shares the story of two women- Vivian and Molly. Molly is a teenage foster child, living with a couple in a small harbor town in Maine. The situation is not ideal; the woman of the house mistrusts and dislikes Molly.<br /><br />Molly steals an old copy of Jane Eyre from the library and as punishment has to do 50 hours of community service. She ends up helping 90-year-old Vivian clean out her attic.<br /><br />Molly discovers that Vivian was on the orphan train and this is where the story is strongest. Vivian and her family came over from Ireland to New York City. Her father and brothers were killed in a fire, and her sister was also believed to have perished. Her mother became mentally ill and Vivian was put on the orphan train, hoping to be adopted by loving parents.<br /><br />Vivian's story is heartbreaking and so hard to imagine. She was eight-years-old and in charge of caring for a baby boy (whom she had never met) on the train. The story is so vividly written, and Kline's thorough research adds so much to this sad tale.<br /><br />Just thinking about those children, forced to stand on a stage and be inspected by people looking at their teeth, their bones, their skin, like they were some kind of farm animal, shocked me.<br /><br />Vivian is taken in by a couple and when she arrives at their home, finds that they have several women working for them sewing clothes. Vivian is expected to join them as free labor. She sleeps on a pallet on the floor and is not sent to school as is required by the law.<br /><br />When the Depression hits, the business disappears and Vivian is sent to another family. This situation is even worse; a severely impoverished family with too many little children and not enough food. Vivian is expected to care for the children, but her saving grace is that she goes to school.<br /><br />There she meets the teacher Miss Larsen, who comes to Vivian's aid when her situation at the new place becomes intolerable. Vivian ends up at the home of a shopkeeper and his wife, where she blossoms helping the shopkeepers in their business.<br /><br />Molly's story is less intriguing, perhaps because it is more familiar to us. She begins to bond with Vivian, as they have more in common than they could have imagined.  Molly gets Vivian to open up about her past and it changes both of their lives.<br /><br />The characters in Orphan Train, particularly Vivian, Molly and Molly's boyfriend Jack (who is reading Junot Diaz in a passage) are fascinating and multi-dimensional. Vivian's story made me wish I had talked to my grandparents about what their lives were like, the things they dealt with and overcame.<br /><br />This book, like Adriana Trigiani's The Shoemaker's Wife, will make you look at your grandparents as people who had lives so different from our own. This was a strong generation.<br /><br />If you read The Chaperone, Orphan Train is a must-read for you. Anyone who like stories about strong women and historical fiction, will enjoy Orphan Train. The P.S. section at the end is also interesting, where Kline shares how she found this amazing story.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Technical aspects were as usual, well-developed. Emotional aspects were lacking. The trend in Cornwell's last few books has Scarpetta appearing too introspective and self-absorbed. Plot suffers; the story seems to focus on Scarpetta once again being targeted by jealous females and devious employees.  Hopefully the next book will find her returning to strongly developed villains unconnected to Scarpetta and tighter suspense found in earlier works.  Looking forward to a good hunt rather than a menopausal whining.

055358894X|5.0|This is the best book I have read this year and in a long time.  I had a very hard time putting it down to go to sleep at night.  If you like action and adventure, with twists and turns this book delivers.  If you like Patrick Rothfuss's \\"The Name of the Wind\\" or Joe Abercrombie's \\"The Blade itself\\" then you will like this book.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|First of all let me say the I love the gameplay in this app. I would rate that by itself 5/5 The problem is that the first day I had it it got to the quick tips screen and took 3 tries to get past it. all took at least 1 hour of waiting. if you are willing to wait get this game.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|WHAT AMAZING ADVENTURES YOU CAN UNLOCK IN THIS GAME. IT TAKES PATIENCE AND STRATEGY TO CONQUER AND COMPLETE THE MISSIONS YOU FACE.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is absolutely fantastic. It is mesmerizing and captivating along with being informative. The book was awesome. Having read the book first, I was prepared to be disappointed by the deviations movies normally take but I was not disappointed! It paralleled in direct contact with the original plot. I cannot say enough about how much I love this series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's cool and all but it gets boring after a wile but I have to say it's better on the kindle than the I phone

It has a lot of cool features that I don't use but they are neat.  Has a great radar and very detailed weather info and allows for multiple city weather checks.  Very satisfied!
1591841216|3.0|I thought I would enjoy this book. Now I think the opposite. Maybe that's the point? Not sure. Attempts to dispel some myth based thought processes but doesn't do it in any new or engaging way. Rather dull really. Not inspiring or all that informative.

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|After all these years, its such a breath of fresh air to hear Agnetha sing again. She sounds divine like always!  Highly recommend this to everyone not only ABBA & Agentha fans.

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I  thought the game was very fun, but they do have points that you use to play and once you use all your points you have to wait like 30 minutes to get more points or you could buy more points for 1.99.

B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This falls into one of the Top 100 Movies ever made. I remember seeing it when it was first released in the 1984 and loved it. When I watched it 30 years later, I remembered how great a movie it is. It's one of those movies that gives you chills. It's all original. If you love this movie, watch Breaking Away 1979, Teen Wolf 1985 and Karate Kid 2 1986.

1475143389|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before I purchase something and in all honesty the negative reviews on here must be from people who expected results just from reading the book. I have learned so much valuable info it's crazy and i'm only 2/3rds the way through. Mike makes it to where anyone can understand what he's saying and turns the foreign language of carbs/calories into something you can easily process. Definitely worth the money.  -Brandon  West Lafayette Indiana
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie is absolutely beautiful to watch and a delight to hear.  A new home theater demo-disc to be sure.  It is Sci-Fi but not necessarily an action movie.  There is a difference!  There are very action heavy scenes but the movie focuses more on the character and mood not the whiz bang action and explosions.  Tell me if this sounds familiar;  a movie comes out that is action based sci-fi and people complain that its vapid and soulless, then a sci-fi movie comes out that tries to be soulful or character driven and its panned as boring, yet if it succeeds as either of these it's called derivative!  I'm sick of sci-fi-nerd-hater culture!  If you like sci-fi without being an overly critical nit-picking hater then you should be able to find plenty in this movie to enjoy.  The cinematography alone is worth the price.  Is it perfect? No, but it is certainly not terrible or cringe worthy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever so much better than temple run and subway surfers anyone reading this don't hesitate GET THIS GAME!!!

B00BEIYN3M|4.0|If you happen to be one of the people that have yet to take notice of Jason Sudeikis, it's about high time that you did.  Since joining Saturday Night Live in 2005 (of which he recently departed), he has impersonated a ridiculously long list of celebrities and been a part of countless memorable SNL skits.  Sudeikis also has taken his comedy to the big screen, starring in a handful of popular comedies, including Hall Pass, Horrible Bosses, and A Good Old Fashioned Orgy.  He is certainly a rising star in Hollywood and will continue on with his humorous antics in featured films, most recently of which happens to reunite him with his former Horrible Bosses and The Bounty Hunter cast mate, Jennifer Aniston.  Easily recognizable for her role on the popular television comedy, Friends, Aniston has had a series of lackluster film roles.  Together, Sudeikis and Aniston may have found the formula for success in the outlandish new comedy, We're the Millers.<br /><br />Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Dodgeball:  A True Underdog Story), We're the Millers stars Jason Sudikis as David Clark, a small time drug dealer that is forced to travel to Mexico by his boss, Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), to smuggle a \\"smidge\\" of marijuana back across the Mexican border into the United States.  In order to present himself as a family man and not draw attention to himself, David enlists the help of a stripper, Sarah (Jennifer Aniston),  a teenager from his building, Kenny (Will Poulter), and a teenage runaway, Casey (Emma Roberts), to pose as his family.  However, David eventually realizes his boss is playing him, which forces the Miller \\"family\\" on the run from an angry drug dealer from whom they stole a massive amount of drugs.  Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, and Tomer Sisley also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />This film is definitely Jason Sudeikis' best effort and funniest featured role to date.  More often than not, his sarcastic humor and abusive language are amusing, providing plenty of hilarious encounters with virtually everyone he talks to in the film.  Sudeikis carries this film on his back and sprints across the finish line, and while he deserves a great deal of the credit, the supporting cast is also well-rounded, bringing plenty to the table themselves.  In the beginning, the film is a bit slow-going - but once Will Poulter, Emma Roberts, and Jennifer Aniston enter the fray, the film is off and running.  From the very first scene in which this \\"family\\" is united, the laughs flow constantly, beginning with an airplane scene that will make you blush, have you laughing at the top of your lungs, and leave you begging for air - and that's just within the first 20 minutes.  Other memorable scenes include Will Poulter's interaction with a venomous spider, Poulter's make-out scene with both Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts, and also Jennifer Aniston's heavily advertised stripping scene.  While the stripping scene is roughly the same exact scene that's shown in film's movie trailer, the big deal about it is that this particular scene was used to attract movie-goers (mostly young men) to the film - and odds are it's going to work pretty well.<br /><br />True enough, We're the Millers is extremely hilarious - but unlike a few recent comedies, like This Is The End or The Heat, We're the Millers lacks a sensible plot.  The storyline of the film basically follows a Dumb & Dumber style \\"road trip across American\\" plot, which makes for some good humor, but bad for anyone looking for thematic, meaningful substance.  This is probably the nicest way of saying the story is stupid, and portrays situations based on the premise of sex, drugs, and complete nonsense.  However, the lack of plot substance is hardly noticeable if you're amused by the style of humor, which was written by Bob Fisher and Steve Faber - both known for scripting Wedding Crashers.  Like the nicely written interactions between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, the Miller \\"family\\" is not asgood, but still written with just enough chemistry to be believable (as a family) and ridiculous at the same time.<br /><br />We're the Millers is one of the rare occasions when you should absolutely feel free to ignore most critics and just go with your gut if you think you might be interested in seeing the film.  The majority of critics can look down upon this film all they want and trash it until they're blue in the face.  But, if you happen to see this film with a large a crowd, take notice of nearly every single person up and down the aisles crying from laughter.  It's definitely a sign these disconnected hags have a stick up their \\"you know what\\" and need to lighten up.  Still, this isn't the first time an absolutely hilarious comedy is vilified by critics and it certainly won't be the last.<br /><br />Overall, We're the Millers is easily the funniest movie of the year, but it's not the best comedy of the year.  Laughs don't always translate to high marks, since there has to be some plot substance - which this film lacks.  Regardless, this film is still worth your time if you want some good laughs.  Obviously, like many other R-rated comedies out there, if you're offended by explicit sexual humor or if you can't handle hearing the F-bomb a hundred times in one sitting, you'll positively hate this movie and everything for which it stands.  On the other hand, if you're pretty laid back and can handle the sexually explicit derogatory remarks and are in need of a good comedy, then you are in for the time of your life.<br /><br />GRADE:  B<br />FNDNreview.comgood, but still written with just enough chemistry to be believable (as a family) and ridiculous at the same time.<br /><br />We're the Millers is one of the rare occasions when you should absolutely feel free to ignore most critics and just go with your gut if you think you might be interested in seeing the film.

B002436WFI|5.0|read the book in the 80's or so. I did not remember much of it other than it was humorous. I was surprised to see that it was made into a movie. The movie is in two parts so if your not paying attention at the beginning (disk menu) you might find the ending strange.
1439152802|3.0|This is the 3rd Kate Morton book I've read, after The Forgotten Garden and The House At Riverton. It's slower than the others, and by the mid point I was rapidly losing patience. I skipped over many passages b/c  they simply don't add anything to the story/character development. I almost put the book down because one of the main characters was very unsympathetic and made me wonder what the point was for the story. Of course everything is wrapped up neatly in the end, but it could do without 1/3 of the pages. The constant flash back and forth does not work so well in this book as it did in the others.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Makes me feel like I'm actually playing uno face to face with my opponent. And Iike how you can actually challenge your opponents.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm a mom, not into anime (or cartoons for that matter), bought this for my daughter. I absolutely LOVE this movie with a passion. It's not like other cartoon films. It has HEART. It is INTERESTING. It's great for kids, but it's also great for adults who like interesting story lines that are realistic, yet fantastical (sounds like a paradox, but ya just gotta see it!).
B004EWEX9Y|2.0|Did not do what I wanted it to do.  Not satisfied.  We wanted to be able to see his Ipod on the TV screen.

B0025KW29U|5.0|I'm not really into musicals, and while I like Joss Whedon I'm not as enamored with him as so many other geeks. But I do love this show. I really hope they make a second one.

140006922X|4.0|The best thing about \\"ZEALOT\\" is it has provoked thought and opened a conversation about Jesus among his followers and those who are not.<br /><br />Two thousand years ago, there was also a lively debate about who Jesus was. Until the days of Emperor Constantine, all the churches were hot beds of individuality and not the institutions that have become big business today.<br /><br />Viewing the resurrection of Jesus as PHYSICAL was a late developing tradition in early Christianity, which was called The Way until the days of Paul, in the third decade.<br /><br />Paul as well as the gospel writers of Mark and Matthew made NO such claim that the burst of life, light and energy that accompanied the birth of Christianity was dependent on any orthodox theology or dogma.<br /><br />The writers of the synoptic gospels-Luke, Matthew and Mark- were NOT eye witnesses to the life and death of Jesus/AKA The Prince of Peace and these gospels [good news] were not based on eye witness memories.<br /><br />Instead, they were liturgical works organized around the Jewish liturgical year and were NOT to be taken literally, but probed within the Jewish context.<br /><br />Jesus was never a Christian; but a social justice, radical nonviolent revolutionary Palestinian devout Jewish road warrior who challenged the job security of the Temple authorities by teaching the people they did NOT need to pay the priests for ritual baths or sacrificing livestock to be OK with God; for God already LOVED them just as they were: poor, diseased, outcasts, widows, orphans, refugees and prisoners all living under a brutal Roman Military Occupation.<br /><br />What got Jesus crucified was disturbing the status quo of the Roman Occupying Forces and teaching subversive concepts such as God preferred the humble, the poor, diseased, outcasts, widows, orphans, refugees and prisoners all living under a brutal Roman Occupation above the powerful, elite and arrogant.<br /><br />\\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" could compel 21st century Christians to see and hear their Lord with new eyes and ears and keep this conversation ongoing.of Nazareth\\" could compel 21st century Christians to see and hear their Lord with new eyes and ears and keep this conversation ongoing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a hair-raising, spine-tingling, page-turner thriller.  Difficult to put down, with an unexpected ending.  If you like suspense, you'll love this one.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|it was bought for my son&#34;s Girl friends daughter to watch<br />but my wife and i watched it first, cute movie
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I live in SF so that made this fun... and I *love* flowers so the subject matter interested me quite a lot.<br />Overall good book, pretty quick read.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Got it on time<br />great movie was i bit hard to fallow at first<br />wife loved it alot<br />Thank you
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Although confusing at times I was intrigued by the changes in structure and perspective. This author took risks and for the most part they paid off. The ending was a bit off putting and unbelievable, I didn't really buy why suddenly Alexander was Mr. Social with Widget, but I was happy with the result for all the people involved. Good story.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Good graphics and decent game play.  Controls are a little awkward and hate how some skills are only available for real cash
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a great way to waste some time and have fun. It is safe for kids and adults can even play. Just real quality fun for everyone
B0067TQQI8|5.0|i got this battery pack for my wife and her galaxy nexus. works like a charm! i need to get another one now for my phone!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I thought at first looks boring but I tried it and it is really addictive I love it and it's better than the first and it is free .the story is really cool and I recommend this game .it has a little bit of blood but it's still good to entertain children but over all its great and its FREE
B0086700CM|5.0|Was not sure if I could learn to play but practice makes perfect, the more I have played the higher my score gets.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best! Omg. The greatest game for all ages kinda like subway surfer but better. You can battle different villains,visit different place and you don't need internet. Too easy to get bananas this game is a rush!!!!!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I am not very good at it but it is fun to play and I will just keep trying until I get the hang of it.
1400049628|2.0|I bought this book after hearing all the hype about World War Z, but after reading this book I just don't see it.  It's not a particularly entertaining book in any genre, it's just kind of there.  It's not a humor book, it's not a horror/thriller book.  It's quite literally, a survival guide if real zombies appeared out of nowhere and you were trying to survive.  You could do something similar with an Alien Survival Guide, a Godzilla Survival Guide, a Vampire Survival Guide, or a Giant Robot Survival guide, this one just happens to be for zombies.  Reads more like an Army manual that a piece of entertainment fiction.  Unless you're a die hard Max Brooks fan, a die hard zombie genre fan, or a nutcase that thinks zombies will really exist one day, then maybe this book will be worth your time.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Use it all the time, I love how I can bounce back and forth between devices and have the same updated information.
1609611543|4.0|I bought this book after reading up on paleo diets and gluten to see if I could gain some more insight into wheat and it's effects.  The book does a good job of putting the science of the negative impact of wheat/gluten into terms the masses can understand without getting too technical.  It's interspersed with some examples the author had with patients who had various maladies cured just by removing what/gluten from their diet but it's important to note that these are unique cases and will not apply to everyone (i.e. don't think this will result in a cure-all for all your ills).  I wish it went into some more detail on the science/research side of the discussion but the author's focus definitely leaned toward accessibility to the widest audience.<br /><br />There is something to the paleo/gluten/wheat free diet though.  I've been on a mostly gluten/wheat free diet for the past 18 months and have lost over 40 pounds.  95% of that weight loss has been from just replacing simple sugars/starchy carbs with fruit and vegetables.  I'll still have some bread now and then but only a serving once or twice a week (I used to eat three bagels and half a tub of cream cheese for breakfast, and three more bagels with the rest of the cream cheese for lunch).  The notion that gluten binds to opiate receptors in the brain though is very real, I still get insane cravings for bread that I have to fight off.  Challenge anyone not on a gluten/wheat-free diet to do the same for a week and they will have a very difficult time.<br /><br />The book is short and a very fast read, with some good information that will help you decide if gluten/wheat-free is for you.  Worth the money and time spent reading  if you're looking to make some changes in your diet and life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Much better than the old way of playing, I really like the different features from being able to change the back ground, card designs, to the different choices of how the cards are dealt.
0307346617|2.0|I've never thought a zombie book could receive so much attention or receive so many positive reviews so I had to check this one out.  Plus I had seen the trailer for the movie and thought the book would be full of thrills.  This book ended up being anything but that.<br /><br />The book is told in a narrative form where the author describes various interviews he has with survivors of the zombie apocalypse.  It's one story after another that's loosely tied by historical timeline and sequence of events, but the only real common character throughout is the narrator himself.  If you're reading this book expecting zombie killing action, thrills, cliffhangers and plot twists, it's not there.  If you can categorize a zombie apocalypse into three sections - pre, during, post, this book is mostly pre, no during, some post.  Even the transition of events from pre to post is very sudden.  There's a giant gap where the actual action that should be happening, is skipped.  Basically all the human vs zombie fight scenes in the film are imagined by the director, none of it takes place in the book.<br /><br />This book stands apart from other horror books in it's approach and while I can see how that it might appeal to some people, it just didn't work for me.  It's readable but it's not that fully engrossing turn-the-page suck-youin kind of book i was expecting.  Read it if you're looking for a change of pace but otherwise you're not missing much by skipping this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the great ideas I have gotten from friends and people I have never met, it's a great way to share recipes, patterns, crafting ideas,  pictures and thoughts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the minions are so cute that I enjoy just watching them. I like the race for the bananas. I'm a begginner  but I think I am going to play for a while.
B005HSL626|5.0|Tried this game on my cell phone as well, enjoy playing it on my kindle much more. I recommend this game to adults down to smaller children, is fun at any age.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The CD I ordered is absolutely amazing!  Her work is so beautiful that it has become a sort of addiction for me.  So glad I got this CD!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game although I am not to good at it, sometimes I actually feel like I am going to fall of the bridge !
B00992CF6W|4.0|I would've ranked it 5 stars because when I try to install skins or texture packs it says<br />urthurized request I did everything but I can fix it I just delete the app and download it again it will be free if you bought it once upgrade it
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game gives you a selection of sharks and is very fun and free roaming but don't forget to eat<br />and dress your shark to your liking
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show and this season! I hope that it continues for many more seasons and can't wait for season four!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Literally fun for everyone, all ages can play. I have a five year old nephew who loves it and I am eighteen, obviously a huge age difference. This game is fun for the whole family and it'd FREE!!!<br />LOVE THE MINIONS AND I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pretty epic game. Lags sometimes but it's awesome. It's so fun to fly on the rocket and collect the bananas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was the best app ever!!!!!!!!I<br />In it you can do any thing you want I can't wait for more updates(:(:(:
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game is another incredibly bad way to cash in on the fandom of bronies and little kids. With one button press you can lose over 50 DOLLARS for in-game content called gems. These aren't a secondary way of buying things. They are instead REQUIRED TO BEAT THE GAME. Certain characters (Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Etc.) Cost only gems and even if you don't pay up, getting gems &quot;naturally&quot; takes FOREVER to get even 5 of them!<br />Bottom Line: Do Not buy this, even if you love the show to death.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is a great app for any age.  You can build whatever you want in creative and fight enemies (or mobs) in survival.  All in all this is an excellent app. As far as updates go, they are behind, but the game will update sooner or later. Thank you for your time for reading this review.<br /><br />-DoubleNM
B00634GHJA|5.0|great app...super easy to transfer files so glad i downloaded it. was able to download it for free app a day and so glad i did.  even if you need to pay for it go ahead! worth the 1.99 for a great app
B008OOYALE|5.0|An amazing job is what I would call art.I have Dragon story and I think it's awesome but that's only my own opinion!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It works well, but occasionally will show a blank screen when trying to view a message or when clicking on the notification icon. It can be mildly frustrating. Otherwise no complaints.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|After finally getting to watch this movie and it took me 2 days cause I was so busy. I loved it. I think its now one of my top 5 favorite action pack movie. Then again Marvel's movies are always AWESOME. For being a chick this had my attention all the time. Every time I had to walk away from my computer I had to pause it cause I didnt want to miss out on anything.
B000I9U8VO|4.0|I like almost all the movies in this series, but the 1st and 2nd are my favorite. Interesting story and good acting in this one.
B007REV4T8|4.0|more like the &#34;old&#34; bond movies-enjoyable and full of action. the movie reverses the standard course by ending the movie with the theme music and a new &#34;M&#34;
B009HUB40Y|4.0|It's a nice take on an old game. I enjoy it, but as always wish I wasn't pressured to connect with friends on FB or contend with the barrage of ads.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very addictive everyone should have it  it is a must have game wish they gave you more gems for free
B00AAQWJCG|5.0|I seldom write reviews but I feel compelled to write this one about Hot Rats. Now, keeping in mind that music is all about personal taste, I would like to say that I have a very large music collection. Tons of music in many different genres and It's all good.  However, it is my humble opinion that Hot Rats is best example of rock music ever recorded.<br />Like many complicated pieces of music, it is not immediately accessible to the average listener. It does take a bit of work to really appreciate if you are simply used to listening to pop music or pop rock. This is music that demands your attention. And when you give it the listening attention is truly deserves you will be rewarded with a positively mind-blowing musical experience.<br />The depth and complexity of the compositions and arrangements is staggering, not just compared to ordinary rock albums but to music in general.  This is an album that can be listened to again and again. And with each listening something new is heard.  It's very complexity is what keeps it fresh.<br />If you are a music aficionado and this record is not in your collection, do yourself a favor and get it.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I love British turn-of the century costume dramas and I love Maggie Smith.  One of my &#34;must-haves.&#34;  Not much else to say!
B009KKLQKO|3.0|I remember the beginning (live) in the 60tees ...unforgettable... This DvD brings the actually al-time old stars in original equipment back on stage. A special moment,nobody can't stop the time-less. Without the fantastic musicians in the background you can forget this snapshot..a monument of perishability from a unforgettable time.....the show is over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome book, so awesome I couldn't put it down. This book had a great story that made my mouth drop in one chapter and shed tears in the next. Two thumbs up Colleen!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|this story of the American Eagles in a fantastic quality. Its one of my favorite DvD's from all my music collection.
B005KQVDH8|1.0|was supposed to be the special edition and got this instead, still love the movie... it is what it is
0765325950|5.0|This was the final book to a series I've read multiple times. This book is a masterpiece. Robert Jordan could not have done better. Drudge through the wasteland that is books 6 through 10 -- its worth it to earn the right to read 12, 13, and 14.
0375869026|3.0|I really enjoyed the plot, and I have to admit, I cried multiple times. The story has an interesting plot and a diverse cast of characters. It's fairly predictable.<br /><br />My biggest gripes, which is why I didn't give it four or five stars, is the writing style.<br /><br />I could have been spared Justin's POV, especially since there was no grammar, making it very difficult to read. I didn't get the point in that plot device. We read he has a \\"tic,\\" but is he suppose to be completely stupid? He's in HS, and Jack is in MS, yet Jack has grammar and capitalizes proper nouns and the beginnings of sentences. This seemed like a first-time writer error.<br /><br />Second, waaaaay too many references that were obviously from the author's time period, and not the current time period. There were some songs, sayings, and pop culture that would not only go over the target audience's heads, but also the characters in the story. I am one of those people who doesn't mind pop culture reference. But the references were all over the place from different time periods, mostly from the author's childhood or teenage years, which completely mesh with the modern references. This seemed like a first-time writer error.<br /><br />Really liked the story, but I think it could have been flushed out a bit more.
B008XG1X18|2.0|After the update that came out a few weeks ago this app will not work properly.  I can like things but it will not let me pin them to any boards; when I try to pin something, my list of boards will not show up and I am forced to close the app.  Worked great before the update but now it has too many glitches.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome i would recommend this game everyone and I think your a lot of fun whoever made this game.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have never read the Sookie Stackhouse novels looking for great literature.  I don't know why some criticized this book as if it were a classic.  It's like a modern day fairy tale.  It was fun to read.  I enjoy Sookie and her friends and their antics.  There is always a battle between the &#34;bad&#34; and the &#34;good&#34;. Yeah for the &#34;good&#34; or trying to be good.  I had predicted correctly from the beginning which guy was going to be her happily ever after.  Sookie had to kiss a lot of frogs, oops..supernaturals, to find her true soulmate.  I am sad that this is the last novel.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Easy to understand and implement. Liked the Christian background. Will be asking my husband to read soon:) thanks Dr chapman
B0008ENICU|5.0|The 1939 movie \\"The Women\\" is much better than remake.  Why do they insist on remaking these great films from the 1930s? You can't beat the originals.  Are all the fans of this film aware that JOAN FONTAINE is the only one living today who was in that movie?  Even the child actress who played daughter \\"Little Mary\\" has died.  Joan Fontaine will be 96 October 22.  Tommy<br /><br />Forgot to mention an interesting fact.  As most movie fans already know, 1939 is considered THE best year for great movies.  Olivia deHavilland & Joan Fontaine are sisters and, as mentioned above Joan Fontaine is the only actress living today who played in The Women.  Her sister, Olivia deHavilland, is the only actress living today who played in Gone With The Wind.  Both movies made in 1939.  Both sisters major stars.  Tommy

B00B2G4O2G|4.0|I really enjoyed the Following. It was one of those television shows that I looked forward to sitting down and watching. I do not watch a lot of television but instead listen to music but this one was an exception.
B000W91RUG|5.0|We love the Big Bang Theory!  It is such a funny and witty show.  The characters are all likeable and if you have even an ounce of nerd in you, you will love this show!
9638303158|4.0|Thought it was the libretto! It's not; it's Tannhauser scored for piano in German :<br />Whoops....<br /><br />If that works for you it looks fine...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't expect to like this series as much as I do.  Great character development, you really either love or hate the characters.  I love the British accents and the scenery/set is amazing!
B0039ZF8D2|4.0|I am a satisfied customer. But i didnt like how there was Stickers all on the front of the CD Case. I wish they were removed before i recieved the Album but hey its all good. Thank you again
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is a great series that keeps you on your toes.  The story line is engaging and the characters well developed.  I would have preferred a little less nudity and sex scenes.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Thank you so much for the CD. The case had a small scratch in the front but its ok. I am a satasfied customer thanks again
B00BQBNK04|5.0|You can't always watch the movie.  SO if you are in your car or on a walk, this collection is perfect for you, if you loved the movie!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love this app and its very easy to use. Pretty much self explanatory and the coolest part is I have actually gotten several responces from real celebrities from official accounts!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is such a good book for those who are interested in North Korea.  You will not put the book down until you are finished.

B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun to play. Gets your mind going, but not too difficult. Wish you earned more than one coin at a time though.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is one of my daughters favorite movies, so she had to buy it.  She has watched it several times already.
B009H2PCNC|4.0|LUX is one of those albums that is similiar to David Lantz albums. Relaxing..dark undertones a familiar set which i have come to admire. Although depending on ones mood can be unnerving and tries the patience..Only 4 Tracks but its colorful. Its perfect for background music while working on side projects...is it his best? Um lets just say...it is in a catagory all by itself...like Eno.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|i rented this before i went to see the second one, and it was every bit of cute and a great movie for children, i see why there was so much hype over it.  one day i hope to show my kids this moving to see how much they will enjoy it. LOVED IT
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I bought this after hearing the song &#34;Radioactive&#34; over and over and over on the radio. Heck, even the video is good! All in all, this is a really good album that does it's best, I feel, when it has that &#34;arena rock&#34; thing going. The lead singer has a excellent voice and is able to belt songs out with his more than capable band. The songs are different enough to prove interesting, although some of the slower songs are not to my taste. Bearing in mind that I like Muse and U2, so that just might be my thing while the more mellow songs can and will appeal to other people. A very good introductory album from these Las Vegas gents. I will await their next album to see where they go. They certainly show a LOT of potential!
B0089XH38M|5.0|Peace of mind about my Tablet.  What more can I ask for?  well I never really have peace of mind about hackers but this is just another layer of protection.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|An excellent tool that I use daily on my tablet.  Easy to use and very useful tool.  Recommend for everyone!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Heart wrenching and depressing.  Had too many main characters, hard to follow. Not good, after reading so many good reviews, I could not grasp I was reading the same book. I would not waste your money.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It would be awesome if they would put candy crush on the kondel. I am on pastels pyramid. When my phone is dead I cannot play :(  I want color bombs! If you agree rate this app one Star
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|REALLY GREAT WORKS PERFECTLY AND INVOLVES EVERYTHING I LIKE SO IT ISN'T BORING AFTER A WHILE LIKE TEMPLE RUN&amp; SUBWAY SURFERS. I LOVE THE OBSTACLES THEY HAVE FOR THE MINIONS =)

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I really liked this book. Although, it was quite different from the movie. I thought it was great! You should read it. It didn't take me very long to finish. Quick read.
B00915G6WQ|1.0|My fiance recently purchased this season for me for my birthday, and the first episode I watch had terrible video quality like it was pirated but I compared it the disks to all my other seasons and they look right. I'm kind of upset that the quality is so bad. I've written to show time, and now I'm writing here. I will have my fiance write a review through his account as well. I don't want a season that is so low quality that it distracts from the ambiance of watching my favorite tv series.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|I was drawn into this series immediately. A fan of David Tennant from his Doctor Who days, I was waiting impatiently for this series to come to this side of the pond. Olivia Colman plays a police officer, Ellie Miller who returns from vacation to find that she has been passed over for a promotion in favor of David Tennant's character Alec Hardy.<br />The two are called to investigate the death of a young boy, whose son is best friends with Ellie's son.<br />Other former Doctor Who actors include Arthur Darville,as the town vicar, and David Bradley, as a shop owner and the boy's employer.<br />I look forward to watching more Broadchurch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! It's super cool and it really speaks out to all the kids out there. KIK ME: Blue_Nerdy Subway surfers is a game for everybody!!! :) It's perfect it's KID friendly (for parents)

0064471837|5.0|The first time that I read this book and its companions, I was in the third grade. I fell in love with them then and have loved them ever since. The unique world Beyond the Wall is so fantastically written that when I read this book, I get lost in a land of paper and ink. Sabriel and her new role as the Abhorsen have quite an adventure, and I just love rereading it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is the best game on Amazon!!! I found out this was on Amazon and I freaked! Make sure before you buy or get a game for free you read the reviews first:)
B003ODIZL6|2.0|The dictionary app is better because you can search for words on that app. But this was already downloaded onto my kindle
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I found the story to be very sad, scary and exciting.  You knew that whatever had happened to Cathy was really bad. She was a messed up person. Would recommend the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun I can't stop playing it I love the minions!! No problems yet. Zoo fun can't stop playing it
B00E193TM2|5.0|Love this band, I have seen them once live and going again in September, where I&#34;m sure they will blow the lid off anywhere they play
B00821OX98|4.0|keeps you watching ; waiting; wanting the next episode. Amazon need to give more than two free seasons. And now I have to add two more words
B009NCM248|5.0|is probably one of the hottest bands right now,and I can't wait for part 2 and I will get that one also
B005K17RU0|5.0|The price is right. But aside from that it has a tremendous amount of information at your fingertip. So I am gonna give it 5 stars
B00EE3HVMO|4.0|The link to Broadchurch popped up on m Facebook feed, and figuring I had a little time to kill, I decided to give the first episode a shot.<br />Overall, the show isn't bad. You've got your semi-typical cop drama that has people who are deeply connected with the townsfolk, a cop with a shattered past that he wants to leave in the shadows, and the outer cast of supporting bodies to progress small strands of the general storyline. There is a hint of a deeper mystery from the primary episode, and with the way it ends you bet I will be grabbing the next episode as soon as it releases.
6305511055|4.0|Three Days of the Condor, 1975 film<br /><br />The story begins in an office building. A man rides a motor scooter in city traffic. A man in an automobile watches people enter this office. [It looks like an old mansion converted to offices.] Workers talks about a novel. What productive work do they do? One worker goes out to lunch by an unauthorized exit. A postman approaches the door. People are shot down with a silenced sub-machine gun! When the man returns from lunch he finds the bodies. Turner takes a pistol for defense as he leaves the building. [This tells about that era.] He telephones in the news and receives instructions. A cleaning crew arrives to tidy up the mess and confirm the report. Condor stays on the street until he visits another victim. Turner is warned about two visitors to his flat!<br /><br />A known friend is used for identification when they meet. But something goes wrong! Condor flies away and enters a store. He says hello to Kathy and takes over her car, she drives to Brooklyn Heights (a trendy location). Upper level management discuss this problem (Condor was blamed by Wicks). He explains his work: reading adventure stories and putting them into a computer so they can be checked against real operations. [Sort of like this review?] The assassin reports to his employer. Wicks will be done next. [Can you believe everything you see on TV?] Turner goes to visit a friend's wife. He takes the elevator down, and gets people to accompany him to his car. Is the license plate read? Turner returns to Kathy in Brooklyn Heights, they talk about things. The next morning Turner read a memo copied to Wicks. Two nurses monitor a patient in the hospital; the warning buzzer goes on. A mailman shows up with a package that has to be signed for. [Note the trick to gain entrance.] Are his shoes unusual? Turner survives, then telephones Washington. We see the Twin Towers in lower Manhattan.<br /><br />Kathy goes to an office building. She is unescorted (believable?). Kathy delivers a message to Addison, who gets to meet Turner for a talk. Wicks died in the hospital. Turner knows how to trace a key to a hotel. Next a phone message is traced. Turner learns a fact and acts on it. He visits the Deputy Director of Operations. Is there a connection between those locations? That Alsatian shows up to perform his job. Attwood won't embarrass his employers. Turner is warned what could happen back in New York city. He meets Addison, who speaks to him about plans and games. What happens if there are future shortages? Turner wrote a report and gave it to a newspaper. [Like the \\"Pentagon Papers\\"?] Will they print it? Who knows? [Their Board of Directors cooperate with Government agencies at times.]<br /><br />Some scenes were filmed in downtown Manhattan next to the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The idea of a novel that could echo a real intelligence operation is interesting. I'm sure some novels could, a work of fiction is better if is based on reality. \\"Double Indemnity\\" was said to be based on the Snyder-Gray murder (a husband bumped off to free the wife). But wasn't there a story in the Bible about King David? I liked this movie better when I first say it in 1975. Parts of it seem implausible today. How much danger can come from a low-selling novel? This was adapted from James Grady's novel \\"Six Days of the Condor\\" but shortened and simplified, like others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't know how she does it, but Colleen Hoover grips you from the start and doesn't let up until it's over!  This is a wonderful story - not just a romance, but a story twist you weren't expecting.  It's a quick read and it doesn't disappoint!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A thrilling and inspiring story. I loved the studies on evolution, intertwined with the strength of the human spirit. Informative and entertaining and Im not even a runner, though I think I will now.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Hey guys,<br /><br />The Legoshop has these in stock for $34.99.  Save yourselves some money.  You are limited 2 per order.  This items was at San Diego Comic Con, but it was not an exclusive.  So no reason to pay a mark up on something that is readily available.
B00BCX2F66|3.0|the case looks nice just when you when you stand the phone on it you can see the &#34;leather&#34; crease a lot on the back and feels like after doing so much its going to start to tear eventually.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|We have been &#34;Friends&#34; fans for a long time. This show has both excellent writing and actors with great comedic timing who can make us laugh consistently.<br />No matter how many times we've seen these episodes we still laugh.<br />I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife, but when she watches them and I'm around I intend to be right there alongside her watching the funniest show we've ever seen.
0544104404|5.0|Parents could bless their children by reading this book. They could bless the world by finding just one underprivileged parent to mentor and pass on what they have learned from the book, and their children and their children's children will in turn be blessed. So be it.
B005721W9O|5.0|Love this movie, can't believe how many people haven't seen it! Really funny, quotable, and entertaining. We enjoyed it immensely (again).
B0064X7FVE|1.0|HAVE THE TWC APP THE Same AS THE APP FOR THE IPHONE. The TWC APP for the Kindle does not have the pollen notices alerts. The new app face is too busy.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Yes, that's what it does: to replace HDMI cable to connect your mobile device to TV but limited to a few apps. Well, if you never knew about Apple Airplay, you'll love this and give it 5 stars, but people who have been using Apple TV would never buy this. Grandma doesn't have a smart mobile device to use ChromeCast, so don't give it to her, but Roku or Apple TV instead.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I love this app it plays all my favorite songs and I can lisen to all my favorite songs and I love that it plays the vidio
B005ONTD42|5.0|Well, this is something you really don't need and it is a pure fun item to have. I bought it for my daughter and (myself) for the summer escapades. The setting up portion and using bluetooth can be a pain. I had tough time with my ASUS Fonepad. It is something in its bluetooth stack, I believe. No issues with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 or Galaxy S4.<br /><br />Once setup, dim your lights. Changing colors of the ball to virtually anything and too from a phone screen. In a different time period, this would have been pure MAGIC. Well, we can't cheat our kids these days. Moving the ball around is great for kids. To some extend, after playing with RC controlled toys like cars/helicopters which are far less expensive kids don't get super excited. I demoed multiple apps for Sphero and my daughter is definitely hooked. The fun happens when there are multiple kids around. Definitely a geeky obsession.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|This movie/film will leave you high and dry with little to no conflict resolution. The plot is thin, emotional, and miracle based. If you're watching it for a film school project, there might be some story-boarding skill set you can get out of it. Its gritty, which conveys an earthy feel that preps your heart to receive a diamond in the dirt tale-- but Matt's character, though well acted, is unexceptional outside of being vaguely mysterious or lucky at best. I don't think I could have appreciated it unless I was an artsy critic of film or I had personal interest in a director, or an actor in this film.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|We bought the CD since we watched show on TV but advertisements on TV are distraction from plot flow. Good quality CD and Case and delivery ahead of schedule.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love how you can pet the horse that you name and it is so great for kids and adults. I love how you can have fun by cleaning up the horse mess and have fun racing in the championship with your own horse  and I am so happy to have a good and fun game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got it and its fun,my mom loves it,she takes my kindle all the time cause of that game. Get the app!!! so much fun!!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is a nice story. It reminded me of childhood imagination and how we all grow up to be the adults we are based on the memories of our childhood.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Well written .touching and humorous. Puts a human face on the tragedy of Ireland's institutionalized children while generously celebrating the resilience of the human spirit
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Lots of action. Not all the characters are truly likable but they grow on you by the end of the movie. You find yourself cheering and laughing at times. There are a few funny scenes. Overall enjoyed it.
B007D48ASU|4.0|We purchased this book to help our son potty train.  He loves the book and now is saying tinkle tinkle toot yay I did it.  It's adorable!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I luv this game it is very addicting and fun! I really love this game (yes, i sai luv&quot;love&quot; twice lol) but this game is great
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book so much that I felt that I knew every character and that I was a part of their lives.  What reading good fiction is all about! Makes you think about your life and how you feel about death .....and love!!!  And honesty.  I recommend this book.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this series.  Its interesting, gives you something to think about, good acting and good stories.<br />It's a welcome change from murders and violence.  Good meaty stuff.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Great movie! Filmed in Italy and the cinematography is beautiful. The story line and the acting is superb! A Classic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a beautifully written book that made me laugh and cry. This is one of the best books I've ever read. A must read for everyone.
B00CJGP116|5.0|For all the fans like me of Marc Anthony music all I can say is - he did it again. This is a great CD, full of romance, longing and you can feel the pain of his lyrics, all of his emotions for the lost of the woman he loved. It was worth the wait after 10 years, now he needs to record a salsa album. I hope is pronto!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Performs well.  You are given a choice to watch now or download and watch later.  Stores videos in photo albums for easy retrieval.  You can enjoy your downloaded videos without a connection.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Nice movie for kids.. keeps you in yr seats and some parts of the movie are really hilarious, story moves fast
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great performing app.  Large numbers and pad - does what they do, yet simple operation.  Need it?  Download it.  I didn't add it to my favorites but still have access to it.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I purchased this item to use once in a while for coupons and such. It seems to be sturdy and cut my sheet of paper well. For the sale price I paid I think it is worth it.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Tried it - didn't like for various reasons - deleted it and am now satisfied using Tube Mate instead.  I can download and watch later with Tube Mate.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is very addictive, and also Very easy to play. You are able to customize your own base, to your liking. The battles (in my opinion) are lacking structure... meaning that the game designers could have done a better job. All in all Its a very fun game, and I highly recommend it. t(._.t)
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|love this movie. Great one to add to my collection of old films. I liked how it was new and arrived in a timely matter,, was also able to track my order thank you
B00632HWOG|1.0|all yahoo did was copy gmail. At least gmail has worked out the kinks. Yahoo won't even respond to anyone's questions or posts.  The new &#34;improved&#34; yahoo sucks out loud!! Go with ANY OTHER mail program. There are 100's of them.
1594136440|5.0|Sent an additonal copy to my mom who can not put it down!!  Very intriguing story and highly recommended!!  Enjoy a great summer read!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|being sold out to zuckerman's corporate pimps is just too much. They can now follow us even when we are not on facebook.  Just say no!
0374533555|2.0|This book is already outdated, from a neural brain theory viewpoint - it is just way to simplistic, leading to conclusions which are totally invalid.<br />The writing is tedious & pedantic, no idea how it could of got so many 5's in the ranking(perhaps because other people gave it 5's - that's a inside joke for this book).
B009AMAJVO|2.0|An Ok movie, not a keeper. With all the talent in the movie, the plot could have been a bit stronger.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love, love, love this... it gets rid of stuff and gives much needed space to run everything smoothly. There really isn't anything bad to say about this app, it does what it says and does it good. You'd be surprised how fast/much mb's build up and hog memory, this helps keep that cleaned & I do it a couple times a week. Would definitely recommend this and being free was an even better deal.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is loads and hours of fun! You get entranced by the game and do not realize how much time has passed.
B00874T02K|5.0|This app is easy an  addictive ...the only workout that I can stick with. Seriously he  this approach  and just following  instructions
1401937519|5.0|Everyone should take time out to read this book! It is very inspiring and worth the read! Very much of an eye opener and it definitely changed my mind of some of my views!
B002NZV68U|5.0|This version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has the weird twists we've come to expect from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  Once you get past Willie Wonka looking a bit like Michael Jackson, the movie is fun and weird and just what you want in a Roald Dahl classic.<br /><br />The creation of the inside of the factory is stellar and the Oompa Loompas are funny and fabulous.  Worth watching.
B007SGM084|5.0|All three books at a very good price and I loved, loved the story.  I would highly recommend this book to all!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie shows Bi-Polar disorder in a good light.  It is a great love story between two odd people that fit together well with all their oddities.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|Whenever I went to update the game to get the new emerald city the game shuts off and goes back to home and gets me mad.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The new format is attractive. Other apps have cluttered displays. This one gives you the basics up front and easy tabs for getting more detail. And the forecasts are reasonably accurate.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy is so good.... So inspiring. I like the part where at the end someone mentions how fickle and forgetful we are about the bad and good things that happen. How those games, or war shouldn't come back, yet we always find a way to get them back.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's really hard not to like a little gadget that will stream YouTube, Netflix and Google Play movies/TV for $35 with more services coming soon. I've been using it for 2 weeks solid and really no complaints. Mirroring a browser tab isn't real good for video, but for doing presentations or having a custom screen saver it works fine, this feature is in beta so I'm sure it will get better, a lot of the performance is dependent on the machine doing the casting when you're mirroring, but only when you're mirroring as the built-in apps stream directly over Wi-Fi. I'll be picking up a few more for the other rooms.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I love movies and had this movie on a VHS.  I have slowly been replacing my VHS movies with DVDs.  The DVD I received was in excellent condition and I received great service.  I am pleased with my purchase.  This movie was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, too.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Video displayed only 7 colored dots.  Called Chrome support at Google and they determined item was defective.  They said they would get back to me with RMA/replacement instructions (Call Ref: 0-6435000001396) within 48 hrs.  They never did!  I emailed them back and this was their response: &#34;Thank you for contacting Google Play. My name is Felicia and i will be assisting you further while Stephanie is out of the office. From what I understand you are waiting to receive an RMA for your Chromecast device. My records do not show that your case was consulted and I do apologize for any confusion.&#34;  They obviously do not have their act together and I do not trust them with a replacement item; therefore, I am returning it to Amazon for credit to my account.

034580709X|4.0|I have read several Nesbo books about Harry Hole, and have enjoyed all of them.  If you like mysteries, I would recommend this series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was a fantastic read. The rest of the series,will be an adventure of its own as I get onto the next installment.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have been a fan of Khalid since my dad introduced me to kite runner. While I enjoyed reading this book it was a little disjointed and scattered for me. I believe  this was the intention but I found myself having to flip back often to remind myself who a character was and the significance in the story at the point I was reading. I was a little disappointed that characters were introduced but never completed. There was a lot left for the reader to speculate on what happened. I am pleased that the end was somewhat happy but not Hollywood happily ever after. This was a good book and I look forward to his next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So cool I love it, has world tours, go on top of trains and run away from the police awesome game, just awesome.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|Remarkable on all fronts. Use of language, nuance and vividness of characters, plotting, history. Worth reading for any of a dozen reasons.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Free download the folks who have your favorite player Tom and I will be a gigantic tall person yahoo.com or a gigantic tall person
0064471837|5.0|This is the sort of book that speaks to a reader of all ages as well as a book an individual can grow with. The complexity of the world, characters, and plot is one that holds the reader spellbound regardless if it is the first or 20th time reading it. I do not know many books that I have read more than once, particularly not ones I read in childhood. However, my copy of this book is so warn, so marked up that the cover is hanging on by a thread. I have owned it for 15 years and I am currently reading it again. It never gets old and is constantly giving inspiration.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is not the best. It is cool but survival craft is better and has more animals. NEED MORE STUFF
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Made for Kindle. Wish they had them a year ago. I was looking for one and found a walmart bran and it did not work well.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is so scary. I play it all the time with my cousin. She is obsessed with scary stuff and is not easily frightened but when slenderman all the sudden popped out of behind a truck with his arms extended we both screamed. The pages are pretty easy to find but not too easy. I do wish there were more options when it comes to picking the location. For the most part I love this game and the thrill it gives you. My only suggestions would be to make more areas to choose from.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|no matter what I do the game willnot play help<br />the whole thing has me upset  l, cant evenplay 2 yr old game as stops in the middle.
B00846REIS|4.0|I put off reading this book because I heard a lot of people compare it to 50 Shades, which I liked but I didn't want to read the same book with different characters. Well, let me just say that I don't think Bared to You is like 50 Shades at all and Im totally digging on this story better. Sure you have a hunky rich guy who owns almost everything, but that is where the similarities end. And honestly, there are a ton of millionaire/billionaire books out there if you want to compare. Well that is all Im going to say about comparing the two because this book deserves its own recognition.<br /><br />I love it when a book can kick up my heart rate and Bared to You did just that. It was well written and it flowed really well. Even though there wasn't any action or really a strong story line, I didn't find myself board. Its all about the relationship and how they react to situations. I want to climb Gideon's pole so bad! And I do like Eva even though I think she blows a lot of stuff out of proportion. Actually the one major thing that dry humped my last nerve is that Gideon and Eva solved ALL their problems with sex! Don't get me wrong... the sex was fantastic and there is a lot of it. But I wanted them to talk about what was bothering them and work through the problems. Plus we never really found out what deep dark secret Gideon has. I mean... we got an idea but don't know for sure.<br /><br />I have to mention Cary, Eva's room mate. I absolutely LOVE him and his bisexuality. I love that he loves Eva and protects her and Eva does the same with him. I'd actually like to read a little bit more about Cary and his relationships.<br /><br />Well, with all that being said I really hope the next book lets me see a little more of what Gideon is made of and reveals his dark secret. I hope that Eva can cut Gideon some slack. And I hope there is a little bit of Cary story.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book is great. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out. Gideon is better than Christian!

B00B2QG3K2|5.0|It's has more of a retro sound to it. LOVE IT! I do miss the 'rocky\\" edge the previous records had though. This album is different from the old Paramore, but you have to look at the fact that there are new members and bands have to evolve to stay afloat, even if it means disappointing old Paramore lovers. I think the next album will be right on key.
140006922X|4.0|Of interest and well written, but certain arguments are more asserted than proven.  I did not change my opinions/beliefs, but I did learn some new things.  Not written for the typical fox-watching idiot: you guys should stick to coloring books.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It plugs into your HDTV HDMI but require you to use an attached wire to connect to your USB port for power. If you don't have an available USB port then you'll have to connect to a power cord. The way it's advertise is just this dangle but reality is messy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|....great book....LOVE it.  Amazing story that gives me even more faith in life after death.  Just about everyone from teenagers and up should enjoy this.
0670026638|5.0|Ruth Ozeki's wonderful novel will not leave me alone, but continues to playfully and seriously engage me<br /><br />Ozeki is a Japanese/American/Canadian, and incredibly fine writer and a Buddhist priest.<br /><br />This novel is written in two voices. The first is that of a 15 and then 16 year old Japanese girl, Nao. Nao was born in Japan but her parents moved to America when she was 3. She feels American to herself. Now they have moved back to Japan and all is not well. Japanese culture is remarkably weird to her, and her experiences are pretty horrendous. Nao begins to write a diary about all the things which happen to her, but she is also trying to write the life story of her great grandmother, an 104 year old feminist and Buddhist nun.<br /><br />The second voice is the voice of Ruth, a Japanese/American/Canadian writer who has moved from Manhattan to British Columbia with her husband.<br /><br />The novel is the journey of these two voices and their worlds. The plot is elliptical, flowing, lateral, sideways, patterned and playful.<br /><br />I'm deliberately saying nothing about how these worlds and voices connect and form something lovely - tender, horrendous, shocking, charming - because this is a book which demands the reader to have the experience, be surprised, be amused, be sickened, be saddened, laugh, cry.<br /><br />Part of what Ozeki is exploring is reality itself, time, beings in time, writers and readers, lots about mathematical theories, but mainly expressed through the deep and playful view of Nao's grandmother - oppositions and paradoxes are all held : Up, down, same thing as old Jiko says.<br /><br />Oh and there are lovely little footnotes to help you learn Japanese phrases and recognise kanji<br /><br />How can you not be intrigued by a book which starts with one of the main characters sitting in a French Maid Caf&eacute;, Fifi's Lovely Apron (soon to become Fifi's Lonely Apron), in Akiba Electricity Town, listening to Edith Pilaf.<br /><br />However, be warned, this switches from light to dark and back again, repeatedly - it is, after all, about everything in time.<br /><br />I am now buying Ozeki's earlier 2 novels. What I particularly like is her ability to inhabit some serious debates about all sorts of topics, from the environment, to warfare, to mathematical theories but to explain clearly, playfully, engagingly. A light touch serious writer, sage and fool combined.<br /><br />I received this as an ARC from the Amazon Vine programme, UKer, be warned, this switches from light to dark and back again, repeatedly - it is, after all, about everything in time.<br /><br />I am now buying Ozeki's earlier 2 novels.

B00AO3K05S|5.0|I liked everything about this book - and that's no small feat. Praise to Daniel Pink for providing us with this piece.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son was super excited to open this. One downfall would be that it is sort of difficult to assemble, as the lego pieces are SUPER tiny! Still, great item overall.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great product. Works really well.  The only way to make sure your tablet is clean and tidy.  Saves on your battery by closing down stuff that is not needed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is wonderfully absorbing.  When watching, you find yourself relating to both those who have and those who work for the haves,  The show portrays the problems and joys of both the upper and lower classes.  The costumes and scenery are wonderful and the historical aspect of the show is great.  I can't wait for season 4.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I wish the things u need to find were a little clear or bigger because I use u my hints at the end of the timer to find them. It should always give u hints and not have to buy them. I don't know how. Much longer I will be playing this.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|As a dramatization of the Apollo moon program, this was clearly a labor of love on the part of Tom Hanks, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, the production team on the successful and generally straightforward Apollo 13 feature film. While certain aspects of the moon program—particularly the vital Apollo 10 mission—are shortchanged, attention is duly paid to most of the things that matter, including certain Gemini milestones and a remarkably illuminating approach to Apollo 9, possibly the mission most ignored by the public, then and now, in the whole sequence. And while the depiction of Apollo 13 is not entirely successful, depending as it does on fictional characters more than any other segment, it is still an admirable attempt to provide an alternate perspective on what had already been covered in the feature film. All in all, the series is informative, entertaining, moving and edifying, and leaves one to wonder how our nation could have pursued such a grand vision so successfully and then let it fail just when the realization of all the promises of manned space exploration seemed open to us.
B00111YM5G|3.0|I believe there was somuch potential here that WAS NOT tapped, both with the actors and actresses...the story was a good one, but the crew had their hands tied.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Overall I think this game is excellent. It can be very challenging but that the fun of it! Very good way to waste some time.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Best sci-fi ever ever made! I would like to see a sequel in the near future. There is huge potentil here!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|BIG SWING FROM THE PAST TWO BOOKS.  KINDA DRAGGED ON BUT ENJOYED THE COMPLETE RESOLUTION. NOTHING LEFT TO WONDER.  SAD ITS OVER.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Runs good and easy to play. I have no problems playing it. I suggest it for anyone who wants to waste some time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is an awesome game! I love it! the graphics are good and is a good time killer ! love it
030726999X|3.0|I loved the first two books! But this one I just can't get into it.  I have been reading it now for the past year and still not finished.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|I really do not like writing reviews. But, I guess I will. I really did not like this movie. It was just lackluster in every aspect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great erotic, romantic trrilogy!  Highly recommend for anyone who is a true romantic and can really dig deep into the power of sex and love!
B00DCRE83S|4.0|After reading Mick Wall´s biography on Metallica, I got the feeling that Jason Newsted on occasions was treated bad by the other members of Metallica. After all, he was the bassist in the band when I truly discovered them with the \\"Justice\\"-release back in 1988, so to me he was the quartet´s natural choice as a group member. I hope he will get his revenge with this well-crafted release. If I compare to his his former band, I would say it is closer to what Metallica sounded like in the ´90s rather than their pioneering ´80s.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I almost did not get this book!  Because of all the negative reviews regarding it being a 5 book series and not a trilogy!  I absolutly loved it!  It really answered a lot of questions about Guideon and closed the chapter on many of the charcters,  yes there was a cliff hangor on some charcters, but people there are going to be 2 more books!!!!  I thought this was as good if not better then book one!!  Highly recommend this if you loved the first two books!  Not to sure about the negative comments, but I was waiting and waiting for what I had read in the review section and nothing was accurate at least I didn't think so.  I love to read and read about 5 books a week so maybe that is why!  So pick it up and read it, you'll get a lot of questions answered about a lot of charcters!  Can't wait for book 4 and 5!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I had this on my first kindle fire then put it on his nook while I waited to get my second fire. Got my youngest hooked on it too. I love that you can turn off the sounds and timer as well as reset it all to start all over. Great puzzles in many shapes!
B00AA2UO0E|5.0|Great movie, great quality, good bargain. If you do get it make sure it's on HD the special effects are spectacular.
0671449028|3.0|This book is okay, their s definitely Biblical undertones to this book. Like a Noah's Ark type reference, rhyming text, nice illustration. An okay bedtime book, but my sons favorite is It's Time To Sleep My Love that is the perfect bedtime book.
B00BEEC6L2|5.0|For some reason the art work was in black and white but aside from that it was great it literally featured dozens of issues. I think there was over 500 pages to this book and it was all the original issues of Judge Dredd. If you're a fan of the series I highly recommend it.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|I am not usually interested in these movies but it kept my attention the whole time. I watched this movie finally for one reason. my idol is in it. I figured it is a small part so I never checked it out. I own most of her movies and I am so glad I check it out she is in this movie a lot more and plays a important part in the film and that person is Michelle Yeoh. She was wonderful in this movie. I think they used her talent and could of went farther with it. That is why I watched it but I enjoyed the movie I didn't think the movie was slow at all and thought it was entertaining and I am not a Vin Diesel fan but I did like him in this. I also love the actress who played the younger girl. I thought the acting was very good in the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really liked this game. it was challenging but not impossible.  it makes u think. I was addicted from the start
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have not used it very much, but so far it has been correct everytime :)  I just thought it would be handy to have on my Kindle and it is.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game, kids love it, fun to use, lots of neat scenery and graphics, and cool horses.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat and up reading into the early hours of the morning.  The ending was good but not what I expected.  I should have known that in such a tortured world even the happy ending would be miserable.  But I loved it all, even in the sadness.
B00CKYIENY|5.0|Though not completely recommended for the superficial or intermediate reader, this Austen classic is a high must for those interested in historical fiction, strong literary work and vocabulary, gradual and more realistic romance and family situations or a fantastic medley of all, I highly highly recommend this novel to hold place in your bookshelves or e-book libraries. A fantastic lesson and story of human follies and love.
B0070ZLZ1G|1.0|I bought this book after reading great reviews about this from the Economist. I was disappointed to find that this book is a compendium of research conducted on mostly black/hispanic children in the United States who come from a poor and troubled background. There is nothing about how children from poor economic situations in Asia develop themselves and attain college degrees. And besides that, is having a college degree and a 'well-paying' job the ultimate goal in a person's life. Well, in countries like Australia, you don't need a college degree to earn a $150k job in an investment bank. An UK passport might help though. It just shows how troubled and complicated the system in US is. To the African Americans in the US, my suggestion is if you cannot study hard, immigrate to Australia. You guys are treated like royalty over here.<br /><br />This book is a load of rubbish that must be avoided like plague..
B002GHHHL0|1.0|I DID NOT LIKE THIS IT WAS VERY CHEEZ. NO GOOD ACTING. GLAD I DID GET MY MONEY BACK FOR GETTING THIS FOR A FRIEND.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this series, but what do I know, I'm just a bored housewife ;)  If you are expecting a literary masterpiece, expect to be disappointed.  But if you know going in that this is just a kinky romance novel to read for fun, then you may actually enjoy it as I did!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|We saw Quartet when it was out in the movies and was disappointed that it was not up for an Academy award. Dustin Hoffin's directing is right on and the actors are a joy to watch. Besides, I will watch anything Maggie Smith is in.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this you will like it to happen to get on the game and it is appreciated and I have a lot of fun
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is my daughter's favourite book and has been pretty-much since she could read. She pestered me for years to read it, either on my own, or aloud to her and my son. We'd done Harry Potter (twice) and the Hobbit/LotR and a few other series and I figured reading Sabriel would finally get her off my back about it.<br /><br />So we go away up the coast and rent and caravan and I take a few board games and Sabriel. Things are going really well until one night after playing a few games, I open the book and start to read it to the kids. After the first few chapters I'm thinking \\"Hey, this is actually pretty good.\\" After the next chapter or two I find myself not really wanting to stop, but I guess I have to, don't I? Next day we go to the beach and muck about, but the whole time I'm thinking I want to go back to the caravan and keep reading. At lunch  I have a chat with the kids and find out they were thinking the same thing.<br /><br />So that was the end of the holiday. We spent the rest of our time back in the caravan park reading Sabriel and eating junk food. It's a fun read with some great concepts, but nothing to tax the brain too much. I'm really looking forward to reading the other books now, and happy that I don't have to wait for the next installment.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|This app is fun.....but only for people good at it.  I got this game thinking it will be fairly easy and fun.  Instead i got a fast paced short game where i only get 30 seconds.  I would rather stick with mariokart
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|I have been waiting a LONG time for this CD. I am so happy he didn't use his NoTalent-Can't sing EX on his album!!  He has peeled back all the layers of his past HO problems and actually put his heart and soul into this. It has pain, anguish, all raw emotions that hopefully will continue to bring us the REAL Marc. I love his emotional rendition of Copa Rota. He is really \\"feeling \\" the words and melody. I disagree with one reviewer that complained about the CD being only 41 minutes.  I look for QUALITY NOT QUANTITY--This album is beautiful, raw filled with heartache and emotion. I am very proud to be an always and forever fan of Marc Anthony. I look forward to more of this musical genious!  I HIGHLY recommend this album.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|best keyboard out there but like everything it's not perfect..  what annoys me is the space bar maybe adjusting auto correct could help...?more color choics wwould be cool
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! its my faborite app ever!!! and I also love that u collect bananas instead of coins like every other running game
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it!!! Loved how the hero and heroine came together without the typical macho control thing I usually see in these books!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love how cool he looks in some of the costumes and jetpacks and playing this game all over again is the best part
B00CLZ48FA|1.0|I redeemed my code for a digital copy and selected amazon and amazon is not a provider for my android tablet!!!! and I can not see the movie and there are no options to change the provider!!!<br />I sent an e-mail and nobody has contacted me to resolve it!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's a great way to play uno when no one at home wants to play with you. I do wish it was easier to get additional coins during the day.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Yes it is dated and the acting is a little overdone. And Yes i have seen this robot in other films. But dang it i love it.. 50 years old and then some i cant belive it. I remember seeing it at an outdoor movies place. in my early teens. And it is one of those movies you cant get out of your mind,,, Watch it you will love.....A BIG A+++++++++++ from me....
006117758X|5.0|Charles Bukowski is a phenomenal writer and this novel pays homage to him once again. It's dark and gritty just like most of his books. This novel covers Henry Chinaski's early life as a boy at school. This is where his perverse personality was formed. Depicting his acne riddled days being bullied at school and protecting himself against his father, this novel digs deep into his complex character. Fantastically written and thoroughly engaging.
B004SIP71M|5.0|What's not to like all three of my favorite actresses in one film... Very good.... A little over acted by  Hoffman. All over a very good film. Meryl is at her best here. Is there anything she cant play. I love her..... Get it you will love it.... A+++++++
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works well and the one for money is 0.99 chefs but its the exact same thing and its just with. new little wallpaper and that's it nothing more fancy. so enjoy this app its wonderful.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this novel. Much more of a story line than 50 Shades. Way more graphic on the love scenes but it fits.
0062255657|3.0|I really don't understand what's behind all the critical praise this book is getting. This struck me as a very average telling of a not particularly original story. I didn't hate it, but doubt I would recommend either. I've read juvenile fiction that was more compelling.<br /><br />(Don't hate me for being honest)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|They know how to draw you in.  I can't wait to see how they move forward in the next season.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|UPDATE:<br /><br />Anker contacted me about my experience with the charger.  I explained my situation with them and the customer support representative (Sunnie, you're awesome by the way) was very helpful.<br /><br />I've waited to write this review to get some real world testing and make sure that there wasn't any problems again.  The charger now properly charges my phone, a Galaxy Nexus on Verizon Wireless and their 4G LTE that eats battery for all 3 meals.  I can be running Ingress, which is a game that uses a constant data stream, GPS, GPU and keeps the screen on.  The charger pumps enough juice out of either port to keep the phone going in the positive direction the whole time.<br /><br />If you need a car charger, get this one.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />This USB charger does the job, but not for my particular requirements.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus on Verizon Wireless.  If I use the indicated Android charging port, it will not charge the phone while I'm using.  This leads me to believe that it's not truly a 5V/2A output.  The \\"Apple\\" port does a good job of charging, so I won't knock it there.  I know for a fact that 5V/1A will keep the phone charged while using because I used to use a DC-AC inverter with my 5V/1A wall charger plugged into it, and it kept up just fine.<br /><br />Since I'm not unhappy with it, I'm fine with the product.  It will keep my Nexus charged (plugged into the \\"Apple\\" port) and will charge my wife's Droid RAZR (not maxx) while playing Ingress (GPS, Data, Screen on all the time) so it does put out some juice.  I was just disappointed with the charge rate for the particular USB port.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I love this game. I got nice graphics and animations. It's a superb story. The gameplay is excellent. I do recommend this game.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Just a streaming device dependent on Computer, smart phone or tablet. Not an independent device. Need power thru usb adaptor.
B0012GN47C|5.0|I purchased this for my mother as a surprise, she has the album and needed a copy on a CD..
B00CPLGGXM|1.0|AMD must be joking.<br /><br />For the unaware, with AMD's current architecture, they give each core twice the integer units, and call it two cores. As such, to get the real core count, divide it by two.<br /><br />This thing is slower than an i3, uses like 4 times the power, and the iGPU isn't even that good. Seriously, Intel's Iris Pro 5200 is faster. 14553 for Intel on 3DMark06 vs 11935 in 3DMark06 for this.<br /><br />Plus, the power consumption and heat generation of this thing is horrible.<br /><br />AMD, are you even trying?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game but was disappointed that there were on 10 levels. I would like to see more levels.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Ozzy is like a fine wine.....he ages well with time. Ozzy is to rock like Bach is to classical....awesome food for the soul.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Yet another great read by  a fantastic author. I am so glad I got the chance to read this book. Thank you.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire about a year ago, and it was ok.  It froze more then I'd like, but I kept it for a quick check of weather.  Recently it went through a major revision and change for the WORSE, if that's possible.  Since I wasn't happy with it prior to the update, I deleted it from my KF.  All I want is the weather, not photos of the Brooklyn Bridge, not other apps within apps.  Just the weatther, Please!! How hard is that??  Temperature, foreseeable forecast, severe weather alerts - that's all is needed....
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Excellent sound and picture quality. Compact book holding all these wonderful movies plus a couple of bonus discs I haven't even explored yet. Love these movies, and BluRay makes them even better.
B000001FDK|3.0|I got my order today it was on time. I wanted to get the movie and I got the cd.  next time I order ill make sure its a dvd not a cd. thank you very much shane....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|An excellent book.  Like many other books, it lets one immerse themself in its world as readily as the OASIS written about within it.
0762445262|1.0|My grandson is very much into Batman. We were hoping to use this light as a night light. After using it for one hour, the signal/light stopped working. Replacing the bulb did not help. It is a fun idea, but not worth the money.
0142403873|5.0|This is a very fun book and my 3-year-old just loves it! The illustrations are great and it has a great story line with plenty of rhyming, making it an enjoyable read over and over again.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|After less than 2 months of ownership and only semi-regular wear (never did anything physically strenuous or harsh with it on) and the freaking springbar just fell out on its own.  So the band of course disconnected and the watch fell off.  No warning, didn't get caught on anything, shaken, or anything out of the ordinary.  Super lame
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I've gained so much inspiration and knowledge from this book. I was already on this path with my life and Harv brought it full circle for me by showing me how to include money skills on my journey
161655164X|4.0|The reason I am not giving 5 stars is because somehow during shipping, a corner of the book got smashed. Other than that, this book is amazing! The concept artists of Naughty Dog has done a great job. This book is both beautiful and instructive. A great Book about a Great Game.
B003L20IJM|5.0|simply devine as Nanny McPhee. could use her around here with the g-kids. was well received by the various ages 3-19
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a wonderfully written tale with vivid imagery and likeable characters.  I can see things that were left out of the movie, but when adapting a book for the big screen, it is not uncommon for details to be omitted to fit a certain timeframe.<br />A couple details I wish had been kept in the movie, were the real exchange of the mockingjay pin, the details of the mutant dogs and Peeta's leg at the end.<br />Overall loved the book and still like the movie.  Can't wait to start reading the next book!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun game. Easy to play. Keeps me coming back to see what missions I have next.I recommend this game. I have no problems with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, the only thing I wonder is where is the ending, I mean can you win this game? But other than that it's great.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I have watched all the season, so far, of the Borgias.  Purchased this to add to my Borgia library.  This Pope was truly one of the worst; his family and their values were indicative of power!  This historical-fiction movie has great acting by all those involved, has more plot twists than Lombard Street in San Francisco, includes romanticism, war, sneaky liaisons, and just when you think the plot settles down ... it takes off again on another nasty turn.  Great stuff and it pretty much follows the history of the times.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Did not work.  I think it started to mess with my phone so I removed it immediately.  I'm not sure why it doesn't work.
B009MO5E10|4.0|This movie, although not that popular at the movie theaters, was fast paced, had great film editing with all the bicycle riding views, and included the action of real life 'deliverers in a large city.'  It was extremely entertaining.  Hang on to your seats.  It is a RUSH!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg I like this game so much! You can collect the bananas and get power ups and it's just really fun I can not just bet someone to say that I can't play it for a day that's hard
B004FK24ZA|5.0|If I give this a 5, then &#34;Preacher's Wife&#34; gets a 4; but both are for those into The holiday traditions.<br />Dan
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This game is free and fun it is really fun for a great deal it is super fun I love it.
B003YL4L0W|2.0|I was hoping for more of a storyline around the music therapy aspect. I have read the majority of Jodi Picoult's books and this was my least favorite thus far...I was disappointed to say the least.
1169831990|5.0|Excellent quality.  Some versions of Keynes magnum opus leave the reader wanting.  Some are little more than printed PDFs.  This faithfully reproduced print of the original 1936 version of The General Theory has clean text, sound formatting, tight binding, and solid boards.  This is the version to get.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved Hosseini's other books but this one was confused as it shifted characters all the time. It was difficult to embrace the characters in this book but the point of view kept shifting from one character to another. The premise was very appealing but I found myself to be very disappointed by the end of this book.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I was a little worried ordering such a cheap pair of headphones but the sound was amazing! They fit comfortably, perhaps a little loose. Also was worried if the aux plug in would fit a normal phone (like an iphone) and it does great once you screw off the adapter!
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I went ahead and watched the move 100 times in a row but still nothing .  my IQ ,just can't breach 60 pts.errrr
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Omg I LOVE Temple Run 2! Again Imangi studios have made a success!<br /><br />I mean  who wouldn't absolutely LOVE this game<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review hope you enjoyed it
B000008IAI|5.0|The songs list is great as well as the performances .The quality of course is there.The only thing doesn't have is the live vibe.Since this came out I have always thought it is over produced.It just doesn't come accross as a live recording .<br />It is really great but it just doesn't have that\\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" quality about.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is a good ad-free calculator that does it's job well and it does have a history. feature where you can go back and see what an answer you added or subtracted earlier is a nice feature that makes this a good calculator
B0063M22QO|5.0|I actually play the real version of Mahjong, using the Chinese tiles. I play with a large group of ladies and so it is a lot of fun. The Kindle Tablet Edition is very easy and much fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game it is fun. and the minions are so cute and it is something to do when the day gets boring
B00DUHT3OO|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is my favorite book by Jane Austen.  Much more entertaining than Pride & Prejudice!  Also recommend her lesser known classic, Northanger Abby, which is a Gothic spoof.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Restaurant Story. is so fun. I have. been playing it for almost a year now. its a good game but a little time consuming. you can spend real money but don't have to to get by. I recommend it if you like cooking games.
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|I ordered this on August 1st, and for some reason (unexplained to me), I was not supposed to receive it until the 7th (which was yesterday).  It's the 8th, and no dvd.  It was supposed to be a gift.  Once again, relying on Amazon's shipping, even with paying for Prime -- is unpredictable, not dependable, unfortunately.  Bought into the whole Prime thing, and many things are received within that 2-day timeframe.  The problem is Amazon NEVER explains these things.  They take your money though!  According to PRIME PROMISE, I should have received this by the 5th (allowing for weekend).  Why did a 2-day shipping promise turn into a week + with no explanation and no DVD?  Maybe the Amazon folks know the answer?<br /><br />Unhappy once again!
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|This is a better fantasy novel than most. Character development is somewhat weak, but the story is intriguing and unpredictable. Recommended.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  As a middle aged non-runner I came to this book on the recommendation of a co worker.  The story is engaging, the characters entertaining and the underlying scientific thesis interesting.<br /><br />The reason I docked the book one star was the author's penchant for hyperbole: every runner was gorgeous, every race brutal, every shoe company evil, etc.  in addition, it is clear that the author drank the koolaid which makes the scientific section (whose conclusion I actually agree with) feel a bit unbalanced in delivery.<br /><br />Overall, however, these are small quibbles on a fun, fast read that has made me want to start running.  Pick up the book and you'll be yearning to lace up your sneakers... Or flip flops... Or old rubber tires... Or barefeet and hit the road.
0142418471|5.0|i absolutely loved this book!! it was full of pain and love, trust and hate. In my opinion it opens peoples minds about gay and lesbian people, people think they should not be able to love who they want to or they jump to conclusions about the person. i love my sister, does that make me lesbian, NO! i love my friend she is like my sister do that make me lesbian, NO! people need to be free about who they love and who they are and other people need to clean up there act and deal with it when your gay or lesbian your gay or lesbian its not like they can totally change the way they think there will always be that shadow no matter who it is or how they act.<br />-Sim
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is the second game I've downloaded from this developer and overall it's not bad. Good points are the searches are not too easy and quite often have a \\"facepalm\\" moment.  It's easy enough to get to grips with quickly too.<br /><br />Bad points are on the Kindle Fire HD the map zooms but any writing doesn't which even with the aid of eye glazing, can be difficult to read. Also too many quests appear at once, you're not always sure which one to follow.
B00CKOQC9C|2.0|The author gets Ten stars for this true masterpiece describing human nature, and what we do best: eff up anything we can trying to control it. After total annihilation we move on to a new place.<br /><br />Amazon, gets only two stars for leaving out the very important part of the &#34;n+++++s&#34; leaving. Did Amazon think we couldn't handle this chapter? I am deeply offended that they just omitted an entire section of American history. As if by deleting the section made this atrocity not a fact.<br /><br />Shame on you AMAZON!! Put it back!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Packed with funny sound clips and references to the movies, this cross between temple run, subway surfers, and the despicable me films makes for a great endless running game accessible to all ages. The gameplay is tight, responsive, kept fresh through changes of scenery, and yes, the minions make it all the better.
B00BGRA3IU|4.0|The selection is excellent although this LP has been remastered or created slightly bright.  The imaging is very nice and the detail and upper treble shimmer of Eva's voice comes through nicely on this Best of Eva Cassidy LP although in a slightly lean way that over accentuates the treble and robs a little warmth from the midrange and makes me inclined to want to turn the music down.  The Songbird LP seems to have captured the richness of the mid-range of Eva Cassidy's voice much better and rendered the natural beauty and timbre of her voice in a more natural and soothing way.<br /><br />Some will prefer the Best of Eva Cassidy with its slightly more lean and detailed presentation and larger song selection - as it is still indeed a very good recording.  Yet, if I had to choose one LP or the other based on the quality of the recording, I personally would go with Songbird for its more musical and rich well textured mid-range.  However, those who feel that their system lacks treble or viny in general lacks treble, will love this LP.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love, love, love, this book/ series! It kept me captivated the entire time! What a cliff hanger, I can't wait for the next book! A must, must read
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|This is the most fantastic selection of recordings I own. And they are by one of the original \\"blues men\\".y favorites are \\" Best in Town\\", \\" I Go By Feel\\" and \\"One Day Away\\". But it, you won't be disappointed. Plus for this little price, you get TWO CDs! And to make it more desirable, after I bought it, I downloaded the entire playlist to my IPhone from Amazon, and was playing the music days before the CD came. If you like blues, don't let this deal get away!
B00634GHJA|3.0|This app is decent. The price is too much. Unless they make some more work to it. It's not safe either. I see a lot of people are saying drop box is better. The good thing about this app is that there isn't a certain amount of pictures and videos you can have in storage, like dropbox. You can transfer photos and videos whenever you want. But then dropbox is free. Even though i got this app from &quot;Free app the day&quot;. All they have to do is put more work to it :) decent app though.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|Played this game for a while but lost interest rather quickly. I am not placing blame on anyone but me, this game is entertaining, but fell flat for me. My kids seem to enjoy it every once in a while though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|well I am downloading it now and my friend Mathew plays this and it looks awesome five star already lol...
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Downloaded this app, played with it for the first night and haven't touched it since. Will be deleting it after this review. Just not practical for me. However, the app itself is a fantastic app for what it is made for.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|God, I love this guy's mind!  The sweetness and sadness of yesteryear inter reined with the hardship and perils of what if.  A must read for any King fan.  King 's brilliant portrayal of the late 50's and early 60's is artfully crafted that leaves one with a healthy dose of nostalgia with a touch of fear.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|So glad this was the FAOTD. Otherwise, I might have never found this gem. This game is a point & shoot game of sorts. The monkey is on a trampoline/slingshot and your objectives are to collect the gems or bananas. There are several types of game play to the game. Very impressed. Great graphics. Would definitely pay the $.99 for this.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a captivating tale! It is very unique!  Readers that love the circus, magic, and mystery will relish this book!  The characters are developed so well that the reader will feel a distinct connection to them.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is entertaining, but I have deleted it. This is a time consumer. The amount of time that took for things to grow or cultivate was okay (not for this impatient person). I got to the point where I was forgetting to check on my little ocean and didn't seem to be advancing very well. The game got boring.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I already own the essential collection, HD collection, But I could not pass up owning them another time. ;)<br /><br />This collection is absolutely perfect for someone who has not yet played the MGS series.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game starts off really easy. You try to match the ball on the box with one you create. It gets very challenging towards the final levels trying to figure out which layer of paint to apply and which tools to use to get the final result.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is awesome the graphics are really good and the game has a lot of upheavals  and plans for Improvment Dunne do floating
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I was against getting Fruit Ninja just because I thought it was a pointless game. However, thank you for making it the FAOTD! I am so glad that I gave it a chance. I played it for days....
0525953728|5.0|Great Book! If you want to hear the real story about Osama Bin Laden's glorified death in detail this is a must read! Terrific Book!
B005V5WBFG|2.0|I am not a fan of games or apps that claim to be free and end up being a purchase. Deleted.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I was introduce to ebay by a coworker, I've been hooked ever since. One day I was looking for apps to install and there it was eBay app
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is a very entertaining game. The levels are very difficult to complete with a star, however, you still pass the level without it. City building meets time management. Very fun.
B00634GHJA|1.0|Airdroid works a lot better then this app does and it works for all file types and the best part about airdroid Is it is FREE anyway.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a very entertaining game. You have to really utilize every part of the levels to complete the puzzle. The levels are not so easy that you blow through them. Very fun game.
0307742997|3.0|a very well plotted and complicate story.<br />but somewhat too complicate.<br />a perfect crime is always simple and disguised into every day life, so that it is difficult to break.<br />in spite Nesbo indeed has cleared all the points, but I find the motive derived from insanity is not so creative.
1616551607|5.0|Indispensable for any fan of Final Fantasy and the art of Yoshitaka Amano, book of great quality, perfect! I am very happy with the purchase, this value is very low, is worth much more ...
B00BI73CVI|3.0|don't watch the movie, go to a production with real singers instead of really really pretty skinny people. if you have to watch a 'movie' version watch the stage version.  get out of your house for crying out loud!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it!  Not too hard not too easy.  My 12 yr old found it fun too.  Wanting more rooms soon!
034552554X|5.0|it's a lovely book, easy to read and meaningful. book arrived quickly and in good condition. can't think of more to say
B0049P1VHS|3.0|If you can imagine days of our lives with zombies that's it. Not horrible but the crying and games they play gets annoying after awhile.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very inspiring.  I use the wisdom and advice from the book on an ongoing basis and am much more observant of gender biases in the workplace.  A very easy read and full of real life examples that really spoke to me as a female employee of a tech company.  I will certainly lean in and take a seat at the table more proactively than I probably would have before this book opened my eyes.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love this game. i play every night before bed. please fix the problem with it crashing all the time. thanks
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I love all of Michael Connelly's books, especially Harry Bosch.  They are well written.  The Lincoln Lawyer series is good, too.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|So happy with the latest addition to my Twilight Barbie collection. Nicely posed in the box and nice attention to detail with the accessories.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I was truly enthralled by the superior story line, acting and scenic panoramas encompassed in this riveting film. In fact, the performances by the two adolescent actors rate among the most convincing that I've ever seen.  And the supporting cast is just as outstanding.  While this is essentially a coming of age movie, it embodies a very dark atmosphere, laden with mystery, suspense and the unexpected. I truly believe that this production is of Academy Award quality.
1476734941|1.0|I went on the fast diet had my blood taken and a lot of my levels were not in the normal range.  I do not recommend the IGF-1 test as it is mainly for children who have growth problems.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is a realky cool app .but the down fall is that u have ti have internet access to access this app but other wise u should downs load it....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave it five stars because my kids love it.  I think it's pretty good except the whole love triangle thing,<br /> reminds me to much of that book about vampires.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome.game I never thought that I would find a game this awesome. all my friends.love it thanks imangi studios, Llc
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Had me hooked from beginning to end. Really cool to get a look inside the characters heads something the show just can't deliver
1481130331|5.0|It's not often that you read a book about the time just prior to, during and just after the Second World War that is based outside of either Britain or America. That's the first thing about The Luck of the Weissensteiners - it is unlike any other WWII fiction I have ever read, based on the experiences of a Jewish and Catholic family from Eastern Europe and the friends they make along the way.<br /><br />This is an absolutely riveting read from Christoph Fischer, one in fact that I lost sleep over because I just couldn't put it down. It all starts with a young Jewish girl, Greta, falling in love over books with the store clerk Wilhelm and turns into the most excellently told story about what happens to them and their loved ones.<br /><br />Fischer does not to go into the full horrors of Holocaust Europe, and he surely should be applauded for that, but there is enough there to put the reader firmly in mind and place, glimpsing the evil that men (and women) carried out. To have written it in such a way seems somehow more powerful, packs more of a punch to the emotions and senses.<br /><br />Rich in plot, with vibrant characters and wonderful storytelling, I really enjoyed this book and would certainly pick up another from the author.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game.  It has lots of cool effects and a ton of things to keep you engaged in the game.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|What ever happened to gangstar miami vindication because I have a kindle fire hd and it not in the app store but I had it on the regular kindle fire
B0042X9L6A|5.0|It's great to get the flash higher above the camera than the built-in flash and be able to have more control over lighting for my photos. It has a swivel head that can be adjusted to many different lighting situations. It's very versatile.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Appearance is good, and this app is easy to use.  However, the temperature is wildly inaccurate for my locations.  I suspect they may need to double-check the zip codes/locations.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it alot i really enjoy playing it...<br />wish I can play it on my phone though its really slow and it makes my phone freeze.... but playing it on the tablet is waaayy better!!!
0061950726|4.0|You might say I have a fascination with most things orphan-related. Raised by a father who was in an orphanage from age eight to 16, I am thankful that he was not one of the 200,000 plus children moved across the country on the orphan trains. Of course, that is not to say that some of those children on the trains were not eventually placed in good homes, likely better off than my father.<br /><br />As part of my basis for wanting to read Orphan Train, my father's history is key. However, I'm also working toward writing a novel based around the early orphanage system in the United States which, like the system attempting to protect the orphans riding the trains, did not always work as a safety net for their young lives and health.<br /><br />Christina Baker Kline has crafted a novel based in opposing times centered around two women generations apart in age, background, and history. And yet, these two women come together in a most unusual way to share their stories and lives, consummating in the most unlikely of friendships.<br /><br />Molly Ayer, almost 18 when the story opens, has run the gamut of foster homes and is about to \\"age out.\\" To keep herself out of juvenile hall, Molly knows she must take a community service project. Of all things, her assignment is to help an elderly woman clean her attic and possibly dispose of some of her past.<br /><br />The elderly woman, Vivian Daly, has a tumultuous past that she has managed to fade into blurriness. What little she does remember includes a boat trip across the ocean from Ireland, living in a less than healthy flat in New York, and then being placed on a train and being passed from home to home when things didn't work out.<br /><br />What Molly and Vivian don't realize at the outset is that their backgrounds have parallels that will bring them ever closer to one another in friendship as well as hope and healing.<br /><br />Kline's writing is luminous, historically correct as she switches between contemporary time and the Depression era, and her characters marvelously developed with distinct descriptive detail.<br /><br />My Recommendation: Orphan Train is a MUST READ if for no other reason than it highlights a time in our history that is little known and points to the broken system of foster care in our country today. You're going to love this book!d the Depression era, and her characters marvelously developed with distinct descriptive detail.<br /><br />My Recommendation: Orphan Train is a MUST READ if for no other reason than it highlights a time in our history that is little known and points to the broken system of foster care in our country today. You're going to love this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is just like minecraft it just takes about a few of the best things of minecraft which they have to do they can't sell their 20$ game for 6$ and if you get pocket launcher and pocket inventory editor which now works on kindle fire you can make even more the only bad thing is that there are so many lame minecraft scams don't buy any thing that has the word craft in it without check-in the reviews
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|streaming issues for all NON Netflix/youtube and googleplay streaming services.  spoke to tech support and stated that they are working on compatibility issues with HBOGo and other services
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting book, and well written, a bit long though, especially after you know what really happened, and I did not like the end:(
B008B403VS|5.0|I just bought one at TRU today retailed 139 but they said they will take away 20 if i take a survey, which i did. The TRU Version includes all that came with the takara line but with additional 4 more cassettes (Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, and buzzsaw.  I also have a 5 dollar reward coupon and the total i paid for including Tax is 125, the TRU i went is in Time Square. I hope that helps.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I've got to say no doubt this game is one of the best games I've played in my entire life
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Despite 800 + pages ...do not be intimidated. It goes too fast...one of those books you try and slow down so it won't finish. I liked this better than the first one which I found confusing as Follett skipped around too much and gave too much detail in subjects I didn't find that interesting. This second book however did not have a dull moment and I didn't skip a word.<br />He developed his characters better in this book as well and you had more affinity with them and cared about them. His detail about the war was incredible. I especially liked the part that he wrote about the resistance in Germany and you were on the edge of your seat hoping they didn't get caught.<br />I hope the third installment is as good as this one and look forward to seeing how the families move into the post war world.<br />Fabulous read!!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I choose this rating because they bring back the good days and now  they express their selves  what  they went through as a ki
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I have used Flipboard in IOS and loved it. On my Fire HD, it is so slow in loading the page that I've given up.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|I am using this external battery to give my GoPro Hero 3 camera extra life during shooting.  It is small and holds an excellent charge that outlives my memory cards.
B002AF4Y9G|5.0|This movie is not about my two favorite psychopaths Micky and Mallory Knox,  it's about how the media glorifies a horrible situation.  As they do now.  The cast is great !  If you like this movie I want to also recommend Quentin Tarantino's True Romance.  It's a true love story.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|cool app and somewhat addictive hoping for sequel. wish it was longer. I finished it in a few days maybe replay
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic!I love the game!!!! In the game you can compete on your horse and gain hems to buy new tack and new clothes!
B001P9KR94|1.0|How on earth did this snooze fest win Best Picture?  The movie was far from the best picture of 2008.  Slumdog Millionaire is slow and full of flashbacks and is based on the TV show, \\"Who Wants to be a millionaire\\" and the contestant is accused of cheating when he makes it all the way to final question.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a turkey.  One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  This movie was two hours and could have been condensed into 90 minutes.  Danny Boyle won best director for this boring movie? You have got to be kidding me.<br /><br />The Curious Case of Benjamin is a far superior film to this snooze fest.<br /><br />Skip this turkey.<br /><br />The Academy must have been sleeping when it awarded best picture to this disaster of a film.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME. The best multiplayer dungeon game ever. In game purchases little expensive but still a awesome game
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I loved the story and had read the book. My only complaint(living a few miles from Cold Mountain, NC) is that it was not filmed in the original location. Cold Mountain is beautiful and so are the people who reside around it.  It is pristine wilderness and barely touched by humans. I understand some parts of the film required different weather environments, but I firmly believe they could have found what they needed here in the good ol' USA
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|It was very fast paced.  I liked the way the various time lines held to the central story.  And everyone got a chance to die.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|An excellent book about outlier performance in all facets of life. The author introduces a new way of looking at successful people which is hidden from the public eye.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|A truly mind-numbing account of the genocidal damage wrought by the Milton Friedman school of laissez-faire economics, and how it has probably caused more deaths (and misery) both directly & indirectly, than the holocaust.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is the funniest book I have ever read. Ellen  brought me to tears several times from laughing so hard. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh and wants to be a happier and better person.
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|The look and feel of this game are great.  Halfway through I get stuck.  I have picked up everything I can.  I go to the hints and steps are missing.  Some are even in French.  Perturbed that I actually spent money on this app.  Thanks a lot!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a cool,funny,and awesome game with hilarious missions to do and really funny costumes to put on and have fun with
1572816295|5.0|The amount of detail put into every single card is astounding. The minor cards aren't shafted, as sometimes happens with tarot decks. The illustrations are spellbinding, and this deck connects with me on a much deeper, more intimate level than I'm accustomed to. Paulina's art is like a combination of Alice in Wonderland and Tim Burton, plus a special spice all her own.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app helps me keep up with every new features on Facebook it can do everything like the real Facebook but better I really consider you buying this app so get while it free

B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Look I'm going to keep it real with us bra but you might of got this game so you you could have a free uno game but seriously just pay for the money one cause this game sucks don't bye it first off there was an add about condoms don't bye this
B0034JKZ86|1.0|horrible movie, i cant believe this was made for kids. too scary with voodo, tarot cards and dark evil spirts, i had to fast forward most of this movie because of all the bad parts. What was disney thinking?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a very uplifting and. Emotional and tense At times . I really liked the format in which it was presented. I really liked the honesty the author spoke ofi.  It brought tears to my eyes to somewhat relate to the pain this child had to deal with at this age.
0062238868|5.0|Good reading.  Came when expected and packaged well. Always looking for good reading material for the bathroom since my kids will leave me alone in there.
0307743659|5.0|This book is one of the scariest books I have ever read, but this is to be expected from Stephen King.  Highly recommended read!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Connelly is an excellent author and this installment does not disappoint. I would recommend any of his books if you like books with flawed heroes that do the right thing.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I listen to this CD over and over.  Love the Gorilla song, but that won't make it to the radio..lol
B0089LOG02|5.0|It was very interesting and based on history.  I could hardly put it down once I started reading it. Excellent!
B003U69IX6|4.0|For the whole family.  A very turn on adding modern day locations.  We were very disappointed with the quality of the HD rental :(.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|Excellent writer, great story.  Haven't finished it yet, but don't have time to read it in 1 sitting or I would be finished!!
6305127646|5.0|I have a major crush on Val Kilmer, or I did at one time and am a hopeless romantic so I just really was entertained by this story! Loved the way Val changed his look all the time.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|The last three movies that I ordered ran fine, but G.I. Joe was so choppy that it made our eyes hurt. We watched it any way since I had paid for it.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink can do NO wrong in my book. I love her voice, think she's just awesome and SO happy she has a precious baby now!!!!

6305128952|5.0|I LOVE horses and was quite enamored with this story. I LOVE movies anyway and never purchase movies that I don't absolutely love. Hence, I have this one and was actually it to &#34;replace&#34; the VHS copy I did have.
006114665X|4.0|A very slow read; though the subject matter is tedious by its nature.  Haven't finished it yet so maybe I shouldn't review it!
B00003CX8U|5.0|I was purchasing this to replace the VHS copy I have. This was a DEEP movie and you can't get &#34;too deep&#34; for me so I just loved the film.
B0052FG750|5.0|Has all the hits.  Some collections manage to leave one or more out.  The sound quality is excellent and the set is nicely packaged with reproductions of the original LP sleeves included to hold the CD's.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|I LOVE movies anyway and just adored this movie. I'm a hopeless romantic and this fulfilled all of that in me!!  :o)  :o)  I LOVE the lead actress in the movie ~ Juliet!!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I don't put much weight in bestseller lists as my taste doesn't run parallel with others', but this little book is a pure delight. The way the truth of each character is slowly revealed with such tenderness that you know they are so deeply loved by the author. Ms. Joyce's use of language is a constant joy and not rivaled by many authors today. Part mystery, part a middle-age &#34;coming of age&#34; it leads our hearts toward hope in the face of normal life as well as uncommon happenstances.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Rge DVD was in very good shape. So was the cover. No problems at all. Enjoyed watching the movie. Very satisfied.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game!!  It is a good buy. Playing people online is fun but it sucks when there is no Internet connection. But it is a fun game to play when there is one.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I LOVED IT.it was so real he was shooting people at a strip club how amazing is that more like super amazing.
B004LOJPLQ|5.0|It's a great movie. It's based on a true story and stars two great actors. Wahlberg himself trained for a very long time for this role and it shows. You'd think he has been a professional boxer. The acting is great and the story is one heck of a great story to tell. Whether or not you're into boxing it's a great movie.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I make the best edit on this app so if you want good edits and collage DOWNLOAD THIS APP :) ;)
B001CEE1YE|4.0|Appears to be the Canadian release version. Still works fine in my Magnavox Blu-ray. Would be nice to have a heads-up, though. Otherwise, it's the same movies and special features.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|Gets a little repetitive, a little confusing, even for me lol. Graphics are not all that good.  Sorry little caterpillar :-)
B000MCH5TK|5.0|What an incredible narrative about the barriers we hide behind when confronted in less-desirable situations. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a wonderfully talented filmmaker. Personally, I think this should've won Best Picture at the Oscars over 'The Departed'.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Heard portions of this CD first on Pandora.  Fell in love and purchased two CDs, one for myself and one for a friend.<br />Neither of us has stopped playing it at least once a day since receiving it.  A must have for fans of Yo-Yo Ma and/or Morricone, or anyone else who just loves the best!  The compositions are beautiful and the combination of Ma's and Morricone's talents has created magic.
6304779356|3.0|Before I purchased this DVD in the description it was listed as very good condition.<br />When I finally received the item I was disappointed in the condition it was in.<br />The case was damaged and the DVD it self has many scratches and was dirty.<br />Dissapointing!!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Minor Spoilers through out:<br /><br />One of the biggest complaints is that \\"Oblivion\\" borrows a lot from other movies. It's true, but a rather hypocritical reason to trash a movie when in fact just about every sci fi movie has been significantly influenced by its predecessors. The fact that it borrowed from other movies didn't bother me- \\"Oblivion\\" still has its own voice and unique look.<br /><br />For all the critics who declare \\"Oblivion\\" is superficial, all style and no substance, I couldn't disagree more. \\"Oblivion\\" is an intelligent, symbolic and gorgeously filmed story. Like most intelligent sci fi, \\"Oblivion\\" explores age old philosophical questions of the human condition- do we have souls, do we have free will or are our fates predestined, etc.<br /><br />One of the major themes of Oblivion is that the voices of authority may not be as benevolent and as trustworthy as we' like to believe, and that individual thought and scrutiny are crucial to preserving freedom and humanity. The TET is a physical manifestation / representation of that power that influences us: religion, politics, the mass media - depending on how you look at it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jack and Victoria portray different ends of the power struggle: where he is eager, wants answers to the unknown, and is open to exploring new paths and breaking free from the chains that bind him, she is more concerned with doing what she is told, not rocking the boat, and sticking to the path that is set out before her without question or deviation. You could even take it a step futher and ask whether Jack and Victoria are merely acting the way they were MADE to act, or if they CHOOSE to act the way they do (the free will vs. predestination aspect). There is much beyond the surface story to enjoy and ponder on, for those who like that kind of thing. I can't wait to listen to the commentary for additional information.<br /><br />Also this movie is very pleasant on the eyes and ears. One of the most stunningHD movies I've seen to date, with a beautiful musical score by M83 to match. The entire film, from story to soundtrack to visual f/x, all pulls together like an eloquent poem, something that few films successfully manage to achieve. Movies like Oblivion certainly won't be liked by everybody, and not everyone will see the \\"eloquent poem\\" that I saw: Some of my friends were as disenchanted with it as much as I was mesmerized by it. As for me, I think it's one of the better pure sci fi films I've seen in awhile.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once upon a time I was a huge fan of Stephen King...huge! &#34;The Stand&#34; still ranks in my top 5 best books of all time. He lost me somewhere in the late '90's when his writing seemed to get formulaic and convoluted so I was hesitant to buy this book. I'm glad I did. From the first page to the very last I was completely and totally engaged.<br />What if...  What if you could go back in time and right a horrible wrong??? Not just the big wrong of a disillusioned political activist assassinating a president. But also smaller wrongs of a crippled girl, a family torn apart by mental illness and a woman tortured by an abusive spouse. What if you could fix them? And if you didn't fix it just right, you could bounce back and forth and try to fix it again and again and again. Total reset each time. And after all the time and effort you learn the hard way that the past does not want to be changed. What do you do?<br />Once I started this book, I couldn't stop reading it. My only complaint is that the story was so good that I was done with it far faster than I wanted to be.<br />So Stephen King has me once again. And I have another book to add to my all time favorite books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son whom is 11 asked to download this game app and since he has gotten it we all take turns playing it to see who can get the highest score. Pretty entertaining especially while we were on vacation.

B00C2VIA52|5.0|this is a wonderful TCG game. the cards are well designed. many heroes you can use as useful tool to build your fight strategy and deck style. I want to try more ethics.
0615782043|5.0|Since the dawn of time individuals have found poetry to be an acceptable way to present their passion for life, love and sex. The author has presented in modern language a combination of the Song of Solomon and Shades of Grey. At times his wording is straight up to the point and others hidden within symbolism. Not a book for the easily offended, but will speak to those who wish a ride of sensual diversion.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I'm loving this case!  I was worried since the Kindle Fire is already a little bulky in my opinion, but this case adds very little size!<br />And it works well!  Not three days after I got this case on my Fire, I dropped it down the stairs!  I kid you not, down a flight of stairs, and onto a stone entrance way.  I picked it up and it turned right now, and there is not a scratch anywhere on my device, or even on the case!  That's quality!<br /><br />I really like how the part that covers over the screen is super thin.  It can easily be folded behind the case for easy one handed use.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|If you liked the first, you may very well dislike this one, I did.  (SPOILER) Duke dies shortly after movie starts, none of the characters from the first movie are there.  Seeing Lady Jaye's ass was not necessary, not part of the &#34; world of GI Joe&#34; that was kid friendly.  Much like Megan Fox in the Transformer movies.  What happened to the Weather Dominator, or Sir Pentor, and on and on.  If they want to attract the crowd from the old 80's cartoon they are failing.
B00D0OR5EC|4.0|Suzanna Caysons story is not only about  Mental health in the 60's, it's a time capsule into the era itself.  At one time I coudl have been locked up (they did not have programs for learning disabled back then).  At least today I have the tools to succeed.  Will have to read more to get an full assessment of the book
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this app, I used to play this game all the time when I was younger. I just wish there were unlimited games.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|A film for all ages. Filled with love and courage.  The filming in China makes you feel as tho' you've been there. Beautiful.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I amazingly enjoyable read. I was surprised that I didn't want to put any of her books down. They are a fantasy that we'd all like to live in.
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nixs Sabriel, should be celebrated for its originality and rich depth of character; volumes of history imbued upon several powerful characters from which crashing and bubbling stories are boiled up, and then eeked out with such an excruciating, measured pace, it's hard to know whether you're running or walking.
B00CA4S37G|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the finest vinyl quality pressings of 2013. As stated above Gail Zappa had the LP pressed in Europe at Pallas which one of the finest pressing plants in the world. The recording was also made from the original analog  master tapes as stated on the bottom of the cover which was not the case of Freakout because those tapes had deteriorated long ago. The new vinyl sounds much better than my 1970's copy. It's quiet, more detailed, and transparent sounding, (sorry for the audiophile terms), which translated into a really entertaining listening experience on my turntable. the 1970's version sounded boxed-in and compressed in comparison which made me want to turn it off ASAP.  Not sure who the remastering engineer was but did a fantastic job on this one.<br />Highly recommended.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is a good basic and scientific calculator. As a free app there are three skins and if you get board with them you can pay .99 and get more. I have this app on my windows 8 ultra book as well as my Kindle fire HD. It responds well to the lightest touch and has a full scientific option. Snaps to a basic calculator on the ultra book and is easy to use. If you don't care about the look then no reason to purchase the paid version. But if you like change then the additional skins are very worth it!
B001E5CH0G|5.0|I have had this for a few years and I thinks it's time I said something about it. I love it so much, that it is the only thing that will bring me out of a horrible funk, or make my worst day wonderful. I watch this movie year round. It doesn't matter how bad I feel, I'm laughing pretty good as the story starts building. The antics, and it continues, then I'm in hysterical laughter every time I watch it at the same part of the story. I will not ruin it for those who have not seen it. It even gives me a few tears due to the feel good moments it credits to the joy of Christmas. Highly recommended to everyone with a sense of humor, and a need for a little romance.<br /><br />I also have to mention that the Blu-Ray extras are worth going through. I enjoyed them very much.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|. The romance and intensity is there with every turn of the page. I couldn't put the book down and when I would I was just waiting till the next time I'd find a break in my day to continue it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game that is fun to play and u don't  get bored because of the many games. I haven't stopped playing for hours.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|needs work!!! tapping is two or three times!!! have to reboot all the time!!! a lot of trouble sometime worse than ours!!! you need to check very thing in the game!!! very fun game when it works!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've used it for a little while, mostly from my iPad, and it does what it says it does and VERY EASILY!  Set up was a total breeze, so much so, it'll set a new standard.  But it's a little glitchy in that when I push pause on my iPad, it sometimes takes awhile to actually pause.  Also tonight I couldn't get it to connect, but it had a software update to do, which didn't actually help it.  I'd love to give this 5 stars, but there are still too many kinks, but I figure these will be worked out and this little cheap device will be the gold standard!  Worked much easier than my Roku and the picture quality was excellent and I was using is on a small flatscreen in my kitchen.  Good work Google!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like how after each play, you get the coins no matter what, but I think say if we were on level 3, we should be able to start with the mileage we had beat in level 2.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Cool concept but not overly well done. Wasn't a waste of time but certainly can't say I loved it. It was okay.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|From what I have played you dont get to choose the horse. You start out with one unless ya buy one but the game is fun and the more money the more accessories for your horse!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlene Harris knew this book was rubbish. She did not clear up all the story lines nor give us clear ending. I was completely disappointed with her handling of the characters. She lived with them for 13 years, so have we.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game. Now I can play it and not her my cousin complaining that she lost!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I wish there was a set of preferences to change the speed of the coins appearing in my bank. Game has a lot of ads.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This is the best way to dj! I love it I'm on it everyday to dj! Looking for a app to learn to dj chose this one it's worth it.
0756655307|5.0|I ordered this for my son on his birthday. Thankfully, he had an Amazon wish list. I had this and other items shipped to his home. He was surprised and allegedly &#34;giggled like a girl&#34; when he opened the surprise package.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Ready for part 2. Very addictive . Could stop playing. All though I would of liked to see more levels .

0345529057|5.0|I started watching the series on HBO and just had to read the book's and i have to say its more than worth it for the price makes it a steal.
0689835604|5.0|My little one loves lifting the flaps on the pages.  I think it has helped her learn her body parts.  So cute!
B00004RJ71|5.0|would have preferred to get this masterpiece on blu- ray but it is what it is. still one of my favorite movies of all time and would recommend it for almost anyone.
B0000640VO|4.0|I love the quirkiness of this movie.  The mischievousness, innocences, and love of mystery in the main character makes this very entertaining.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|It is a quick read and I generally enjoyed it, but too pollyannish for more than three stars.  It could use with a few main character deaths.  I'll likely read the next one, but perhaps not much further if some if the love interest triangles within triangles have no resolution.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|When a body of work is excellent.... The problem lies with the artist to met or excel it. Good luck with that.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Always clutching and not updating emails.  Free is still not good enough.  They should pay me for wasting my time with this.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|This is an excellent reflection of the evolution of an artist.  Yes, this album is good... But it is not as good as the following piece of work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game I have so much fun playing it. the best part is the minions I love them. you should get this game.
159514188X|4.0|This book is well written. Hard to believe its the authors first book, he is very talented. I feel as a parent and a person who has worked many years in Mental Health this book should be required at all middle school and high schools.<br />The book has a great lesson for everyone, BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER. I did not feel like Hannah was blaming others for her actions, she is just letting others know how a person's actions can affect everyone around them.<br />Everyone could learn a lesson from this book!!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Romance is another...  Not a bad track on this CD...  I brought it to work and often get comments from people in the lobby asking who IS this?!!!  Very nice ~
B00CZXIVNI|4.0|This is a great addition for any Big Time Rush fan. While I prefer their second album, this is a perfectly danceable pop CD. Enjoyable to say the least. If you're a fan of BTR or just great pop music, I'd suggest given this record a spin.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|cool game its really fun but the price on the things in the store are really high because of how much you really get
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I have to say, I missed FOB and was glad to hear about this record. I was not let down. Great songs, great guests, and the same wonderful lyrics that Fall Out Boy fans know and love.
B00CTNUMPO|3.0|Oliver & Company is finally on blu-ray and I, for one, am so thrilled! The release certainly isn't perfect, but it's an improvement over the past releases on DVD. I would be interested to know how much of an overhaul Oliver got for his new blu transfer. Certain scenes could be rough, certainly, but there in a blink-and-you'll-miss-them sporadic appearance. For the most part, the image is crisp and clear with stable color and a certain amount of depth. If this isn't the best that Disney can do (and I hesitate to say it is, knowing Disney's track record with what they consider their lesser film entries), then it's a fine place to start! I can only imagine what a full overhaul would bring out in this lovely film! The sound quality more than makes up for what the pictures lacks, however! Booming bass, crisp dialogue, suitably immersing surrounding noise.. Very, very good job on the audio Disney! All in all, a middling entry on the technical front. If you're a fan or a first time buyer, Oliver and Company deserves a spot in your library!
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|After more than 15 years of listening to this band evolve, I was not let down with this album. Great songwriting, wonderful pop and r&b hooks. Great addition for any fan of the band or of great music by singer-songwriters. There are veins of good old fashioned soul in this album as well as a couple of rock anthems...hence the name.<br />I would recommend giving this album a try, fan of Hanson or otherwise. This album just might turn you into one.
B004SBX112|5.0|This game has my favorite pig-getter, the Mighty Eagle. It swoops down toward the sensor wherever it lands, hits it, shakes the ground getting EVERY pig, & gets everything in its path. In Year Of The Dragon you get a free dragon that's even MORE powerful than a Mighty Eagle. & DON'T forget the golden eggs (there's TEN in Easter Eggs) & the Mighty Eagle feather levels!!!!! For some reason we got the Mighty Eagle FOR FREE even though I don't know why. BUY THIS RIGHT NOW & BUY THE GOLDEN EGG GUIDE WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) (:<br /><br />P.S. For best results, buy the Mighty Eagle with it:)<br /><br />:) (:
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Fun story of magic. The puzzles were great some easy some a bit more challenge but non so frustrating that u give up. Love that there are  bunch of different types of puzzles too..
140006922X|5.0|The book is well-written and even-handed. The notes provide the argument so as to keep the book flowing, which is normal practice. Aslan's argument is researched and interesting. Anyone giving this book below 3 stars doesn't know how to approach a book.
B008JFUNWS|5.0|I am a big fan of Logan Lerman (Percy) and I am pleased to say that, just like every other movie he's in, Logan failed miserably to disappoint.  His acting was phenomenal as usual. He is a brilliant actor that can play any type of roll perfectly. AS was the rest for the cast, very well done.  I was a little disappointed that they re-cast Pierce Brosnan's role.  But maybe they needed the money for effects.  Which by the way where breathtaking.  The story was very personal and oriented toward loyalty and the importance of family. The baddies where satisfyingly scary and very well rendered in CGI (you couldn't do these kinds of creatures with live action models)  and they had a wicked sense of humor.  I like that Percy was not seen as everyone's idol, more as a normal person. He wasn't held up on a pedestal or anything.  Overall I think this was a worthy sequel to another brilliant movie.  A+!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great fun, good graphics. I'm glad this game finally came to kindle.  Can't stop playing it! I recommend this game to everyone.
1616550414|5.0|recommended for any Zelda fan, especially anyone who want's to go into art or illustration (yo, art student, listen up, i know you like Zelda). the character designs, and the the different drafts and revisions of them, are all contained in this book, and it's kinda awesome to see all in one place, there's a lot you could learn. especially since the zelda franchise has embraced so many different visual styles over the years. also, the thing is just sexy, look at it... so sexy.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Simple and unimaginative  unimaginative the air and I was rowi to THE  the color of life in the snow leopard
0307895475|5.0|If you can't find an item, finish a quest, or slay a beast after reading this tome, then it can't be done.<br />Easy to follow tips, tricks, and hints.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|Big Blue teddy-bear like Sully is \\"Top Scarer\\" at the inter-dimensional utility company that collects children's screams to power the monster world. His zany sidekick Mike, a one-eyed green ball, fails his main task continually, which is to file paperwork with the frog-like flat-voiced Roz. Jealous second-place scarer, Randall, reveals he is willing to cross the line to make it to the top. But when the human and monster worlds meet, Sully and Mike uncover a sinister plot and reveal the truth about humans, turning the monster world on its ear.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Just like the title of this review says. That's all it really comes down to. The soundtrack is very eloborate and techno feeling add well. Personally I just didn't like any of the action scenes and the story line was also rather bland and slow to me.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Start to finish...soul wrenching, uplifting, amazing. One of my favorite albums of all time. Not one track disappoints. A gem.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|She is a few weeks old and this tem is great from white noise because it has a bunch of sounds that you can go thru and find the one that the baby really like...  Frogs and Birds in the Woods...  Go figure she just loves it and sleeps Like A Baby.
B00CC1K320|1.0|AFTER 2 DAYS OF YEARS HAVE SEEM TO USE WITH IT, AFTER MORE THAN 40 USD PAY FOR THIS PRODUCT AFTER 2 DAYS TO USE THIS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION, I RETURN TO NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT MANUFACTURER.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I just want to kill the birds and trash this App... Oh I did,  funny me.  Yep that is what I did, I played it for a long time and now I have trashed it/un installed it tossed it a way like a bad molded piece of bread. Yep, did break a sweat and didn't cry one tear. Just pressed that button and BAM it was gone, like yesterday's news, not wanted nor needed.  You have to figure if it is what you want to waist your Memory Space on.  Good Luck with that.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Great book. Ivan finally gets credit. Nice job. Twelve more words required but that's all I really have to say. Oh well.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Not sure what I can really do with this App.  It appears to be useful but it is quite involving, so I will have to review more about it later.  But for now the cost can't be beet.... lol
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I use this a lot and it's very handy.  I would recommend this to a friend.  keep up the good work.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game look forward to the next level of this game<br />Easy to play on my kindle will get more games from this site
B003O86FMW|4.0|I feel a few years behind, but I couldn't wait yo come home to read. Excited to finish but sad to end
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game I really like playing it like to hearing about the ability for cold war and have been a resume and I don't underNourished and the ability for a resume but underNourished the carrots to hearing about ten minutes ago by an average person in fairviewhieghts I
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very much enjoyed this easy read that makes you think about when life was that simple and yet still so complicated.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|first..soundcloud doesn't load on the phone. then not correctly on kindle..frames wont close. I download this app. made for kidsm NOT creators. its clear every uploading site is slowly backing out from common people uploading. this no different..a mess of download. but zero means to UPLOAD except recording live audio. youtube is pushing down hits on locals..and now THIS I HATE THIS CRAP
B007V65R54|5.0|This is a very easy to understand book. The examples are very clear, the list of references supporting the author's statements and conclusions very complete.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book was just as good as the first, if not better. I can't wait to read the next one.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Full of humor. A good yarn. Funny how things in life just sort of work out. Enjoy the journey. To life...
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is AWESOME!!! It  kept me in even more suspense than the first book. Just wen I thought it was try over it only just began....I recommend this book to anyone with common sense!!! =]
B008AVXGA2|5.0|The story begins with two young kids whose parents are going away and leaves them in care of their old aunt. What follows afterwards is the revelation of a hidden secret, and a series of surprises coupled with magic, and an exciting adventure with the mythical firebird. I can't say how much I enjoyed 'Firebird: Adventure One.' This book will make a great movie. I can only imagine how much fun and excitement it will be experiencing the story in visuals. Highly recommended for parents who are looking for a fun, exciting adventure to read to their children and grandchildren.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|So far, so good. The clean master app has done what it said it would. It cleared a lot of junk off my kindle fire. Thanks.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I shall only comment on two aspects of this movie, as there are so many other reviews here which give better insight into it.  First, let me emphasize that THIS version; the 2007 British cast is far superior to the 2010 remake with Chris Rock.  While the 2010 remake has an identical storyline and identical character types, the humor and fun of the story - which is played out identically in the British version - is completely lost to poor acting and weak characters in the remake.  The remake has all of the substance of the British original, but none of the charm or style.  Stick with the 2007 British original; the funniest and most endearing comedy in years.  Secondly, I want to point out the wonderful appeal of Peter Dinklage - who plays the same character in both versions - and his enormous talent, which - for me - is the highlight of both versions.  Death At  A Funeral (2007) is excellent.  Avoid the remake and see the best original.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|For everyone that has kids and a Grandfather this is a must have in your collection, you laugh, you cry, you cheer for them and feel alive after the movie ends.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Just like Bruno's previous CD, this is an awesome CD as well.  I'm wearing out this CD as well because I play it so much.  It was awesome to see him live in concert singing some of these songs which brought it life for me when I listed to it in my car.  Great CD!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a movie that has everything for every person in the family, You just cant take your eyes off of the TV.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I will have to buy my second CD of this CD as I'm wearing it out with daily play.  I just love this CD.  Bruno Mars is awesome!
B00785P2QC|4.0|pretty cool but I think you should be able to use the cash you make from your businesses to expand.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|It's good until u get to 3rd level and the guy just falls to the floor and nothing works to fix it
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|just would like to be able to trace photos<br />I bought this app on my ipad and doesn't<br />have all tools that ipad have.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is a high quality, simple iPhone case. I thought the soft plastic would make it a pain to take in and out of my pocket, but that hasn't been a problem.
0525953728|4.0|A good story book.  If we shut him when he was not armed, Ben Latin or anyone else, it is a murder.  I can not justified.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I SAW my daughter play this game and fell in love with it. It is very relaxing and a lot of fun to play. I would recommend it for all ages.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Very similar to the first two games, which isn't a bad thing, but now with two monsters to feed! Highly recommended to any fans of the originals.
B009D0LBRO|2.0|Having beaten Rayman Origins I bought this game the week it came out.  I love the game... but this latest update added these strange ads.  I paid for the app.  I should not have to suffer through ads.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The little minions are so cute . I would request if you like little yellow minions it's perfect for you PLEASE PLAY
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|The movie starts out strong, with some good laughs and quite a few chuckles. After about 45 minutes, the movie starts to drag with laughs much further apart. Plus, the story line gets a little dragged out. By the last half our I found myself forcing to finish the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was great! I never wanted to put it down! Read it in Two days. Well done Suzanne Collins
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a great little game.  It is quick, cheap and fun and yet still has a nice level of strategy.  I won't get to in depth on the back story of the game but essentially you are trying to end up being the suitor that wins favor with the princess so that she will allow you to court her.  You do this by being the player who has the closest connection to the princess and will therefore deliver your love letter to her the quickest and you are awarded a little red cube.  Once you gain a majority of the cubes you win the game, but the amount needed to get that majority depends on the number of players.  Every turn you will draw a card and play a card.  The card played is put face up in front of you for all to see and its special ability applies for this turn.  You will need to use deduction and strategy to try and outwit the other players and get your love letters to the princess and who knows, you might just get that Happily Ever After ending.
B003RV43X4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It is much better than Wrath of the Titans.  Clash is the only one worth watching.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love this CD. I listened to it from Albuquerque to Flagstaff. Fogerty sings his older, well known Credence songs, and a couple of new one's. It is so worth it, and I'm so glad he's back on the music scene, in a big way! He sounds good, and he brings in Bob Segar, Kid Rock, Brad Paisley, Alan Jackson, Keith Urban, and Jennifer Hudson, among others. The CD is fun, bright, and bluesy. And awesome.
B00377E5R2|4.0|Light-hearted entertainment and does justice to the original with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden! Greg Kinnear is superb in this!
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|I am not going to provide a movie synopsis as there plenty of reviews which summarize this film. Instead this will be an attempt to focus why i like it.<br />  Out of the movies released to date(five so far with the sixth and final announced), RE: Apocalypse is my favorite. Not only did Writer/Producer Paul W.S. Anderson learn from his successful first installment, but was able to up the ante in a way that worked. In addition to being able to intensify the action from the first movie, I felt he maintained a story line that allowed characters to develop - which is something that has been virtually non-existent in RE: Afterlife and Retribution. With only a couple of exceptions, such as the cemetery scene (How did the T-Virus get to the interned corpses to infect them?), I enjoyed seeing the various responses to the outbreak by the main characters i.e. losing a close friend, being abandoned by your employers, dealing with overwhelming number of the undead and so on. There was more at stake than just a small elite team of soldiers in this film, it was a chance to stop the T-Virus before it infected the global population.<br />Milla Jovovich establishes herself in a rather elite company of female actresses (Angelina Jolie, Kate Beckinsale and Michelle Yeoh to name a few more) who can pull off the believable action heroine. The supporting cast of Oded Fehr and Sienna Guillory for action with Mike Epps for comic relief worked for me. Thomas Kretschmann did a good job as the Umbrella man put in charge of containing the outbreak that turns people in zombies - yet using the situation as a the prefect test for making sure various top secret projects of the corporation, such as Project ALICE are feasible and potentially profitable.<br />I admit I prefer the film series to the video games and the animated films so the fact the character Alice is purely invented for the movie does not bother me. I do watch the Extras and Special features on discs, especially deleted/extended scenes. For RE: Apocalypse I thought the extent and subject matter of Special Features was very good, such learning about the idea to give each character their own specific type of firearms so you identify it with him or her and watching how various stunts were designed and executed in the six-part 'Making of' documentary.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|One of my top 10 all time favorite movies and one of a very select few that I could watch over and over. An ensemble and brilliant cast! Timeless!
030758836X|1.0|The book they sent me was water-damaged and stained.  The jacket was not even worth keeping.  I was very disappointed with the quality of the book.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|This film will captivate your heart and lift your spirits in a way that few other movies will. The cast is the best of the best and I have no doubt that every actor in this film took the role in order to act in true art around true artists... every aspect of this film is first quality and wonderful. You will never forget this film. You will add it to your library and watch it again.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love using the ebay app, easy to understand and bid or buy now option. love it! def recommend, I use this app all the time
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I must say I really enjoyed this game. The puzzles were fun,though I didn't understand some, skipped those. The clues were helpful, glad they were there. Some of the games were too dark, hard to see where everything was, like the ones with the letters, had to use a magnifying glass to see where to place them. Certain areas of the game could be lightened a little. I liked that you had to play a few games before you could save them, it made me take time to relax and play. altogether a good game I highly recommend.
B004PHE9F6|3.0|Still nice to watch, although the action is different from today's action movies (no computer effects at all here...). Considering that,  a remarkable film.
1939416019|4.0|I very much enjoyed A Quest of Heroes by Morgan Rice. It is a great fantasy novel that will keep anyone's interest that loves kings, swords, princesses, and the sort. I liked each character in their own way. but the main character Thor can be a little frustrating. On several occasions all he would have to do is speak his mind and things could have possibly turned out better for him. Something I noticed was that the whole Kingdom seems to have a short memory of who he is and what he has done on several occasions. A Quest of Heroes reminds me of so many different stories. It is a combination of the mythology of Thor, the story of Harry Potter, and Michael G. Mannings Mageborn series. It has several things in common with each novel, but because of its difference is why I enjoyed it. Can't wait to read book two and continue on Thor's adventure. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially from ages 8-13.

B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is a master and perfect at performing with the acustic guitar. With electric guitars you can hid minor mistakes, but an acustic captures even the tinyest flaw. Joe plays at a level that i dont think the angles in heaven can match. You may think im going over the top but the reality is im probably not doing him justice.

B00E9PXI3S|1.0|I usually check out the films of Brian DePalma,(probably not so much in the theater of late, they're usually a little disappointing) but, I see all of them at some point, because he has what seems to be a sincere love of the cinema and his forebears in the field of suspense directing. Some criticisms that commonly apply to his filmic oeuvre are stylish to a fault, slavishly imitative of other directors, tenuous or vacuous plots,and so on. But I have never, ever, used the description BORING until now with \\"Passion\\" definition of which is: is suffering; and that is the way that I felt watching this movie. . .

B00821OW8K|5.0|I've read and mulled over many of the high numbers of reviews on this series. Most of the negatives are just to be negative as I see it. The positive reviews are well thought out and accurate for the most part, Why this is another alien vs the human race plot? Come on folks! It's entirely possible that will happen!<br /><br />Noah portrays a believable prof in unbelievably difficult situations - and rises to the occasion. Of course he does, he's the main protagonist! The human element, with human needs and wants is also well portrayed. I doubt in real life it would be any different. Of course there would be times of non-action - and others?  It's all about being a human being and retaining that special manner. In any way possible, considering the odds. The story certainly allows the participants to rise to the occasion. My question is would we really behave that well. Would we watch out for others...or take care of ourselves only, ultimately wiping us all out and leaving Earth to cockroaches. I don't know, and that's a question that couldn't possibly be answered unless this very thing happened.<br /><br />I am particularly impressed in the manner of behavioral portrayal. Things would change. For children especially, for their parents certainly, for everyone, definitely.<br /><br />If anyone knows how to blow up Voyager? Please do. That was one of the biggest mistakes we ever made as far as the human race. In my humble opinion, of course. If anything resembling this story line were to happen I'd bet everything Voyager as the initiating factor(s).<br /><br />Again, if anyone disbelieves there are bad guys from other planets/galaxies? Not bright. If we can evolve, so could other species. That's simple math. There may be good guys - but would they come here for brunch? Not likely, Good guy aliens? Probably stay at home. Bad guy aliens? Yep. They'd come to eat us in one way or another. We certainly couldn't be the only species to have used up their planet, could we? Again, simple math.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg did well once again. I will buy every single season, and enjoy each episode.n, simple math.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg did well once again.

B00540G3G6|4.0|3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, DVD, and iTunes Digital Copy. What more can you want? For the environmentally conscious, you'll be happy to know that the DVD and Digital Copy are combined into the same disc, so less plastic! As for the 3D version of this movie, I wasn't that impressed. The most impressive scene was toward the end when it snows in Halloweentown. The snow jumps right out of the screen and really has that \\"cool factor\\" but then it goes away in the next scene. The majority of the scenes has very minor 3D effects. For the occasional novelty of it, watch the 3D. But for the majority of the time I watch this movie, I'll stick with the 2D Blu-ray. If the entire movie jumped out of the screen, similar to the snow scene, then the 3D would be more worth it.

B000001F7R|5.0|Back in 1980, A guy who worked at The National Record-Mart told us that this new group was gonna be big one day and he was right. He recommended this album and we bought it and like it on it's first play through. The album starts off with a great opener with \\"Rock Brigade\\" with \\"Hello America\\" following. What's odd about Def Leppard was they made it big in the States before they did in their homeland. Every song on this album rocks but what impresses me now more than it did then is \\"Overture\\". Great Guitar work here and I like how the lead ends on one note which fade's before they return to the main part of the song. I'm no expert on writing reviews but I highly recommend this album, still my favorite of theirs. Far different than \\"Hysteria\\" but then again \\"Hysteria\\" didn't come out for another 7 years. One thing I would like to add is I wish they would remaster this one and make a deluxe addition of this album like they did with \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria\\". Same goes for their second album \\"High And Dry\\".

B00122M2QU|5.0|Cavalera Conspiracy, the much hyped-about supergroup involving members of Sepultura, Soulfly, Nailbomb, and Gojira, released an debut in 2008 entitled \\"Inflikted.\\" And it is no secret that this album sounds like...er, well...an amalgamation of all four bands involved. Nevertheless, it is an excellent debut, and one that holds boatloads of promise and potential.<br /><br />Skinsman Igor Cavalera lays the foundation for the songs with brutal blasts and thrash beats, and four-stringer Joe Duplantier completes the rhythm section by laying down some bass lines which a re very steady and flowing, if however unobtrusive bass lines (Duplantier keeps his nose out of trouble most of the time, and only occasionally -- like in the songs' breakdowns -- can be said to be prominent in the mix.) But for the most part, though, this is, unsurprisingly, the guitarists show. Max Cavalera and Marc Rizzo come up with some of the all-time best and most infectious riffs of their long and storied recording career, and augment them with memorable leads and exceptional solos.<br /><br />\\"Inflikted\\" is first-and-foremost a groove-oriented thrash metal album, but it is one that is peppered with strong death metal elements. Add some undeniable hardcore and yes, even Nailbomb-reminiscent grindcore influences to the mix, and the end result is one beastly and b-b-brutal monster of an album, and one that is influenced equally by all four bands involved in its recording.<br /><br />The pulsing pound of the title song makes it a very rousing and moving set opener, and one that is bristling with catchy riffs and moshable rhythms. It also drops in a couple of great (and really ripping) guitar solos, too -- the first of which is especially of note, as it is sounds like it is a sweep-picked solo. \\"Sanctuary\\" follows this up, and does a more-than-sufficient job of doing so, as it evokes \\"Beneath The Remains\\"-to-\\"Arise\\"-era Sepultura, with its great, grinding riffs, throbbing bass, and positively palpable intensity/energy. \\"Terrorize\\" plays like an enthralling thrash rave-up, what with its steadily-building momentum and increasing levels of heaviness, and all. It is also highlighted by a deft drum intro, some well-placed, squealing pinch harmonics, and fine bit of unorthodox soloing. \\"Black Ark\\" boasts some excellent guitar solos and subtle yet noteworthy melodic guitar lines, but this track is mostly of note for having steady, industrial-strength chugging riffs and adherent, moshable groove coursing throughout. And some solid bass lines help to make rhythms really strong, throbbing, and pulsating, too. And the drumming is also very noteworthy, here, as it varies from really quick drum fills, to flavorful tribal beats, to an extended, energetic percussion outro. And finally, \\"Black Ark\\" is also highlighted by a guest vocalist (Ritchie Cavalera, Max's step-son, chips in, here, with a few cool, deathly growls.)<br /><br />\\"Ultra-Violent\\" is none too shabby of a track, either, as it boasts nasty, punching guitar licks, a solid bass bottom, and thundering skins slamming (and not to mention a ripping and ascending guitar solo, too). Rex Brown (of Pantera and Down fame) also has a cameo, here, laying down an epic bass solo. But as good as \\"U.V.\\" is, \\"Hex\\" is even better. It shoots out of the gate with a surprisingly explosive and decapitating barrage of thrashing, blistering double bass drumming, thus making it a big standout song. The next couple of  cuts, \\"The Doom Of All Fires,\\" with its absolutely blistering riffage and tasty, wah-drenched soloing, and \\"Bloodbrawl,\\" which possesses an even heavier old-school hardcore vibe/influence (including a powerful gang-shouted refrain), both sound like they could be \\"Chaos A.D.\\"-era b-sides. The only thing that prevents them from being total Sepultura knock-offs is that the latter tune does have an unexpectedly awesome melodic outro, and one that is complete with a gorgeous string arrangement, some bouncy floor tom percussion, andeven what sounds like a lute (!).<br /><br />But immediately following that, \\"Inflikted\\" returns to its brutal roots with \\"Nevertrust\\" overflowing with tons of amazing riffs and great solos (which help to add some much needed melody to the mix). Indeed, this is one brutally brutal, furious, heads-down, charging, circle-pit-ready thrasher, and a blast of white-hot rage. It is also a very rebellious number, too, and a rant against rednecks (it boasts lines such as \\"never trust a redneck!\\" and \\"never trust the politricks!\\"), thus making it sound like it could the very apt follow-up to Soulfly's 2000 anthem \\"Primitive.\\" Next up comes \\"Hearts Of Darkness,\\" which sounds like it is tailor-made for headbanging, with its insanely catchy chug and powerful, hardcore-esque gang shouts. And a yell of \\"un, dos, tres, qua!\\" introduces the next song, \\"Must Kill,\\" the album's closing blast, before it delves into strong chug and churn riffage and smashing blast beats.<br /><br />True, \\"Inflikted\\" is not totally without flaw. For one, Max's lyrics seem a bit repetitive and simpleton-esque, at times (his choruses, however potent as they may be, utilize an only limited vocabulary.) Plus, it would be a long shot to say that this album bears many surprises or challenging arrangements that get better with repeat listens. But do not let that little complaint dissuade you from thinking that Cavalera Conspiracy have done anything but produce one heckuva record, here. And even with a seemingly endless amount of hype and fuss surrounding it, C.C. have made good on their promise to deliver an excellent and very satisfying slab of death/thrash metal. And for those of you out there who are, for some odd reason, not satisfied with Max's recent works in Soulfly (i.e. see \\"Dark Ages\\" and \\"Conquer\\"), you are strongly advised to purchase a copy of \\"Inflikted.\\" Why? Because it is a fact, ladies and gentlemen, that Cavalera will never again join Igor in the ranks of Sepultura. But this is easily the closest that the man will ever (and I do mean EVER!) come to returning to form.even what sounds like a lute (!).<br /><br />But immediately following that, \\"Inflikted\\" returns to its brutal roots with \\"Nevertrust\\" overflowing with tons of amazing riffs and great solos (which help to add some much needed melody to the mix).

B0084B5TK8|3.0|Bram Stoker wrote Dracula in 1897. It was the year that marked Queen Victoria's 60th year on the throne, the birth of Frank Capra (Director of It's A Wonderful Life), the death of the German composer Johannes Brahms and the foundation of Italian football giants Juventus. 1897 also saw the Australian cricket team defeat England 4-1 in the Ashes. An interesting year then, but not the most interesting. I feel the same could be said for Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br /><br />The first section of the book where Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to assist Count Dracula in making preparations to buy a property in England is atmospheric, creepy and somewhat disturbing. Unfortunately, this only comprises less than a quarter of the book. The rest of it is a combination of diary entries and notes from the various other characters in the novel (including Harker but not including Count Dracula) and as such is reminiscent of other Victorian novels such as The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins.<br /><br />Unlike The Moonstone, I found the characters in Dracula to be largely insipid and one dimensional. There is the gung-ho American, the stiff-upper lip Englishman, the love-lorn Doctor, the courageous Lord and women who do nothing but adore these men in a thoroughly pathetic fashion. And then there is Van Helsing - a 72 year old Dutchman who is a self-proclaimed expert in Vampires and a sort of supernatural Sherlock Holmes. I have to say that I found the passages from Van Helsing to be at times unreadable with the author obviously attempting to proclaim Van Helsing's foreign roots by having him write his entries with  constant errors in grammar. For a world-renowned Professor I would have thought he would have been a better linguist to be honest.<br /><br />I found the writing to be stilted at times and the vehicle of the various diary entries serves only to negate any possible tension that is created. The singular exception is Renfield - a wonderful character whose demise really signifiedfor me the demise of my interest in the book.<br /><br />For a book that is supposed to be the seminal book on Vampires, It seems the invocation and general worship of 'God' is more prominent than any blood sucking fiend. Stereotypes abound.God is all-powerful, men are strong and brave, women are fortunate to be in such company and any foreign threat is to be disposed of in the name of virtue.<br /><br />\\"How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it not do when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and both he and Mr Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely.\\"<br /><br />In summary, I found Dracula to be lacking in drama, humour and flow. It was overwrought at times, melodramatic and, for a huge fan of 19th Century Literature such as myself, ultimately annoying. It had none of the depth and emotion of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley nor any of the poignancy of Jekyll and Hyde by Robert Louis Stephenson. The timing of the publication is what I think has propelled Dracula into the public conscience, coming as it did at the beginning of the film industry - the perfect example of 'right time, right place', where sensationalism and shock value would in time overcome any deficiency in style substance and worth. The Daily Mail was published for the first time, just a year earlier, in 1896. A co-incidence? Maybe...
B00BG08FKK|4.0|I find this set quit enjoyable.  I held off due to some complaints, but am glad I eventually picked it up.  They may come out with a more complete set down the road and if they do, I will just buy it again.  Who knows when that might be.  In the meantime, I am enjoying the heck out of it.  The only real complaint I have, is that during the climax of On My Own there is a clicking sound that I believe to be the rain hitting the microphone when recorded.  It is very distracting.  Hopefully, they will fix that in future releases.  Otherwise, great set, though not complete.  Then again, only the complete symphonic orchestra recording is complete.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|Universal Studios Home Entertainment brings \\"Oblivion\\" to Blu-ray and DVD for those who didn't get a chance to see it in theaters. Many people find Tom Cruise to be an acquired taste these days after his couch-jumping antics and Scientology beliefs became public knowledge. However, this beautiful sci-fi gem shouldn't be pushed away solely because he's the lead actor.<br /><br />Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are the last remaining humans on the war-torn Earth. They're assigned to watch over powerful machines used to collect what's left of the planet's natural resources for use on a moon being colonized by the survivors of an alien invasion. As the job is wrapping up and it grows closer to time for them to leave and move on to their new lives, bizarre dreams and occurrences awaken Jack's suspicions about his mission and who he is.<br /><br />Although the story isn't completely unique, \\"Oblivion\\" manages to borrow different concepts from several classic sci-fi films and blends them together to create something new and entertaining. Director Kosinski does a great job of paying homage to the genre, bringing to mind the visually stunning films of the 1970s and 1980s such as \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" \\"Alien,\\" and \\"Outland.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, adult language, and sexual situations. There's really nothing too horribly objectionable to be found. The box art states there's some nudity, but I didn't see where any actual body parts were shown.<br /><br />The audio and video presentations for \\"Oblivion\\" will leave home audiences stunned. The crystal clear picture shows off the different landscapes and familiar monuments which have been laid waste by war. M83's score brings every sequence of drama and action to life through an immaculate 7.1 surround sound mix.<br /><br />There are a few special features found on the Blu-ray version of \\"Oblivion.\\" Audio commentary is provided by Director Joseph Kosinski and actor Tom Cruise. \\"Promise of a New World\\" is a 5-part \\"Making of\\" documentary that clocks in at 48 minutes. We also get four deleted and alternate scenes. A 5.1 surround presentation of M83's isolated score is included as well.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" is an exciting mix of blockbuster action and sci-fi intellect. It's well-acted and serves as a tribute to the groundbreaking genre films of the past.

B004QX07G4|3.0|I purchased this for my Kindle because I'm an Ellen fan. It's okay. The book is written just like how she speaks, on topic, off topic, on topic, side note, back on topic...etc.
1451668945|5.0|I have been reading Mary Higgins Clark's books for years.  They are so easy to read. You can't put them down.  Her characters are so interesting.  Her books are a must read!
B008602KQI|2.0|Well its a okay movie butt if your one who thinks about real life detail and have a keen eye many things will bug you in this movie, such as Katnis keeps her wood bow strong! When she stores it in a hollow tree, a wood bow in real life wood be destroyed by the constant pressure of being strong and and being outside unprotected wood ruin the wood and it would rot. That just an example little things kill the movie for me because it reminds you how face the whole story is!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Meant to write a review for Season 3, regarding the price.<br /><br />Season 1 is excellent!  If you enjoy the show, check out the Board, Gore and Swords podcast on iTunes or look them up on google.
B007ME5BUG|3.0|I learned a lot about the history of world war two. I always thought I had a good understanding of what happened during World War II, however this book showed me a lot of new things.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|Well I'm happy that its finally on blu-ray, but why is it not the original version of the story? Oh as an Old School Star Wars fan, this breaks my heart because I love the theater released versions that i grew up on, not this new crap! Like, why did they change the music in Jabba's lair?, and there were extra sand monsters walking around in the desert scenes- little stuff like that made me hate this set! So, as much as I would love to have the complete story in my collection, I refuse to get the prequel trilogy until this one gets right!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love this game makes my break time fly by glad y'all charge I don't want to lose my job
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|This is the second resident evil movie. It has it's moments where it gets kinda cheesy but at least it still follows the story of the game. Also it's not as creepy as the first movie, but it's ok on the scare meter.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Could not get enough and cannot wait to start the next book! A must read for anyone loving.  Most awesome
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Havent been able to open this movie or watch it yet but it was here in record time. Thank you!
B004UID2LC|1.0|It used to run smoothly and load,but since the last &quot;update&quot; it doesn't work at all!<br /><br />When I try to make it load it won't load!<br /><br />I loved it before the update but now it's just plain dead to me!
B00746O3X8|4.0|I am a hobby photographer who was in search of an alternative for carrying my Canon 7D with a 70-200 f2.8 lens.  The lens is heavy and for a few hours of photo work or hiking with the camera, it does create some discomfort.  I first saw the Cotton Carrier at my local photo shop and I thought that was the solution until I saw the price.  The Cotton Carrier is definitely the choice I'd make if I were a photo professional because the fastener quality, safety straps and the attachment to the vest are all very high quality.  Not that the Opteka was cheap, it just wasn't that &#34;professional&#34; level.  The Opteka fits me well because I am a fairly large person (5'10&#34; 190lbs), I would not purchase this item if I was slightly built.  It is comfortable and really distributes the weight nicely for the heavy lens.  I won't likely use the second holster as I rarely use a backup camera.  I did replace the retention straps with some heavier nylon straps and some small locking carabiners, my own desire for added security.  Overall I give this harness a great rating because it is a great value for the money!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I haven't been hooked by a book so quickly as this one, before. I think the books have a sort of electricity to them. Fantastic!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Truly an awesome movie. Each of the characters are true and authentic to the high school experience. I can't believe this movie wasn't nominated for any Academy Awards because it is a true masterpiece. it is a real look at trauma and the sadness it can cause someone. It goes beyond a group of high schoolers and takes you to a place where the audience can really identify with. The dialogue is sharp and crisp and will tear your heart out at the drop of a hat then have you laughing 2 seconds later.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This movie was a great story of redemption and an individual confronting his demons, but the technical side of the flight scene was over the top in technical mistakes. Without getting into the performance of this airplane or any other transport category airplane, what was portrayed in the movie just couldn't happen in real life. Trust me, I flew as an airline pilot for 29 years, and one of the airplanes that I flew as a first officer and captain was this model airplane (MD80) used in the movie. Still, the acting of the cast was superior, and for that alone worth the price of a ticket.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Anything by Guy Clark is great...this is even greater!. I live in Odessa and Monahans is 34 miles down the road...Green Frog Café is gone though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book!  Holds you in suspense all the way through.  I read The Lucky One and saw the movies Notebook and Walk to Remember.  I will now read more of Nicholas Sparks books. He is a new author to me because I tend to read mostly the same authors.  I rated the book 5 stars for a book I could not put down.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this. app keeps me up on the battery life on my kindle fire. and I like that I can custom my color
B00004XQP4|4.0|I like Green Day so I have been getting every album they come out with. If your into their music you will like this one.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I had difficulty getting into this book and felt much of it was repetitive and boring. It picked up in the last few chapters. Just really not my cup of tea.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting. Every time I die in the game I just cant stop playing.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Not too bad, good graphics and not to hard or too easy.  Only a few annoying ads but that's to be expected in a free game.
B000OY8NII|5.0|One of the (scifi) things that make this so original is that it's not set in the future, it's not about time travel (for the most part), and it's not about space (for the most part).It's about how the inventions of the worlds greatest minds can either go wrong be misused and how the main character has to deal with it.<br /><br />The comedy is hysterical, especially concerning the main character, and usually very fresh ideas.
1447231171|1.0|The entire Clifton Chronicles so far, has the sense of \\"have read this before\\" feeling. I guess there are only so many plots that you can have in life. Gold-digging brides, Brides who might be your sister, rivals from school, false accusations, share market plays, politics and elections, growing the business, artists and their canvasses.... I could place most of the events in the three books in his previous works. Hence the plot never thickens but just get overlaid by more and more \\"Oh yes.. This event happened in this book\\" layers.<br /><br />The only reason I read it and look forward to the next installment is because the language doesn't pall and I like Jeffrey Archer novels. But this is not enough to keep me going...
B00127RAJY|5.0|It's only 25 minutes and you feel like you've thoroughly worked out.  Buy it, do it and feel great. Thanks Jillian!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome story... Can't wait to start the next one! So many details,,, impossible nit to like it! Perfect book!! Loved!
3836538725|5.0|This is one of the greatest black and white photography books of all times... it's like looking at Ansel Adams images pumped with heavy steroids. Every serious image maker should own this book as it will become the standard by which we will judge high end black and white photos in the future. The composition in the shots is amazing, the lighting is stupendous, the mood in the shots is stellar. A definite must have.
1401216676|5.0|The quality is absolutely AMAZING. The cover looks great, the actual book with the sleeve taken off is beautiful. Now inside the book, I love the commentary before and at the end of the comic. The coloring is great, and of course the story is the greatest of all. Learning more about the Joker's past, (everything else that I'm not going to give away). I can read this over and over again and I love it every time. I HIGHLY recommend this for any batman fan. (or Joker fan HAHAHAahahahHAHAA)
1451626096|2.0|Philippa Gregory should be ashamed of herself for pawning this second rate piece of written excrement off on her fans.  I believe if anyone other than Philippa Gregory had presented this trash to a publisher for consideration they would have been told to find another career because writing definitely isn't their forte!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I feel like I made the right choice with this game I could have chosen several others but this game has me hooked.
030758836X|1.0|I know this is a hot book right now and if I have any true literary understanding I should love it but...I didn't.  I am an avid reader but it was a little too clever for me.  As a woman who understands how sometimes you just want to get back at a man who has wronged you, and who didn't blame Lorena Bobbitt, there were parts of the book I appreciated.  But I hated the ending and I hated the wife Amy.  I found her a sniveling spoiled brat.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Good action and entertaining story. Somewhat gory so maybe not for little ones but an entertaining fairytale for teens and adults.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It was AWESOME &amp; COOL I LOVED IT LOTS so I guss I half to keep writing so I REALLY liked it.
B008RV5K4U|3.0|Part 1 of this story basically just sets up the story for Part 2.  On its own, it's not really a decent movie and is just pretty average.  It didn't hold my full attention watching it.  [[ASIN:B00A2LFXVI Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2]], though, is where all the good stuff takes place, so I recommend watching both movies in one sitting.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I will be buying this to watch over and over with some copies of Joesph Campbell close by. Thank you Tom Hanks and crew.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|I read [[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]] by Frank Miller back in the 1980s when it originally came out as a four-issue, prestige format mini-series.  I didn't love it.  In fact, I had to force my way through it.  I purchased and watched the animated movie version of it, though, and found myself appreciating it much more.  While Part 1 of the movie is necessary because it sets up Part 2, Part 2 is really the more interesting and engaging DVD.  It features Superman, the Joker, and Catwoman.  Like the Batman, these three characters have aged and play different roles in society.  It's interesting to see where they've wound up.  The Joker is in prison but seemingly reformed; he's invited to a talk show for an interview.  Catwoman is overweight and runs a high-end escort service.  Batman has a new female Robin partner, Carrie Kelley, doesn't add much to the story other than shock value.<br /><br />The story is set in a bleak future.  The Cold War is looming.  The crimes in Gotham City bring Batman out of retirement to save the city one last time.  He runs into interference from Superman, who now works as the president's pawn.  The president looks and sounds very much like Ronald Reagan, and the story mocks him and his administration.<br /><br />The animation reminded me a lot of the comic's artwork in the series, and I think it worked really well for the movie.  Yes, Batman and Superman are grotesquely and unnaturally muscular, but it works for the feel of the movie and isn't distracting.<br /><br />Part 2 is far better than Part 1, but I recommend watching both in one sitting to get the full story.
B0045DO8LK|1.0|I was camping with some bros.<br />And this bro said that he was really into Pearl Jam.<br />Like it was a real thing to say.<br />To be taken seriously.<br /><br />I was like \\"What dude?\\"<br />No one really like Pearl Jam.<br /><br />But I guess people do.<br />And they think it's sophisticated to be a Pearl Jam fan.<br /><br />They put this album on and played it.<br />I listened to it.<br /><br />It was one of the worst things I've ever heard.  I actually couldn't believe how bland and plodding it sounded.<br />In a world of many wonders and wonderful music....why?  Why would anyone listen to Pearl Jam?<br /><br />What makes people like Pearl Jam?  Does it remind them of a time in their lives when they first found love?  Does it remind them of the sweet 90s?<br />If this album was done by another band with a different name would they like it?<br /><br />Why don't they still like Ugly Kid Joe?<br /><br />What is it about Pearl Jam that makes people like them?  Seriously?<br />It's not the music.  Is it The Ved's powerful voice?<br /><br />I'm not too sure, but it is fascinating that a band this horrible in every way from it's name to its sound can have so many fans.<br /><br />When someone say they like Pearl Jam I feel sorry for them.<br />It's too bad.<br /><br />But then I got to thinking...Maybe liking Pearl Jam is like being loyal to a sports team.  You root for your team.  I've been a New York Giants fan since I was born.  I'm loyal to them even when they are terrible.  Maybe it's something like that.<br /><br />Team Pearl Jam.<br /><br />The funny thing about Pearl Jam fans is that they all seem to be dudes.  Like Bro-Wave dudes.  Dudes who don't read.  Dudes with no style.<br /><br />And the thing is they don't even realize what Pearl Jam actually is...<br /><br />Listening to the over dramatic lyrics to the songs on this album was painful.  Backed by the bland music made for a horrible listening experience.<br /><br />I can figure out Pearl Jam.  They arethe worst product of American Music and a sad reflection of our rotting culture.<br /><br />Pearl Jam is for Simpletons.<br /><br />I feel bad for all the youngsters now who have to ride around in the back seats of cars while their dads or uncles play Pearl Jam.  They must be getting car sick.  Hating their fathers and uncles.  Wanting to vomit.  And hating music and life.  It's just wrong.<br /><br />If you are a wife of a Pearl Jam fan.  Have a talk with your husband and demand that he stop poisoning your children's ears.  I feel sorry for you.<br /><br />And youngsters reading this review.  Do yourself a huge favor...don't listen to Pearl Jam...don't do it.  You'll thank me.<br /><br />Below are some entry level albums that you should seek out instead:<br /><br />1.) Velvet Underground and Nico<br />2.) Piper at the Gates of Dawn<br />3.) Dolittle - The Pixies<br />4.) Master of Reality - Black Sabbath<br />5.) Slanted and Enchanted - Pavement<br />6.) You're Living All Over Me - Dinosaur Jr.<br />7.) Putrifiers II - Thee Oh Sees<br />8.) Ziggy Satardust - David Bowie<br />9.) Everybody Knows this is Nowhere - Neil Young<br />10.) Bee Thousand - Guided by Voices<br /><br />Just say no to Pearl Jam!!!!!!!!

B004RKXHZY|5.0|Stephanie Perkins did not disappoint with this follow up to Anna and the French Kiss. I could put this book down!
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Detail was really good. The plot moved along nicely.This story came close to staying true to the comic version from a few years back. If you are a fan of the Bat, you should pick this up for your collection. The bonus features were very good as well.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed this last book more than some of the others in the series, but that may have been because I knew it was the last.  I haven.t found another series that has just as satisfying a combination of character development, supernatural, story line and romance as the Sookie books.  I will miss Eric, Bill,Sookie  Amelia and Sam.
B009UZBLSG|1.0|I don't know what cable the 5/4/3 star people received, but it wasn't what I was sent! I plugged it in upon receiving this item, and it displayed beautifully. For that night. The next morning - and everyday since - I've gotten RED STATIC, green lines, and my TV sounds like it's in agony trying to re-connect every 5 seconds, always to a blank screen.<br /><br />What can I say that's positive... if you have the cable absolutely straight and taut, it just might output for you... and, as long as nobody in the room breathes, it can sometimes stay connected... but expect the battery to stop charging via micro-USB. I'm playing Bard's Tale hard mode w/no songs, and it seems to enjoy running my NN7 out of battery life in boss fights. Now I'm waiting for it to charge up, just to do it all over again.<br /><br />Stay away from this product. Another company have just released a similar cable (I'm not going to plug them, and they're not on Amazon) which I've just ordered, and I'm really, really hoping for a different outcome.<br /><br />I'll say it again: stay away from this product, unless you have the tolerance of a legendary zen master.... or if you're just a masochist whom likes wasting money on bad products so they can say the world sucks. Either way works. If you want something that's reliable, look somewhere else.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google's Chromecast:<br /><br />1. While the picture shows a nice, little self-contained device, you will need to plug it in via a USB cord to provide power. That should not be surprising, but I do wish it was more evident. It is in one of the promo pics, but that assumes you've got a USB port right by your HDMI port. Which I don't. One more cord in the mass isn't a problem until I move the TV.<br /><br />2. Setup was a breeze. I used an Android Tablet (Sony Experia Z) to do the setup.<br /><br />3. I was easily able to add \\"Casting\\" to my computer, which sits in the other room, and display tabs from Google's Chrome Browser on the screen. I'm not a fan of the fact that I then can't see what I'm doing with that tab on the screen in the room I'm in, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.<br /><br />4. As a side note on that, you may or may not be able to use Tab-casting to watch web-video on your TV. A few Internet video sites kicked back that \\"Chrome's Incognito Mode\\" is not compatible with their website, so it would not transfer. Netflix, Youtube are no problem. I couldn't use it to work around Hulu or ESPN, though.<br /><br />5. Netflix and Youtube streaming are great with this, though I'm mainly using Youtube. I've got a Netflix compatible device already setup, so I just use it. Youtube, though, is awesome with it.<br /><br />6. I would love to see Google and Amazon show a little more love and let this work with AIV streaming.<br /><br />7. I would also like to see this develop where I can screen cast my Android tablet, whatever I'm doing. I know there are some copyright issues there, but that would be a marvelous bonus.<br /><br />8. There is a very low power drain with this, so it's not been a problem leaving it plugged in.<br /><br />9. Tabcasting is a shade slower than app-based (Netflix, Youtube) casting. This is clear in the documentation.<br /><br />10. Trying to use a Chromecast revealed an issue I was not aware of: I cannot play through the Cast feature on Google Play Music the music I have bought elsewhere, like here at Amazon. Only native-purchased content can be played.<br /><br />For the low price, it's handy--easy to set up. I'll be taking mine with me for family travel, because we can use it to show Youtube clips on the big screen at family gatherings instead of everyone crowding 'round the tablet.

0345410025|5.0|I wasn't going to buy this book because its Kindle price of $11.99 violates my personal price ceiling of $9.99. I chanced it, though, and can say it's well worth the price. It's clear, thorough and a joy to read. There are suggestions for using memory aids to recall everything from the names of U.S. states to foreign words. Other books teach the same age-old methods but not in such a practical and lucid way. Recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is THEBESTBOOKEVER!!!!!! The book the critics( like me ) have been raving about. THIS STUFF WENT VIRAL!!!!!!!!! I own the movie and the book. The whole world is talking about this book about a futuristic country that is in the area that North America used to be. They rebelled, but the Capitol won. In payback, they pick one boy and one girl from the age of 12-18 from each of the 12 districts, in which each one makes, farms, or mines a general substance to sustain the country of Panem. These kids train, then fight to the death in an arena, which is filled with surprises and each year has some different habitat. Some take it as survival, and others group up or stay alone and mean to kill.Only one tribute can win. There is a big metal cornucopia with backpacks, survival packs, and weapons. At the beginning, it's called the bloodbath. The main characters lives in the outskirt district 12. She knows how to hunt and supported her mom and sister since her father died 5 years ago in a mine explosion since district  12  is the coal district. She volunteers for her 12 year old sister when she  gets picked. The other tribute is the baker's son. Will they become star-crossed lovers and both win? Find out in this book.-SD
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|A good investment for a right price. It is simple and easy to use. I bought it first time and returned it because of picture blinking. I bought an Elmo for 3 times more expensive and it was not a fit for my job because the camera was not rotating and the picture was again blinking. I returned Elmo too. However, I realized that either one of their driver software is not updated for window 8. So, I changed my new laptop computer's Window8 to Window7. I ordered the IPEVO Ziggi again and this time everything was working. Ziggi is Much better product for its price. It is a good investment.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|While I felt badly for Professor Aslan when I saw him being interviewed on FOX Network (truly an awful experience that came off like Muslim-bashing at its worst), my reading of his book on the \\"life and times of Jesus\\" was somewhat of a letdown. Aslan makes some good points, and is clearly knowledgeable about the time and geography of Roman-era Israel. But this book is not at all about the historic Jesus, but the -religious- person! And it is heavy speculation based on Scripture, for the very real reason being that (as Dr. Aslan stated) nearly all of the information about the Son Of Man came -after- his life on Earth! Hearsay evidence, often conflicting at that. From people who never met him.<br /><br />I had no problem with his pointing out that some tales of Biblical history (most famously the Herodean massacre of the innocents) were probably fabrications. And I liked his unsparing commentary about Pilate and Caiaphas (who really WERE as bad as pre-revisionist history had suggested). But page after page is speculation. We really may never know how John The Baptist met his end (if you do not believe the passages in the Bible). What about Jesus' kinship to David? And who can be sure that the interaction of Pilate and Jesus did not occur, as Dr. Aslan infers?<br /><br />It is a question of faith, and guesswork might produce some insight into the life of Jesus so long ago. But until there is hard, factual evidence to the contrary, I would ask that historians respect the \\"religious opinion\\" about The Messiah. All we have to go on is The Bible, as you will find out by reading \\"Zealot\\" with an open mind.<br /><br />Bottom line: buy this book, but understand its weaknesses and its occasional taunts at organized Christianity.

B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Game consistently crashes, it says the games are free and its true to some extent. You are allotted ten tokens at first and you use the tokens to play a game at two tokens each game. After that you either but them or you pay a scratch off game too warm more coins, the catch is that you only win from two to five tokens each scratch off. You aren't allowed to play the scratch off game for one hour intervals. There are also ads throughout the game as well.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This is the first reader I have used so can't compare to Google reader which no longer is available. I have really enjoyed using the Feedly app to organize what I want to read online. I actually save time because the most recent posts are listed for you in Feedly and I no longer have to go to each individual site from my favorites bar. My Feedly account was easy to set up and link to my desired sites. I use this app on my kindle fire and have had no problems installing it or using it after set up.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have 3 sets of Sony headphones - the ZX100, the V150 monitor series and now these.  There is not a huge difference between the ZX100 and the V150 - both are good.  I actually use the cheaper ZX100s more as they have a shorter cord that is easier to manage when going for a run.  Compared to those headphones, the MDR7506 professional series have a step up in clarity.  It is not huge, but it is noticeable.  As a very rough estimate (based on my iphone volume settings) they also have higher sensitivity.<br /><br />I rated these at 4 stars.  They are great headphones and I am really pleased that I purchased them.  However, I think the ZX100 and the V150 are such good value, that the price of these suffers by comparison.  For the price, I would like to see padding on the headband or perhaps a more comfortable fitment system (they don't quite fit my head perfectly).<br /><br />Overall, if you want a great set of enclosed headphones, you will be very happy with these.

0767919408|5.0|If you're already a fan of Bill Bryson's nonfiction, \\"One Summer, America, 1927\\" won't disappoint you -- even though you're already familiar with the historical record and some of the participants -- because of the breadth and depth of Bryson's research. There is also Bryson's unique way of compiling information, the entertaining way he brings it all alive and his extraordinary wit.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Bryson's style, expect writing that is bright and interesting, studded with irony as well as an emphasis on the comical foibles of human beings.<br /><br />\\"One Summer\\" may or may not be for the most scholarly professors of history, but it is certainly how I prefer to read history. I came away with an in-depth understanding of the climate of America in the 1920's, simultaneously occurring events, and connections between the players themselves.<br /><br />For instance, I've known about Charles Lindberg's famous transatlantic flight, yet I had never heard of the Orteig Prize. I've previously learned about Henry Ford and the Model T, but didn't know much about Ford, himself or that production of the Model T was completely shut down during the design and manufacture of the Model A. I've heard of baseball greats Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, but I'm now thoroughly familiar with their accomplishments, exploits and personalities. And that goes for a host of other personalities from this age, from the presidents to notorious anarchists, gangsters and murderers. I didn't know that the Federal Reserve made a mistake that precipitated the stock market crash. TV and radio came of age. The \\"Jazz Singer\\" was filmed. Borglum began to blast away at Mt. Rushmore this summer. President Coolidge chose not to run. The Mississippi River flooded as it never had before and Edna Ferber wrote the novel, \\"Show Boat.\\" There was more domestic terrorism in the summer of 1927 in America than there has been this summer of 2013. In the world of publishing, bigotry was losing its stronghold. Every paragraph held a revelation.<br /><br />One of my top ten favorite books, \\"A Short History Of Nearly Everything,\\" was written by Bill Bryson. Another favorite is, \\"A Walk In The Woods.\\" \\"One Summer, America, 1927,\\" is now added to my larger list of favorite books of all time.ghold.

B005FPT51K|1.0|My husband and I were really excited for this product and really wanted to make this work.  We loved that you could use your iPhones and iPads.  However, from the beginning we've had issues with glitches.  It constantly loses connection, stalls out, the sound stops working and the app will just freeze.  So annoying when you are trying to monitor your baby.  It will also lose connection in the middle of the night and sound an alarm that scares the crap out of you!  We are returning this for something that we can be a lot more confident in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever,try it today or you will never find out how awesome it is so play the game minion rush right now
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever buy it for every system or computer you have the price is great and not to expensive
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|The book is very well written. I simply couldn't put it down. The story is fantastic and gripping. I highly recommend reading it.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I Finally got this movie, I'm so happy right now! Glad to finally watch it at home with my family. 5 stars!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A great read and definitely worth the time and money. An awesome story and a great take on mystery of the world. Dark creatures and magic of the universe....'nuff said.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This app is nowhere near as  fun as everyone saw it is. You only have a certain amount of space to build things which sucks and not near as much content as the pc version that is the primary reason why I hate it it is a waste of 7 bucks you would be better off buying the pc version but that's just my opinion
0062255657|4.0|I know some of my friends did not care for this book particularly; several said it was derivative of some of King's writing. This may be true; I haven't read any King in years, so I'm not a good judge.<br /><br />I did quite like it.The plot was complex and somewhat harrowing, with a good balance between scary, comfortable, and wondrous. Most of the characters are fairly flatly drawn, which is appropriate here- both because they were seen by a young boy, and because that's in the nature of fairy tales. The boy- our protagonist- is drawn in great detail, however, and is not an \\"every-boy\\" but is uniquely himself, and is perhaps more flawed than most people would admi8t of their childish selves.<br /><br />Most interesting, though,is the way our narrator's memories and understanding of the events his child-self experienced ebb and flow. There are multiple levels of the truth, and none is 100% reliable. In that way it's more like real life than we tend to like to think, and also while reading somewhat like the almost-waking dreams one has when only half-asleep, where the differences between \\"real\\" and metaphor are hard to pin down and probably not important.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a challenging fun game makes you think and works on your remember skills mostly easy and very addicting
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Absolutely love this album. Todd La Torre sounds like Geoff Tate did on the first EP, The Warning and Rage for Order.  Back are the sweeping duel leads - at times it sounds like you are listening to one of those albums.  Michael Wilton finally gets to blow his cookies after being confined for over a decade.  Scott Rockenfield has his creativity on maximum, which some wicked stuff.  You can just feel the positive energy coming from this one.  This band has new life again.  I thought there might be some promise ahead for this band with the solid Mindcrime II album, but then they put out American Soldier (vibe was better but songs were bad) and the absolutely horrid Dedicated to Chaos.  I pretty much gave up on them, and sensed Geoff Tate was the problem, but didn't know for sure.  This seals my thoughts on that opinion.  (Regarding Tate - I thought some of the songs on his new solo record were some of the best material he's done in a long time, but some of the stuff played by the people he brought in to play on the record just doesn't fit the songs.  If he brought some of that stuff into Queensryche, some of those tunes could have been great.<br /><br />I can't wait to see these guys when they tour.  In my opinion, best album they have put out since probably Empire.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great and awesome game to play. I love it it's like alot of awesome  games.I love it thanks for it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|better instructions would be nice.  the ten levels I played were. fun and interesting, but I got frustrated at times.  I'm ready to take on more levels now.  feel like I just got started.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I don't know why Kelly Clarkson didn't sell as many of My December CD's. I love this CD (and Kelly Clarkson), so I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. But Kelly is a bit more loud in this one, almost acting like she's mad. Nut it's still great and I still love this CD. Thanks!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just received my Chromecast Media Player and I must say the setup was very easy. Just download the setup app and it walks you through the setup in less the 5 minutes. My wife and I played a video directly from a website and it streamed flawlessly, with no buffering. I thought a 24 minute video might have some issues, but to my delight, no issues were encountered at all.<br /><br />Google explains on their website that they plan to build onto the media player.  I look forward to being able to stream my own pictures and videos straight from my device. I realize there may already be other devices that allow you to do so, however, I like the portability of this device, not just for use within my home, but also when I travel to my mother in laws or any other family member. I look forward to seeing how Google builds on an already well thought out device.<br /><br />I did also like the very attractive and sturdy packaging chosen by Google. The device itself, although plastic, does not feel cheap. Actually, for its size, I thought it was hefty. The HDMI/USB extension included in the box connects to the dongle very snug.<br /><br />I would and already have recommended this to others. As it is, it works very well, and I am confident that Google will continue building on this first streaming dongle, and it will only get better.
B00AWKZSNM|3.0|I purchased this to backup vacation photos without a computer using an iPad and the camera connection kit. The iUSBPort App worked fine to view my attached drive, but the CloudMan App to upload to the attached drive needs a lot of work. It crashes often and would not allow me to upload more than a few photos at a time, and then would crash. I would have to reboot the device to start over as rebooting the App proved fruitless. It often was difficult to &#34;find&#34; the attached storage without making several attempts or reboots. Interestingly the GoodReader App works perfectly to upload to the the attached storage throught the iUSBPort device. The downside to that is you have to import your files from the iPad camera roll into the GoodReader App before you can pass them to the attached storage. This creates duplicate files on the iPad using up space. If you delete these from the GoodReader App to clear the space, the next time you run this work around you have same file names issues on your storage drive unless you made folders ahead of time when it was connected to a computer. If the GoodReader can make an App that works to upload smoothly, the manufacturer of the device should be able to do at least the same or better. Perhaps there are other Apps out there that could replace the CloudMan App, as it is poorly done and needs much improvement and better documentation than the lite guide included.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|My eight year old son was able to put this together almost completely by himself. It took some time to complete, but the end result was beautiful! I wish they had more sets in this series (and I wish a couple of them weren't ridiculously priced). We will be buying a couple more. It was worth it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had a bit of fun with this game and while some of the rooms were rather easy, still enjoyed playing.<br /><br />As of this writing I've completed the game (it took a few days of on-and-off play) and am waiting for new levels.  The one drawback is that the solutions were what I would call &#34;eventual&#34;.  Since there are limited options on what you can select and utilize, I found myself working through some of the puzzles using a process of elimination.  Granted, some of the codes (color sequences, for example) required clues as a brute force attack would have taken too long in my opinion.  But those clues were readily available from other tasks in the rooms.<br /><br />All in all I had some fun and may utilize this type of game/puzzle with my sons to help them develop their problem solving skills.
B00000IZOR|4.0|My granddaughter loves this phone. When she got this phone for her birthday she ran all over the house with the phone. I do not think it matters weather the pull cord is short or long, she tips the phone over all the time anyways because she is rough with the phone.<br /><br />The best part of the phone is she likes to talk to people on the phone and she does just that. This is an old school toy and does not relate to the new land lines or cell phones, but it still does the job.
B001PPLKI0|3.0|I was disappointed in this CD, it was not as I remembered, it could be me, therefore, I do not listen very often
0399255370|5.0|This book was stinking adorable.<br /><br />One day a little boy opens his crayon box to discover all of his crayons have run away. Instead they have left him notes, explaining why they have left.  Some feel under used, some feel over used--the orange and yellow crayon are in a fight over who is really the color of the sun.<br /><br />Its adorable and funny and will encourage kids to possibly color outside of the box or inside of the lines.<br /><br />It would be a lot of fun to read out loud to say Kindergarten aged kids and then have them do a coloring activity afterwards.<br /><br />I read this to myself in the giftshop of a museum and I'm sure I had a few people giving me odd looks for all of the chuckles that escaped me.<br /><br />The text is a bit long on each page, but the illustrations are very vivid and engaging.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I have this game and it is amazing. I watched the movie after I got the game. But on my kindle, it takes forever to load.

B007TVANDM|5.0|This book has a great meaning definitely would recommend! We love singing the song that goes along with the story!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  I've never seen a high school themed film that I could relate to as much as what is portrayed in this movie.  I went through high school at exactly the same time period as this movie so I felt a great sense of nostalgia while watching it.  Highly recommended.
B008M721MS|2.0|i am rather disappointed in the tablet verison of skype i have the kindle fire hd and at first it worked great with no issues save doing video calls is often choppy but thats probably more hardware then soft ware maybe combo of both my issue is it keeps crashing with a error that forces me to remove it from device and reinstall i have literally had to reinstall it 10 times in one day further it seems to lag quite a bit if ive been having multiple conversations try to switching between contacts<br /> so i give it a two star rating it needs some major work further doing video often crashes it or takes forever to load freezing up my kindle

0143122843|3.0|While Philip Kerr is an accomplished writer, and I am looking forward to reading more of him, for me planting his detective, Bernie Gunther in a Reinhold Heydrich house party in occupied Czechoslovakia raised the same issues as occurred in the 1997 movie, Life is Beautiful.  Concentration camps aren't funny.  Nazi bestiality is not entertaining.  There were parts of this book that caused me to lose sleep, especially as I plowed through the most savage section.  Additionally,  it strains credulity to think that Bernie could get away with his irrepressible sardonic personality complete with continuous sarcastic comment in the face of paranoid sadists like Heydrich and his henchmen. He should have been cashiered and executed--by Nazi standards.  I couldn't accept it.  Mel Brooks understood this.  You can't go further with Hitler and the Nazis than to make a farcical joke of them, not to jibe with them in person.<br /><br />However,  the book is cleverly written,  and Kerr handles the recasting of the Agatha Christie story that the plot is based upon well.  Bernie is an interesting character in the Raymond Chandler mold. Another difficulty is that Kerr needed to have Bernie dump acid comments on the Nazis every page and a half or so.  This got tiresome.  Nevertheless I liked him.  He was human in spite of his not too well detailed personal flaws.  I liked and felt for his love interest, Arianne,  the Prague Femme Fatale.  The Nazis on the other hand were rather pallid.  One looked like another,  probably because you can't do too much to humanize such an inhuman group of monsters.  Even Heydrich did not come across too vividly.<br /><br />The incorporated history lesson was perhaps the best part of the book.  I had heard about Heydrich and his assassination,  but knew little detail about the occupation of Czechoslovakia.  Kerr incorporated that into the detective story very deftly.<br /><br />On balance,  I would give the historical treatise five stars,  but found the conceit of transporting Philip Marlowe to Nazi occupied Prague too jarring for my taste.nceit of transporting Philip Marlowe to Nazi occupied Prague too jarring for my taste.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I have somewhat of a minor addiction to the Vox Amplug - I have the AC30, Twin, Satriani, and Classic Rock.  And, really, since they're surprisingly cheap and allow me to play at times and places I never could before, they're arguably a better investment than most guitar equipment.<br /><br />I had read good reviews of the \\"Metal\\" for awhile, but not really being a huge fan of metal rock, I passed on it.  Having tested it out, however, you could make an argument that if you could only own two of these, the Metal should be the 2nd one.  (FYI, the other would be the AC30 or Twin, which covers the completely clean-to-overdrive range).<br /><br />A few things you should know about the \\"Metal\\" Amplug: first, it is an \\"always-on\\" distortion.  There's really no cleaning it up with the volume knob, but that isn't really the point.  It's meant to be played loud and hard, even if it is a bit of a one-trick pony.  Also, I've heard it impersonates a \\"Mesa Boogie\\" type of amplifier, but I haven't played one, so I can't say.  It has plenty of volume on tap, and you can hit power chords and leads with nice depth and saturation.  It's extremely satisfying to hit a big chord and hear such a gigantic sound coming out of a plastic headphone amplifier.  You don't even need top-notch headphones to enjoy it - I use a pair of $20 Sony's and love it.<br /><br />Some people might be skeptical because \\"Vox\\" is not generally associated with \\"metal\\" guitar, but don't let that dissuade you.  These fully-analog headphone amps are outstanding, and each is unique in its own way.  This just happens to be one of the best.
B008602KQI|5.0|The twist and turns in the suspense keeps viewers thinking and trying to predict whats next. Interaction of viewers discussing who will be the next to go is almost like a contest among viewers as to will be right!
0307476073|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />  This was an interesting book told by an irritating narrator. If you wanted a book on what not to do a trip like this one, this would be the perfect guide. She makes no thoughful preparation. She buys the wrong boots, too much equipment and doesn't bother to check the weather report of where she's hiking. She is the epitome of a clueless hiker. You read about them all the time. People that go ill-prepared into the wilderness and then must be rescued at a heavy cost. Her backpack is so heavy that she must do the oddest gyrations to get it on.<br /><br />  I  am sorry that her mother died painfully of cancer too soon but it doesn't give you a free pass to behave badly. She doesn't take responsibility for her own actions either that include shooting heroin and sleeping with multiples of men even though she's married. She blames her fammily who don't react to her mother's death the way she thinks they should. At the first chance she gets on the trail, she is offered opium and accepts. She spits it out but you wonder if she's really learned anything on her life on the trail.<br /><br />  There is some good things in the book. The hike along the Pacific Coast Trail is breath taking. The people she meets on the trail are wonderful. One throws things out of her backpack to make it manageable. Another feels her in on the snow on the trail since she didn't bother to check. One tells her how to get boots that fit. On and on, the acts of kindness makes this worthwhile. It's too bad it didn't have a wonderful protagonist.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|A Tom Cruise vehicle and not much more.  The cgi is good but the story is thin at best.  Independence Day redux and not very well redux.  Even the clone angle was apparent early on.  I'd title this vid \\"Obvious\\" instead of Oblivion.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Another solid hit by Lee Child. I enjoyed every one so far and plan  to continue reading every Reacher book
B005LAII8A|4.0|Not bad.  There's a story. It's engaging.  The end wasn't obvious, to me at least. Interesting twist on time travel. A satisfying vid.
0740797719|5.0|Very well organized and detailed.  Excellent for appreciation of how many forms of light that can be used when painting.
144476490X|5.0|This is the children's version of A Street Cat Named Bob. I bought a copy and read it even though I had read the \\"adult\\" book. I would recommend it to anyone's children (and to adults too!).

B0089XH38M|5.0|As with all of the AVG products I have used this is a great product.  It is worth the time to download and install and updates are easy.
1594746036|2.0|First off, this book is a decent young adults novel and I would recommend it to most teenagers. However, adults who read a good deal, or anyone who is familiar with fantasy and adventure elements will find this lacking. Since I am in the latter category, that's how I chose to star the book. Some of this is because the book itself is a bit mis-marketed. It is not a gothic novel or particularly creepy except for a moment or two in the entire novel, its more of a fantasy/adventure along the lines of Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, etc.. So if you're looking for a creepy or moderately scary novel, you won't find it here. Secondly, the characters are flat. The only character that you get to know in any depth is Jacob himself and he is kinda unpleasant, everyone else is either one-dimensional or less then a dimension (yes, it is possible). For example, the love interest is a beautiful girl with a fiery personality who conveniently forgets her former sweetheart who she had supposedly loved for decades, in order to be with the main character. Hard to believe especially since there is not even a halfway decent explanation for it. Writing is solid but doesn't stand out in any way, although the pictures are there to make things more interesting. Maybe what is worst of all is that it is clearly being set up to be a series, which means that this book does not give a conclusion that is satisfying in and of itself, you are expected to purchase more. For some people, none of these are hardships, but for me, all of the above combined ended up being a deal breaker and I won't be seeking out the sequels.
630587493X|5.0|A salute to Asimov, author of the novel on which this film was based. A salute to all who put together this perfect film; and a salute to all who watch it and believe in an Idea, (if, even for a moment,) that the whole might be greater than the sum.
B006QF7664|4.0|This is a chilling tale of the space mission Apollo 18 (with Lunar Landing Craft Freedom) on the south pole of the moon.  The movie provides steady drama viewed from many angles and different types of film, which makes it look like real footage.  The plot is exciting and the movie makes you feel like you are watching it live.<br /><br />Two of three astronauts from the Apollo mission go to the moon and find an unexpected cosmonaut (Russian) landing and something else as they explore the area.  Finding one of the cosmonaut pilots dead, they become consumed with trying to find answers.  When they do, things start to go wrong fast and they race against time to leave the moon.<br /><br />I found the movie worth watching.  Even though I know the story is fictional, the movie did a great job in making you believe it was real.  I didn't think it had a lot of replay value but it certainly was entertaining nonetheless.
1781162646|5.0|I must admit I didn't expect much from this book. While a film noir fan and a long time King reader, I figured this book would be a lightweight. I'm happy to admit when I am wrong. Captivated from the first page, I cared about these characters which had not happened for me in a long while with King's works. Events flowed as they unfolded and kept me guessing and involved. What a good ride! Definitely recommend it for an enjoyable read.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Had I given into the pressure to buy it before Christmas and spent over $100 then I would have been sorely disappointed. But for $34.99 - we got exactly what we wanted. It's a lot of bricks.. it's name brand.. it's Minecraft (which let's face it adds some bucks to the price) and the creeper is really cute.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Left me on a cliffhanger. The development of the steamy, messed up relationship between Eva and Gideon is disturbingly and painfully romantic.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. It might be a minority opinion, but I like this film just as much as the original Evil Dead. Today, horror films are not exactly what they used to be. This generation tends to believe in gore more than scares. Don't get me wrong; I like gore. While I like films like Saw and Hostel; I also want some scares. Those films are mostly just gore. The new Evil Dead does indeed have its fair share of gore, but there are also many scares. I found myself jumping more than a little bit. It is a bloody and jumpy good time. It is without a doubt a treat for horror fans!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I think I had read. Adventure, comedy, tragedy, suspense and romance. So many twist and turns, excitement on every page. Love it!

B000L53D4O|4.0|I think I bought ours when Amazon was having the Fisher Price sale for around $12.  My son loves it and I'm interested to see if it will be sturdy enough to hold up to him once he actually starts using it as a walker.  It would be nice if there were some kind of locking mechanism on the wheels but we usually prop it against a wall so he can use it without it rolling away.  For the price, this was a great purchase and keeps our son interested!

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it first came out and kept thinking about it over the months, finally deciding to buy the DVD so I can enjoy it again and again.  It has several elements that appeal:  travel to India; experiencing another culture; finding alternative ways to spend ones' &#34;golden years&#34;; interesting characters that, mostly, love life and adventure.  Changes in some of them are quite nice and the young Indian man who owns the hotel where they stay is the delight that keeps you smiling.  Live life!!

0385523912|5.0|For fifteen of perhaps the worst years of the Kim Jung Il's Democratic Republic of North Korea (DPRK), this book tracks the lives of six ordinary citizens as they literally struggled to stay alive. And then, as a last resort to starvation, they all had no choice but to defect to South Korea. Here in a series of wide-ranging emotionally charged interviews that take us well beyond the infamous prison &#34;Camp 14&#34; into a wider landscape difficult for an outsider to imagine, the author brings abruptly to life the meaning of the term modern dystopia. This recounting of the lives of these six defectors from 1994 to 1999, constitutes a parade of unimaginable horrors.<br /><br />Here we learn what happens in one of the world's most rigid totalitarian states when a famine kills millions, when state sponsored businesses fail, when salaries cease being paid in currency, are then paid in food stamps until even food stamps run out; when the medical care system, power grid and even the sewer systems all fail and there is no heating fuel in the dead of winter.<br /><br />We see how these six people got tired of listening to lies told through an ideology of a cult of personality, as well as how they got tired of waiting for hope and change to happen; where indifference and embracing idleness became an important ally and an acquired survival skill; where office crews were sent into the streets daily as a part of their duties to scrounge the streets for food.<br /><br />When Dr. Kim, a thirty something female medical doctor crossed the border into China and came upon a bowl of rice and meat sitting on the ground for a dog, she had never seen such a big bowl of rice or such a fine piece of meat. She exclaimed to the Dog's owners, who took her in, that Chinese dogs eat better than North Korean doctors.<br /><br />We learn that when the people stop believing all of the lies that the state tells them, nothing is left but corruption, jack-booted police and the military, and tyranny:Everything that is needed for survival requires a bribe, and anything taken without one lead directly to jail without passing &#34;go.&#34; However, at least during 1994-1999, there was little difference between being inside or outside a jail in the DPKR.<br /><br />We discover what happens in a nation when the slogans, flag-waving, huge pictures on all walls and in all plazas of &#34;our dear leader,&#34; goose-stepping soldiers, and the set speeches of &#34;our great leader,&#34; all turn to dust: The legitimacy of the state and the culture of the country are all called into question and then quickly made a mockery of, and the people then lose faith. When this happens they take matters into their own hands. In the DPRK, taking matters into your own hands meant defecting. Five stars

B008JFUO4U|4.0|Sure its a bit of a mashup of post-apocalyptic earth sci-fi type movies, but they put it together so well.  The love story, music, sound effects and visuals are just right. I was fortunate enough to enjoy this on a 7.1 setup & 65\\" plasma and it was pretty compelling.  I think sci-fi fans will really enjoy and appreciate the movie.<br /><br />However, as many mentioned for an alien tech that conquered all of humanity, how it could not determine Jack's intentions at the end, a being it created, was a bit off.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app so much .It is so challenging and it is so fun .I love how it has the colorful emojis.
B009AMANBA|4.0|History buffs will love this movie as it seems very true to the period. It has a nice tight story line - not a lot of unnecessary jumping around or irrelevant side trails, but still provides good detail about various aspects of Lincoln's life. Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones were fantastic, very well cast. It was not riveting for me - I walked away a few times to do other things - but when I was away from the screen I heard that I had missed important or funny scenes. A good movie if you are of the temperament or in the situation to just sit and take it in.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|It was great to the end but I can not get it to end. I would like to  play again. How do you get it to start from the start.<br /><br />Shirleysiler
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is exactly what we needed; an affordable way to easily access internet apps and, most importantly, google music and videos!  You can read the description for the details but I will at least say this much; it works great and streams very quickly.  The price can't be beat for $35 either.  Google is a smart company and knows what they're doing and they totally reinvented the wheel with this one.  It's no longer important to have expensive access to internet apps and Google is bringing it to us at (finally) an affordable price.<br /><br />It's as small as it looks and so easily hides behind your TV in one of your HDMI ports.  There is a light that I can see from the side when all the living room lights are turned off, even when the TV is turned off because (as of 2013) it does require a power source which can be as easy as a micro usb cable to the USB port on your TV or to a plug-in into the wall.<br /><br />Great purchase and I can't wait to see where this small step leads the industry!

074356619X|5.0|My sister loves to listen to this motivational CD. I think is good to be reminded about the good things in life and how you can make it good especially when driving at traffic hours. Use it/buy it if you would like some tips and relaxation at the same time.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Wow! I'm okay with movies that stray from the book a little bit... but I only like this if they change it in a way that makes it better or equally good. This did not do that. It pretty much wasn't even the same story. It had the same premise, same setting, same characters (other than a few that got cut), but anything after that it was completely changed. It shouldn't even be allowed to be called Beautiful Creatures anymore.<br /><br />On its own, I didn't even think it was a good movie. There were multiple times where I lost interest and wanted the movie to end, but forced myself to continue watching just in case in got better. It didn't. It didn't make any sense, and many of the characters weren't built enough for me to particularly care about them. The only ones I liked were Ethan and Jeremy Irons. I loved how awkward and real they made Ethan be... That laugh is amazing.<br /><br />Overall I'd suggest renting it rather than buying it. Most people I know either love it or hate it.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED Talks, I listen. The app works very well. I love the these talks and it makes it easy to find something new or something I've seen and want to share. Loads quickly, looks great!

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm pretty stingy with my stars, but this app is absolutely the best keyboard app out there. The predictive typing is just so good! I find myself wishing I had SwiftKey on my work computer keyboard. And the recent addition of Flow makes it all the sweeter. I used to be a fan of Swype, but SwiftKey just outdoes it. This is the only app I ever gave 5 stars to!
1781162646|5.0|This book did not disappoint.  Pulp fiction at it's best. The story grabs you and takes you along for a great ride. Please be sure that the bar is all the way down and in it's locked position. Nice twist.
B000U0O9FM|2.0|The movie is not about a bunch of guys fighting.  It is about independance from fear.  The movie is EXCELLENT.  The book is chaotic and quite unclear, and if I had not seen the movie first, I would never have understood the book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Deeply personal stories with some intense character development.  There is something to relate to in each one.  I think of this book as a collection of stories held together by the circumstance and/or bloodlines of characters. Kabul is the only constant, but not all the stories take place there. It is not a novel with a continuous plot.  I loved the rich character development, the intense consequence of their actions, or lack thereof and my own resulting introspection.  I'm going to read it again.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome. great idea having an ability to increase coins after a certain distance. also the abillities to buy make want to keep on playing!

1616550414|5.0|This is an interesting read, both for avid gamers as well as folks who have maybe played the NES or SNES Zelda games. This would be a good purchase to put on your coffee table.
B00821PCJS|1.0|Visually OK and good pilot but after episode 2 or 3 it goes down the toilet (I finished the season as an act of discipline... maybe masochism). Quite predictable plot, with logic gaps and huge verisimilitude problems. Aliens that are quite not intelligent or effective, a 'resistance' that acts not as a guerrilla but as an army of dummies and yet the aliens are not able to erase them. Long pointless and repetitive dialogues that do not go anywhere.  I found myself forwarding entire parts of several episodes... At the end I have to say this a despicable piece of s...t.  Season two apparently is even worse...
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I loved watching the ins-and-outs of how the musicians make music. The sound of the drums... making stuff up as they go... for a fan of rock music this was a great little inside look, with a bit of history included. How can you beat interviews with legends like Neil Young, Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, and the rest of them? Plus, I love Foo, and Nirvana, soooo... this was well worth the time I spent watching.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Great resource, so glad I got a copy of this book as well as the audio CDs, I play in my car everyday. Life changing

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|`He's not dangerous.'<br />Writer/director Jeff Nichols presents a film with many levels of meaning and entertainment. It is at once a thriller of sorts, a mystery, a love song that manages to touch every character in the drama, a character study of a lovesick criminal on the run and a coming age story for a 14 year old boy discovering all the permutations of love and belonging and family and needs. It is a remarkable stage for the talents of Matthew McConaughey and Tye Sheridan and will likely place them in the Oscars race.<br /><br />The best synopsis of the film has been summarized by Roadside Attractions and is referenced here: `14 year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives on a makeshift houseboat on the banks of a river in Arkansas with his parents, Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and Senior (Ray McKinnon). He sneaks out early one morning to meet his best friend, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Neckbone, also 14, lives with his uncle, Galen (Michael Shannon), who makes a hardscrabble living diving for oysters. The two boys set out to an island on the Mississippi River, where Neckbone has discovered an unusual sight-a boat, suspended high in the trees, a remnant of an extreme flood some time in the past. They climb the tree and into the boat only to find fresh bread and fresh footprints. Realizing that they are not the only ones who have discovered the treehouse boat, they decide to leave. When they reach the shore, they find the same footprint in their boat. And that's when they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a gritty, superstitious character; his clothes are dirty, his tooth is cracked, and he needs help. He tells the boys he will give them the treehouse boat, his current hideout, in exchange for food. Neckbone is reluctant, but Ellis brings food to Mud, and they develop a tentative friendship. Ellis learns that Mud has killed a man in Texas, and police and bounty hunters are looking for him, but Mud is more concerned about reuniting with his longtime love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, who has recently developed his own crush, agrees to help Mud escape with Juniper. Ellis and Neckbone carry out bold schemes in an effort to protect Mud and relay messages to Juniper, who is holed up in a fleabag motel, under constant surveillance by Carver (Paul Sparks), a Texas bounty hunter. Carver and his gang are intent on capturing Mud, on orders from the cold-blooded King (Joe Don Baker). As the boys risk everything to reunite these seeming mythical lovers, Ellis's own ideas about love and romance are challenged by the strains in the relationships closest to him: his parents' marriage is dissolving while he himself falters in his efforts to impress May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Through it all, Ellis struggles to look for an example of love that he can believe in, learning about the unspoken rules and risks of love and the reality of heartbreak.'<br /><br />As important and impressive as the story is the overwhelming aspects of the film are the moments when the concept and meaning of love is shared  - many times, by many people, in many ways.  It is insightful and deeply moving. This is a film that proves that a fine entertainment visually can also be a great cerebral fix! Grady Harp, August 13e Witherspoon).

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Usually I carry my Kindle Fire with me to appointments for reading while taking up space in a waiting room, however, there are times when I am surprised with unplanned time waiting time (waiting for family members to finish shopping, etc.).  Those are the times that I really enjoy the Kindle App.  Several people have asked me how I get a Kindle book to open on my cell phone.  They are totally unaware of the Kindle App.  It is one of the best kept secrets by Amazon Kindle.  I think Amazon should do more open advertising of this hidden feature.

B002NUULNG|4.0|I found it a little awkward trying to get to the original rleases but it's in there.  the new stuff is a little weird but i would still recommend true fans to atleast give it a watch once,  IMO the 3d was unnecessary but it wont destroy the experience.  wont recommend folks who never seen it before to start off with 2.0 as the 3d is hit or miss, mostly miss, stict with the original in that case.
0307744434|4.0|The Night Circus was an enchanting read that kept me entertained and engaged throughout the entire book. Morgenstern weaves a brilliant story where magic meets mystery with a twist of love. I'd recommend reading this in large chunks to avoid getting overwhelmed by the long list of characters, complex story, and broad timeline. But don't be intimidated; it's well worth the read.

0380715430|4.0|My first experience with Bill Bryson explaining the seemingly mundane was [[ASIN:0767919394 At Home: A Short History of Private Life]], which I found informative, fast-paced, and hilarious. I'm currently in the process of going through his backlist and have recently finished \\"The Mother Tongue\\". While it's not nearly as well-done as \\"At Home\\", it's still entertaining.<br /><br />Bryson has set the challenge of describing not only what makes English unique as a language, but also how it came to be one of the most-spoken languages on the planet. Beginning with the Romans, he goes through the rise of the Anglo-Saxons, the Norman Conquest, and the spread of English from Britain to America and beyond. He also compares English to other languages, not only in his chapter on swearing (which seems to be very critically reviewed on this site), but also his delightful sojurn into word games such as palindromes and crossword puzzles. Along the way, he meanders through the invention of last names, pronunciation, spelling, and the divergence of English into its two main dialects: British and American.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest drawback to the book is the fact that it was published over twenty years ago. Ordinarily, this would not be a problem, but with a book on language - which is changing constantly - it seems quite dated. I'd love to see an update with a section on the rise of the internet and the vocabulary that has been developed to describe technology, and it is perhaps this gaping hole (which, considering the book was published in 1990, wasn't a glaring omission at the time) that makes the rest not flow quite as well. Many of the \\"common phrases\\" in the book are quite dated, as slang and even common use has moved on in the last two decades. Overall, it's a delightful read, but not nearly the best from Bill Bryson.
B008YW5RH2|2.0|This game I thought would possibly b fun but I when I play it the character would not run for the ball the other person would serve and my person wouldn't hit wen I swipe my finger. I did not like this game at all.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I bought this along with my Legend about 4 months ago.  Previously I owned a Voyager Pro.<br /><br />It is one of the most useful pieces of technology I have owned, because of its convenience and functionality.<br /><br />In brief:<br />1.  It is a hard shell case for an earpiece that needs one.<br />2.  It charges your headset.<br /><br />Convenience:<br />Previously, I plugged in my headset every day or two.  If I didn't, I had a dead headset when I needed a working one.  With this, you don't think about charging your headset.  You put it in the case, and it is always charged.  It is always in a bag or pocket, ready for use.  About once a week, I plug in the case in a pocket of my Powerbag (where I usually keep it).  An hour later it is charged.<br /><br />Summary:<br />If you are getting a quality headset like the Legend, get the case. There may be one other headset on the market that has a similar charging solution, but in the end I went with the reliability and quality of Plantronics, and have not regretted it.

0226264211|4.0|I was drawn to Friedman's book after having read several of Thomas Sowell's books (brilliant) and Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom (really brilliant).  I've also seen some great videos of Friedman on YouTube from his Free to Choose lectures, where he is speaking on economics and dismantling audience members' arguments.  He seemed to be an engaging, witty and very personable speaker.<br /><br />I found that stretches of this book were kind of dry and hard to read.  I'm not sure if it was due to Friedman's writing style, or if it is because most non-fiction books today use simpler techniques in order to cater to a mass audience, which may not be as well-versed in economics as previous generations.  This book was written in 1962, so some of the examples are out of date, but the overall concepts are still relevant.<br /><br />Friedman unabashedly defends free-market capitalism, and explains why individualistic freedom trumps central planning on a number of issues.  He is an important voice for libertarianism and classical economics, along with Hayek and Sowell, and Capitalism and Freedom is a must read for anyone who subscribes to these theories.<br /><br />Here is a blurb:<br /><br />\\"The great achievement of capitalism has not been the accumulation of property, it has been the opportunities it has offered to men and women to extend and develop and improve their capacities.  Yet the enemies of capitalism are fond of castigating it as materialist, and its friends all too often apologize for capitalism's materialism as a necessary cost of progress.\\" (p. 169).

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very disappointed in this. Amazon just emailed me that I can expect delivery at the end of October for this order which was placed in July. Ridiculous. I can see Google underestimating the demand for this product, but a 3 month wait???? No thanks.<br /><br />Someone else will come up with something better in that time-frame now that the ice has been broken... Google is certainly going to lose their momentum (and their market advantage) with this kind of delivery schedule.<br /><br />Why is Google so hell-bent on sabotaging itself? The Revue, Google TV, now Chromecast, and I'm sure there were a couple of other \\"mistakes\\" in there as well... seems the \\"Peter Principle\\" can apply to big corporations as easily as it applies to individuals.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I had it on my brothers IPod and someone stoll his ipod so im happy to have this game again. Addicted! You should so totally get it!
0064471837|5.0|Nix crafted a world that I have yet to find one to compare it to, it's unique ideas are unsurpassable. I still ponder the idea of a necromancer with such a good purpose. The strong female lead gave me strength as a struggling teenager who needed to escape the world I was living in. I years later love to recall the fascinating plot and details and get lost in the world once again while discussing them with my husband who also read and loved them as a teenager before we met! Nix and his novel Sabriel were and always will be definitely highly regarded among my friends and me!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Folks are looking for more apps which will come . Besides Neflix there is YouTube , Chrome and Google Play which is significant if you like Google products.  The HDMI extender is quite important if your WiFi setup is marginal .  By adding it  my setup went from 1 to 3 bars.  My router is on the floor above.<br /><br />The setup was straight forward and for $ 35 there is nothing in its class.  I was fortunate to get the free 3 month offer from Netflix also.  Chromecast's  multi platform capability is impressive and the future looks bright .
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I thought this book would suck because it was for summer reading, but it ended up being such a wonderful book full of exciting conflict, and feel good, happy resolutions! When I finished this book and closed it up there was a huge smile on my face!! Such an awesome read!!
B004L0NGEC|4.0|I really like the fact that this app les me not only store my photos online but easily share them on blogspot.com. I can't get most Google apps on my Kindle Fire for some reason. I have the full Picasa on my Windows pc and it is annoying not to be able to use the full app on my Kindle Fire.
0316017930|5.0|What a wonderfully insightful book! I'm not a big reader, but I loved reading this one. I would suggest every parent and all teachers to read this.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Not the type of book I would normally reading but this one has got me wanting to read more like this. There were many unexpected twists that were expertly woven to keep me reading and reading.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I had to remove this app because it wouldn't allow my Kindle to time out. One of the requirements was to disable timeout. I didn't like only having 5 lives without having to connect to Facebook.  But I loved the concept of the game and I still have it on my phone. The update on my IPhone made it all better. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars.
B000002HEM|5.0|loved MTV unplugged...<br /> this doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />this is so stupid...Amazon is the word count police...what the H---why ask for my opinion and then tell me how much I must say about it ...right!
0743201140|1.0|I purchased this book new, access code was sealed inside book, access code does not work.  I tried entering code several times.  Was unable to return it even though it was sold to me as a new book.  Very disappointed, bought at beginning of school and did not open book and try access code until needed for class.
0762449306|5.0|Who wouldn't love this thing!! Great little TARDIS to keep me company until I get picked up by the real one.
B002ASY6Q4|4.0|I am just getting into this book.  Very few writers can take as many characters as Ken Follett does in his writings and blend them into varied situations and then bring them all together.  He can fill each page with suspense but still make his books easy to read.  He can, with clarity, reveal the feelings of all levels of society as they tread through a maze of challenging situations.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Was on the fence with this band....liking the few songs played on Sirius Octane...their cover of Bad Company was an attractant...but when I heard them interviewed on the same station, heard some more songs, and listened to the banter,  something clicked so I used a coupon for Amazon and downloaded this album.<br /><br />Listened to it for two days straight. Refurbished my deck, tore thru some landscaping and worked out till I dropped, literally, had noting left. The music drove me, and drove me...<br /><br />I've heard their live performances can be sketchy, but hope to see them on their next go round in the NYC area.<br /><br />Get this album, and get to work!<br /><br />PS - the cover of Momma Said was a real nice sonic surprise...removing all the silliness and throttlng up the beat and missing guitars of the original. Kudos FFDP! This is what a cover is supposed to be, different and a little hard to recognize.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|kind of confusing as to what to do in some situations. has pretty decent graphics for a free game. do not like how a lot of the missions revolve around purchasing certain objects and of course you can earn the points to get them...but really they want you to spend actual money to buy them.
B008AVXGA2|5.0|Looking for a new kind of fairy-tale? One more in keeping with Grimm than Disney, but with the same happy ending we all love?  This is a very cute book about a Russian fairy tale, where two youngsters discover something magical, in somewhere very special, where they find enchantment of all kinds.  =)  You won't be disappointed!
B000GV8OY2|5.0|The musical numbers were great.  The sets were totally authentic....you really believe you are looking at early 20th century St. Louis. Marjorie Main and Judy Garland stole the show.....&#34;Tootie&#34; was annoying.  Except for her character, the film was a delight.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|I am happy with this purchase. This would truly be a life-saver in a survival scenario. This is a decent multitool, good flashlight and firesteel.
B000ENC5YW|3.0|The movie is entertaining, Connery is distinguished and Zeta-Jones is irresistible. I would like there to have been one minute, just one minute that was in the least believable. But for that matter Star Trek is not believable either and I still like it. My only real complaint is that my VHS tape had no less than eight previews and that is typical of the contempt that Hollywood has for the general public. But if you don't expect perfection you should like the feature movie enough.
0307200477|5.0|i ordered this specifically for the larger size since the local stores only carried the original smaller size.  my son simply loves this book.  he learned to pat the bunny immediately as well as touch the other pages.  he does tend to dig his nails into the page with \\"daddy's beard\\" though, but no complaint for that.  i just wish the corners of the book were rounded, so it is safer for him to turn the pages himself.  since they are super sharp, i only let him read it when i am turning the pages.  also, the plastic comb binding in the middle is a little annoying and can be easily destroyed by little hands.  but overall, a great book, your younger baby/toddler will need to be supervised to read it though.
0345529057|5.0|Was a gift for my husband. He wanted to read more about story line and characters after watching HBO mini series
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I love this knife, I want to buy a couple more just so I can have one in each truck!! it is everything it says it is!!
B000000OU0|5.0|I loved The Eagles at a teenager in the 70's.  When the concert came to town we bought tickets and it is by far the best concert I have ever been to.  The DVD is something you HAVE to buy too. You won't be sorry if you like the Eagles.
1565234243|5.0|I found this book really helpful with my carving and I think if anyone wants to take carving serious then this book is always good to have in ones library
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I can play it just about anywhere. it keeps me entertained! I love taking care of my horse! thanks!
B0018STVHQ|1.0|First off, I'm going to say that I am a huge Eric Bana fan (hello, Munich?!). I also have enjoyed most of Natalie Portman's films. Now that the niceties are over- this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. And by far the worst \\"historical\\" movie I've seen, ever. Period. Almost no part of this film was accurate. Henry raping Anne? Are you serious? Mary storming through the palace after Anne's death to claim the baby Elizabeth? Again, really? This film is a wayward attempt at feminism. Sure, we can pretend that Mary was a jilted lover, we can pretend that Anne was raped and then conceived her daughter. But why lie? Why portray Mary as such a heroine ( she had limited involvement with the king outside his bedchamber), and Anne as such a deviant (she being the one who kept her legs close for YEARS before they were married). Why flip this story into something it never was, and honestly far less interesting? Also, the costumes are embarrassing at best. They remind me of cheap \\"Renaissance Faire\\" garb that you can buy for a couple hundred bucks at your local Halloween shop. Where are all the fabulous gowns and jewels that Henry bestowed upon Anne for years before their marriage? Frankly, she looks homely for most of the film. Anyway, if you are looking for a good watch about Anne, or Henry, I recommend The Tudors (offered on Prime for FREE)- it is LUSH and SEXY. Natalie Dormer LIVES and BREATHES the essence of Anne Boleyn. Sorry Miss Portman, you were better as a Black Swan!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Having caught the PBS special I fell in love with this CD....a recent trip to Italy also influenced the purchase!!  The duets are wonderful as well as each solo selection.....play it constantly!!!!  Why is it everything sounds beautiful in Spanish and Italian??!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|when i received my kindle, and this is my first kindle ever, this app is one of the many i installed. a lot of those i installed with it are long uninstalled but this one i'm gonna keep. so good to know that when i need a simple calculator, i don't need to find where i could get one because i have it here in my kindle.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Create game. Worth the price for the full version. Trial version is limited in duels available. Very enjoyable, if you enjoy MTG you will enjoy this app.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Survival craft is basically but less awesome it is really fun the give you a 20  min world but u can always make more worlds ..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I Really like this game, it is addictive though so be warned.  Hope they come up with more levels to this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game I love it ! I can't wait for the new update  . I was hooked the first 5  minutes . Absolutely worth the money I would have paid 20$ for it awesome just awsome
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My brand new Kindle Fire HD - that I've had for 3 days - was giving me \\"low storage\\" warnings even though I have no videos, and only a game or two on it for my kids.  I did not experience this issue with my first Kindle Fire HD (although that one conked out in under a year and Amazon replaced it free of charge)and I suspect it is because I installed the Kindle Freetime app, which has been great except for the fact that I have to delete everything that my kids download immediately otherwise I get a \\"low storage\\" warning.  Anyway, this app cleared out all of the old junk that I couldn't find and freed up about half of my available storage.  Thanks to whomever created this, you've saved my sanity!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is so fun!! Me and my boyfriend have this game and it is awesome, we always spend time together and play it
