B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would read this series a hundred times over, it's so much better than 50 shades!!! Brilliant job Sylvia Day!
B002BWCJOA|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and this is also a great movie. Definitely worth the purchase. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This was not what we expected and I would like to return it and receive a full refund. It was damaged upon receipt and was a Christmas gift so not happy.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I've really enjoyed this version of Sherlock Holmes. I'm a fan of the books/short stories and of the super-detective storytelling genre that came out of that, so this is a great series.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its a fun game and quite the challenge at times. my kids love the characters and the different levels.its a must have for anyone s app collection

1439152802|4.0|In her spellbinding new novel, The Secret Keeper, Gothic novelist Kate Morton spins a family mystery over half a century. Laurel, her three sisters, and her young brother, Gerry, gather in the days after their mother's ninetieth birthday, to nurse her in the final weeks of her life in a London hospital. They work to fit together the pieces of a complicated puzzle of Dorothy Nicholson's childhood to the days prior to her death.  Laurel embarks on a desperate search for the truth about her mother's past where everyone seems to have something to hide. One photograph, of her mother and a woman Laurel has never met, called Vivien--an heiress who was also orphaned when a car crash claimed her parents and siblings in Australia--is her first clue.<br />Rich with detail and lyrical prose, this novel explores longings and dreams, the lengths some people will go to fulfill them, and the strange consequences they sometimes have.  The Secret Keeper is captivating with its story of vivid and visceral characters that are lovers, friends, dreamers and schemers--it is deception told against a backdrop of events that changed the world, and the lives of some its complex characters.  One woman believes being with a brutally cruel man is her penance for something she did as a child, while another woman is in awe of the first, who she assumes lives a charmed life, and conquers a one-sided friendship--yet becomes angry and disillusioned when her unrequited comradeship isn't acknowledged. Her envy and an unrealistic sense of entitlement help fuel her own anger, which ignites an unfounded grudge that is sprinkled with a few grains of greed.  And then there is the man in both of their lives, the innocent photographer who, because of love, gets caught up in a web of deceit and a sordid plot that may not only cause him to lose the love of his life, but may very well cost him his life.<br />This is an intriguing tale that not only entertains, but compels readers to diligently flip through page after enticing page to uncover the details of Dorothy's mysterious past.  When one mystery is uncovered, another puzzling incident arises.<br />The Secret Keeper will have readers rooting for and sympathizing with certain characters; however, as some dreadfully shocking details and disturbing character flaws are revealed, it may cause those very same readers to feel a sense of betrayal for the compassion they allowed themselves to feel for the undeserving. In spite of everything, readers will no doubt enjoy this book as they grow to hate a character or two, while they continue to read, just to see if he or she gets what's coming to them.<br />Morton's novels aren't necessarily formulaic, but they do all seem to follow a similar pattern.  Present day characters run across a clue or two that makes them suddenly keen to delve into their family history, about which they were strangely incurious--and in this particular novel the formula does seem to apply: a daughter's curiosity about her mother's past is triggered by an old photograph and the mystery ensues as the story alternates between 2011 and 1941.<br />Most writers attempt to entertain readers and some writers attempt to convey a story. Then there is the rare group of writers who manage to tell an interesting story that entertains the reader.  The latter is my take on Kate Morton--I must admit I enjoyed the writing style she lends to this story; she is a gifted writer with excellent literary poise which enhances the storyline with astonishing regularity.after enticing page to uncover the details of Dorothy's mysterious past.

B0011UJMK2|5.0|This author jammed so much incredible information into one novel.  I loved that we got to know the protagonist of the story and, even at his worst, still sympathize with him.  The characters were all complex, and I appreciate that when it comes to character development.  Even though I am aware of what went on in Russia under Stalin's regime, to read about Leo, even though he was a fictional character, I could \\"feel\\" what the people must feel like through his character.  Throughout much of the novel I was tense with dread, and I loved that the story could evoke such a strong emotion out of me.<br /><br />The story was riveting from the beginning.  It certainly was not a bright and cheerful story, but it is uplifting in a way.  I found myself living through the characters.  I appreciated that the author allowed us inside the minds of almost every character that was presented to us in such a fluid way.  There were two \\"bad guys\\" in the book, but the author was able to flesh out enough human characteristics that you could sympathize with them both (when I say \\"bad guys\\" I mean the characters who lacked likability and 3-dimensions, for all practical purposes).  To avoid a spoiler, I will avoid discussing who I believe are the \\"bad guys\\" because there are quite a few who could be classified as such.  I will leave it up to the reader to decide.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about communism, Stalin, Russia and human nature.  I felt connected to the characters, story and backdrop.

0446547654|4.0|The book...the story...wonderful!  I have read most of Sparks' books.  My only complaint is that he used to be a &#34;clean author&#34;...no unsavory language, but the last two books I read had some of the d--ns and hells.  Call me a prude, if you will, but The Best of Me also incorporated &#34;Jesus&#34; and &#34;Christ&#34; in non-reverent language, and for that I tend to pull away from the author.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|I came across season one by accident and was hooked after the first show so then I had to continue of course and found season two on ABC but not all the shows so then I did find them on Amazon and was able to purchase them so I could catch up. I would really say this is so different from what I am used to and keeps you guessing on who is who and what is going to happen next. Hope this helps anyone looking into it.....

B006E4QCXU|5.0|I never thought just moving dots around on a screen would be so much fun.  But I spend hours at a time on this game and its so much fun.  Its worth the $0.99 plus tax.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|loved this game and its puzzles. fun fun fun. need more like it G5. Could have been longer and more puzzles as with any good game but it was a delight to play.
B005LAII80|1.0|This review is for the defective product - NOT the film itself.<br /><br />I really liked this movie a lot - which is why I bought the blu-ray when it came out.  However, it won't play on my PS3.  I googled the issue and it seems to be a pretty well documented issue that Lionsgate hasn't addressed.  Many Sony blu-ray players, including the PS3 simply won't play the disc.  It doesn't even read it as being loaded in the disc tray.  This is a huge mistake from Lionsgate and they need to fix it ASAP.  Until then, I have a useless blu-ray that won't play.  Avoid buying this until there is a fix.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game a million times a day.  I just love it.  It's easy, and entertaining, but it has a little challenge to it.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like this game.  It's quite frustrating but I guess that's what people like about it.  I've had this<br />game on my phone and Kindle Fire for some time.  And, my grandsons like it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it! it is definitely as good as 50 shades if grey... I would recommend to anyone looking for something like it.
B005HSL626|2.0|Don't really care for this game.  There doesn't seem to be much involved except a lot of moving your hand.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book the only problem I have is I can't believe the next series doesn't come out until May!  I hate not knowing what is going t  happen next
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent!<br />Addictive series, wonderfully believeable performances by all characters.<br />High quality production; sets /cast /costuming.<br />Interesting mix of villians and hero's.

B00A6RVRXG|5.0|I'm not going to give this a track by track explanation.  This is my first record review for Amazon and I'm a bit conscientious about writing.  This is a great record.  I've been listening to YLT for a long time and this is now my favorite.

B005LAII80|4.0|Dredd is not for the queasy. It is an unrelenting look at justice and the nature of service. This movie clicks on a great number of fronts, subtle and direct. Dredd does not ask for quarter and does not give. That said, if you can handle the unrelenting violence, uncompromising, unflinching, you will likely find this to be one of the best films in this category that you will ever see. The setting is the future, east coast after some unnamed nastiness wiped out most of the US. Per the movie, \\"violent crimes run 17,000 per day. The Judges can respond to 6%\\". So, this is one day in the life of Judge Dredd. This is *not* a remake of the previous movie. This is made of much sterner stuff than that. So, rating it... hmm hmm hmmm<br /><br />Plot: 78% - believable - a bit thin but good<br />Setting: 84% nothing we haven't seen before [think Blade Runner meets Raccoon City]<br />The protagonists: MaMa is pure, unadulterated evil - she knows it and she knows you know... very creepy villain - 94%<br />Judge Dredd - we never see his face. So, as a result, as was attempted in V, he becomes anyone, everyone.. nicely done 92%<br />The Rookie - as we never see the Judge's face, we never \\"don't see\\" the Rookie's she doesn't wear a helmet... nice dichotomy which extends into the idea of innocence vs experience.... Dredd is still *good* but he has no illusions about the world he lives in while you feel the Rookie may: 91%<br />Ambience: IF you can get past the violence [my wife was not able to do so] and accept the movie on it's own terms, it *will* draw you in... 92%<br /><br />overall: 88%- if the violence could have been mitigated, it might have been higher, but if the violence *could* be mitigated, we wouldn't need Judges...
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocal  I'm not a critic so my ratings are based on what I personaly like or dislike.  I like  the Mission Movies and this one was no exception.  As with all Action-Adventure movies here or there are a couple of things that are a little on the far fetched side but what the hell it all gets pulled together as the movie goes along.  If you like this kind of movie, then buy it.  If you don't, well, to each his own.  Herb.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Worked fine for two months -- then the covering of the part that goes into the computer came loose when taking it out.  Also became unreliable.  Picture would cut out and if you jiggled the wire it would work again.  I use for classroom presentations and I need it to be reliable.  I've ordered the real Mac one.  Hope it works better.
B00003CXDG|5.0|I have all of the Mission movies and like them all.  I had this one on tape but when my hearing went bad I couldn't get the Closed Captioning so I bought the DVD.
B005FPT51K|1.0|Ibaby should actually be recalled and removed from the shelves because it does not work. If you're aiming to view your baby from outside the home, DO NOT buy this item as it will NEVER work. It is a huge pain to set up and the reward is ZERO as it crashes constantly. If you think you'll be able to watch your baby from your iphone, you're WRONG. Great in theory, but worthless in reality.
B008GVSOCQ|5.0|Liked it so much I watched another movie to go with it, Pride and Prejudice. That made me want to watch a movie about Jane Austen
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is good but katniss seems meaner in this book but it is a good ending to the trilogy
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I couldn't love this game more!! If you have any doubts about buying this app, then get rid of them. This game is worth more than 3 dollars!!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I feel like I've been taken.  Book 1 was interesting but book 2 was boring, I finished it just because I bought it, however, I won't be wasting more money on book 3.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I'm more fond of Alicia's first albums.<br /><br />This album is quite ok, though.<br /><br />She obviously made a lot of progress in sound harmony.<br /><br />Good.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|This movie is better then I expected! Great for my 3D tv, one of the best 3D movies out there.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have always loved doing hair.... but this is more fun than doing a real persons hair. Being able to curl cut straighten dye etc. On an electronic device is a lot more fun to me. The graphics are really good. Even though the people are kind of strange looking I still love this game
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is the best book that I have ever read if u want to read a book to remember then you need to read a walk to rember
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I was riveted by the first book, but after reading these reviews and seeing the supposed \\"publisher's\\" greedy price of $19.99 for this  Kindle book, I plan on skipping it. NOTE TO PUBLISHERS; GET REAL ON THE PRICING OF THESE E-READS! Seriously, why would I pay $20 for a book I can't pass on, lend, gift or donate? I'll wait until I can get it at Goodwill, after some poor sap has plopped down $35 for a hard copy only to donate it next year some time... Your readers have a brain, especially if they are reading books such as this. Give us some credit. We were promised that E books would never go beyond $10. How can you justify this price, when there are literally thousands of other books at less than $10, just waiting to be sampled. Give me this book at a reasonable price and I may consider it, if I don't just forget it exists bcause there is so much other interesting material out there. If you honestly can tell me that it costs you $2o to deliver this book electronically, I'd be happy to hear that argument.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All three books atr great.  Have read them several times.  I can not say enough good things about these books.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a fun book to read. A few typos, but well worth your time. It should be in print.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Very well-written, as are all her books.  Exciting to follow all the workings of a large hotel, especially involving the suites.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Hey, it's Rush, what more can I say? There are very, very few Rush songs that I don't care for, so I am not the best person to critique the album. That being said, I really like it!
B003O86FMW|3.0|wasnts too empressed. love Katniss and Peeta but gets soo boring at times. i would not buy the 3rd book after finding out the end from other spoilers.
B005LAII80|4.0|This disc gets a 1 STAR rating from me due to the LACK of 3D! NO DEPTH! You could watch this in the 3D mode without the glasses, and the image is, for the most part, normal (not blurry)?!! Another disc that fails to make it in my 3D collection!!! Oh Dredd... almost leaves you wanting the Stallone/Schneider version instead?<br /><br />UPDATE...<br />Changed the rating to a 4 star.<br />Seems I must have had one of those defective disc?? Due to some people saying the 3D was great, I figured I'd chance buying Dredd again... this time from the UK site, in hope of a better result?! Turns out the UK version worked great. Noticed it right from the begining with the opening credits of red text on black background. There was definatley depth in the text, which isn't seen on my previous US purchase!<br />It just gets better from there!!

B0060ANOXY|5.0|Roger Waters can be a bit of a downer, but he finds the high notes of life to counter the darkness.<br /><br />I love this album.  It sounds as fresh and relevant as when it came out.  I couldn't listen to this everyday, but what Roger Waters or Pink Floyd album could be?<br /><br />To listen to this album all the way through is what gives it the power that it does.  Albums are not created as whole products much anymore because there are not many musicians with the gift that Waters has.<br /><br />Singles and autotune are what the youth today have. They are missing out on the depth, power and beauty of music that is reflected in this album.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The Dark Knight does rise. The conclusion of the Dark Knight trilogy is fantastic. Good writing, great acting, incredible effects. Surprise ending with twists will leave the viewer hungry for more.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh gets the reader so close to her main character, an aged-out foster teen, that it hurts. Then she reveals to us a rich new language we can use to express those feelings we are experiencing.  Marvelous journey.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book had been recommended to me but I knew it was a series of letter and I could not imagine liking it.  Boy, was I wrong.  A beautifully written book with great character development and storyline.  I want to go to Guernsey!

B00ATPVA78|4.0|nice storyline graphics and music.  Too short. otherwise interesting and easy to follow.  Mini games a little difficult. not enough ho games.
B000I2J6K0|3.0|I almost didn't do the workout...it takes place in her cluttered living room. But, since I rented it decided to give it a chance.<br />Pros:<br />It gets your heart rate up but not too high<br />It works your entire body<br />It draws from pilates, yoga and dance all in one workout<br /><br />If you expect your fitness crazy friend coming to your living room and leading you in some exercise then this is good. It's not a professional workout video. At one point she even runs out of the room mid workout because she has to pee. If you don't mind this, it's a very good aerobic, full body, diverse workout.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|just great and lots of fun for hours so simple yet rewarding.  very interesting and best for all ages and family fun.
B003VPWX6K|4.0|Not quite as charming as Downton Abbey, but still very enjoyable if you like the dynamics between English aristocrats and their servants.

0061906220|5.0|This is one of the most delightful books I have read to the grandkids in ages!<br /><br />Pete the Cat teaches to accept &#34;different/change&#34; with laid back humor.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This novel was nice, mellow, and true, much like Charlie. I loved the calm pace that still kept me interested and the characters that were believable because the were not ridiculous or to plain. They felt like people I could find two of each on the streets with minimal differences ,and that's what I loved about them. It was nice to have a plain book with real high school drama that is not blown out of proportion by the characters. But at the same time, I don't like it for those reasons. They are traits of this novel I love but can't like.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I hadn't seen a single episode of this show until last week, and had no idea what it was that might separate this show from any of the others in the genre.<br /><br />After noting the extremely high percentage of 5-star ratings, out of nearly 400 reviews for Season 1, and the remarkably high percentage out of the nearly 300 reviews for Season 2, and reading the specifics conveyed by others in their reviews, I had to see for myself what so many had found so compelling about this show.<br /><br />I initially thought this show was simply a combination of 'vampire' + 'high school', but that's SO NOT IT.  Of the various reviews I read, what became pivotal for me were those which were from people who did not consider themselves fans of the genre, and those which commented regarding the show having exceptional writing -- and I happen to now be among the chorus of those singing the praises of this show, and belong to both of those 'camps'.<br /><br />Although I saw the Twilight movies, I wasn't all that impressed by them -- the stories or the acting.  When I checked out True Blood (again, to see what all the fuss was about :) ), I enjoyed Season 1, wasn't such a fan of Season 2, and really liked Season 3.  However, this show strikes me as being relatively peerless -- it's simply that good, and I don't know what even comes close.  I continue to marvel at the exceptional storylines, which are not only paired with phenomenal writing, involving truly remarkable creativity, and skilled pacing, but fantastic acting.<br /><br />I'm blown away by this show, and am utterly delighted to have found a show whose incredible storylines downright fascinate me, and keep me spellbound, from episode, to episode.  In working my way through the Season 1 set, I initially didn't understand what the fuss was all about -- however, after certain initial specifics were fleshed out (no pun intended), it became apparent that this was no ordinary show, and I soon found myself in that delightful state of anticipation, after each episode concluded -- I had to watch the next one, right away... :)<br /><br />And that 'snowballing' of anticipation and practically being mesmerized by the show was even more true of Season 2 -- holy crap, WHAT A SEASON!  It's like they laid the groundwork in Season 1 for a stunning 'lift off', in Season 2 -- the creativity and stunningly wonderful writing are 'off the charts' in this season.<br /><br />I can't recommend this show highly enough.  I happen to be a sci-fi fan, and enjoy when it crosses into what is deemed to be within the fantasy realm, and find ventures into the supernatural to be fertile ground for great stories, but am not 'hardcore' regarding any genre -- my preference, above all, is for great stories -- and this show delivers it in abundance.<br /><br />For anyone who might be 'on the fence', and among those who, like me (until last week, that is) hadn't seen an episode of this show, I hope you decide to give it a try, as there is so much to enjoy about this wonderful series.<br /><br />Great stories, great writing, and great execution (again, no pun intended [lol]) -- it's got it all!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book sucks you in right away, and I LOVED LOVED LOVED 75% of it. Then the end is just horrible and makes it feel like a total waste of time.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I would have given 4 stars but the ending to this great story was a cop-out.  I didn't like the mother throughout the book, but her husband's seeming defense of what she pulled in the end was beneath him.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is one of the better books that I have read in a long while. Eben's experiences were truly a page turner. I have recommended this book to my colleagues and friends. Very heart warming.
091581112X|4.0|It's a great book and I highly suggest it to help with a detailed method to &#34;re-center&#34; and basque in positive energy, but the quality of the used &#34;LIKE NEW&#34; condition... was not... very good. The cover was detached, there was some writing in the columns, and looked to have slight water damage. I don't mind it, but it wouldn't be appropriate to give as a gift.

I didn't want something that would be uncomfortable to watch with all the sexual inuendos that are so common these days, but I knew I needed to make a selection that would keep his attention.  This was a very good choice.  A bit immature for his taste he admitted, afterall he is almost 16. However, he also conveys that he found it to be captivating enough once it got rolling to keep him smiling at times and his curiosity peeked. I suspect, he enjoyed it more than he is allowing me to know.  He has an image to maintain.  I come to this conclusion because I could see him curled up with his bulldog patting her and smiling at times as he watched \\"TinTin and Snowflake\\" on their adventure.  This movie, although animated seems very realistic and has the tempo of \\"Speed\\" with Sandra Bullock, if you've ever seen that one.  I was truely impressed with the ingenuity of one predicament after another and the outcome.  Neither of us were familiar with any of \\"TinTin's\\" works previously.  We found it overall unexpectedly a good memory for both during a not so good sick day for him.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun to play with your kids.  Little ones like the prizes it is just a shame that most fall of the side before you can collect them.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|This is a very good movie, but not quite as good as The Dark Knight. The blu-ray extras are terrific.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Movie was good, but too short.  If you are a Resident Evil fan you will like it.  I do like the twist at the end with the little girl.
B00867GHS8|4.0|This is a great story, but the 3D conversion is disappointing. The 3D in Disney's Tangled is vastly superior, because it was created as 3D from the beginning.
1609611543|5.0|...then read this book!! I've read a lot of health books over the years but this one blew my socks off. I always knew I wasn't very tolerant to wheat products, but just like everyone else I assumed that I had no choice and kept on eating bread, cereals, and pasta, albeit in moderation. One day something propelled me to find some kind of information on wheat and educate myself. To my horror, all the afflictions I've been living with since infancy were clearly defined and explained in this book (with humour and elegance); conditions I've had to just put up with and was told by many doctors that it's &#34;genetic&#34; or &#34;I'm getting older&#34; or some other ignorant diagnosis. Thanks to this book (and Dr. Davis), I went cold turkey 3 months ago and the first things that happened were loss of 8 pounds, flat stomach, no arthritis pain (I'm only 42!), and excellent bowel movements (sorry for the TMI). If you do nothing else, just read this book, cut out wheat for 3 months, and decide for yourselves. You'll NEVER go back!
B0057UA4FY|4.0|My boy loves it and can't wait until I buy season two. He lives and breaths everything Star Wars and this was a great choice, especially for long trips in the car where he can play one episode after another.
B004G6009U|5.0|I Love this movie. I found myself zoned into it when my daughter was watching it. I think it is very entertaining and recommend it to everyone
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is really well written. Cheryl intertwines her hike with the story of her past. You can easily picture the people she describes and the trail. I am sure there are already hundreds of reviews so I won't go on. If you are a woman you should definitely get this book.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|My family's favorite Christmas movie.  Cracks them up every time.  Came quickly and in time for Christmas.  Lots of laughs.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This product seems to be all it is advertised to be.  I have only used it for a few days, but it seems to be functioning as expected.<br />The styling is very good, but a less slippery case would be nice.<br />It would be nice if a wall charger were included, but most of us have one already.<br />One major design feature that is missing and badly needed is a \\"full charge shut down\\" when the unit has reached full charge capacity.  The instructions state that, \\"To protect the long-term capacity of your device's battery #assumed to be the subject battery pack#. we recommend you unplug the power wire promptly after the device is fuly charged.\\"  This is a pain in the neck as you have to be present at the precise moment the charge is complete.<br />All in all, however, I would recommend this product and especially Laptopmate.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|These items are easy to use and trouble free.  Vendor shipped in a timely manner and while not super cheap, is a good value.  I love being able to download my photos to my ipad!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book is one of his best. Hard to put down once you start reading. Loved it. If you are a fan of Tom Clancy, you need to read this book.
0761169431|5.0|Our 9 year old grandson can fold and make anything from paper. This was a choice gift for him to challenge his origami abilities.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Loved the plot, animation and characters! Over all a really good movie. I was really surprisedthe makers of Coraline did it again!
1401207138|5.0|This is a gift for an adult grandson collector and he is thrilled with it.  It was shipped and received very quickly.  Absolutely no problems with this order.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story pushes the limit on what can be seen on TV.  Adult content.  If things scare you easily be warned.  This is the best bone chilling show in a long time.  Jessica Lang is at her best!
B007KB15BA|5.0|They still have it going on - great album - just love it, Blood of the nations was great too
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Pretty good movie.  Bad guys could have been less goofy, but I could overlook that.  Special effects were great!  And the little guy gets to be a hero also.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Parental Warning: This film is a solid PG-13 for good reason. It's not a children's movie, even though younger kids will be drawn to it by the earlier productions in the series. My suggestion is to gauge whether a kid is ready for it by requiring that they read the book first.  If they can get through the monstrously-sized novel, after reading the other Potter novels, then they're probably able to understand the events than unfold.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|Hi dear amazon associates, I love Batman's Movies by C. Nolan. I bought this movie pack expecting to find extra videos with interviews, making of the movie, etc, for each movie. But, unfurtunately, only the third DVD with the movie &#34;Tha Dark Knight Rises&#34; had only ONE extra video with an interview to C. Nolan. However, the little book with pictures related to the three movies was great.
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|When I rented this I had never heard of it and now I know why. This was the worst movie that M M has maid and I can't believe someone spent money on it including me.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My son loved building the camper.  The creativity and details that were included were wonderful.  My son is only 11, and it took him about 12-14 hours to build.
B0026O475M|4.0|This is a great movie, it shows the determination and how I feel a lot of things would actually happen
B004097IKW|5.0|The DVD was delivered in the time allotted.<br />Any Juan Diego Florez opera is a joy to watch and to listen to.<br />However we have not yet played the disk, which we presume will be in good order
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Sure, it's not Jason Bourne, but Jeremy Renner is so refreshing as Aaron Cross.  You might miss Bourne for a few minutes and then you forget all about him for awhile as they've developed this wonderfully exciting character.  I haven't met anyone that watched BOURNE LEGACY that wasn't extremely impressed and most of us that are major BOURNE fans were very skeptical at first.  You have to give it a chance!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Game is very easy to learn, put the puzzles progress in difficulty as you go.  Hopefully the developer is working on more levels.  I really like how the handle the star ratings on each level.  If you are the type who has to get 3 stars on every level, this game is great since you can see while you are playing the level what you need to do to get all of the stars.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|The kids love it! They've watched it over and over and took it to slumber parties. I enjoyed it too
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed it very much!! Can't wait to read the next book, as soon as I get it downloaded this evening...
B0000DJZB9|5.0|Yes, guns n roses, incredible rock band. Live and let die a very important song for the modern day. These collections of music videos are great.
1847371663|5.0|People are very quick to judge a drug user, or do not necessarily understand the intensity of addiction. This was an awesome book to see how a millionaire rock star hit rock bottom due to his drug addiction. It really gives the reader an inside perspective into the mind of a drug addict. The psychological implication Nikki Sixx faces are just fascinating! I would recommend this book to an older audience who has any interest in drugs, the life of a rock star, or psychology
B0000TB014|5.0|Don't they call him the king of pop. I can see why, he's smooth, classy, irresistable. His songs are timeless and his voice is couoing. He's really got it all. He's fit, dark, tall, attractive, dances, sings, dresses to a T, and brings his A charm to every scene.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This is a new series for me, but I love the Castle show, so I thought I'd enjoy Nikki Heat and I definately did.  Try it, you'll like it.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I'm not too sure about this artist, but the information that Amazon provided made for an easy sell on a well composed Dvd.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|to know how close they followed the storyline. The slomo action was a great way to do some awesome scenes!
B00023B1AS|5.0|ZZ Top are classicly inspired rock n roll stars with the right moves, songs, and talent. Haven't watched this yet but if it's anything like their previous shows I'm in for a treat.
B000294SFW|5.0|This cd has great heavy guitar playing.If you play guitar you will want this cd to jam with.One of motorhead better jamming cd.
0307887448|5.0|I was a teenager in the 80's and lived pretty close to where many of the recreated environs are set. That was interesting. I'm also a big fan of VR. This book was jam packed with 80s cultural references which was interesting. It was also packed with geek references. As the first person with a computer at my school, it all brought back memories (48k). I liked that most of the references were plausibly explained, but some were not. For example the antagonist's alias was 655321 which comes from A Clockwork Orange. Also Harry Tuttle, the protagonist's perfect pseudonym, was from the movie Brazil. Besides being a festival of 80's trivia (I never realized so much happened then!) the book was genuinely a good read. Very exciting and imaginative.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Everything you want at your finger tips...love it..no problems. Find myself looking up recipes &amp; general handy tips all the time.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|It becomes amazing to realize the current degradation of the english language compared to the outstanding descriptions of persons, places and things by  Arthur Conan Doyle. Have we become a world of 'instantang gratification ' through smart phones, movies and television?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact is a story that really makes you think, like most Jodi Picoult books. What would you do if your son was accused of killing his girlfriend? The girlfriend being your best friend's daughter and the kids meeting when he was 6 months old and she was a few hours old. They grew up together and everyone knew they would eventually be together. When secrets are revealed, what would you do? This book is fully of suspense and love. Highly recommended!
B000FVE3A2|5.0|This watch is heavy but for me it feels great on the wrist...I have been comparing this to my atomic digital watch and it is keeping nearly in sync with my atomic. This watch does have a Seiko NH35A movement which hacks and is top notch.I would highly recommend this watch to people that want a watch that looks great and functions great as well for a fraction of the price of other automatics in its class.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although I finished reading the book just to see how it would end and because of all the rave reviews, I did not particularly like it.  Everyone in the whole book was flawed, and, it seemed everyone &#34;lost&#34; in the end.  How depressing!
B004J4WLPU|4.0|great read. keeps you guessing till the end. makes you appreciate your siblings. Good book for book club discussion.  recommended
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Basically I enjoyed the book.  However as a murder mystery, it was a bit too obvious.  As a possibility of what could happen to the Bennets sisters and their spouses...well that part was actually comforting.  Since I love Pride and Prejudice and have mused in the past on the marriages of Jane, Elizabeth and Lydia...yeah was nice.  Not great but worth a read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really good book. better thgan expected. I would reccommend it to anyone, that likes a good Grisham book. It's a buy.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I can't see all my old tweets and it has trouble backtracking so I can't see some of the older tweets. My notifications are delayed and I get them faster on my cellphone. It is nice to have for quick updates but do not use it exclusively.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I choose this rating because of the totally believable story lie.  I am a romantic at heart and this book has a lot of romance in the pages. Great read!  It makes me want to fall in love again.
B005Q1W10A|2.0|This has nothing to do with the fabulous Downton episodes, only poor marketing by Amazon. It was frustrating to try and find out if this season 2 UK edition really did have \\"special features\\" included. I looked through most of the comments and could not determine if it really did have any included along with the special Christmas episode.  Of course Amazon description said that there were no special features. I was also frustrated with the price bouncing around from $26-$29 within an hour or less. As a result, I finally went to Target, found out it did have special features and got it for about $26.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Not only am I learning a lot, I can't put it down.  Wonderful book - haven't finished it yet and I really hate the thought of finishing.  Highly recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an addicting game. It starts out so simple but progressively gets harder. Some games in the higher levels are very challenging. I've almost made it through all the free levels.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Light reading. Typical kind of plot.  Romantic and mouse and cat games! Easy read but not a very strong literary read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Being a fan of zombie movies my whole life- this show is perfect. I honestly hope each episode never ends.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|If you like deadmau5 in general, this is a fun album. I don't have a detailed review, but a lot of good ones have been provided by other purchasers.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I only follow three shows- this is one. Can't wait for the next episode- which is what I say every week!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Thanks for the movie. Was more than able to catch up on one of my favorite shows. SOA is amazing
B009NPK1IO|4.0|This season has its good and bad parts- what else can happen on this show? I think they cover it all by the end.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|One of the best books i have read in a long long time.  Definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great read.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I found this book pretty interesting.  I did a quick skim and wow things jumped out it me.  I began to slow down and read word for word and well I liked these logical honest approaches to communication.  A great read, for those wanting to improve a bit!
B0073COMKW|2.0|Some parts of the description says this is dimmable, the other sections says it isn't... then it says it is in some fixtures.  It is listed in the \\"Dimmable\\" section of Amazon's search...<br /><br />Well here's the clear answer for anybody who is wondering which description is correct: it is not dimmable.  May work great for non-dimmable fixtures.
B001BANK32|5.0|After seeing the movie again, I decided to read the book for a second time. The book develops the characters to a much greater degree, which makes for a better story. Jack,s decent into madness is more comprehensive in the book, for instance. The Danny/Tony character is also expanded on greatly there. The movie misses out on Danny's thought process. He is as much of the protagonist  as Jack.
B009E3EY38|5.0|My wife and I really like the Led Zeppelin Celebration Day Deluxe Edition.  It really brings back our high school memories.  Also, great shipping speed.  Got it in two days.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Just what my sister wanted.  Easy to purchase great price!  Shipped quickly, received it just in time for Christmas wrapping.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Not as bad as I thought the third installment would be, definitely better then #2. On a boring night, it's a good watch.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app. the meter is very accurate. love that you can put the battery gauge in your widget bar. use this app every day on my kindle fire. I highly recommend it. it is amust have for any smart device or tablet owner.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A good book that gripped me from beginning to the painful end. I would recommend this book to anyone. Also, if you are thinking about buying this book, do it.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this app is simple and easy to use but it does not work on the kindle fire. you can only make the screen change colors. I think that the kindle fire does not contain the part(a camera flash bulb) that allows this app to turns it in to a flashlight. all the other functions work great but if you want a flash light I don't think the kindle can become one. the only light the kindle fire has is the screen ,which surprisingly is very bright in the dark.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this weather app for my Kindle. You can get the weather any time or place you are at.

B00A757EFW|4.0|this demo is pretty fun haha i would recommend buying the full version if you like pacman. the demo isnt long enough lol
B00A8ECU24|1.0|It's constantly crashing. I can't go to the store without it crashing. The ponies  that cost gems are priced too high. And I can't even get to customer service to tell gameloft about this without it crashing! Nice job gameloft. It doesn't even deserve a star. Much less my money.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|For the most part the app does what it is supposed to, but occasionally it force closes.<br />overall i enjoy using it.
B001UU75WK|3.0|...particularly, formula science fiction mixed with a formulaic police procedural, you will probably be satisfied by Fringe.  It takes essentially the core premise of The X-Files, substitutes more conventional characters (a tough female cop, a roguish/sarcastic male figure, a mad scientist, a stern/disapproving supervisor, and an attractive assistant), lots more obvious and loud action and melodrama, a more conventional pace and aesthetic, and plots that get right to the obvious points relatively quickly.  If you're ok with formulaic entertainment (and many are, believing all drama needs to do to be worthwhile is provide an \\"escape\\"), none of this will bother you.  You won't notice the difference--in fact, you might even think the familiarity/accessibility/lack of challenge/credibility deficits make this an improvement on headier material.  But if you will only commit to a show (or only enjoy fantasy/science fiction) that transcends obvious entertainment formulas and uses the genre to explore real ideas and conflicts (as I believe The X-Files did and the best fantasy and science fiction do), then you will likely be disappointed as stereotypical characters race through formulaic plots and spout dialogue intended more to help audiences follow along than to reveal character or create genuine drama.  All of that said, I think Anna Torv does quite a bit with the limited material, showing smarts and charisma even as she finds her character in generic situations, dealing with relatively flat characters.  Jackson, who I have enjoyed elsewhere, is charming, but in my view does not convey the maturity or depth necessary to make Peter a credible or genuine character (rather than merely an attractive, unthreatening delivery system for mood-lightening jokes and \\"let's explain things for Olivia/the audience\\" dialogue).  Yes, Mulder was also funny/sarcastic, but David Duchovny conveyed genuine intelligence, passion, and defiance as well and seemed like a real person/rounded character rather than an ingredient in a formula.  So formula fans, enjoy the \\"best show ever\\"; discerning viewers/those who appreciate artistic science fiction, don't expect more than time-killing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read in two afternoons.  What a great read.  Excellent for all age groups, but as a late twenties adult, who has managed two businesses, and saw it as an excellent leadership read.  Enjoy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Words cannot describe how awesome this show is!!!!! If you start from season one, you won't stop....its awesome.....a must watch
B0053O89WY|5.0|I give this a five star review because it was shipped quickly and because it is completely new as described. Great reliability.
B009X011UQ|5.0|I was not sure about this case after reading the reviews but I love it it is lightweight but it also seems to protect it very well! Very satisfied!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked 50 shades of Grey then this is a must read. I couldn't put it down. The third book i'm sure will not disappoint!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Midnight in Paris is utterly charming and delightful while still having more substance than the typical fluffy romantic comedy. Its about the unsatisfied yearning everyone feels at some point for a way of life that exists only in our own heads and the ultimate realization that in order to be happy we have to find a way to accept reality for what it is and appreciate the magic in real life. If that sounds too pseudo-philosophical, the movie has moment after moment of exuberant comedy and utterly joyous movie magic.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I have seen it before, just great all the way around. All star cast and an early roll for Emily Blunt
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!  Easy read and can't wait for the next book to come out.  Gideon is hot!
1423151054|4.0|Pros:<br />*Nice hard sturdy display box to keep books protected<br />*Flip books are hard covered. This is fantastic! Normally, flip books are soft covered which leaves them looking very worn and bent in a short period of time. These books are easy to flip and are surrounded by a hard cover to keep the pages flat and in tip top shape!<br />*Still keeps the &#34;feel&#34; of the series with beautiful sturdy binding and printing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*I thought there would be &#34;more&#34;. The books are only single sided, so there's only one short scene of animation for each animator,  leaving the back of the pages blank. This would have been prime real estate for a double sided flip book with 2 shots from each animator. It would have made this set 10x better. (Flip the book one way and see one animation, turn it over and flip the other way to see a different one). I don't like seeing the wasted blank space when it really could have been used to take it the extra mile. But overall, that's the only major con I can think of but it was is a pretty big let down for me.<br />*Even though it still has the &#34;feel&#34; of the previous books, it's a bit difficult to envision this a part of them. Not sure where to store it on the bookshelf since it's more of a collector/gift set than a new installment in the series.<br /><br />I also created a full flip-through video of the flipbooks on my Youtube channel. Just head over to youtube and do a search there for gfWP6NOa6AE and the video should pop up :)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun and exciting to read. Loved it.<br />It takes you up and down through a relationship everyone wants.<br />Highly Recommended

B009CG11WY|5.0|This movie is one of my top favorites. No matter who you are, you can find something to love about it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like this game!  Enjoy Mahjong and was glad to find it for my Kindle Fire.  The tiles are very small, tho.  Hard to see sometimes, but overall, it's a fun app, and has many different game styles to play.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I had it for about 3 days.  Never could connect with any of my friends, and then it just crashed.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a real cliff hanger....I can't figure out what the ending will be!  Hope to finish it tonight.  It's a great read and has a plot line like I've never seen before and I read a lot of books!!!!!!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Deftones shows no signs of slowing down here. Their momentum is strong and Chino still has his voice after all these years.<br /><br />In this album, there is no rapping. The heavy riffs are akin to the ones heard in Diamond Eyes, only heavier. Definitely a different tone from the previous albums. More atmospheric and the lyrical theme is different. Many of the tracks feel like you'd hear them on other tracks. \\"Leathers\\" Sounds like a track you'd hear off White Pony. \\"Entombed\\", and many other tracks sound like they'd be in Saturday Night Wrist.<br /><br />Personally, my favorite song off this record are \\"Poltergeist\\" and \\"Rosemary\\".
B008QTVNUI|3.0|It's okay but it's too soap-operaish for my taste.  I've watch 3 segments, so I'll give it a chance before I make my final decision.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Different from the usual romance novel with heart, strong wills and real love amongst friends. Awesome read. This is one I'LL never forget!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl did not come up to my expectations.  It was given such great reviews, but I found it a bit unreal and over rated<br /> I have also purchased her novel DARK PLACES and look forward  to reading that to see how it compares
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Went to the theater to see it, decided that this would be a movie I would watch many times in the coming months, so I knew I would want to buy it. Then I upgraded my PC and added a Blu-Ray player to it, so then I knew which movie I wanted to see again in Blu-Ray and I was not disappointed.
B00A2IUHM6|3.0|I am a fan of Seth McFarlane's works I like Family Guy, American Dad, and The Cleveland Show. This movie was not as funny as I had anticipated. It was a good laugh but I believe the hype behind it is not justified. I would classify this as a comedy with romance undertones.
1435122968|5.0|B and N has done a beautiful job collecting almost all of Lovecrafts work in a terrific single volume. No dust jacket but a beautifully crafted work with insightful introductory paragraphs preceding each tale by famed scholar ST Joshi.<br />Inexpensive and an amazing value. Gilt edge pages, nice font, just a terrific book lovers book. This is the Lovecraft  collection  to get.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I rented this but the rental window expired and I was unable to view it. a reminder that it is about to expire would be nice.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have not read this book as yet because I'm saving it for a trip to Mexico which Will be taken soon.  However, I did read the story several years ago in a Lit class and have seen the recent movie so I know the book will be enjoyable reading and I will find details missed or not used earlier.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I was not sure if I was going to like this. This seemed like the type of movie that al the funny parts were in the trailer. I was surprised that it was pretty funny and the characters in the movie worked well with each other.
0525952926|4.0|This book continues the first book of the Century Trilogy and lets you find out what happens to the families featured in the first novel.  Many of your questions are satisfied to a degree and will only be fully answered when Mr. Follette completes the third book. It is a sort of &#34;historical mystery&#34;.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I am sure by now most people have seen the avengers movie and I am late with this review but I order alot of amazon and do not get a chance to review everything in a timely manner. Anyways it is a great movie. If you for some reason have not seen it buy it today!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Yuck. Poorly written with a missing plot and character understanding. Not worth the time required to read it. Avoid. Avoid
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Looking forward to reading the other 2 in this trilogy.  I'm still amazed how quickly the book load onto my Kindle.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always, exceptionally well-researched for acciuyate technical details, ans then combine with oputstanding writing to create a most readable and enjoyable suspense thriller/
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is not as good as the 1st book, but still very good.  Looking forward to reading the last book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, exciting, puzzling, challenging, thrilling, suspenseful, and thoroughly enjoyable one chapter after another un til reaching a very satisfying conclusion.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|So, wow. I have never imaged life as a chef in the same light as Mr. Bourdain has shed it in. It was truly an eye opener an<br />an amusing read with many tidbits a future wannabe chef should keep in mind.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Esta multi herramienta esta mejor de lo que esperaba, el cuchillo corta como un bisturi y conserva bien el filo, la tijera tambien es muy robusta, el alicate preciso y robusto, el mecanismo de traba muy bien pensado para no tener problemas y sufrir cortes, y en general luce genial. vamos de pesca.
034580404X|5.0|My grand daughter LOVED these books.  She went crazy when she received them.  I couldn't count the times she thanked me.  She has already read them and loves them.  Thank you Amazon.
B0071R43MG|5.0|Satch siempre con lo ultimo, buen concierto, buenos temas, una de las cosas que me gusta y que jamas hubiese pensado es el hecho de a todas las canciones Mike acompa&ntilde;a con extraordinarios arreglos en teclado para todas las canciones, realmente este concierto esta de lujo.<br /><br />Hey Joe, lanza &#34;live in san francisco&#34; en bluray, sere el primero en comprarlo.
0393316041|5.0|I really loved this book so I bought one for my dad, who also loved it.  Feynman is a great writer, and has a lot of interesting and funny stories in his book.  The book also, isn't very scientific, which makes it nice if you're reading it for leisure.  I also really liked his method for squaring numbers in his head.  It's definitely helped me with my mental math.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|They just get better and better with every album!!! I loved it!!! I reccomend this to anyone who loves well made music :D
1440503257|4.0|I got this for my girlfriend (who loves to cook).  She loves it.  We've tried a few of the recipes and they've all turned out pretty good!  My only issue is that a lot of the ingredients are hard to find/expensive (i.e. phesant, lamb, etc..).
B007NMN2US|5.0|This is a nice little addition to any Batman fans' collection. the keyring is durable and withstands the everyday usage of keys constantly being handled daily. Shows no signs of wear and tear or vulnerability.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|After listening to this album in it's entirety  on excessive repeat, I must say I am really excited about this album. Some of the songs, and riffs are very dark, but as an artist, I feel he pushed the envelope going to places lyrically that some  artists can't touch.  I also feel a Maxwell vibe. Like Maxwell's debut album \\"Urban Hang Suite, it tells a story in chronological order.  I love the music, the lyrics, and his voice.  This is truly a sexy album with a 90s vibe that can be played throughout.  \\"Coming Down,\\" \\"XO/The Host,\\" \\"In the Zone,\\" and \\"The Birds Pt 1 and 2\\"are just a few favorites. Buy it, Buy it, and oh yeah? did I mention Buy It ? :)
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was my first Baldacci book and really enjoyed it, so much so the next book I purchased was The Forgotten
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This site went straight to the text, without any need of a password or anything.  It is not the version I most want , but  I rate it higher for ease of access.  I appreciate ease of access to stuff; should not have to jump through so many hoops to get to stuff.  Id rather pay a one-time fee, and then be left alone.
0761171703|5.0|gave this as a gift to a dancer friend who lives in Chicago so many of the pics are of Chicago it turned out to be really cool for her.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|it won't let me have friends other then the princess.  it also made 9 gems dissapear. it is still a fun game.
B00447G2T8|5.0|Even though this  lp is a darker one for  Helloween<br />It  is none the less one of their  best  from the  Andi Deris era
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent a must read, I could not put it down. It leaves you wanting more and more, can't wait for the third book in this triolgy.
B00000J2SR|5.0|Bent out of shsape is one of the best CRainbow  lps from the JLT era<br />Unlike Grahamr Bonnet( who  sang on  down to earth)<br />Mr . Turner  has a voice  which  wa born in Power Metal Heaven...<br />He has inspired  the likes of Tony harnell And other  metal vocalists...<br />Richie Blackmore is a great guitarist, with  a terrible ego<br />Other than that  Rainbow is one band that I wish would come back with the  turner/Blackmore  line up<br /><br />Bent Out of Shape is One of the greatest  Power Metal lps  ever made
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose this rating because I got absorbed into her world. It was well written and the characters were visible and believable to me.
0345803485|5.0|This book was &#34;almost&#34; more than I could handle. I need a long break before reading the next one in the series. I did enjoy reading it... but....
B0086700CM|3.0|it's not amazing or anything.but does keep me busy when I'm bored. I can't complain much, it's free and helps me burn the extra time on my hands.
1455519006|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was a page-turner from the start. If you can dedicate a full day or two to a book, go for it. It is time well spent, unless you should be doing something else! :)
B004GYY714|5.0|I like how you can listen to various radio stations both local and international.Never came across an app like this. I highly recommend it.
B005JABSB6|5.0|No complains. I have been using them to watch a variety of TV shows (movies/documentary/sports/cartoons) from these Direct TV free 3D channels, and the view is AWESOME. No complains at all. Size does fit great over my prescription glasses feeling comfortable using them. I use the 'nose adapter' as it is smooth. Battery has good duration and I do love the option of watching on 2D while others are watching on 3D. Once I confirmed this product exceeded my expectations, I did buy the more of the same model for the rest of my family.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is a beautiful app. I am not worried about the permissions . I listen to my favourite radio stations from shout cast through this. Those who don't like the app please uninstall it
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Not one of Eastwood's best but entertaining. Good chemistry between all characters. Liked Justin Timberlake. I would recommend to others.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Before XiiaLive I was using TuneIn for streaming my favorite radio stations. Overall, I like the UI and feel of XiiaLive better. But... TuneIn has a far superior number of radio stations. That's not a deal breaker for me because I was able to find every single station I listen to on TuneIn here on XiiaLive, but it's not as intuitive to find them simply because they are listed just by the name/number and don't have the station's logo which would make the experience a lot more enjoyable. The one thing that keeps me using the app on a regular basis is the ability to tag songs with such ease and then look up the song for download, all within XiiaLive.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the kind of story that seeps into your mind and won't let you sleep until it's done with you.
B002U1F32M|5.0|I really like this movie. Such a cute story and a heartbreaking one all at the same time. Watch it.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|If you like to watch movies with alot of blood and gore with a totally tansparent plot then this movie is for you. There is plenty of action and zero suspense. This movie has one twist and no turns. I fell asleep for about 5 minutes about 25 minutes into it; then woke up and finished it just to see how it would end. Dredd's female partner was the only reason I kept watching this very so so action. I should have waited till this thing was available for 1.99 rental fee because it was not worth the other two dollars. I give this move 2 1/2 stars for not dragging me into a full 2 hours of lamenss.
B007SGM084|4.0|I enjoyed this series way more than I was expecting. Although sometimes parts seemed like a repeat over all it was a good read that I had trouble putting down until the end
B004JHY80I|4.0|I didn't expect the story to unravel as it did, and found this to be a different and unpredictable mystery
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so glad to be able to take the Bible literally everywhere I go now!! It makes life a bit easier to know that The word is really there when I need it now instead of  trying to recall certain scriptures and things when I am either sharing Jesus with someone or just needing to connect with Him on a daily basis!! I just wish the app was self-hosted or whatever you call it so that it did not need an Internet or WiFi connection to access it or the Audio portion.... just a suggestion, but I love it!!
B006Z9SP3E|2.0|Disappointed as I enjoyed the first book in the series. Also ends in the middle of an event which should prompt one to read book 3. I won't bother!
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun game not to much sharing and you advance pretty fast and the dragons are very cute and unique.one of the better games of this type.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is one of those search engines that allows for all kinds of research. I can just about find everything I need to continue my research journey.  It's great for research on cooking ideas as well.
0439023483|5.0|Excellent story, and a fantastic introduction into dystopian fiction. I love the conversational writing style; it immediately draws you into the story and makes Katniss & Co seem like old friends.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|This is a fun little game if youre bored and have nothing else to do. However, it really isn't all that exciting and gets old rather quickly.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|It was a quirky interesting movie, we really enjoyed it!  Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt had really good chemistry! Would watch it again!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Best streaming radio app ever.  Better than IHeart, Pandora, and even Jango, my previous favorite.  As a Baby Boomer, I can't stand current music and only listen to the music I grew up with. I love the station selection on XiiaLive Pro. It works great on Kindle Fire.  My fave station is Fun 45's.com. If you were born in the 50's,  you'll love it too. Well worth the price.  No adds, no commercials, no problems at all, just great music.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|The group can  I can honestly say nailed the first one out of the ballpark and is a joy to listen to cover to cover.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game was really fun. I like that you have to unlock the new Mimi games. Fun way to pass the time.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The movie for superhero fans is a must and the scene where hulk punches Thor in the face near the end is hillarious.
B007712XAU|5.0|I just loved the series.  I plan on ordering season 3 if the price is right.  I love British movies.
B0027Z9C2I|5.0|Great musical - fun to watch. Would watch over and over again.  Suitable for children ( mostly)  Beautiful scenery. Enjoy!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cool game it runs all day and night so you don't have to keep watching it to earn money other wise it's a fun game on a kindle fire
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The plot kept me reading, wanting to know more answers. I never would have guessed how it all came together in the end.
B00062PN6I|3.0|The headphones were a little large but the headphone jack adapter was convenient. Also when I turn the volume up it plays out, instead of just in my ears
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can I say, this show is unbelievable!! One of our absolute favorites! Can't wait for all of the future seasons!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I did not like to read but this book made me read like crazy. You should read this book it is awesome!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wow, what an amazing story.  I felt as though I were right there with Katniss, experiencing every shock, both physical and emotional.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Extremely well written; good story.  Loved the character and all the compassion most of the other characters had in the story.  Just a really great read!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to say that this book is insaneeee... It's a very strong adult content. This book is definitely something different from the usual books. I think is a pretty cool book. How ever It did got kind of boring at the middle seems it was repetitive  too much the same stuff with no new details. But after I passed that part I found it very interesting.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This is no Love Actually kind of classic but a fun romantic tale... Slow at times and ewans main character is mildly aspergers so not instantly loveable
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was my first book I purchased on my kindle.  It was an excellent book and I would highly recommend it to anyone to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So much like the Biltmore House in Asheville, NC. Downton Abbey is so much like I envision the Biltmore in the 1920's.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Verychallenging game, must concentrate on the tiles designs.<br />I good do with the popup dating services after each game. Always have to hit the skip button
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Some levels are very easy, but most involve a fairly high level of problem solving skills to complete. Cute graphics and silly sound effects add to the fun. Highly recommended.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was an awesome book. I think it is the best in the series. I sure hope Jeff Kinney  writes another.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|It is well written if you are into the this scene or genre of music. Others might find it a bit over the top and not as enjoyable.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Fun and easy to use.<br />As all excellent choices and can start easy and work up to something harder.<br />I would recommend if you like music.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What a brilliant concept for a book, and for a zombie story no less! I never thought I'd be awarding five stars for a book about zombies.<br /><br />I started this book thinking that it was going to take more of a comedic approach to a zombie thriller. It's written by Max Brooks-son of comedy writer Mel Brooks-who also wrote for Saturday Night Live. The book wasn't funny in any sense of the word, so shame on me for walking into something with a preconceived idea about what to expect.<br /><br />World War Z reads almost like a documentary, since it's essentially a compilation of interviews from all over the world which have been told by the survivors of the war. I know the movie is due out this year, and I just really, really hope that Brad Pitt does the book justice. I hate it when an awesome book is ruined by a terrible movie!<br /><br />Another thing that really impressed me was the sheer amount of creativity that went into putting this book together. I'm pretty sure Max Brooks came up with every possible scenario that could play out in a Zombie Apocalypse. We read accounts of what happened when people first started hearing about the outbreaks of 'African Rabies'; we read about entire governments collapsing, how entire cities were overrun, how the plague went as far as it did without making anyone the wiser, and what militaries around the world had to go through when they realized that all of their training and weaponry meant nothing when they were pitted against a new kind of enemy, one that would never stop coming and would never know fear. How do you fight against 200 million zombies that have taken over the world?<br /><br />I think probably the biggest surprise, though, is the quality of Brooks' writing. I thought it was going to be a simple and easy to digest tale about zombies, but by the time I finished reading World War Z, I have been fervently hoping that it won't be his last.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have a home theater pc connected to a large screen tv through an audio visual receiver.  The PC uses Power DVD 9.  It would not run this movie (even though I have played many recently released movies on this same setup).  I got it to work by upgrading to Power DVD 12 (which is an additional expense).<br /><br />This blu-ray version is absolutely stunning.  It isn't absolutely sharp, but I think that that is simply due to the source material.  The colors are so stunning that it makes me think that it may have been enhanced, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt.  The landscapes and scenes of the characters in the desert are absolutely overwhelming.  I haven't seen this movie in 20 years, and I forgot how good this is.  This version also comes with a \\"making of\\" film which is standard def but is still very interesting.  Interviews with Sharif, O'toole, and Spielberg are nice additions and are worthy of watching.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I have enjoyed chasing the animals.  It is easy to advance through the game.  If you like games that are fun...you will enjoy this one.
1400067820|5.0|I found Anti Fragile to be another very interesting book by Nassim Taleb. I find his books very enlightening and a bit challenging, mostly in a great way.<br /><br /> How is it that there is no good word opposite Fragile on the other side of Resilient? It is hard to believe that such an omission could exist with so many minds and so much effort and success. And yet, there it is. The reason why sometimes the world looks more than a bit compromised when humans are involved.<br /><br />Self interest explains a lot of it. Compromising ethics seems the way of the world and yet those that can rise in that optionality construct to the highest levels sound like the most interested in the best for all of us. Most of the time.<br /><br />Taleb's books bring to mind great questions and this is no exception. Great questions are worth tinkering with and there were many things in my slate to explore. For me, his clear arguments within the sometimes dense probe has great reward. A few very important simple constructs become clear and there is still time to act and re-habitualize.<br /><br />Think you are acting as if you value your own freedom and in line with your own golden rule. Taleb winds up with some pretty easy checks.<br /><br />Clearly it is not a perfect existence and there must be balance against the true needs. But watch out for the quest beyond freedom outside of that.<br /><br />Often Taleb's arguments are so counter to conventional wisdom they can drift one's mind into the wrong take away if not careful. Clearly going away from the crowd just because they are all thinking one way as in the case of betting against a an oil rise just because the impending war is there. But it is an interesting place to look.<br /><br />I would suggest that antifragility is sometimes very conditional. Muscles are antifragile against certain stress, but only some kinds and only if there is food. Working out when you are short of food for exercise purposes might be a good example of that. I don't really know as I have never had that situation.<br /><br />Sometimes things are counter intuitive and common sense is many times and oxymoron. Regardless of anything else, this book, and his [[ASIN:B00824LIPM Fooled By Randomness]] and [[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan]] brings some important truth to brighter light for me.<br /><br />Let boredom be your guide, truth your compass, ethical optionality your friend and antifragility your leverage.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addictive..... I love it and I love the new York style one its awesome .......!!!!!!!!! :) :)
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Bloomberg got it right with this app. Thorough and informative, it is very useful. Uninstalling all other finance apps now.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Classic Tom Clancy. Once it starts building, you can't put it down. Recommend it to all Tom Clancy fans and those that are not.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|We have been thru so many iphones due to the screen smashing! This is a great case but needs to be maintained if it's going to get wet.  Not 100% guaranteed against moisture.  This was a nice price compared to when LifeProof cases 1st came out!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I really enjoy Lee Child's books but this one seemed to drag at times.  I will still keep reading them but wouldn't but this one at the top of the list.
B004P4KMSC|5.0|Bruder is known for their outstanding quality of toys.  Would purchase again. Many, many hours of play time for any little boy.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|1st crouch book I have read and will not be the last.  There were a few verbose passages and sections which dragged a bit but the total result was a novel which was unique and left me wanting more..  not a totally original premise but out there enough to engage my interest and keep it.  Definitely a good read and worth the time
B008TMA1LY|4.0|4 yr old liked it but I got to help her slot a lil difficult to play at her age level...all she wants is to use hello kitty
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This musical is awsome!  My 12 year old watches it quite often.  We've rented it from one of our video stores, but it quit working, so decided to buy it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best series I have  ever read. I would recommend it to teens and tweens looking for an intense and emotional book to pass to time.
B009XTF8KQ|1.0|Wow. I have rarely felt quite so ripped off by a movie. Do not watch. I vehemently do not recommend.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Originally purchased as a gift, but now I'll have to go out and get one for myself. Very good movie.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|I always used to wonder how people coudl sit there an play Angry Birds for what seemed like forever...now I know.  Just to check it out, it was one of the first games I downloaded on my Kindle, then I had to get another.  I'm thinking of getting another.  They are addicting.
B008OOYALE|5.0|U will love this game, but save up your gold. Also save up your money u will need it. Download it!
B0000AOV85|4.0|This was purchased as a birthday gift for my father.  He is a serious Pink Floyd fan.  This was actually on his Christmas wish list, but it ended up a birthday gift instead.  It was something different, and something he enjoyed very much.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game. I am not much of a game player I usually play more mental games like logo quiz or scrabble but coin dozed is fun and addicting
B007R3AZNK|4.0|This was purchased as a gift for Christmas for my father...he was extremely thrilled when he saw it in the box and enjoys everything Joe Bonamassa has put out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great job by Jeff Kinney with this one. It was a great book I recommend that you read the entire series it's worth the time of day from me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was easily the best book I have ever read. I recommend it to everyone. This book should be made into a movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love the sound effects.  I laugh out loud every time I complete a stage and those birds &#34;giggle.&#34;  Fun and fast.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved it.  Watched all three seasons in a week<br />Free Mr. Bates now....<br />Glad Downton has been saved by Mathew
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lots of twists and turns.  Did not end the way I expected which I like as I like to be surprised.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I've always loved crime stories, so this show is right up my alley.  (I also worked in a correctional center as a nurse. for 8 yrs. in the Forensics Unit where I saw many of the horrible murderers that some of deep down secretly wish we had a Dexter roaming around).  Dexter has never failed to entertain me since season one. No, we've never seen him cut up a body, but we see time and time where he makes a cut on his victim's face to have just enough blood to put it a vial and hide behind his air conditioner in his apt.  If you don't know Dexter, I'll give you a very short look into his life.  As a child he witneseses the brutal murder of his own Mother.  The cop who finds him crying in a puddle of his Mom's blood adopts him into his family.  He has a sister.  She later becomes a tough cop and Dexter becomes an expert on blood analysis from murder scenes and works for the same police department.  He's had murderous thoughts since his Mother's death.  When he sees some much of the scum of the earth getting away with murder, he decides to step in and do justice on his own without mercy.  The writer's of this show have done a wonderful job of taking us through a journey of &#34;they got what they deserved&#34;, all the way with us cheering on the likeable murderer.  There are some very serious changes in Dexter's life and that keeps us wanting more and more of Dexter.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|[[ASIN:B004T4LUPW CalenGoo]]It causes my smartphone to crash often and I am not using it anymore.  the software update has not been automatic which I had to manually do the updating myself from time to time.  Updating the software still has not corrected the software crashes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. The graphics are excellent and it allow you to monitor battery life and estimate charging requirements. Its so nice it should have came with the kindle.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|One for me, one as a gift. Really nice music - love it! He has my kind of voice - keeping it!
B0050XFY4O|4.0|This film intrigued me due to its content, setting and controversy.  I found it to be beautifully filmed, the actors were very good and the storyline interesting.  All things considered, I kept wondering how likely this situation would ever be, unless there had been some kind of abuse to sexualize these boys early on.  I also wondered how likely it would be that two brothers could fall in love and move out of the traditional brother-to-brother relationship.  In spite of my doubts, I found myself enjoying the film and wondering how all the dynamics between parents, friends and others - as well as the brothers themselves - would play out and became hopeful for the brother-lovers.  I wasn't disappointed.
1449417051|5.0|But, boohoo - the grab bag receiver did not appreciate it cuz he's not a cat fan. Haha - it is wonderful though!!
B007UUV52K|4.0|Love the variety on this cd. Big fan of Julianne Hough who was great. You&#34;ll love this cd if you enjoy all kinds of music.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|i can't believe this garbage film, there's no message, there's no heroism, and *SPOILER ALERT* fricking autopilot saves the day, lame!
B009YU62H2|5.0|Was sceptical of this album fearing it would be &#34;rolling stonesque&#34; but it is not.  Nice combination of old style with newer vibes and some Chris Cornell solo influences to it.  Must buy for any grunge era rockers!
B003KJF2WE|4.0|I had not seen this movie until after seeing Iron Man 1-2, Captain America and Thor. I saw the The Avengers this weekend and thought I'd better watch this. It was a fun movie and more fun because the volume was turned up loud!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|fantastic game my 3 yr old loves it as well as my 11 yr old sister and my 29 yr old self :). great for any age and I didn't think it was possible but I like this even more than cut the rope! thanks for another reason to stay up way too late!
B008PE9GSA|3.0|They may have changed record labels, but they're still doing the same old song and dance. Although I like the driving rhythms, I am ready for something ne from these artists.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I thought Reacher didn't have too much action.<br />Maybe with the movie, not too much effort was put into it.
B009A87X80|4.0|I wish there were more simple recordings like hers out there. The true artistry of covering a song that was someone else's big hit really shines through here as she turns the songs into something all of her own without changing them at all. It's the purity that is reminscent of what Simon & Garfunkel were able to achieve in their early recordings. Beautiful.

1468179993|5.0|Recently I was asked to develop and present a \\"kick-butt TED-style talk\\" on a topic I'd never spoken on before. The real kicker was that I had five days between being asked and presenting. I'm not a beginner presenter by any stretch and I know how to write and deliver a solid presentation. A TED-syle talk is much different than your usual presi, though. You've got 18 minutes max to make an impact. Making those 18 minutes count requires specific elements and specific techniques. Yes, I could have watched the top 10 TED talks as one reviewer suggested but I didn't have time to do that. Instead, I bought Jeremey's book. Using his outline (shared in other reviews so I won't go into details here), I was able to quickly craft my presentation and had time left over to practice.<br /><br />The result? After I gave my talk, a gentlemen came up to me and said \\"I've listened to a LOT of lunch presentations. And I mean a LOT. The presentation you just gave is hands down the best talk I've ever heard. Your pacing, your delivery, your subject matter was all superb.\\" I also have a meeting scheduled for a huge contract and I booked 3 other speaking gigs before I left the room.<br /><br />Your results may vary, of course, but I know for a fact that what I applied from this book is what made my presentation stand apart.<br /><br />Sarah Robinson<br />[...]

B006ISJQ1W|4.0|This is one of Jonny's greatest acting achievements and it is clear that he knew the main character in the film/book. Happy to add this to my collection.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I love Picoult.  She really lets you know the characters and the emotion.  This was a true to life problem for teens and what they go through. Good ending to the tragedy that was realistic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are intriguing and so well-played that we've begun to care what happens to them. Maggie Smith is amazing as the dowager countess!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I want more. Wish Suzanne would write more. It's one of those books you want to continue like American soap operas.

B004EPZ034|4.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults alike. The music is very Chipmunk and FUN. We're happy to watch this one over and over.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I know this book was on many &#34;best of&#34; lists last year, but I didn't have huge expectations for it.  I found that I actually had to put it down at one point and walk away because I felt like I was rushing through it too fast and it was so special that I wanted the experience to last.  It's a young adult book, but it thoroughly captivated this mid-30s woman!
B009VB97EY|2.0|The plot is pretty terrible, but let's face it...I'm watching this for the 20 minutes that Channing Tatum dances half naked.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Margaret Thatcher is a very interesting lady and her life is amazing.  I don't mind movies that do flashbacks, but this one goes back-and-forth so much that a few times I wasn't sure where we were on the timeline.  Confusing method of telling a great story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story! Great cast. Great writing.  If you enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, you will also love season 3.  Can't wait for the rest!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This book should be required reading in all schools from elementary to universities. I am looking forward to seeing the forthcoming movie.

071815780X|5.0|Love the show. Love the book.<br />Highly recommend. Not so much for the &#34;quick&#34; part but for the fresh and serve ideas.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I liked this much darker version of Snow White.  I must say it had me thinking about the story at the end.  I was hesitant to view this one after reading a ton of reviews about how bad the acting was.  I didn't think it was bad.  The special effects were good and it was an ok movie to view.  Not blockbuster but worth watching when you have the time.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|What is there not to love about Dexter? This season was excellent and we are waiting so we can but season 7.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|It's Dr Seuss and its a spin off his book.  Has a good environmental story and is fun to watch with the family.
B000SEFCD8|4.0|An interesting read but I felt excessive focus on primates rather than humans...who are on the other end of the leash. Would like to have enjoyed  more coverage of sporting dogs rather than house pets and herding dogs.
B004R1Q296|5.0|An incredibly, rich and educational historical drama.  A must read for every history buff.  I read this novel years ago, it's the type of novel to read over and over throughout the years.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The book is an amazing thrilling book.There are so many many thrills. It is so good I would read it \\"forever\\"

0525478817|5.0|I read this book after seeing a lot about it in magazines and procuring a signed copy from Walmart. It was a fantastic story. I am a teenager and, from my perspective, everything written was very realistically from a teenagers perspective. All of the profound thoughts were simple and grounded. It made me cry! It is the type of book that I would share with my Augustus.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great way to spend my time. I absolutely love this series. I highly recommend it to anyone. A glimpse into the third series.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Until I purchased this copy of Dune in the Blu-Ray format, I had never watched it all the way through. I was definately impressed. The fact that it is now available in Blu-Ray makes it a whole new experience. A must see!

B004QX07G4|3.0|Her book is just as funny as her show. Some parts dragged a little but for the most part it was funny and it made you think but in a good way. Good vacation for the mind.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK!! It is such an easy read on the kindle fire HD! An amazing story line, great characters, plot twists. Plus the adventures don't have to stop, read the continuing series with pretties, specials and extras. Love, Love Love Uglies. :)

B007EECSFA|5.0|I have loved all of Kate's books but I have to say this one was my favorite. I'm now somewhat bummed that I have to wait who knows how long to read more from her.  I don't want to say too much as I think the best part of Kate's books are getting lost in the different historical time periods and deep characters.  Love love loved it and I wish I wasn't finished with it yet!
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Mark Cuban seems like a blue collar guy that worked his ass off and hit it big. His book reflects his experiences. I get the feeling that he meets a lot of &#34;empty suits&#34; with Harvard MBAs but no drive and hunger.<br /><br />So if you are a blue collar guy this is the type of advice you need to hear.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I've been following Jonathan and Charlotte since their auditions on Britains Got Talent.  Their singing in this album is stunningly beautiful and powerful.  I hope they have a lot of success together and that their friendship stays strong through the years.
B008NW67E0|5.0|It does not surprise me that Mumford & Sons made a splash for themselves in album sales with this offering. I look forward to more from them, and soon. I didn't know the banjo could sound this awesome!
B0050ZPU6E|5.0|I don't know how I've managed to go this long without buying this album...despite the fact that I've long admired Cloudbusting on it's own. Although my tastes have run more toward the 70's than 80's, I was somewhat aware this was regarded as a landmark 80's album and the day recently came that I decided to rectify my oversight. I couldn't find anybody recommending the US CD for its sound quality so I took a risk with the Japanese import - an expensive risk, at that. Turns out it was worth every penny, as the sound with it on my hifi rig is exquisite enough to leave me little if any doubt as to its mastering and the pressing itself, not to mention the magnificent engineering of the immersive soundscapes found within, and that are, this album. But, my first formal intro to the disc was just sitting between the speakers with the lyric booklet in hand and finding countless times, over and over, just how profoundly I felt rewarded for paying close attention to this disc's presentation and its central theme of a drowning woman, whether real or in a dream. The album is filled with poetry and the poetic and is a mesmerizing work of art. If you've been...uh...hounded by not being able to find a good sounding copy, then look no further than this edition. Expensive, yes, but way worth it for an album like this. Highly recommended!

B004EIZCPM|3.0|I had high hopes for this, as I like Emma Stone and I like good high-school comedies, usually.  But it was not really what I expected, not as funny as I anticipated, and kinda just...cold.  Not in the good 'dark comedy' way, either.  Something was missing.  But whatever, it was OK.

B00A9X9TIW|2.0|With the quality of the actors in this movie, as well as the action packed trailers, I was sorely disappointed in this movie.  This movie had so much potential, yet it failed to deliver.  Why?  The acting was good, but the plot was dismal. I found myself several times wondering what was going on, and why?  There is no value in this movie.  Some day in the future, the actors will look back on this film and ask themselves, &#34;did I need the money that bad?&#34;.

B009AMANBA|5.0|One of the best movies of recent years, certainly when it comes to historical events and performance. Daniel Day-Lewis is pitch-perfect as Mr. Lincoln. The plot is often raw with emotions in unexpected ways, and yet subtle in the ways that matter. There are some historical inaccuracies, I imagine done as usual, for dramatic effect, but all-in-all, a brilliantly done job by the leading actors and a wonderful supporting cast. Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field give Oscar-worthy performances against one another. Spielberg did a great job, but it is not the best as cinematography. There are several Oscars that will be won from this movie, and I, for one, cannot wait to own a copy of this wonderful film. The ending was done with pathos and respect, and the last scene with Mr. Lincoln is heart-wretching in its simplicity and effect. Lincoln as a warm and compassionate man that will do all he can to make certain that the 13th Amendment becomes law and it is nothing less than I would expect from him. Shows his humor and his patience and understanding of what he was trying to accomplish. As a history-buff, and hopefully, a future professor, an extremely worthy film about an amazing man that left us too soon.

0446554995|3.0|This was definitely one of the more sour tasting Pendergast novels. The novel started up nicely enough but tapered off quickly. I had several upsets along the way. Some of the wording in the book was very repetitive, not just used often but used close together as well. For example - As he dove under the water the propeller missed his head by inches. He breached the surface and a gunshot rang out missing his head by inches.<br /><br />There were a lot of missed by mere inch moments. I feel overall revelations in this book jump the shark, perhaps even a few times. Also, if the Dr. Felder and Corrie Swanson side stories were deleted altogether, this book in the series would be quite short. Those little jumps in the story were extremely boring to me, and provided absolutely no forward movement for the plot. If they are going to be expounded upon in subsequent novels, the authors should have just put those elements into the next one.<br /><br />I usually enjoy finishing a Pendergast novel and comparing notes with my sister. Discussing which parts I enjoyed, which parts I had unanswered questions on, and we deliberate our hypotheses. With this one now concluded and I look back on it, there really wasn't too much to really enjoy compared to earlier works.<br /><br />One statement that stuck out like a ugly, grotesque thumb, was when D'gosta was looking into this serial killer, and he says to himself in an inner monologue, how that he and Pendergast had worked on several cases in the past, but this one was the most strange. When that line came out, I had my own inner monologue that went something like this:<br /><br />Wait, hold up. Seriously the strangest. Some douchebag serial killer is murdering people and leaving body parts at the crime scene and a message. That is weird, but remember that case where something was killing people and removing their brains and taking a large bite out of it. Or when some guy was stalking people and removing sections of their spines and creating some bizarre formula to slow the aging process. Or when there was the possibility of zombies roaming the streets of N.Y. Or even stranger still people being murdered by a possible demon.<br /><br />Now those cases were strange, but this little serial killer didn't seem very interesting at all, and even less interesting was who the serial killer turns out to be. That individual would be the flying leap over the shark I mentioned. Furthermore, I just don't think the concept of the whole Nazis being involved grasped me. I'm hoping they fix their formula for the next Pendergast novel and give us another top notch stand alone. Overall, the wait for this newest edition seemed very anti-climatic.ating some bizarre formula to slow the aging process. Or when there was the possibility of zombies roaming the streets of N.Y.

B005LAIGZU|4.0|I've seen this movie three times now and have enjoyed it each time I've watched it. It's important to note that although following a real group of Seals - although it's created with the fictional plot, the events - to an extent - are everyday reenactments. Picture the civil war reactors meets modern day Hollywood.<br /><br />I'm going to start off with why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The plot. Like I said, it's fictional and Hollywood. The Seals have to stop a terrorist from getting tech into the country that can bypass all safety measures we have in place. I didn't research the tech, but it sounded real enough. The problem with the plot is the typical Hollywood style, thin and rushed with no real context, no fault to the &#34;actors&#34; and director.<br /><br />The rest is amazing. The visuals are spectacular and look amazing on blu-ray. The action sequences are breathtaking. The first time I watched it, I literally had a few holy cow moments! You really get a glimpse of the teamwork and effort that goes into each mission. They really do give a glimpse to the out of combat happenings, which for a war movie deserves props. It doesn't romanticize. There are some gory moments, but not terrible - certainly not as bad as most modern war movies.<br /><br />I would highly recommend at least renting, if not buying this movie. I didn't find this movie to be political or propaganda. I lean heavy to one side of the political spectrum and I never felt like Hollywood was trying to push a message - which is what I like. I watched it to be entertained, and I wasn't let down. Worth it!

1572814748|5.0|I like these because of their size, because of their vibrant colors, and because, like other Rider-Waite decks, there are pictures on all of the cards, including the minor arcana.  This is a great help when I'm doing a reading.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was entirely unlike any young adult reader I have ever read. Very violent, but not in a way that would be too awfully inappropriate for the young reader. I personally would not allow my child to read this series unless they were at least 15 or older.....or a very mature 12. Some very adult scenarios these children face, children killing children. All in all, a very good series, and I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

0765325950|3.0|I started reading this series when Robert Jordan began writing it.  And I have also read most of what Brian Sanderson has published.<br /><br />I wish Robert had lived to finish it.<br /><br />I enoyed most of the first 800 pages or so of this finale, despite some of the incongruity from previous books, and how the characters I had grown to love became so shallow.<br /><br />But more than anything about this particular book was the feeling that the climax was less than satisfying, and the denouement was terrible.  Robert had stated that if the final book was 6,000 pages, he would finish it.  Brian, and Robert's widow, went for the \\"split it into 3 books and make more money\\" version.  And yet after all that, toward the end, it felt so rushed, as if they were on a page count.<br /><br />Very disappointing.<br /><br />But I gave it 3 stars just because Sanderson is a good writer, the action was intense, and we learned something about the ending of these characters after 23 years.  I only hope that they don't spoil it further by trying to complete Robert's \\"trilogy prequel\\" that he started before he got sick, or by following up after \\"This is the End of The Wheel of Time\\" with a \\"This is the start of The Wheel of Fortune\\" or some other nonsense to keep the money train going.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|Good report on how habits control our lives or how we can control our lives through habits. It was a little heavy on how habits control us and a little light on how we can control them, however the author did give a brief framework to the end of the book to use to discover our habits and change them.

1607066017|3.0|I was hoping for something more original. Something like \\"Chew.\\" I was hoping for something more gritty. Something like \\"Game of Thrones.\\" (yes, the books). What I got was a mediocre story with decent artwork. I was really ready to like this. Maybe my expectations were too high. But sticking bat wings, horns and a computer monitor on generic characters is not enough to get me to stand up an applaud.

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Looks great. I liked the on/of switch. Audio clarity and quality is good. Production qulaity is good for this product.  I can't give it higher than one stars however, because it just can't do it's job. If I placed this mike anywhere but directly in front of my lips, I couldn't get enough gain out of it to make a sound through the amplifier. I don't have this problem with any of my other microphones. I changed the bettery with a new one, but no help.  It's also not omni-directional in any sense of the word. You have to speak directly into it to have any audio.

B007Z8ZKS2|2.0|I have no major complaints with this book.  It just didn't grab my interest very well.  Its based on a group of teenage cancer sufferers so you know they are going to die from the start, its just a question of who will die first.  There was also a love affair between two of them.  So it was sad and I did shed a few tears despite my best efforts but I can't recommend it unless you are 13.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|After watching this movie for the second time, nearly 10 years after watching it for the first time, I realized how absolutely hilarious it is.  I am typically not a fan of Will Ferrell or Ben Stiller, but this movie is wonderful.  I watched it 3 times in a month after purchasing it on Amazon.<br />PS-If you are an Alex Skarsgard fan, you will not believe how much he has changed and beefed up since his bit part in this movie as a moronic, stick skinny, male model who dies in a &#34;freak gasoline fight accident.&#34; Now he is a hot, muscular, badboy Vampire in True Blood.  Who would have thought?!?!
B0030LYL88|5.0|To paraphrase my other review \\"The female vocalist has an excellent, powerful voice, the band is extremely talented, and the orchestral arrangements are truly classical and very well done.\\"<br /><br />They are also very good live. The singer sounds the same (good and powerful), which means a lot to me. The keyboard, drummer and guitar players are all top notch, and the bass player is one of the best I have seen and heard of late.<br /><br />As manny know, this style of music has its own formula requirements. It's not normally for me but I can get through that for the vast amount of great music this group puts out.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This app is full of fun tasks. It really is a mind challenge game. Looking for the hidden objects is a lot of fun. The game cab get confusing at times with the goals that are impossible to achieve without spending money.
B005OF7ZQ8|5.0|I really have grown to like this band. I did have to endure some of the rather less artistic pleasantness. Some speed metal (too much fast beat and double bass) is prevalent, and a bit of growl in some songs. It's part of this genre, but the good far outweighs any of that.<br /><br />The female vocalist has an excellent, powerful voice, the band is extremely talented, and the orchestral arrangements are truly classical and well done. If you like your music mixed with some heavy rock, and a heavy dose of drama and classical overtone this group does it well.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this album. I think that besides A Minor, this is my favorite A. Keys album. Listen to your heart and Brand new me are my favorites. I own all of her albums and can listen to every one the whole way through
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very romantice, inspirational book.  I couldn't put it down.  I found myself rooting for everyone involved.  A must get book!
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I'm hooked. Story plot is exciting, interesting characters. Intriguing ways to survive and be killed. I'm always at the edge of my seat.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I first stumbled upon this game when it launched on iOS and immediately was hooked.  It's simple, yet challenging.  Don't play it if you have work to do however; you won't get any of it done.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I just got this and I'm amazed!!! I'm running an Intel i5 2500k, before temps with a few browser windows open and regular browsing used to be at 45-55C, now they're at 30-35C. Games don't reach 60. Great job CM
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I found this film to be very well done and very addictive in its story. Rooney Mara and Daniel Craigs' performances were phenomenal and should not be missed! You will never take your eyes off the screen. I personally don't know why everyone here on Amazon has given it such a average rating when it is way above average! One thing I do have to say to better enjoy this movie you really have to listen to all the dialog, otherwise you will miss whats going on in this film. If you do this you will have no problem in enjoying this amazing film!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I came upon True Blood one day while I was browsing the TV channels for something to watch. I watched the first episode for a few minutes and thought to myself \\"this is really weird\\" but I gave it a chance and the more I watched, the more I got into it. Eventually I did some research on the show - found out it was based on a book series, what days and times it came on. From the first episode on I was addicted. I watched as much as I could on HBO and decided that I would by the DVD. I also bought the books as well (which are VERY good!)<br />As much as I hate the fact that they have changed a lot from the books, I still think they did a great job and I love the series. I no longer can afford HBO so I wait until each season is released on DVD. I can't wait to see what happens next!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is awesome finally a free app that's actually good!I'm happy with it and would totally reccomend it.That's all folks!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie is so sweet. It focuses on the love between Albert and Victoria in such a tender way - especially their letter writing.
0547258305|5.0|Got this for my brother who is not a book lover though I'm sure he reads more than a lot of kids. He basically needs things to have a lot of action and be very clear about what is going on so he can follow it. He liked this and requested the sequels. I thought the romance element might be a turn off for him, but he said that since the main character is sort of invincible due to her special powers, the romance was the only thing that sort of made her human, so he thought it worked.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is super cute. It has awesome graphics and can be addicting. I don't know why I waited to get this game. It's a good game and its free.
0786838655|5.0|Little brother read these in middle school and early high school. He's not a bookworm - needs lot of action, can't skim, sometimes confused when it's not 100% clear what's going on - and these did it for him. Now that he's 16 he thinks they're not really that good but reads them for tradition's sake.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I began my career in aerospace and defense just a couple of years prior to Mr. Clancy' s publication of Clear and Present Danger. He frightened the industry, and the US Congress with his knowledge of inner circles, technology, and his visionary writing. More than a few code-name government programs were renamed after C&PD.<br /><br />I have read all of his works of \\"fiction\\", and they all intrigue and frighten. Let's just hope they are read with interest by our own intelligence services - I'm sure they are read by those of our enemies.<br /><br />Threat Vector should be required reading.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|{my thoughts} - This book is about a young girl named {linh cinder}. She is a {cyborg/human}. She has feelings and thoughts just like humans do however she is classified as being less then human as being nothing but someone else's property. She has a run in with {prince kai} and he and her begin to get to know each other. Eventually he gets up the nerve to ask her out on a date. However, she doesn't tell him she is a {cyborg}. The book goes through her trial and error of trying to accept herself, of wanting him to understand and accept her for who she is and of wanting to run away and forget about everything she has ever known. She has a lot of spunk, a lot of determination and can be rather emotional. It's a really nice book that is well written with a different take on the whole {cinderella fairy-tale stories}. If you enjoy reading different takes on {fairy-tales} then I am certain you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />{reason for reading} - I like reading the different takes individuals have on {fairy-tales} so this book seemed Ideal for me. I really enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading the next one in the series.
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|Correctly portrays what it would be like to survive in the wilderness.  Hopkins and Baldwin give gritty, realistic performances in something of a cult classic.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My first experience with the Reacher series and it's started an avalanche.  Don't start at bedtime or you'll miss a lot of sleep.Great reading keeps your attention.
B004RC8NXI|5.0|Perfect for the Natalie Portman fan. A funny and light-hearted movie this is a slice of life movie portrayed by two popular actors.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Reminds me of an ant hill with blind devotion to the collective. Nobody ask the question or gives an opinion without the possibility of dire consequences. A very well constructive narrative and characters who finally have the courage to be individualistic and have some personal incentive to question the decision makers. This was a heads up when you relinquish the day to day way of life to bureaucracy. The\\"Wool\\" no pun intended gets pulled over your eyes and fear is the equation for governing. Very enlightening and disturbing read, a story for everyone.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Perfect for the Natalie Portman fan. Dark and brooding, this film tells the story of a ballerina who is too obsessed with perfection.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|At first I was a bit apprehensive about renting this movie but after a couple of minutes I knew I made the right decision.  It was a very funny movie and not in the lame, girl power type of movies that have been coming out, it was genuinely witty and fun.  I recommend it if you are in the mood to laugh out loud and see some good singing and choreography work!
B008VSKPJO|1.0|I thoroughly enjoy Ms May's music, however, I am more than a little put out by this most recent release.  The first 14 sougs are a repeat of her second album, followed with a repeat from her first album.  These are not even a varied rendition of the original recordings - they sound the same as the previous albums.  A whole FIVE songs that weren't performed on either of her first two albums.  Waste of time and money.
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena was about demigods trying to fulfill the prophecy of the seven and close the doors of death. The seven demigods were trying to stop the giants from awakening the earth goddess Gaea. Two of the demigods, Percy, Jason,and the roman god Bacchus fought and killed two giants that had trapped their friend, Nico. One of the seven demigods goes on her own quest to follow the Mark of Athena and find the Athena Parthenos, the most famous Greek statue of all time. After she finds it her and Percy fall into Tartarus trying to get the statue out from the ground to use it to help defeat the giants so they can't awaken Gaea. Most of the story takes place in Rome and New Rome, where roman demigods are trained.
B004XWLN20|2.0|this item was shipped to my PO Box and the box arrived open. Upon further review of the gift, the outside of the series case was damaged and a few of the dvd would skip upon playing. For the price of $150, I would not reccommend this item to others. It was a christmas gift for my wife and she would like to exchange it if possible.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I should have read other reviews before ordering this product.  Many of the BRAND NEW discs skipped, got stuck or did not play at all.  By the third season it was no longer one or two episodes, but almost an entire disc that was unplayable.  Very disappointed. I returned this product.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Really great app. The only thing I wish they would do is take out the 'Posted by eBay Mobile'. Especially when we're just relisting items.<br /><br />Must have if your an avid eBay buyer or seller
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />\\"Sinister\\" starts out pretty much like every other haunted house film made in the last 20 years, & believe me, there was more haunted house films made, than dead people! Well, maybe that's a hair of a overstatement, but it sure seems that way. This film could be construed as \\"The Amityville Horror\\" influenced school of haunted housed movies, but it definitely graduated near the top of it's class.<br /><br />So here we have another film in this overused & abused horror sub-genre, ho hum. Then you start to get into the movie a little more & it has a few neat little twists, as Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), the father of a young family moves into a house that nobody wants. Ok, that sounds familiar? But, the town does not want Ethan Hawke, as he is an investigative journalist/novelist that writes about true murder cases of people. His biggest success, is where he actually cracked the case of a murder, making the cops look inept, which most of them did not take to kindly to, including the head cop of the new town he moved to, telling him he should pack up & leave.<br /><br />Ellison told his wife he was writing a new book, but didn't tell her the whole truth. As the house they moved into was the scene of four family members murdered, & a fifth member, a little girl is missing. Ellison is using this house to write a new book, one that will save his career, at least he thinks...then he finds an 8mm film of the family members being murdered, each one singularly, in a different manner, but not only the family from the house, but others too! A dark shadowy figure appears in these films. After watching this, strange things begin to happen to the whole family. The children have imaginary playmates. The shadowy figure appears in glimpse, & the corner of Ellison's eyes. It has an agenda, it wants the children!<br /><br />\\"Sinister\\" is a film that will crawl under your skin, moving around, making you just intrigued & uncomfortable enough to keep watching, as a feeling of impending doom starts to arise from the plot. It most definitely has a sublime creepiness that grows more potent as Ellison begins to become aware of the danger to his family, & himself, made all the more potent by fine direction, acting, & a deliberate pace of new secrets being opened up, as the lid of doom inches ever closer to shutting on the family. You are glued to the screen wondering what will transpire next, even if you think you know, there are a few good twists, that reveal their selves, in a very potent ending, that you soon won't forget!<br /><br />Take the time to check this one out. It's, well, creepy.g, as a feeling of impending doom starts to arise from the plot.

B004H4XLRE|5.0|I was so pleased on receiving it in the mail. The toy came in excellent condtiion and delivery was fast! My son saw this race  launcher video demo on Youtube and kept asking for it for Christmas. I couldn't find this toy in stores i.e.,Target and Toys R Us so I was happy to find it on Amazon. My 3 year old loves this toy and plays with it all the time!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I was looking to build a new computer, and wasn't looking to spend a lot of money, so I was looking at the Intel i5 series. This one was great. It isn't as expensive as the 3570 or other upper models that some people use, and it had more power than the 2nd Generation i7's. It was a good inbetween.
B0058YPL66|5.0|DVD set arrived in excellent condition and delivery was fast! I love this show so I knew I had to buy the first season. The price was reasonable and lower than in the stores like Target. Glad I bought it on Amazon.
0563362499|5.0|like to cook from it many times, got this as a christmas gift. The book arrived quickly. Very good book
B005OCFGTO|4.0|This DVD set is the best set money could buy for Harry Potter. It even helped me with a project for a college course.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I am loving this site for home and on lunch. The selection is everything from Jazz to hip hop to Country and you can listen all day long and change up as much as you like. You can listen to the music or catch the video for more entertainment.<br />I'm loving it!<br />T.R. Mac.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I've heard a lot of these guys, but this is the best album of them.<br />It has everything and every song is unique in its own way.<br />I started listening to Red Hot Chilli Pepers back in 2000 when they debuted this album.<br />It's a must have for 2000s collection.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|It's just disturbing and weird, and not the unique form of artistic film I was hoping for when I sat down.
B0044XRIMW|3.0|This is the first and possibly last video I will buy from Amazon for online viewing. I have tried a couple of times to view it over my broadband network and it gets hung up with Amazon trying to reconnect. Move is great, but Amazon gets a D for providing it to us.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Great new take on a classic. Keeps you coming back for more. Captivating, fun, and engaging. Well worth a watch!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is great! the graphics are really good and there is a good amount of action and adventure to keep me interested. well done!
B000003TAB|5.0|this is an album full with rarities and good songs, i enjoy it to much, and i need it to replace the old one that i lost with this
B00004ZELJ|1.0|Choreography was very disappointing.  Backstreet boys were wandering on stage like headless chickens.  One of the worst DVD on the market.  If you want to see how a concert is done, I highly recommend N'Sync live at the madison square garden...Lets put it this way I threw a tomato at the TV!!
B005KELQEU|4.0|I ordered this case last week. It arrived in less than a week just using standard shipping. I have the latest generation (basic) Kindle. It fits perfectly. I also purchased a Silicone Skin. With the skin, the case is a little snug but still fits. I was looking for something plain and basic. I throw my Kindle in my purse, so this will protect it from scratches and small spills. It feels more like f aux leather, but it does it's job. I'm always on the go and this was just what I was looking for. Great price point, fast shipping, decent quality.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|One of my fav cds to listen to. Bought it twice after I loaned out my original. The slowed down versions of Sam's Town and Romeo and Juliet are dreamy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun fun fun to play. however sometimes slow to load and somethings you cant do without friends or buying things or logging into facebook or twitter. you can gain friends through the game so that helps but I do not like the sharing what if you have no facebook or twitter. and then it requests access to your info on facebook. see no reason fir that either. so I like playing a lot but am limited in my options to level up and gain energy
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Great classic movie, Arrived fast and in perfect shape. Glad I got to share it with my son for Christmas. He loved it.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|This move was just about exactly as stupid as you think it will be based on the premise.  Go take a 2 hour nap instead - this isn't worth the time it takes to sit through it.
0802473164|1.0|Not really getting much from it other than the dr phil talk. It is ok but not the life changing book i had heard it to be.
B007WULJ5G|3.0|This is by far the craziest and most disgusting movie I have ever watched. It is so disturbing and I dont know how any could direct such a thing. If you are looking for most deranged movie ever made this is it
B000P0J09W|5.0|Love this movie, arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Have already watched it several times with my son. thanks again
B005ILWOZA|4.0|Though not a fan of all the tracks on this album,just had to buy it just for the hit track itself .......
B0001I562I|5.0|The dvd arrived quickly and in great shape. i love this classic movie so was happy to share it with my son for Christmas.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I can play for hours! If you like puzzles you will enjoy this.  It's challenging and addicting. Highly recommend this app!
B003L77G8I|5.0|everything was good. we got the dvd very quickly and it was just what my daughter had wanted.  brand new just like description said
0061733199|5.0|bought this as a christmas gift for someone on their wishlist, hopefull they enjoy it. it seems like something i would read so i know they would too.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next & the next! Found myself pulling for eva & Gideon to work it all out!
B000641Z90|5.0|Phil Collins has more talent in one fingernail than most artists out now. This concert looks and sounds awesome from very beginning to very end. Plus they kept showing this girl in the audience crying and, ya know, that would get me started. Has all the official music videos and other extras too. The only wierd thing is, I ordered one copy for me and one for my mom and neither one of them pause. You can rewind and fast forward but cant pause. I dont get it but its still a great part of my collection.
1455502626|5.0|First in the John Corey suspense series revolving around a cop in New York City convalescing from bullet wounds. Although, the story actually takes place in Long Island.<br /><br />My Take<br />Oh my god. I swear, if you look up \\"snark\\" in the dictionary, you'll find John Corey's picture. He is so incredibly funny as the sarcasm just falls right out of his mouth.<br /><br />Early on, John visits the murder scene (as a consultant for the cops), and the homicide detective in charge is annoyed at what appears to be some lookie-loo on her scene:<br /><br />\\"Excuse me.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're excused.\\"<br /><br />\\"Excuse me, are you supposed to be here?\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm here with the band.\\"<br /><br />And it just keeps gettin' better!<br /><br />I am curious how the pay offer falls from $100 a day to a week to $1 a day.<br /><br />It's powerplays, subterfuge, history, and plain old detective work that solves this one. An excellent example of keeping one's mind open. Sadly, it's also an endorsement for sticking to the rules, sigh.<br /><br />It's also a lesson in changing your locks!<br /><br />I enjoyed the bit of piratical history for the area. I also enjoyed Corey's idea of a morning-after gift... Who knew guys did stuff like that?<br /><br />The Story<br />While convalescing at his Uncle Harry's 1890s Victorian farmhouse, friends are murdered, and Max wants Corey to be his backup since he's the one with the homicide experience and Max isn't.<br /><br />It's not something Corey wants to be involved in. Partly because he's on the disabled list and isn't supposed to be doing policework, and partly because he doesn't want to be involved with the FBI or the CIA.<br /><br />But the Nashes are friends. And Corey can't resist sticking his nose in, especially when it means he can pull the noses of the FBI and CIA as they try to cover things up!<br /><br />The Characters<br />John Corey is a NYC homicide detective convalescing from gunshot wounds incurred in the line of duty. He \\"thinks the government should allocate one thousand silent 'e's' to New England and Long Island, and when they're used up, no one can have any more.\\" It doesn't take much to make him horny. Dominic Fanelli is his partner in NYC. Detective Lieutenant Andrew Wolfe is Corey's unhappy boss. Jim and Lynne are his siblings. Robin Paine is his ex-wife.<br /><br />Sylvester \\"Max\\" Maxwell is the police chief of the Southold Town Police Department. Corey reckons he always looks out for number one. Detective Elizabeth Penrose is with Suffolk County homicide and in charge of the investigation. George Foster is FBI; Ted Nash is Department of Agriculture, a.k.a., CIA.<br /><br />Plum Island personnel<br />Paul Stevens is the security chief with a stick up his...ahem; Kenneth Gibbs is his assistant. Dr. Karl Zollner is in charge of the labs; Donna Alba is his assistant. Dr. Chen is a colleague of the Gordons, and she spouts the party line.<br /><br />Tom and Judy Gordon are biological research scientists exploring Ebola at Plum Island. They're imports from the Midwest and have really dug themselves into the island life from their Formula 303 boat to cultivating a friendship with a local vineyard owner, Fredric Tobin, who can't seem to remember how friendly he was with the Gordons. Margaret Wiley sold them an acre of useless land. Edgar Murphy and his wife, Agnes, are the Gordons' neighbors. Emma Whitestone is the president of the Peconic Historical Society.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is very pretty with the night sky and the flashing yellow light of the Plum Island lighthouse.<br /><br />The title is apropos as the Gordons' work---both pleasure and scientific---takes place on Plum Island.hinks the government should allocate one thousand silent 'e's' to New England and Long Island, and when they're used up, no one can have any more.\\" It doesn't take much to make him horny.

3551354014|5.0|This was a great book. For a native German-speaker it presented no challenges but was delightful to read, as it gave plenty of current German slang and kids' expressions, while completely preserving the content and tone of the English original. Toll war das!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|If you are a Beatle fan or a Harrison fan, or were alive the last 50 years this is definitely worth watching.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This next installment in the series is very good.  It progresses at a quicker pace at the characters develop nicely.  I learned more about the time period and enjoyed the book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Digitalchemy,  you are brilliant in your focus on your target customer!  You gave us a simple calculator that is so easy to use that we the people reach for it time after time.  Thank you for allowing me to have one less device to keep track of.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I've ever read.... I can even express how much I enjoyed it. It's nothing like any book and keeps you wrapped up in it all the way through. The love and passion and heartache in this book is so real it makes you feel like you are standing in the middle of it. Just a warning to those that are as sappy as me. You will laugh, you will cry, you will get angry, and you will live in the joy. This book is an emotional rollercoaster!!! Highly recommend!!!!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Great game for kids, too easy for adults. However, still fun. Beat most of the levels in the first try with some seriously crazy bounces, because I know how physics works.<br /><br />Teaches very basic physics.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I had loved The Pillars of the Earth as a book and as a movie and therefore wanted to read the sequel.<br />Sometimes I find the graphic written descriptions of sexual intercourse over done.  the movie seems to be more discreet-----As the book progresses and the story evolves,  happily Mr. Folletts need to write such graphic descriptions seems to be less.  It is as if he has to cater up to one section of his clientele especially in the beginning of the book------
B0090YHSFC|3.0|it is a relatively simple game. Good for kids, maybe. Does not work well on phones.<br /><br />Not my type of game.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|For my 5 year old nephew on Christmas. I'm pretty sure he was most excited a out this gift then all the others :)
B000HF6XV8|2.0|It felt like the film did not have sufficient time to develope the relationships which are at the core of the book.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|all you walking dead fans need to own the seasons.  such a great way to spend a super cold weekend when there is no work.  ZOMBIE MARATHON
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I enjoyed looper and think Joseph Gordon Levitt did a great job in playing a young Bruce Willis.  Bruce Willis, on the other hand, just played an old Bruce Willis; nothing special there. Good to see jeff Daniels in a serious role because he's good at them.<br /><br />Overall, 7 out of 10.  There are slow parts that, while not unbearable, tended to lose my interest
B005LAJ23A|5.0|must have for any walking dead fan.  no better way to spend a super cold weekend of no work.  ZOMBIE MARATHON
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I didn't grow up as a fan of the transformers as many did, but the movies definitely made me realize I missed out on a great thing!
B008602KQI|5.0|at first I was hesitant to watch it but it has turned out to be a favorite movie of mine !!
B000F8O35U|3.0|I loved this movie as a child and hoped to pass the enjoyment on to a family member, however the copy of the movie i was sent was unusable. My refund went through in a timely manner, however I'd have been happier with an undamaged movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors, I have yet to read a book by him that I did not like. I highly recommend this book if you are into love stories. The story is somewhat similar to the movie &#34;Enough&#34; stared by Jennifer Lopez.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It is hard to describe this book because it is so unique. The hundred year old man leads us on adventures past and present. Through absurd situations that somehow become normal. I laughed out loud several times. I also cared about what happened to this group of lovable scroundrals. I great look at life and how we relate to each other.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is quick and easy with no learning curve required.  We just pass it around. It is just a lot of fun for everyone.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|This movie is great for the lesbian woman who is trying to find herself, ealizing that sometimes you can't help who you fall in love with or who you want to be with, its all about being true to yourself
B006S08RLU|5.0|Definitely one of my favorites! There are so many elements to analyze. I'm actually excited to write my paper on this film. RECOMMENDED TEN-FOLD!!
0345803507|5.0|The third book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy takes you into married life of Christian and Ana and how they grow together over the years.
0395389496|4.0|It's a rather obscure story relating to Santa.  Before the movie came out I'd never heard of this book.  But the little boys seem to like it (mainly because they love trains and Santa).  I don't really think I'd buy it for them if they didn't like trains.  It comes with a audiobook on CD read by Liam Neeson.  That's a nice feature for playing in the car on a road trip at Christmas time.<br /><br />If you have kids that love Christmas and trains, buy the book.  Otherwise, move on.  Don't expect the movie to be the same.  The movie is vastly different.  So don't buy this and compare the two.  It won't work.
0345803485|5.0|The first book introduces you into the lives of Christian and Anastasia and some background on there life and an introduction to there relationship.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book has a subtle message. It is an easy read but also gives you cause for reflection on some of the ills of society
0345803493|5.0|The second book in the Fifty Shades trilogy takes you more in depth into the relationship of Christian and Ana.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you like period dramas, British dramas, stories of aristocrats and servants, rich vs poor, romance, intrigue, scandal (not too much scandal but just enough), nice characters with some selfish ones thrown in, lavish back drops and exquisite historical costumes and settings, this is the show for you.  I absolutely love it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This free app work's very good; perfect for basic needs. If you need something more complicate that basic math try a scientific calculator.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Omg! No word  that  was amazing.it was perfectly worded and it was sad and hilarious an  perfect.<br />I wa  awesome
0345803493|5.0|The book is of very good quality, no folds, no rips, no notes, nothing. It arrived earlier than predicted so all in all I was very pleased with it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book it has a very surprising cliffhanger at the end but I loved it.  My favorite book of the series so far.
B006ZJJ70O|5.0|First the good news. This is MUCH cheaper than when it was issued back in 1997. The remastering is the same, so yes, that wierd noise the crept in the remastering of the Coriolan Overture is still here. That noise is not present on the original CD issue. It's great that you can get all of Stoky's RCA stereo recordings for a bargain price, but it's too bad that the informative liner notes by Edward Johnson are no longer here. But hey, it's nice to have this set back in print. Filled with what has to be the GREATEST Brahms 4th symphony EVER, backed with an AMAZING Mahler 2, that alone is worth this entire set. If you love the Brahms 4th, I promise you have never really heard it until you hear Stowkowski's utterly gripping performance. His Eroica is fine too, but on the whole, not on the same level of greatness as other Eroica's available, but still a good performance. His 6th version of the Dvorak New World is also a great one. Indeed, I can say it's probably the GREATEST version out there, along with a highly emotional 6th symphony by Tchaikovsky. It's no wonder American Record Guide said that Stoky's version was the best one ever recorded. What is also very interesting is the rehearsal disc. A chance to hear the master in action! If you missed this the first time, don't miss out this time around.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I read this book I was amazed how action packed and funny it was I can't wait to read the next book in the series
B004Y042N8|4.0|Many of the puzzles are very easy but this is still a fun game. Especially if you can't sleep which is common for me.
B0039TAHMA|4.0|loved the movie it was awesome recommend it to an any one who can get lost in an imaginative world
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am a Spider freak and play all the time. This is my favorite version. The tap method is great for a speedy game.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|The hills are alive!  Haven't had a chance to view it yet, but we are looking forward to this blu ray version
B0086700CM|4.0|Lots of fun...would be better if there were more accumulate good stuff...if you know what I mean! F<br />unrun! I like it.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This film looks great - the cinematography on this film is nice, with some great locations. In HD on a good TV, the snowy mountains are crisp and beautiful, the cities hot and sweaty. The acting is also fine. Edward Norton gives a great performance, understated as always.<br /><br />The story and writing are good. My only problem is with the direction and editing, which is sometimes quite disjointed. I was very disappointed with the car chase scene, which was far too long and contributes nothing to the story.<br /><br />This is not a Jason Bourne movie. It's a present day action movie with some sci fi themes, set in the Bourne universe. I recommend it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|FASCINATING.  Wether true or not, it's \\"can't put  it down\\" exciting.  Descriptions are like watching a movie in your mind.<br /><br />Hope to see the movie.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A good plot and excellently drawn characters draw the reader in so that you don't want to put down the book!
0345529057|5.0|We have watched the show, Love it.  Now she is reading and filling me in on the details the book goes through and I am captivated just hearing the second hand account.  Very good story.
B0090SI42Y|4.0|My wife loves Russell Crowe. I believe, were she not constrained by a lack of resources, she might stalk him. As it is, we own every movie, television show, interview and album he is has ever done. [As a complete aside, his singing in Les Mis is much better than that on any of his albums, though the movie itself seems to have been shot by a monkey in the throws of seizures with one hand on the zoom controls.] This is not what one might consider a traditional later career Crowe movie. This is a fun movie that harkens back to 70's Kung Fu movies, reimagined, with digital effects, for a contemporary but cinematically-aware, audience. The point of this movie is not acting, dialogue or the finer points of continuity and razor keen narrative revelation: this is for people with metal skin, knife-guns and a porcupine-like amount of blades (not that porcupines carry blades, unless they grew up in a deeply troubled home, which one might also be able to tell by their white t-shirts rolled up at the shoulders, over a pack of cigarettes) to molest, murder and mutilate each other.<br />Over the top theatrics, operatic bouts of violence and slow motion--this is someone who watch many Shaw Brothers movie as well as John Woo's oeuvre and thought &#34;violence is cool.&#34;<br />I must ding this two stars though for not being the best filmed action scenes ever. It does a disservice to those scenes as a matter of fact, with poor understanding of capturing the ballet of cinematic violence. I give it back one star because my wife would do terrible things with Ben-gay, Nair and Superglue to me in my sleep for awarding anything Russell has done with less than 4 stars.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can't wait for the third book to come out!!! If you loved 50 Shades then this is your next read for sure!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. We don't regret this purchase at all!! Not a movie for children though.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|omg i love this game so much and now theres a kindle around i can play everywhere. i have it on my pc but i like it better on the kindle easier to move around and beat the levels a little quicker bigger brighter makes me happy

B0017SWPXY|3.0|Being a dog lover, I was drawn to a story written in the voice of a dog.  Overall, I enjoyed the story of Enzo but the chapters solely on racing statistics were not interesting to me.  The author clearly loves racing and all it entails but I did not find that the stats etc tied into the story at all.  Good story but I wouldn't read it again.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a game I played on my husband's cell, but I now play it on my Kindle Fire.  It's fun and relaxing after a long day at the office.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I luv this book because it has romance, action, and drama all things I like in a book it deserved 5 stars
B005SMVCZC|5.0|What every workplace should incorporate.<br /><br />This book is very fun to read, and it always keeps your interest making you want to read on and on.<br />Everyone should read this book. I rounded up on my rating. I would say 4.9/5. lol. I personally don't drink, swear, or am into bars and such; that's the reason for the 4.9/5. :)
B002LL1686|2.0|Why are there even different regions for blu rays? And why would Amazon ever send me one from a different region. Clearly shipping to us, I need a us compatible blu ray.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Works just as good as on Facebook, love this game, very addicting, can play Bingo from the comfort of your home and not spend real money haha
B00275EHJG|4.0|yes i liked the movie and was glade it arrived when it did and i would recommend it to anyone
B0007KS7D0|5.0|Highly recommend this product for macro photography. I use i t on my canon sx40HS and the photos really pop. Tripod is helpful.
B0030IIYYS|4.0|yes i liked teh movie and was pleased that it arrived when it did, would recommend it to anyone now
B006XF5BTG|3.0|He refers a lot to this body builder website for supplements you should buy, one must wonder his true intentions for writing this book! He also refers to this same website for proper form on how to do an exercise, yet on several occasions the name of the exercises do not match up! Eg weighted dips. Overall it reads more like an catalogue for bodybuilders.com than a self help guide
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Gut wrenching and, while wildly predictable,  the twist thrown in at the end pushed my four-star rating to a five.
B001HC8516|5.0|Every woman needs to read this book before they get married. Trust me....unless you are a lesbian.  I do believe it is possible to marry someone who is just not into you. But once you are married you can't just break it off....
B0086700CM|5.0|love the game and it provides about 2 1/2 hours of nonstop playing for me personally.So basically, I would highlly recommend this game for anyone who loves to earn points by challenging themselves.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Very handy app for reading PDF's and the like. I read many manuals for various products on my Sony phones and Kindle Fire with this.<br /><br />Try it you'll like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was drawn into this book immediately. The characters and story grabs a hold of you and you can't put it down. Very moving . I loved it!
B00001OH1S|5.0|Very nice cool sounding music from the update movie of Thomas Crown Affair. Very high on the list of music soundtracks. One notable song, Sinnerman, is used in other soundtracks, and is a very infectious tune. This song cannot be downloaded as an mp3, but all the other songs can.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I watched this movie because I love Channing Tatum. While it was fun to watch, there was not alot of substance to the plot. Sexy but somewhat lame.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|I use this on my Sony Xperia TL and X10, and Kindle. I tried Mobo Video, but the video is way too grainy. This app will identify all your videos and play them back in a smooth crystal clear manner. In fact, my computer players, Media Player, Media Center, or Nero, will not play back some of my lower resolution videos and make them look this nice. MX player on Kindle is not really fully tested. I put one mp4 clip on it yesterday and it played half the clip, which I think some other reviewers mentioned. May need Kindle fixes.<br /><br />Still, I rather this played well on my cell phones, because my phones have 16-42GB of storage and the Kindle Fire has only 8GB, and not even all of that is usable. For FREE, try it out.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This movie is awesome and great on blueray. Shipped fast and was packaged in a bubble wrap envelope. I would recommend this movie to anyone with kids.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game was made for Kindle or a pad based device. Is fun on phones, but Kindle is way better. Get some friends and draw pictures to see if they can guess what your goofy picture is all about. Pick a color(any color), width, and move your finger on the touch device to make a picture of the word you've chosen. I have one friend that is a good artist and am amazed at some of the drawings sometimes. Fun for the entire family and FRIENDS.<br /><br />Try it!!
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Pictures come out fuzzy not clear photos at all kinda disappointed in the camera option.Thought the pictures would come out with HD quality.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you use eBay at all, this is a must app. I use it on Sony phones and Kindle Fire. Remember, nothing is going to replace internet explorer for supreme functionality, but gives you a lot of good usage.<br /><br />Try it you'll like it.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|If you think the book is like the play or movie, you are in for a surprise.  The first several chapters are all about the priest.  I thought it would be about Valjean.  Good book, just not what I expected.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|First, I'm not sure you can actually use this to play games. I just use it to check my account and purchase games to play on the big computer. I've loaded this on my Sony Xperia TL phone, laptop, and Kindle. Steam will send you an email with a code to put in for your first time usage to verify who you are. I also use this on my laptop, but again, my laptop is too woefully underpowered to actually play a game. You will need a Steam account to use this. All FREE.<br /><br />NOW, Steam is the bomb on my i7 860 core computer. Steam is web based. You buy games from them, they manage them, update them(very important to fix bugs), and play the games that you have downloaded to the computer. Fixing the bugs and glitches is very important. Back in the old days you had to find websites with patches(bug fixes) and apply them to your games that weren't working properly(and hope for the best). Steam does it all and does it amazingly well. Never a hitch in your game play.<br /><br />They have hundreds of games at great prices to download and play. If you keep an eye on their weekly sales you can sometimes buy an entire series of games like Half Lifes or Crysis at a ridiculously cheap price that is impossible to find elsewhere. Best part about all of this too, there are no discs to shuffle in and out of your devices or carry around and store. If you have a really good laptop, you could be gaming anywhere in the world. They also have all the top games to download. Unless, the game is say Xbox or Playstation exclusive.
B000JKA1MS|4.0|My grandson really liked the looks of this tournament knight as well as its ability to be moved around without the knight falling off the horse.<br /><br />Quilting Grammy
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Weather Channel is good on all my devices. I love the 10 day weather outlook. Are other fancier apps out there, but WC is no nonsense and is never glitchie like some of the showy apps.
0375842209|5.0|My heart is broken. Pulverized. Shattered. I'm not surprised, not really. I knew I was in for a ride when I cried while reading the prologue. The Prologue. I mean, seriously? The book hadn't even officially started yet and I was moved to tears. It could have been the subject matter of the story but, more than likely, it was the words that were used to tell that story. Because, if nothing else, Markus Zusak schools you in the power of words. Not only their ability to tell a story, but the incredible power they have to hurt, to comfort, to inspire, to heal. To Destroy. To Save.<br /><br />\\"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\\"<br /><br />The Book Thief is the story of a young girl growing up Nazi Germany. A girl who steals books, befriends a Jew, and refuses kisses from a boy with hair the color of lemons. A normal girl who happens to live during a tragic time in history. And while this story is far from ordinary, the way that it was written is what makes it truly extraordinary.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book was the writing. Zusak has this ability to describe things in such a way that they completely come to life. They pop off of the page, get right in your face, and dare you not to get sucked in.<br /><br />\\"The crowd was itself. There was no swaying it, squeezing through or reasoning with it. You breathed with it and you sang its songs. You waited for its fire.\\"<br /><br />On top of that, Zusak is a master storyteller. He takes his time weaving his tale, making sure that you are completely invested in his world and the characters that live within it. These people are your neighbors, your friends, and your family. You know every facet of their everyday lives: their worries, their hopes, their fears. You come to know each of them intimately, which is a blessing and a curse, because the more he gives to you, the more he can take away. And take he does, but not without warning. At least he gives us that.<br /><br />But it's not the sad things that define this book, it's the reminder that even in the darkest times, the strength and warmth of the human spirit can still shine through. It's an accordion player with a heart of gold. It's words painted on a basement wall. Thirteen gifts at the foot of a bed. Stars that burn your eyes. A snowman in the cellar. It's the bread giver. The word shaker. The book thief. It's the knowledge that even through tragedy, hope can be found.<br /><br />\\"In years to come, he would be a giver of bread, not a stealer--proof again of the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. Just add water.\\"<br /><br />If you have not read this book yet, do yourself a favor and do it now. The Book Thief is one of those books that will rock your world and, quite possibly, change your life. I know it's one of the best books that I've ever read and has earned a permanent home on my bookshelf. I cannot recommend it enough.<br /><br />Originally posted at brilliantlynovel.wordpress.com
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is flat out addictive. If you are tenacious, perfectionist, casual gamer, you will get hooked. Before you know it, you will be at it for hours trying to get the perfect three star score. If you settle for one star, you love it too. Anyone can play this game.<br /><br />Get the paid app though. Sometimes the ads can be hugely annoying. So for a dollar, go no ads.
0553582038|5.0|The Song of Ice and Fire series (better known as Game of Thrones, thanks to the HBO series) has been a recent highlight for me as a reading teacher. It is a great, mind-bending series that meshes knights in shining armor, lost magics, royal intrigue, and nefarious plots. The fourth book is no exception, bringing even more depth to an already awe-inspiring level of detail. More character information, more geography details, more political strategy - in short, more of everything there is to love about the series.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Very nice calculator, and attractive too. Works perfect, and I believe that it also has some functions for those of you that know how to use the higher math operations. Try it out.
B001HN6922|5.0|The original Cars movie introduced a fairly novel idea and some great characters.  Cars 2 steps it up a notch with vehicles of every shape and size from around the world.  All our favorites make an appearance, with lots of new characters to love as well.  As with most Pixar movies, there's references that will make adults chuckle just as much as the kids will laugh at some of the slapstick.  Overall, a great family film that is well worth adding to your collection.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If you compare this to Ad-Free this would be 9stars I guess. So get the ad free version. Best game ever on phone or handheld device. Challenging and fun for all. Not a gamer, try it anyway. It is too fun. It's FREE.

B003O86FMW|5.0|About to go buy the second book right now. Can't wait to read the last installment. This is almost as good as twilight
B008XG1X18|2.0|Love pinterest, hate this app. This app is best at telling me it isn't responding. Duh, I can see that. It would be my favorite app if it actually worked once in a while!
B008F5YDRI|1.0|Very frustrating b/c it was downloaded But then it wouldn't play so I ended up  paying $3.99 and never got to watch it plus it's impossible to try to find help on the Amazon website there's no contact information
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fortunately or unfortunately, I loved these books! I admit that was initially intrigued by the \\"descriptive\\" scenes promised...the dark side...but found myself so caught up in Ana's emotions and inner struggle as well as Christian's struggle within himself, I couldn't put the books down. Thank you!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good detail, and suspense particularly at the end. Somewhat confusing about the sister hanging with the start but it works Ok in the end.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|There are too many people cheating on this game.  The odds of the same person winning 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are very slim.  And also, doing it back to back is really unfair.<br /><br />I would not recommend this game.
B003GJSUPY|5.0|One of the great live albums of the 70s!Do not know if its remastered or not but sounds awesome on the road.
1451695195|4.0|Too bad it takes a highly respected neurosurgeon's testimony to open the eyes of the non believers as to there's more to life than what meets the eyes. Good book that stretches past the normal yada yada medical explanations of consciousness into the nuts and bolts of logical common sense. This book will open the eyes of the reader to pursue other authors versions of the mysterious ways of the conscious and subconscious mind. Sometimes the author gets a little wordy try to explain something he doesn't understand either.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|woo! it got here fast and i'm fairly sure the person i gave it to for christmas loved it. yup.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Fun app. Can record your own songs or play along with per-programmed ones, or just have them auto-play. You certainly won't be Mozart, but you can have fun with it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was inspiring.  It was really described.  This is my second time reading the hunger games because it is so inspiring read.
0785163174|5.0|I love it this book answers and tell's you a \\"What if \\" story  when Iron Man battles Magneto who will win? Hawkeye vs Angel, Iron fist vs Iceman and many more the artwork is beautiful this is a must get book especially if your a Marvel fan
B002VECLVO|1.0|I bought this DVD because I had become a fan of Colin Firth since Pride and Prejudice, and much later, The King's Speech.  The Single Man was a disappointment.  The story makes no sense, it depicts a man supposedly attempting suicide because of his male lover's death.  Nearly nothing is learned about the departed, and the character himself has no depth, no saving qualities.  I hated this movie, and it was hard for me to watch the whole thing.  I do not recommend this movie; it is depressing.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Of Mice and Men was short, but rivoting.  I enjoy reading John Steinbeck novels.  I remember reading them as a teenager and wanted to read them again.  I would recommend this book to mature readers.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I loved this movie.  It probably is not biographical entirely, but it is a beautiful story of love.  It has some intrigue, jealousy, betrayal, but young love triumphs.  What else does one need these days of political disappointment?
B005IQZB14|3.0|Woman's book she has too many prblems. First one than another and that brings up another. It just leads you into another
0738711500|5.0|I was curious about Tarot, and I got what I hoped would easy to learn and use cards.  They were all that and more.  The pictures on the cards were beautiful, and the instruction book was easy to follow and understand.  I highly recommend this package of cards and book to anyone who wants to learn about Tarot and have some serious fun with the cards.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|Good old time sound and feel.<br /><br />Good new take on some old classics.<br /><br />Overall a great buy that I would recommend again.

B003UMW68Y|5.0|Love this movie. Bought 2 disc set so grandkids could have one. Have watched it many times on TV and on disc.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you have never read a Stephen King book because you are adverse to the macabre style he has come to be known for- don't let the stop you from reading 11/22/63. It is a far cry from his Pet Cementary days. Although still infused with a sense of the \\"other\\" it is a sweet book about a well meaning hero and one of the  most pivotal events of the 20th century. Like other reviewers have said- even though you \\"know\\" the ending of history about JFK it doesn't stop you from holding on tightly to the hope that everything with work out fine. It is really the subplot of the main character Jake aka George that will keep you hanging on. Also the believable question about how the future is affected by the past-that theme explored by every time travel book there is- is shared with fresh eyes by the matter of story telling (not of just macabre) Mr. King.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An apocalypse without the zombies - an even more frightening and dismal future exists for the survivor's descendants.  Living in the silo living by rules set down so long ago no one seems to know their purpose.  Anyone who even speaks a seditious word could find themselves sent outside for cleaning where the air is not only toxic, but corrosive.  People are being murdered for discovering the truth and wanting change.  No mobile phones, no unlimited texting, no PC's, no TV's, no radio or CDs and not even a newspaper.  Education is a \\"thing of the past\\"; elephants just a myth.  Enter the Lottery if you want to have a child because population control is imperative to the silos survival.  Everything is controlled, but by whom?  An uprising is to be feared; no one knows what caused the last one, people fear cleaning too much to pass down  stories.  I shall certainly be looking for the continuation of this story as it seems to have many ways to offshoot which I'm not going to spoil for you!

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was amazing. So many emotions ran through me in the short 24 hour period it took me to devour this book. I cried, I laughed, I smiled, I even swooned over the love story. I loved this book! This is a must read! I look forward to starting the second book in this saga!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I love all of Jodi Picoult's book.  This one was as well-written as al the others.  I highly recommend it.

B003UESJH4|1.0|Dreadful flick, long, boring, nothing redeemable about it.<br />AM surprised it was even made into a movie.<br />If you like stuffy films this is for you.
B000TGJ80S|3.0|I thought I was getting a new DVD, the collectors edition with two discs. The product was sealed in paper as if it were new, but it was clear that the cover had been handled and when I opened the case, I only had one disc. I was a bit disappointed about that. However, I purchased it to have the movie to show clips when I teach the novel Dracula. So far the movie has worked fine. I am hoping since I got a used DVD that the movie will hold up.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved it, what else can I say<br />Full of such delightful stories the book was so good I bought the DVD

B000055Y0X|5.0|Well, maybe not dark, more like shady I guess.  Scary thing is, it makes you wonder how much of the content is factual!!  Highly recommend for anyone 40 or older but younger generations should enjoy it too.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good but not his best. Grisham is consistently excellent, of course, but the Racketeer doesn't quite live up to what you expect from him. Still a good read, though.
1416550550|4.0|About three chapters into this book, I knew I was in for a treat. Morton has written a sprawling, meticulously plotted novel that spans decades, interweaves stories and is filled with good old-fashioned storytelling. It felt delicious to read ... kind of like slipping into a hot bath and settling in for a long soak. (Perhaps that is why it took me an unprecedented 10 days to read!)<br /><br />The story--which alternates between three different time periods--deals with the issues of identity and family ties. The main story concerns a 4-year-old girl who is found alone on a dock in Australia--seemingly alone in the world after arriving on a ship from England. Adopted by the harbormaster after no one claims her, the girl grows up unaware of her origins, until her adoptive father reveals it to her after his wife's death. Shocked and unbalanced by this news, the girl pursues the mystery of her identity and biological family--using only the meager clues left to her. Upon her death, the mystery is taken up by her granddaughter, who has a tragic story of her own. Shifting between the present day, the mid-1970s and the early 1900s, The Forgotten Garden unfolds slowly and carefully--with Morton interweaving each story line seamlessly.<br /><br />I have to say that I admire Morton's skills in crafting this story. She does a brilliant job of mixing Eliza's, Nell's and Cassandra's stories in a way that felt fluid and natural. We'd learn something in one time period and then go back and get the details in the next chapter. I really enjoyed this way of telling the story. It felt like historical fiction mixed with contemporary fiction mixed with literary fiction. The mystery at the heart of the book was also satisfying ... I thought I'd figured everything out only to have Morton toss me a curve ball. I love when that happens!<br /><br />The other aspect I enjoyed was how the Eliza Makepeace character is a writer of fairy tales, and we get to read these stories at different points throughout the book. I loved how the fairy tales shed light on the events of the story ... without that always being immediate obvious to the reader. The only thing that could have improved the story even more is if they had included the illustrations that were created for the fairy tale book! (I suppose that is asking a little too much though.)<br /><br />I totally get why people gush over Kate Morton. If this is the kind of books she writes, then sign me up for more! This was a very satisfying read, and I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys good old-fashioned storytelling that is crafted with care by the author. So, Morton fans, which one should I try next?hroughout the book. I loved how the fairy tales shed light on the events of the story ... without that always being immediate obvious to the reader.

B002YCVWXQ|4.0|War is hell and the lead Nazi got what he deserved in the end. Excellent Director and Pitt was very good as well.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I used this in a mini-ITX gaming rig I built recently. It was my first custom built PC. Although this is the unlocked model, I have not yet overclocked it because I have not bought a CPU cooler yet. With this CPU and my GTX 560Ti graphics card, I can run every game I own (ie. Skyrim, GTA IV, Metro 2033) on maximum graphics settings. When that is no longer the case, I will buy a CPU cooler and overclock this thing. Would recommend!
B005KJZDXK|3.0|Overall kind of a sleepy Christmas album so if you enjoy that sort of thing, this will be perfect for you.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A good, and funny, Robinson Crusoe story. I like those kinds of books so 4 stars on this one. I recommend it.
1594745692|5.0|The zombie theme in this deck is fun and a new approach to the tarot readings; also love the vintage style.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|I got the first offering based on the strength of a variety of reviews. It's not my typical interest. I've enjoyed it while traveling and when I wake up in the middle of the night. I'll finish the series and get back to the basics.
1582701709|2.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone.  What truth there is to be found in it is buried beneath a lot of claptrap.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|This was inspiring to me. I loved her story and will read it again.<br />I always did believe in reincarnation so her NDE was reaffirming.
B005VOXOYO|4.0|great depiction of a peregrine falcon but, for me, the price was a bit steep.  Maybe it is meant more for a collector and I was buying it for my 6-year-old grandson who likes peregrine falcons.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this for my deployment and I couldn't ask for anything better. great soung great screen, and it stores exceptionally well while onthe move deffinite need to have if you are on the move and love your games
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is an all time classic that we enjoy each and every year.  The Blu-ray makes it even better. Thank You.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|I must say that I became interested in this show after hearing so many rave reviews about it from everybody at work & on social media! Being that I'm already a natural Zombie & Horror fan I had to check it out for myself to see what al the hype was about. So I ordered The Walking Dead the complete first season on Amazon (I don't have cable anymore) website and after watching it, I quickly became a fan for various reasons. I will be watching all future episodes on DVD as well!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Season 8 of How I Met Your Mother is fantastic. A lot goes on in this season, things I was hoping would happen for all 7 seasons- although those were great as well
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the second book in this series and can't wait to read the next! I would highly recommend-it's so hard to put down!
0316023744|5.0|Just finished reading this book. Couldn't put it down. I've read several of Mr Beevor's books and this one is probably his best! Fully encompasses the entire Second World War.
B002N44XSG|5.0|The stories were absolutely amazing. Very well done creating the stories. I absolutely loved them. They were so exciting. The best story was the story about Hades' sword. I loved all of the action in the story. I think that Rick Riordan did an amazing job writing this book

B007HO392S|3.0|I have all of Carrie's albums and this is my least favorite.  It took me a while to order the CD following its release date because the clips didn't seem that great; but I'm going to see her in concert in a few weeks and wanted to know the new songs.  However, I don't want to listen to it over and over like I usually do.  I feel it's a little more pop than country, which is okay, but it doesn't feel like Carrie to me.<br /><br />I do however love the new Amazon Auto Rip feature.  I could listen to the album from my cloud while I waited on the CD to arrive.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|If you just need to put a little edge on a knife, this tool is good.  It does not replace professional sharpening tools.  There is no way, without some measure of industrial tools, to put an good edge back on serrated blades, so don't go believing the little stick thingy is a true solution.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if I just need a little touch-up, this will grind down and then properly hone an edge for routine use.  I use it for several of my thumb-openers at work, which need to be sharp and clean on a consistent basis.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome only if there were more! Sincerely your biggest fan/most enthused for the next movie catching fire. I have read the whole trilogy of the hunger games books i love your work sincerely, Brad Montgomery. Hendersonville, Tennessee
1451648537|4.0|This is a very compelling portrait of the truly iconic individual of our time.  This is a very good biography, inspite of the complexity of Jobs, his work and the tech industry, and not so pretty side of Jobs' personality and relationships, the book is written with fairness, integrity and respect.  The author excels also in describing/explaining the fast moving, competitive world of technology, culture, politics and business that are not always easy to grasp for average readers that are not so up to date with those subjects.  I didn't think I was going to like it, and I didn't care to know much about his other than what had been known through media coverage, I only decided to read it because he was so influential in changing everyday life, but I was wrong, very wrong.  I learned alot about this infinitely passionate, brilliant, equally flawed Jobs and the people who were smart and patient enough to be around him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent work Collins did a fantastic job of making katniss very complex,and adds deep emotional complexities for both her and peeta. A difficult feat to accomplish while keeping the language simple enough for all audiences
B009VA1FN6|3.0|It's had good reviews so I think I was expecting more. Didn't really like the style of writing. It's the first Kate Morton book I've read & have heard since that her other books are better.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|Great cerebral movie, excellent visuals, striking storyline and completely swank action scenes. Deffinitely a kick butt girl power type movie with a dark twist. I'd reccomend it for anyone who likes movies that make you think, also see the movie Brazil, witch I would consider a much older precursor or inspiration to movies such as this.
B002TZ3C8G|4.0|Always love the way the author writes . Very proper , but quircky at the<br />same time . Well constructed , plausible plot ( bit far fetched ) easy to<br />read .

1607066017|5.0|i bought this comic on a whim, and i can't describe how much i love this story. there is so much potential just waiting to be written. i will buy every issue and graphic novel they put out for saga, that's just how good it is! if you aren't sure if you'll like it just give it a try, if you enjoy scifi you will be sucked into this world created in these pages! favorite book of 2012.. hands down.
1609611543|2.0|This book goes into the history of wheat and everything about wheat and its makeup that you never wanted to know! this book goes on for chapter and chapters about the evils of wheat and why it's so bad for us. I bought the book and wanted to get right into the diet plan...but had to skip numerous tedious chapters about wheat. It was more like taking a science class.  I don't need 6 chapters about the history of wheat and why it's bad. Just give me the diet plan and the recipes, already!<br /><br />It dawned on me, while struggling through this book, that if you cut out ANY food group,you are going to lose weight. Cut out all sugar and products containing sugar, for example and you will lose weight! If you cut out all wheat, you will lose weight! Not rocket science. Now there's a book out claiming SUGAR is the culprit! It doesn't say a word about cutting out wheat. What to believe?? It we believed ALL the diet books which are based on eliminating a specific food, we'd just be eating veggies all day.<br /><br />I've lost weight since reading this book and it wasn't by eliminating wheat. I eat wheat in moderation (only whole wheat) and exercise every day and that's done the trick. I feel great. We are much too trusting in this country, looking for the magic bullet...especially if the author is a doctor. Lose weight, on ANY plan, and your blood test numbers are going to improve just by virtue of having lost the weight. The culprit is not wheat or sugar or animal products, the culprit is your fork!

B005LAII12|5.0|This is hands down one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! Seth McFarlene is a comical genius! Held true to his Family Guy no one is safe politically incorrect humor, this movie is by far a classic! Mark Wahlberg is so likable and who knew, hilarious! Absolutely loved him in this! Mila Kunis was great in this as well, but the main focus is on Ted and Mark!<br />Highly recommend to anyone who loves dirty no holds barred type of comedy. This is not for the conservative up tight no sense of humor crowd.

B002GHHHME|5.0|U.S. Marshal John `Eraser' Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) rescues Johnny Casteleone (Robert Pastorelli) and his wife from execution by the Mob. Kruger works for the Federal Witness Protection Program (WitSec). His next assignment is to protect Lee Cullen (Vanessa L. Williams), a senior executive at a firm (Cyrex) that manufactures equipment for the military. Cullen discovers that her company is planning to sell sophisticated equipment to Russia, so copies her evidence onto computer discs to give to the FBI. The man giving Kruger his assignments is Chief Arthur Beller (James Coburn) but his immediate superior in the field is U.S. Marshal Robert DeGuerin (James Caan). Cullen's boss at Cyrex is William Donohoe (James Cromwell), who is happy to sell arms to the highest bidder, though his role in the film is short-lived. As might be expected, there's some sophisticated weaponry in use her on both sides. As a security measure, Cullen copies the disc and gets in touch with a reporter on the Washington Herald, Claire Isaacs (Roma Maffia). Leading the search for Cullen in order to eliminate her is the Under-Secretary for Defense, Daniel Harper (Andy Romano). An added complication is that there is a `mole' or two within WitSec who is eliminating the very witnesses they are supposed to be protecting. This is an exciting thriller with plenty of Arnie action.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|It's life in the making and people who finally choose truth and good instead of deception and lies. I'd read it again.
B009M7G1PU|1.0|This electronic version is terrible to read because of the way it was formatted. At work there is a software program that translate text into pdf, however, when it translates it misses words and mangles sentence structure. This version does the same.<br /><br />It is sad that there is no editor to review the version before it is electronically 'printed'. As this is no longer copyright protected, it would have been nice if the publishers had spent a little money on editing.<br /><br />I would not recommend.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading the Wheel of Time series in 1993. So this has been a 20 year journey for me. The final installment in this series left me breathless. I cheered, I cried, I laughed and I think I nearly died. This series has always been known for its ability to transport the reader right into the story. And this installment is no different. Mr Sanderson has done a fabulous job finishing the journey Robert Jordan was taking all of us on. I have seen the mixed nature of the ratings for the book. 50/50.......5 stars or 1 star. I actually read about 50 of those 1 star reviews. All I found was a lot of folks upset about no ebook. I to was very upset that I will have wait until April for the kindle version. But what does that have to do with the quality of the work itself?  NOTHING!  It is actually detracting from the glow that this amazing work should have. I had the honor of meeting Robert Jordan a year before &#34;he woke from the dream&#34;. I am certain that he would hope his work to be judged by its merits and not those of the publisher's marketing strategy. I myself do still plan to get the ebook version, but have also finish the hardback print version. This is the type of work I want others to see on my bookshelf, alongside my signed birthday gift from Mr Jordan. But that is how I feel about the print version. Please folks, let's review the work itself and not the publisher or reseller.  ALL HAIL THE LORD OF MORNING!  Raise the Golden Crane! Forward Malkier!

So i decided to head back when i heard that Gavin Harrison was playing kit.  They compliment themselves really well on this go around.  Few of the tracks have some nice time signatures hammering away and others are straight ahead.  I'm pleased with these tracks for sure.  And for 5 bones that's not too shabby.<br /><br />Cheers
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fantastic story that helped me understand so much more about near death experiences and our material life here on earth.  I believe in God, this book confirms that our God is there for us.  I recommend this book to everyone with an open mind to read Eben Alexander's book.

B0053O89WY|5.0|A lot of shows start to lose their gusto in later seasons but not TBBT. Every season just gets better and better. Season 5 includes Amy and Bernadette as main cast members so it's becoming a great ensemble cast.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|The sound tract was awful... I could barely understand the characters words except when Bane was speaking, which was too loud and very muffled because of the mask, I guess. The lighting was terrible through the entire movie. Everything was too dark... always in shadows. And most importantly, if you're making a movie about Batman, shouldn't 'The Batman' appear in costume more often? The injured Bruce Wayne had a lot of face time as he hobbled through the scenes, but only appeared as Batman a few times and got his butt kicked more often than not. I expected a lot of action as there is in all the other super hero movies of late, but this installment of Dark Knight was poorly written and poorly directed. I'm hoping this will remain a Trilogy thus ending this installment and I hope the next time it's remade someone will finally get it right.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This show is so great because it's a smart funny. The writers don't have to throw in a ton of dirty jokes to make you laugh. And you also don't have to be a genious to understand the show. It's awesome.
B0063IH60K|4.0|We enjoy the game very much and find it to be very addictive.  At night when programming is not good this helps to pass the time away.

B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I initially downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire expected a more &#34;traditional&#34; Mahjong game - meaning 1 puzzle.  I got 6 &#34;piles&#34; of tiles.  I found the configuration too busy and therefore more difficult to play.  I have since deleted the game from my Kindle.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I normally recommend reading the book before watching the movie. But the cast of the movie did such a fantastic job of bringing the emotions to life on the screen that it made the book even better. As soon as I finished the last page, I re-opened it from the beginning an re-read it all over again.
B009POCG2C|5.0|This was good, especially for a baseball fan.  Even though I'm not a big Clint Eastwood fan, I enjoyed his acting alot.  The movie also had a good human nature plot in addition to the baseball aspect.  Overall, it was great!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I don't think that if the situation in this book was real that the man would have wanted to stay married. I was a little unrealistic, but a fun quick read.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is a beautiful album. I bought it as a gift to my friend, but I had a run or two with it in the car and I own it digitally. You won't regret getting it in any format!

B008CP93S0|4.0|pretty funny movie i love both jennifer aniston and paul rudd and it thoroughly entertained me ive even watched it twice
B0063IH60K|1.0|Nobody, I would not recommend a Kindle to anyone, they are very touchy, and if you tap the wrong place it is very hard to get out of a jam.  I am about ready to take it backto best buy  I don't knowhow to play it, there are no instructions  You can't get to the user's guide, because you  have to knlow how to get into the Kindle in the first place. Any call to Amazon for assistance with my Kindle results in a 2 hour phone call.

B007KOYEOC|1.0|The ending was nice, other than that the plot was even more unbelievable than the first two and the characters and lack of background information even more aggravating still.

B0083O0ZHS|3.0|This is a review of the ABBA \\"The Visitors\\" Deluxe Edition which includes a remastered CD of the album and a DVD with a few songs & interviews. I remember back in the early '80's when I bought the vinyl record. No one could know at that time it would be their last. At that time I didn't think the music was as catchy & uplifting as previous albums. The tone in this album is a little too serious and in retrospect must have reflected the group may have known the end was near. 30 years later my original feeling holds. There are a few songs I like, \\"One of Us\\", \\"The Day Before You Came\\", \\"When All Is Said & Done\\" but the rest not so much. Actually the middle song mentioned was not on the original album and was a bonus track. I have read the nearly 100 reviews of people on this site and the consensus is this may have been their best album musically and from an innovative standpoint. This may well be true. Perhaps looking back maybe I have less enthusiasm knowing now this was the last album and it made me sad it was over and maybe a little sore so I can't separate that. The disappointment I stated in my title is moreso with the DVD included. I have all the deluxe editions and this one to me the makers mailed-in. I don't know if ABBA had much input on what goes on the DVD's? Maybe it was Polar & Universal Music that made all the decisions? What has struck me is there is absolutely no consistency to the deluxe edition CD/DVD combos. They weren't released in order and some DVD's contain alot of content including entire TV shows they did and others next to no content with only snippets from TV shows. I'll get back to that shortly. In my opinion, \\"Voulez Vous\\", \\"ABBA\\" & \\"Arrival\\" had the most content with complete TV shows and were very good. \\"Voulez Vous\\" especially was well done and looked like they made a maximum effort. There is alot of content and the menus were cool and in-motion. Outstanding. \\"ABBA: The Album\\" & \\"Super Trouper\\" had very few songs and mostly contained interviews which are interesting to see once but its the music you really want. \\"The Visitors\\" falls firmly in this with only a few songs from a Dick Cavett special you can watch on-line that was an extensive show with many good songs but only two are on this DVD! Inexcuseable. The DVD mostly is interviews that weren't in-depth. The one from the BBC in some ways was disrespectful to them and I didn't like that. The interviewer was intolerable. The second interview from Sweden was better but as I said its the music you want and not the interviews. The most interesting thing to hear is they had no intention of breaking up and laughed it off so its ironic this really ended up being the demise of the group ultimately. They may have believed what they said in the interview but maybe they were fooling themselves. The band looked somewhat older than their years and you could see I think the stress of two divorced couples trying to stay together musically. They look tired & sad in many ways. \\"The Visitors\\" cover shows them apart essentially and this album seemed to miss the togetherness the group had always had. I bought this deluxe edition because its part of their collection so without it would be like a carton of eggs missing one but in some ways I could have skipped it as it contained so little on the DVD and the music didn't cause the smiles I always have gotten from ABBA with all the other albums. Again, knowing now this was their last album may just be making it sad as a fan.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|Good movie a lot of the typical suspense movie tricks. which was predictable . Good for a Sunday with nothing better to do.

B009KHCT94|1.0|The Nazis don't even win the war at the end of the movie, so, if you are pro-nazi, don't watch this movie. Also there is an interracial relationship at the end of the movie.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I've played this game to level 50 so feel I've got enough of a feel for it to write a review. It's a cute cartoon-ish pay-for-perks \\"free\\" game, like most of the rest of TeamLava's offerings, but I suspect it's either much newer, or much older than the others. In it, you run a restaurant. You decorate it, set up different kinds of ovens and stoves to produce different meals, stock counters with food, and make sure your little patrons have enough chairs and tables to use.<br /><br />As with the other TeamLava games, decoration objects are there purely for your own viewing pleasure. It's fun to make a themed place, but ultimately I don't think anything you do there influences the patrons' spending or enjoyment. The only two things they care about are: enough tables and chairs, and enough food. If they're have those two things they're happy and will stay to eat, which will raise your happiness score (which runs 0-100) and bring more guests to some predetermined maximum. If you run out of one or the other, they're unhappy and will leave, which will lower happiness and with it the number of guests who visit. The more guests you serve, the more money you make, of course. Food itself influences the total monetary take as well; each dish raises from 1-4 coins per serving. The cooking appliances work on timers from 1 minute to 2 days for various foodstuffs, and you are limited by level in how many appliances you can have. Making food, visiting your neighbors, and doing quests gives you experience points that raise your level. Leveling is fairly quick.<br /><br />The balance of the game is of supreme importance, but TeamLava hasn't done nearly as good a job here as in its other games. Even at level 50, it's a major headache and chore just to maintain enough food for the patrons, so most people opt out of serving patrons at all by blocking their restaurant doors so they can't enter and get disappointed and leave (lowering happiness!), which cuts off quite a bit of the enjoyment of the game--seeing the little people enjoy what you've made. It's pretty easy to keep counters and racks stocked in their other games--even too easy. Producing food is way less expensive in RS than in other games, but I'd rather it be more expensive and produce more. It's such a herculean task that I began to dread trying to keep up. Something's way out of whack here!<br /><br />I also just didn't like the decoration options. TeamLava's focused here on more masculine looks, so you'll find yourself in heaven if you like 50s diners, sports, or steampunk stuff. I don't care about that stuff so much, so I had way fewer options. Of what remained, TeamLava doesn't even pretend to offer nice objects for \\"free.\\" I get that they're a business and not a charity, but such a mercenary approach backfired on me. Anything cool costs gems, which cost RL money. I'd say over half their ingame catalog, and just about every single really cute object, costs gems. Almost all feminine-looking or pink things do as well. While you can earn gems, they are so sparsely awarded you will not earn enough to populate a restaurant outside the themes I mentioned, and spending money for gems is going to get expensive quick considering how many gems most of the nicest objects needed. Also, there's no \\"are you sure?\\" option for buying objects with gems, so if you mis-touch something, too bad so sad, you own it now. Some quests also require gems, so you will need a \\"reserve\\" to finish them, further limiting how many gem-costing objects you can acquire. Considering how much I just didn't like the non-gem deco options in the game, it wasn't worth it to me to invest real money in more palatable themes. I kept hoping they'd come out with non-gem-costing options for me, or that I'd see more options as I leveled up, but it never happened.<br /><br />After a month or so of playing RS and hassling with its imbalance and lack of interesting decoration options, I finally just let my appliances run out, blockedthe door, and took RS's icon off my phone's desktop. I do not recommend this game due to the balance and deco options, and I especially don't recommend any TeamLava products for children at all due to how easy it is to spend RL money to buy gems. I hope they consider releasing some of their games in a non-gem-costing paid version, because I'd definitely pay a higher flat rate to get a game with no pop-ups and no worries about not being able to get the nicest objects.the door, and took RS's icon off my phone's desktop.

B00AHSMDQY|4.0|This movie was really good a little long for my husband but perfect for me.  I feel like the movie put a lot of effort on the story and not just the action.  I'm the only female in my house of 5 even the fish is male so a little more story was good for me.<br /><br />Great job.
0765316994|5.0|I love this book! What starts out as a simple spoofing on the original Star Trek show turns into a surprisingly deep existential quest, bringing into question the whole idea of creation. The story itself is fun, telling the story of space exploration from the POV of some \\"redshirts\\" assigned to the starship Intrepid. Yes, redshirts: those poor, often nameless schmoes who have a shockingly high mortality rate when they accompany the ships officers on away missions. The twist: some of these redshirts decide they want to live.<br /><br />The three codas are set in our present, one each from the POV of three people in the main story. They ground the story and somehow make it more poignant and real. I was left with a serious case of the warm fuzzies and a strong affection for everyone whose worlds I'd just shared.<br /><br />So very highly recommended for any SF fan with a sense of humor.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie, it was good for the both of us not just a man flic
B009POCFTG|4.0|This movie ended up on my critics list of their top 10.  I can see why!  It is really good.  Not for everyone.  It's a gritty movie with a lot of violence and blood but an excellent story.  The humor in the movie is pretty cool.  If you can handle the blood and guts definitely see this film.  Mathew McConaughney is OUTSTANDING and the other cast members are excellent as well.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The kids and I thought this movie was so awesome,  I have all boys ages 19,6 & 2 and we all love the movie

B002ZG993Q|5.0|This movie was refreshing in the extreme. It has been a long time since have seen a movie that did not spoon feed its plot to me. It did not use brass bands or flashing lights to make its points. It was subtle, quiet, and meticulous -- just like its protagonist. Some say it was slow but I thought that it was more inevitable. Like water rolling downhill everything followed it's course, like fate.<br />If you expect an action movie you will be disappointed. It is a character study of a man who is caught in current of all the choices he has made and is seeking a way out. A man no longer at the top of his form in a game where there is only one mistake per player. A man whose greatest flaw is simply that he has become lonely.<br />This movie soft and delicate and sad. Enjoy it.
B009O07NDY|5.0|The soundtrack is just as pleasant to listen to as the LotR ones are. I love the Misty Mountain's theme especially!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|George R.R. Martin has a true gift for fantasy settings, and it shows in this series debut. Every main character is well crafted and typically likable, and the details are used perfectly. I will be eagerly diving into the rest of this fantastic series in the near future!

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I have always loved Bruce Willis movies, I was happily surprised with the subject matter, something new!<br />But the biggest and best surprise was how Joseph Gordon- Levitts transformation, with ice blue contacts<br /> and a fuller face that grabbed my attention. From a cute boy actor to a very very sexy man.  I had to watch it twice!!<br />it is always good to see  something different.  the bar had been set, and this movie did take it at least that high!!!
B005TQACLC|2.0|She's better saved for produced videos with a lot of CG and professional dancers intercut.<br /><br />Live, she barely moves, lip syncs (of course) and needs help even stepping down from a 2 step staircase!<br /><br />She'd occasionally wave her arms and make some attempts at a dance move here or there, but there were no moments where you thought she was accomplishing more than any teenage girl dancing in her bedroom mirror.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love Jillian Michaels! This is my first DVD from her and so far I love it. My only concern is that the DVD is outdated and it won't let me FF thru the intro. Oh well. It's worth it tho, def recommend for everyone; beginners, intermediate and advanced bc you can take it at your own pace for all the movements so you can make it as intense as you like. I personally keep jumping in place or running in place while she explains the next move so my heart rate keeps going. Can't wait to try out her other DVDs too!!

B0090P0O70|3.0|I had expected to enjoy it but found it rather boring to read. Had seen a play which I enjoyed very much and was the reason I bought the book.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|This album is what an album should be, never the same, changing with each song, so that the band can't be labeled.  When my friends hear twenty one pilots for the first time, I am asked if it's The Killers or All American Rejects, then throw in seemingly random rap songs.  You must listen for yourself to decide but so far everyone I know has liked them.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was absolutely incredible. I have a weakness for love stories but this one contained so much more. I was on the edge of my seat and would read before I went to work, over my lunch hour and before bed.  Every spare minute was consumed with my hunger to find out what was going to happen next.  Thank you for this wonderful read. I will now be purchasing your others.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Spark has done it again! He has  created unforgettable characters we love and hate! He takes us through the myriad of emotions and thoughts of an abuser and victim and those who come in contact with them. I loved the surprising twist at the end!

B006LSZECO|1.0|There was not one sympathetic character in this novel.<br />I found the bouncing back between the husband and wife's narratives confusing.<br />The ending was inconclusive and unsatisfying.

B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 3 year old daughter LOVES this app, it is not much different from the free app except there are a few more animals for her to help and a few more things.  There are not different levels, so if your child's happy with the free app keep it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love all the chareters you can get. they All so have power ups. it is hard to play at first but you get used to it.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I really like this game but it's a bit frustrating that you lose a life unless you make two stars, even if you beat the level. For a free game it's entertaining and saving the babies is great, but to continue you have to wait or buy more energy or bubbles.It's also frustrating that you very often do not get any colors that you need at the end and you get 2 or 3 bubbles the same color one after another, mostly when you would like to have them later.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Just felt like it had been &#34;phoned in&#34;. Jean Claude was not charismatic or scary enough. I think Rutger Hauer, Steven Berkoff or Alan Rickman would have been scarier. But I did love the Chuck Norris cameos! :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I didn't know what it was really all about until I started reading. It kept my interest that's for sure and was easy to get sidetracked by the BDSM overtones. At first, after a few chapters, I wasn't sure I would like the book but I'm glad I kept reading. There is more to the story than you think at first. After reading this book- the first in the trilogy, I started reading &#34;A users Guide to Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; by Jennifer Slingerlands, a psychotherapist. This was very interesting because it provided some understanding, in a positive way, of the underlying messages in the relationship between Christine Grey and Anastasia Steele which is not so different than the &#34;typical&#34;, it also helps interpret what women and men want in a relationship as it relates to Christine Grey's seemingly unreasonable &#34;rules&#34;.  The end of &#34;fifty Shades of Grey really leaves you hanging, I had to start book two- &#34;Fifty Shades Darker&#34;!
B004QYTRRS|5.0|I have to say I am always a fan of Angelina movies and although not a big Johnny Depp fan previously, I fell hard for him in this movie! What a doll! Rent it, you'll enjoy it!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Watched this movie a couple of times.  Brings to life the life of Queen Victoria and her husband  Albert (they married and were cousins)  They had 9 children together.  Shows how they came to love and respect each other.  Prince Albert passed away at the age of 45 from consumsun (TB it would later be known.  A really great moive.  A must watch.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|The book is very intense, at the beginning. In first two weeks of my reading I was talking about nothink else than Arnold. But it becomes a little boring after about half of the book.
B0045LK31Q|4.0|Great to hear an Orb/Gilmore collaboration.  Pink Floyd certainly influenced The Orb and now things have come full circle.  If you like the textures and environments created by The Orb and David Gilmore's guitar style, you'll enjoy this album.
0307960471|3.0|I feel like I'm a reasonably intelligent person who can follow a cast of characters through a story, but I really struggled with this one.<br /><br />I had difficulty following the plot line and the cast of characters, and don't know whether that was due to the Nordic and Slavic names of all of the characters, or because the translation to English lost a bit of continuity.<br /><br />I finally connected the dots about 3/4 of the way through the book and wished I had done so earlier, but didn't care enough to go back and read all of the little clues left earlier, I just continued plowing ahead to finish the book.
6305076995|4.0|This is the best film available of Yes in the height of their wizardry. I would rate this a 5 in content for the sheer joy of watching this amazing band perform their best material except the sound on this is poor to say the least. I've been waiting years for this to come out and while it is truly amazing to watch, the question arises as to why this wasn't remastered. Sound rates about a 2, being oddly muffled and seemly recorded on a cheap tape player from the back of the concert hall. It's still great to watch and the musicianship is jaw-dropping but I often like to throw these concert videos on and play them as I would Cd's while doing other things just to have some great tunes going on in the back ground. This sound just isn't up to that quality. That being said, if your a fan of prog rock or just a fan of master musicians at work, this is a must see.

B00ATPVA78|3.0|loved the graphics and the game until it booted me out everytime I tried to get the machette out of the chiefs cottage!!!!!  To expensive to get less than halfway through the game and not be able to finish. takes too long to download.  would rate it well if I could finish the game on my kindle fire.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I found one single by Passenger and listened to the samples from the entire album. I purchased it and was not disappointed. It is more alternative rock, but each song combines to make a unified motif which is both poignant and yet at times very pleasant. I hope that they find a larger audience as they are a talented group of musicians.

I used these to interface HRD software to a Kenwood 570D and TS-2000x.. No issues..  If your an amateur radio person you will understand..
030759565X|5.0|I've made maybe twenty recipes from this cookbook already (ok, I got a little excited and didn't cook anything else for a couple of weeks). I've resisted the urge to modify the recipe on the first try and have been surprised with how often I wouldn't change a thing. Every single recipe has resulted in raves from friends and family, and I've found something lovely for every occasion from a show-stopping Christmas Eve dinner or delicious treats to bring to the office, to outstanding weekday meals.<br /><br />Another thing I love is that I've found some recipe components to be spectacular alone--for example the crepes in the hazelnut crepe cake are a revelation, I'll never use another crepe recipe again. And, the oven fries from the mussel and fries recipe are another new standard by which all fries will forever be judged. Even more reason to cook my way through the whole book, it's full of hidden treasures!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great companion to the original game.  I have been purchasing a magazine just for this game, that only had two pages worth of these puzzles,under a different name. I found the game on amazon by accident and was so happy to be able to play as much as I want.  Thanks!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game! I love this game and unlocking all the tools, I am up to 5 million points right now, and working on a higher score, it never gets old.
076115728X|5.0|This book is bright, and offers texture and excitement for any child.  Wonderful book that takes any &#34;oops&#34; and makes a great story.
B006Y9BVRM|4.0|This watch is fantastic to see in person. I don't have small wrists but even though the face of it (not including bezel) isn't too big, it looks great on my large wrist.<br /><br />The watch comes with screw in crown and screw lock pushers. You need to unscrew the locks on both pushers in order to use them. The pushers are easy to push but they definitely feel different from the automatic chronographs. I hardly feel the ‘click’ with the start/stop pusher on this watch. The caseback has polished finishing and bears the Seiko tsunami logo. The color scheme of black/yellow is very sporty and can be spotted from far away. The lume is fantastic! I can still see some of the residual lume in the mornings after a whole night of darkness.<br /><br />However, despite all this I had to return the watch.. why? I bought one from Amazon and the bezel did NOT line up and I need it to be perfect and spot on when diving and also just for aesthetics. So I returned it since I did not want to deal with this issue further (I went to the physical Seiko retailer and purchased one.. albeit for much more than Amazon's great low price). So it's a great watch for the money but buyer beware of their quality control.<br /><br />P.S. The solar function is amazing. The watch has been tested with the atomic national time and it has not lost a single second in over a month now, that's got to be a record. I keep it out of the watch box in daytime so it gets charged when it's not on my arm. Love having it be solar since automatic's and mechanical watches get tiresome after a while having to wind them.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I bawled, this book was so sad. Still, it was amazing! I am so sad for every single person who died in the hunger games trilogy, but especially Prim and Rue. Everyone said that this book was not as good as the first two, but i think it was.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|The movie itself was great. It is an action/comedy good for the whole family, as long as everyone is age 12 and up. This is because of the violence and vulgar language. The only problem I encountered was the server occasionally having to reconnect.
1423113454|5.0|While waiting for my order of the last four Percy Jackson books to arrive, I noticed the Red Pyramid was on sale in my local store and, while I was reluctant to start a new Riordan series before I finnished the Percy Jackson series, I eventually bought it and started reading it that night. I found, like all of Riodan's other books, I was hooked and literally could not put the novel down and as such I finnished it the next day.<br />Riordan is a superb fiction writer and as shown this yet again as he combined a new mythology genre with a completely new series with all the glamour of his previous books. This book has really shown how he has evolved as a writer. I also find the introduction of Khufu to be one of the best parts of the plot because let's face it, who doesn't like a baboon wearing a Lakers jersey?<br />I have just recieved my Percy Jackson books and will soon be ordering more of the Kane Chronicles so expect another review soon.

0786838655|5.0|When I was a kid I would plough through three or four books a week and would always want to get another one straight away afterwards. But sadly as in the last few years as I got into my senior years at high school I neglected reading more and more and even started finding it a bit of a chore. I realise now that I'd only read three books for leisure in the past year which profoundly shocked me. All that changed last Christmas when I opened the present my brother got me. Straight away I could tell it was a book and sadly I admit when I first read the title I was not that keen to read it. You see I had watched the movie a while ago and found it utterly boring and as such had not bought the book myself. Three days after Christmas I was stuck with absolutely nothing to do at 10 am and so I begrudgingly read the first few pages of the book to see if it was any good. Let me tell you the movie does not do it any justice because next thing I knew, it was 1 o'clock and Percy had just decapitated Medusa.<br />Percy Jackson seemed like the perfect hero to me as he went through six schools in six years only to be attacked on yet another field trip by his maths teacher Ms Dodds who none of his classmates could remember afterwards, making him feel even more crazy. When he is attacked by a minotaur and thrust into life at Camp Half Blood, he soon realizes he's the child of one of the Big Three and as such an abomination to the gods. As he's sent on a quest to recover Zeus' lightning bolt and encounters many monsters and god alike.<br />Anyway the next day the book was finished and I was back to being a kid wanting another book straight away. I ordered the Percy Jackson box set and have in the meantime begun picking apart the local library's collection on Greek Mythology.

B006OCM0G0|4.0|Ok so just because this game has adds that cost money doesn't mean you have to buy it. So I would say this game is good and you should get it.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book was so funny!!!#  it felt like I was sitting across from Ellen just talking about all these things. She is a great person and extremely funny!  Read this book and you will feel the same way I did!

1597801585|5.0|The story is a real slow burner. Don't expect to love it in the first 50 pages.  The time spend to create the world is at the expense of the characters, however the payoff is brilliant as the characters really jump out in a fully formed fantastically imagined world.<br /><br />The story takes its time because it's important to feel that this really could happen, this isn't some far flung apocalyptic dystopia this is a future which feels very real.  The viewpoints of each character reflect the fear of this world, the opportunities and the greed.<br /><br />It's worth every second to read this book twice. On the second read  I was so absorbed I almost had a fever reading it!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it is funny and stupid at the same time.  it is easy to play and anyone can see how easy it is.
B008VNIBFO|5.0|Very nice to have this on Blu Ray.  Billy Wilder is a master.  Gloria Swanson is amazing.  A true classic.

1451695195|4.0|Dr. Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven is by far the most convincing account of heaven that I've ever read, and I've read at least five accounts, including the bestselling Heaven is For Real, Flight to Heaven, and 90 Minutes in Heaven.  As of date, Proof of Heaven still remains #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers List.<br /><br />I am fascinated by the fact that many of these accounts are strikingly similar.  However, I became somewhat of a skeptic myself when I noticed that most of the books I had read on the afterlife were written by ministers, missionaries, or someone affiliated with a church.  To hear an account from someone who didn't believe in God, didn't go to church, and who had no interest in religious matters, made that account far more believable.  In fact Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon who relied on scientific proof to explain the workings of the world.<br /><br />Unexpectedly infected with bacterial meningitis, Dr. Alexander remained in a coma for seven days. By the end of the week, doctors were convinced that he had no chance of waking, and even if he woke, he would never recover.  But one day he wakes up and eventually completely recovers to the astonishment of the medical community.  During the time he is unconscious, he gives a heartfelt account of what happens to him.  Though Dr. Alexander's voice is thoroughly engaging, his time in heaven is described quite generally.  There are no incredible details of heaven.  The most descriptive he gets is when he talks about puffy, pink-white clouds, flocks of transparent orbs, shimmering beings racing across the sky, and people singing and dancing among trees, fields and waterfalls.  God is referred to as Om, and the most vivid character is a girl on a butterfly wing who accompanies him.<br /><br />However, his descriptions of hell are compelling and disturbing.  Here, Dr. Alexander is almost graphic in his details and his report stays with you for some time.  As a reader, you are so sold on his story that you begin to think that hell really does exist, and that maybe it's a good idea to review the Ten Commandments.  He also spends many pages informing the reader on near-death experiences and where his experience fits in that research.  His insights on spirituality and God are alone well worth the read.you begin to think that hell really does exist, and that maybe it's a good idea to review the Ten Commandments.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I can't stop thinking about the story and the protagonist! Reading this book reminded me of how I first fell in love with science fiction, as a child reading my dad's old Heinlein books. I love the science, the descriptions, the humor, the tension, the characters, really everything about The Martian. I really hope Andy Weir continues to write and share his work.
0765325950|5.0|After finishing \\"A Memory of Light\\" last night, I put it on my bookshelf next to it's thirteen companions and had a somber moment. No more new quips from Mat. No more epic feats from Rand. No more Wheel of Time!  What a world Jordan created, and what a monumental task for Brandon Sanderson to take on in the finishing of the series after Jordan's death. All I can say, as an avid fan of the series for the pask decade, is \\"BRAVO\\"! I loved every word of this book, and hated to finish the final page. That's how a book should make you feel. Well done.

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I purchased this game for my 5 year and 7 year old Lego lovers to enjoy a special time with the Lego's. It is a game where you pick from an array of piece and create a design based off the card you chose from the pile and your team opponents have to guess what your designing. I think the game is a great twist to playing and building with Lego's . Only thing is the game comes with approx. 300 Lego's in an array of size and colors and pieces that are specific to the game cards so there isn't much room for free handed  Lego building with the set . Also need to keep track of piece's specific to continue and play the game specified by the rules.
0765325950|5.0|Everything wrapped up beautifully, except for Padan Fain. That felt a bit forced. But just a beautiful conclusion to the series. One of those things that leaves you just a bit melancholy as you ask yourself, \\"Now what?\\"
B000HT3PPG|4.0|There have been several versions made of this story; however, this is the very best!!!  Absolutely love to watch this every year.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I love everything about this movie! It is one of the best girl friend/sister night movie to watch. We all get up and sing and dance and make fools of ourselves.
B00622B3MY|2.0|My son and I love Cars, and so I thought Cars 2 would be of the same quality.  I never expected it to be as violent.  It came out a while ago, so I honestly don't remember the storyline.  Anyway, minus the guns and violence, it was decent.  I think there could have been another movie I would have rather purchased.<br /><br />Deb
B00006JIA4|5.0|Excellent product, I bought it because this set includes a large number of songs from this band that made ​​history.

B008B3GP2A|1.0|This album is sooooo played out. The only reason I bought it is because it was on special for $3.95 download and I liked a few songs on it. I hear the same 3 singles over and over again that I don't even want to listen to it.

B006O6F932|2.0|My daughters ar ein the monster high craze... I thought perfect for Christmas. Its ok overall but definatly needs to be more durable. I dont see it lasting long with having to unfold multiple rooms and the plastic is cheap. The second floor above the caffateria is not well held together. and the stairs keep coming off of it. THe gargouls in front dont stay on the stnads posts whatever. Most of the time it gives us problems trying to open or close it. with in a week our lunch table broke and a desk broke also. Was a pain to figure out all the peices and how to put some of them together. no way to store the table ect.. to save space. Definatly not worth the money if you ask me. I dont expect it to last 4 mths- 6mths. Definatly dont recomend for younge children at all. I love monster high but even the dolls are cheap. I have to keep replacing the dolls because of the removable arms and legs. The parts of the dolls get lost all the time. Very expensive to replace all this stuff.

0425252868|5.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read! Whether you are interested in history, realizing your adversaries are just people like you, an aviator, possible a combat pilot, you owe it to yourself to read this \\"Cant put down\\" story of how our actions can impact so many lives! Awesome book!
0321885112|5.0|Simple yet thorough!  Although a quick and enjoyable read, this book will serve as a good reference for the steps to consider when sketchnoting.  I've always had an artistic flair to my notes, homework, and whiteboard sessions so I was immediately intrigued by this \\"sketchnoting\\" concept.  (I even had a high school physics teacher that appreciated the visual value it provided ... thanks Mr. Fetchko!)  I like how Mike describes all of his processes (mentally and physically) to take the reader on the journey with him as he goes from one step to the next.  Mike also does a great job in decomposing sketches into their basic elements so anyone can master them (with practice).  Great book to get anyone started (or re-started)!
B007IE4DSG|4.0|As a musician i'm always thrilled whenever i find how my favorite composers and songwriters started to create songs. Even though you can hear the final product in different formats (and sometimes it's really different than the one you hear on these kind of albums) there's still something special that makes us wonder when, how and why did he change a riff or a chord structure or how much input was put into the song by someone else. This is one of those albums. George shows us he was a great composer and i'm glad Olivia shares a little bit more of the man in this album. My favorite one here is \\"Awaiting on you all\\". This is one of those special albums you have to hear in a relaxed space. Go buy it and enjoy!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I bought this because the fifteen year old daughter of my good friend said it was the best book she had ever read. I wanted to see what it was about that captured her enthusiasm so.. It's a great book and I think ought to be required reading for adults who have teen aged children. It is engrossing and was nearly impossible to put down.

B0099G6Q5E|5.0|This soundtrack is great; it's the songs from the movie that we all love so much.  The only thing that different is that some songs are longer than in the movie, or else all of the songs would be only a minute long.  Otherwise, just like the movie so, if you love the movie as much as you should, buy the soundtrack(:

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Had to read it to see what the public is buying. Very clever--like a narcissistic person--hooked you with sex, first<br />exciting ,then awful, then boring. The story is clever also---but niave that a troubled girl can help a sicko OCD<br />value-distorted guy with sicko L_O_+V_E, Has all the hooks-money, beauty,extreme sex and a fairy tale story.<br /> The film will be ok as there is an arc to the characters as unbeliveable as it is.<br />  And then I read a book by Tolstoy.....

Seller got it to me quickly, packaging looked legit, product appeared well-made.  Then the disappointment -- the car end of the charger absolutely would NOT fit into the receptacle in my car.  Too big.  Impossible.  Made me wonder if I got a good-looking fake??<br />Seller/Amazon was very good about refunding my money AND the shipping charges I incurred in sending it back to the seller.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Great story, awesome actors, and cool effects. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, yet still causes laughter and fun. Great movie, a must-have.
B005LAII80|5.0|When I saw the initial ads for this movie I was unimpressed and had no desire to go see it. Then I saw this on Amazon and it had quite a large group saying how awesome it was; so I got the movie. Quality was fantastic and the digital copies were easy to redeem. The movie itself however was above and beyond what any typical action movie presents. This was perfectly paced and totally bad ass. 10/10 would watch again.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|There's nothing else a girl needs from time to time than a good romance/musical. I've never seen the Broadway play, but I've always wanted to, especially after seeing this movie. Amazing singers, touching story, great set and cinematography.

B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I have no interest in getting a game that requires me to log in to Facebook so that I can bother my friends with giving them game stuff or getting stuff.  The play was boring.  If you like having to feed things and plant things and build things and bother FB friends, then this is the game for you!  If not, then do not waste your time.

0765325950|1.0|So Harriet McDougal Rigney thinks her husband's legacy is best expressed by where A Memory of Light sits on the top-grossing books list?  Really?  I figured it would more appropriately be enshrined in the quality of his writing, the richness of his story-telling and the fondness of his fans.<br /><br />I'm an American living abroad, and because of my work, half of my time is spent on planes and in hotels.  Not only will I not have access to the latest releases for some time, but I also can't lug around a 1,000 page hardcover book in my laptop bag carry-on either.<br /><br />So, this fan is seriously angry that he has to wait until April to read the final book in the series, and therefore Harriet has achieved the opposite of what she set out to do - diminish her husband's legacy.<br /><br />What a betrayal of the fans.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I went all out with my two most recent computer builds and this CPU went into a new HTPC (and its bigger brother i7 went into my desktop).  I selected the i5 K version to get the high-end Intel graphics engine which out performs add-in gamer video cards in HDTV processing.<br /><br />I have zero stuttering when viewing HDTV in real-time or using the Windows Media Center DVR.<br /><br />I cannot say whether the desktop line (65 watt) is the right way to go for an HTPC.  I see some feedback by those who prefer the low-power Intel Atom cpu alternative but I didn't see anything on Tom's Hardware to help me make the choice.<br /><br />It runs cool enough and the newest Windows and Intel combination handles sleep and hibernate better than ever so I am ok with perhaps burning a few more watts when the system is on.  The CPU is able to adjust its speed up or down depending on load and temperature to help keep energy use low and prolong system life.

B00A6F9YFQ|5.0|Hi All<br />I love buying cdsingles which of course is now getting harder.<br />Most of all Neil and Chris always add great tracks to what we all grew up with as \\"B\\" sides.<br /><br />The three tracks here are a story in themselves. Sometimes the slower songs as these are have the greatest stories and after repeated listenings really grow on you. Very moody and uplifting at the same time.<br /><br />My favourite B side has always been \\"A man Could get Arrested\\" and \\"My Funny Uncle\\" and these three are just as good.<br /><br />If you love the Pet Shop Boys it is great to collect their cdsingles.  :)

1449433251|5.0|THis is an amazing collection of all the Calvin and Hobbes comics ever written.  It includes an introduction about the author and his works dating from 1985.  My 25-year old son (a major fan) and I love the collection.  Four volumes on very good quality paper.  The four volumes in a sturdy case make it a challenge to lift.
B007MU85D0|3.0|I enjoyed the music and found it easy to listen to but as most of the songs sound alike it I found it rather bland.
0761163808|5.0|We enjoy scanimation books because they are amazing, but this is incredible! If you can imagine watching a video on a page, that is what you'll see in this book about Safari animals. The movements of the animals are perfect in detail, some are awesome and others funny. My kids really like this book!!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This movie is a gem. It is a little bit artsy (read relaxed paced, dry wit, fantastic dialogue.) it is heart-warming and lovely. Recommend to anyone who prefers to be entertained subtly.

If your looking for a book on making goals, learning the basics about nurtirtion along with basic definitions, this is a book for you.  If you looking for a more exercise based book this is not for you.  I do want to metion it had a great cutting and bulking diet, that I found pretty interesting.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Susan Boyle was a &#34;late comer&#34; to the industry before being discovered singing on a Simon Cowell produced British television show.  She mesmerized the audience and the judges with her version of a Les Miserables classic and the rest is history.  These songs are very familiar, they just needed to be &#34;Boyled&#34; Wonderful music!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I cannot sleep when its completely quiet.

B009IQG5LK|4.0|Ah, the summer of 1990, memories of the hype surrounding Warren Beatty's Disney financed comic strip movie homage to Chester Gould's creation. 22 years later, the film looks great on blu-ray and strangely does not seem dated at all due to its 1930s setting and amazing production design. I noticed many details in the background of scenes that I had never noticed before. The tombstones in the cemetery scene have the names \\"Smith\\" and \\"Jones\\" on them blending in with the generic nature of all the businesses, cars, products etc. in the film. Madonna's tears in more than one scene are clearly visible now as well as her curves in crystal clear definition. The many cameos are dazzling, Charlie Korsmo is charismatic as The Kid and it turns out that The Blank was really played by the same thespian that played another character, you can see the height of the character is the same as another one! The storyline is convoluted but also very simple in that comic strip way and the overacting by most of the cast fits in with the cartoonish nature of the presentation. Oscar nominations and wins for the Stephen Sondheim, Madonna crooned blues song \\"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)\\", art direction and makeup - all well deserved. Controversial movie, loved by some and hated by others. I can see what Beatty was trying to accomplish and I think he succeeds for the most part. No extras on the blu-ray release, I guess wounds have not healed between Beatty and Disney. On another high note, \\"I'm Breathless\\", the full length album recorded by Madonna and inspired by her character in the movie, is top notch. Had more of her songs been included in the final cut of the film, it would have given it a bit more \\"oomph\\" and humor!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This DVD has amazing visual clarity! -- It is top quality and anyone purchasing WON'T be disappointed in the quality of this Blu-ray!!!
B00APUQT7I|1.0|The movie never even started. It just gave the logo and then it would turn off. I tried various times and nothing worked. First time I have been let down my instant video.
B009JBZH54|3.0|Multiple sources around the internet confirm that The Dark Knight Trilogy Ultimate Collector's Edition will be released sometime in 2013. If you are a big fan of the series, I would recommend waiting. There are also unofficial reports floating around that a batch of this boxed set was shipped out with The Dark Knight Rises disc missing, and replaced by a duplicate extras disc. This is believed to be isolated, and no longer a problem. The digital copy is also reported to be glitchy and basically useless. Discs are also without a Main menu. While this feature is nice because there are previews, it also prevents you from being able to \\"resume\\" where you left off, on a later date. Buy the discs separately, or wait for the Ultimate Collector's Edition.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is my favorite out of any movie I have seen or of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is so easy to like, Thorin (Richard Armitage) fits the part perfectly... I love the way he talks; the dwarves are all hilarious (Fili, Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Ori, Dori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Balin, and Dwalin); Lady Galadriel is ethereal, Gandalf is grey (incredible), and the cast fits all of the characters to a tee. LOVE THIS MOVIE!
B000HC2LI0|3.0|The DVDs are perfect and everything about it is amazing, except by the time I was checking it out the back had become completely unglued. I can see where all the glue is but it isn't attached to the DVD holder anymore.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I loved this movie has a connection with aliens - must buy in my opinion so I'd recommend it any day of the week
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I totally love this, you can download it on your phone and save the videos. You can later hear them as MP3....i needed something like this and for sure i recommend this product.
B00902MCX2|5.0|First of all, let me say, pardon the length of this review. I never write them this long, and I don't think I will again, but I was just struck by inspiration from this album. Time I blew me away. And although yes, the \\"metal\\" factor is significantly lessened from the debut, Time is a beautiful musical work of art.<br /><br />Case<br />First of all, before I mention the songs, the casing itself looks great. The artwork is beautiful and it fits the mood of the album, and inside the front cover is the CD itself, sporting the same picture of the tree coming out of a head. Then, attached to the inner spine is the lyric book, and I must say that I love when artists don't just slap the lyrics on but actually make them look good and interesting, and Time I accomplishes this greatly. The fonts are all the same as the \\"Time I\\" logo on the cover and superimposed over backgrounds of frozen landscapes, cosmic storms and more, and it also contains a beautiful quality picture of each member of the band individually and one of them together in front of violet, star-dotted clouds. At the end, on the inner back cover is the DVD, bearing the same eyes of the cover, but darker and being flanked by with purple tendrils. On the back the motif is the same, the iconic tree surrounded by swirls of energy and purple flames, looking almost like a mystical forest on an alien planet. Superimposed over this scene is the setlist as well as the DVD information.<br /><br />Songs<br />1. When Time Fades Away<br />The instrumental intro track, reminiscent of the Ensiferum albums. A light rain accompanied by soft violins and what sounds like a Japanese harp and woodwinds. This builds up, adding more layers for a minute until everything quiets for a brief moment and then with an unexpected drop, the whole orchestra jumps into a musical adventure complete with epic tribal drums, swaying and flying through a magical land until at around three minutes, after building up power, it is released in another heart-stopping drop punctuated by violins that erupts into a frenzy of melodic power that drops the jaw. After a bit of this, it suddenly stops. Not abruptly, but the orchestra is silenced and we are returned to the woodwinds, harp and violins of the beginning. The soft music then seamlessly transitions-<br /><br />2. Sons Of Winter And Stars<br />I. Rain Of Stars<br />-into the next song, much like this sentence. The acoustic sound continues with a slight change of melody and is unexpectedly rocked by power chords and then the metal kicks in. Same melody, but with guitars and Kai blasting away. After a bit, the orchestra quiets, and a choir heralds the arrival of Jari's screams. This pattern continues, orchestrations and metal harmonizing wonderfully with an angelic soprano hovering over it all, Jari screaming through a storm of furious melody.<br />II. Surrounded By Darkness<br />The music lowers to introduce the second sequence. Ambient sounds and guitar feedback fall into a heavy, dark riff and Kai joins with his double bass and toms, and then the orchestra jumps aboard. This riff is continued as Jari sings and screams his way, accompanied by the death growls of bassist Jukka, voices overlapping in a chilling manner. The dark riff continues storming along until it gives way to more epic melodic power with Jari's clean vocals until it is suddenly stopped my intense violins.<br />III. Journey Inside A Dream<br />Personally, one of my favorite parts on the album. The power chords give way to slow violins and rhythmic, swaying acoustic strumming and Jari sings in a beautiful voice that takes the listener into the sky with such glorious, uplifting melody, hitting every note with such satisfying accuracy. Then the strumming dies down giving way to an ethereal sequence of overlapping voices, seemingly falling through a hole of darkness until...<br />IV. Sons Of Winter And Stars<br />Right before impact, there is a one second warning of Jari screaming the first two wordsof the chorus. Just as the listener's eyes open in realization of what is coming, a maelstrom explodes, filled with a righteous fury as Jari screams through the chorus, followed by a repetition of the same chorus with clean vocals. The raging music continues until there is what appears to be a dual solo, exchanging between violins and guitars, and then there is a flashback in time as the main melody of \\"Rain of Stars\\" returns for a brief moment, and then there is a breakdown of Jari singing a duet with a choir for a bit and then the blast beats enter, and Jari sings a few more lines until the chorus returns with a vengeance, this time with a full Nordic choir that flows into the final stretch with amazing guitar work which culminates into a final, grand climax. Hands down, the best song on the album.<br /><br />3. Land Of Snow And Sorrow<br />The third track opens with a slow guitar riff complemented by synths and strings, and is soon joined by slow drumming, power chords and full choir and orchestra, giving the feeling of a wanderer journeying through a treacherous frozen world. Jari begins to sing, cleanly, and is soon joined by other ambient voices, creating a whirlwind of voices. This slow, deliberate tempo is continued into and past the chorus, where Jari's clean voice is harmonized in a lovely way. After a few minutes, he begins to scream a few lines, until the chorus returns. The general sound and speed of the song is the same for the length of it, but it does not sound repetitive, as he changes it up with some bridges and minor melodic shifts, and it works because unlike Sons Of Winter And Stars, which is made to tell a story that changes over time like Starchild from the debut album, this song is meant to give a singular feeling, of melancholy and isolation, in the same style as Sleeping Stars.<br /><br />4. Darkness And Frost<br />Track four flows seamlessly between the previous and following songs, in the same fashion as the first two songs. Except instead of being the intro to one song, it is the bridge between two. It is the shortest song, and appropriately so since it is meant as a transitionary point. The song opens with a faint guitar riff in the background and is brought swiftly to the forefront a small drop. The sound is livelier than Land Of Snow And Sorrow, with a nice swaying rhythm, sounding like what I call a \\"Space Waltz\\". The melody is consistent, building up energy with more synth and orchestration layers until Time begins.<br /><br />5. Time<br />The final song begins with the same tune as the predecessor, but instantly kicks off with power chords and drums. The same swaying waltz melody plays for a while until it is slowed into a bridge of oriental violins and a twinkling melody until the rhythm returns with a scream from Jari. After a few measures, the orchestrations dim to let the guitars do most of the work as Jari begins screaming the first verse, which leads into the chorus, where the orchestrations return in force as Jari's clean voice delivers a lovely accompaniment to the cosmic dance of power that is Time. After a small bridge of fast riffs and violin arpeggios, the band kicks in with a faster tempo, with a variation on the waltz theme from the first part of the song. Jari screams the second chorus while accompanied by Jukka's death growls, and this is followed by more fast riffs punctuated by an angelic choir. The following section quiets the guitars in favor of a more melodic sound with where Jari sings another bridge with overlapping ethereal voices that lead into an epic solo, and then returning to the main chorus. Afterwards begins the final stretch with the faster melody giving one last, long burst of furious energy as Jari and Jukka scream as Time fades away. The instruments cease with the main melody being played furiously on piano alone, and soon this fades into the release of a sweet jumble of notes being played by some strings and woodwinds with an oriental flair, reminiscent ofthe intro track. And so Time comes to a close.<br /><br />DVD<br />The DVD is admittedly less than I expected. Before Time I was released I also purchased Ensiferum's \\"Unsung Heroes\\", the special edition which also had a DVD, this one with almost two hours of behind-the-scenes documentaries and accompanying the band throughout recording the album. Whereas Wintersun's was interesting, it didn't really delve too much into the writing and recording process. The DVD includes: 1) The band performing each song (minus the intro, which is purely computer made) live in a rehearsal studio, which was interesting but nothing really new. 2) Licks and Tricks, where each band member individually has a video of them demonstrating a part of the album on their particular instrument. Curiously, the members whose vidoes were the most informative were Jukka and Kai, the bassist and the drummer, Kai's being the most in-depth. They actually demonstrated how they came up with their parts and explained some of the playing and writing process, where Teemu did little of this, and Jari actually only spoke to talk about his gear before just playing through two sections of song. 3) This is a long section of Jari with an interviewer in what appears to be his apartment demonstrating all the tracks of Sons Of Winter And Stars on his computer, explaining a bit of how he wrote the many, many orchestrations that accompany the band. 4) The last section is a montage of pictures of the band in several stages of making the album. There are pictures of them in the studio, at press releases and on tour. All in all, I expected to see more new material. Not new songs or anything, just more of the production history. I know there are a lot of fans who would like to see how Jari came up with the songs or watch the band record them.<br /><br />Final Verdict<br />Needless to say, I love this album. It is a different approach than the debut, with more emphasis on the orchestral sound, with less attention to the blazing speeds of songs like \\"Beyond the Dark Sun\\", \\"Winter Madness\\", or \\"Starchild\\". Which, after taking a few listens of Time I, I am actually happy for. I hear too many people commenting on how a band's new material all sounds the same (Which, honestly applies to any artist. After all, it's their style. Also, if they're good, is never a bad thing. Why wouldn't you want more of a good thing?) But new material is also a good direction, and Wintersun did not disappoint. And while I can understand the desire to hear more of what made me fall in love with the band in the first place, \\"Sons of Winter and Stars\\" has plenty of speed and is quite long so it doesn't feel like it's too brief. And this new album is not meant to replace the original. If you want to hear a faster Wintersun, the debut is still there, and those songs are still amazing and will never get old. And, lastly and most important, this is only half the album. Part II is coming out in 2013, and if what I have heard is correct, Jari saved the best songs for the second act. He even said in an interview that \\"Silver Leaves\\" is his favorite song he's written ever, and I personally can't wait to hear it. Also, there is the live recordings of \\"Way of the Fire\\" on YouTube, and if you've seen it you know there's more speed to come. So, with a beautiful case, rather interesting DVD, and this new blood injected in the Wintersun sound and with the knowledge that the second half is on its way to complete Time, I would award it a 9.5 out of 10, just because the DVD didn't show much new material. But since the scale is out of 5, I happily award this masterpiece a 5/5, and I eagerly await the second coming of Jari to bless my ears with his heavenly music.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love the fact you can change the sounds to whatever you want. It helps me relax and take everything off my mind. just relax aahh :)
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Enjoyed the music but the movie itself was a little cheesy. Not sure if that was the intent, but it was still ok.<br />There were some funny moments in it, which seemed to erase the slowness of the movie. Tom Cruise did a great job of portraying an &#34;out-of-it&#34; rock star. His character was the most intense of all of them, even though he spoke in a low, mumbling voice.

B006X5L6VS|1.0|Too hard to use. Not userfriendly. No instructions for using. Can't tell if I am actually looking in the right direction.<br />Would not order this.
B000FC10WU|3.0|Although the story line is interesting enough, the writing style is somewhat ho-hum. It certainly doesn't grab you at the first sentence and make you want to continue reading. I haven't finished the book and so don't know how unique the solution to the crime is, but I'm not expecting anything mind blowing.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I am a fan of Anthony and this is my second time reading this book. Wildly funny, disturbingly dark, always entertaining.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Very interesting story line. More twists and turns that I would have expected. I work for attorneys and found the characters quite believable.

B000YMM3CC|5.0|By far one of the best love stories I have ever seen.  The acting by all stars was superb...Ryan Gosling and Gena Rowlands was exceptional.  A must see if you are a fan of this genre'...it will bring tears to your eyes.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I don't know what I expected, but what I got was a thoroughly engrossing story from beginning to end. I so enjoyed the&#34; language of flowers&#34; which the author so neatly wove into it. As Oprah says,&#34;Everyone has a story&#34; and each of these characters has one, so well told by the author. The flowers are a character unto themselves, as they communicate in their fashion.  I understand why the movie was called &#34;Steel Magnolias&#34;! I enjoyed  this book so much, that I gave it as a gift.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Just a simple game to take the edge off of the daily grind. Sometimes its just fun to play and relax.
B007SGM084|5.0|Did not know much about this book but knew it was being read by alot of people. I felt like I was reading someones diary and felt naughty, but OH MY what changes it brought forth for my husband and I.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This was a wonderful buy. The person receiving this as a gift is a 17yoa male, fancy that. He absolutely loves his new controller. Thanks for the quick shipping time.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler is rather large in my opinion but it works great probably because of it. Installed it on an FX-8120 on a Gigabyte mobo in an Antec 300 case. A little Arctic Silver paste and I have no worries about heat. This is one of the most popular cpu coolers for a reason...it works. And it does it damn well and cheaply to boot. Get one for a worry free build or factory replacement. You won't be sorry. The picture on Amazon that I'm looking at for this product shows two fans installed on the radiator. It comes with only one. Don't be misled into thinking it will have two when you get it, although you can purchase and install another one for push pull airflow if desired. I, so far, haven't found it necessary to install another fan.
0786955570|4.0|My friends and I are trying to get into the DnD world, and this game is doing a great job drawing us in.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This was used in a new desktop build and on an AMD bulldozer cpu which can draw quite a few watts and get VERY warm. So I got a Coolermaster Hyper 212 Plus, slapped some Arctic Silver on the cpu and now I'm golden. No worries about heat. Even playing intense games or encoding video I haven't had it over 55 or 60 degrees C. Idles at 25 C. Arctic Silver is a must purchase along with a good aftermarket cooler. Great product.

1401324517|4.0|A huge fan! And it was a great read.  The Federer-Nadal 2008 Wimbledon finals was one of the best matches in history and getting an inside look to Rafa's mindset at the time was an amazing read.
B0053TMP24|5.0|In this book I found out that Percy has found a new Roman camp with the help of Juno that goes by the name 'Camp Jupiter'.  He is expected to help save the camp from an upcoming attack by the giants. But he was swiped of his memory by Juno in her Greek form Hera and the only memory he has of his old life is his girlfriend Annabeth.<br /><br />My favorite part in this book was when he help his newly found friends  Frank Zhang and Hazel Levesque clear the bad reputation of the fifth cohort.<br /><br />If there was and part of this book that I didn't like it would be the fact that it tells you the story in a narrative point of view instead of the character's point of view.<br /><br />I genuinely hope they make these books into movies, I would own all of them on DVD and sit around watching them every weekend.
B004I744AS|4.0|I've been looking for a good dictionary for a while. This fits the bill to a &quot;T&quot;.  A fine addition to my Kindle Fire. I Would recommend it unreservedly.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|In this book Percy and his friends have to over come plenty of difficulties to complete their quest in order to save the world and Olympus from destruction by Gaea and her helpers.<br /><br />I favored the romance between not only Percy and Annabeth. But also between Jason and Piper as well as Frank and Hazel.<br /><br />I was not happy with the fact that the end of the book was a 'cliff-hanger' and I found out the next book doesn't come out until fall.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A little glitchy, but overall a good game. Storyline was interesting, and the puzzles were moderate in difficuly, I would pay for a sequel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The amount of tears I shed throughout this book, I never by thought that would be possible. Ifelt like I was falling in love with peeta!!!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|The movie was funny. I like Mark and when I like an actor the movie has to be real bad for me not to like it. Or the actor looks real horrible. Like Tom Cruise with really long hair - eee[...] Don't do it Tom. Same goes for Brad Pitt. Don't grow your hair out. Take it from a gay woman - You guys look horrible with long hair. I can't even watch your movies when you have long hair.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|I fell in love with cinema when I was 5 years old and that love affair remains as fresh as ever now I'm 71. I mention this because that should give me some street cred, even if it is only based on long experience. I've seen most of the movies that people talk about, rave about and; as in the case of Heaven's Gate, unjustly abuse. Mostly I agree with film critics. Mostly, not always. But this movie. This movie is one of the finest pieces of cinematic art I've ever seen and I've seen it quite a few times.<br />It tells such a terrific story in such a profound way and so beautifully crafted; flawless even. Each time it gets better.<br /><br />So why has it been given such a hard time? I think it's because the story it has to tell is too near the truth for some people to feel comfortable with. Prejudice and inhumanity which some would wish to conveniently forget about. As a foreigner born and bred in the UK, perhaps I can be forgiven for thinking that some of those people were extremely influential when Heaven's Gate was first set for release and could conceivably have actively taken steps to prevent its distribution, let alone its chances of success.<br /><br />Now I've seen the movie again in the wonderful blu-ray process/format, it still leaves me breathless with the wonder at<br />its scale and scope and its sumptuous production values.<br /><br />My favourite movies include other masterpieces - Citizen Kane, naturally. The Godfather, of course. Bicyle Thieves (and other non US classics). High Noon, Amadeus, Smoke and so on. I mention these to give a flavour of my taste in this unequalled art form so that I can bludgeon any cynic out there (metaphorically speaking of course) into acknowledging that Heaven's Gate is unequalled; a stand alone jewel of cinema. It survives in spite of the fiercest opposition. Have that!!
B004XVN1T4|3.0|Not Follett's finest work, but worth the read especially @ the kindle price. Some nail bitting moments, but the historical points hard to follow.
B004KPX5GC|5.0|I was reluctant to rent this as I thought that there was no way it could even remotely compare to Seabiscuit. I was wrong. It's really hard for me to say that I like Seabiscuit better, but I probably do, but not by much. They are both sensational.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This continuation of the Outlander series is just as good as the first book!  I couldn't put it down!  The author blends true history with the fiction of Claire and Jamie seamlessly. A must read!
1439181780|5.0|This book has changed my life , my relationship with people ! Thank you Rhonda Byrne for showing me the positive way of thinking !
B003O86FMW|5.0|Held me captivate and kept me guessing. Great book! I recommend it to anyone seeking adventure. I cannot wait to see the movie.
0765325950|5.0|A great end to the series!  I never would have believed a 500 page battle would be so engrossing. Brandon is great at making fight scenes come alive with detail & making the characters real enough to bring tears to my eyes with their triumphs and their tragedies.<br /><br />I will read anything Sanderson writes!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this app on my phone and was very hapy to find it in the apps for my tablet.  Would recommend this to all.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun, easy to play. Fantastic graphics. G5 continues to put out great games &amp; I&acute;m looking forward to trying more of their games.
B0096PYUE2|4.0|Not exactly sure what this is but I'm sure it's great! If I figure it out will recommend it to all.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great app.Very addictive. Can't put it down once you start.Plenty of levels to keep you going for hours on end.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This free app for the game of solitaire is ok. The ads are distracting but then it's free. I would recommend buying it instead of just going for the free one.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Being Irish & American and growing up with stories of the &#34;old country&#34; and how blessed we are to be Irish, it was eye opening to learn the true experience of the Irish.  It was also very humbling for me to think of the things we take for granted like electricity, plumbing, beds, clean clothes and food. He tells it all with humor, so you don't find yourself crawling to bed from depression after each chapter.  I loved this book and shall read all three.  I'm looking forward to starting &#34;Tis&#34;.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I think there is a bit of Harold in all of us.  Though my life is in no way like Harold's I found myself connecting to his struggles and getting carried away with his pilgrimage - taking the first big step, overcoming obstacles, sticking to the journey through thick and thin, and breaking through the crap that life deals.  I was cheering for him to succeed - it was a very touch story and probably in my top few books of the year.
B000PMG16U|5.0|What can I saw about a movie trilogy that's been out for a while and that pretty much every American has seen, that hasn't been said before? Well, probably not a thing... LOL. This trilogy shares the story you don't don't see in the first three movies, but see what's hinted at. The first one is a bit slow, but after you watch the next two the dots are connected & you'll enjoy the whole series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really can't wait for the movie!!  Suzanne Collins continues the drama with emotion and excitement.  Once again, I couldn't put it down!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|What is there to say about classic Star Wars that hasn't been said before? I grew up with the trilogy, remember watching the second one in the drive in and falling asleep in the back seat. It's one of the best geeky series out there and a must own for any sci-fi person.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I purposefully waited until all the Harry Potter movies were released so that I could buy a complete set. I don't regret buying this set at all, because I mainly just wanted to own the movies, I was slightly disappointed that there were no (and I mean NO) special features whatsoever. I wasn't expecting hours long SF, but I thought each movie would come with at least one SF. Also, I don't know whether it's a special setting, but each of the movies started automatically playing after a certain amount of time on the DVD main menu screen, even when the movie had been watched already. Again, not a major complaint, just an observation.<br /><br />All in all, I like that the set is small and doesn't take up an entire DVD shelf, but this is most definitely only the set for you if you want the movies and nothing else. There is nothing 'collectable' about it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Like it always happens... most apps work flawlessly for the iPhone platform but it is not the same story for androids.<br /><br />I loved to use this app on my iPhone because I can choose different version of the bible in Spanish.<br /><br />Then I got myself a Nexus 7 Tablet and tried to use this app, but it would not let me switch to the Spanish version.<br /><br />Than I wrote an email to YourVersion, and a couple of days later I received a respond to download the app again, and the new version now does work correctly on my Nexus 7, I can now read the bible in spanish nice and big...
B007SGM084|2.0|Not impressed by this book at all. The story was lacking in elements. Like character or story it contained way to much sex.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Its just a normal FB app. It has all the standard features. Sometimes i have issues with loading newer posts and it mixes older posts into my news feed but that is easily fixed with a quick reboot of the app.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My only problem is I don't have friends that play this so I lose out on safari help<br />But it is fun and love the graphics
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great Kindle solitaire app. I don't need the fancy bells and whistles it takes care of business and when you're working graveyard at a gas station that's all you need.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a very fascinating book.  There is a lot of crap out there<br />about taking down Bin Laden, but Owen has the real stuff.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is a awesome book for kids like me. I love all the diary of a wimpy kid books. This is a good book
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always enjoy a game of solitare. Passes the time and keeps the brain working. Recommend to those who enjoy solitare.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play Solitaire with a deck of cards so when I seen I could play it on my Kindle Fire I jumped at the chance!I love this app and I would recommend it to others!
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This I absolutely LOVE. Using this tool, I have a handle on what I can expect while traveling to other parts of the world. MOST useful! ( I hate traveling in cyclones/hurricanes and the like).I also appreciate being able to know what the time is elsewhere in the world, so i don't call people there in the middle of their night.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's twitter what more can I say?!Great app works perfect I can't complain!I love this app and I would recommend it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Characters were well developed and story was suspenseful.  I read it in a day and half because I could not put it down.  One of my new favorites!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|A must read for all true vampire fans<br />Takes a little persistence to get use to the old English words
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because this book takes real world problems today and brings them into a futuristic world. I personally liked this entire book. I would recommend this book to anyone definitely older than 13 at the youngest.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written novel with a story that is completely believable, given what can and does happen on any given day. That said, I was completely surprised by the ending.
0765325950|5.0|A great conclusion to the series. Very satisfying ending with a couple of unexpected twists and turns.  Of course there are always a few details/subplots that could have been explained more fully but all in all I am very happy with the concluding story.  A really awesome job by Mr. Sanderson
B000V63BN6|4.0|One forgets the great songs recorded by Stevie Wonder until they listen to this collection.  There is not a bad song in the collection in my opinion.  Some are the best songs ever recorded.
0701171081|4.0|I love this cookbook, and its great author. I have tried several recipes already, and they turn out great. Just be sure to get the Chatto & Windus (London) published edition with metric measurements (and convert on your own if you need to) as the chatter is that the US edition has had poor conversions and inconsistent results.<br /><br />I can't wait until I am finished with my diet, so I can try out a few more recipes !!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I almost put this one down for good a couple of times in the beginning, but had hopes it would get better. It did. It wasn't my favorite Kate Morton book, but still a good book overall.
039925045X|4.0|Bought this for an International school overseas to help teach English to elementary school kids. The Kids and Teachers love it. The giant size edition allows the teacher to hold it up and the whole class to see.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I have now read all Kate Morton's books and am a big fan. The Forgotten Garden was probably my favorite.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|does everything you could want. great value for the price. love using it. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a battery app.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Yet another gripping book from Grisham. The legal intricacies kept me spellbound. This book is worth a read for all interested in thrillers but more so those involved in the criminal justice system.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game. Loved it. Love that it is free. I think everyone should download it and give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 6yo son loves this game!  It keeps him entertained and he enjoys challenging others on it.  I have it on my iphone as well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Chomsky really addresses and tackles issues teens face now without sugar coating it. He is honest in his approach, and his style is fantastic.  It truly feels like Charlie is writing to you
B002BWP49M|3.0|I bought it as a gift for my friend. It is one of her favorite movie series. It is a great film for any twilight fan.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I loved this book.  Thor, the main character exhibits what most of us probably aspire to--authenticity.  He consistency makes decisions based on his own inner guidance rather than any outer authority.  As a result, he lives an amazing life.  Don't miss this one!
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I've had this turntable about a month. Been so busy listening to old albums, that I haven't even used the software yet (so I can't review it). The sound is great plugged into my Sony component system after a little tweeking with the equalizer. I would recommend this turntable to someone looking for a reasonably priced quality turntable.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Every day I come up with new uses for this thing. I go out of town a lot but SPLASHTOP lets me stay on top of my office business, as well as doing PC maintenance while miles away from my computer.
1401322786|4.0|i took this on my vacation in Mexico last year, this was a nice deep read, lovely, romantic and sad at the end. Not realising what you have lost till it is gone is a sad realization of any kind. Enjoy this small novel read and remember the content.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Download very good quality. I enjoyed it. A lot of music to choose from with a lot of different artists.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A funny but honest look at 2 people dealing with the reality of living with mental illness. I love Pat!
1400079276|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I think I'm finally going to start reading fiction regularly again now that I've tried a couple of Japanese authors. Japanese writers seem to demand more of their readers than American authors do. If you're looking for a typical storyline, this book is definitely not the one you want to choose. There are three entirely separate stories with different protagonists and physical contexts. One is even set fifty years before the other two.  Murakami alternates between these three stories, picking up where he left off with each one at the beginning of the chapters. Eventually it becomes only two stories, but all the plots do not converge until near the end of the book.<br /><br />Also, I'm beginning to see that some Japanese authors seem to share the predilection of many Japanese animated filmmakers when they use the superstitious beliefs embedded in historical folk tales as plot devices to move the story forward in unusual and sometimes seemingly ambiguous ways. There are parts in the latter half of this book where it's never clearly explained where physical reality ends and the realm of daydreams begins. The reader simply has to sketch out both possibilities in his mind and enjoy sucking the marrow out of the themes that would be implied by both options.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Parts of the book seemed to jump around and it took several pages to find out what was really going on.
B00AYDC3CG|1.0|It the movie was out in 2012 and in black and white, white a joke.  Why have it in HD Tim, maybe we should have it in vhs to. Lol  The black and white did nothing for this movie at all, the movie was just look ever Tim Burton movie , the boy in the movie is just a small version of the guy the made in corpes bride even the guy next store is from corpes bride. Tim uses the same s*** in all his movies from people,looks,feel,storys,endings and even music. He is in love with Johnny and makes his cartoons look like him all the time. This movie sucks.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|and it is surprising how crime really pays, thorough research and detailing, with constatnt sprinkling of suspence and excitement, makes it very readable.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Movie is great and does not kill the first dredd with Stallone and was not the same story. Yes some of the movie look was from the Stallone movie but it is Dredd so that will happen just like Batman movies. I give it 4 stars then 5 star just becuase the guy that plays dredd tries to act like Stallone and do the Stallone face with some Stallone movements which kill the movie a little, if you can get passed that the movie is great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book! Plenty of twists and surprises. Suspenseful and entertaining. Intelligently written. Best book I've read in recent memory, hands down!
B007PVHANM|5.0|Got it as a xmas present for a fan who happens to be a huge Marley fan. He loved it and I the props for picking it up. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet, you need to pick this one up
0764141201|5.0|This is the best book I've ever found to aid in teaching and practicing phrasal verbs.  I also work in longer idiomatic expressions.  It provides complete explanations and grammar exercises so the student understands each and every definition and practices them in sentences.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love how simple and easy this app is and i use it faithfully for pictures to email. So smart.
