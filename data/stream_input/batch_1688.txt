B008QTV3X0|5.0|Gripping show - only complaint with the \\"premium\\" networks is that they don't release on streaming like AMC and others as shows come out.  Just charge more for them if you are Showtime / HBO...  instead - have to wait for another year to find out what happens...  which you will do if you watch this series!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It usually takes me a couple of weeks to read a book, but this was a very quick read (2 days). The characters are well developed. I really wanted to know more about their lives. Lots of good life lessons in this story. But what would you expect from the author of Tuesdays With Morrie?
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I would give this DVD six or seven stars if Amazon gave me the option.  This DVD contains over two hours of great music from my favorite singer/composer.  It was good to see Julie Christensen and Perla Batalla again.  I fell in love with Leonard Cohen's unique style in the 1960's, and pleasantly watched as his style matured over the years.  This DVD is the culmination of a lifetime of creating truly original music.  I also bought Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man.  That was a big disappointment because the whole show was other singers singing Leonard's songs as a tribute to him.  I would like to see someone put Leonard Cohen's appearance on Austin City Limits on DVD. Fantastic performance!
B003VS0CYC|5.0|Robocop is the man. Grew up watching these movies as a kid and still to this date love watching these movies especially the original which is the best of the Trilogy. If you haven't seen them yet, make it a movie night.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was a bit tedious at times to have to venture between locations within the game to collect all the items needed.  But, overall I thought it was awesome!  I couldn't put it down!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great for taking notes.I use this app to take notes while in church. Only wish I could have this app and my bible app open on screen at the same time.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|There are answers in this book.  Yet this is different from the individual life that each reader must live to discover, uncover, recover its own answer. 5 stars would leap from the page to the psyche.<br /><br />The recounting is a good, effective report of another person's journey.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This novel is a collection of stories that all tie together in the end. The first is an \\"Old English\\" style, the time frame moves forward to modern and into the post-apocalyptic where the writting becomes difficult to read again because of the imagined lexicon of the times. I may have given up after the first story if this book had not been reccomended by a friend. Hang in there, this book is worth the effort.
B007KL8Z40|5.0|Ane Brun created a wonderful CD.<br />The songs are very worthwhile listening to.<br />They are creative and original.<br />It is hard to compare them to any other singer-songwriter.<br />I strongly recommend this CD to every music lover.<br />Hans - Rotterdam - Holland
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A very well crafted love story I couldn't put it down this is a book where you miss the characters  as soon as you finish ... i would love to read more
B00785P2QC|5.0|I play this game all the time. I play it so much I had to force myself to stop playing to write this review. that is how much fun this game is.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book. The writing was excellent and the story enthralling. I found myself staying up much later than I intended because I wanted/had to continue reading. I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to read happens next in this very captivating series.  I will most definitely be buying and reading more books by Hugh Howey.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|movie was fast paced, grabbed your attention from the start. editing was good...acting was especially good and very little redundant content. i would watch again, and i think if you rent a movie from amazon, they should create a history for you so if you wanted to rent it a second time, it would be 1.99 HD, rather than paying full price again. what about it amazon, how about gratutity for your faithful customers?
B00932HCG6|5.0|Warning - YOU WILL GET HOOKED! This is a awesome show, very engaging and lots of plot twists, and very well acted.
B007TMON8M|5.0|this game is fun and challenging hdhduehb djdnd Jd. dj he j djbfj ie diiwo qkwj dj rich :uhff rjxo
B009PEKRY6|5.0|I am very impressed with the writing and composition of these songs! Whoever writes and composes these songs is a genius!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good first person creative game.  You can play in creative mode (you have everthing you need to build, no monsters).  You can play in survival mode (you have to find the resources while avoiding monsters).  You can also turn off monsters in peaceful mode, you still have to find the resources, but you don't have to deal with the monsters.  You don't really ever 'Win' you just continue to build a better world.  Nice landscapes from mountains, caves, waterfalls, water, and sand.  Can't wait for the updates to this game, it can only get better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! May have enjoyed it as much as \\"50 Shades\\". I can't wait until May 2013 for book #3!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick Riordan delivered again in the Mark of Athena. After a long wait all the characters from the heroes of Olympus have come together in a well balanced piece. One of the only criticisms I had of the book was the annoying tendency Rick Riordan has to always save his characters never letting them lose a battle or be hurt majorly in any way. THe only book that was different from this was the last olympian. Besides this flaw I found Mark of Athena engaging and exciting and a definite must read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book at a time when i couldn't get into anything.  The writing style, characterization, and subject of the book were all great.  I could not put it down and it was fun listening to the music mentioned throughout.  Can't wait to see the movie now.  I would recommend this for YA and adults
B007PVHANM|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my niece who is 27.  She encouraged my sister and I to watch it before we mailed it to her in NY.  She and I truly enjoyed Marley's music but were amazed to learn about his very humble beginnings and all of the political unrest in Jamaica (didn't know about it).  Really made me appreciate Bob Marley the man and peacemaker as well as his amazing music!  A must for anyone who only loves the music, let's you really get inside the man (a very amazing man at that).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book, and as a science fiction fan starting in elementary school, I've read a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction.  I recommend this book for seasoned readers as well as for those just starting out in the genre.  It should make publishers sit up and take notice.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I Loved this book....Wasn't as steamy or hot as Bared to You was but just as Heart pounding and if that is what gets you started on a book then I suggest this is the Book for you!!! so can't wait for her next one to come out!!!
B0096PAA6E|3.0|Teased for so long, Gary Clark Jr., thank you for finally issuing this album. I have played the Bright Lights CD over so many times, waiting for this album to be released. And then it arrives and oh darn it; this is a mangled mess of an album. There are songs on here that make me want to tear my ears out and never listen to music again, and then there are masterpieces that I can listen to a million times. To me, this should have been two albums - a beautiful hard-core rock / blues album that drives hard, and an over produced pop album (and throw in maybe a little nod to the 50's Rock Around The Clock crowd).<br /><br />This album is a download, not buy. If your tastes run the same direction as his Bright Lights EP, the preview clips do an excellent job showing which tracks are in that same direction and which are the pop tracks to avoid. On the other hand, if pop music is something you love, well avoid those harder tracks and enjoy funk, rock, and 50's music.<br /><br />The album is a mystery of contrasts and not necessarily put together to listen from track one to thirteen. Yes, 80's funk and urban music has their roots in the blues. But putting John Legend style smooth next to the hard-edged blues song Bright Lights just makes no sense at all. And I will forever scratch my head over how somebody could put a hard-core Delta Blues song on this album. Maybe it will introduce this blues style to new fans.<br /><br />Ain't Messin Around will probably get radio play. What I've loved about the original EP and Gary's live performances are his amazing guitar playing and clean mixes. Ain't Messin Around is heavily produced with many backing tracks and just too much of everything compared to his other songs. This is just one of those almost pop songs that I hope he makes a pile of money with. There are a lot of reasons to compare Gary to The Black Keys - they are both first and foremost blues bands (yes I know, Dan and Patrick don't want to be called a blues band, because nobody buys blues records). This song does essentially the same thing The Black Keys did with Brothers, they moved to a more accessible style of music. Gary went the 80's funk route with less rock and roll edge on this song.<br /><br />When My Train Pulls In - This is the Gary Clark Jr. I love. Exactly in the same tone as Bright Lights, he reminds me that he is an amazing guitar player. This is the reason I love this guy. Studio version of what was an excellent live track on The Bright Lights EP.<br /><br />Blak and Blu - Written by Gary Clark Jr., Gil Scott-Heron, Brian Jackson, and Don Robey. This sounds a bit like John Legend, oh how did Gary let his voice move toward that smooth funk, way over produced style of music?<br /><br />Bright Lights is the final release of the song Gary has been playing for well over a year. It is the big song from his EP.<br /><br />Travis County - Johnny B. Goode, channeling. I'm sure he had fun making this song. My tastes don't run toward the Rock Around The Clock rock and roll. Gary almost makes this a good song, for me it falls a bit short. I hate to admit it but I picture Fonzie jumping over the shark with this song.<br /><br />The Life. Oh no, autotune, Gary no no no you can't do this. Where in the world did this come from? Eric Clapton hates you for this song. This is one of those cute pop songs about getting high. Foster The People would be very proud of this song - hide something in a catchy silly pop hook.  And it is even worse; the engineer added fake record LP snaps a pops to the intro and close of the song.<br /><br />Glitter Ain't Gold - Another good follow up to Bright Lights. Doyle Bramhall II collaborated on writing this song with Gary. I would have liked less backing vocals that cover up the music and Gary's voice. Another song where his guitar playing is front and center.<br /><br />Numb - Yes, finally a real blues song. Hard driving, and painful about his woman doing him wrong. Guitar, drums, and bass - exactly the instruments that make Gary sound the best. Finally, Eric Clapton, and Buddy Guy would be proud of Gary.<br /><br />Please Come Home - oh please, 50's Frankie Valley crooning. Oh no, this is just plain painful. Fully loaded with the trumpets, violins, and silly background music. And then Gary does a great guitar solo in the middle with all the doo whop music playing at the same time. If I wanted 50's music, I'd buy a greatest hits album.<br /><br />Things Are Changin' - studio version of the excellent live track from Bright Lights EP. I do kind of like this even though it still has John Legend floating in it. The difference with the other songs, there is a harder edge to his voice, the rhythm is infectious, and works with his voice. I do prefer the live version.<br /><br />Third Stone From The Sun / If You Love Me Like You Say - Jimi Hendrix song. Gary slowed this song down from the way Hendrix originally performed the song. Where Hendrix cuts words off for emphasis, Gary runs them out a bit longer. They threw in a little organ and scratching for good measure. Gary isn't quite Hendrix on the guitar, but man he is ever so close. This is not a great version of the song, but I still like it.<br /><br />You Saved Me - nasty gritty fuzzed guitar opens this song. But then his voice comes in a little too perfect, a little too smooth. But the contrast is good in this case. I'm not a huge fan of the rhythm guitar hook, a little too simple compared to the gritty lead guitar. Overall, this one pulls those differences off.<br /><br />Next Door Neighbor Blues - Delta Blues!!! Gary on the slide guitar and a ratty old blues microphone, life is fabulous. Hubert Sumlin, and Honeboy Edwards would be proud of this song. I have no idea how anybody could possibly put this song and the opening track the same album. They are just so different and appeal to such a different audience.<br /><br />One big omission from the EP - You Don't Owe Me A Thang is not on this album. I love that song. He could have easily gotten rid of one of those over produced pop pieces of trash and published this song.<br /><br />In the end, download this album, pick and choose tracks carefully. Gary Clark Jr. is an amazing singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He works darn hard and deserves a huge paycheck. I hope he was paid very well for this album. I also hope that his next album goes to what he knows how to do so well, write great music, play an incredibly guitar, and sing his heart out. Leave the engineers and corporate marketing people out of the music.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005G26NJE The Bright Lights EP]]nstruments that make Gary sound the best.

B00821PCJS|3.0|While the story line and opportunities for character development are there, sometimes the poor acting or writing overshadow the more positive aspects of the show.
B008NABUU8|3.0|its an okay game. its interesting. and it has good graphics. but it is way to slow. and needs more examples. and has bad controls.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|A joyous read! An interlocked magically-humanistic tale of love, adventure and the search for our own existence...Nothing compares to this novel - C. David Murphy, author of 'A Diary's House' [[ASIN:B008RANIUE A Diary's House: Where True Love Endures]]
B0091574VI|5.0|Lovely movie for the family!<br />The kids (7,9 and 14) and the adults get engaged.<br />The photography is marvelous.<br />I highly recommended it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game. Its fun for every age. I really love the fact that you can have your own backgrounds and have different backgrounds on the card backs too. Overall Fun Good game.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|yes, this one is fun until you have to wait or stop playing for a looong while to get just enough coins regenerated for you to continue playing. then as you're starting to enjoy doing what you're supposed to do, your coins go bye-bye again, and again, the cycle starts.  bottom line, the coins are a bit tooooooo slooooow to regenerate! :((( unless, of course, you buy some. :((((<br /><br />i enjoy the game, but can't shake off the feeling of being 'ripped off' (i feel like a loser slot-machine addict in a casino) everytime i play :(.  haven't uninstalled it...yet
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I enjoyed the heck out of this movie - I actually watched it twice during my rental period to catch some things I may have missed.  The action sequences were fun and exciting, with the CGI being very well done.  The only thing I that was missing was information on the Black Widow and the Hawk...you know that they are assasins, but not much else.  Since Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America and Thor all had their own movies, you had their backstory so you understood exactly what each of these characters brought to the group dynamic.  Otherwise, I liked the story and how it looped in stories from previous movies, even how they established the team was cool.  Now I'm pretty sure there is going to be a part II just based on how it ended in the credits, but I truly enjoyed this movie and think this is a great rental.  Now I'm going to have to buy the blu-ray disc so I can enjoy it whenever I want.
B008FQBGPE|1.0|This book in my opinion has not weathered well its very dated.Its not like I remembered it when I first read it in the 1960's.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I love HO games and this one was pretty good. easy enough to complete but still challenging.<br />the hint button helped with the direction to go.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Let me start by giving a little bit of background--I'm a huge fan of Taylor's, but I'm also not afraid to give my true perception of something if it's not perfect. Just so you know what I was thinking when I wrote this, my favorite kind of songs are usually slower ballads with deep lyrics. I'm not too picky about genre.<br /><br />Now I'm going to give a brief description of the songs (as I perceive them) and then a couple thoughts. I'll rate each song out of 10, and the ratings are relative to other songs on the album. And I'm reviewing the deluxe edition, so there's six more songs.<br /><br />1. State of Grace: Epic album opener. Rock-oriented. Reminds me of OneRepublic. Lyrics quite strong. 8/10<br />2. Red: Mix of country-rock and pop-rock. Banjos feature, but so does auto-tune. Lyrics strong, but slightly awkward. 6/10<br />3. Treacherous: Not really sure of the genre, but it's a superb track. Possibly country-folk-pop. Very strong lyrics. Best melody: \\"Two headlights shine...\\" 9/10<br />4. I Knew You Were Trouble.: Pop/dubstep. Fantastically catchy chorus. Vocals slightly strained on verses. Pretty strong lyrics, certainly best of Max Martin collabs. 6/10<br />5. All Too Well: A strong country-folk ballad. A lyrical masterpiece. Quite possibly the lyrical highlight of her career so far. Certainly one of the strongest songs on the album, both melodically and lyrically. 10/10<br />6. 22: Avril Levigne meets Kesha meets... Taylor? It's fun and catchy but her voice sounds awful and it just doesn't fit well. Honestly I would rather have seen Girl At Home take its place. 3/10<br />7. I Almost Do: Definitely a throwback to her first album. It has a very country feel, but for some reason it just doesn't stand out. It's not bad though. 6/10<br />8. We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together: Terrible. Sorry. Pop crap. This song could've been replaced a thousand times over with The Moment I Knew. 2/10<br />9. Stay Stay Stay: It's cheesy and silly, but there's a joy in Taylor's voice that's just infectious. Ukulele is the main instrument. Reminds me of Ours, but slightly less lyrically prolific. It makes for a mood lifter in an album of quite depressing songs. 6/10<br />10. The Last Time: Piano and strings are the main instruments. Gary Lightbody's voice and Taylor's blend beautifully in this sweeping ballad. 9/10<br />11. Holy Ground: I really hoped this song would be Irish-influenced. Instead it's an upbeat, dance-y drum driven pop track. I neither like nor dislike it. 5/10<br />12. Sad Beautiful Tragic: This song rips out your heart, leaves it bleeding, tries to sow it back together and then repeats the entire process. Her vocals are certainly the best they have ever been. Lyrics are heart wrenching. My favorite song. Kind of Last Kiss + Safe & Sound. 10/10<br />13. The Lucky One: Absolutely fascinating subject. I heard someone describe the genre as alternative folk, and I think that works. It has a very minor tone. Some of her most introspective lyrics ever. Parts of it remind me of Untouchable, and \\"She Will Be Loved\\" by Maroon 5 (just the feel). 10/10<br />14. Everything Has Changed: Very, very organic folksy feel. The production is sparse and it almost sounds like a live recording. I think it gets better as it progresses. While Ed and Taylor's voices don't quite blend as well as Gary and Taylor's, it's still quite nice. 7/10<br />15. Starlight: This is definitely a magical song. The tinkling piano feels like sprinkled fairy dust. The chorus melody reminds me too much of \\"Don't Trust Me\\" by 3OH3! 6/10<br />16. Begin Again: Fantastic melody, lyrics, production. Very vulnerable and emotional vocal performance. 9/10<br /><br />Bonus Tracks<br />17. The Moment I Knew: Depressing. Feels country but strong poppy drums. Very relatable, nice imagery. 8/10<br />18. Come Back...Be Here: Feels country pop. Could probably easily be a Speak Now track. Nothing particularly unique or standout here, I get why it's bonus. 5/10<br />19. Girl At Home: Quite pop. Interesting subject... it's funny, because she's doing exactly what she told the guy in Should've Said No to do... not cheat under pressure! 7/10<br />20. Treacherous (demo): I don't understand, it sounds exactly the same to me... maybe just slightly less production on vocals? Like that softening effect in my favorite part. But... just why? 7/10<br />21. Red (demo): Once again... not sure what's that difference. Slightly different production, but really... there's still the RE-EH-EH-EDs I hate so much. 5/10<br />22. State of Grace (acoustic): Oh. My. God. As much as I love the original, this is what an acoustic song should sound like. Perfection. Vocals, atmosphere = oooh. 9/10
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It's extremely well written and a great follow up to Bared to You. I can't wait to read the next installment of Gideon, Eva, Cary and all the rest!
B007SGM084|5.0|All I heard was bad things about these books, they are AMAZING!!!!! Even of you've heard what these books are about, read them .for yourself and get to know Ana and Christian!!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Super fun and addicting game. Wish it was available on iOS since I don't have my Kindle anymore. If you like puzzle games this is a good one. The levels start out pretty easy, then some get pretty tricky.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is the same that i am used to, i have to find out how to change the back of the cards.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Absolutely love it!! It arrived in a timely manner. I spent the weekend watching all the episodes that I missed in Season 7. Its so gripping once I start watching it is so hard for me to stop. I love the actors its such an amazing show. I love the profiling and I love the bond between each of the characters.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|I don't know how else to put this other than this album is simply amazing! There are no songs on this album that I don't like, which is rare for me. I'm also not that big on pop, but a lot of these songs are very soulful; with Bridgit's very seductive and strong singing voice, it's not difficult for me to give this a album a full 5 star rating.<br /><br />If you're debating on whether or not to buy the Deluxe version over the standard album. I would definitely recommend spending the extra 50 cents for the deluxe. The three extra songs are definitely worth it!
0525952926|5.0|Excellent book as always for Follett. Book<br />begins in Berlin in 1939 and will keep you engrossed throughout.<br />I heartily recommend.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Being able to monitor my battery is invaluable; I would highly reccomend this app for everyone and best of all it is free! Thanks Amazon!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Not what i expected.  hard to follow at first with all the characters.     better once the story gets going forward
B007THA4FI|1.0|Tedious diatribe promoting class warfare.  She should stick to fantasy. This is not up to her usual standards.  Hope she will learn from this and do what she does best.take us into another magical world.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|if you're tired of boring solitaire card games on your mobile device, you'll definitely want to try mahjong tile game.  it will test your visual recognition skills.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good book much different than what I normally read. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reality TV.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Enjoyed the game. However, i never did figure out what one of the power ups was good for, but i managed without it. Game is difficult enough so it is satisfying to win without being too discouraging. I recommend it for teen and up.
1577314808|5.0|This book is eye opening. Read it with an open mind and open heart. It will change your life forever.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I think this book is helpful. but i think it should have a way for us to type in the word we are looking for and it takes us to that word. right now we have to scroll and scroll and scroll just to find the word. other than that, it's quite helpful. :)
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched The Pacific first.  Thought it was great, so I went back and watched Band of Brothers.  Very informative; gives you an idea of what WWII was like; you'll learn some history and also be entertained at the same time.  Also the special features are really good as you'll meet the real life people the characters are based off of.  Our WWII veterans are getting up there in age so it's important to have a product like this to help preserve their story and legacy.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Me and my husband love this show. We started watching on Net Flix but they stopped on Season 3. I couldnt find Season  any where then went to your website and bought it. Now we have been buying episodes from season 5.Cant wait to watch another one.
0452289963|5.0|Excellent book. I recommend reading \\"The power of Now\\" and \\"Stillness Speaks\\" by Eckahrt Tolle as well. If you are ready, these books will change your perspective on life forever.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|First book was so much like Fifty that it was a little disappointing.  Especially the ending.  It's just ends.  \\"Reflected in You\\" was different.  Story changed and it was very captivating.  Ended better but still cannot wait to see what happens in book three.  Good and quick read!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is not a real LifeProof Case!  I had an issue with how it fit, called LifeProof Customer Service and they asked for the serial number.  There are no serial numbers on this case...it is a fake case!
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Loved the book. Loved it! But I was so sad that the video and audio content didn't work on my kindle, or on Kindle for PC. I wondered what the point was of including it, without a warning that it wouldn't be viewable on all devices?
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I thought this was a pretty interesting book with a very engaging, captivating story. The author did a great job introducing this world in a seamless yet functional way, providing information within the story without making it feel like an encyclopedia entry. I did expect each of the 5 \\"books\\" to be full length, but the first couple were pretty short; overall though they made a full story that still left me wanting more. I'm interested to see what happens next in this series.
B009UQC7NS|3.0|It seems like all of the Walking Dead episodes go like this one: Action at first, useless dialog in between, and really good shocker action at the end. This episode is no different and marks the point where Rick really starts to become the bad guy. Yes there are better episodes, but this is worth the money for sure!
B0063IH60K|4.0|great easy normal solitare. great quick tap moves and quick finish options. choose your own backgrounds cards and more. love it!
B00913P6G0|5.0|Good Kid m.A.A.d City is one of the best hip hop albums i have ever heard from start to finish it<br />just vibes excellently. my favourite track on the album would be sing about me im dying of thirst<br />although the whole album is outstanding!!! GKMC HiiiPoWeR
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album is so awesome. Been a Mumford fan since the beginning and I love that the style of the music and tone hasn't changed. They have carried over the same style from album to album. Also, beautiful typography on the cover again.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Perfection on every level: writing, performance, directing, cinematography.  I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again.  The first time was in a theatre, so each additional private viewing brings that experience back again.  Then I can savor it.  You'll forget it's a movie and simply think you're secretly eavesdropping on other people's lives.  Well worth the money and the time.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great read, for more than just the fact that he is an American hero. Also showing is triumph over adversity, and his achievement of dreams. Great story, a must read!
0765326353|5.0|It really is a fantastic book. I haven't been able to put it down since I first started reading it. It's set in a very interesting world, has great characters that all have interesting backgrounds, it also has great illustrations that only add to the lore. Not since The Game of Thrones have I enjoyed a book so much. I can't wait until Fall of 2013 to read the next one. If you haven't picked this up, you definitely should.
0439023521|5.0|What a fantastic book! Teens who missed Lord of the Flies and other similar stories will love this. 1984, Logans Run, Brazil, there's always a future horror story society out there to rebel against, but where this excels is that the government are so far removed there seems no way to beat them (almost like Cameron/Clegg lol). Just read the first in the tilogy but will def. read the others. Great characters and great story, loved it.

B008NABUU8|3.0|Load times are in the 4 second range on Evo Lte.  Fine by me.  Considering how bridge pieces snap into pre defined grid slots,  controls are adequate,  but not genre defining.  Eager to see what improvements the Dev can incorporate.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I have to admit I didn't think I would enjoy this book, but I think that all the characters main and side were extremely well developed.<br /><br />I also thought the dialogue was great and the way it was presented was a extremely readible
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Being a guy, I thought I'd read this to provide a different perspective, but with over 10,000 reviews, this will probably get lost amongst the others.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty straight forward : young naive american virgin (who happens to be gorgeous) but very self-conscious. She thinks her best friend is everything she wants to be confident and even more beautiful than she is.<br /><br />Then enters Mr Grey the messed-up, hot billionaire. It's not about the money, but it is, because without it he wouldn't have been as spontaneous and romantic. If I owned a helicopter and flew my wife around town, I'm sure I'd get lucky, especially if the night lights of seattle stirred some romantic feeling between us.<br /><br />It's lucky she is good looking too because that is where the desire comes from. Without desire, there is no hanky panky ! :-)<br /><br />Then begins the rollercoaster of emotions. She is new to love and sex, so she is a virgin in both counts.<br /><br />The two previous men in her life Jose and the son of the owner of the hardware shop are considered friends. That's a shame because both seemed like good guys, but alas young women tend to compartmentise their men as friends and those as soemthing more. I feel sorry for both the other guys, but then the story would have no flavour - so that's where my pity ends.<br /><br />Like the book men are from venus and women are from mars, women spend the majority of the relationship trying to understand the guy and perhaps change him and the guy wants to be unchanged and is stubborn to it. The change Anastasia wants out of Mr Grey is romance and love and well Mr Grey wants to be unchanged from the position of Dominator (her as his submissive).<br /><br />Really women in his mind are a chattle, he could have any women he wanted and he has the resources to sweep the majority off their feet. This is tough for Ana, as she knows this and this makes he insecure even though countless times throughout the story, she is told, reminded and advised that Mr Grey loves her.<br /><br />The types of sex they have is insightful. And enlightening, being a \\"vanilla\\" man myself. But this book has moved many a relationship to a more passionate level because of this book. It makes women feel desired and it is a heady feeling that all couples should embrace to make their partnerships and marriages work !<br /><br />He is controlling and there is the contract and Ana tries to come to grips with that. She does hound him a lot [about his past and other women] where a bit of discretion and timing may have been helpful. I felt sorry for Mr Grey as he is the way he is and Ana wants an instant change which is unrealistic. This rings true to reallife drama. All couples in the early stages of courtship go through this to-ing and fro-ing as the skeletons in your cloest continually are revealed. This difference here is that Ana is an angel - she has done no wrong. So the baggage is all one way and it is hard for Ana to understand.<br /><br />The ending is a bit expected and I imagine in the sequel it [ the relationship] will move into a deeper place [which the title indicates].<br /><br />It is not a classic and because it is written in the first person / present tense is reads a bit amateurish. and she does jump between tenses in places which can be annoying and she says things like I frown, but without an adjective to give the frown context.<br /><br />I read Moby Dick [apt title] and Persuasion before this, so to compare this to that...is to compare a burmese cat to a tom-cat. But the plus is that it was easy to read and entertaining.<br /><br />There are some very funny bits and I laughed out loud on the train as I read them. Ana and christian stir each other with playful barbs and I enjoyed watching them use wit against each other. I also enjoyed the emailing - new idea, but it actually broke up the book  because often we talk via email now, so why not include it in the book.e is told, reminded and advised that Mr Grey loves her.<br /><br />The types of sex they have is insightful.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I purchased this book and read it cover to cover within one day.  The information in this book has been life changing and should be considered the new \\"bible of heath\\" for ALL doctors, nurse practioners, nutrionists and homeopathic health care professionals.  Dr. Davis did the research and does this himself, which shows his level of commitment.  I cannot tell you how much this lifestyle has improved my hearing, my sinuses, my constant pain from fibromyalgia, not to mention the weight loss.  At first, I gave up the pasta and the bread and started eating vegetables.  That was great and then I reduced the sugars.  I am currently working on reducing my rice and corn consumption.  I was doing everything wrong and yet was told by all the healthcare professionals, that I was doing everything right. But....I had no weight loss, I still had horrible  pain and was pretty much miserable.  I feel like Dr. Davis' book was a Godsend to me and I won't shut up about it to my friends.  I liken it to someone who is addiction free and seeing clearly for the first time.  I wish everyone would read and re-read this book and try Dr. Davis' way for two weeks...There would be no turning back for most.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was great, I literally couldn't put it down. Honestly I wish the book was longer because I didn't want to stop reading.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|While I can understand that a young audience might not have an appreciation for this movie, I loved it! So refreshing to see a film where older persons are shown to be full of life and romance and passion for life.  So many movies tend to make a joke of the elderly--sadly--so it was high time for this story!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|got this app hoping to get something that could wake me up without using up the battery over night. it does that and so much more. you get unlimited alarms and has some great features like using your own music, doing math to snooze or dismiss and you can adjust the volume of the alarm. no need to pay, this alarm clock is perfect.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|My 12 yr old son could not put the book down.  In an unlikely move, he snuck away after supper to continue to read.
0316228532|3.0|I read mixed reviews but approached reading the book with an open mind.<br />Since Rowling was writing in a new genre I tried hard to banish all thoughts about HP.<br />At first I found the premise promising.....a vacancy on a local council and the shenanigans involved in the election.<br />However very soon it became apparent that the characters were all roughly drawn caricatures with no real depth. Rowling has obviously set up a group of cardboard cut-outs and had tremendous fun moving them around the chessboard with all the depth and feeling of a Desperate Housewives episode,<br />There are some events which should be deeply moving but are not simply because Rowling lacks the ability to make readers actually care about what is happening,<br />In other places, although I am no prude, I was put off by the unecessarily grubby and disgusting details lovingly dwelled upon by Rowling.  Almost as if she set out to shock her fans.<br />I have just finished reading it and ultimately I found it an unsatisfying read.<br />I really hope that none of her younger fans have tried to read it.  Parents beware! This is not a book for the under 16s.
030758836X|1.0|I read the first four chapters and did not like any of the characters. Life is too short to be wasted on a book where you can't make a connection with a character or the story. I skipped to the end and was glad that I didn't waste my time on the middle.<br /><br />The characters were unbelievable as real people and the ending was weak. Both main characters came across as self-absorbed from the beginning.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like that the game never ends. I also love that it has quests and that it's a picture search puzzle.
B005LAII12|5.0|Ted is a Boston based, sometimes sophmoric humorous movie with real laugh-out-loud-belly laughs.  So much so that it's a must see second (or third) time around because the viewer is laughing so hard that many other comedic lines are lost while laughing at the previous lines.<br /><br />If you have a sense of humor, you need to see this movie!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is completely addicting.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has even one desirous bone in their body.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|King's ability to recapture the feel of life in the 1950s and '60s puts him in a class of his own.  Many overlook his insight of the human condition to focus on his horror themes. However, in essence this is a wonderful love story that explores the highs and lows love brings.

B0015RFCZ0|5.0|A great movie for you if you like music. I didn't like Robin williams character so much, but the kid was great. He played the part well looking like he was really hearing the music. His mom was gorgeous of course too, and talented.
B0070NSPCU|3.0|I had a hard time rating this book. I liked it at the beginning, but got sufficiently bored with it at 3/4's the way through and just gave up. Seemed way too long with too little happening.<br /><br />I came to dislike the main character. He seemed to be way overrated ability-wise by the other characters without having done much of anything out of band with his \\"brothers\\". As an example, he and his friends get into a minor brawl with a bunch of soldiers and as an outcome everyone in the city knows him as an undefeatable warrior. Give me a break!<br /><br />Shortly before I gave up, the king made him the leader of a regiment of soldiers. I never saw anywhere that this guy was qualified to lead anything bigger than a squad. He had no training whatsoever. Undoubtedly after I quit, he proved his prowess.

B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Overall the book was decent.  The author did a good job of incorporating many of the greek legends that had previously been unseen.  I was disappointed in the characters interaction with each other.  The ending built to a very high mark and then kind of fell flat.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I didn't know what to expect initially, but I loved it!! It was a pleasant to change to the original Snow White story albeit darker. Charlize Theron did an excellent job!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was looking forward to reading the book after all the hype.  However, I found it to be disappointing, especially the sex scene (can't call it a love scene).  The action of  the man I found to be disturbing and violent against women.  I'm not excited to keep on reading it.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that nearly as many people gave it 1 star.  That was my initial response, too.  I think that the author could have written erotica in a way that would have been titillating instead of off-putting. I enjoy the cheap romance novels and find those quite thrilling.  However, E.L. James, taking a woman's virginity in a violent way is not appealing to most women.
030758836X|3.0|I recommended this book to a friend after reading reviews and synopsis in People magazine. She bought it and told me I should read it, after getting through about half the book. I did. I regret it. This book took you up down and all around, emotionally......then it just DROPS you. I loved the book, up until the last 50 pages. In my opinion, the author had something great, but didn't know what to do with it. What a waste.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Characters are ridiculous and completely inconsistent. The girl is annoying, petulant and spoiled. the story is pathetic. The sex is boring. I could have written a book in better English, and I am Italian. A bestseller? Seriously, what's wrong with people.

B008J344BQ|4.0|Took a little while to get into some of the songs but it is a great CD!  I purchased the clean version since I listen to it with my 10 yr old.  Still some of the songs are a little explicit for young listeners.

Smooth and worked great most of the time, every so often when starting to stream it would load forever and not pull anything up so i would have to go back to the menu screen and try it again.  May of had something to do with internet connection though.
B00932A6G4|1.0|When ordered, this movie was not listed as animated.  Very poor CGI.  Odd, only the bugs looked real.  The 15 minutes spent watching before I turned it off was wasted time.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|This movie is indeed a bloated and long clunker. The script and the story (is there even a story here?) don't make any sense. It's one of those movies that 30 minutes after watching it, you don't even remember what it was about. If one wants to say something good about the movie, at least one can point out that for a while it's fun watching a number of good actors (Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, etc) playing it for laughs. On the other hand, it is hard not end up annoyed by watching so many good actors wasting their talents with a very mediocre script.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|great game. very enjoyable to play. you will become hooked as soon as you start to play. so buy this game
B00542UMIY|3.0|Rented thd movie after adopting a Chihuahua from pound. Better than expected. Some funny scenes. It was worth the price of a rental.  May even rent the next 2.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|There is not much to really say about this movie other then it's great. If you some how managed to never see this movie, spend the couple bucks to watch. You should not be disappointed.
B0090O07RS|5.0|Now THIS is the way to release a classic concert....<br />1) you retrieve all the existing elements and songs<br />2) you get a modern crew to edit the footage and clean up the sound<br />3) you present it in brilliant widescreen!<br /><br />AND... in the value for money department<br />bonus feature \\"Echoes Of the Bowl\\" on the history of the Hollywood Bowl and the Doors talking about playing there<br />bonus feature about the event itself from the participants not only the Doors but the Chambers Brothers who opened<br />another bonus feature \\"Reworking the Doors\\" talking about the technical achievement in fixing the old sound and video etc..<br />and BONUS performances from TV shows as well as a music video....<br /><br />This is just a brilliant way to bring a treasure from the glorious 60's Rock Icons back to life in all the best ways... heck just the concert redone would have been enough but all the bonus features are something we used to only get for something like Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz....I'm very happy to have this, and it is easily one of my more cherished concert videos. I will revisit this over and over again... If you are a fan of The Doors this should be a NO Brainer!!
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|One of the great strengths of prize-winning novelist, Richard Ford's, new  novel CANADA is that we are immediately drawn  into the story because we want to know what happens to a young boy-- the narrator, Dell, when he  sees his middle class  parents being hauled off to jail for robbing a bank. The writing is excellent and the story is suspenseful and engaging.  I think Richard Ford is surely one of America's great novelists!
B001N09BDS|3.0|Usually Leo has some good movies and this was assigned for a class (abnormal psychology). Not knowing the storyline at all before watching this film, I was actually excited. However, that quickly turned into the most boring 3 hours of my life. I fought through and watched every minute, but I would not recommend this movie unless you are into movies that aim at recreating someone's life.

1439152802|5.0|There ought to be a name for this genre, which is a mix of family saga, mystery, gothic and historical. Kate Morton is a contemporary master of this postmodern mash of genres and The Secret Keeper is her most twisty and convoluted page turner yet.<br /><br />Laurel is sixteen years old, dreaming in a treehouse, awaiting the hour when she will sneak off to meet her first boyfriend and desultorily watching the family birthday party in progress. A man approaches along the quiet country lane and speaks to Laurel's mother, Dorothy, who reacts with horror to the intruder. Laurel witnesses the entire encounter and things aren't ever quite the same.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper veers between two periods, WWII London during the Blitz and contemporary rural England, where Laurel's mother is dying without ever revealing the truth of the shocking events of that summer day in the early sixties or of her life before marrying Laurel's father and becoming the perfect mother.<br /><br />In WWII London, Dorothy is an ambitious and dreamy young woman who yearns to marry her handsome photographer boyfriend Jimmy and cement her wartime friendship with the compelling, mysterious and upper class Vivien. The three of them meet and interact in ways that will affect people for generations to come.<br /><br />The twists in this book are astounding. I have read a lot of these historical family sagas with a family secret as the plot engine and I love them, but I can often figure out at least part of the secret. Not so here. And the reader is given the further challenge that the youthful Dorothy is not nearly as likable as the Dorothy of the early sixties and the Dorothy of the twenty-first century is mostly a sick non-entity, with Laurel taking the lead in narration. Just what happened in the London of the Blitz? Was Jimmy Dorothy's lover? Vivien's? Did Dorothy leave Jimmy in the lurch, an act she has always regretted? What about the mysterious Vivien, dead in a bombing on the very day Dorothy left London, turning her back decisively on her own life? These questions turn and twist in the reader's mind and are never fully answered until the last pages. The Secret Keeper is a wonderful read and Morton has surpassed even her own mighty previous efforts. Highly recommended.left London, turning her back decisively on her own life?

B00887490Y|4.0|This movie turned out to be the weirdest that I have seen in a while. However, the originality of the unpredictable plot twist was a pleasurable relief from the common mediocre blueprint that many movies seem to be following these days. The Tall Man addresses issues of child rearing by unappreciative or at least incapable parents and the effect it ultimately has on society as a whole. This was a strange one indeed, but I liked it.

B0000009TT|5.0|Product was new, and in excellent condition, as advertised.  Wonderful price, good communication, and it shipped my way very quickly.  This box set is, in my opinion, the definitive Frank Zappa compilation.  An amazing songlist, fantastic sound, right at my favorite juncture of Zappa's long and amazing career.  So many Zappa fans, new and old, often ask--which disc should I buy next?  Well, \\"Lather\\" is a must for a novice listener, along with a seasoned fan.  I came here, to Amazon, for wonderful selection and a great used price.  This disc is somewhat rare and retails for nearly $75 when it is rarely seen in a store.  I paid nearly half that amount, and now I have the rest of my life to listen and enjoy this amazing musical accomplishment, by my salient musical idol.
0060853972|5.0|Before I read this book, I was only familiar with Neil Gaiman via the Sandman comic and I hadn't read anything by Terry Pratchett so I didn't know what to expect. That was years ago. Going back, I can now see which parts were most influenced by whom. The book is a nice blending of Gaiman's mythological world-building with Pratchett's cleverness and dry wit. To really appreciagte it requires a working knowledge of Christianity and an extremely dry sense of humor. Not for everyone but I really enjoyed it.
0553386794|5.0|My 30 year old son lent me Season 1 of the HBO series of this name.  It was so great that I had to go back and read this book (and the rest of the series).  I purchased this for my mother for Christmas as I feel she will love the action, the intrigue, and the characters.  Not many series appeal to three generations but this one definitely does.  It is fantasy that doesn't seem like fantasy because the issues span every age.  There is violence and sex without being prurient or a turn off.  I highly recommend this series to all.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I already knew I would enjoy Season 7 and I was right.  I haven't finished it yet but so far so good.  The DVDs were shipped in a timely manner and the box was in excellent shape.  Altogether I am very pleased with my purchase.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|Quentin Taratinos Death Proof was a different kind of horror film.  It reminded me of Pulp Fiction with Psycho elements addes.  Kurt Russell is fantastic as he usually is.  He plays a demented psychotic who enjoys killing people with his cars.  What is interesting is that we also see that he is a coward, which adds a more interesting side to his brutal character.  There is also the element of his being someone who wants to be a killer, rather than someone who IS a killer by nature.  I took off a star because this goes on a bit too long during wordy dialog scenes.  I am not terribly into most car chases in films but this has a spectacular one at the end.  It is not a must see movie, but it was mostly entertaining, with some unique parts.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was amazing . Much better than the first book and I also enjoyed it more than 50 shades.. can't wait for book 3 , sucks having to wait till Dec 31 :-(.. but I will ring in the new year right by starting the 3rd book.

B007X4N0DU|4.0|A lot has been made of P.O.D.s decision to include a word that is considered profanity in the song \\"I Am\\". Which is sad because this is a really great record. They have some of the aggression back in their music that they displayed in their early days. I have been a fan of P.O.D from the beginning and in my opinion this record does not disappoint. All of their CDs are good,some are just better than others. But what band doesn't have records that are better than others ? The only two songs that i don't particularly care for are \\"Bad Boy\\" and \\"West Coast Rock Steady\\". They just don't have the punch that the rest of the record has. All in all this record is worth your money and it ill not disappoint. Finally a word about the profanity. I agree that including the F word was not the wisest choice. But to be honest I find the fact that it is censored to be more annoying than the word itself. The blurring of it takes away from the song. I think it would have been better to have not put it in their than to censor it. Like i said, putting it in was probably not the wisest choice but I think the furor over it is mostly overreaction. Especially since the rest of the lyrics on the album honor Jesus. In my mind their are things that people say each day that are far worse and more destructive than that one word. Many people wouldn't dare say that word but have no problem with gossiping,insulting people, telling people that they are ugly, stupid, worthless etc. Our speech should please God and it should build people up instead of tearing them down. Cruel words spoken to someone are far more harmful than a single \\"cuss\\" word. Colossians 4:6 says \\"let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt\\". Our world deems that word profanity, and that is what makes it bad. It is the way that people view that word. Hateful speech is worse than a four letter word. Don't allow a single word to keep you from getting this CD. It is a great record.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy this game... but hate how much energy that it takes and how long it take to get more.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|The Google Play Store got v2.3 back on 10/9. Why is it taking so long for Amazon to get the same update?! Very frustrating.

B009GEBBNQ|2.0|Impressive effects, but the storyline was predictable. Not one to put in the awesome category. I wouldn't watch it again.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|This is probably my least favorite Jane Austen novel.  It's a bit difficult to read but can still bring you into another time and place , like all her other books, if you give yourself the luxury of a few quiet moments to emerse  yourself in it.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking Bad, Season 4 was everything that was advertised and more.  Great story line and acting from Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston.  Can definitely see why Aaron Paul won an Emmy this year.

B009GEEMLY|5.0|Overall a good movie, and well worth the rental.  I'd see it again.  The characters were good, a little simplistic in its overall mission but a good quick watch.  I do think it needed more hulk though.
B005SAV9SO|1.0|This movie is a disgrace. Highly offensive to the educational system (and teachers) and just painful to watch.  Apparently, in the education world, being a cheat does get your ahead!?  I think not.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I pre-ordered this item and it was delivered to me within 2 days of the release date. If you like action, super heroes, and special effects, this is the movie to get. Highly Recommend!
B008NABUU8|3.0|The game concept is interesting, but a better bridge building basics or examples would make the game less frustrating. Seeing trucks fall into the ocean can be amusing for only so long.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have to say up front I wouldn't recommend this book to people who hadn't read the predecessors-you just won't get enough out of it.<br /><br />There is a lot of stuff going on inside John Corey's head, and not a lot of action for a good portion of the book.  But, as I think about it, DeMille didn't have a lot of options.  The situation in Yemen is so completely and totally screwed up I don't know that I would have understood or appreciated a lot of the nuance without John's snarky running commentary.  So, while 75% of the book is not terribly action-oriented, what it provides make the rest of the book very, very good.<br /><br />I thought that perhaps the Panther was not a truly worthy adversary--more of a guy who got really lucky one time--but he represents something that needs illumination.  While he is no Lion (the best bad guy ever!) the Panther is actually a little more frightening because his blundering posturing and idiocy are a little too real.  I think he is representative of the guys we really are facing in this region right now. . . and that is terrifying.<br /><br />Sad Kate didn't have a bigger role, but circumstances prevented it.  LOVED seeing Paul Brenner again.  This was a good thriller, and DeMille is a terrific author.  If you're a John Corey fan, you absolutely must read this book.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I need to write at least 20 words about this... Yeah, they are wonderful. Great sound, great materials, great software.<br /><br />I already had<br /><br />Speakers Logitech Z-10<br />Keyboard Logitech G510<br />Mouse Logitech G700<br /><br />I just love Logitech...
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone seeking purpose in life.  His experiences validate his years of research and it is a psychology little mentioned in today's world.  This book is gripping, but you must engage with yourself and apply the lessons to your own search to make it impact your life.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I have been listening to this album non stop since it came out. Lover of the Light is one of my favorites so far. I know other people say that it sounds just like their 1st album but who cares. Get the deluxe edition just for The Boxer. Great cover. Highly recommend this album.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Very well written, with many plot twists and turns. The Cassie carachter (Clare Danes) is too overaught and hysterical to be believed as a member of the CIA. Many Patinkin is excellent as is Winters. All in all quite taught and well paced.
0425263908|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. If you're a 50 lovers. You'll think this is so much better! The apparent connection that the two share is very electrical.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry Birds Space is a nice addition to the Angry Bird family.  Having to deal with different worlds and gravity issues makes it a lot different than the previous games.  I like that you can go in different directions around the atmosphere.  Pretty cool!
B005LAII0I|4.0|I liked this movie better than snow white and the huntsman...at least this one had a sense of humor about itself and the prince was HOT! Mirror,Mirror Snow White is much prettier in this movie than the Huntsman SnowWhite.
B00065JTBA|5.0|This is a must have, tons of great songs that could have been hits if on the main albums. \\"We Rule The Night\\" is fantastic.<br /><br />I have one question though for the other Bon Jovi fans.....where is \\"Love is War\\"? This is a great song that I though for sure would be on this, but it's not. After doing some research, I heard it might be on the \\"Japan\\" release of this but I can't find that either. Does anyone know how I can get that song also?
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Love this.<br />4 Blu-Ray discs of TWD Second Season, lots of Extras, included the Webisodes.<br />And the Head it´s BLOW.<br />PERFECT.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very disappointed!  I knew it was supposed to be somewhat \\"dark\\", but  it  is totally depressing.  I guess I really liked her writing style in her original series and this is so different and not anything I would recommend to people in my reading circle.  Sorry Ms. Rowling.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|First I got the free version.  I liked it so much that the next morning I bought the upgraded version.  It is very relaxing with so many sounds and combinations to create.  You can even create a favorite and save it for next time.
B005QUQP76|4.0|This is an amazing mouse, I moved from my NAOS 5000, which was a great mouse, but this works better for FPS, where as I would recommend that mouse for people looking for comfort and for casual play.<br />First off, the most recognizable thing when using the mouse is the sensor, it works AMAZING, it is one of the best mouse sensors I have yet to come across.<br />me personally, I had to get used to the ergonomics of the mouse after using such a comfort mouse, and it is small, but I have rather large hands, so I works well, just have to adjust.<br />the slippy feet are also great, because I use a terrible mousepad, and it works perfectly fine, with a nice glide, can't say how long it'll last though.<br />the mouse wheel is also nice being tactile. (not as tactile as a want it to be)<br />and the weight system is genius because you can place weights directly where you want them to go, for front of back heavy.<br />there are three problems though<br />sniper button is rather useless, just marketing hype, get's in the way and you can't reprogram it<br />the two buttons above the sniper button are very small, and it's rather annoying<br />and the side have a weird grainy feel to it, unlike the other rubberized areas, you can scratch it off like I have, so minor gripe<br /><br />overall, being a real FPS gamer, I would give this a 4.5/5<br />not perfect, but extremely good especially for being only $50
B005HEKJMI|5.0|She has nice boobs and a nice ass also. I kind of regret that we have resorted to that. I am a scifi fan, and I think we have left the mark. boobs and ass back to basic insticnct
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Along with Wired for Innovation, this book by Brynjolfsson and McAfee clearly works out the consequences of the efficiencies that IT has brought to the commercial sector by pointing to both the impacts of IT on company productivity and organizational structure and the societal consequences of these transformations.  Among other things, the clockspeed drive of IT is outrunning the `skills absorption' capacity of major segments of the workforce, leading to disruptions in employment.  This is a thought-provoking and important book.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book! Amazingly developed and beautifully flawed characters. Hot scences but a better story line. If this is your genre, it is a definite must read!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Enjoy the challenge of this game.  Since I spend a good bit of time in waiting rooms it is a great time filler.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|I have to say I struggled through this one a bit although it improved in the last third.  I continued to read it mostly because I spent twice what I would normally spend on a kindle book and wanted my moneys worth!  For me the characters began to grate a bit.  The constant running away from every problem that occurs in the first half of the book started to wear thin and you wanted the pair of them to grow a backbone.  The author did manage to keep the characters interesting and memorable - even though I've read a good six or seven books since this I still remember all the character names and storyline which isn't always the case for me.  I will probably buy the third instalment when it comes out as it was written well enough to make me want to know how the story ends.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I had been waiting for Season 7 of Supernatural to come out for months, and let me just say it was well worth the wait! The 'boys' are just awesome this season. No spoilers promise but you get to see less-crazy Sam (which is always nice) and the boys are fighting a new evil called the Leviathans (an ancient race that seems unkillable). Definitely a great buy!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Slammed is one of the most emotional books I've read this year. I cried more than I did when I was reading Pushing The Limits by Katie McGarry and believe me that was alot. And no, Slammed wasn't all sad and dark, there were moments when I would go all 'aww' and moments when I laughed hard at something a character did or said.<br /><br />Even though the fact that Lake and Will pretty much fell in love with each other after their first date, three days after they first met which I think is too soon to have such intense feelings about each other, I still loved Slammed. It was hard not to, really. Colleen Hoover has a way with words -and slams- that just sucks you into the story, never letting you go until there is nothing left to read.<br /><br />I found it very hard not to relate to Lake and bound with her as a character. The problems and heartbreak she went through were very hard and threatend to break her, but Lake won in the end and got her Prince Charming. Because Will really is Prince Charming. Totally swoon-worthy, hot and sweet. Oh and he slams! What's not to love about that?<br /><br />Slammed is heartbreakingly beautiful and a page-turner with a forbidden-love that makes you hold your breath 'till the last second. My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a novel interpretation of the Fairy Tale - not as dark as the original Grimm, but certainly not the sweet interpretation of Disney.  It was fun to watch, particularly to see how they wove in the traditional story elements we all expect to see in a Snow White story.  A fun evening.
0743201140|1.0|I bought this book new from Amazon but the access code for the StrengthsFinder survey was missing - no envelope or anything, like there's supposed to be. So, I returned it. Then I saw that there are a lot of reviews here from buyers whose book came with the access code but it was invalid, so I will go buy this in a local bookstore rather than risk it here.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|I had the time and figured it couldn't be as bad as everyone said. I was wrong. Dark Shadowns could have been a comedy if it had been funny, I'm not sure what they were aiming for but they missed the mark.<br /><br />We all know Johnny Depp loves his make up but this was so over the top, the only thing it had in common with the TV version of Dark Shadows was the name of the caracters. Very disappointing.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Thought this would be an enjoyable game and it was for like the first 15 minutes. Really nice graphics, ran nice and smooth on my Kindle Fire. Then low and behold the &quot;free&quot; game is no longer free&hellip; it prompts you to pay for the full version if you want to get past the very beginning. Utterly ridiculous. It should be titled as &quot;demo&quot; since that's what it really is. Almost 300 Mb of space for an unplayable game? Save your time and memory, give this one a pass. Wish I had.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|with the entire Ring Cycle available for viewing anytime, along with the companion Documentary film, this collection gives Wagner lovers a new production to view, and argue about...some have not given it a good review, due to Lepage's machine, but I thought the staging was different, yet held to some of the composer's staging desires.<br />At least the Met didn't stage it as some post-modernist mess or some metaphorical monster, as other Opera Houses have done.<br />I loved it, and I've watched it over and over.<br />the casting was great, especially good were Voigt, Owens, Blythe, and Erdmann.  I loved the digital Forest Bird, too!!!!<br />Bringing the Ring into the digital age, while honoring what the composer would have desired, the Met does it great!!!
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games: Book Review<br />By: Morgan Rawle<br /><br />I read the magnificent book The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. This book is written in first person point of view. Also, if you are in the mood for a young adult, science fiction adventure novel, this book is perfect for you! The Hunger Games makes me feel smitten by the excitement and suspense. Know that when you read this book, it will make you want to sit down, read, and keep reading until you've finished. Suzanne Collins is so descriptive and detailed when she talks about the setting. The narrator of this book is Katniss, the main character. Her perspective is more tense and protective than a normal writer's. I adore how her writing varies in styles. For example, when Katniss talks about her younger sister, she speaks very protectively. Whereas when Katniss speaks to Gale, she is laid back and relaxed. You never know what Katniss is going to do next!<br /> The setting adds so much effect to the story.  The fact that it is set in the future makes it so much more exciting.  It takes place after a world war that destroys everything.  A new world civilization is created where the country is divided depending upon its resources.  These are called districts.  There are twelve districts. Some are based on farming and agriculture while others are based on mining and electricity.  In fact, one important part of the setting is the arena.  This is the place where most of the action happens.  The tributes are sent there to fight to the death.  The arena is interesting because the climate and the environment are controlled by the game makers.  It changes and makes the actual games more difficult for the tributes.  The setting creates a spectacular image in your mind that takes you into the world of the Hunger Games.<br /> The characters in The Hunger Games are spot on.  For example, Katniss, the girl who would abandon her own life to save her little sister, Prim, is relentless.  She is very resourceful and a great role-model for young women.  Some of Katniss's intelligent skills are that she is amazing at archery; she is also very wise when it comes to which plants are safe to eat.  Peeta, on the other hand, is so gentle and kind-natured any girl would be lucky to have him for a husband.  Peeta has so many skills, including baking, designing cookies, camouflaging, and so many other things.  I for one am utterly in love with Peeta Mellarck.  Both Katniss and Peeta are from District 12.  All of those people work in the mines or go to school.  Also, Rue is one of my all-time favorite characters.  She is so sweet hearted and down to earth.  If I could be anyone in this book it would be her.  The characters in this book are indisputably magnificent.<br /> This book contains action, love affairs, and suspense. This book leaves you gripping the edges of the book wanting to find out what happens next. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Has there ever been a movie made with such beautiful men? Yes thats superficial but as my 7 year old granddaughter said \\"seeing Thor was worth the price of the ticket.\\" I've seen it three times, twice in the movies and once One Demand, I guess I could be called a \\"fantard\\" which is funny since I'm not into comic book characters but the movie was not only well casted it had a good story line and great special effects.<br /><br />I had to give a side bar to the Hulk, this is the first time I thought the actor did a believable job and the CGI didn't look like someone got crazy with a green crayon. I gave it 5 stars because I can't think of one thing I would do different.<br /><br /> I will say I saw the guy who plays Captain America in a interview and in the real world he's a jerk with a huge ego.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|This is a excellent book, i have read about 10 years ago and today is a pleasure has in my kindle.

I lost data on my SD card, and went to reinstall it, and now it is suddenly not compatible? Please fix the compatibility list, I'm in the middle of games! I'll give it five stars when it is fixed.<br />This is a great game, if I could continue my games!<br />Thank you for your time.
B009P13RQY|5.0|Since I've discovered the Sword in 2008, few new bands have impressed me more. Most rock/metal coming out today lack the guitar virtuosos we became accustomed to in Thrash metal and it's progenitors. It lacks original lyrics, original riffs, and is seriously lacking in real guitar solos that aren't a simple trip up and down the scales. The Sword is one of the rare exceptions to the rule that makes me really love metal again. So many segments and songs sound decidedly retro, a throwback to the 70's, while they constantly scream through with modern takes on old themes and styles.<br /><br />This album is infectious. It seeps into your bones, creeps into your brain, shakes you thoroughly and just takes you to a separate world of their making. The Sword has continued to plod forward through their sludgy riffs, screaming solos, and haunting vocals. Uplifting bridges and somber moments (Like in \\"Hidden Masters\\", as with \\"To Take the Black\\") throughout lift you up, take you down, and leave you unprepared for the unrelenting assault on your eardrums that follows. Apocryphon marks the 4th album where they've done something incredible, failing to hit the point most bands do when they give up/\\"sell out\\" up and make something mainstream. They're committed to their music and keeping it their own, and it really shows. It's rare for a band to get a fan like myself disillusioned with old favorites like Metallica and Offspring and change my outlook on what bands can really be with a work ethic like these guys have.<br /><br />Their many influences shine through here, the vocals are eerily like Ozzy, many trudging riffs take you back to old Sabbath, ZZ Top (with a cover included it's no wonder), and even some old prog rock standards like Rush. But they keep the music distinctly their own (I cannot emphasize this enough, I know it can be annoying to be compared to the work of others, but they have really carved out their own cave in the cavern). Sticking to concept albums seems to really just take this band out of this world and set your mind far outside of the monotony of the day.<br /><br />I had the immense pleasure of meeting most of the band outside Neumo's in Seattle last year. They are down to Earth and humble, in stark contrast to what you see on stage. I went from getting a recommendation on a place to get tacos from Bryan Richie to having Shutt's solos shredded right in front of my face with a prefectly laid setlist. If you haven't had a chance to see them live, do so. They simply give it their all on stage as much as they do on Apocryphon.<br /><br />I've listened to it twice already, and can't wait to get home and play it on my home system. The bonus live tracks are a really awesome extra, something that often sounds poor and under-produced on other bands' albums, but not on this one.lly just take this band out of this world and set your mind far outside of the monotony of the day.<br /><br />I had the immense pleasure of meeting most of the band outside Neumo's in Seattle last year.

B0098VXBIA|3.0|If you are trying to get pregnant or have ever lost a pregnancy this is not the movie for you. While the movie pokes fun at pregnancy anyone who knows anything about Elizabeth Banks knows the heartbreak she experienced in her very real life while trying to conceive a child, so it was sort of bitter sweet for me to see her in this role even though she did a good job.<br /><br />The movie was funny, well acted and pretty much dead on but again it's not for everyone.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Blending fantasy and a western has been done before, but with Joe Abercrombie's talented approach, this is a triumph.<br /><br />Returning home to her farm Shy and Lamb, her friendly and cowardly giant of a labourer, find it has been attacked and her small brother and sister taken.  She and Lamb head off after the attackers, but what can a determined girl and a docile giant do?  Well both of them have a past that might help....<br /><br />So the pair of them track the attackers, joining an expedition out to the far West (where gold has been discovered), where duplicitous companions and native attacks stand in their way before they arrive at \\"Crease\\"  (think Deadwood from the TV series), a town at war with itself, before a final confrontation in the mountains with those who have the children.  And everything you expect, doesn't happen.<br /><br />I am trying to avoid spoilers, but this is Abercrombie at his very best, clever and witty dialogue, brilliant plotting and complex and evolving characters occupying a world of dark violence.  There is an element of potential redemption in this one, the authors characters are usually different shades of grey, with dark and violent pasts but one or two here try hard to change and a cornerstone of the plot is whether they will or not.  And more than a few faces from previous books appear, but you don't need to have read the previous works (although you will have missed out big time if you haven't)<br /><br />This is the sixth book from the author and he has hit new heights.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />(Review from UK hardback)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has kept my attention. I just didn‘t want to put it down. Can‘t   wait to read the next book. I would recommend this book to any one.  Love it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I've been a Stephen King fan for as long as I can remember and I've always enjoyed his work but with that being said the only way Mile 81 would have redeemed itself is if it was part of a short story collection. Then one of the other stories in the group would have filled that void this short left the reader with.  The story had great potential to build into something gripping but it just ended.  The book needed at least 10k more words to fill it out then it would have been another Stephen King great.
B009NBSLIU|3.0|I think 2 dollars to watch one episode is to much but I paid it since our DVR didn't record Resurrection. It's sad when you get caught up in a series you know isn't all that good but you want to know what you missed just in case the show gets better.<br /><br />Revenge is like watching any of the afternoon soaps, just one of the few that doesn't have anything to do with vampires. The acting is good/o.k. but the plot is wishy washy trying to find twists and turns to keep peoples interests.<br /><br />The best part is no commercials!! It's almost worth the two bucks not to have to watch the plethora of commercials !
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am still struggling through Casual Vacancy and am about 40% finish. I hate to say it because I really enjoyed Rowlings other work, but this book just seems to spin and go no where. I keep expecting it to have more of a plot, but so far, it is very 1 dimensional. That is so strange considering the mass of imagination shown in Harry Potter. Its like someone else wrote this book.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a very informative book but it does leave you with some unanswered questions but the author is quite up front about that shortcoming.  There definitely is a need for further testing of how modern day wheat effects the body.<br />I wish the author had expounded on the carbohydrate requirements of athletes but the book is directed at people with medical issues and too much visceral fat.  Very good book.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I must say that this book was not only detailed it was heartwrenching and very sad.  I applaud Jaycee Dugard for her bravery at such a young age.  It was very sad to know that she had through go through such torment.  thank God that she was finally rescued and is not safe to live her life as she wishes and to be there for her children.<br /><br />I dont want to say that this book was awesome because the actual story is heartbreaking but the moral of the story, a little girl who survived this horrific ordeal is an awesome story in itself.<br /><br />To jaycee, you are brave, and may GOD bless you from this day forward and nothing will erase the past, but you can make your future as you wish.  GOD BLESS YOU and your FAMILY.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Interesting, involved story line that keeps you guessing and on your toes.  The cast is excellent, and it was actually sad to watch the last episode, knowing we now have to wait for Season 2 to finish and get released!
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|The light works as advertised but there are some things that can be improved.  Detection range is limited - it doesn't seem to detect motion very well below the sensor, so as a light mounted on a high wall it doesn't work well.  Despite 8 LED's the light could be brighter.  The good part is that it's durable.  I used the velcro to stick it to the wall, and the sticky fell off and the light came crashing down onto a ceramic tile floor.  No damage and it worked just fine afterwards!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Really enjoyed this book - well developed storyline which tells the British, German, Russian and U.S. perspective through interesting characters. Highly readable and loaded with interesting facts about this era's habits, etiquette, events and evolving political views. Hard to put this book down, I'm looking forward to part two in this trilogy.
B008NABUU8|1.0|Game pros:<br /><br />Easy to construct bridges;<br />Different construction materials;<br />Good progression from very easy to harder.<br /><br />Game cons:<br /><br />Slow to load;<br />Causes Kindle Fire to repeatedly hang, causing need to restart device.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the game cons, especially having to constantly reboot, far outweigh the game pros. I didn't get off the first island so can't evaluate the whole game. After four forced restarts, deleted game from my Kindle Fire.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but it just wasn't very good.  It was slow from the start, never really reaching any kind of pace that was interesting.  There were a few good moments, but nothing close to being something I could recommend to people.  All in all, I would say it was just dull and boring.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|The big name actors all are superb, and render the film very disturbing. It could be Securities, Life Insurance, or a number of other tough ways to make a living. It is \\"Willie Lomax\\" in the Real Estate Vacation Property Sales Office. Jack Lemon plays a very tragic \\"down om his luck\\" salesman who steals a lead and makes the big sale. In the end, he is led away by the Police! Why? Buy this reasonably priced movie to find out!
B00171EO0I|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies - cannot go wrong with this one.  Of course there are sad parts, however, the majority of the movie was laugh-out-loud funny!
B008AWBQGW|5.0|This CD is very good and its definitely a good buy because it is what you would expect from Lynyrd Skynyrd. The music is right for what is going on in the world and on the right track because it comes from a southern rock band that's been around for a long time.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Like most who read and were absorbed in the Harry Potter series, I had high hopes for Rowling's first \\"adult\\" novel. Unfortunately, she did not deliver.  I found \\"Casual Vacancy\\" very slow going, the character relationships muddled, the plot mind-numbingly heavy and slow, the language often offensive, and overall, the tone of the book was just plain depressing.  Not recommended.  Wish I had my money back.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Although I own and have read the actual book a few times; I was very happy to get it on my Kindle and at such a great price. I was hesitant to read this book at first, but after my daughter assured me that it was my taste I thought I would give it a try. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked and couldn't put it down. Neil Gaiman weaves a tale that hints at being more without giving away too much before it is time. I will tell you that it does all comes together near the end with a head slap for not catching the meaning of the hints earlier. I found this book to be a masterpiece and one of my favorites. It brings together so many beliefs (some ancient, some more current) and adds in the twist of an unlikely Hero that feels lost in everything that is happening. It is hard to write a review on this book and not give away parts of it. So, before I make the mistake of giving away something, I will end this review.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|I decided to go ahead and get the electronic version since both of my boys LOVE this book.  No more ripped pages for us, and we have it with us everywhere we go!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|As a long time Reacher fan this book was disappointing. Not among his best. I feel funny answering an email to rate a book as I am just a reader not a critic. People who love Reacher will buy this book anyway and if a person is not a fan - there are way better books in this series. The authors use of painstakingly examining Reacher's critical thinking skills are getting too detailed. We could have 5 pages on why Reacher chose eggs for breakfast. I am sure the next book will be better.
B002APU580|5.0|I felt like I lived back in the era of Jane Austen.  The movie touched me in such a way that I did not want to leave it.  I will watch Pride and Prejudice over and over again for many years. I just adored it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|title and rating says it all.  its a great game just it restarts on me every once in a while
B007THA4FI|4.0|J.K. Rowling's The Casual Vacancy to me was about everyday life and what humans go through.  It was very well written and I totally bought into the town and the characters.  There was no fantasy in this book.  You could go into almost any town in the world and come away with these raw human emotions.  I liked how she reminded all of us that people are not always what them seem.  People turn out the way they are due to their youth circumstances and whether or not they are surrounded by loved ones or people who really care what happens to them in this world. It's also about how small minded people can be when their egos get in the way. I definitely suggest reading this novel.  I think that we all were \\"curious\\" of what Ms. Rowling would come up with after the huge success of Harry Porter, but I find it absolutely ridiculous that this book and the HP series be compared.  That would be like comparing apples and oranges.  Looking forward to her next book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I actually went back and retread the first  book so I would remember all the details.  I really loved Reflected in You and I can't wait to read the next one.
B008I2OAEE|4.0|When The Gathering's signature vocalist Anneke von Giersbergen left the band in 2007, it seemed like it would have been nearly impossible to find a singer who could fill those very big shoes. But they did in Silje Wergeland, and 2010's \\"The West Pole\\" was the result of their labors. A pretty solid effort, though not up to the standards they set with records like \\"How to measure a planet\\". This time though, Silje has settled quite nicely into the band, and in many ways, has offered an improvement on the \\"gothic trip jam\\" sound that has been their signature for nearly twenty years. In fact, Silje, unlike her predecessor, has a nice ability to transform her vocal style to fit the different moods and patterns found on this album. I swear, she sounds like three different singers on this one album, and on occasion, reminds me quite nicely of Anneke herself. Musically, the band has returned to their more experimental style, so if you're looking for \\"Mandylion Part 2\\", you won't find it here. If, however, you like the languid, hypnotic style of albums like \\"How to measure\\" and \\"Souvenirs\\", you'll want to check this one out.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My 5 year old loves the Angry Birds games.  His favorite is Space.  This keeps him entertained for as long as I will let him play it.<br /><br />For adults, it is amusing for awhile.  Certainly worth $0.99.
B00835A8SS|5.0|This is a great episode of a great show!  If you have not seen the other episodes you will probably be lost and not know what is going on. I would recommend this action packed show to anyone who loves drama, mystery, love or suspense. In order to fully enjoy this episode you need to have watched all those that come before.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i luv this app becase it  is really loud and i luv the rooster alarm noise that one is so annoying that you have to get up and turn it off i tried slepping thru it but it wont work it alwas wakes me up
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|Wow, how many years has it been since an \\"album\\" of this magnitude come from such an icon. The songs are wonderful. The title song about the sinking of Titanic is clearly phenomenal.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I'm not really sure how to review a browser.  I'm not a power user who dissects every feature.  I installed Dolphin and I use it.  It is fast enough on my underpowered device, has multiple tabs, and doesn't crash.  After installing Dolphin, I haven't felt the need to try another browser.
B00913P6G0|4.0|Believe me when I tell you i'm a fan but the reception and critical praise this album is getting is laughable. They have the nerve to put it in the same sentence as illmatic which was perfect for it's time but short with no flaws, now the lyrics are there, even though i can do without the alien voices kendrick displays throughout, production also isn't anything to brag about either, I mean come on your signed to Dr. Dre's label (Aftermath) and you have not one beat on here???? I feel cheated and I'd say section 80 is more classic then GKMC at least it flowed like an album as a whole.If he would have added the bonus tracks to the regular album maybe I would hop on the bandwagon like everybody else. 7.5/10 at best only because I know he can do better.
B001NYTUXU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I watched it several years ago. I had always thought the music in the film was powerful. I bought the soundtrack to relive the experience while doing homework. I am not disappointed and if you like Hans Zimmer, you cannot go wrong here!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read the first story and loved it now I'm blazing through the pages of the sequel.  This series is the best, muy caliente...nice story line that keeps you interested :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This first book in the trilgy was EXCELLENT!  I absolutely could not put it down, very well written.  Hated for it to end, but couldn't wait to get started on the 2nd book Winter of the World to follow not only the original characters but also their families in the 2nd booki.  Lover it !!!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I was shocked at how terrible this movie was. It started out good and quickly fell off the cliff. I will say there was some promise there, and it was ruined. I love movies and sci-fi stuff but did not enjoy Promethedud. It ruined the entire Alien and Predator series and timelines. BLAH!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's GREAT. Saw a friend playing and decided to check it out. It's adicting and really chalagening great to pass the time.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Criminal Minds: The Seventh Season is an outstanding season for the show.  This year, the show ended up a edge of<br />your seat episode with a wonderfully, emotional ending with JJ getting married to Will.  However, Pagett is leaving<br />the show.  (How sad!)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I truly do love this book and the movie. I can relate to this. I would call my self a Wallflower too :) So amazing and inspiring and also kind of funny in a way, but I will say that its a Must See Movie 100%
B0006HBZXS|4.0|I love the movie even though it is an older movie.I wish it would have been available in full screen,I hate the black strips across the top and bottom of the TV screen.
B004AM5QT4|4.0|I like Ken Follett‘s books in general, so twins and genetics only made the choice easier. And, yes the book delivered nicely. Mr. Follett‘s writing is always riveting and sure to leave one with a few more kernels of interesting education.
0345803485|1.0|I had to read 50 Shades because it had gardnered so much attention.  What was the big deal?  Now that I have read it, all I can say is ...Well, I'm at a loss for words.<br /><br />I kept reading hoping that there would be some unexpected development, like a plot or storyline that would be even remotely believeable. From concept to execution this book on a scale of one to ten rates a zero.<br /><br />This has got to be, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the most poorly written novel I have ever read.  What is so upsetting is that it could be so popular.  I am not a big fan of erotica to begin with and if I never read another book like 50 Grays it will be too soon.<br /><br />What an ennormous waste of time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is awesome , the book was way better then originally thought and now can't wait for the next book to come out
B008673ZAQ|5.0|very very good ending to the 1st book! I would recamend this book. perfect for those suffering from 50 shades withdroll!

B005LAII12|5.0|I am 39 years old and there isn't too many movies that can really make me laugh. A few laughs here and there but Ted had me in stitches! I did not expect the movie to be this good. I also thought this was a movie for kids (teens). My teenage son and my toddlers along with my husband went. Definitely not for the toddlers.<br />The movie was sold out the first time I went and we saw the later show and the theatre was filled completely.<br /><br />I don't know how some people can say it wasn't funny at all and it sucked. If you are a prude or you have a dry sense of humor you won't like TED. It contains a lot of crude humor and again definitely not for the children. Overall it was a great movie!!!
B008Y67LEK|5.0|This is a lovely book. It's a bit disturbing at some parts, but being a teenage girl, I can relate to some of her thoughts. This is a book that makes you think. I would recommend it to anyone.

0307361012|4.0|Jo Nesbo left me hanging at the end of the previous Harry Hole novel - Phantom. Phantom was the 9th book in this Scandinavian series that features the conflicted and complicated Detective Hole. But the first book - The Bat - that introduces us to Harry is only now newly released in North America. You can bet I jumped at the chance to read it!<br /><br />Harry is sent to Australia to assist with a murder investigation as the victim was a Norwegian national. But the local cops define 'assist' differently.<br /><br />\\"What you're gonna do is watch carefully while we haul the bastard in, tell the Norwegian press along the way what a wonderful job we're doing together - making sure we don't offend anyone at the Norwegian embassy, or relatives, - and otherwise enjoy a break and send a card or two to your dear Chief Constable.\\"<br /><br />Harry is not the focus of the first part of the book. Instead we are introduced to Aussie detective  Andrew, who has a sense of where he wants the investigation to go. Andrew was a strong personality and I felt slightly overwhelmed by this character. Nesbo weaves much Aboriginal history and lore into the narrative, which I found really interesting. It also added much to the plot.<br /><br />Harry and his personality begin to emerge slowly as the book progresses. I was hoping that Nesbo would allow us some insight as to where Harry's tortured psyche springs from and I wasn't disappointed. And, as the case develops, the Harry that I've come to enjoy so much emerges. The character of Harry has been refined and darkened and sharpened over the course of the next eight books, but in The Bat we meet a raw, wounded version of the detective to come. One with \\"a weakness for living.\\"<br /><br />But, what hasn't changed is Nesbo's plotting. The Bat is an excellent detective novel that provided a 'kept me guessing' plot with lots of suspects to choose from. Reading the first in this series just confirmed why I have Jo Nesbo and Harry Hole on my must read list. Nesbo combines fantastic characters, great plotting, lots of action and suspense and yes, social commentary into addictive reads.read list.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This product was hard to find and download because I had downloaded it before and reset my android because the dummies at Acer said this was the only way I could fix a weather report that kept on saying the temp in Tawian.  So I had to reset it twice and it still didn't fix the problem.  Then I went to reload the Kindle app and it said I had already loaded it.  I had to call tech support and she guided me throught the process to get in back on my Acer 100.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|The Crossfire series are intense and riveting. When you think you have the plot figured out, it takes a turn and surprises at times. Can't wait for the next one to come out - too long a wait (May 20013).
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is a fasinating series, the characters very interesting, it has been compelling reguarding the psychology of the whole story.  Can't wait to read the 3rd.  Amazing how one person can totally change anothers outlook on life, as with Anastasia effect on Christian, also the effect of Ellena earlier in his life.
B000J1U0ZK|4.0|Loved this movie! My favorite out of the serious. The only thing that could make this movie better is if it was in HD.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This movie is absolutely outstanding! It has smart jokes and is very clever. This movie is so unique in every way, it's fantastic! I love this movie, the characters are interesting and flawed which does not make this the normal animated movie. It may be fun for children, but I think it's the adults that get a kick out of this one.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|This was a fantastic book and was gripping from the first word until the last. I enjoyed the way it was written which leant itself to being a fairly easy read. Happily recommend this to everyone who is interested in this genre.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Its a great story and a wonderful game. Well worth the $1.99. I wouldn't expect less from the creators of &quot;Mystery Case Files&quot;. I cant wait for more!
B008PZ69T8|4.0|15 Beautiful selections of classical pieces, very relaxing and romantic to listen to. Most of the master composers are represented on this CD.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|It was a fun search game. Update - I went back through the game and had a lot more fun.  I think since this was my first time ever playing this type of game, my expectations were a little off. Perhaps the multi-touch turning could use some work; otherwise, it is one of the best I've tried.
B0091REZMW|3.0|addicting...great details...almost too many sometimes. needs more ways to earn diamonds without having to purchase them...if an app is truely free you should never have to purchase anything.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I'm about two-thirds of the way through this book and after a confusing start -- there are so many characters to keep track off -- I'm having a problem putting it down! I grew up in England and am familiar with many of the very English expressions and words; \\"people carrier\\" for example which, in the US is a minivan. The personalities are very lifelike and help you understand how everyone has a story they keep hidden from everyone else. A good read!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Many of the reviews on here praise this movie for it's visual prowess. Personally I think that is like praising a brain dead super model. Yeah, it looks good and the action sequences are crazy. However, it has NO semblence of a plot. The movie as a whole is incoherent, disjointed, and just generally stupid. Nothing flows, and everything from the acting to the diologue is terrible. I don't know what the director was smoking when he inflicted this peice of shit on the world, but if you have half a brain you will find it as insufferable as I did. Don't waste your time.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed it better than the first book  The relationship between Eva and Gideon was an emotional rollercoaster; makes me appreciate my simple one.  I am really looking forward to the next book, can't imagine what Sylvia Day will dream up.
B007THA4FI|2.0|As a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, I anticipated this novel with great excitement and high hopes.  Regretfully, I have to say that it fell far short of my expectations. Although it's more literate than most soap operas, it's still a \\"potboiler\\" of a novel.  After a very slow, plodding, beginning, it builds into a somewhat engaging story, in which we find out what lies beneath the surface of the lives of the residents of a small English village.  I hope that one day Rowling will give us another novel in the fantasy genre, as I think that is where she truly shines!
111846446X|5.0|The book is well written, contains information on what is and what is needed to install the Raspberry Pi, what other hardware components you can use with it, how to download and install its Debian Linux based operating system in a flash card, and provides the basics of Linux sys admin, an introduction to Python, etc.  It also covers keyboard, video and network configuration, including wireless connection. Finally, discuss its use as an \\"office\\" machine, and a full graphics machine, in addition to discuss other hardware and software possible uses of the Pi.<br /><br />A great book to beginners with the Pi and a good source of documentation for all users of the Pi. A must if you own a Pi.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Maybe I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It is still a typical Hollywood production, but had great imagery, decent acting, and a believable story.  This won't go down in history as the most amazing movie ever, but it was entertaining for a Friday night movie night.

0525953728|5.0|Like he says in the book, if you're looking for classified info, look elsewhere.  Having said that, it's a great perspective on all the prep that goes into such an operation. This guy doesn't toot his horn, like so many politicians do, yet he and his comrades have risked so much more than any of the politicians.<br /><br />Thank God America still has people like these guys...they make us proud!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is a great science fiction young adult novel written by Suzanne Collins. Split into 12 districts, North America (know as Panem) is now controlled by the strict capitol. Every year one boy and girl tribute is selected to represent their district for a fight to the death, this is known as the Hunger Games. The first person structure in this novel makes it very easy for me to follow the writing style. The book has such a creative plot line, and in my eyes has a marvelous futuristic feel to the story.<br />Given the fact that this book is based in North America it makes me compare and contrast many things in North America today and in the Panem future. In the setting of the book it is mostly fabricated in the Capitol and the Hunger Games arena. If Panem did exist it would be Salt Lake City, Utah and living in SLC Utah makes me vision everything ultimately the same of what I see everyday. The arena where the games take place I envisioned a great forest with countless tall pine trees and prominent mountains surrounding the tributes. How Suzanne Collins wrote the book really helped me imagine the great country of Panem and the arena in which the Hunger Games take place.<br />The characters in the book are so alive with the intense details that describe each person. The main characters Katniss and Peeta make the book more likeable with their strong attributes. Katniss is a great hunter and good with a bow, in the book it tells how she would learn the great skill of using a bow from her father. Peeta on the other hand is in a family that owns a bakery, so he is strong from lifting flour bags and he is on the more wealthy side of the people in district 12. When given two tributes that are dissimilar in many ways it is simpler to compare them and get a better understanding on the lifestyle in Panem.<br />Suzanne Collins is a great author and she explains the plot and setting through fascinating characters in a very laid-back manner. I personally enjoyed this bookvery much with an easy to follow story line with remarkable characters to take you along the action packed book. Hunger Games is a great read and once you read the first book you have to read the next two in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was great. Can't wait for the third of the series to come in December! I wish they would put it out early so we could all find out what happens! Loved it so much I've read them both twice now and starting on it again!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|As a person who loves books, technology, and puzzles, I thought this book would intrigue me.  It did just that, but it became a little fanciful in some places.  It moved right along, not a real grabber, but kept me reading.  All in all I enjoyed the book and it gave me some things to think about as we'll.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Walking Dead Season 3 continues to push the limits of cable television. Following two outstanding previous seasons, Season 3 is off to a great start. This show is well written, well filmed and the acting is simply great. The character interaction is special and once hooked, you can't get enough of the Walking Dead. If you're new to the show, the first two seasons are short and I recommend a marathon to catch up.<br /><br />Watch this show!

0312576463|4.0|I just finished \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzen. It is a wide ranging two generation type family history book. Lets just say that if you settle for who you can get rather than who you want sometimes the ramifications can go on for decades, especially if your write a therapeutic autobiography not for publication describing the situation in detail. For goodness sake don't let the person you settled for get the therapeutic autobiography because then all crap breaks loose and even though the person you settled for is now the person you want, they may not want you any more and that is really bad therapy.<br /><br />And the kids, oh yeah the kids. You can really screw the kids up royal especially if they turn out to be as big a jerks as you are.<br /><br />I loved Franzen's The Corrections, and I love this book also. Not very many others did. I got my copy in the remainder bin at Barnes and Noble. Really cheap
B005LAIHYU|3.0|We are now being overfeed with vampire and werevolves movies. Some good...lots bad.<br />But this little movie, which is also about vampires...also brings you a former<br />President...Mr. Abraham Lincoln.  I said it like that cause the actor does a very<br />good job in portraying him...and as a bonus we get to learn about the era of<br />slaves and freedoom and the cost of the battle of Gettysburg in which so many lives<br />were lost....so all of this is portrayed in this film with much more.<br />Its a keeper.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|This CD is played every single day in my car because the songs are so incredible that I can't imagine a day without them.  I would love to say which one of the songs are my favorite, but they all are.  Normally I find one or two songs on a CD that keep my attention if I enjoy the album, with Halestorm, I just love them all.  Familiar Taste of Poison may be one of the most gripping songs I've ever listened to.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Very good fast moving book. I love Ken Follett so there may be some bias, but I do recommend this book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Excellent continuation of the story of the demigods.  The Roman and Greek demigods must work together to save the world.  I enjoyed it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. I read the Bared to You then Reflected to You after I read 50 shades of Grey..I was not disappointed at all. 3rd book coming and cannot wait for it. The end of the book leaves you wanting more. You will not be dissapointed in this series.
B009MO5G90|4.0|RE: RETRIBUTION 3D REVIEW:<br /><br />Resident Evil Retribution 3D Review: Even better 3D than RE: Afterlife<br /><br />This movie plays with your head sort of like Inception did, never letting you really know what's going on till about midway when Alice is finally let in on the reality of the situation. A bit jarring at first, but very unique for a RE Film. That aside, the story is fairly basic, from point A to B with some side stories thrown in for good measure. Finally, this fifth RE movie does a nice job paying tribute to the previous RE films in many ways as you'll see, and hints clearly for a follow up film.<br /><br />If you know the Resident Evil series, you'll know there's usually a heavy emphasis on full on action. Retribution lives up to the term \\"Roller Coaster\\" by providing nearly non-stop action, literally. Just when Alice (Milla Jovovich) finishes on action scene, another enemy shows up and attacks, leaving little room for story development in between. So think of it as a total @ss kicking action movie made for your entertainment along the lines of The Expendables 2 and you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />The action sequences are incredible in terms of martial arts choreography (especially the opening attack on Alice in the white halls = amazing mix of roundhouse kicks, flipping, tossing, locking, cracking heads, chain flicking and shooting).<br />Then there's guns blazing every few seconds, Zombie attacks in the Suburbs, Las Plagas \\"Smart shooting zombies from the RE 4 game\\" confrontations in Moscow, fast speed car chases, stalking Licker monsters, giant butcher Axe Men attacks in the city, and an ending arctic fight scene that goes on for a glorious five minutes at least. All done with explosions, special FX and splattering blood better than before. Incredible action.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich (Aice) and a number of returning members including Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) deliver their lines with a relaxed believability that comes off as genuine. The roles of Ada Wong and Jill Valentine however, are a bit robotic, perhaps intentionally but still mildly distracting, as they were/are under the control of Umbrella. Leon makes an appearance, but again, some of the delivery of his lines could have been more natural. Otherwise, well done.<br /><br />TomandAndy return from Resident Evil Afterlife and compose another great industrial electronic film score that rocks and beats along with the action. Excellent and worth a purchase for the soundtrack again.<br /><br />If you're a Resident Evil Fan of any of the films, this is highly recommended. One of most visceral, guns blazing action movies around, despite the basic plot. Paul WS Anderson keeps getting better at delivering stylized, action packed movies. He can still work on his storytelling however.<br /><br />The 3D in Resident Evil Retribution delivers in spades, being filmed in three dimensions with on the set 3D camera rigs, we get a consistency of powerfully layered visuals, with clear stereo 3D distance between the objects onscreen. There are also plenty of pop outs to flinch away from as bullets and blades fly out of the screen to great effect. This is one of the best 3D movies you can get as Anderson shows he's not only a master of action movies, but stereo 3D scene composition. So if you're looking for another demo worthy 3D disc, look no further than Resident Evil Retribution, boosting the 3D up even more than Resident Evil Afterlife 3D.

1455527475|3.0|If there is a company in the United States needing an infusion of public good will, it's probably Goldman Sachs.  From 2008 to 2010, Goldman got enough bad press to keep an army of PR specialists employed a lifetime. When CEO Lloyd Blankfein claimed \\"Goldman Sachs is doing God's work\\" the public backlash was fast and furious.  Hollywood could make a horror movie segment from Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi's description: \\"the world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.\\"<br /><br />And it's more than invective that has recently shaken the company.  Goldman was fined $10 million by Massachusetts regulators in 2011, and $22 million by Federal regulators this year for not having adequate safeguards in place to keep research tips out of the hands of big clients.  Adding to the acrimony, former Goldman board member Rajat Gupta was convicted on multiple counts of securities fraud and faces a sentencing hearing later this month.  Prosecutors are asking the court for an 8 to 10 year prison sentence.  Into this well stoked cauldron of excuse and abuse, former Goldman Sachs VP Greg Smith now drops his expose of daily life at the company: Why I Left Goldman Sachs.<br /><br />The drama leading up to the book's release was just as sensational as the vitriol surrounding Goldman itself.  Just before release, Bloomberg News aired a segment on a Goldman in-house study claiming to have interviewed dozens of people to determine the source of Greg Smith's grievances against the firm.  The findings? Goldman says Smith left the firm  two weeks after he was denied a raise from $500,000 to $1,000,000 per year.<br /><br />The book opens in a dramatic fashion -  large airy room, hardwood floor, Persian rugs, runny yellow lights streaming from low wattage table lamps, young people dressed in Brooks brothers suits, Armani skirts; a young woman is peppered with questions about Microsoft- questions so intense she bolts from the room in tears.<br /><br />Smith does for students of financial analysis what The Paper Chase did for law students.  Only we are not in a classroom, we are inside the world's best investment bank.  The author displays a deft sense of humor, as when he trades in his Miami Vice style sharkskin attire for a Brooks Brothers suit, and you can feel the moneyball culture taking hold. Then there's the fabulous story of the professor teaching the principle of comparative advantage -why California is so good at wine making- and he teaches the lesson dressed up as a huge grape.  Smith has a novelist's way of making you sympathize with his persona, and this is a point all the financial reviewers have missed.  There is another subtext weaving through the early pages: how the top universities are feeding grounds: incubators of talent for tomorrow's big fish today.  It's never outlined as such but it's part of the general tone of Smith's writing, and it's a convincing conversation he has with the reader, an integral part of what is known today as \\"the hookup culture\\".  The writing reaches a fever pitch as the author describes his first heady days on Wall Street, days when the World Trade Center was still a viable part of the Wall Street landscape and his intern tag was a mandatory part of his trading floor wardrobe, and it's almost breathless knowing that this person is someone who, one day, will almost surely be rich.<br /><br />Inaccuracies begin on Page 47 when Smith writes \\"..in the summer of 2000, the bubble hadn't burst yet.\\"  In point of fact, the tech bubble had burst earlier that Spring.  By April, 2000, as first quarter earnings were announced, it was clear that just having internet \\"eyeballs\\" wasn't enough, as many firms had claimed, and that you needed to find a way to \\"monetize\\" those eyeballs, make them pay off somehow; turn internet viewings into countable cash. When that wasn't happening, Wall Street soured on tech stocks.  On page 48, Smith steals Allan Greenspan's \\"irrationalexuberance\\" phrase  yet somehow, it works and a reader will suspend disbelief, at least for a while.  More sophomoric props and pratfalls follow, including nightclub outings that quickly become tiresome, and readers will begin wondering when the real action of the book begins.<br /><br />Searching for your first brownstone apartment and tensions associated with passing the Series 7 exam will seem like self serving trivialities to many readers, who will begin comparing this book to Jim Cramer's hard hitting Wall Street saga Diary Of A Street Addict.  When Smith says the Series 7 exam \\"was a hard slog\\" some readers will say so what.  As a Harvard undergrad, Jim Cramer was trading stock options to make ends meet, and that kind of danger gives his book an edginess Smith's schoolboy pranks can't match.  And then too, Smith's description of 9/11 is offhanded and completely callous.  There is not a single word of empathy for the victims, not a single word of solace for the hundreds of Cantor Fitzgerald brokers who died in the catastrophe.  Goldman Sachs competitors to be sure, but human beings, and fellow citizens they were, not to mention laborers in the same vineyard, and it is a merciless and robotic person who doesn't acknowledge this.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book sheds useful light on Wall Street's casino culture, the gambling that went on all day, every day on anything and everything including who would make it and who would not, and this is important because this nation began funding the gambling habits not only of individuals but institutions as well.  Of the $750 billion dollars given out to banks in the TARP program, about $450 billion went to cover not bad mortgages, but bad bets by big banks and this is exactly the kind of betting Smith depicts in Why I Left Goldman Sachs.<br /><br /> As a series of individual escapades and pranks, the book is more humorous than serious, but tied to what we know became a national roll of the dice in the housing markets, Smith's book is a useful and fundamentally scary look at how the American financial system is based more on the shifting sands of caprice than long lasting bedrock principlesexuberance\\" phrase  yet somehow, it works and a reader will suspend disbelief, at least for a while.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Downloaded the color crossme when it was the free app....couldnt wait to purchase the original...well worth the money!!!! I think I enjoy the color app more though.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|Disappointing!  With all the hype this movie got, we thought this would be an awesome movie.  It was a dud, just didn't live up to the hype for us.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Sadly the Matrix is one of those series which progressively got worse. It's not as bad a drop off as going from Terminator 2 to Terminator 3, but the 3rd movie in this trilogy is really weak. The first two movies plus the extras and the Animatrix are worth the buy though, all of them are very good in terms of audio/video quality and the extras are always worth a look.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the second movie at all, I would go with these over the single discs. If you can't stand the 2nd or 3rd, just pick up the first one on its own.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Again, I thought that this book surely couldn't be worse thatn the first two, but I was very wrong!  What a sick story!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Very few movie makers can pull off something like this. Something which is not only engaging, but really sweet and touching while still having moments of pure hilarity (another movie which comes to mind is [[ASIN:B001AQO400 Lost in Translation [Blu-ray]] also starring Bill Murray) and Wes Anderson really pulls that off in this movie.<br /><br />Here we have these two kids who just want to be together and yet they're surrounded with dozens of clueless adults and a whole scout troop out to sabotage the young boy. The film is essentially about being with the person you love against all odds. I don't really want to go into the story too much as it's really something worth seeing as this isn't a movie you can describe to people without them going \\"So, like, these kids run away on an island? Why are you telling me to go see this?\\" - trust me, it happens a lot trying to get people to see this.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray quality, it has very good sharpness, good black levels and great colours. The film was shot in 16mm so there's grain throughout the whole film. Let me make this clear: This is intentional on part of the filmmaker to give it a specific look. The Blu-ray looks exactly how it was intended.<br /><br />The audio is mostly spoken mixed with the excellent music selection which usually accompanies Anderson's films and it all sounds perfect. I can't comment on the surround as I'm still on a 2.0 system.<br /><br />You're going to be hard pressed to find a better movie in the last couple years. Stop reading reviews on this and buy it.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Suzanne Collins must be pretty twisted to come up with a storyline that requires parrents to ship their kids off to an arena where the \\"winner\\" has to kill all the others!  I thought the books couldn't get worse than the first, but they did!  Unless you like reading perverse, twisted stories about children killing each other for sport, this trillogy is a very poor read.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|did not fit my Kindle right.. i have the new Kindle fire hd 7inch.  so i gave it to a friend and it fit hers fine.
B008GFI3QE|1.0|\\"Produced by George Martin\\" is false advertising.  It should really be called \\"Giles Martin's Home Movie of George Martin's Career\\".  When I bought this DVD, I thought I was gonna get an insight to producing by George Martin, especially with all the subjects that were part of the DVD like Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr.  I thought it was going to be similar to Geoff Emerick's book on engineering at Abbey Road entitled  [[ASIN:1592402690 Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles]].<br /><br />Instead what I got was a \\"This Is Your Life\\" style home movie that George probably ok'd to give his son a producing credit.<br /><br />It's a shame that such a brilliant man of 85 is not doing more to protect and enhance his legacy.<br /><br />Do NOT buy this DVD.  It's an utter waster of time!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie much more than I enjoyed each of the character's individual movies. I am a bit peeved that they continue to use a different actor for The Hulk. Loki is just about the wimpiest evil bad guy, but that didn't really take away from the movie.
0385523912|4.0|I'm South Korean.  The stories in this book were utterly believable.  Koreans never really had a history of democracy before the peninsula was divided.  We've always had a rigid hierarchy and lived under authoritarian leadership.  So, parts of the story which may seem strange to a westerner are completely believable to me.<br /><br />However, as a Korean person I can tell you that some of the details in this book are wrong.  The Korean word \\"Bap\\" does not mean rice, as the author states.  It's steamed grain.  So, steamed rice is \\"ssal bap\\" and steamed barley is \\"bolee bap\\".  The author also claims that \\"Ahbugee\\" can mean father or God.  That's absolutely incorrect.  The confusion arises because Christians refer to God as \\"Our Father\\".<br /><br />One more thing, the author states that immediately preceding the Chosun dynasty was the Three Kingdom period in Korea.  No. Before Chosun was Koryo, where the word Korea comes from.<br /><br />As an engineer, I know that when I find a few issues there may be many more issues that I did not find.  So, take this book with a grain of salt.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The film was entertaining and worth the rental. The interplay between characters really made the film. Continuing to build on those fragile relationships against any evil doers would be a good sequel.

I love the way Gillian Flynn writes, changing perspective from chapter to chapter so you know what is going on from everybody's point of view, not just one person.  I literally could not put this book down!  I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a good read.

B0034G4ORC|3.0|Battle:Los Angles(released Mar/11)stars Aaron Eckhart as USMC SSgt. Michael Nantz,Michelle Rodriguez as USAF TSgt.Elena Santos,and others as part of a Marine division from Camp Pendleton,who must defend L.A. from an alien invasion:the last bastion of defence on the west coast.While the movie sure is a promising one in idea,in execution it fails to deliver the goods.There are some tense moments,but they're confined to a very specific section of the film,and what one finds is before and after to be a let down.<br />The plot involves Sgt.Nantz who is due to be retiring after 20 years on the job for his country.However,the next day,what appears to be a shower of meteorites into the oceans off of many major coastal cities,turns into our worst nightmare.The press of course are all over it and we see innocent civilians being killed on a beach as an alien attack force comes ashore.A forward base of operations is established at the Santa Monica airport,from which Sgt Nantz is now commanding a small squad of soldiers to rescue anyone still alive at a police station in a hot zone that has been established.In fact it is this hot zone,a section of the city leading to the waters edge,that is slated to be carpet bombed at a predetermined time.Nantz's squad,therefore,is on a strict timetable to get everyone out and back into the safety zone before the bombs drop.<br />Nantz and company's progress through the streets is slow and tedious.They have met no resistance,and they're within a short distance of the police station.Suddenly all heck breaks loose as the company has been led into an ambush,as the aliens have the rooftops to their advantage.It is now a game of survival,along with meeting their objective.They finally reach the police station,hold off the aliens there,then regroup with forces stragglers and civilians,and hop aboard a commandeered bus back to safety.It is not going to be an easy trip,as along with ground alien forces,there are alien airborne hostiles and they are homing in on any radio transmissions that are sent out.<br />The groups bus is stopped just short of their goal,and from here they must battle a serious group of alien forces to get out of the area,with the clock,of course still ticking on the bombing.Their group,now decimate down to a paltry few,finally make it out of the zone and brace themselves at the appointed time for the bombing to start;but nothing happens.When they reach the airport they find out why;it has been strategically taken out by the aliens.Nantz learns of an alternate evac zone and takes his people there.A helicopter arrives and they fly away.However Nantz looks down to see a rather large area of the city blacked out.Nantz believes this is the aliens command post.He orders the chopper pilot to let him repel off the chopper and recon the area.His gung-ho attitude by this time has spread to what is left of his squad and they all repel down with him.It turns out he HAS found the alien terminus and the aliens become aware he has.A huge alien ship slowly rises from the ground and attempts to leave.Nantz and company radio in that that they will laser target the craft for incoming missiles.The alien ship is successfully taken down and all alien activity in the area ceases.Back at base Nantz and his men are told to rest up but Nantz gears up once again for more action,as does his squad.<br />The film is shot in a you-are-there style,with alot of camera movement and fast lens focusing.The film makes the most of it in the section of the film where Nantz and company enter the hot zone,winding their way to the police station.This is when the film finds itself at its best,fighting the aliens up close and personal.But in the lead up to this and the time afterwards,I find the film settles back and coasts along,not generating much excitement.The filmmakers took great pains in acquainting us all with tactics forces personnel would use,and do use,under such circumstances;a little too much.We are with the soldiers themselves for a good part of the movie,and,like them,are never in on the bigger picture of things,until they are.This works against this film and doesn`t generate the sustained excitement it needs throughout the picture.Also the only time we really see an alien up close and personal is with the ``autopsy``scene.Otherwise the aliens pretty much keep their distance and mimic combat tactics the humans are using,of course with a different technology,making the,in the end,far less intimidating.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include four featurettes on the movies making.<br />All in all a lacklustre film from all standpoints.The aliens themselves are interesting but the filmmakers chose to have these things using human like tactics in fighting(which makes them less threatening)and the camera technique of a you-are-there feel only works,in the long run,against the film.Take it or leave it,it`s up to you.mselves for a good part of the movie,and,like them,are

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Only half way thru the entire collection since I started a couple of days ago. But obviuosly the stories continue to pull you into each one as you go. Part mystery, past sci fi, part philosophy, part anti-politic. I had not heard of this series until I bought it on Kindle and I'm glad I did. As a kindle special it is awesome. At regular price it would still be awesome.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|Battleship(released April/12)is another enterprise/film similar to Transformers(their property also)in look and feel.We have the great CGI effects and the grandiose musical score.The movie traveled along pretty well until about the 70 minute mark,then it seemed to lose its steam,failed to capture its initial excitement and coasted the rest of the way out.The film stars Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Alex Hopper,Liam Neeson as Admiral Terrance Shane,among others.<br />The plot involves Kitsch as a smart but out of control 26 years old,with no solid direction in life and who lives with his brother,a commander in the Navy.After getting arrested his brother has had enough of his antics and enlists him in the Navy also.Fast forward and Kitsch is a lieutenant on board a destroyer.The back story to all this is that a group of scientists have found a planet outside our solar system that is much like earth and are sending signals to it via a sophisticated satellite array.<br />Admiral Terrance puts his ship fleet on maneuvers along with several other countries,in the Pacific.While his ships are engaged in this,five alien objects enter earth's atmosphere with most flying into the ocean,while one crashes through the city of Hong Kong,creating much damage.<br />While authorities are examining the wreckage of the Hong Kong crash and determining that it's metal is of unknown origin,things are happening in the waters near the fleet exercises.Kitsch has been put in charge of a destroyer and his crew examine some unusual objects sticking out of the water.While on top of one of the protrusions,Kitsch is zapped by an electrical current and thrown back.Suddenly the piece he was standing on raises out of the water and we see that it was a small part of a larger space craft,and they are not happy campers.<br />Before you can say John Paul Jones the fight is on.The aliens have two very destructive weapons:first are hamburger shaped and wizzing dynamos which when they land destroy anything inanimate,and the second thing are smaller projectiles which impact a ships surface and almost immediately explode with usually fatal and horrific results(similar in shape to the pegs in the game Battleship).Both of these weapons are used to great success throughout the film,but at this point they almost completely disable and/or sink the fleet of ships in the area.They also throw up a round and enveloping bubble of energy,that is virtually impenetrable.This energy field essentially isolates a few of the fleet's ships while excluding the rest.It is a good way of protecting the alien's main contingent while also testing their battle skills against Earth's.<br />Back in Hawaii where the space arrays were set up to contact the alien world,the aliens themselves have come to roost there.They need the array itself to send a message back to their home world,as it is believed the one that crashed into Hong Kong was its main communication device.Kitsch's girlfriend manages to contact Kitsch and tell him that the satellite that the dishes line up with,will be in sync in a short time and that he must destroy the arrays before they do.Out in the Pacific,what is left of the fleet is just one ship.Through the use of Tsunami buoys in the ocean(the idea of a Japanese commander),they calculate the positions of the alien ships.They eventually manage to destroy all three of the alien battle space ships but their last remaining battleship is destroyed;and they need to destroy the mother ship creating the large force field.<br />They return to Pearl Harbour where Kitsch gets an idea to take out the old USS Missouri battleship,decommissioned since /92 and now a floating museum,and the only vessel within the energy bubble.With the help of some old vets,Kitsch gets his wish.They re-enter the fight and take down the remaining alien ship and the force field.Before the USS Missouri can be taken out by the aliens the fleet,previously on the outside looking in,now enters the fray and destroys thefinal ship along with the arrays.<br />The film ends as everyone who survived is being awarded medals.<br />The film is good until about the 70 minute mark.We had been intro'd to the main plot(attack of aliens and our reaction),and the side plot of the transmitting arrays;even the sub plot involving Kitsch and the admirals daughter.Up until that mark the film does a good job at integrating all plots and keeping the pace up.The film's pace slows considerably after the main battle is through and the filmmakers seem to want to concentrate too much on Kitschs's girlfriend and her involvement with the arrays,an amputee serviceman and one of the array techies.Of course it is germane to the story but after the wild battle ride we had just experienced,the rather slow pace and less exciting events on the ground seem a world away from what is happening out in the water;where the action really is.The film tries to get the dynamic up again,as events in the water start to build inexorably,but they never do reach the intensity of what had come initially.And besides this,whatever events do happen on the ground,they all originate from the battle out at sea.<br />As an aside,I was wondering what Hasbro is doing these days with their properties,such as Transformers and this one,besides trying to make more money from them? Those games and toys were first discovered by kids way back when,and it is kids generally who still play with them.But these movies are not geared for kids,as they're way too intense.More like they're geared for the kids that have grown up and first discovered them when they first came out.Although I can see parents these days either still getting their kids into seeing these films and/or letting them watch the movie either when they rent or buy it on DVD;NOT recommended by me at any time.<br />Finally this film is a tribute to armed forces veterans everywhere.They are present(real vets)in both official ceremonies in the beginning and at the end of the film.Also appearing is Gregory D. Gadson as Lieutenant Colonel Mick Canales.He is seen here as the double amputee and the man Kitsch's girlfriend is assigned to.Gadson is a well known and decorated war hero in real life and it was a really nice touch adding such a person to the acting roster.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include three featurettes.<br />All in all a movie with a good potential,which they fulfill until about the 70 minute mark,then it all starts to unravel.This is an effects driven picture,in sound and look and should have been better than it was.Hasbro's Transformers got it the first time and fizzled out the second time.Maybe since they fizzled out the first time here,they will get it the second time around.3 1/2 stars.final ship along with the arrays.<br />The film ends as everyone who survived is being awarded medals.<br />The film is good until about the 70 minute mark.We had been intro'd to the main plot(attack of aliens and our reaction),and the side plot of the transmitting arrays;even the sub plot involving Kitsch and the admirals daughter.Up until that mark the film does a good job at integrating all plots and keeping the pace up.The film's pace slows considerably after the main battle is through and the filmmakers seem to want to concentrate too much on Kitschs's girlfriend and her involvement with the arrays,an amputee serviceman and one of the array techies.Of course it is germane to the story but after the wild battle ride we had just experienced,the rather slow pace and less exciting events on the ground seem a world away from what is happening out in the water;where the action really is.The film tries to get the dynamic up again,as events in the water start to build inexorably,but they never do reach the intensity of what had come initially.And besides this,whatever events do happen on the ground,they all originate from the battle out at sea.<br />As an aside,I was wondering what Hasbro is doing these days with their properties,such as Transformers and this one,besides trying to make more money from them?

B007THA4FI|3.0|J.K. Rowlings is a good writer and this first try at an adult novel is entertaining, but not great literature.  It was difficult to follow all the characters and I had to keep paging back to remember who was who.  That said, it's a decent read and worth the time it takes to complete it.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|this movie had me very nervious as a kid.. i never had the desire to go to the circus after watching the movie. Greatest scary clown movie of all times
B008XG1X18|5.0|My FAVORITE app by far!! Totally hooked! Enjoy all the great perks of Pinterest with a single click! Easy to use and pin all your things.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I don't agree with 'Mark Owen' writing this book and possibly revealing sensitive information that might disclose the identities of SEAL Team 6 and put them in further danger, but it is a good book.  I have the utmost respect for our military and enjoy reading true accounts and this book was not a disappointment.  Highly reccommend it.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|DVD set was shipped quickly, and thus far I have had no problems with the disks. The season itself has also been good up to this point, I still have not finished the season yet.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I got this for my son as he loves animals. I seen it on the discovery channel quite some time ago and he was so excited to see the animals. The one thing to note that this a different commentator then the one on the discover channel. I actually preferd this man's voice over the female. Just like the show on the discovery channel it great series. Its also nice to have it in blu-ray for the clairity.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was full of adventure and suspense. I highly recommend this book<br />It's a great book !!!!
B0028RXXE8|1.0|Missing the last 5 discs of the 'complete series'. Also packaged with insufficient packing - package broken. In spite of this the contents appeared to be complete due to internal original packaging.  However, inspection upon receipt found five missing discs.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I saw it near the 50 shades books and it looked like a good read.  I was a fast book to read and it was hard to put it down. I would highly recommend this book esp if you like the 50 Shades of Grey series.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|To gamehouse is greedy with this one is an understatement.  Whether intended or not they are attempting to capatalize on a beloved franchise to make extra cash.  Rather then produce a decent game.  Lets start with the need to force players to bring more players in.  While I have friends who socialize.  Most are not game players.  So as an individual I find it annoying enough these games require you to &quot;add friends&quot;.  but this game takes it one step too far by making it so you HAVE to in order to earn &quot;hearts&quot; which are required for upgrades.  Worse yet 50 to 60% of items offered require you to spend Cash .  including mining while making these dollars ONLY accessible by buying them or by using a well established &quot;free&quot; system that is notal always free (and I should add earns them money with every site you visit,  and a lot more then you would think.)  while I do not begrudge programmers earning a living.  I find it an unreasonable practice to do such at the expense of the gamers. as such I warn.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.  IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL OREGON TRAIL.
B007J2R4MO|3.0|Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season (Limited Edition House Targaryen Sigil Packaging)is the same as the set available without the Targaryen Sigil on the cover. I had expected a little bit more for the extra money spent and was disappointed when the box arrived and the only difference is the Sigil on the front. Will not waste the extra money in the future.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|It's the Walking Dead...If you watch the show you know!  It's that good!  My advice to anyone who has not (even if you hate zombie movies like me) is watch the first season for free and then buy the second and third....you will buy the second and third as it \\"is\\" that \\"good\\".  The only reason I watched the pilot was to see the area I live in and see if they messed up on the footage...ha ha..jokes on me, I was hooked first half hour...so was the entire family (we don't like slasher/zombie movies!!!)!  Great show, great premise, great actors,...thanks AMC for showing just how lame network TV truly is.
B008MM9630|5.0|I have been playing nonstop for hours.. very addicting and super cute :) you wont be disappointed if you download it
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I couldn't put it down, now I want a sequel. I want to know what happened to Jacob and Reneesme. The Voltari have to get back involved with all the Cullens now that Aro's curiousity has been stirred up. This just can't be the end. More, More, More....
B009KKLQKO|1.0|I saw the Beach Boys at Wembley Arena, London at the end of September and the concert was filmed. British music DVDs are generally well filmed with good audio. Hopefully when released this DVD will include the whole concert and should be a lot better than this U.S. rip-off.
0316228532|5.0|I have to admit that I was skeptical about this book.  I wasn't sure that J.K. Rowling could write a story for adults that would be worth reading.  I am glad to say that I was wrong.  It is a powerful story that will stay with you long after you read it.  It is obvious that J.K. Rowling really knew what she was writing about.<br /><br />It is not a book for children and it was never marketed for children.  It is for adults.  Don't bother reading if you expect this book to be similar to the Harry Potter series.  Do read this book if you enjoy reading works from authors who are truly talented and on top of their game.  I cannot recommend this book enough.
B0054W4JQK|2.0|After seeeing so many reviews for this book I purchased it without reading them......big mistake. Like many others who have reviewed this book I found the story to be incredibly repetitive and silly, I didn't even finish reading it. If you are looking for a book that is suspenseful and has a gripping story, you will be highly disappointed. I do not write reviews normally but when asked what I thought of this book I felt compelled to voice my thoughts. I really wanted to be taken on a journey that would keep me intrigued but unfortunately that did not happen.
0385334206|5.0|As relevant today as it was when it was written. Breakfast of Champions tells of a story of 2 individual's paths that are destined to cross.<br />Satire at it's best, made me laugh so many times.<br /><br />This is a easy read, and not as dark as some of Vonneguts other books, like sirens of titan or mother night.<br /><br />I don't consider this one of Vonnegut's masterpieces like Slaughterhouse 5, Sirens of Titan, Cats Cradle and Mother night, but it's definitely a fun read
B0098VXBIA|4.0|This was a funny movie to watch with your spouse. It wasn't too cheesy for my husband to watch with me- only alone was he not able to bring himself to watch it through.
B008NABUU8|5.0|We have people on here giving 1 star reviews because they don't know how to change Amazons download settings? I downloaded this game using 3g and would not give the developer a low score on their game because i wasn't smart enough to change Amazons download settings that protects me from carrier overage charges.  OT: Game is great, graphics are smooth and crisp.
0316228532|5.0|Excellent peace of work from JK. She hasn't lost her touch at all. The book showed itself very interesting and I'm pretty sure every fan of the author will like it with no doubt.
B009KKNMEC|5.0|The best show on TV right now, in my opinion. The writers rock!! They know how to blend suspense, comedy, and romance without \\"jumping the shark.\\" That's a hard combination to achieve.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|used to work, now only loads 10 post,then the rest are just grey and blue text. unistalled and installed and still having issues. PLEASE FIX
B008JDAC7G|4.0|This is one of those games that is easy to learn but hard to master.  Lots going on visually and the sounds are zany.  High replay value.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app is awesome. Sitting wait for anything bring it up and read some favorite scriptures. Having a bad day look up some spiritual healing. Book marks for favorites. Easy reference guide.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|reminds me of a game on facebook. called pioneer trails. loved that game. now l can play a game like that on my kindle awesome.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|i heard KISS in 1974 on a 8-track with Slade my brother<br />had in his car. I was blown away by Strutter and Black<br />Diamond and Nothing to Lose. I went to the record store<br />and saw Hotter than Hell cover and was hooked. Like most<br />KISS fans even Dynasty and Unmasked were good not great<br />albums and The Elder which now seems pretty good was<br />not back then! Creatures of the Night brought them back<br />to the real KISS thanx to Vinnie Vincent and LICK it<br />up was a good follow up! The 80's were well the 80's<br />and Hot in the Shade kinda of picked up where Lick it<br />up left off and back to basic KISS. Revenge was the best<br />of the late 80's 90's and then Psycho Circus was a good<br />enough album with the title track and Ace's awesome Into<br />the Void. Sonic Boom was a good comeback more early KISS<br />and kinda Paul solo mix. Monster is not a monster. It's<br />not the follow up to Sonic Boom. It's not the cousin of<br />Destroyer! The single hell or ? is a 80's Paul song.<br />The rest is a mix mash of 80's 90's type stuff. Nothing<br />sounds like Classic KISS except All for the Love of Rocks<br />n Roll which is a rehash mr.speed riff but sounds like The Boss!<br />instead of early KISS. Eric's vocal is okay but Gene and Paul should've<br />done the vocals. Gene has some good songs and riffs but the chorus<br />are not strong! The only KISS classic is Wall of Sound! 80's sounding.<br />Tommy's Out of this World is not bad just kind lame! enough writing<br />Ace type songs. Nobody thinks he's Ace. He's good and does Ace's<br />lead style great but Ace is gone just be the spaceman and sing<br />shock me! that's what the fans want! Paul's songs are the biggest<br />surprise! The last album was much more like Paul this sounds like<br />songs from carnival of souls era and some of the lyrics are lame<br />been there done that before. and how many times do they say YEAH?<br />the monster logo looks like the energy drink logo! was that on purpose?n purpose?
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Awful casting, Bad writing, disjointed. Watched once that was enough. Story doesn't flow characters are incredibly stupid for people who are supposed to be smart. Good special effects.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|They release this what a couple days after the premium version comes out really rovio really?and why don't they release free versions of other games like angry birds space or how about the release a free version of the next angry birds angry birds star wars which by the way comes out the first week of November (November 6th I think) well now that that's over rovio please start thinking about the timing of your release dates
B007THA4FI|3.0|Up until the end, I found it difficult to keep track of the abundant number of characters in this book.  The end seemed as though Rowling just ran out of ink.... Disappointing read.  I expected much better.
B0001XAS2G|4.0|I enjoy the title track and others. Easy listening for a tranquil nostalgic day. I have a vivid memory hearing the title track not too far from Monument Valley which is on the cover art. Interesting coincidence.
0446693804|5.0|This was the sweetest most adorable book I've read so far. I read it in one day not being able to put it down. It is a must for anyone that's a sucker for love stories. Obviously!<br />I loved it
B007HXL1V0|5.0|The book explains in a very simple and easy way how to interact with your children if they start having different types of fights. Great for moms with children of all ages. If you can read it while still small because that way you already have the resources to have a more peaceful family.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie!  Lots of action and humor.  Great streaming video and audio from Amazon. My kids and grandkids didn't get up and wander around like when they watch one of my movies.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|pretty good..but I think if it's more difficult, then it's better. I just took about 7hrs to finish all the games.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am totally enjoying this game.  I put off rating this game because I was in too much of a hurry to get back to the game! Hope to see more apps like this one. Bring them on!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Each season of SOA keeps getting better, with the tension ratcheting up and up.  I recommend the show to just about everyone.
B005NWHE0O|5.0|As a recreational athlete and an avid traveler I identified immediately with the author of this book. The early childhood moments were well written and I really enjoyed the detailed recollections. The author's upbringing reminded me of my own. Tough yet fair parents who teach their children valuable traits through actions and also make their kids struggle just enough to learn how to cope with adversity later on in life. When children are allowed enough freedom at an early age to experience life without too much hand holding I really think they are better prepared to accomplish more. Later on when the author then relates his experiences in Europe and Australia I found myself unable to stop reading. I pretty much read this book in 2 reading sessions and did not even glance down at the percent meter on my Kindle more than once or twice. I found myself mashing the touch screen of my Kindle Fire for the next page a few times before I sadly realized I reached the end. I look forward to more from Walter Rhein!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a hit for the family!  Lots of mystery and suspense.  Great acting and of course smooth delivery to the big screen.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game....it keeps me busy, day in and day out. I try to get all my friends to join in.
1451626657|5.0|Heller is a modern Job, yelling at G-d, complaining to G-d, crying and laughing. His book is scary. Life has no meaning, it is Snowden or Sweden. It is our world that is insane, this is why we laugh insanely in order to stay sane. Heller: life is hell. Yossarian: what's the hell! Milo: is there a demand for Egyptian cotton in hell?<br />I would recommend Every Man's edition of the book - it has a great introduction by a Canadian (or maybe British) schalor. By the way, a customer put a picture of the hard cover Every Man on the Amazon - that one with the Heller's photo.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I love this music.  I have his both albums and love to play them loud in the car.  Our two kids ages 11 and 9 request them over and over and I'm happy to oblige.  Mayer, keep it coming!!!!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Another great season for the Vampire Diaries!!  As always, the series had an excellent plot, characters with depth, and nail biting tension. Left me hanging for season 4!
B007U4DIM6|3.0|I love the spunkyness if these little pooches.  The plot is easy for children to follow and I liked the ending of the film.  It was very intertaining.  THank you.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Only thing that could've been better was Hawkeye. Wrong actor and attitude to me. But other than that it was a good movie.  The hulk was awesome!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was easy reading and the storyline was very nice to read.  I actually predicted the ending but that's okay...I do that a lot!  I would recommend it.
0195073401|5.0|This is the best book of microeconomic theory ever. This graduated book gives to readers the generalities of microeconomics and shows in a formal way with mathematics.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great, colorful, strategic game that tests your quick thinking and your planning smarts! its easy to get started and gradually gets more and more difficult! a graleat game to pass the time but its not mind numbing! and its free!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought this to go with the Kershaw knife I bought for my husband for his birthday.  He is very hard on his knives and I thought an easy to use sharpener would be nice... He is a traditionalist when it comes to sharpening, a stone and oil, so I wasn't sure this sharpener would work for him, but he LOVED it.. I watched him use it and in just a few seconds he had his older Kershaw blade sharp as new.  He was thrilled.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Rock of Ages is a musical based around a simple story of two young people and their dreams of becoming rock and roll singers.  They meet, fall in love, and work at a troubled rock bar called The Bourbon.  Tom Cruise plays the older rock star, Stacy Jaxx, who is breaking off from his original band and plays at the Bourbon, interacting with the other characters.<br /><br />Overall the movie was fun to watch, with all of the actors impressively singing their parts.  All of the songs are familiar to those of us who grew up in the 80's, and it's quite fun to listen to the new interpretations and scenes.<br /><br />Ultimately a weak, cliched story, but the music made it quite enjoyable.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love the 3D Blu-Ray, it is fantastic visually and my friends are wowed by it.  Definitely entertaining as it could be.
B0087HT36U|4.0|my  young boys loved the weapons of destruction.  many woo hoo filled times playing.  i liked the way killed off characters were shown.
B008K3HRF0|3.0|Part of the movie is fuzzy like I'm supposed to wear 3d glasses with. I am unhappy about the clarity of this movie.I love this movie to death by the way.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am not even 3/4 of the way through this book, but I cannot put it down.  Very well written and, obviously, one that keeps the reader's attention.  So far, loving it!
1439153663|5.0|I have spent many nights that turned into mornings reading. But, I have never felt compelled to reread a book at 2 am. As it was I should have just started rereading because I didn't fall asleep until the wee hours anyways just thinking about this story.  It is a page turner like nothing else I've read.  Everyone who wanted to borrow this book will have to wait until I'm done \\"again\\".
034580404X|4.0|Purchased the books because of all the controversy, wanted to see what the fuss is about. Expected it to be worse, but it was a pleasant read. Nothing amazing, but was really captured by 1st two books, currently reading the 3rd. Sometimes it would get predictable and repetitive, but keep your mind open and it will make sense. Definitely do not see it becoming a classic, but it raised questions and conversations and that what the book should do. Was it great? No. But again - I was not expecting it to be.
1932735410|5.0|I was affraid it would be another of those books that I couldn't go further than 20 pages. It surprised me, though - the language it uses, the exercizes, the way the subject is presented, everything about this book is carefully planned so the test taker is motivated to go through all chapters the 3 times it recommends. I am very happy that I finally found an effective way to get prepared to the exam!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is an awesome game for passing the time. It requires very little skill and is quite enjoyable. The different levels and collecting the prizes are the best parts.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This movie is still scary years later and always will be. Who would think a movie made with a 300,000 dollar budget, young cast and a white masked killer could make a definite horror classic film. With all that said, it does work and gives us this masterpiece of a horror film. Even though it doesn't have any blood or gore like films today, it will stand the test of time and will be seen by many generations of horror film fans!
B008NABUU8|4.0|Works great on both my nexus 7 quad core CPU/ 12 core GPU tablet as well as 2 off brand single core $99 tablets that I previously had. Great graphics, best and easiest to  use bridge building game I have found thus far! Only wish they had more unique builds and some unlimited budget builds to play with when you finish. I have not got to the last island yet, so it could have such without me knowing yet. I know there is another bridge game that has an unlimited budget section to mess with, but that game is much less refined and has some issues. This game would be 5 stars if they added a little more as suggested. But I still love the game!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I really liked the character development, and setting. Not as realistic as I would have liked though in some areas of the story.  Great ending though!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is really an addiction. Everyone who plays this app will like it. Its for all ages as well. Very happy with this free app.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|It may be different than previous albums but it is very good. It's still the same Muse that everyone loves. I would recommend it to anyone.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Great item at an wesome price through amazon as well.  Definitely going to be buying more of these in the future. As with all Melissa and Doug items, very well made.
0439023491|5.0|I've read all 3 books in the Hunger Games trilogy and I have to say, Catching Fire is definitely my favorite. I think the beginning is a lovely transition from the end of the Hunger Games and it starts the way everyone expected it to. Everyone has moved on from the games. Katniss and Peeta are now victors with more money than they could ever need, but things aren't the same. Now that they're back in District 12 things get awkward because Gale is there and Katniss is really confused with Gale and Peeta. President Snow however makes a surprise visit to Katniss's house where he instructs her to calm down the districts or her cousin Gale will be killed.<br />  So here comes the backlash of act with the berries in the arena as Katniss and Peeta go on their victory tour. They get off to bad start for their well-being in District 11, the district Rue and Thresh were from. After Katniss gives her speech to Rue and Thresh's families a man whistles the four note tune used as a signal in the arena. Then in perfect unison, everyone gives the sign of goodbye also used in the arena. With 3 fingers to the lips and then to the sky a spark is lit. This even though it's small, is an act of dissent from the citizens. Katniss and Peeta see the old man be shot in the head and they then realize they must make their love so overwhelmingly great that it caused them to resolve to eat the berries. They must show it was not rebellion; it was love overpowering their thought process. When they make it to the Capital towards the end of their victory tour, Katniss and Peeta meet the next Head Gamemaker, Plutarch Heavensbee. He shows her his gold watch with a mockingjay on it. This seems strange to Katniss and for good reason because he is foreshadowing an important part of the new arena to her.<br />  I don't want to give away anymore because this book truly is a page turner. There are so many unexpected twists and the capital never seems to run of terrifying ideas. The next games are the Quarter Quell because it is the 75th anniversary of the games and the Capitol intends to make it a very special and unique Quarter Quell.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was an excellent book! Thus far, I hadn't been as impressed with this (Heroes of Olympus) series as much as I was with Percy Jackson and the Olympians, but Rick Riordan has really tied it all together very well. Can't wait for the next one coming in Fall of 2013!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Was alittle disapointed in this book.  The first one was so good----this one didn't hold my interest at all.  It wasn't exciting enough, too predictable.
0425263908|5.0|If your looking for a book to read after 50 Shades of Grey, this is it. I read it in 3 nights, which is a record for me. Loved it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just love this game. Our whole family is addicted and we love racing and challenging each other. What a great way to spend time with my son.
1611761565|5.0|What a great Book so refreshing to hear the actual accounts of what really happen the truth not some media hype or government spin.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|I'm so feeling this album. It'd definitely one that could go on repeat for months. My Favorite tracks are: Without Your Love, Hanging On (Full), Atlantis, Don't Say A Word, and I Need Your Love! This album I'm sure will do very well!
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I would have given this 5 stars as I purchased the app for my Motorola Electrify. I upgraded my phone to the Samsung S3 and now I get a message that SwiftKey had to close before it would even open. Bummer that I paid for it and now can't use it. No info from Amazon or TouchType about the incompatibility???
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|I've had a number of beard trimmers through the years and have had a beard since about '94<br />This one is really cool because of the levels of trim available.The only thing I dont like<br />is the read out of the legnths , its very hard to determine what it is.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book starts slow, the first chapter does not capture the reader but if you stick with it, it does get better. It gets good enough that I bought book 2 and 3. I'm not a \\"romance novel\\" type reader but the mental part is interesting to me. Christian Grey IS 50 shades of crazy! I think Ana is way too naive...not believable. It's funny that the crazy one is more believable!!
B0096CDG0O|3.0|i was able to log in after i uninstalled the facebook app i downloaded from the amazon app store after u do that u can reinstall facebook app
0525952926|5.0|I can't get enough of the way that Follett weaves together multiple stories and characters spanning across the world at war.  I feel like I learn so much from reading his historical fictions.  He is well-researched, brilliant, and has a real gift for making you fall in love (or hate) with the characters.  The story line is captivating, and I don't want to put the book down!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game.  It took a little patience to accumulate coins, but I already have over 10,000.  There are also a lot of play options.
B000002JKS|2.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"Little By Little\\". I love that song. The bass line is one of the best in rock history. It is right up there with the creativity of Geddy Lee's bass lines.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is nothing like it. In fact, it's as if you're listening to a Miami Vice episode soundtrack. It dripping in 1985.<br /><br />I agree that fans either will love or hate this CD. I am undecided. It's one of those CD's that probably has to be listened to at the right place at the right time. To me, driving is always best, but I haven't felt nostalgic enough for the 80's to be so enthusiastic about it.<br /><br />Paul Martinez, the bass player on this album, is the saving grace. How have I not heard of this guy before ? His bass lines are incredibly memorable and thoughtful. He doesn't take the least path of resistance.<br /><br />Other than that, the rabbit hasn't jumped out of the black hat yet for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I cant tell you how much time ive wasted on pinterest. and I'm not mad. probably the most entertaining , fun and time consuming apps ever. I will suggest pinterest anytime someone tells me they are bored. I will even suggest when they are not bored. pinterest makes me believe God exists. I couldn't of anything id rather be doing, ever. I am in love with this app.
B000I0QL82|5.0|You can't miss with Bing... Veiwing this vintage movie is one of the seasonal threads that helps bond our family together.
B005GYGCOI|4.0|I read some books  before lonely planet INDIA, I found in Lonely Planet INDIA the best reference  for  travel. Of  course is  always easiest to read  maps  and take  notes in traditional book, but for me  I found good to  have a ebook because what I wanted was reduce weight in my bag,,,  after few  days  I  get  use to read  the  digital map  and  references in different pages,,  get  use  to make  book marks and take digital notes. I would recommend  this  ebook.
B008QTV3X0|1.0|This show deserves no awards.  It is a uses porn to sell it.  I bought it because Danes won an award.  I want my money back.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|This new album is very good...even though alot of it is commercial sounding, its still an awesome album! The first release Still Swinging is like there old stuff, the rest of it is different but good...
B009NPKTN6|5.0|The songs are unbelievable in how close they come to the original. Please remember these are not the original artists. however, Mary J Blige is the worst singer of the whole cast. The others harmonize or as in Giamatti's case do not sing much.  Mary j Blige sings over the others as a stripper with a vengeance. The movie is very blue in it's outlook. Please do not allow children below a certain age to watch this they will become confused, Cruise, Baldwin and Brand steal the limelight and justifiably so. A Great Romp.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever don't even tink about it just buy it its good its worth seven bucks in a flash
B004N6369Y|4.0|Fans of Danielle Steel will enjoy this book.  The story line is predictable, but the setting is interesting.  Although the characters and plot are not especially complex, the hotel is the dominating element of the book.  The creation of a five star hotel is a good story in itself.  This book is an easy, fun read. If you're looking for intellectual stimulation and deep insights, look elsewhere.  If you just want to get away from it all, go to the Hotel Vendome.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's obvious the writer did years of reserch on the story of HENRIETTA LACKS.  I really enjoyed the story and found the book and started reading it on Oct 4, 2012.  The 51st anniversary of her death.  I wish the family well and appreciate the miracle of her cells.
B006MW3VC4|5.0|This British Series is done with excellent writing and acting at the highest level. I will continue watching this series on television and Blu-Ray formats. The Blu-Ray versions are of the highest quality of video and  5.1 sound.  PBS/BBC have given us extraordinary entertainment.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|best movie ever! :) go and buy it now! it is worth every darn penny you'll pay. the gag reel is hilarious and the one-shot is superb too!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Other reviewers have expressed my feelings more humorously and succinctly than I have the time or interest to do right now. Finally slogged to the end last night and totally missed whatever redemption there was. I'm not looking for frilly and frothy, but don't relish picking up rocks to look at the slimy mess underneath. I just led a book club discussion of Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and loved the sick intricacies of Nick and Amy's relationship. Yes, we all have ugly thoughts and motivations and it's horrifying to see where they can lead.<br /><br />Great writing, of course, no question about Rowling's talent. But, surely, there's a middle ground between fantasy and depressing ugliness.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Johnny Depp is an amazing actor, and that is why I downloaded this movie from Amazon. It was good. However, I never read up on this movie, and I had never seen the trailer. I went into it blind, and I did not know what to expect. It's a funny movie.  Take it for the laughs and just have a good time watching it. It's not a serious movie, only fun.
B003TOH8AE|5.0|Great movie about a kid who wants to be a super hero and a kid that really is a super hero.  Excellent movie.  Excellent entertainment.
1454701250|5.0|Love this book and this creative process.<br /><br />I started making stamps with Geninne Zlatkis' templates. From there, I looked for designs on the web. Today, I picked up an oak leaf on my daily walk...and it inspired me to make a stamp.<br /><br />I think this is just the beginning!
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|Gary Clark Jr. (skilled guitarist and fellow Texas homie) has been on the music scene for a number of years now. Finally, he hits a homerun and scores a breakthrough with 'Blak and Blu'. He released an EP last year that contains a few songs that were nicely re-recorded for this release. The entire album is stellar, but here are some comments about my favorite tracks:<br /><br />~\\"The Life\\" - My favorite song on the CD and probably my favorite of any artist this year. It's a sincere exercise of introspection and a bright and hopeful gaze toward a better life. I can easily hear a *true* hip-hop artist contributing some meaningful verses to a remix.<br /><br />~\\"You Saved Me\\" - An apparent ode to his muse, this one sounds like something Prince would have done. The guitar work is killer!<br /><br />~\\"Things Are Changin'\\" - The voice distortion gives a nice touch to this acknowledgement of two lovers at a crossroads.<br /><br />~\\"Travis County\\" - A fun salute to the rock and blues of the late 50s/early 60s (a la  Chuck Berry), Gary renders a tale of a short stint in the Travis County jail.<br /><br />~\\"Bright Lights\\" - With a justifiable confidence that is irresistible, he sings, \\"you're gonna know my name.\\" No doubt about it! The guitar solo kicks muchass!<br /><br />~\\"Next Door Neighbor Blues\\" - A old, wooden porch, overalls delight of a gem. I can't wait to  hear this one live in concert!<br /><br />Blak and Blu is one of the best CDs of the year! Obviously, I gravitate to his more mid-tempo songs. But Gary Clark Jr.'s eclecticism and musical gifts should appeal to a wide range of people with (what I consider) great taste in music. I don't know the first thing about guitar, but I know good music when I hear it. Blak and Blu is outstanding!
B008NABUU8|1.0|! You have been Warned ...<br />Also freezes on my Fire.<br />Good concept. but after a few bridges built. stalled out on the 4th task.  Screen locked so had to shut down and reboot.  So be warned.  Seems this gllich should. have. been found earlier by the app's creator.  For Fire users hold the off button in for about 30 sec. then restart and delete. the app.
B008MEM24S|5.0|The levels are entertaining and challenging. Its one of the more enjoyable physics games I've found. Sounds and graphics are fun, too.
1455113549|5.0|I found this novel, if that what it is, disturbing thanks to the author, William Landay, and the audio book reader, Grover Gardner. The author develops the charters, the plot and the settings with great care and skill. Excellence from start to finish with multiple surprises throughout.
B002APU580|5.0|PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is beautifully filmed. Excellent costumes and locations. The acting and directing are right on. I recommend this movie to everyone. Much more than a love story.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Very addicting and time consuming. Don't play unless you plan to invest time! Love it! Be sure to garner lots of neighbors to boost yourself to higher levels faster though.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Okay lets face it, in most shows the events that occur aren't real. The good guy doesn't save the day at the last second, nor does the couple fall happily in love. For the most part that's okay because we watch shows to escape from reality. Ever now and then however, it's nice to see a show that grasp the idea of entertainment while being realistic. Games of Thrones is an amazing show that brings forth all the real aspect of what life was back then.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|There are going to be hundreds of reviews of this album out there (and yes, I'm old, I still call them albums) and I know I'm not in Taylor's main demographic audience.  First off, I'm a guy.  Second off I'm 42 years old and normally listen to things like Irish punk, The Beatles, Springsteen or some hard core country like Chris Knight.  I love big band music whether it's Frank Sinatra or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.  With all of that said, I adore Taylor and this new album \\"Red.\\"<br /><br />Taylor's songwriting is still in fine form here.  The thing that always amazes me about her writing is that she's able to tell stories in her songs, she keeps it simple and more often than not finds one heck of a hook in the chorus.  There is passion, there's energy and there is joy.  Sure, there are so sad songs, but it seems to my that Taylor takes so much joy in making music that it's hard as a listener not to get caught up in that with her.<br /><br />After listening to the 16 tracks and the 6 bonus tracks available on some packages I have to say that Taylor's bonus tracks alone are better than what most artists are putting out as albums these days.  The \\"demo\\" recordings of \\"Treacherous,\\" \\"Red\\" and \\"State of Grace\\" are excellent and polished works that are just a bit more stripped down than the versions that appear on the album.  It's not really fair to call them demos, as when I hear that word I'm expecting below-par sound and performance.  I think it's the mark of a good song if it can be done solo-acoustic (or at least very stripped down) and these three songs certainly hold up well.<br /><br />For me the whole album is very solid, there are no songs on this disc that I'd skip when listening to it.  There is a nice mix of slower ballads and hard hitting rock numbers.  Make no mistake about it, Taylor Swift is a rock and roll star.  She's setting the bar for what pop music is and doing a fine job of it.  It's funny, while listening to \\"Red\\" and the big anthmatic numbers I couldn't help but think this is the modern day version of Phil Spector's wall of sound.  Sure, there are a lot of synthesizers here, but Taylor has an uncanny ability to create a big sound that just envelops you, especially if you like to play your music as loud as I do.<br /><br />I think it's the fact that Taylor is such a good songwriter and maybe more importantly storyteller that makes her so accessible across so many different lines.  It doesn't matter how old you are or what gender you are, Taylor's songs resonate.  Even a song like \\"22\\" which is an anthem for the young \\"let's go out and party\\" crowd it still hits home with me at 42, because believe it or not kids I was 22 at one point.  And, I'm guessing the 10 year olds that hear the song will relate to it because they know it's exactly what they're going to want to do when they're 22.<br /><br />Red is a little bit country, a lot of pop and a heavy dose of rock and roll.  Like some big artists before her, Taylor Swift is not a follower, but instead she is creating the standard for what is popular music.  And maybe this is the old man in me coming out, but where most of popular music is fairly brainless and devoid of substance that's the opposite of what Taylor Swift brings to the table.  She brings some great story songs, most of which (if not all) I'm pretty sure are very auto-biographical.  Taylor is simply telling us her story, she's just making it rhyme and adding some killer hooks and melodies for good measure.t help but think this is the modern day version of Phil Spector's wall of sound.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game and I don't have to spend any money playing.  My husband and daughter downloaded it last night.5+ stars.
0345529057|5.0|This man makes Steve Moffat and Joss Whedon look cuddly. He will Kill every character you love and make you love him.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book series for any teen or advanced pre teen reader. Easy to download on my kindle app for IPad as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is easy to use. The battery gauge is clear and provides simple visual of battery use.<br /> The potential battery life for uses is also provided. I am very satisfied.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last book had a great ending and overall the book was a fast and easy read. I totally recommend this series to my girlfriends but it is waaaaaaay too racey for my mother-in-law!
B003CW67TQ|5.0|I just finished this book and am seriously hooked!I had heard about the author from a friend and am so glad I was directed to The Snowman.The only thing  I regret is that I couldn't have started from the first Harry Hole book which has yet to be translated.(Now I am committed to going back to the first books available in English.)It is always a good thing to discover an author you enjoy who has several books published and you know exactly what to expect. I know I enjoy the author but I have to say you really cannot predict anything.The twists and turns leave you reeling with anticipation as you turn the pages-or click your kindle! Loved it!
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|The third day I had this app a message came up stating: The application Weather + has stopped unexpectedly.  Please try again.  I have tried several times ( more that 5) and still get the same message.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I'm not the type of person who makes superlatives often. However, with that said, this book nails it.  If you ever want to understand what makes people, and most importantly yourself, tick, then read this book.  Whenever I find myself eyeing an extra piece of candy, or thinking about not doing the extra rep in the weight room because it hurts, or not putting the little extra effort in for a work presentation, I think of which \\"habit loop\\" I want to be in, and generally and fortunately opt for the more rewarding loop.  This is a great book, and a must for anyone who want to better him or herself.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Despite being a little slow it completely immerse you in the world of the Seven Kingdoms and  it's one of those stories you can just stop reading!
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I'm not vegan, nor even close, but this book has caused me to rethink my eating.  Great story too.  Worth the read even for someone not interested in a plant based diet.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|My husband and I were very pleased with our order of Stargate SG 1 and we have ordered up to season 6 so far. We have gotten our entertainment value out of them. They were delivered on time and the whole Amazon experience is just so easy. I haven`t run into a bad apple yet as the saying goes. Thank you Amazon and the different sellers we have used.<br />Mrs. Sandra Merz
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Best of all the movies in this genre.  A lot of action with subtle humor that kept the movie flowing.  This movie wasn't filmed in 3D, so there are few remarkable 3D effects...the credits had the best 3D impact. Not necessary, but for just a few dollars more than the non 3D version, it was worth adding to the library.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Incredible tale of \\"protect and serve\\" gone mad and the choices made that result in way too much carnage of which the director is well known.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I had already seen the movie, so I knew the content would be good.  The product I ordered, though, arrived on time, in one piece, and was a great price for the ability to play the movie on that many formats!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|My 6 year grandsons can't put this game down. Lots of fun and the graphics are great.  I find myself humming the tunes!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read most of Ken Follett's works and enjoyed them all.<br /><br />I am anxious for the third book in this trilogy.  How Long must I wait?
B00846REIS|3.0|This book is alright, I thought that it was a bit over the top and explicit, but I still read it and bought the sequel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Using it on the Galaxy S III and love the app. I the advertisements at the top aren't too distracting.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I am anxiously awaiting day three!  Rothfuss compels one to both think and feel deeply!  Day one and two were equally as compelling!
B001RJTFP4|5.0|Great Movie! Could watch it a thousand times. Love that I could rent it and watch it on my XBox at home.
0486275590|5.0|Any of the dover classic edition paperbacks are great stocking stuffers, economical, and it is always my policy to encouraging reading<br />to young people. This review is either for Treasure Island or A Christmas Carol. Both are books I highly recommend as reading to<br />any pre teen, teen or adult.
B0086700CM|3.0|Takes forever to load and then freezes while you are in the middle of a game and you die. Not just my experience but others I have takes to had experienced the same.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE FOR KIDS AND ADULTS,IT BRING BACK THE MAGIC OF CHRISTMAS FOR EVERYONE! BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT !
B008XNZMOU|4.0|For album number four, Taylor Swift crosses over even more to the Pop side. Opening with thundering beats and sweeping guitar sounds is \\"State Of Grace\\". Title track \\"Red\\" starts off with some folky guitar with a stuttery \\"R-r-r-ed\\" punctuating the chorus, while \\"Treacherous\\" is a Coldplay-style anthem that builds and builds.<br /><br />\\"I Knew You Were trouble\\" finds her experimenting with shuddering Dubstep breaks. Have no fear, she doesn't want to be the next Skrillex, it's a great little Rocker. Other upbeat numbers are the bouncy \\"22\\", the sassy lead-single \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" (which is catchy Power Pop Katy Perry would kill for), the unabashed Country bounce of \\"Stay Stay Stay\\" (a fun song with the lyrics \\"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night, I threw my phone across the room at you, I was expecting some dramatic turn away, But you stayed, This morning I said we should talk about it, Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved, That's when you came in wearing a football helmet, And said okay let's talk...\\"), the pulsing Rocker \\"Holy Ground\\", and the shimmery \\"Starlight\\" (with a lovely ballad intro).<br /><br />However, it's on the ballads she truly shines. The chiming pulsing \\"All Too Well\\", \\"The Last Time\\" (a dark and hushed duet with Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody with truly spectacular results), the tender \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\" (an acoustic Country/Folk number), \\"The Lucky One\\" (with interesting percussion), \\"Everything Has Changed\\" (a mellow duet with UK Pop/Folk/Hip Hop singer Ed Sheeran perfectly harmonizing with Swift), and the absolutely enchanting quivery \\"Begin Again\\" ending things on a suitable high note.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I had been awaiting this book after reading the first one.  It was just as good as I anticipated it would be and now I have to wait again for the next one.  Hope it comes out really soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very captivating book. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has read Hunger Games or if you have just seen the movie. Plan on reading the last book in the series “Mockingjay“. This book will leave you hungry for more...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Oh my gosh! What a book! you could feel the passion and control, almost to the point of making me mad. I would recommend this to everyone except my mother!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Took forever to get to reading this book- but once I did- I couldn't put it down. Several novels in one, such a great twist each time. The movie is going to be great.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Please get it for kindle Fire, this app is amazing. I would give it 5 stars if it was on kindle fire...
1476715904|5.0|I absolutely loved Slammed.  I cried and laughed and found much enjoyment in the story of Lake and Will!  A must read.  Colleen, please don't stop writing.  I can't wait to read book #3 about Lake and Will!  Also... I found no errors in the Kindle edition - the first book in a while I've read without finding any errors!!! :D
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This movie can't be compared to anything else because there is nothing else like it. I loved every minute of this movie.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|it's very confortable to drive with my buddy, great recepcion and clear sound, and voice control works just fine<br /> I am pleased
B009SJ3LHI|4.0|After watching the first two eps I have to say I really enjoyed them. No real new story - very batmanesque - a lone hero trying to clean up a corrupt big city, complete with him even being a wealthy scion. Despite that similarity though, the show feels fresh and new and they have cast some good actors across the board.<br />It feels much more real than the Batman and other superhero movies and that it's a series means we'll get to see a new ep every week. Looking foreward to the next and hopefully many seasons more.
B00933U1EU|4.0|I didn't think Claire Daines would make a good spy, but she does. You'll forget who your watching after the first 20 minutes.  It's a complex thriller with nuanced acting and story, and at about an hour an episode, it's another show you have to dedicate your time to. How many shows can you spend and hour a week on? That's the question you have to ask before you watch too many episodes and get really hooked.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|This Trip Advisor is okay but I was really looking for a GPS App.  I haven't had much time to try it out yet.  It will probably be more beneficial for our next vacation next year.
B0074JODP8|5.0|I fell in love with Joe Bonamassa's riveting blues sound when I stumbled upon this concert on PBS one Saturday night.  He plays with such power and sweetness at the same time.  It's the new sound in my car wherever I'm going.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best FREE calculator app I've found for the kindle fire so far. It's very practical and comes in handy for everyday uses.
B0083F5J7S|5.0|Love, love, love it!!!!  Would buy more CDs by Maroon 5 any time. Need 8 more words.....love, love, love it!
B007THA4FI|1.0|The author should have stuck with the style of writing she did with Harry Potter. The book seems to go nowhere for several chapters and even then you want to say what was the point.<br />Very disappointed in this book.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Love, love, love it!!!!  Would buy more CDs by Train any time. Need 8 more words here.....love, love, love it!
B0040YFR1Y|1.0|Let's do this in list format, since this film is sort of designed to be nothing more than what it claims to be.<br /><br />The most serious problems of the film are:<br />- The so-called \\"elite killers\\" that go up against the Predators sure don't seem it, and that alone ruins the entire purpose for which most people saw this film, like me. They show little intelligence or experience, walk straight into traps, and neither talk nor think like someone used to killing for a living would do. They might as well have been nobodies given a gun, since they very rarely show any skill in what they're supposed to be able to do. Call me on it if I'm wrong, but are people such as these, who are said to be ruthless killing machines, usually not-so-eager to join up and become a ragtag group of buddies, really this nice and trusting among each other?<br />- Even though they realize what they are, where they are, and why they're there, not a single person questions the one person who claims to literally be the opposite of an elite killer: a freaking doctor who says he was on his way to work, who is totally unarmed the entire time, and is completely inept in combat. Seriously, not one of them thinks that's a little weird, even though they know the rest of them are acclimated to extreme violence and murder?<br />- Cool! Laurence Fishburne is an elite survivalist who's been doing this for ten of their hunting seasons and survived! Easily the most badass character in the group who actually knows what he's doing, unlike everyone else, you almost think he's going to save the movie from being as boring as it's been so far. Except...<br />- ...Fishburne instead gets maybe ten minutes total of screen time doing nothing but talking before being killed in a way that makes you wonder how he could have possibly lasted as long as he claims he did. Well, so much for Fishburne saving the movie as the only character who seems to have any idea what he's doing.<br />- Terribly generic musical score that lacks any suspense at all, so bad that it's worth noting. I'm not expecting an OST here, but come on. I don't think I'll ever understand why they chose an old happy dance song for the ending credits, which had nothing to do with anything that just happened. I was kind of expecting something a little more serious, not a cartoon, which is what it basically is.<br />- The death row inmate, apparently just a sexual predator (possibly an inside joke of sorts), who talks about doing cocaine and raping women for fun--well, you'd just kind of make the connection that he's probably a psychopath who is not nice to anyone. He probably wouldn't help out the team much, and if it were me, I'd have shot him first for clearly having no intentions of helping anyone out. Anyone who talks that crazy in front of everyone is not even a smart psychopath, so he's probably going to use any opportunity he can to let the Predators take everyone else, like a psychopath would tend to do before being killed himself. Instead, he ends up being...heroic? And genuinely nice from there on out? What? A serial rapist who probably killed at least one of his victims (it's never explicitly stated that he killed anyone, but he *was* on death row, so it's not exactly a stretch) ends up being heroic, the only one most likely to betray absolutely everyone at the drop of a hat?<br />- A laughably stereotypical Yakuza character who fakes not being able to speak English...dies in the most laughably stereotypical way imaginable.<br />- It just can't seem to take itself seriously. The majority of the film is our cast of people who seem to be picked at random and showing no skill at killing talking a whole lot.<br />- Everything about it is boring, from the characters to the environment to the Predators themselves. There just aren't any moments of real excitement.<br /><br />Also, as a last note, the trailer is a lie. Scenes are in the trailer that are not in the movie. The obvious emphasis on Laurence Fishburne, who does pretty much absolutely nothing except say a few lines before being killed off (apparently this film had an even lower budget than I imagined), is nothing short of deception in the advertising of the film. Audiences generally don't appreciate that kind of thing, although it's common.<br /><br />Definitely not recommended for absolutely anyone, even if you like the concept of it, Predator fan or not. Don't be drawn in by the great idea here; it doesn't actually occur in the film.

B001OFPKTG|5.0|I've always had a liking for Edgar Allan Poe, with his tales of horror, mystery and suspense, done in the atmospheric prose of a master writer. Since I live close enough, I've even made some trips to his gravesite, a place that is always surrounded by a sense of sadness.<br /><br />Poe was a tormented genius who died young, under mysterious circumstances, and at the time of his death he wasn't deservingly popular. Certainly his work was not cute romances for the masses -- he explored the darkness of the human heart, love, satire, and the earliest whodunnit stories. And \\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" brings together all of his poetry and writings in one book.<br /><br />Poe's fiction writings include short stories and novellas, which tend to be rather weird -- a treasure-hunt and a golden insect, a ship caught in a whirlpool, a hypnotized man talks about the universe, and stories of despair, madness, and occasionally beauty. There is also his trilogy of Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin stories, which were the first to feature a brilliant detective solving an impossible crime.<br /><br />Most people know about \\"The Raven\\" (which even has the Baltimore Ravens named after it) but Poe actually wrote a lot of poetry, most of which readers never heard of. Sometimes dark, or whimsical, or even both. \\"By a route obscure and lonely/Haunted by ill angels only/Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT/On a black throne reigns upright...\\"<br /><br />And, of course, the horror. This is what Poe is best known for, including such well-known stories as \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" But there are also lesser-known gems -- tales of a plague invading a party, being buried alive, a portrait that siphoned the life out of its subject, and a nightly visit to an Italian crypt leading to madness.<br /><br />Don't read \\"Complete Stories and Poems\\" all at once. It's too intense. It's better to soak it in a little at a time, so that you can get a better feel for the different kinds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper. Most great writers can't boast of that much.<br /><br />Poe's writing is what makes even his least story or poem come alive -- he brought a gothic, misty vibrancy to his stories, and could make his quiet dialogue seem utterly chilling (\\" \\"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit. I was mortal, but am fiend...\\"). It's not hard to see why he was an influence on authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and Franz Kafka.<br /><br />The Library of America edition is a lovely collection of Poe's work -- the paper is thin and of high quality, the binding is very strong, and great care has been made for this copy. It's expensive, but it's ideal for the serious, frequent Poe reader.<br /><br />\\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" is a must-have for anyone with an appreciation for great literature and beautiful, dark writing.that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper.

0982954328|4.0|\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.<br /><br />But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book. Solid work, and a good introduction to the Holmes series.cene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction.

1451696191|4.0|I liked this book.  The well-developed characters are real people that I came to know and like. The story unfolds as Charlie, the main character, writes a series of letters to someone the reader knows only as Dear friend. The letters gave me the feeling that I was stepping into Charlie's private world. I got to know Charlie, his family, and his friends and saw the world through his eyes.    Charlie is a sensitive, intelligent, and creative 15 year old high school freshman. He sees beauty in everyday objects and experiences and describes them so the reader feels it also. Yet Charlie is also troubled. He is a social misfit at school. His emotions are sometimes extreme and excessive. The suicide of his best friend, loss of a beloved aunt, and his brother leaving for college affect him deeply.    Charlie's friendship with two seniors - Patrick and Patrick's stepsister Sam - helps to change his life. He learns a lot about friendship, love, and being who you really are.  Without giving away too much of the story I can say that Charlie comes to understand what real love is and the frailty that is part of being human.  Caution - This book contains matures themes.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book is an enjoyable read.  It's been a couple (at least) years since I read the \\"Fall of Giants\\", but his book has seemed more engrossing.  The plot is somewhat predictable and Follet's leftist bias is a little annoying at times, but all in all it's a good read; just don't take it as an accurate historical account.

B0091REZMW|3.0|I like this game for its mystery seek and finds and its complexity. However i don't enjoy how much energy is used up after every room search and that you have to use diamonds to practically buy your way further into the game. I don't enjoy having to spend money on games like this. I like to earn my way in the game but they make it hard for you to do so when you can hardly earn any diamonds. I love the concept of this game though which is why I continue to play it.

B0090SVDO0|4.0|\\"We were going to blast the sound all the way down the hills to Hollywood\\".  Ray Manzarek.<br /><br />Here it is, 71 minutes of THE DOORS during their early (and arguably best) period in 1968.  The band wasn't allowed to play at the volume level they wanted (loud), so the overall recorded impression is ever so anemic compared to what they  were capable of.  But they knew this concert was so important, that they rehearsed beforehand.  And for once, all the talk about the sound being \\"the best ever\\" is pretty accurate.  The technical problems on three tracks-\\"When The Music's Over\\", \\"The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat)\\", and \\"Hello I Love You\\"-basically not having Morrison's vocals-have been \\"fixed\\".  In order to rescue the songs, in a carefully worded explanation, Morrison's vocals from the \\"Absolutely Live\\" set were used for these three tracks to \\"restore\\" the vocals on the CD.  Were these tracks left over from the tracks used for \\"Absolutely Live\\", but not used?  Is it \\"cheating\\"?  Well, maybe yes a bit.  But it does sound pretty good nonetheless.  And we now get to hear the complete concert.  There seems to be some confusion concerning the vocals for these three songs, so I've quoted them in the comments section to answer the question from \\"Avalon Don\\", to hopefully clear things up.<br /><br />The CD slips inside an envelope in a \\"bill-fold\\" style cardboard holder, along with the booklet, in the other edge.  The 10 page booklet has a short essay by Bruce Botnick about the recordings, plus there's a paragraph from each of the remaining band members, that bring back some of the flavor of those times.  There's also a list of the various microphones used, and related recording information.  Also included are a few images from the concert, photographed by Henry Diltz.<br /><br />But the music-whoa!  This is THE DOORS in their prime, putting it all out there.  Morrison's vocals are full of swagger and power. His command of the lyrics-the tone and the timing-have a visceral quality that makes other L.A. bands of that period sound like wimps.  But that's only part of the picture.  The instrumental firepower, coupled with a certain finesse when called for from Manzarek, Densmore, and Krieger, add  depth and excitement to Morrison's vocal timing and energy.<br /><br />From \\"Back Door Man\\", to \\"Hello, I Love You\\", to \\"Moonlight Drive\\" (listen to Krieger's guitar), to \\"Spanish Caravan\\", to (of course) \\"Light My Fire\\", and \\"The End\\", anyone who thinks THE DOORS was Jim Morrison and \\"backing band\\" will get a real wake up call.  Quite simply, the band play with the same intensity, the same sensitivity, the same intuitiveness, that Morrison uses vocally.  Just listen to \\"Horse Latitudes\\" for a good example of what THE DOORS sound like live, without a net.  And then listen to how well Morrison's poetry fits in so well with the other compositions.  But that kind of excitement runs all through this set-take your pick.  The intensity builds as each song builds on the one before it.  It's explosive and controlled intensity all at once.<br /><br />For those of us lucky enough to have witnessed THE DOORS live, during their early (and arguably) best period, this concert brings back a lot of memories of that initial excitement and wonder of what was going on onstage.  And just what was going on onstage?  For me as I think back to that era, when they came to my town, it was Morrison  rocking back and forth with the microphone stand-all barely controlled pent up feelings,  Manzarek was hunched over his keyboard-occasionally looking up at Morrison,  Densmore was cool looking-with his seemingly effortless drumming, and Krieger, standing in one spot, was full of concentration and intensity-getting just the right sound from his guitar.  The volume of Morrison and the band's sound swelling and then coming back down again-only to rise to another crescendo-it's all here.  This set from \\"The Bowl\\" will give fans a good idea of what this concert, and the band as a whole, was like.  And if you want only one album of THE DOORS live, this will fill the bill nicely.and as a whole, was like.  And if you want only one album of THE DOORS live, this will fill the bill nicely.
0099570297|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  I love the imagery and how the author has painstakingly created a beautiful circus with each tent being a world of it's own, but I don't care much for the love story that seems to be at the center of the novel.  It almost feels like the plot was an afterthought...the two central characters seem a bit shallow...I don't really know how else to put it.<br /><br />but the circus is so beautiful
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books are so well written and so hard to put down. I read the whole series in a few days and am now enjoying the audiobooks with my boyfriend. The movie was a giant disappointment, definitely read the books first. They are much deeper and say much more.

B007V65R54|3.0|From the reviews that I had come across it sounded like something that would be useful, informative and something that would help one separate the \\"noise\\" from the \\"signal\\" in real situations. Rather, it was more in the nature of chapter length anecdotes--examples. Although the book had some cursory discussion of Bayes' Theorem it was certainly not enough to do anything with it. Of course being able to separate the noise from the signal is important--but isn't that obvious?

B004EPYZUS|5.0|I have seen other Mission Impossible movies, but this one is my favorite. Whereas the other movies were slick, flashy, and very orchestrated, this one shows the mistakes during execution and how they were winging it by the seat of their pants. I thought it was different and made the movie much more enjoyable.<br /><br />I thought the storyline was amazing, very original. Part of the Kremlin gets blown up, the world is on the brink of war..sort of.., and a genius madman is at the center of the plot. A disavowed team of 4 with a limit of supplies and no support must save the world. It was a cool ride from the normality of my life, and I truly appreciated the story.<br /><br />All of the characters were great. I thought Tom Cruise was very funny, and I really liked Jeremy Renner workout scene before the floating over the fan scene, hilarious. Paula Patton was a fierce fighting femme fatale! I loved her passion in the fight scenes, and Simon Pegg was very funny, also. A great team of actors, and I'm glad I watched it.<br /><br />I do hope more Mission Impossible movies comes out, and I hope they show refreshing new ideas like they did in this one..<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Joy

0525952926|2.0|Having read Pillars of the Earth and the first of this Trilogy, I was disappointed.  This was primarily because of  the predictability of the plot... it was a letdown from the work of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" which seemed to have so much more \\"life\\" and zest to it.  This new book seemed to be too much of a formula--easy to read.  I guess I was looking forward to a little more \\"meat\\" in the book which is what I liked in the two previously mentioned works of Ken Follett.  I finished it in a short time but was expecting more. Perhaps we readers appreciate the earlier works of authors.  The same applies to John Grishams books- A time to Kill and Pelican Brief were page turners- his other books later on seemed to be effortlessly written and perhaps not enough thought and effort was put into the plot.  Almost like the words were on \\"auto pilot\\".  Anyway, to each his own...not sorry I read Folletts' book but the anticipation was more than the read.
1439192812|5.0|A beautifully illustrated book.  Dawkins addresses questions mankind has asked for ages, then provides the fables and religious beliefs we have used to address these questions...and then, of course, he provides the scientific answer in simple and understandable terms.  Not only the magic of reality is revealed but an appreciation for our human struggle for the truth and the beautiful and sometimes strange myths we have created to explain the world.
0380713802|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Bryson, so picking up any book by him is like getting a warm email from an old friend. I've also traveled extensively through Europe, much of which solo, so I had a deep appreciation for his experiences. I wonder if this was my first Bryson experience, or I had not traveled to the places he visited (or had traveled much at all) would I like this book as much as I did? Perhaps not. But for Bryson fans, and world travelers, take this on the plane during your next 7+hour journey. It may be two decades old, but, well, not much has changed, shall we say.

(ask Lori she thought she was Queen) even Carl's going to be badass as he grows up. I hope this series runs for ten years or longer it's every good as a series like 24 was, I just wish it were on HBO or SHOWTIME so there's no annoying commercials (18 minutes worth).
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I remember watching the oringal show while studying for college.  The daytime soap opera was serious and this particular version took a comedic turn.  I thought that it was tongue in cheek funny, Depp delivered some hilarious lines in a droll vampiric style, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00845PRDS|5.0|as a veteran, this movie is a great portrayal of military missions. this is not all \\"Hollywood\\" and they let these guys do their job.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This used to be a decent app. Until some recent updates, it was plain, simple and quick. Used to be able to open it right up, synch with my kindle and read. Now, instead of just synching, you have to wait for it to download your book (which I still have one queued and trying to download from months ago), then synch..takes forever. Have also had issues with books synching to the proper spot. Not sure why Amazon felt like it needed to be changed, but I wish they would fix it. It's virtually useless for reading on the go now. Bummer.
B004LWZW88|5.0|My grandson watched this movie so often I had to buy a repalcement!. Came on time and as advertised. Price was reasonable.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|An eye-opening clarification of Snow White's real story and the conflict with her morally corrupt stepmother, the wicked Queen. Here we see the true character of this sward-wielding princess with her insurmountable struggles against the magical powers of the evil monarch. The seven dwarfs are there, of course, but Dopey have morphed into a more serious version of himself. The prince in this adult version of the story changes too. He is now an Australian version of the conquering hero [sans the accent] with a greater roll in the film than just showing up at the end of the story to give our heroine a reviving smack on the lips. One new character shows up here, the wicked Queen's brother.... who, to no one's surprise, is the partner-in-crime of his bitchy sister. Fun film, new twists and turns, interesting special effects, descent acting and, as previously intimated, a cold water splash-in-the-face wake up for true history buffs.
B008NABUU8|1.0|I cant be the only one that is being forced to play this game upside down! It is constantly flipping so that i have to stand on my head to enjoy the game.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Sweeping tale of history, adventure, life and love with believable characters.  Enjoying it and cant wait for the book on disk.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|The original transformers were meant to be a two sided commodity, to be so one half would be a cartoon and the other an action figure line. The cartoon, to be successful would have to be accepted by kids and their parents. To please children it contained action, cars, and a variety of characters, some silly some serious. To please parents the shows would have a passing moral and a code of conduct. In the first animated Transformers movie that code changed and Optimus Prime died.<br />As I skimmed this movie I was treated to a world of unrealistic fantasy. There seemed to be some fun points, but overall this was a silly movie that crammed together pop icons, more story than was really useful, unbelievable relationships and situations (this is with suspension of disbelief at level 11) and a complete lack of any moral. In fact, when the final battle came to a conclusion it was the hero of the Autobots who took it into his own hands to brutally kill his two foes. The only good thing about this ending is that those foes would be necessary for a sequel. Optimus Prime and the entire cast of characters are all very much adult, all very much amoral when it comes to the enemies they face and the enemies the Autobots face are of course very amoral themselves.<br />So it comes down to a question of who cares. Who cares if the main human character has trouble finding a job, his girlfriend is smoking hot (but didn't she have black hair at some point?). Who cares if the Earth is threatened, we know it isn't going to be destroyed anyway. Who cares about the Autobots, they are friendly to humans, but they are just as violent as the Deceptocons when you get down to it. Who cares about the humans, they are a bumbling mess. Who cares about those two ity bity Autobots? Wait, I did, I actually thought their deaths (if they did die) were quite heroic.<br />So that is that, the stakes were low, my investment was low, and this movie, though a commercial success will surely go on the list ofrarely watched movies from the teens because it truly sucks.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I expected more from this novel than I received. This is an attempt at very relevant social commentary on small town and rural England. As such, I think it fails to give the non-British reader a good grounding in the background of rural politics before launching into the social commentary.<br /><br />I also found it hard to care about any of the characters. I was not left waiting for a sequel to see how their lives and loves progressed.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling has a proven, exceptional talent at world-building. I perceive that this book could have been improved by applying some of the techniques she used in her fantasy to entrap the reader in the political world of rural England.
B00899DR40|5.0|This album is pretty good I thought. But he does seem to sing about the same thing.. girls! and love!! Not a big deal though. I thougth it was good for the price.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater but want to see it again.  I think you can watch it many time and pick up things you missed before.  We also loved the bloopers.  They had us laughing out loud.  This is a must have movie.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This was an easy read-an ok love story, but it got a little long before they were obviously going to get together.  Seems better for a young audience-college characyers equals college readers.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This was a fun season to watch... New stories based on current world issues. Great show. Can't wait for the next season!!
B002CAWNEM|4.0|Alot of people didn't like this movie...I loved this movie. It was different. And not so much to make a scary movie, but definitely suspenseful. I could see watching it with your girlfriends for those \\"oh no she didn't\\" moments. It's a good movie. I don't really get the bad reviews, but hey, that's just me.
B00138J342|5.0|There are certain events that occur that when looked back upon can only be judged as landmarks in ones life! For me it was my first kiss in 7th grade...obtaining my degree...consuming more than my fair share of. 50 cent drinks at Binons Horseshoe! This collection of pearl jam pearls doesn't come close to matching those highlights- but it comes real close!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This ap gives a very helpful visable view of the life of your battery.  The shrinking bar is of some help but not nearly as complete or reliable.  I rely on this ap to take action before I run into trouble.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a very fun and challenging game.  and those of you who are giving it a bad review because of your sucky tablets need to stop. rate the game based on the game.
0307959856|1.0|My wife and I had high expectations for this book, and we read it aloud to each other. We actually finished it, although it was quite torturous and took a strong will. There are so many reasons that the book is unlikable that I find it hard to believe that anyone could say it has any redeeming qualities. For example:<br /><br />- The writing is horrendously boring. Long, wordy sentences that bear no resemblance to anything that Austen ever wrote, and that don't hold the attention of the modern reader. To verify this, we compared the opening few pages of P&P (fun, with clean, short sentences, and written to draw the reader into the story) with the opening few pages of this book (dry, wordy, and written to bore the reader to death).<br /><br />- Way too much \\"telling\\" instead of showing. There are entire chapters that contain no action. NOTHING HAPPENS in these chapters except James giving tediously long descriptions of people or past events.<br /><br />- Multiple retellings of the same events, sometimes by the same character who told it before, and it was laborious and boring the first time. (Really, the chaise driver is not an interesting character and his version of events on the night of the murder is only worth one pass.)<br /><br />- Little connection to Austen's characters. Yes, James uses their names, but they are mostly unrecognizable as the same characters.<br /><br />- If the core story (the murder) ever had any appeal, it succumbs early in the book to the ponderous weight of the writing and the snail's pace of what little action the book contains. And the revelation of who the murderer is is a complete cheat in the rules of mystery writing: a written confession from a bit character on his deathbed.<br /><br />Finally, James adds insult to injury in the epilogue by having Darcy explain his behavior in Pride & Prejudice! If Austen didn't think that his motivation needed explanation, who does James think she is to put such words into the character's mouth?? (And she even has Elizabeth do it a bit, too!)<br /><br />I haven't read any of James' other books, but don't waste your time or money on this one.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is fun but you run out of coins fast. You can buy more coins through Amazon but I won't do that. You get coins when off line or online though few and slowly. I just shut it down and come back later.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|With 6 Grammys under her belt, Taylor Swift, by all measure has made her mark.  Her last album, Speak Now, has been certified quadruple platinum.  Despite her unparalleled success at such a young age, Taylor Swift has not been standing still.  Red is her 4th studio album and has proven to be yet another masterpiece.  In many ways, this album chronicles her musical transition from catchy teen poop to a more mature sounding blend of rock and pop that at times echos the best qualities of bands like U2.<br /><br />The standard album is made up of 16 tracks that provides a nice blend of fast paced catchy pop songs like \\"Red\\" and \\"22\\" to to the slower paced, more melancholy numbers like \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\" and \\"The Last Time\\".  This album continues her unapologetic migration away from her country roots upon which she initially launched her career.  Most of her songs are decided pop, with only the slightest hint of country, with the exception of \\"Stay, Stay, Stay\\".  What has not changed though is her unswerving dedication to telling intensely personal stories through her songs. With lyrics like \\"Hey you called me up again just to break me like a promise.  So casually cruel in the name of being honest.  I'm a crumbled up piece of paper lying here, cause I remember it all too well\\", Taylor Swift stays true to what has made her so popular with so many.  In this album, every emotion is magnified, cranked up to 11 on a scale from 1 to 5.  Even casual moments like \\"I like hanging out with you\\" ultimately gets transformed into something about being together forever.  It feels like you are always standing on the edge of an emotional precipice, with Taylor right there with you, ready to take the plunge.  But that's exactly the kind of personal connection that Taylor fans crave most, and this album delivers it in an unrelenting flood.<br /><br />Though the flavor of this album is a bit more eclectic then what Swift fans have come to expect after the last 3 albums, it is still atits core genuinely Taylor Swift.  She is first and foremost a story teller whose canvas happens to be music.  And what a wonderful set of stories she has managed to paint in this latest installment.
B003D5A42S|4.0|I have an 11 year old daughter, and was worried that all the modern heavy bands were too old for her generation. About the most \\"edgy\\" music that kids have today is Dubstep, which, admittedly, I enjoy - but if you look at the most popular thrash, hardcore, or metal bands right now, they're all bands full of people my age. Where are the kids gonna turn for heavy music?<br /><br />I caught the video for The Final Episode, and had to find more from AA. Bought this album, was not disappointed.<br /><br />The kids are alright.<br /><br />The mix of clean, death, and screamo vocals on this album is outstanding. Danny has a hell of a lot of vocal range.<br /><br />Dynamically, the music on this album is tight. Bass, drums, and guitar blast out staccato rhythms that positively shred. I heard this band is considered \\"trance metal,\\" but the electronic use here is extremely subdued on most songs. When it's applied, it forms a kind of interesting break in the song, before the guitars ramp back up and blow you away.<br /><br />My only beef with this album is that some of the lyrics aren't very good. They range from the banal, to the childish, to the downright misogynist. I'm not a screaming hyper-feminist type, but there's really no excuse for a song that devolves into screaming about how a girl he's banging is a \\"stupid f***ing wh*re.\\" Seriously, that track, \\"Not The American Average,\\" is kinda ruined by the lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoy listening to this album for the music, and just avoid the couple of tracks that don't really do it for me. But I no longer worry that my kid's generation won't have anything heavy to listen to. The kids are still making heavy music. The kids are still being too loud.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|This is an intriguing story which will appeal to mystery and drama lovers alike. It is narrated by the older sister as if she were writing a letter to her sister who has disappeared. Twists and turns, well developed characters and a believable premise make this book a great find.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love this game!!! glad that there is finally an app. for it instead of just on facebook!! looking forward to future updates
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked this book much better than the first one Bare To You. I felt it was a better written book than the first. Bare To You was so a Fifty Shades rip off. Did not even compare to Fifty (which I LOVED) I was leary on reading this but it was much better. I can't wait till the next book comes out!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this is a very well written book.  If you can get past the dirty parts, the love story behind it is absolutely beautiful.  I find myself drunk in this book.  I can't wait to get to pick up my kindle again and read more.  I have read the first two books in about 2 weeks.  I'm waiting to buy the third because I don't want it to be over so soon!  Also, my husband hasn't really minded me reading it ;)
B0068THAGY|5.0|I loved this movie (and that's what 5 stars means). It was just a great look at a bunch of kids stuck in extraordinary circumstances. It reminded me of something along the lines of E.T. or The Goonies (although not quite as epic). There were flaws, but overall, I enjoyed this movie immensely.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the book.  I wonder how much of it actually happended the way it was written, but still was a very good read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I couldn't put it down. But, it did seem a little too repetitive with all the blushing and there were way too many adjectives! While i enjoy a brief description of things to set up a story line, it seemed to me that the author was trying to add more words than were necessary, like someone who was trying to write an essay that had a word count requirement. That being said, I will be reading on to see what becomes of these two.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Not being a child of that generation I really didn't know the political climate of the time.  It did seem a little strange to me that the only \\"good guys\\" seemed to be the socialists.  Is that the truth of the situation or the author's leanings?  The characters were strong but at times the book felt a little disjointed.
B004F1F32A|4.0|If you're going to watch this movie thinking it is some great drama with a fantastic plot, then you shouldn't watch it. If you like watching close combat fights, car chases and international criminals getting their fannies handed to them, then you will definitely be entertained.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|This was a book that kept me interested<br />Enjoyed the story line. This is the 2nd book in the Crossfire trilogy. Both books have been great.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent Game!!!!!  Hard to put down!!! Highly Recommend!!!  Can't wait for Sequel to come!!!  I would give it more stars than five.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|LOVED THIS!!!! I will be reading it again before the third one comes out which I cannot wait for!!! BUY THIS! Very well written!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the books i love the movie and i love the author, everyone needs to read the series :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was addicting I read through the trilogy in under 9 days.  It was really great although I hope there is a 4th book because I have some unfinished business with the characters.
B005HSL626|5.0|so cool get it I like all the modes so cool get it for free or bey it for 99&cent;
0061692042|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've ever read. Richard Ford is one of the best. Haunting.  The first several sentence are enough to hook you, then be prepared to not put it down until the end, and then maybe start all over again. very pithy.
0385344333|1.0|I am a big Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan and had this been the first Reacher novel I read, I would most likely never have read another one.<br />This book was a real page turner.  I kept turning the pages to no avail, the story lines and plot never got  any better.  Now I know how the Cathy Bates Character felt when she read the latest installment of Misery.  Mr. Child, if someone comes to you at a book signing and tell you they have read \\"A wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel and now are your greatest fan; you might want to call security.<br />Where is the Reacher I've grown to love?  Where is my big imposing 6'5\\", 250 lbs. gentle giant who meats out justice?  Where is the man that gets the girl in the end?  Mr. Child  turned him into a homeless man rather than a man who calls no place home.  It is bad enough that Mr. Child is ignoring the fans in favor of having Tom Cruise play Reacher, but now he has turned my hero into a hobo.<br />Save your money on this one.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased this case when I got the Kindle fire after it last Christmas. I can say that after almost a year of use, I still love this case. My Kindle goes with me everywhere in backpacks, purses, and tavel bags and I havent had a problem at all. Not only do I take it everywhere but my 2 yr old has stepped on & dropped my Kindle and it has come out without any marks or problems because of this case. I can say that one of the cons is that the felt on the inside cover does attract almost anything you can think of (hair, dust, etc.). I do not have any problems with the stand portion of the case and I have used the feature off and on this past year. I think the trick is to make sure that the case is bent properly. The outside rubber can be a bit stiff and doesn't stay in the groove very well when you first get it. After much use, the rubber outside looks great and it has kept together well. I wish that more electronics had something like this.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is a book that you will not want to put down!! Wonderful, sitting on the edge book! Feels like you are sitting beside Chris in the courtroom.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|The Disney movie Tangled is a fun flick. The animation is brightly colored and pretty to look at. The story is amusing. The music is okay; not bad to listen to but nothing that really stands out. This is just a pleasent family film.
0345803485|5.0|I didn't read it.  I bought this book for my wife.  She liked it so well, she bought the other two and read them also.  She couldn't put it down, except long enough to throw me on the bed and pounce on me.  It made her so horny, she was wearing me out.  It was good too.  I don't know how many times we made love while she was reading this book, but she had orgasm after orgasm.  Like when we first met.  She was masturbating in the shower too.  I don't know how many times we came, but we got a lot of miles out of this book.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it's fun but I'm super tired of all games making you use energy of some sort and when you run out you have to wait to continue playing. :(
B008J34466|5.0|Pink never disappoints! Here's another great group of songs! I love the attitude in her music! If you like Pink, you'll love this!
0316228532|1.0|Harry Potter fans need to stay away from this foul book! If you use the f- word regularly and look at porn you will have no problem with the book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i love this book. it leaves you on a huge cliff hanger, as he normaly does. i would recomend it to everyone.
B004F1F32A|4.0|This movie is a good family friendly suspense and drama thriller that maybe has too much violence for younger children but for teens and up is a good movie if a person likes action-type movies!  Well acted and suspensefull,  it will be enjoyed by most but probably appeal to males!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was the first novel that I‘ve read by him, although I did read  his Perfect Little Town short story which was equally good. I already purchased Run and am looking forward to reading that, as well. Everyone should give Blake Crouch a chance at one point or another!
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|10/22/12 I read the 5 stars and 1 stars. i would give this a 3 but you may have missed like me that it didn't come with a belt hook.<br />I read reviews and didn't look at additional pictures provided.  For some reason many reviews indicate people got the same thing with a belt hook.  it clearly shows (no statement however) belt hook is NOT provided with this one.  That loses a lot of appeal to me.  Fortnately my wife is talented and i think we can makeshift a belt hook and by the sounds of it better than OEM.<br />Other than that it fits but you have to twist it differently than you wear it so with it in your pocket don't expect to quickly answer a call using your Voyager Pro HD.<br />I carry wallet/keys in left front pocket and phone in other but with this it looks like i am going to have to move the wallet to back pocket until i add the belt hook since it does take up more room than expected.  Not complaining because my BT will last longer by protecting it with this case.  Good luck with your decision.  BTW Plantronics Voyager HD best BT I have owned.  I actually use it.  Big enough not to lose it.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game is so fun and has a lot of content if u unlock the death leavels. I've played HOURS of this game and still have'nt finished. Buy this game today!
B007TK77QE|3.0|This is difficult. On the one hand I assumed that her adult book would be as fantastically addictive as Harry Potter: on the other, she still writes well. However, the story deals with too many unlikeable characters so it was not easy to root for any of them.  They were all flawed in some way, and I kept hoping that one of them would somehow be redeemed!  Small town rivalries and teenage angst, unrequited love, and all of them undeserving of sympathy.  A tiny bit of Rowling humour crept in, and certainly not bad, but mostly it was a difficult book.  I hope she goes back to what she does best.  I do think that fans need to read this though.
B006GLQIVC|2.0|Ok, I am a little bit disappointed with this series.  Why is it that if Hayden is a ghost, then everyone can see her??????  What is the point of her being dead if she can still have sex, go to bars and be seen by her family as if she is alive.  This makes utterly no sense.  This whole series is going into a tailspin and I am not quite as fond of it as I have been.  Thumbs down and am glad this series is almost over.
078401213X|2.0|A grainy B&W film which I found confronting.  My teenage son wanted it, so I sourced it through Amazon.  He enjoyed the film quite a lot, but I found the storyline a little tedious.  Acting was very good.  A film that is 'a bit out there'!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I have read every Kathy Reichs/Temperance Brennan book and although I enjoyed this story, I missed the tension between Pete and Tempe and Ryan and Tempe. The story has great plot twists and turns in true Reichs fashion but it left me wanting just a little bit more. Otherwise it's a great read.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I got it to watch with the grand kids!I enjoy toy story ALL of them
B009KHDT0C|2.0|It could have been a really good movie but it was rather boring and didnt fit the time period they were going for it also could have left some stuff out

B008XG1X18|5.0|How can an online bulletin board improve your life? ...By allowing you to arrange all the brilliant ideas shared by creative people who love the things you love in one, uncluttered place.  No more magazine clippings on the kitchen table with coffee mug rings... no more pages stuck in binders and file folders that are never where you put them last... I have lost more good ideas than I have used.  Pinterest on my iPhone gives me instant access to the ideas I want to try so I can review the supplies I will need when I'm shopping. One pin has inspired a beautiful Garden door project, and the name for our new photo studio - Red Door Photography. I have utilized several pins in my garden, and have tried recipes in the kitchen. There will be more than one Pinterest-inspired gift under the Christmas tree this year. Pinterest has helped me take ideas I like into projects I can accomplish.
B001QWBTOM|5.0|True cinematography and acting that is passionate to the core.  Dramatic and appeasing to the eyes.  Touches my soul.  I hope the children of today appreciate movies like this instead of those special effect sex driven sci-fi driven movies.  I like those too but this movie brings me to a better place as a person. I think Amazon should have more christian movies like Fireproof or Courageous. Please
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game its a lot like dragonvale from the apple store and computer and really fun u can breed different dragons and feed them and you can use gold to speed up the process of breeding expanding your island for more room for habitats decorations etc you can also complete different quests to earn money and gold and exp you can also invite friends into your &quot;neighborhood&quot; by entering there STORM8ID all in all great fun game
B003VANOFY|3.0|Alright so I've had these for years now and can say that they are just mediocre. The interference that occurs when around any wifi signal sucks. Having the headset cutout while your trying to talk is outraging sometimes. It has pros, like the fact that its wireless and that its 7.1 is setup pretty well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August Pullman has a sweet, caring, happy family. It consists of his mother, who loves him very much, his father, who can make anyone laugh; his older sister, Via, and his dog, Darth Daisy. And then there's him.<br />Auggie was born with craniofacial anomalies, so he doesn't look normal. No, to &#34;normal&#34; people, we'd automatically think at the sight of him (without even wanting to), Hideous. Monstrous. Zombified. Scream II Scary. In this book, you learn that what lays under the facial appearance couldn't be farther from that.<br />I love Auggie. He's sweet, downright hilarious, and always makes the best of how he looks, even joking it about his face! (&#34;Hey, did you know the guy who made the Uglydolls based them on me?&#34;) Even though people are cruel to him, he merely shrugs it off, even though it's hard, and walks on. He's just...amazing.<br />Yeah, so I would go into all that ridiculous &#34;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll...&#34; stuff, but that's just not the kind of book that needs such a thing. It's absolutely phenomenal and I encourage all--like, EVERYONE everyone--to read it. REALLY read it.<br />And even before the end, I think you'll get why I kept asking Auggie, Why do you keep saying you're normal, Auggie? Please, you aren't normal.<br />You're a wonder. A real, true wonder.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book was good, very well written; I just think that it didn't have the best plot line ever. Even so, I would still recommend this book to my friends and family.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game! fun challenges and you don't have to pay money to be successful! give it a try! fun!
B009CO0B2C|4.0|While a little more mellow than recent efforts, she still has that voice - an instrument from the heavens.  After a few more listens I may even want to rate this a five star effort, but if you're even just a little bit into her, do not hesitate to get this.  I love Beth Orton.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Mike really shows America's true colors, and it's not Red, white and blue.<br /><br />He gives you a real history lesson on how this country is made and why you'll never see this in school textbooks.<br />Mike shows how and why American leaders want to keep american citizens stupid and uneducated, while the top 1% fat-cats continue their legal crime and remain wealthy and powerful.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|It can be hard to find a new, exciting book in a genre that is so saturated. I admit that I am an sci-fi/urban fantasy/paranormal junkie so it takes something special to get my notice. I found it in this book and I can't believe it took me this long that he is already so far into the series.<br /><br />Atticus is a pretty badass character and the interactions he has with his dog and neighbor are funny and sweet. What a balance. I think that is what did it for me. In some books the plot can get old or repetitive and leave you feeling like you have just wasted your time, but this book was so rich and entertaining I finished feeling very satisfied. I look forward to reading the next in the series and learning more about Atticus the Druid.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very well written.  I truly enjoyed the story, the characters, the mystery, and the author's writing style.  If you love a good underdog beats the odds story, you'll enjoy this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I also have computer version but I play this more afen but I wish it had red stone pistons and a nether but overall its a great game
1439102813|5.0|I read this book as a book club select, and it was wonderful. Many of us were a little scared to read it because at our mid-life ages, we were afraid we would see ourselves in the character. This led to deep and meaningful discussions about our personal experiences with people we had known that had Alzheimer's. The book is well-researched and well-written. We can't wait to read her next book for an upcoming book club meeting.
B0086449YA|3.0|I was a little bit disappointed with Marks latest  album. It does not come close to 'Get Lucky'. Probably did not need to be a double cd, could have put 13 or 14 tracks on one. Saying that the title song is vintage Knopfler at his best. I have tickets for his show in two weeks and am really looking forward to hear him perform some of these songs live.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is great! It keeps you playing and playing. The music is different but nice to listen to. This is probably one of the few games where I will actually play all the way through.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I FELT THAT THIS STORY WAS A LITTLE REPETITIVE. I AM NOT SURE I WILL CONTINUE READING THE TRILOGY.  I CAN SEE WHERE IT'S HEADING.  I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.  I REALLY LIKE MURDER MYSTERIES SO THAT POSSIBLE COULD BE GETTING IN THE WAY OF MY APPRECIATING THIS BOOK.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|If this isn't quite possibly the worse movie of the decade, it's a new low. Then again, I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be entertained. The actors themselves are accomplished, so I'm befuddled why any one of them would add this [insert word] to their established repertoire... Every one of them are buffed to the nines and yummy eye candy. Could be fun watching after a few bottoms' up's (no pun intended) or for bachelorette, dorm parties, etc. Matthew Matthew Matthew... so much talent...
B007T99ENE|4.0|Ian McEwan's craft has always been alluring story-telling with plot twists so beguilingly sharp they take your breath away.  All this is so engrossingly on display in Sweet Tooth that it sustains even the fancy post-modernist overlay of \\"story-teller telling a story about story-telling within a story about story-telling\\".
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I was waiting for this to come out and it did not fail me. It is amazing and fantastic. Mumford and sons is the best band ever
B0091REZMW|5.0|very nice game makes u think only thing is that your energy wastes fast but other than that good game
B00932IQIO|5.0|Very entertaining series!<br /><br />I enjoyed the simple way to view this Amazon product.<br /><br />Amazon is a super and simple way to watch from my PC. No longer having to wait for excessive download times.
1417709049|3.0|Due to many reviews about the book being \\"scary\\" and \\"innovative\\", I decided to pick up House of Leaves.<br /><br />The book is certainly entertaining in some points.  The clever way some of the pages are laid out was fun and conveyed what the author was trying to do.<br /><br />However, ultimately, I found the book not \\"scary\\" at all, and found some of the story lines mind numbingly dull.<br /><br />The book does hit on some great themes and symbolism, but drags on for a bit too long. By the end of the book, I felt all those little tricks the author was using were irritating.  (I know that is part of the point, and it succeeded, but that doesn't mean I like being irritated, on purpose or otherwise).<br /><br />Is it worth a read?  Absolutely, but I would not pick it up expecting this to be the be all end all of horror stories.
B001TK8TJO|1.0|This book is written in terms of someone who is in Kindergarten~<br /><br /> Very bland, insipid, and of absolutely no use whatsoever~<br /><br /> This was a complete waste of paper and ink, in my opinion~<br /><br /> Completely out of touch of any semblance of intelligence, to gain insight to any level of relationships~
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|As a lifelong Captain America Fan, I loved this movie start to stop. Full of action, and full of fun. This movie carries it all, except, I wish they would lay off the romance crap, and just keep it as an action/adventure. Outside of that, this movie is well worth the price..
B008NABUU8|5.0|Great game for kids. Really helped my young daughter learn her addition tables and she loved the cute dinosaurs on the second level. Great FAOTD
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I enjoy the convenience of having the calculator plus on my kindle. large enough for easy visual.  perfect for calculating tips,  and accessibility for homework.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|It's a beautiful game on my Kindle Fire...but when downloaded for my razr M won't run.  Haven't had any help getting that resolved.
B001PPGAJE|5.0|Mystique and Magneto are my favorites. This is a must have movie, but then again every x-men movie is a must have movie.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This story captures your interest from the get go! It starts with an unexpected death and dives right into the lives & people surrounding this death in a little village in England. I can't put it down!!!
B001GCUO16|5.0|Awesome movie but i wish it had Magneto and Mystique in it they are my two personal favorites. I like Pyro too. Team Villains!!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|After absolutely loving Bared To You, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one.  I really enjoyed finding out more about Gideon and Eva, although I have to say there are a few similarities in the storyline with 50 Shades of Grey.  I will of course read the next instalment and look forward to doing so, but I hope it's not a predictable ending.
1455519006|5.0|I listened to this in audio version and it was amazing. I could not stop listening and although it took 3 nights to get to the end, I found myself going to bed early so I could listen. My reviews are never negative because I do not feel qualified to judge an author who puts so much energy and time into what he/she does. I like the books written by Mr. Baldacci and have many but this one is my favorite and I think it will remain so. I recommend this to readers who can appreciate an excellent story. I believe I will listen to it over many times. It is really good.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its fun but the draw back is that the Max number of coins you can get back while not playing is 47 but otherr than that its aloty of fun
B0078X2LKY|5.0|kids love this book, and so do i. kids of all ages love this book. the kids i watch ask for this book a lot.
B000VWPX3G|5.0|Wow where to start. mean production, crazy lyrics.Cant put it in words very good piece of work.Favorite song shadow boxing.Cant get enough of that song.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This version of Mah Jong is a very addicting one!  It is very hard to get 3 stars on all of the games, so it makes you try and try again.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|This is an amazing book. it is gripping from start to finish. i found myself sneaking off by myself to read. could not put it down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its alright.. gives me something to do when I'm bored. some games are really addicting..,.........jhgvyjjn hmnhv hymnbook tyydh dhx jxjc fjd bd
030771652X|3.0|I was very disappointed with the last 50 pages of the book and the direction of the plot.  A lovely story of a sister's struggle for knowledge took a strange Sci Fi twist.  I wanted to love this book when I started but struggled to finish it.  The author has a lovely tone in her writing though and makes great connections between the characters.
0316113506|5.0|Another great book by Dr. Ratey!  Enjoyed this one as much as \\"User's Guide to the Brain.\\"  Captivated and kept my attention.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie is great....enjoyed watching it again.  Can't wait for the sequel(s).<br /><br />Streaming it though (via Amazon) is another issue.  I can't say who the problem lies with and/or who to blame but streaming HD content via my High speed (broadband through my Cable company internet provider) connection was not all that good.  The movie hung up numerous times through the movie and that is quite a bother.  Again, I don't know if it is my cable companies fault (Comcast cable - paying for 20 Mbps download speed) or if it is due to issues at Amazon.<br /><br />Not sure I'll be streaming HD content anytime soon.
034544678X|5.0|It was great to get a gently used copy of the book \\" At the Other End Of The Leash,\\" And for the money to go the Good Will of the area who had the book. I'm using Dr. Patricia McConnell's information to train my newly adopted Vizsla dog.Once again a positive experience with Amazon.com. Thank you, Shirley Brown
B00908DDZM|4.0|Ryan Lewis is a flawless producer. It's then up to Macklemore to not mess it up. He sometimes gets a little preachy and delivers his rhymes like Brother Ali, who I'm not a big fan of. I feel like Macklemore is at his best when moving fast, and just flowing with the beat (see \\"Thrift Shop\\"). I appreciate and respect that he isn't afraid of any subject matter, and writes some very focused and thoughtful lyrics on songs like \\"Same Love\\" and \\"Wings\\". It's then frustrating that they put Schoolboy Q on the song \\"White Walls\\", spitting the generic \\"hoes\\" and \\"coke\\" crap.<br />Bottom line: They do go for home runs, and hit quite a few of them. Their best songs are elite, their misses are probably still better than a lot of modern rap.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I loved this book! Rick riordan knows how to leave you in suspense. I'm waiting with baited breathe for the House of Hades.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is do addicting that it is actually fun to play when waiting on someone or getting home. Once you start you start you will find it difficult to stop playing.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I waited up until midnight to download the album, and I was telling myself as I waited that it better be worth it! However I'd forgotten that it's Taylor so it has to be good!<br /><br />At first listen, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, but by the second trip through, I was catching on to the lyrics and the songs were really growing on me. It's more deep than the first three albums, it took me a little longer to decide I liked it, but the \\"like\\" for the songs has more substance! :) Definitely give it a try, or three. It may take a little longer to catch, but by the time I was ready to fall asleep I had \\"Begin Again\\" on repeat.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Hmm curiosity did get the better of me.<br />I resisted for a long long time.<br />Wish it hadn't won.<br />I am the cat.<br />Curiosity killed me.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was a wonderful book full of fascinating characters and history.  Had my bookclub read it and everyone loved it.  Starting the 2nd in the trilogy now.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|The book is too long and the plot is too complex.  I think Riordan could have written 3 books instead, he put everything into one confusing long and tiring quest.  I really enjoyed the first 2.This is a review of the Mark of Athena by Rick Riordan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Loved what he did for her.  Can't wait for the third one. Great author.
B0064W65UM|3.0|I thought it was a good read and certainly a classic. but personally i liked the movie better. i didnt find myself caring about the characters as much as i did for the film but it was still very well written, illustrated, and delivered
B005ZOLW4Y|2.0|Just walk away from it unless you can get an original vinyl or a decent CD. The mastering is horrible on this version. I have the original vinyl, but it's really seen better days so I thought I'd get a \\"cleaner\\" version.Wow, was that a mistake! The original vinyl, scratches and all, is far superior to this copy of a copy of a copy. The songs have been transferred either too fast or too slow. At first I thought it was my hearing, but when I compared the original to the new one I could definitely hear the difference. Very disappointed in this purchase.
0151003084|5.0|funny and a great read - adults will probably find it more funny than children. illustrations are nice and rhymes are simple.
B000VWGYEI|5.0|I have the original vinyl version, not a CD or mpg version. There is a world of difference without the compression. I love the vinyl, but if you can't find it, get one of the other versions. Either way, it's a great album from a time when Elton's voice was still beautiful and pure.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Recently watched this on a flight to Florida. Enjoyed it immensely. I do believe that souls are here with us for awhile after death either to finish an unmet need or to comfort their love ones. When this is done they move on. If you liked Ghost Whisper then you will like this.
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|Hi,<br /><br /> It's a beautiful movie yet, as with most movies to movie form, it's a very trimmed version of the book which contains a massive amount of information.  Most of which is accurate...aside from the Christian view...which usually lacks correct information.<br /><br /> The movie uses paintings as a way to show how our thoughts create our world....which is very different than the book.  The directory did convert it nicely to film.  However, and I really like that both endings are included.  Well made movies, like this, usually inspire people to go to the book to get more info.  I didn't really feel that with the movie.  My life's experiences have very much been about what the movie is about, so I already Know things the movie was talking about well before ever seeing it, and I remember Past Lives but I focus on Now.  It's not a Believe System for me..it IS Knowing.  I remember also, before being Born. Not many do, and that's something that IS touched on in this movie.  Step away from the Churchianity Belief System (which I was never indoctrinated into) and you'll See the many Truths this movie speaks of.  Note, please, that I'm not typing about Christianity as the 2 are very, very different.<br /><br /> There is No Death, only Life...on many levels/dimensions and there is NOT just 1 Life.  That is a very popular misinformation and in NO religion has that ever been Taught.  This movie makes very clear what Heaven and Hell are...Emotional!  Not actual PLACES Unless Your \\"Belief System\\" is that a Hell exists, then you'll Create it for Yourself.  It's awesome to know, You're in control...either way.  I Love Life, and the Leading Edge Adventure that it is.  It's a Wonderful gateway movie to the Book.  Please read it, but without Brainwashed Church views.  Then you'll get the Truth that's being shared.<br /><br /> If you want to REALLY know More... Check into The Law of Attraction.  Abraham-Hicks.  Also get the movie, The Celestine Prophecy. It speaks of the Power we Have within Us.<br /><br />Inner Peace and Silly Enlightenment is what Everything is About.  Create Well-Being.
0399159029|5.0|The most attractive feature of any Philip Kerr novel, especially the Bernie Gunther series, is its ability to create a sense of clear and present danger that accompanies a mystery that begs to be solved. All those who are anywhere near the action in his novels should rightfully fear for his or her life. Anyone who is bold enough to shrug off that fear and face the challenge of getting at the truth, regardless of its inconvenience, will be rewarded with knowing that evil is conquerable and that justice can prevail even if it is beset by human failure. The setting for this particular gem is wartime Berlin and Prague and the main players are a pack of wolfish SS types who are bent on destroying both the Czech culture and the Jewish people. Offsetting this gallery of rogues is an equally determined and vicious Czech underground prepared to do anything to defeat the evil purposes of their Nazi foes. The hostility between these two camps is very strongly felt in this strange tale of Kafkaesque intrigue and horror involving a string of murders that follows a trail directly to SS headquartes in Prague. In the midst of this war zone are two figures contending for what is left of the moral high ground: a prominent German SS general, named Heydrich, who as proector of Bohemia, wants to find out who killed one of his trusted adjutants and a very professionally dedicated gumshoe named Gunther who has been called in to lead the investigation. As Gunther's investigation unfolds, involving various interconnected incidents, the reader discovers another story emerging. The evil Heydrich has created this little sideshow by murdering his adjutant and getting a very competent detective to conduct a lengthy probe while he deals with the bigger problem: a group of Czech terrorists, through a London connection, has infiltrated his Prague operations and pose a threat to his life. While Gunther confidently goes about exposing Heydrich and his henchmen for the rotters they are, Heydrich is desperately trying to find the informants before the movement assassinates him. Gunther is one of those good Germans who knows how to get at the heart of the matter without compromising his ethics. He hates Nazis, liars, and hypocrites but hanging out with them may be necessary if mysteries are to be solved. Don't assume that truth is automatically transparent anywhere in this bizarre story with its many twists and turns. Check out the website on the post-war execution of one of Heydrich's nasty minions. The Czech people definitely get the last word on this terrible chapter in their history.sperately trying to find the informants before the movement assassinates him.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book keeps you in suspense with every word. I read the whole book in less then a day, I just couldn't put it down!!! This book takes in expected turns that just make you gasp in disbelief. I am however glad to say that it gives you closure and even gives you a small peek into the future. And for those in love with Chritian Greys character as I am, this book gives you more details into his past and his 50 shades. Enjoy!!!  You must read fifty shades of grey and fifty shades darker first!!!!
0321344758|5.0|Book is used as the text book for a college course. Writer keeps everything short and sweet and the text is not chock full of technical jargon. Great read for web designers.
B000SEI230|5.0|The story was so inspiring. I would recommend it to my friends. This is the kind of love that anyone will wish for.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Twists and turns for a very spell binding and captive story, glad there is still some reads with good if not completely happy endings.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The final chapter in a World changing book series. The books were very good reading, easy and fast.<br />The audio books were also great to go through, Jim Dale is exceptional!<br />Now I finally have full sets of all media....yes I'm a hooked \\"Potter\\" fan.<br />One might think a 60 year old man would have better things to do, but it's amazing what I get done while playing one in the background.
B00684J49U|4.0|This has got to be one of my favorite seasons for this series. More interesting characters, sexy doctors and cool plots.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I upgraded from an AMD 965 Black quad core. This six core smokes it with X264 encoding. And matches it on a per core basis. I pretty much new this when purchasing.  But I do a lot of video editing, and things that call for more cores :p  These chips are very difficult to get now.  If you can, you won't regret it.  I suspect the next AMD FX release will be the best bang for buck though. Time will tell ;)
B005LAJ212|5.0|This Show is great! I can't wait for the next Complete season DVD. As this is US region and I am in Europe region I had to see it on my pc... but it was worth it!<br />Please let me know when season two comes out!<br />Great actors, Great writing! Awesome!!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|Was a little hesitant in the beginning. Got to really know the characters, and the story line got really going in the second book. Very enjoyable!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Wonderful sequel to Fall of Giants.  The interwoven stories keep the reader hooked right until they all come together beautifully at the end.  Follett keeps the reader interested from first to last page - a master storyteller.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|Great songs and perfectly arranged in the dj mix of the album love it. Im sad to see that they are going on a hiatus hopefully they will come back soon
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've only just begun my fitness and nutrition journey, the day after finishing Bigger Leaner Stronger. I cannot relay long term results, but it did inspire me to start and so far today hasn't killed me.  I am over 30 and not thin already.  Getting through workout 1 and eating right wasn't as hard as I would have thought.  Hell I quit smoking today as well (26 years of smoking), because why not.<br /><br />I've had some beginning education in Nutrition and Exercise and how the body uses food for fuel etc. so a lot of what Mike says isn't new information.  However, he puts the nutrition together with the training and includes his experience weeding out the B.S. from the good intel on both.  In my case I've tried fad stuff, I've tried training the wrong way, I figure trying Mike's advice can't make me more out of shape.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone trying to get in shape of hone the shape they're already in.  Honestly if you care about what you put in your body and cannot answer the \\"What is a calorie?\\" question it's a good book for you too.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Charlize Theron was excellent in this movie and the special effects rocked. Kristen Stewart was slightly better than her normal brooding self as well. Liked the spin on the classic fairy tale. Should have been more of a romance with Thor but then it would have been a chick flick and not the fantasy/action film it was.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|The best film rendition of Pride and Prejudice I have ever seen. I will always adore this movie, and having it in all formats is just fantastic. I can watch it literally anywhere now and the Bluray version is so beautiful. I had to take it to a friends to even see that one, and we both sat enthralled just watching wonderful landscapes and costuming. A must see for everyone !
B008NABUU8|3.0|The app looks great, but the 3D water doesn't add to the game play and probably slows down everything else. Also great attention was given to the background and environment, while the wooden building materials look plain. Could be improved.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|So I started this trilogy after much consideration wanting to see what all the hype was about and half way through the first I thought this sucks, it is horrible where is all this supposed awesome sex scenes everyone kept raving about? I thought it was boring and didnt want to continue but I did cause I thought hey Ive started already maybe it will get better and I just needed to finish all three and I was so wrong on all accounts. Why is it our society thinks it is okay for a young girl to get into an abusive and controlling relationship? If you are into s and m that is all well and good or whatever, but that was not the point here it went beyond that. I just didnt get all the hype and why everyone talked about how great the love scenes were and that they were so hot, Ive read regular romance novels that had hotter love scenes in them because you become emotionally involved with the characters and in this book I could not. It was boring, Ana got on my damn nerves, I wanted to laugh and Christian and whack him in the nuts and tell him to go to hell and leave him in the street, what a jack hole. The whole part of a good book is that you want to relate and be a part of the fantasy it, this book had nothing of the sort. So when I hear people go on and on about how great this book is I just want to roll my eyes, oh yes I did say it, lol. It is just wrong on so many levels and I hope that any female reading this book can keep in their head that this is a book and it is not okay for a man to control you and be violent in any way shape or form no matter how hot he is or rich.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This app is really fun to play!<br />Probably a few hours of enjoyment<br />The only thing is I payed 2 or 3 dollars but now they decided to make it free<br />Review number 1
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This third volume of the Song of Ice and Fire is like a Thanksgiving dinner with just too much of everything, at the end of which discomfort overtakes the culinary pleasures.  The first two books were replete with interesting and contrasting characters whose lives intrigued and involved the reader. A real feast of delight. Many favorites are now gone or at the margins and in their place we have more and, to me, less interesting players.  I still kept eating, but I am not looking forward to the next meal with as much anticipation.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|I have read all four books twice through now and have seen the first three movies twice each. I recently bought Breaking Dawn and watched it the same day.  It was a good continuation of the other three movies with one problem.  It left me wanting to see the final movie now LOL.  I will probably go with my daughter to see it when it comes out at the theater and then wait for the movie to come out on Amazon so I can download it to my computer.  Sometime in the future I will buy the last two on disc to keep with my other hard copies.  It is worth seeing.
B0086449YA|5.0|I am always anxiously awaiting a new Mark Knopfler CD and when I saw that this was a double CD I was very excited to get it.  He is one of the few artists whose CD I would buy without hearing it because he never disappoints me.  His unique artistry is evident here.  From the subjects of his songs to the way they are presented Knopfler is at the top of his game.  A must-have for Knopfler fans.
B004GJ1XU2|3.0|I am sure this was a big movie in 1983.  I enjoyed the movie but you could tell the age.
B001NB4Z6K|5.0|Has all of my favorite U2 songs, which is all I was truly looking for, a good purchase for the price.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Great special effects wrapped around a plot from the early '50s. We ignored the dumb plot in Alien because it was less sci-fi and more of a slasher movie. Prometheus is not so lucky; the dumb plot sticks out like a sore thumb. 3D effects are great; elevating my rating to a 2. However, Prometheus may be a 4 or 5 for audiences who don't read sci-fi or who don't know what NASA's Curiosity is. There's not much science in this sci-fi movie.
0553801473|4.0|Good enough book, but I am with other reviewers, it is kind of like spinning your wheels. I know Martin is filling in the blanks and the time line, but not much is happening! Of course there is another book in the works...
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I switch between reading on my Kindle Fire, my Xoom tablet, and my Android phone. I love being able to retrieve my bookmarks on any of the devices. After reading this rather long and involved series with the Kindle I don't think I can go back to paper or hardback copies.<br /><br />The storytelling is amazing. The books are immersive. The characters are well thought out and I find myself alternately rooting-for, and loathing them. Very well written books<br /><br />Cons on Kindle version:<br />I wish the maps worked better on the Kindle because they are hard to read. When I enlarge it is not clearly legible.<br />The bookmark page numbering system doesn't work ( the Kindle shows that I'm still on page 695 even though I am reading the last book and it's been this way since the first book...what?) all that well.<br />Also, using the slider to find a spot in the book is not a smooth thing to do. The slider jumps all over the place.<br />Saving a bookmark in my phone easily allows me to pick up my location on the Kindle, but not vice versa.
0374214913|5.0|The biggest problem I have with this book - it ended.  As a former librarian and high school math teacher, I loved this book.  It is sort of a cozy mystery, there is no blood and guts, thank goodness.  But, it's more than that.  It has wonderful old books and brand-new technology all in one.  I really hope there are more of this sort to come.  It has a chase through time but takes place in the modern world.  It perfectly defines immortality in the best way possible.  It pulls you along from page to page.  I just loved it.  Don't miss this book.  My biggest problem is what am I going to read now.  This is a completely different idea than I have seen in a book, so now what?  Mr. Sloan, please work on another of this sort.  I was so worried that the ending would fall apart and it didn't.  It ended just the way it should.  And I loved the afterward at the end.  It tied everything up beautifully.  Don't miss this book!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was always a fan of Tina, but this book made me laugh more than i have ever laughed at a book. Commical, touching, and much more than i had hoped for going into this book. Great job Tina, hope to read another whenever that may be!
B008NABUU8|1.0|don't like bring pestered for a review after every level... So here's your negative review. With enough words to make it valid.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The main character is laughably nieve and all the sex is boring!!!!<br />Where's the story?? I can't believe that someone as damaged as Christian Grey could  find someone as stupid as Ana  attractive? REALLY?? The author must be as gullible as Ana if she expects us to swallow this premise.(Please forgive my spelling.)
B008CJ0JTI|4.0|An earlier work by David Fincher, beautifully shot, well acted, it's dark and a little funny, suspenseful and just a good flick. Worth the watch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A wonderful continuation of the series. Read twice and it was even better the second time. Gideon is one of my favorite romance novel men.  Suspenseful and delicious from beginning to end.  I cannot recommend this series enough!  Looking forward to Entwined into You!!

B007Q35PLI|4.0|Very informative. There are so many children & adults with one of several types of autism & associated \\"disorders\\"..... It is such a complex disorder that I'm reluctant in calling it so! In its' extreme levels, the person can be totally \\"dis-associated\\" with others, including parents & siblings. But having a grandson with some form of the disorder, I have had 1st hand experience with what a person can do if they have the \\"love & consistency\\" of a dedicated & loving care giver. We all remember how cruel children are with \\"normal\\" kids. Try tacking on the difficulty to communicate fully!<br />The movie & the \\"lady\\", Temple Grandin has shown that people can persevere & overcome & in her case, \\"excel\\" in life! She shows us that we wouldn't have the Einsteins'; Nikola Teslas'; & others' if it wasn't for this \\"so-called\\" disorder!<br />If you have or know someone with autism, you will be \\"up-lifted\\" watching this movie!

B004T5K3OK|3.0|Got this app over a year ago and used. it quite often to scan doc on the go.  Came in very useful.<br />Would give it 5 stars if it worked with ICS.  Ever since my Sensation 4G got an ICS, the app crashes on conversion, both from image and from camera.  tried different ICS Roms, all same.<br />Reinstall, clear cash, fix permission, nothing helps.<br />Please update this for latest Android versions!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Good cinematography, I really like the way the film was shot. You still get the classic feel of an older Sherlock Holmes movie, but with more clarity, and detail. They even throw in a Matrix type move here and there. Smart people everywhere, beware of Holmes' brilliance it is sure to captive and entertain.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OUTSTANDING!! best books I have read in a long time!! I actually read them all twice and they were just as good the second time around!!

B005LLSNNE|5.0|Watching TV is a family passion and a great way to spend quality time together.  Since we don't have cable-we use Roku and now Amazon Prime.  We go from one series to the next.  SOA is awesome.  Our favorite characters are Jax, Chibbs, and Gema.  Season 4 is intense and Season 5 is even hotter.  Series gets better and better.  The writing is awesome!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book was a most enjoyable and entertaining read.  A insightful and thought-providing story that provides food for thought about our life's journal and being open to new paths outside our routine.
B0012EJVTY|2.0|Purchased this release a few years ago, after ignoring the info I'm about to impart to you.<br /><br />Warner/Rhino have the stereo imaging backwards. I've listened to the mp3 version Amazon offers here and it's also incorrect. If you've ever seen DP live you know Blackmore was always stage left (audience/stereo  right) and Jon Lord was hard panned  left. This disc has it reversed, so if it matters to you this will be unlistenable. You'll be flip-flopping your R/L cd cables for one disc.  If it doesn't matter to ya' then ROCK ON !!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, and it has inspired me to write biographies for myself. Growing up in my generation this book is extremely fun to relate to, and it's incredible to hear the action behind the scenes of technology that has helped form the life that we've all grown accustomed to. I love it and recommend it for any and all inquisitive readers!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Im Ready for the next book. i hope everything turns out the way it should. keeping my fingers crossed. yes.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The book was great. very similar to 50 shades of grey however had a different twist that i enjoyed. very easy read
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Application works fine.  Since small screen doesn't allow for<br />all views you have to up and down and side to side to get a<br />full picture. Otherwise good.
1451627297|5.0|Read this book -- it will transport you back in time! This book presents a tantalizing premise -- what if the outcome of 11/23/63 could be changed???!!!<br /><br />For those of us who remember that dark day in 1963, this book is a very entertaining and engrossing read.  Most people remember what they were doing when they heard the news of the assassination.  Then we were transfixed to the TV for the next few days; the swearing in of LBJ, the shooting of Oswald, the endless mourners viewing the casket in the Rotunda, the procession the day of the funeral, John-John's famous salute.<br /><br />It was a delight to read this book and travel back in time to the years 1958-1963,  I was but a youngster then and many of the products/food/cars/people that Stephen King mentioned in this book brought a smile of recollection to me.  As an adult, I lived in Dallas for three years and have seen the infamous Texas School Book Depository; it's a creepy, eerie feeling seeing the place where the assassination happened.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the parts of the book that portrayed Lee Harvey Oswald's private life, his conversations with his wife, his comings and goings, his failure at just about everything he touched.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love Homeland. I only have a regular antenna so I can't watch it on the cable channel. I do need to know why I can't download it since I have purchased it. Please let me know why I can't download it to a DVD for my personal use.  This will make a difference if I purchase more in the future or if I just go buy the DVD at a store. Thank you.<br /><br />Linda Callicott

B00910Y1OQ|2.0|game was fun but there was no conclusion. there was a plot up until you beat the game then it just ends. there was no ending which made me wish I hadn't played through. the game doesn't prepare you for some of the challenges either.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I have only just preordered my copy , but if what the first reviewer said was true and it is a limited release of only some of the songs , it is not the best news.<br />However , for those of us that shared the concert experience of a lifetime , it is the best we have at our grasp for the time being.<br />I am sure there will be a full concert DVD and Audio CD somewhere down the track.<br />As it is I have grabbed as many Youtube clips as possible from the tour but the quality isn't that great.<br /><br />If you are a fan , if you went to the concerts , this disc give you the chance to relive the moment again and again. We should be thankful that this is being published.
B009KUANWG|3.0|Unfortunately this is a bit repetitive and the production/mastering leaves a bit to be desired.  I would love to hear a more carefully mastered Adele song (maybe a whole album) - take it easy on the signal compression please!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book fits perfectly into the Heroes of Olympus Series and is a great addition to the entire Percy Jackson collection.  Love that RR didn't just stop with the original series, as there seems to be infinite themes to explore and a wealth of adventures to be had.  I wish JKR would do the same thing for the Harry Potter Series

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love Loved this book cannot wait for the third book to come out but until them I will re-read fifty series lol !
B009329ZF2|2.0|Let me be brief.  The movie plot, script,and acting were less than mediocre.  The plot improved slightly when the action started a third of the way in.  However, worse than all of this is Amazon's unreliable video streaming.  It's never very enjoyable to watch a movie with 25-30 interruptions lasting from 20 to 60 seconds each.
0375703764|4.0|There are things about this book I absolutely loved.  First of all, the pure terror after putting down the book, turning off the light and hearing the house around me settle.  The sensation took me right back to the first Stephen King book I ever read (The Stand) and the uncut horror it poured into me.  Danielewski is so patient with the suspense and demonstrates a remarkable confidence in the ways he subverts and transgresses the genre.  That's the second thing I love.  Mr. Danielewski must have grown up in an open barn, because he HATES the fourth wall.  With his bevy of narrators, the reader is forced to flip back and forth between pages, look ahead in the oddly empty appendices, turn the book upside down, and even put it up against a mirror to read an exhaustive list of proper nouns.  All of these narrative breaks would be the kiss of death to any conventional novel.  But reading this novel at night, alone, being forced in and out of reader mode and into investigator mode heightens your sense of awareness.  The things around you start sticking out in your mind, your ears begin noticing sounds that you can't help but imagine are sinister.  The book is powerfully crafted to warp your immediate perceptions and plunge you into your own personal House (or apartment, or dorm) of Leaves.<br /><br />The things I loved the best were often marred by the stuff I couldn't stand.  The meta-narrative by the meta-editor Truant is meta-long.  It just keep going and going and going.  If Danielewski was trying to make his own narrator detract from the narrative flow and thus break again the fourth wall, masterfully done.  I couldn't stand it after a while.  I felt like the most effective portions of the book were the prime narrator's monograph on a non-existent documentary film.  It contains stunning passages that get increasingly shunted aside for more of Truant's drug-addled Angelino navel-gazing.  Or navel-piercing, since he is a tattoo artist.  But even so, Truant's story at times adds to the creepy house-within-houses feel of the book, another layer of separation between us and something that never existed or cannot be proved to have existed.times adds to the creepy house-within-houses feel of the book, another layer of separation between us and something that never existed or cannot be proved to have existed.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling is terrific in her debut adult novel.  A little like an English Peyton Place with more sophistication.  Her characters come alive and are real when we consider the dark part of our own hearts.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I selected this book from the Kindle Daily Deals for $1.99 and was not disappointed.  Even though I am not normally a sci-fi reader, I found it very entertaining with an intriguing plot.  I would highly recommend to other readers.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I figured this would be a good movie, minus the hulk since all the hulk movies were not impressive at all. But i was shocked that the actor and computer animation was almost flawless when compared to the other hulk movies . The movie itself was as great as all the other marvel movies, maybe a bit better. Defendantly worth the watch even if you don't  like the cartoons or comics etc. Very good movie for kids and adults alike.
0525952926|4.0|Follett has to be one of the great writers of our time.  He crosses geography and history with epic tales that give the reader a clear insight into life, in this book, from the 1930's.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good book. I am anxious to finish the last book in the trilogy. Why did I not read these sooner? Can't wait!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Yawn!! I knew the book was going to be very different from the Harry Potter series. JK Rowlings writing  style has flowed in the past. Unfortunately in The Casual Vacancy too many characters, too many nicknames. Plot line drags on!! Don't think I will finish reading the book - which rarely has happened.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I read the first book back in August and loved it!  I couldn't wait for the second book to come out.  I had so much anticipation for this book I'm not sure if that's what lead to my disappointment.

B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I liked this movie. It has good character development, doesn't rely on special effects and was generally entertaining and thoughtful.
B0098VXE50|2.0|I looked forward to seeing this movie for months, however I was disappointed in the end.  For the most part, this was an excellent movie, the cinematography was fantastic, the story was great, the supporting actors were fabulous (Charlize Theron as the Queen was just perfect).<br /><br />However the leading role was very poorly played.  The actress showed virtually no emotive skills.  I just could not sympathize or identify with Snow White, because the role was played so incredibly poorly.<br /><br />It's a shame.  This could have been a great movie.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I  am not married but l am a minister.  l heard a lot of good reviews for this book and I finally got a chance to read it.
B000ASAEQW|5.0|I cannot count the number of Die Zauberlfote recordings that I own.  Almost every time a new production comes out, I grabbed it.<br />The earliest version that I have listened to is Ferenc Fricsay's. Great names abound there - Streich, Stader, Haelfiger, Fischer-Dieskau (as Papageno!)...Streich's Queen of Night is particularly memorable, in mono sound.  I also love the Boehm version's Tamino greatly - Fritz Wunderlich, though not equally matched by the rest of the cast, still ranks as the unsurpassed Tamino. Modern Zauberflote on CD includes Abbado's Roeschmann/Strehl/Miklosa.<br />On DVD, the Gedda/Mathis/Fishcer-Dieskau (as Speaker) version has another awesome Queen in Cristina Deutekom.<br />Then we have the Queen of Night in the ROH and Salzburg productions sung by the immaculate Diana Damrau, who tends to make us all forget about Cristina Deutekom, Lucia Popp and Rita Streich. She is not matched by subsequent Queens, including Erika Miklosa (Abbado CD), Elena Mosuc (DVD with Harnoncourt), or Rancatore (DVD with Roschmann and Beczala).<br />Well, this Munich live DVD of 1983 is in essence a reprisal of Bernard Haitink's CD version of 1981 - also with Lucia Popp as Pamina, Edita Gruberova as the Queen, Siegfried Jerusalem as a heldentenor Tamino, and another heldentenor Peter Hofmann as one of the two Armoured Men.<br />This Sawallisch live performance of the same production (check out the similar CD cover) does not boost of such a stellar cast as the Haitink recording. The minor roles are less well known here on DVD than the Haitink CD version, but they are nonetheless well performed.  Norbet Orth is a particularly outstanding Monostatos.<br />The only personage who boosts of an `increase' of casting in this Sawallisch recording is Kurt Moll's Sarastros against Bracht in Haitink.<br />Even so, this Munich live recording is memorable for quite a number of reasons.  The first is Popp's Pamina, not so often recorded, and certainly not so in other video recordings.  She is middle-aged by the time of this 1983 performance, but she actually looked younger than in Kleiber's Der Rosenkavalier in 1979. Both her singing and looks convince the viewer of the youthful charm and innocence of Pamina.  As her `mother', Edita Gruberova is not in her best voice in this performance, and modern viewers would certainly mercilessly compare her performance here with Diana Damrau's ROH and Salzburg performances, both on DVD. Nonetheless, Gruberova's Queen of Night is still a force of nature with her striking stage presence and wonderful voice.<br />Wolfgang Brendel's Papageno is big and burly, certainly doesn't look like a big catcher, and he sings in a strong voice. Luckily, he is a very fine actor, and throughout his performance, he is dramatically fully alert.  He is certainly a more joyous bird catcher than Simon Keenlyside! As far as performance goes, the most convincing figure in this production is Kurt Moll's Sarastro.  I seldom see him in his prime, and lo and behold, what an imposing figure! Even more so than Rene Pape in this role, who doesn't own Moll's regal demeanour.<br />We do not have any Prince Tamino in the 21st century anymore, and in this 1983 production when Taminos are still in good supply, Francisco Araiza's performance could be termed as vocally outstanding but visually imperfect. His Tamino is certainly unsurpassed - not a Christian Strehl (Abbado), or a Michael Schade or Piotr Beczala could surpass Araiza's lyrical-cum-heroic portrayal of this quasi-heldentenor role.  Araiza's rendition of Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch&ouml;n is meltingly beautiful with superb breath and dynamics control and ardent lyricism, while in the Temple Scene he sings in an abandoning and heroic manner.  The only quibble of his wonderful performance is his stage presence: the not too long ago Prince Charming in Le Cenerentola (1980) has turned into a plumb middle-aged in less than 3 years' time, alas.<br />So, even if you have a better Queen ofthe Night in Damrau, and you have an equally good Pamina in R&ouml;schmann, you would not have as good a Sarastro as Kurt Moll, or a similarly capable Tamino as Araiza.Night in Damrau, and you have an equally good Pamina in Röschmann, you would not have as good a Sarastro as Kurt Moll, or a similarly capable Tamino as Araiza.

B008NABUU8|1.0|On my MyTouch 4G, I am no longer able to draw any bridge pieces after the first couple of levels. No matter how I click on the anchor points, it just pans the scene around.

Until then, Link is a much better choice.

076790382X|5.0|This is a book that is a collection of weekly news articles. Bryson wrote a weekly article for an English paper, that wanted to hear his tales of America.<br /><br />I really enjoyed them.  They are from a different POV of a man who is reconnecting with America after being away for so long.  Its an easy read. You can read any chapter. They're all separate from each other.<br /><br />It is written with a quick and dry sense of humor.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Once again Jo Nesbo kept me on the edge of my seat with his newest addition to the Harry Hole, policeman, series!<br /><br />  This time the focus is closer to home, zeroing in on the Oslo drug scene as experience by Oleg, the son of Harry's lover, Rakel. When Oleg is accused of murder, Harry must put aside his prejudices and delve deeply into the back streets and prominent residences of Norweigian society.<br /><br />  I won't give away the goods, but needless to say even though I've finished the book, I'm still on the edge of my seat, waiting for the next developments in this exciting series.

B0001AVZA8|1.0|I saw this movie on cable in the middle of the night during a bout of insomnia.  It wasn't a cure for insomnia, but that's the best thing I can say about it.  The fatal flaw to the film, to me, was how silly the characters were, especially Diane Keaton's character.  It was so over-the-top that it was like Diane Keaton was playing a parody of her character.  FYI, if you haven't seen this before and plan to watch it - this review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />I had hopes for this movie's redeeming itself a few times so I watched the whole thing.  Sadly, it didn't improve.  When Diane Keaton went on a ludicrous and embarrassing crying binge for what felt like weeks, it was just too much.  She'd only known Harry/Jack Nicholson for weeks (after meeting him because he was dating his daughter -- I won't even get into that) and only slept with him one time. But that was all it took to make her to sob and wail endlessly like a baby in the middle of a very extended temper tantrum. Erica/Diane Keaton actually cried longer than she'd known Harry, and that pretty much sums up this movie - juvenile, silly and annoying.<br /><br />Erica is supposed to be a wildly successful playwright, who, early on is presented as someone who is at least somewhat grounded.  Then comes Harry/Jack Nicholson, and one night of passion with Harry turns her into a hysterical woman.  The question I kept asking myself while I was watching this movie is this:  Did Erica really need to act so whacky, immature and unstable - giddy one moment, burping another, then freaking out the next moment, and sobbing the next?  And is this supposed to be funny?  Sadly, in spite of an outstanding cast, it was not funny.

014241493X|4.0|When I first ordered this book I wasn't confident that I would like it at all. I only bought it because I loved Looking For Alaska, and I was ordering The Fault In Our Stars so thought I'd buy this too. When the two books arrived I read Paper Towns first, because like I said, my expectations were quite low.<br /><br />But once I started reading it, I found myself completely connecting with the characters and genuinely loving and enjoying the book. It keeps a great level of suspense and you find yourself unable to put the book down and I read through it in one day, my need to find out what happens was that strong.<br /><br />The mystery of Margo was the focal point of the story, but upon a second reading I found myself paying more attention to Quentin and his thoughts than the clues left behind. Whether or not that was because I already knew the outcome I think is irrelevant, because Quentin is a brilliant character in his own right.<br /><br />The ending I am still a bit ambivalent about, because - without giving any spoilers away - I liked the point the ending made, but I just didn't quite believe it and felt an alternative end could have been more satisfying. But, nevertheless I think it was a very enjoyable and easy read and I definitely recommend it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Heat Wave was a cut above some of the books that have been made into series.  It was fun without being campy.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I love Tina Fey's comedy style and writing on SNL and 30 Rock, but I did not love this book.  There were some interesting parts, but as a whole, the book was bland.  It was fun to read about 30 Rock and get some insight on the other actors and writers, but otherwise, the book seemed very high-level.  I would not classify it as a memoir.<br /><br />If you can borrow it from a friend or library, it's not a terrible read, but don't waste your money.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Not very many books can make me or have made me cry, but this one did more then once. Its such a good book with a sweet love story that had so much more!
B0098WWEH8|4.0|This album can be played beginning to end with no skippers -- very solid album. I think they've taken some big steps forward in their song writing and collaboration. I've been very impressed with the album and would suggest this if you enjoyed their last album. This one is better.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The first book is only the beginning, but you will find it rich in new ideas.  The people in the story come to life in a natural way that you don't even notice as it happens.  Howey did an excellent job of not getting in the way of the story.  Definitely a good read.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|I want to be very careful not to reveal the outcome of this gripping novel. Nesbo is now in the same league as Larsson, and as writers who invest careful and very clever subplots and interweave elements of the story throughout, are a joy to read. These guys are master architects and builders who have thought through the minute details to give their stories depth and surprise. This sort of writing is a working-reader's delight: no laying back and lazily reading along, waiting for the plot to slide towards an outcome. Their writing is straight-forward but still complex with enough surprises to keep the reader working but hooked. And outcomes are not necessarily neat, reminding us once again that life is not coasting - but often messy and inconclusive. Bravo!
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Order was easy, came when it said it would and in great shape. This was a bday gift for my brother and he loves it!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved it. Would recommend to anyone. Must read before you watch the movie, as the movie leaves out a lot of the important plot detail.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great story.  I love how the characters have grown and how Rick Riordan was able to unite the two groups.  I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy them together because I loved each of them separately.  But, Rick has proven once again what an amazing magician of the written word he is.  Perhaps we should call him the weaver! Now hurry up and release the 4th one...I'm so excited to see how the story ends.
B008NABUU8|3.0|I agree with others about the controls being difficult and the frustration of the Wifi requirement.  Bridge Hashed is a better app for Kindle users control-wise, also not requiring Wifi, however it is more difficult. I don't hate this app, it just doesn't work well on the Kindle Fire.
B001HN694K|5.0|Alice visits Wonderland as a child and grows up believing it as just a dream before it calls to her again, this time seeking a Champion to free Wonderland from the Tyranny of the Red Queen and regain the crown for the White Queen. While in the original story, the Jabberwoky was rather different, in some variations he is depicted as a dragon-like creature, so this is not new. The Red Queen has always been depicted as a tyrant,and it can be assumed that she might consider extending her reign during the time of Alice's absence from Wonderland. People tend to forget that Fairy Tales are not all sweetness and light, some can be extremely dark and this story focuses on this aspect as it mirrors Alice's dilemma in real life as a free spirit  who finds her life literally scoped out for her in a stiflingly arranged situation to a weak milquetoast nobleman. It is in Wonderland that she discovers her power as she reluctantly accepts the challenge of killing the Jabberwocky and takes over her own life once she reemerges from the rabbithole to reality and refuses to play the faceless wife while seeking a new destiny. This movie was beautiful without being \\"cutesy\\". It depicted Wonderland as more of a nightmare and the Hatter was a wild wonderful mad catalyst to spark Alice's discovery of self. It was dark, but there were still elements of fun and I found the movie enjoyable overall as different from other stories. I can accept this as Alice's last venture into Wonderland as a wild dark romp as Alice seeks to save the friends she made over the times she had visited before before leaving Wonderland forever to take up adventuring for real.

B009FOBMBI|5.0|This albums first single Chalk Outline is awesome, and what drove me to get it (along with seeing them last summer in the pit on Rockstar Uproar). They keep true to who they are compared to their last album Life Starts Now. Other songs I liked on here: Operate, Anonymous, Misery Loves My Company, Happiness and Broken Glass. If you're a fan of Three Days Grace, there shouldn't be a question of whether or not to get this album...
B008S847X2|5.0|John McLaughlin's 4th Dimension is one of his longest-running line-ups, centred on his partnership with keyboardist (and occasional drummer) Gary Husband, backed up by a series of bassists and drummers. The ensemble's 2010 offering, To The One, displayed a focus and consistent level of energy perhaps not seen in McLaughlin's albums since his Mahavishnu and Shakti output, even down to the sombre, pared down CD cover.<br />The cover of Now Here This shows McLaughlin in relaxed mood, posing with one of his favourite guitars. But the music herein does not let up in any way on its predecessor. Trancefusion kicks off with some high-energy guitar and drum improvisation before settling in to a complex time signature rock riff that must have made McLaughlin's entire day when it first came to him. Echos (sic) From Then combines a melody that could have come off To The One with descending arpeggio triplets that are pure Mahavishnu, as is the subsequent 7/8 rhythm'n'blues riffing. Guitar Love is one of the album's highlights, again starting with Mahavishnu arpeggios segueing into a swinging blues riff.<br />There are two significant developments on this album as compared to To The One (apart from being available on vinyl). First, Mark Mondesir has been replaced by Ranjit Bharot, frequently described as the \\"Indian powerhouse drummer\\". This is certainly accurate, but he lacks his predecessor's deft touch and witty interplay with McLaughlin and Gary Husband that made To The One such a joy. Second, McLaughlin has apparently switched from playing Godin guitars (a brand he originally picked up due to their advanced MIDI compatibility) to a Paul Reed Smith guitar, which he has described as \\"about as close to perfection as is possible\\". This is essentially a return from the super-strat Godins to a Les Paul-style guitar. The result is a grittier tone and, if such a thing is possible, even greater fluency on the fingerboard. On tracks like Call And Answer, McLaughlin seems to revel in playing this guitar more than ever. Quite simply, the playing on this album is astonishing in its energy and musicality as for its virtuosity. A definite Buy!

Yep, worth the money spent. What would I change? Well, maybe a hint button would be nice. Much like Bejewelled, same type of logic, but done better.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|First of all, The Phantom Of The Opera doesn't NEED a sequel. It's perfect the way it is ended, in a mix of tragedy and love. I've always rooted for Erik (the phantom) but in all seriousness, the part that makes me love POTO so much is the fact that he ISN'T with Christine. That's what makes me cry every time I watch the 25th anniversary performance. This is NOT a true sequel. I don't think Raoul would have become a gambling drunk, I think he would have loved and taken care of Christine to the best of his ability. And that whole thing with Meg and Madame Giry? Those were NOT the same characters I know. This show also does not have the ambiance of the original Phantom. It's brighter, flashier, and much less mysterious.<br /><br /> Now bear in mind, I very much enjoyed Love Never Dies. It is a great ALTERNATIVE ENDING, just as Susan Kay's Phantom had a great alternative ending. The music was good, I loved Gustave's singing parts, and the showgirl-esque tunes from Meg were interesting. I also found the Phantom's henchman delightfully creepy, even if their singing voices were not all that great. I did enjoy The Beauty Underneath, although it is certainly not a very \\"Phantom\\" sounding song. Devil Take The Hindmost was very good as well. Overall the music wasn't very \\"opera\\" at all. The costumes were spectacular. The sets were amazing. This is a great show, but NOT a sequel to POTO.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have adored Taylor Swift ever since she first sprung up on the country music scene a few years ago with her own rendition of Trisha Yearwood's How Do I Live?! Since then, it seems like she has taken the teeny bopper, pseudo country music world by storm and cemented her legacy as country music's version of Brooke Hogan...which is a good thing, actually.<br /><br />What I have always loved about Taylor is that she has always matured as an artist-diva, which is incredible because she's only 19, which means that she's been maturing faster than most people. I also admire how original she is, which is really h/a/r/d to pull off when you're still just a child. Signs of her originality and the fact that she has a highly intelligent mind full of untapped song ideas have been evident ever since her first CD, when she sang about crushes and teen boys, her second CD, when she also sang about crushes and teen boys, her third CD, when she sang about more crushes and teen boys, and, finally, on this CD...when she still continues to sing about nothing but crushing on teen boys!<br /><br />Another thing I admire about this artist-diva is the incredible genius of how she approaches a song and its structure. I mean, come on people: Taylor can easily teach some songwriting 101 courses at her local night school...easily! She can also teach these courses to struggling artists such as Mick Jagger, Phil Collins and Bruce Springsteen, duh. Her songwriting approach is uniquely masterful, which explains why she's sold so many records to undoubtedly equally intelligent and cerebral teen girl-fans.<br /><br />The songs on Red are a brilliant example of this too-clever-by-half songstress princess. She starts off each song around an ultra-basic, acoustic guitar melody (probably taken straight from a Guitar Hero track), then adds to it by incorporating ultra-profound and deeply meaningful lyrics about teen boys, crushes, diaries and teardrops...on a guitar, which she probably came up with while doodling on her issue of Tiger B/e/a/t or Seventeen. In any case, folks, this formula works, which is why Taylor is still my favorite of the TGPs (teen girl princesses), easily besting that Miley Cyrus t/a/r/t and that Christina Ahgwilera libertine.<br /><br />I have been listening non-stop to songs like State of Grace, Red and Treacherous on my transistor radio (it has its own AM/FM band, too!!!), and I continue to be just blown away by Taylor. State of Grace is clearly her ode to gospel music that smartly transitions to whining about teen boys on whom she has a crush. Red is clearly her feminista number that sounds like Lady Gaga sang it while wearing 10-inch stiletto heels and lipstick redder than Heidi Fleiss'; here, too, Taylor awesomely transitions to again singing about teen boys and having a crush on them, which I find truly imaginative and highly original. Even Treacherous is really hardcore before it also segues into being about teen boys...crushes on teen boys...and finally crying about not being s/e/x/e/d by teen boys while teardrops fall on her guitar. That is some powerful music, man; almost makes William Hung's broken English power ballads from back in the day seem merely human. Almost.<br /><br />While I clearly adore Taylor, I can't make this a totally favorable review. Thus, I have to bring in a slight critique of her, and I apologize to her tween girl fan base in advance for this. However, I think now, with her fourth CD, Taylor can do soooo much better. She should be pushing herself to new challenges and showing more growth and maturity as an artist-diva. She should be taking some lessons from Rebecca Black or at least from Double Take, especially their really sophisticated and soul-searching song called Hot Problems. Take Rebecca's Friday, for example. In that song we all love and listen to every day, Rebecca is able to masterfully take a very complicated topic (partying on the weekend) and turn it into radio gold that also inspires and teachesthe entire human race an important lesson about getting your priorities in order. Even the beautiful, young ladies from Double Take (whom I am watching with greater and greater desire) can teach Taylor a thing or two about expert songwriting. Note how their song, Hot Problems, was all about staying in school, studying hard, not having premarital sex, not doing drugs and valuing one's mind instead of one's body. I feel that Taylor should mature more by espousing these wholesome values instead of the \\"if it feels good, do it\\" ideology that she's been singing about.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I urge you to buy Red and help Taylor become a billionaire before she hits 25!! Her original songs full of awesomeness and intelligence warrant that. I mean, sure, she just seems to be fond of living a life of utter intemperance--going from the Jonas Bros. to Taylor Lautner to John Mayer to Jake Gyllenhaal to Conor Kennedy (my head is spinning!)--but at least she's still more honorable than Michelle Obama.the entire human race an important lesson about getting your priorities in order.

For Feynman, science wasn't a career, a hobby, or even his life's work. It was simply reality. To go through life without acknowledging the existence of science would have been like going through life without acknowledging the existence of water.

Everything flowed in such a way to lead you to buy in, even as you struggled to remember it was just a writer's imagination. I wonder if you really could live such an adventure-filled life without constantly being awed... or even aware... of it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys subtlety and shifting focus. And best of all, it's long enough to both whet and satisfy your appetite.

1401235417|5.0|Court of the owls is a bullet-proof near-perfect story with very little to complain about.  I will start off by addressing those of you who don't have much interest in the court of the Owls because they are just \\"Another group of Supervillains.\\"  The court of the owls are a very mysterious organization indeed, and their goals are very similar to those of most bad-guy teams, but there is more to them than what meets the eye.  I don't believe it is fair to just lump them off into a category with \\"a bunch of other bad guys who do the same thing\\" just yet because Batman's story has just barely Begun.  What makes villains interesting are their personalities and back stories because lets face it, most bad guys want the same thing even if they go about getting it in different ways.  The Court of Owls still have a lot more back story to go and I am most definitely interested.<br /><br />Everything about Batman vol. 1: Court of the Owls is basically a win.  Batman is interesting, but one of my favorite things about this story is the fact that I finally get to see some Bruce Wayne again.  I get tired of the way people claim that \\"Bruce Wayne is just a mask and there is only Batman\\" because without Bruce Wayne, and what happened to him, there is no Batman.  Without the Money Bruce Wayne inherited from his parents and continues to earn because he is an amazing businessman, Batman doesn't have the money or the resources to be Batman.  He might pretend to be more of a Party Boy than he really is, he might pretend to be a bigger whore than he really is (Okay maybe not) but Bruce Wayne and Batman still live by the same basic principles.  They still have the same basic goals, the only difference is one is exposed by the daylight, and the other is concealed by the night.  One creates Buildings, gives money to charities, and tries to bankroll the honest politicians he supports.  The other Fights crime, saves lives, and constantly fights the good fight and both make the city he Loves a better place so I don't really see how there is no \\"Bruce Wayne.\\"  They are two parts of the whole character that is Batman so I hope Bruce is never taken for granted again.<br /><br />The art is stunning and I personally don't mind that all of the bat babies have a lot of resemblance to Bruce because this makes them look more like a family.  Even Jason Todd, who is not in Batman just yet b/c he has his own comic, looks like his foster father.  I believe it was intentional and should not be complained about too much.  Also the choice to change the page layout for the labyrinth scene was a ballsy experiment and I actually really like it.  It helps emphasize that Batman feels out of his league and is losing his cool, his confidence, and his sanity.<br /><br />In Batman: Court of the Owls Batman is as sharp, cool, and interesting as he always has been.  It is a great showcase for the character with a story I cannot wait to keep on reading in Volume 2.  If you have any love for Batman at all, then you need to buy this book ASAP!

Very eye catching, dynamic shot. Wow!<br /><br />The only drawback is the leaflet. A very succinct history of Lauper's career. No chart positions, which album the songs are taken from etc.<br /><br />And Sony, where's the video collection? She Bop was hysterical - the part where Cyndi shoved a burger into the mouth of a leering man.<br /><br />True Colors The Best Of is easily the most detailed package and is a great update to the earlier Twelve Deadly Cyns.

B008AU7F3C|5.0|I must admit that this album, Bat For Lashes' third, took me by complete and utter surprise. While I'm normally drawn to more guitar-driven music, I am somewhat familiar with her past work, having enjoyed the occasional song featured on music blogs and such. But nothing could have prepared me for the lush soundscapes, exquisite vocals, and evocative, moving lyrics spread throughout 'The Haunted Man.' If you were to combine all of the best attributes from PJ Harvey, The Cocteau Twins, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Portishead, Kate Bush, and Cat Power, you might get a general idea of the musical artistry to be discovered on this album. It may seem somewhat sexist to do so, but it's hard not to compare Bat For Lashes' work here to those other groundbreaking, (mostly) female artists because, although Natasha Khan definitely carves her own path, she continues the tradition of uniquely talented women pushing the envelope, musically and lyrically, to create her own brand of genuine, introspective, blissful-yet-dramatic art-pop, much like the aforementioned artists.<br /><br />A perfect example is \\"Lilies,\\" which opens the album on an atmospheric, serene note, with angelic vocals over a swirling arrangement of synthesizers, strings, horns, and pounding bass that totally envelops the listener. When, at the end, she belts, \\"Thank God I'm alive,\\" it's nearly overwhelming. And that's just the opener. The exhilarating, freeing sound of \\"All Your Gold\\" is actually quite heartbreaking lyrically--concerning a woman's \\"good man,\\" who she can't commit to wholeheartedly due to her strong, lingering feelings for a past love--which creates some conflicting emotions within the listener, resulting in a unique and powerful listen.<br /><br />The synth-dominated, gorgeously-sung majestic beauty of \\"Oh Yeah\\" was impossible for me to keep from animatedly (and ridiculously) bobbing my head to it's slow-thumping, stuttering beats while driving last night, but the centerpiece of the album, for me, isundoubtedly \\"Laura,\\" a devastatingly beautiful, no-frills piano-laden ballad. It might be the least progressive, most traditional singer-songwriter type of song here, yet the sparsely arranged production--with only a gentle horn accompanying the piano--allows the listener to focus on the soul-stirring (and again brilliantly sung) lyrics, creating the perfect atmosphere to forget everything and lose oneself in for a few minutes.<br /><br />\\"Winter Fields\\" contains some pretty impressive dream-like lyrical imagery, such as \\"In sub-zero, I can't stand still, colors of absence flooding the hills,\\" turning Natasha's emotions into visually clear musical paintings in the listener's mind, and, combined with the rich, dense synths and gentle woodwind over a hypnotic, propulsive beat, creates a feeling that can only be described as euphoric. \\"A Wall\\" is probably the most instantly catchy song on the album, with a huge chorus that layers intertwining vocals and synths, with lyrics--\\"When you see a wall, I see a door...\\"--that, again, are extremely uplifting when combined with the soaring music.<br /><br />The album ends, much like it began, on an eerie, atmospheric note with \\"Deep Sea Diver,\\" which contains some haunting vocals over an almost scary curlicue piano-riff, ominous bass, and trip-hop beats, capping off 52 near-perfect minutes of some of the most stunning and sublime songs in modern pop music. It did take a few listens for me to break through the the (at times) \\"icy\\" exterior, but if Bat For Lashes' previous albums are even half as powerful and moving as 'The Haunted Man,' then she has definitely found herself a new fan. Fan as in \\"short for fanatic.\\" And I have a feeling there will be more than a handful of fellow new fanatics coming forward in the next few weeks. I'm just glad I've finally given her music my undivided attention, and I for one can't wait to hear where she goes from here.<br /><br />Good thing I have two more new-to-me albums to keep me occupied inthe meantime.<br /><br />{P.S. I'm really peeved I didn't get the memo concerning auditions for a \\"bony male, to be hoisted over a naked Natasha's shoulders.\\" Kidding...OK I'm not.}

It's a quick read, but one I'll return to at intervals. I enjoyed the three codas, as well, and really thought they added to the story. The free preview is plenty to give you an idea if you'll like the entire book - I'd recommend it if you're on the fence.

But I have to say, the more I listen to this album the more I love it! All of the songs rock, and the singing is better than I originally gave it credit for. I also have to say that I believe a lot of the negative reviews are by people who dislike the band now since Ace & Peter are out. I love those two as much as the next guy, but they had their chances and blew it. Twice. I think Paul's songs are much stronger than his songs on SONIC BOOM, which sounded too much like 80's KISS to me. Besides HOH, I think \\"Freak\\" is his best, and \\"Eat your heart out\\" is Gene's best. I love Tommy's \\"Out of this world\\" (and I loved his song on SB also). Sure it's an Ace knock off. He's the Spaceman of the band now. I've been a fan of Tommy since 1984. I wish Ace was still in the band, but he's not so take it or leave it! I also love Gene's bass playing on this album- he has some cool licks! All I can say is- if you're a fan, don't judge it on one listen.I think it will grow on you VERY fast! These guys have been rocking us since 1974 and are still giving the fans what they want- New music that STILL rocks!
B00005JNQS|5.0|Well the kids loves the movie. Robin Williams is louder and in your face in this movie. There's alot of simple childish  humor by Williams that kids relate to. Nice story moral in this movie about nit giving up on your dreams.

B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like the game a lot it is very much like the other Mahjong games I've played. However, this game keeps crashing my phone. When it works it's great, when it doesn't it's very frustrating. When I play more than two puzzles in a row it locks my phone up and I have to take out the battery to reset it. Playing Mahjong Deluxe D Free is the only time this happens.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|kindle fire crashes each time I try to open the game.  so I can not give an honest review of how it would be if it ran.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Doesn't go the way you may think of it as going.Does keep you interested in what will happen next though. I fell in love with the methodical points that aren't close to the \\"faity-tale\\" and how they were replaced slowly but way out of touch with the storyline.
B004P02OJ6|4.0|Great suspense movie, the build up makes the last 20-30 minutes really interesting. Scored it a four just because of the main cops acting skills...he was a little much.
B00902MCVY|5.0|After my first listen I was mildy disappointed at how short the album felt. There's 5 songs (2 of which are instrumentals) which add up to about 40 minutes.<br /><br />However, after listening to it a few more times, I didn't mind the length anymore. It's a beautifully crafted album with lots of complexities and layers in each song. You'll definitely pick up on something new with each listen. Every song is excellent, even the instrumentals.<br /><br />In comparison to Wintersun's self-titled debut album, Time I has less focus on the guitar, and more on the big orchestrated sound. There's definitely less of the \\"noodling\\" around on the guitar, but I personally don't mind. Perhaps Time II will feature more guitar-oriented songs.<br /><br />All in all - an superb album. They're expanding their horizons a bit with the big epic orchestrations while still sounding like Wintersun.

0345525558|3.0|A book club selection--not a book I would have picked up. Pleasantly surprised.  Good story, keeps you engaged.  A foster child, Victoria, has been through many homes.  Finally 18, she sets off on her own.  Finding work with a florist, she begins to counsel women on which flowers will send the right message.  And she receives flowers from a mysterious flower vendor.  Twists and turns and buried memories lead to isolation once again.  And, of course, a romantic encounter.  Well written with smooth transitions between memories and real time.  Read it, learn about the language of flowers and cry a little.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Sense it is the same people that made angry birds made this spinoff it is great and fun and I am sure that if anyone else had done this they would have screwed this impressive game.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Great Movie... I enjoyed it very much. It is really well done. I was sceptic about it at first, but ended up liking it a lot.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|This was an average sci-fi book.  Not the most creative story and overall not that gripping.  I only learned after reading it that the book was written for a younger audience but it does not matter how old you are with this book - it's just simply not a great book.  There are so many other books of this genre that far more interesting, entertaining and better written.<br /><br />I don't recommend it to the true sci-fi buff.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was impressed by the responsiveness and easily understood interface. AccuWeather tells both the current and future outlook without clutter, delivering details quickly.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|The level of detail is great, maybe a little too much sometimes, the flexibility of presenting the data is excellent and being able to know the moon status at anytime of any day or time is incredible.  I am happy with this app.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.  I actually stopped reading in the middle and read another book.  I then came back to it thinking it couldn't continue to be awful straight to the end, because, after all, this is J.K. Rowling.  This is the author who gave us Harry Potter.  This year, she gave us a loser.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|This movie is great I was amazed at the actors then and now . I was amused the entire time .
B007THA4FI|3.0|Having loved the Harry Potter series so much, I was somewhat disappointed in the book. For the first third of my reading, I'd pick up the book after a 2 or 3 day interval and have to figure out who all of the many, many characters were. By the end, the story pretty much came together, with many enjoyable parts, but I would not want to struggle with such a confusing cast of characters again. Also, since I am reading for pleasure I would enjoy more likable people.
1451627297|4.0|Stephen King's new novel, 11/22/63, is much different from any of his other famous horror tales. His former novels such as Carrie or Cell focus on well-detailed gore scenes while 11/22/63 displays less focus on gore and more on the construction of time, place, and character. Each detail is so well-developed that it creates a world of improbability and makes even the most impossible ideas seem possible. He grabs the reader by the throat and pulls him into a world filled with dangerous time traveling adventures that both the reader and the main character, Jake, are not sure they want anything to do with. He plays with the ethics of both Jake and the reader, creating a paradox that is difficult for either to understand. King's structure of this neo-time travel adventure engages the reader's attention by placing him in Jake's shoes and sending him back in time, allowing him to evaluate the ethics of changing history and how it may or may not affect the future. This reoccurring theme of \\"what-if\\" erupts throughout the entire novel and allows the reader to open his mind and evaluate what he would do if he had the chance to dramatically change history.<br /><br />Jake Epping, a high school English teacher living in a small Maine town, has little meaning left in his life. His wife, or ex-wife rather, leaves him for another man she met in one of her many AA meetings. Jake and his ex-wife do not have any children or money to fight over, making it a relatively clean cut for both of them.<br /><br />One night, while grading papers for an Adult English class, Jake is stunned by an essay that the school janitor, Harry Dunning, turned in. Harry tells the detailed story of how his father gruesomely murdered his whole family and how he somehow survived with only a few permanent disabilities. Jake's sympathy for the grown man now somehow adds another burden to his depressing and seemingly worthless life. Then, just when Jake thought that his life could not have possibly become more entangled with change and grief, Al, a local diner owner, lets him in on a secret.<br />There is a pantry inside of his diner that leads anyone who enters it back in time to their same small town in Maine on Tuesday, September 9, 1958. Al convinces Jake that he is telling the true and asks him to complete a few detailed missions for him, including preventing the John F. Kennedy assassination. Jake finally agrees to go back in time and attempt a few of his missions, including stopping Harry Dunning's father from massacring his family, but he is skeptical of what he can actually complete. Buying a Coke instead of a root beer in 1958 may not make a huge impact on Jake's current life in 2011, but interfering with something as large as Harry's father's murdering rampage or the JFK assassination has no telling of what drastic changes it may cause for the future.<br /><br />King has been known for his creativity and skill in producing award winning horror novels, but this one should not be disregarded for its lack of reoccurring vivid gore scenes. In fact, this novel may be one of his most well-written works yet. The size of the novel seems daunting at first glance, but his lucid use of language and broken down chapters creates short sprints rather than long distance reading. Also, King incorporates several incidents of humorous dialogue and internal monologue so that, despite the severity of the tale, the characters and scenarios have a lighthearted twist, but still seem realistic. This style makes it easy to find a good stopping point, but makes it difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />Needless to say that this is not a normal King novel, but it is by far one of his most extraordinary works yet. His subliminal question of \\"what-if\\" throughout the novel does not only create an interesting and entertaining story, but it gets the reader thinking about what he would do if something as unexpected as the opportunity to change history fell into his lap. King's brilliant work of time travel and murder stimulates the reader's mind by allowing him to decide what his own ethics are and encouraging him to avoid ignorance of historic knowledge as much as possible. This novel is a must read for those who are or are not King fans. It is by far one of the greatest works of science-fiction novels created thus far and should be read for the understanding of one's own views on ethics and ignorance and, most importantly, for fun. At the end of the novel, the reader should be able to ask himself what he would do in this situation based on his own balance of ethics and ignorance. He should also be able to understand why his decision is important, because every man is \\"changing the world. Only in small ways--infinitesimal ways\\" (105), but changing it none the less.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Different than most game apps.  Stratagey is key to being successful to move on to next level.  Keeps the brain sharp.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The main reason I started reading this book was because a lot of people had to told me it was good. For the most part I did enjoy it and read the book in like 2 days, but it's definitely not your typical romantic story. It's very different but at the end of the day it's just two people falling in love with each other.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the coin dozed game makes u feel like u r really at the arcade. the bonus is u rn' t really blowing ur money. in other words get this app it is awesomely awesome.

B0086700CM|1.0|okay I loved this game. okay? but then my dad put it on the cloud. I asked if I could put it back on the device and I put it back on. I opened the level and it made me start all over from the beginning. I had all the characters and it erased it all. anyways I played it and it wouldn't let me turn. then I put it back on the cloud.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|I was hoping this product might solve some of the aspect-ratio issues that are so common in android video viewers, but it doesn't. There are no significant enhancements in this from the basic viewer that comes with the fire.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I too will wait to get this book free from the library- am I the only person who has found that the last few Scarpetta novels describe a generally dislike-able, petty and egotistic Kay Scarpetta? I haven't read this book yet, granted, but already I see that she's now suspecting Benton of an affair and likely feeling insecure about their relationship- bring back the thoughtful, intelligent, good friend Kay Scarpetta of the earlier novels who, like another reader noted, was an on-the-scene forensic examiner par excellence - and put this whiny person who seems to have a touch of some personality disorder away! Then I'll resume buying this series the day it comes out!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover!  Got my Kindle Fire for my birthday and wanted to make sure it was not only well protected while carrying it around or tossing it in my purse, but I also wanted it to look good.  I've received so many compliments about this high-quality cover that looks just like an old book.  It's not only beautiful, but functional.  I like that the cover is not flexible at all, so there's no worry that something pressing in from the outside would still be able to push into the screen. The elastic IS quite snug, but that makes me feel more secure, knowing it will not easily slip off and put the Kindle in danger of falling out of the cover.  I used the pocket inside the cover to tuck in the instructions for cleaning my screen protector and a microfiber cloth to clean off the Kindle when needed.  The Kindle can be installed in any vertical direction, so I actually use mine upside down because I want the cord to come out the top if I have to have it plugged in while using it.  This cover allows the Kindle to be installed in any direction and still be able to plug it in.<br /><br />Great item, high quality, and very pretty!  Highly recommended.
0307361012|2.0|I am so glad that I read this book, The Bat, after I had read all the other Jo Nesbo books. If I had read this one first, then I would have given his subsequent books a miss.<br />There are several inaccuracies about location; people in the city hardly use that type of Aussie slang, it is more confined to the rural areas or 'the bush\\" and The Dreamtime stories are used as padding and seem to have very little relevance to the denouement of the novel.<br />The characters aren't as well developed or complex as in his other books.<br />All in all a huge disappointment.
159562015X|4.0|Beware: You need the \\"Unique Access Code\\" in order to take the Strengths Finder 2.0 assessment and access the SF 2.0 website. Unfortunately, the only way to obtain your code is to buy the hard copy book; the access code is provided in a sealed envelope attachment at the back of the book. I ordered the Kindle version and, guess what? NO CODE! BTW: DO NOT BUY A USED VERSION OF THE BOOK! If the previous owner opened the code's envelope and used the code therein, you're NOT going to be able to take the evaluation. It's one code to a customer.<br /><br />Another problem I encountered: After buying a new hard copy of the book, I tried to enter my access code on the website, but received an on-screen error message stating that I had already taken the test! I e-mailed the HELP DESK contact address provided, but have yet to hear back from the SF 2.0 \\"team.\\"<br /><br />Coupled with all the other caveats (i.e., you are only evaluated for five strengths points, you have to pay an additional fee to carry the evaluation to its logical conclusion, etc.) associated with this self-improvement scheme, the problems I have encountered so far prevent me from giving SF 2.0 a rating of more than two stars. If my access problems are resolved satisfactorily, I will revise my comments and rating accordingly. For now, all I can say is caveat emptor! (I bet the Wall Street Journal reviews editor didn't have MY problems when s/he placed this book on the WSJ Bestseller list.)<br /><br />23 October 2012 UPDATE:<br />I'm changing my rating of the SF 2.0 product to four stars. The Gallup HELP Desk agent responded to my e-mailed complaint within two days, and with her (\\"Cynthia\\" was the name given) help, I was able to access and complete the SF 2.0 Strengths Assessment. I was VERY satisfied with the personalized reports and action plan provided at completion of the assessment, as well as the additional FREE downloadable documentation.<br /><br />Note that although you will only receive a profile ofyour top five strengths, Gallup researchers have found that when assessment participants were given their results for ALL of the strengths addressed in the SF 2.0 assessment, they tended to lose focus and concentrate on those other less-significant strengths, rather than the top five, which the research has shown are MOST RELEVANT. This seems a valid justification for providing a limited set of results.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone interested in leveraging their personal strengths in pursuit of a career or in their everyday life.

0380730405|5.0|Rebecca is a flashback about a nameless young woman who becomes Mrs. de Winter and how she fares at Manderley. In her flashback, the heroine meets Maxim de Winter in a hotel at Monte Carlo. She is a paid companion to a Mrs. Van Hopper. After courting for only two weeks, Maxim asks her to marry him; she accepts and they go to Manderley, his home.<br /> Once at Manderley, the heroine finds out how Maxim's first wife died, or so it seems. However, the heroine is intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who was very fond of Rebecca when she was living. The heroine learns about Rebecca's beauty, charm, grace, and reputation, all of which seem impeccable. She believes that she cannot live up to Rebecca's legend and that Maxim is still in love with Rebecca.<br />  One day when a ship runs aground in a cove near the Manderley home, divers surveying the wreckage find Rebecca's boat with her body in its hold. Rumors spread like wildfire. Maxim is forced to tell the heroine the truth. (Spoiler Alert. The succeeding paragraph has been removed for that reason.)<br />  The heroine is relieved to find that Maxim never loved Rebecca. There is an inquest, causing Maxim much anxiety. (Spoiler Alert. The succeeding paragraph has been removed for that reason.) Despite much hardship, Maxim is exonerated. On their way home to Manderley, Maxim and his wife cross a ridge just miles from Manderley and see it in flames. The story ends intimating that Mrs. Danvers was responsible.<br /><br />This story is so beautifully worded that the words flow through the mind and over the tongue like smooth water.<br />At first the beginning of the story is confusing, but everything quickly falls into place.<br />The unnamed heroine is so easy to identify with, as she seems to embody every thought of naivety and well meaning intention.<br />The values of loyalty, honor, and love stand stronger than the forces beyond the grave. The elements of revenge, duplicity and fear are woven throughout the story. A way to cope with fear is evident in the unnamed heroine's story, causing it to be a story not only of resolve but of courage and triumph..

B009KHBDUU|2.0|I usually enjoy this combination of actors & directors, but in this case I could not stay awake to the end.
B0078JPCJK|5.0|Fantastic with great actors, beautiful surroundings and very good storyline. Fell in love with this series. Keep them coming. The history is alive.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well first of I love the game but however... At Google play store I can get this for FREE!!!!! Please amazon! Can you at least get a demo or a free version like block story!!
0525953728|4.0|Book was well written and a quick read.  It was \\"chuck full\\" of what the governmet would consider \\"classified information\\"  Tactics equipment ect. All and all since it is out I really do believe the public has a right to know about  these things.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very sensastional yet bewildering at the same time, but still a must read for anyone who believes in fantacy!
B0091REZMW|2.0|Great game and graphics. I love meeting & chatting with friends. You can meet people from across the globe. Game is varied & challenging for players just starting out. Once you reach a certain level (varies by player, but about level 175)...there are no new quests, events or updates. Kindle players have not had an update since April 2016.  We also are not getting the items we need for collections and to keep playing. For many of us the only reason to keep playing is to touch bases with friends we've made over the years. Requests for updates go unanswered by Game Insight. The game used to be tremendous fun...now, not so much!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Once i started reading it I couldn't put it down and can't wait for the next one to come out. Would definately recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it!!!!  Although felt the very end was rushed....could have went on forever and I would still be engrossed. Katniss is entriging......Peeta draws empathy....
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Closer from Blade Runner than Alien in term of the themes the director is exploring.<br />Life and death. The search for the creator. What's the human soul.<br />Very well played and directed. A lot of very deep thoughts. I loved it.<br />Special effects and ambiance are spotless.<br />I assume that some people will hate it because of religious reasons.<br />A lot of open questions too, which I like, but can bother some people.<br />I saw it twice and will defenetely watch it again.
B009KUANWG|5.0|This is a phenomenal Bond theme by Adele.  Rather than go for the emotive, throaty vocal of \\"Someone Like You,\\" Adele proves her range with the slow-burn vocal that weaves in and out of the dark, brooding, Bond-themed arrangements.  I have always loved Adele, but this track made me respect even more.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|The acting is very good and the episodes are well written and suspenseful. I was just surprised at<br />the nudity - it's not necessary and it's offensive!
B0086700CM|5.0|I was having a boring day until I saw one of my roommates playing what seemed to be an interesting game on her phone. I asked her the name of the game,  and she said it was Temple Run. I got it on my kindle and seem to now fit in Temple Run into my daily To-Do list of tasks. Temple Run is an amazing game that will certainly captivate much more people as it did me :)
B008FPOIT6|5.0|It's been a while since I read a whole book in so short a time. When I read a brief description of the book in Wired, before it was actually published, I knew I wanted to read it. It had all the elements I love: an ancient cryptic society, old books, lots of tech references. I bought the Kindle version (seemed appropriate given the subject) and finished it within a week. I found the characters engaging and the story flowed along nicely. This book re-kindled my love of reading books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is good but I got it for free!  It is a good game and if you can't find the free version don't be. bothered by me and go ahead and buy the game.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm ready for the next Blake Crouch book, while I was enjoying this book I could feel my heart racing wondering what was coming next. Great page turner!

B001IF252M|5.0|Had to order the mini displayport to VGA adapter for my macbook, last minute. Needed to hook it up to a projector for a funeral. It got here quickly, and worked perfectly. Decent speed, no problems with anything. I was worried about it staying put, but it didn't slide out of the port on either end. No quality adulteration at all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I recently purchased the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy for my kindle and read all 3 within 2 days. I couldn't put them down. They were really good. I recommend them to anyone over the age of 18.

B006CQLGXG|5.0|A Christmas Carol is a classic tale of Scrooge and three ghosts. The book and its images transferred well to my Amazon Kindle app. I recommend this story to everyone, especially those interested in British Literature during the Victorian time period.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I moderately enjoyed Avatar the first time I watched it on DVD after skipping it in 3D in the theater.  You can really see the work that went into the effects in the 3D version.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I have never read any J K Rowling books prior to The Casual Vacancy as the 'Potter' genre does not interest me.  However, knowing how successful a writer she is, I thought I might give The Casual Vacancy a try.  I loved it.  I became totally enmeshed in village life, and could actually see, hear and smell the characters.  The poverty, mental illness, philandering, family violence, bullying and general angst are real facets of the tapestry of our everyday lives, but are often hidden from view.  The way this was woven into the story line was both empathetic and emotionally challenging.  I thoroughly recommend this book with it's raw and gritty characters - it's a bit like peaking behind the white lace curtains of the village neighbourhood - you just never know what really goes on in others' lives.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|loved the beginning but it got slow about half way through. Too much romance, not enough plot moving the story forward. To be honest I still need to finish it.
B0064XE4WC|5.0|I always love this story, and still do.  I wanted to have it on my Kindle so i can hopefully read it to my Grand-Daughter.  I want to introduce it to her at Christmas time in hopes that she will love it as much as i do, and her mother too.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I should have waited till part 2 came out then got it at once but just couldn't wait. I enjoyed it very much. Even though robin is a girl. Sorry.
0803738412|5.0|This is a longer book, but our 2.5 year old still loves it. Loads of fun to read to her, especially with all the different \\"sound effects\\" like a snapping broom or roaring dragon. One of our favorites!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Been a big fan if all the movies never played the games so I'm not the typical fan boy hater who can't stand these. Pure joy to watch. Very well done. Will watch all they put out.
B0002DG5AO|5.0|Awesome!
B007THA4FI|1.0|None of her characters were likable. None of the story lines had anything remotely uplifting to them. The cursing seemed arbitrary and while I normally enjoy a book the expands my vocabulary, this time the choice of words often seemed as though she copied them from a thesaurus. Only Roget would have been familiar with some of the words. If you are hoping for a character to cheer for or a story that renews your faith in humanity, The Casual Vacancy ain't it!
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I saw the movie in 3D in theater and was an awesome movie. However when I purchased the Blu-Ray 3D 4-disc collection set from Amazon, none of the disc would play in my Pioneer Elite 3D Blu-Ray Disc player. I troubleshooted and made many attempts and nothing worked. The disc had no aparent scratches and are completely clean. I can play any other 3D Blu-Ray movies, but not this one. I even tried playing the 2D version and that also didnt work. Looking online I discovered many other people are experiencing the same problems. So evidently there are some bad batches of defective disc. I am going to return my 4-disc collection set of Prometheus to Amazon for a exchange. I just hope I get one that works. Otherwise I would give it a 5-star rating, as I loved the movie.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I bought this DVD because I love this TV series.  I have all three seasons.  Maybe Santa will bring me Season 4.
0307720950|5.0|This book is about making physical stuff, not bits and bytes. Makers stokes the latent dreamer, inventor and entrepreneur in oneself. Inventors, futurists and opportunists will love this book.<br /><br />I had good fortune of hearing Chris at the Direct Marketing Association trade show last week in Las Vegas. In that speech he convincingly presented reasoning on why big data really has begun and will continue to shape the future - especially in direct marketing. He made a pitch for his new book, an autographed copy for $20. I bit.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down until I couldn't read any longer.<br /><br />The book begins by sharing Chris' experience watching his grandfather invent a better sprinkler system, but be held back by the in power disparity between producers and inventors. He articulates how that has shifted and today in effect and entire ecosystem is in place for the inventor to also be the producer and retailer. He ties together the ability to invent and produce in 3d printer technology, the ability to market test and get seed funding via Kickstarter.com (who's own interesting start-up story is nested within Makers), and sales via sites like Etsy and beyond. Very electrifying and will keep you awake with a myriad of ideas running through your head.<br /><br />Their are many other cool companies profiled in Makers. Very inspiring!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

The album is filled with perhaps some of the most underrated (yet best) songs of her career. The album is sassy and it shows that, yet, again P!nk isn't caring what you have to say about anything! She's still the in-your-face pop punk that I've come to know, love, and expect! I only have one regret: this was the last CD of hers I got... I'm not sure why, but I couldn't find it anywhere on the planet! I ended up caving in and buying the 14-track edition (\\"Hooker\\" being the fourteenth track, a hidden track). I must say that, next to perhaps Truth About Love, this is one of her best albums! It contains the best songs of her career, but she's still underrated. This CD wasn't given the recognition it truly deserves! It's a wonderful album, and I recommend it highly!<br />It is probably her second best album (Next to Truth About Love, which is epic, and then Funhouse being the third (an awesome album, but it's overrated. It's famous because of all her hits from that one album). I tend to fall for the underrated music more than the popular music. And this CD is full of that!<br />If that is what you're interested in, I highly recommend giving this album a try! P!nk was younger, and it's obvious in this CD. But, as any fan of P!nk ought to know, every time you have a session of listening to P!nk music, it's always fun, regardless of your life or any details of your existence. Try This is no excuse!<br />I enjoy it highly! If you buy it, you're getting fourteen great songs from the greatest voice in musical history! Don't take my word for it! Buy it for yourself and see!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I had been listening to some of the Lumineers music on You-Tube.  The more I listened the more I enjoyed.  It has been a very long time since I have purchased any new music.  The simple, basic, well written songs are a refreshing change from what I have been hearing.  Highly recommend the purchase and encourage you to at least check them out.  Enjoy![[ASIN:B007M45PMU The Lumineers]]
B001I8A76A|5.0|This album is P!nk's most noted. The album contains many of her hits. This album is hailed for having the songs that made P!nk famous.<br />That being said, the songs on this album are, for the most part (and while awesome), terribly overplayed. The songs are on the radio all the time, and the hits really aren't as good as everybody says they are.<br />Now, the album is awesome! It's really fun, it's got some awesome P!nk stuff, and it also shows what she is like, and why I love her. Let me explain: P!nk made music even when people wouldn't listen to her, when nobody seemed to care. That is why I admire her. She isn't too scared to do what she wants, to follow her gut, her heart! She continued to make music, and now this CD has made her into the sassy pop punk icon she is today: P!nk!<br />And I love her! So, although I don't think as highly about this album as her others, I still think it's awesome! It's probably the third on her \\"best album\\" list, behind The Truth About Love and Try This, tailed by I'm Not Dead, M!ssundaztood, and Can't Take Me Home.<br />Every P!nk CD is always fun! When you sit down to be visited by P!nk, you are going to have fun and you won't ever leave happy!<br />Now that you've read my mini-rant, it's your turn! Check P!nk out tonight! Order the CD, and you won't be disappointed! If you buy it today, in a few short days, you will be treated to 12 swell songs from P!nk, which (and I'm stealing Stephen King's quote from Just After Sunset Introduction) is no poke in the eye with a sharp stick!<br />Happy listening!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Talk about a guilty pleasure, the Fifty Shades Trilogy certainly qualifies for me!  I loved these books and savored every word, salacious or not. No, the books are not literary gems, but I really was transported to another world (actually, I should say worlds). I don't understand how I could relate so easily to the diverse experiences and roller coaster emotional issues of Ana and her beloved Christian.  I am 70 years old and have never experienced anything close to their many unique trials and tribulations.  The third book really pulled it all together for a wonderful happily-ever-after ending.  The plot had predictable twists, but I loved it all anyway. It seemed as if there was an opening at the end for the possibility of more books to follow.  Truly, I don't know what could be added after Christian is freed. Will there be a movie?  That really does not matter to me.  It couldn't possibly be as good as the movie I produced in my imagination!
0345803485|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book but after a few pages into the read it kept getting better and better. Even though this book is oriented more towards women it is a good read for men as well. I strongly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have not finished this book. So far, it is interesting and very erotic.  I would advise an adult rating.
B009KHCRVO|2.0|When I read the description of this movie, I thought 'this could be funny'...I was wrong. It had it's moments, but the plot was incoherant at best. This was a 'Scary Movie' type of film, less the talent and a decent script. I might have liked it, but given what they did to the American astronaut, I was dumbfounded at the lack of any Micael Jackson jokes. Another low point was when the jilted PR rep, now appointed commander of the US space ship 'George W Bush', arrived on the ships bridge in...what were they, feathers? It was pathetic. The premise had a lot of promise (sorry), and even with some minor tweaks this could have been a decent movie. Besides the previously mentioned items, cut out the 'National Anthem - pull handle in case of emergency' idea (pure Mel Brooks, but out of place in this clunker), lose the 'UN' fist fight over the issue of Helium 3, and make that a bit more serious. I wonder how many viewers actually watched long enough to see the inadequately explained nuclear exchange taking place on earth. I can only hope that the pan out from the moon to the earth in full nuclear war then to Mars doesn't point to any even dumber ideas for a sequel.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The sad,sexy story continues leaving me wanting to read more and more. You are drawn in from the first line and you begin to root for this couple like no other.
B008NABUU8|1.0|Pro:<br />- Acceptable permissions<br />- Gorgeous graphics<br />- Interesting concept (bit far from unique)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Simply unplayable due to horrible controls<br />- Agonizingly slow, even on high-end (quad core) devices<br /><br />While pretty to look at, it fails as a game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been waiting on this app and I love it. I haven't had any major issues. some loading problems every now and then but nothing outside of normal app malfunctions.  great app overall
B0094KF4WG|3.0|Mark Owen says his book is a true account and I have no reason to doubt him but still I do.  It reminded me of Sergeant Saunders from Combat, a 1960's TV war drama series where they regularly took on overwhelming numbers of Germans and always won and rarely took any injuries and never had a platoon member killed.  Owen seems to have spent his Navy Seal career in a similar bubble which culminated in the assassination of Bin Laden.  That said, No Easy Day is an entertaining read and I did enjoy it.  If you feel like a bit of good overcoming evil in a light, easily digestible format then this could well be the book for you.
0439023491|5.0|Love it? Of course I love it!! Second book in the Hunger Games trilogy. I started reading yesterday and was half way through it by last night. What will Katniss do?? I can't wait to open the book this afternoon after work and find out!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved this book and the continued love story. If you love Fifty shades of grey you will love love this book.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Haven't bought a CD in a long without downloading it first but after seeing them live I had to own this immediately. Haven't found a CD I enjoy more.
0316228532|4.0|If you're expecting a Harry Potter for adults and will be satisfied with nothing less, don't buy this book.  The Casual Vacancy is a well written novel populated by depressed, angry, trapped, betrayed and disappointed characters and it offers a startling glimpse into life in England that is rarely seen by starry-eyed anglophiles. The language is definitely \\"adult\\" as are the situations Rowling describes.  This book covers sexual abuse, petty crime, methadone clinics and all stops in between. It is not a cheerful book, it is not a happy book, but it is an intriguing book and it makes me anxious to see where Rowling will go next.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have loved this story since I was a little girl.  It is like comfort food on a stormy day.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Although this book is well written as one would expect, it lacks plot, and does not inspire any personal connection to one character.  While reading I felt as though I did not care about what happened to any of the characters; thus it was hard to get through.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|Watched about half of this and wanted my money back.  Not engaging on any level. I was surprised, as I usually enjoy Burton and Depp. Very rare that I won't at least give a film a full viewing, but I just couldn't see this turning around.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Really fun and challenging however there are moments when it freezes completely this is bad because I am a 3rd grade teacher and we use Ipads to read in free time well I let them download this game and all the ipads were ruined and had to get rid of them....somebody let me know when ipads are selling for 5 bucks...lol I need 32
0425263908|5.0|I loved everything about it from start to finish. Can't wait to read reflected in you... Looking forwad to finding out what happened in Gideons past.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I cant get off my kindle fire. all those who voted 1 star are weird because you don't know what u r talking about
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|An excellent continuation of the series, it has an interesting plot line, with many twists and turns that you wont be expecting.and a nail-biting ending,  that will have you on the edge of your seat till next October! i would definitively reccomend it! :)
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I believe the primary author signed an agreement not to publish anything about his work for the government without prior permission to do so.  He broke that agreement.  So I look forward to government action to ensure that neither he nor his co-author benefits financially from this book.  Sorry--the rules really are rules, even for brave, capable warriors.<br /><br />The book is a well-written page turner that you can whip through quickly--very light read that moves right along.  The primary author states that he was inspired by a similar book when he was a boy, and I expect his book to inspire others to follow in his footsteps in the future.<br /><br />As a professional policy analyst, I found little I could use to improve my understanding of special operations or the Bin Laden raid.  It would be hard to believe that any of this book could be considered classified.  It adds fascinating details about the raid that help bring it to life.  But as I closed the book (actually, my Kindle--this book is IDEAL for Kindle reading), I concluded that the life of a SEAL is pretty much what I had imagined.  And the raid went pretty much as I had expected.  I have no special access to the special ops community; the book simply puts some meat on the bones of what I imagine special ops to be like:  Brave, driven, committed, hyper-fit, smart team players doing good work for their country that would be unavailable to them anywhere else.  We're lucky to have them.  And they are lucky that we need them so much.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I am glad I read the book so that I can comment on it knowledgeably.  It taught me little that I did not already suspect.  I hope it attracts new talent to the special ops community and benefits the families of those already in the community.  And I hope the government enforces its own rules to make sure these co-authors do not benefit financially from breaking some very basic rules.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is such an awesome app! its amazing! when ever my friends come over, they always ask if we can play together. there are so many levels. you will never be bored!
B003D81NVQ|5.0|The best writing and acting I have seen in years. It is filled with suspense, action, intrigue, and humor. I do NOT want it to end at the end of Season 5. Please reconsider, Mr. Gilligan!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This sequel is pure enjoyment! I love how she writes these books! I can't wait for the last book! I love the love story between these two damaged lovers! But they always manage to see that they are so bound to each other! Love it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest!!!!! I am so addicted to this app... I have it on my kindle fire and my evo 4g!
055380684X|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Truly made me look at how I teach and coach and take a step back to evaluate what has worked over the years.  Have actually started reading it again, and suggested all my peers read it as well.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game it's the best! get it get it get it!!! I play it all the time. and you will to
1452110581|5.0|I idly picked this book up---mainly due to the title---while browsing in a stationery store. I do not have a cat. And yet, I was laughing out loud while reading random poems. I decided to buy it for a friend who has cats. However, once I got it home and read it cover to cover, I had to keep it (my fave? \\"Kubla Kat\\"). Now I'm about to order a couple of additional copies as gifts for friends with cats. Again, I do not have a cat and I can't believe I'm writing a review on Amazon for a book entitled, \\"I Could Pee On This.\\"  And yet, it is HILARIOUS. Trust the reviews.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Simply awesome. Goes by quickly but is an amazing read. Teens can easily relate to some of Charlie's feelings. And i cant help but make a connection between Holden from Catcher in the Rye and Charlie. If you enjoyed Catcher, I think you'll like this. Its incredible.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|The movie was advertised in the new Cinderella DVD my daughter received. She said \\"Can we watch Tangled?\\" Netflix didn't have it available to watch instantly.  I hopped onto Amazon and Voila!!! I ordered it up for us to watch Sat. night and finish up on Sunday morning. The 48 hour rental period was awesome.  The movie itself is a great 'take' on the classic Rapuntzle (sp?).  There were a couple scary parts (for a 3 yr old) but I was watching with her so I reminded her every movie has a villian!  I love Amazon instant video!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I happen to find this game to be a refreshing, fun twist on the match 3 style of puzzle games.
B008NABUU8|4.0|The game play is alright, it is a little difficult to select where you want to put items, but I found that if you use a mouse (I have an Asus TF101 with the dock) it makes it easier to play.<br />I do agree with the people saying that it is slow, it took 3-4 seconds just to load the screen to ask if I really want to close the program.<br />They do have a button to shut off the music, but I would also like to at least quite the sound effects.<br />I would say get this game while it's free, as it is at least worth playing with a little bit.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Absolutley amazing start to season 3 cant wait for more episodes and to see if they are gonna try to stick closer to the comic!!
B005O7PSRO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the instant video service Amazon now provides. It is easy to use and is a great place to catch up on missed episodes for a small price. I especially liked the 1 click pay system that allows me to pay for the next episode/video with nearly no interruption in my video viewing!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book was such a treat to read, completely engrossing. If you enjoy thinking about the idea that we are just one layer of this reality, a follower of Jung, a lover of history, this book is so for you.
B004LROMX4|5.0|I was skeptical when this first came out. Then I watched and episode and that was all she wrote. Dealing with the downfall of civiliaztion as we know it, and the tenacity of those people fighting back and the aliens that caused all this, makes this a really good series..I can't wait for season two to finish so I can add that to my collection. Noah Wylie (the Librarian movies--yeah go figure) and the suporting cast does a good job to bring the best out of this series...If you haven't gotten this yet, pleas do.
B0083GQF70|5.0|A great end to this season of How I Met Your Mother. A must watch if you're a fan of this show at all.
1567312373|5.0|Hilarious long novel. David Foster Wallace meets Philip K. Dick: Imagine a world where Illuminati and and Anti-illuminati forces contend for world domination and good looking chicks. There are many plotlines and lead characters, but the novel is legible and well-constructed. COINCIDANCE author and Playboy's 1960s era editor Robert Anton Wilson is a great writer and thinker, and Robert Shea is the co-author. Very raunchy sex scenes. Very 1974 American hipster humor.
B008NABUU8|5.0|If you are at all a physics fan then this is the game for you. Permissions are at a minimum. I love games that make you think and this one involves bridges. Build them within budget and you go to the next level. Great game
B008SVFX96|2.0|After his first solo album ... the superb \\" Stranger In This Town\\" ... I was firmly convinced that Sambora was the creatively superior one in the Bon Jovi / Sambora writing team ... now in 2012, I'm not so sure ...<br /><br />Sambora's 2nd, and this, his 3rd solo record are quite forgettable ( as are all of Bon Jovi's albums since \\"Crush\\" , except for maybe \\"Lost Highway\\" )... in my opinion, that could be attributed to the idea that he has lost sight of the type of songs & sound that made his 1st solo record so good ...quality songwriting, catchy riffs, solid vocals & harmonies, and NOT over produced ...<br /><br />One can only hope that at some point going forward Sambora recaptures the formula that he had when he did his best work ... but few artists ever do, because it is my feeling that an artist has only a certain number of good / great songs in them.<br /><br />But I'll take mediocre Sambora music over just about anything else being released these days ...
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I enjoy a good psych thriller. This was a very good one. The movie all came together at the end of course but in that it keeps you on your seat.
B000HEVALC|5.0|This CD collection gets us to the raw beginnings of Rock and Roll.  You can hear the camaraderie and the fun they had making it and also the respect they had for each other. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in the roots of Rock and even today's music.  Hear where it all started where it all came from.,
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was an amazing autobiography.  I could not believe that a 22 year old girl<br />was walking by herself on this long trail and carrying such a heavy pack both<br />mentally and physically.  She preferred to walk by herself but made many friends along the way.  I think this would appeal to either gender.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Love the construction of the sentences.  One of my favorite books around..  Will read it again for the enjoyment.  Have recommended the book to everyone I know.
B008NABUU8|4.0|fun game. minimum 20 word reviews suck, though. this is a rating for a game, not an essay. still, the game is a fun enough to waste time on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was absolutely addictive.  I couldn't put it down.  Not only was it full of hot sex scenes - it had a plot that never quit.  So many twists and turns and not predictable at all.  I love when a romance novel is unpredictable because the plot is so good and the characters are so well developed.  Can't wait for her next book!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think it jumps around a little too much but after reading the first two books it was hard to put down.  Can't wait for more in this series.
B002APU580|5.0|This is the movie I watch over and over again.  I am a fan of Jane Austen and this is my favorite of the movies.  Keira Knightley is just amazing!!<br /><br />The movie was delivered super fast and came in great condition!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a an awesome book and wish that more young people would read and apply this in their lives.. Again awesome read!!
B009FZZFME|5.0|My family comes together on Sundays for dinner and (TV) drama. It looks like season 3 is off with a bang! We love this show!<br /><br />That said, we are all very unhappy with Dish Network's shenanigans with AMC. Our homework for the week is to research alternatives, be it Roku, Hulu Plus, or Direct TV. But each our households will be dropping Dish Network before month's end. We are not interested in being pawns in a legal dispute.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have just got back into reading on a regular basis and had to read the 50 shades trilogy to see what all the hype was.  After that I wanted another book and seen these books were recommended.  I am so glad that I have read them.  I honestly could not put either book down and cannot wait for the 3rd one.  Great book!
B009439HEY|5.0|I really enjoyed Genesis Revisited (though with a few artistic questions) so I have been looking forward to Genesis Revisited II. After purchasing it this morning and listening to all tracks, I can honestly say that I am more of a fan of this album than the last.<br /><br />This album contains re-arranged hits such as Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Ripples, Afterglow, The Musical Box, In That Quiet Earth, and my favorite of all, Supper's Ready. While his artistic choices of arrangements are unique that I like for the most part, Steve Hackett has managed to keep the artistic integrity of Genesis while exploring new sounds and new techniques with these arrangements.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this album and I highly recommend it to all Genesis fans!
B000WYCF6Q|2.0|I rode an entire summer in Manhattan without a mirror, but after a close call, I decided it was high time to get some added protection and visibility in a city that has proven quite unsafe to cyclists.  I purchased 2 of these mirrors and placed them on the underside of the handle bar of my Trek 7.3FX hybrid, just as it had been mounted in the picture of the item on Amazon.  They looked great! I was thrilled as they did not take much space and looked rather cool. Then I went on a ride.  Immediately, I realized i had to bend my body to even see anything.  Fail. So i just turned them around and placed them on the top of the bicycle handlebar.  The maneuverability of the mirror was nice. I could flip them over and turn them around, which was great, but still the visibility was very limited.  I still have to pay very close attention to see anything on the mirror.  A quick glance is not enough at all, but rather you have to search the mirror a bit to see clearly. - This is quite disconcerting, because I find myself not paying attention to what is ahead of me and that can have deadly consequences - especially in a city such as New York, where a cyclist may only have a split second to check for traffic coming from behind. Perhaps I am not yet accustomed to them, but I think it is more due to their ridiculously small size.  I can hear the car before I can see anything, and by then it could be too late!  I did not find the image too distorted but rather just too small to be useful.  I will try other mirrors, that are larger and provide the security I need without compromising the aesthetics of my bike.  Either way, good concept, but poor execution.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked 50 shades then this is the next series for you. Awesome book about those who are imperfect even if they appear to be perfect.
B008MEM24S|5.0|spin off of wheres my water, it's great love the levels and the challenges through-out this fascinating the game. no age limits.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|E.L. James did his homework well when he chose the pieces for this CD.  Some of the best classical groups in the world today play these beautiful selections.  A deep sensuality resonates in every piece.  I think even people who are not fans of classical music will enjoy this CD.  Lush, sensual, even erotic; if this doesn't set a romantic mood for you I don't know what will.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Amazing Movie.  Must see for any Comic fan.  lots of action and true to the spirit of the Comics. can't wait for the next one.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun relaxing.  continuous play.  gret graphics.  had a restart over over so hope it is fixed. works great tonight.  highly interested in 3 match that deviate.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|can't seem to get the app to load properly on kindle fire hd. nothing wants to function properly. needs some major fixes
B006UG90RM|5.0|Guitar Hero is a term thrown around loosely these days and often overused....but not so when talking about a one Edward Van Halen.  The beast of a monstrous guitar god had been somewhat dormant and tamed down during much of the ballad laden Hagar years. While good decent moments and a rightful rock living legend like Sammy on vocals they had good albums,sold out concerts,and #1's...no doubt very successful. No disrespect to Sammy as I consider him a top vocalist,hell perhaps better than Roth....just not BETTER for Van Halen. I often found myself listening to Women And Children, Fair Warning and comparing it to 5150 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and thinking what's different?...the manic frantic guitar solos and that psychotic drumming of the brothers railing n rocking to that furious rhythm and the chemistry shared with the devilishly clever n humorous charisma of the gift of gab..Mr. Diamond Dave himself.  And with the new album its that sacred old school sound again! It just feels right at home with the classic albums while still offering something new. I would be also crazy not to mention the class and amazing commitment Wolfgang Van Halen has brought to the album's performance...great bass,great background vocals...yes he keeps improving,and yes it sounds like Van Halen...by the way check the last name..love Michael Anthony..he's awesome but Wolfie is showing he belongs and listen openly and you will hear that the new Van Halen and old Van Halen are not a different kind of truth but the same.  Peace!
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Kurt Wallender series is at an end.  I hope Mankell develops a new character who is either detective or lawyer.  No one writes about modern day crime like Henning Mankell!!!!  The last book in this fabulous series is 5 star--must read!!!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Loved this movie, I saw it with my young Daugher at the theater. When my Daughter saw the scene with the space ship and all the elves dropping from the ropes to deliver the toys, she turned to me and said \\"so that's how they do it\\".. I almost had tears in my eyes!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Great fun waste lots of time, lol greatly recommend this app get it now or else aliens will kidnap you
0345803485|1.0|This has got to be the worst book I read in the last decade. Basically, it's 'softcore' SM porn thinly disguised as a - very badly written - love story. Really, I'm no moralist, and 'good' porn can be fun to read. But this is just so badly written! The worst aspect of this book, as other reviewers have noted, is the repetition, the repetition, the endless, mind-numbing repetition. By the time I'd read for the 5th time about 21-year-old-hitherto-a-virgin-Ana's 'earth-shattering', 'obliterating', etc.etc. orgasms, for the 25th time about Ana 'biting her lips' and 'how distracting' this was to 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey, and for the 50th time about how 'hot, hot, HOT' - sorry, did I mention HOT, really, really HOT? - Christian was, I was ready to throw in the towel. Or rather, throw away the book. Or rather, I left it at the first hotel we stayed at, for someone else to enjoy. What a waste of time and money. How this ever made any bestseller list is totally beyond me - total and complete garbage.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun... entertaining. The only drawback is that I got through it too soon... BUT you can repeat the levels with more challenges.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|it did give me my songs but I had to try very hard to find them not as good as the other youtube app.
B004UPANAI|3.0|The movie had a decent story but was from no part of the comic lore.  Cheesy in parts, exciting in others--it was a diverting piece of entertainment but the CGI showed a bit much
B002UHSDUK|5.0|\\"All My Life\\" and \\"Pretender\\" struck me right out of the gate, though with each listen I find myself enjoying the rest of compilation as well.  It has been a long time since I heard a straight-on rock band that can rock me, though I cannot explain how I've missed them for nearly 20-years, but that void went away after watching their \\"Back and Forth\\" documentary.
B0052REQLK|4.0|Even though the information and stories from the elders interviewed weren't startling, it was a comfort to read about what really matters in life that goes beyond making more money than God.  I appreciated the reality check.  If you are unsure about your life path and choices, this is a great, quick affirmation.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this series.  Well written in the first person.  You really feel for these characters.  Only wish they were longer.  The sign of any good book.
0525952926|5.0|can't wait for the last book in the series, though I am a History Major, I learned so much that I didn't know or understand. I believe this should actually be required reading in world history classes.  Plus you have the qadvantage of a good story along with the facts

B0053JJLLC|2.0|This book was written like the script for a film; pretty shallow on something that has already been done.  I think that Preston has his eye more on the special effects and $$$ this \\"book\\" might bring in a film rather than focusing on producing a good read.  Overall a D and if you take into account the fact that the original idea came from Crichton, an F for Preston.

0307730697|5.0|I had reservations about buying this book because I'm not usually that 'inspired' by inspirational books, and I didn't want to read a dramatized, hero-worship novel. Thankfully, Fearless was anything but that. Meticulously researched - the amount of anecdotes that come directly from people Adam knew is astonishing - and the story of a life that needs no more drama, Fearless is the rare life-changing book. Exceptionally well written, and telling a story that isn't suspenseful, but meaningful - the story of a man who kept going when he could have quit a hundred times. Pick it up today.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|The Settlers of Catan is the object of many a late-night game marathon with our cousins. It's more strategic than most other board games out there, not based just on luck.<br /><br />The board is different every time you play the game (the island is set up randomly), so no two games are ever the same. It's a good strategy game, the objective being getting points from building roads and settling the island, building an army, etc. You collect resources with which to do all of that on rolls of the dice.<br /><br />We didn't end up liking Seafarers much, but the Settlers of Catan is one of our favorite games. If you want to play with more than four people, you can buy the extension, which allows for two more players.<br /><br />It's a little unfortunate that they no longer make tiles of the same quality they did with the original editions, but although these feel a little cheap, they're not too bad.

B0036T31YY|5.0|So another scary movie Sunday has passed and I discovered another gem.  While this one is more of a psychological horror thriller than just your average horror film, it is definitely worth the time.  Triangle is free on Amazon Prime, if you have it.<br /><br />This is one is a little difficult to review without spoiling, so I cam going to do my best here.<br /><br />From the opening scene, you know there is just something off about Jess.  She is the mother of a autistic son, who is just doing her best to take care of him by herself.  Their morning routine is interrupted by a ring of the doorbell.  Jess goes to see who it is, but no one is there.  She gets in the car and drives away.  You see her drive from the point of view of the seagulls flying above.<br /><br />Cut to the harbor.  Jess' friend is the skipper of a sailboat and a group of people are getting ready to go on what looks like a short day trip out on the open sea.  The relationships between all of the people on the boat are set.  Not everyone knows each other and not everyone wants Jess on the boat.<br /><br />A mysterious storm approaches...destroys the boat and leaves just as mysteriously as it has appeared.  As they are struggling with the loss of one of their ship mates, a large cruise ship approaches.  The group appears to be saved,  But, of course, that is never the case....<br /><br />I will not delve too much into what happens next because that would spoil a truly terrific and terrifying ride.  The audience is left to figure out what is going on along with Jess.  Something is wrong here and as she discovers just what the problem is your heart races and sinks at the same time.<br /><br />I read many reviews of this and for some reason, it left many watchers confused.  I think that people need to pay attention.  This is one of those movies that if you do not pay close attention the story will lose you.<br /><br />Now is this entirely new ground? No.  But, it is done with a new perspective and even a little research into the name of the cruise ship may key the watcher into what is going on here.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  While, I had heard of Melissa George before, she was almost unrecognizable here.  From a quick review of her imdb profile, it looks like she is turning into quite the little Scream Queen.  If she continues to pull work like this, I think this is a good thing.  Anyone can scream, but you can see the desperation on her face here and she starts to realize what it is that she must to do make it right,a little research into the name of the cruise ship may key the watcher into what is going on here.<br /><br />The acting is superb.

1469984202|4.0|These short stories woven into a bookwould be most enjoyable were this a screen play and movie.  The books were quick reads but just when I was finally happy with a character, it was over. I never got to the last stories because I am hoping there will be a movie and for once ever - the movie will be better than the books.
0345529057|5.0|At first I thought it was terrible and lost when the author addressed some of the characters by two different names. But later goggled it to find out the characters, and enjoyed it. A lot of disturbing stuff in this book as well, such as old men and whore houses. Indefinably made for adults. Overall a great book series.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|Well...she had done it again. I love Taylor Swift. Theres just something about her voice that makes my day a little better. Her songs grow on me. Every album just kind of grows on you until you find that you know every lyric of every song. After first listen I was like...\\"Huh?\\" And then another listen. And another. And now I'm thinking out loud \\"YES!\\". She does take some leaps on this album. Experimenting with different beats, different instruments, and pushes super close to bubblegum pop, maybe even too far for some fans. But, this is Taylor Swift after all and Swifties will love her efforts and style. Some songs stand tall and others fall short. Among the best are Begin Again, I Almost Do, All Too Well, Treacherous, and Everything has Changed. Among the different are Red, I Knew You Were Trouble, 22 and State of Grace. This IS a different album. Some songs don't feel polished and this is completely different than previous albums. Some songs aren't lyrically 'heavy' like I Knew You Were Trouble, State of Grace, and We Are Never.... Is that a bad thing? No. Its just different. Every album gives us a new take on where she is musically and lyrically. Bottom line. Go get the album. You know you want to!
B000PHN4HE|2.0|I had fond memories of watching Short Circuit as a child, so I figured it would be OK to watch with my young sons.<br /><br />WOW I WAS WRONG...<br />Now, if you don't mind foul language in front of your kids, then fire this movie right up.  The story is still reasonably good and entertaining (even though seeing the electronics of the day is quite amusing).  However, if you do mind bad language, let me tell you that it's chock full of bad language.  My wife and I ended up turning the movie off because of the language.  I really don't remember it being that bad.  Maybe I watched an edited version when I was a kid.<br /><br />To make this review concise...<br />If your value system allows for you kids to be exposed to a lot of bad language, by all means, watch the movie.  It's fairly entertaining, even though it's old.<br /><br />If your value system DOESN'T condone this kind of language, I'd steer far away from this.  There are many better options out there.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I bought this anticipating the same intensity and creativity that came from Harry Potter. Silly me, this is boring and heavy. If you aren't British, many things don't make sense.

If you have not read the Percy Jackson series or the continued Lost Hero series then you will be completely lost. I had read The Heros Of Olympus eight months before I read the Mark Of Athena. I was lost, after re reading Heros and once again reading Mark Of Athena everything clicked into place. I cannot wait until House Of Hades finally comes out. Keep up the good work Rick Riordan!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|When I ordered My Week With Marilyn, I had 2 concerns. One was that I would be as disappointed with it as I was the book it is based on. The other was that as a big Marilyn Monroe fan, I would not like the performance Michelle Williams gave.<br />Well, I am happy to say I was wrong on both accounts. Although based on the book of the same name by Colin Clark, I chose to overlook whether I believed the story to be factual or not and just based my judgement on the film itself.<br />The casting was spot on as Kenneth Branagh once again gives an amazing performance in his portrayal of Sir Lawrence Olivier. Michelle Williams more than impressed me in her portrayal of one of my favorite Hollywood icons and her Oscar nomination was well deserved.<br /><br />Even The supporting cast of Judi Dench, Eddie Redmayne , Julia Ormand and Emma Watson were all very well-casted.<br /><br />I have to say regardless of it being fact or fiction, it was definitely entertainment and a movie I will surely watch again and again.

Only trouble is that not all the stories are in the same order!  A quick bit of research shows that this volume is the one in error.  I've also noticed that there are lots of little typos throughout the work.  The paperback has it correct and the e-book is always wrong.  Typo's and story order are inconvient but it not so bad and the thing only costs 99 cents  so I really can't complain.

B009KUANWG|5.0|The amazing vocals of Adele and the classic James Bond style music combine beautifully to make this a subdued yet stirring song.
0316212377|3.0|\\"The Wasp Factory\\" was one of the first non-SF books that I was able to appreciate, while I would list \\"The Player of Games\\" and \\"Consider Phlebas\\" as two of my favorite books. I also have enjoyed recent works like \\"Surface Detail\\" and \\"Matter\\". I only purchase books from two authors, Iain Banks and George RR Martin, otherwise I just wait for the copies from the library to become available.<br /><br />This book was very readable, but very frustrating because nothing really happens. The setting for the book was based around subliming, a mysterious process which is mentioned in passing in several books of the culture series. Perhaps Iain Banks was tired of questions about this process and decided to write a book. In this book subliming is just used as a MacGuffin. In fact, I wonder if Banks is having a sneaky laugh at religions, because subliming seems very similar to the idea of an afterlife and makes no sense at all.<br /><br />Perhaps this quote from GRRM is relevant. \\"For magic to be effective in a literary sense, it has to be unknowable and strange and dangerous, with forces that can't be predicted or controlled. That makes it, I think, much more interesting and evocative. It functions as a symbol or metaphor of all the forces in the universe we don't understand and maybe never will.\\"<br />Perhaps better not to address subliming.<br /><br />This book makes Banks look a little sloppy . I love the way he writes and his imagination. But there seems no consistency in travel time, distance, or the power of the ships. In other words, the physics of the book seems really contrived: One ship can travel from star system to star system in a blink of an eye, but other ships are seem unable to go anywhere.  Compare and contrast to GRRM, who spends two years rewriting a book to make the travel internally consistent. Another problem is that the culture ships are too damn powerful, when there is action involving the Ships it hard to care, as nothing can happen to them.  If something does happen it just doesn't seem consistent or believable. Additionally, another character has the power to deactivate culture technology, but it is never explained how and later in the book they seem completely powerless.<br /><br />The culture books are beginning to become depressing with regards to human nature. Apparently, when all want and need is satisfied then extreme hedonism becomes the norm, and people automatically become narcissistic sexual deviants, acting like fifteen year-old boys (forty penises...really?!).  Even renowned Hedonists like Epicurus felt there were limits. Sometimes a simple life is enough. I suppose this would be too boring, better to grow forty penises.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Starts out OK. Then ruined by some of the stupidest scientists in existence.<br /><br />I could not finish this flick because of how idiotic the characters are.

0062024329|3.0|I ordered this book as a present for a niece. I was under the impression that the entire text of the book would be there, with illustrations of the characters in each page. The artwork is great, reminiscent of \\"Prince Valiant\\", but the backbone of any book, especially THIS book is the text. Not all the text appears in this graphic novel. It should be advertised as a \\"Graphic Novel of an abridged \\"The Alchemist\\" \\". The page for this listing does not mention the book is abridged; only the author briefly at the beginning of the novel alludes to its abridgment. A big disappointment.

B008ENA74E|1.0|The must-read book on the subject of Wall Street (and political & academic) corruption is NOT this book but Predator Nation http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DXOQMC/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img<br /><br />Smith spent at least the first 60% of the book (as far as I got before returning it for a refund) illustrating how wonderful and exceptional he is. I wearied of the book before he got to the point (if he ever does -- I don't know) of Goldman's wrongdoings and and suggestions as to how they might be prevented in the future.<br /><br />So now I know how smart he is and that he wasn't a Rhodes Scholar only because of prejudice against his American patriotism (and he was wrong: Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11). And that he really threw that ping-pong contest.<br /><br />Big deal. I no more wanted to read about that stuff in this book than I did in \\"Liar's Poker\\", another book I returned.<br /><br />It is high time for someone to write an expose worthy of being called one, instead of simply being marketed as one. Perhaps \\"marketing\\" is part of the larger problem.<br /><br />Smith writes engagingly, but wastes his talent on constant self-aggrandizement and declaiming others, whether directly, by damning with faint praise, or by pointing out their probable ulterior motives. Did you know that Hank Paulson escaped capital gains tax on nearly $500 million by leaving Goldman as CEO and taking the job as \\"Dubya\\" Bush's Treasury Secretary?<br /><br />One also wonders why Smith took so long to come to realize that all that wrongdoing was going on, and then resign. If you read this book you may find out -- if you can trust this author.<br /><br />I learned that he is paying his sister's college tuition and writing opinion pieces for Goldman that is winning kudos. I hope he didn't break his arm patting himself on the back. Oh yes, at 30 he was \\"the patriarch of 25 relatives and conducting and explaining the Seder  (something the eldest mail in the family does). Were he not Jewish he'd be bucking for sainthood.<br /><br />In the immortal words of Hunter S. Thompson (written in 1968 about Hubert Humphrey), Smith's testicles should be removed to prevent his genes from being passed on. He is simply the most boastful, ingratiating, piece of slime ever to crawl up American shores to enter the cesspool of high finance.<br /><br />I'd guess that Goldman fired him (the book promos hint at that) and that his book is nothing more than an assertion that he's a martyr. and an attempt to profit from even that.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|After 50 shades this is the best read so far nothing comes close.  I was unsure about anything to read after 50shades but am so glad I read this. Can't wait for the 3rd book!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I actually enjoy Donald Fagen's solo work more than Steely Dan.<br /><br />The new one, Sunken Condos seems to percolate with a groove. All the elements from the Nightfly trilogy are present in new songs. There is nothing really new, but the result is pleasing. The emphasis on blues guitar is a nice touch. If you like Donald Fagen you will probably like this, but new listeners hearing Sunken Condos for the first time will really dig the groove. It is not just for long time fans.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling can certainly write, and I think this is a great though sobering story.  The only difficulty is that there really aren't any redeeming characters here.  It's quite a cynical world view coming from someone who wrote so exceptionally about good versus evil in the HP series.  The second half moves much faster than the first, and though I still think there were a few too many characters overall, she pulled everything together by the end.  Now I just have to wait for her next book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It took me a couple of tries to get into this book at first. The overall story is solid but I found it difficult to really get attached to characters as it lacked interesting dialogue. In my opinion we should have seen more of Gale in the opening chapters so that we get a real sense of the love triangle that's to come and i really wanted to see more of Hamish as well.I was totally hooked when I reached the Hunger Games event, it was exciting, tense and gripping throughout, I couldn't read that part fast enough. The character building or lack thereof just left me wanting a bit more, perhaps that's been held back so that we can appreciate it in book 2??? I love a good romance element but it fell a bit short of what I've come to expect. To be fair i suppose book 1 is called the hunger games and i felt that part of the story to be completely fulfilling. I'm still interested to find out what happens next, I've held off on watching the movie until after the book so perhaps that will add more emotion to the story.<br /><br />Updated after movie - if I thought that the book was emotionally cold in places boy was the movie so much worse, poor camera work, poor casting, the games themselves were completely lacking in intensity compared to the book, they were lack lustre and lifeless, many details from the book were omitted. A huge opportunity was missed here to make the movie even better than the book and take it to places emotionally that the book never did. It has left me feeling cold. I know Jennifer Lawrence has unfairly received a hard time because she's deemed overweight, a beautiful girl, but on the casting as a whole you do expect the characters to be svelte, running around, climbing trees with ease etc. but it just looks like they walked into a regular high school class and picked a couple dozen random people to play these characters, which gave no credibility to the story as it contradicts descriptions given in the book. This has nothing to do with the review of thebook i know, but I urge people not to bother with the movie, as it has actually put me off reading the next instalment.

B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book is good- not great- if you are a Kay Scarpetta fan.  As another person stated, the great Scarpetta books all seem to be at the beginning of the series.  However, the story line is tight, detailed, interesting & well researched.  The usual characters are present with their same flaws and strengths, and some new ones introduced that may make for interesting future stories.  There are, of course, some clever plot twists, and since others here have accurately or otherwise revealed too much of these details, I will not elaborate further.  (I will say that I wish the fritatta receipe was included in the book, as I could practically taste it while Kay was cooking.)<br />My biggest criticism of the book is the same one as several other Scarpetta novels:  in contrast to all of the details presented in the first 95% of the story, the ending wraps up much too quickly and cleanly, and then the book simply ends.<br />Cornwell is a genius at timing the release of her books.  Every year, around September, I start jonesing for another Scarpetta novel.  This book is satisfying, and now I find myself waiting another full year for Kay (and, hopefully, the fritatta receipe) to reappear.
0984380213|3.0|I completed reading Predictable Revenue and I have a couple issues with this idea of adding an extra step before contacting your decision maker with a cold email. As optimistic as I would like to be, I cannot totally buy into this idea until I find a worthy explanation. I looked several times for the answers inside the book but could not find clear answers. My questions are: When emailing our initial point of contact, why is it recommended that we target a C-Level executive rather than going straight to the decision making source? How does simply mentioning in an email: \\"Mr Smith mentioned you were the person I should contact...\\" increase the odds of receiving positive feedback from our decision maker?<br /><br />Furthermore, I can call the gatekeeper and receive my point of contact's email and phone number almost 100% of the time. This seems like a better idea than hoping the C-Level executive will send me the same information via email. Mr. Ross mentions this feedback is only received 10% of the time. It seems as though this idea calls for an additional and unnecessary step that increases the chance of having our emails deleted which ultimately decreases your chance of contacting your decision maker.<br /><br />In addition, say you actually do receive an email back from the C-Level executive with the point of contact, you then have to cold email the decision maker after all, which puts you in the same position you were before you contacted the C-Level Executive. I did not see a clear purpose behind adding this step, and I am a little skeptical of going all in with this idea. If It were immediately apparent in the book, and this approach was backed up with a thorough explanation and concrete supportive data, then I would rate this book a lot higher.<br /><br />What I really liked about this book is the idea of specializing your people with very specific tasks. The idea of wearing different hats to satisfy your peers and your boss is just nonsense. Having laser focus, and a precise purpose will make each person the work place far more productive than taking on several roles.s, and a precise purpose will make each person the work place far more productive than taking on several roles.

0316228532|2.0|I'm probably only one of two living human beings who has not read the HP series, so I have no preconceived notions about this author.  Having said that, I must say that I was very disappointed in the character development, style, and substance of this novel. I found myself neither liking nor caring about any of the characters, and my desire to finish this book was really impacted by this. I agree with another reviewer that the author seems to have thrown every imaginable social issue into this book - politics, domestic violence/abuse/neglect, drug usage,alcoholism, socioeconomic issues, teen angst - you name it, it's in there!  I did finish the book because I always do, and palmed it off to my niece with a very clear warning about how much I hated it.  I will be anxious to hear her opinion, since she's a JKR fan.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have been a long time fan of the reacher series and have read all books in the series at least once. I was almost hestitant on buying with all the bad reviews. I'm glad that I bought it anyway because I really enjoyed it. It felt like a classic reacher book. it did focus on reachers train of thought and how he calculates things in his mind but those were in the other books as well. I liked the methods of deduction by the law enforcement agencies and reacher to try to figure out the crime puzzles.The action was a little slow through some parts but It was hard to put down and I finished it in only 3 nights.It felt like I was hanging out with reacher and getting an insight into his mind. Probably wouldnt read it again like I did with some of the other ones, but definatly dont hestitate buying it if your a reacher fan.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|It should make it clear that this is a comic. I was expecting a standard movie. Not bad for a comic film if one is into taht kind of thing. but in that case animation is lacking luster.
B002RHGYOA|4.0|1/3 of the book is just story about Dragon girl... and then is the rest of the story with held me to the book till the end. I had fun of reading it and recommend it without any hesitation.
B0051UH6YM|5.0|Fantastic book.  how I wish I could find all those extra and missing apostrophes.  May be find the extra ones and put them in the missing places.
B004SDEP38|2.0|Umm.... you need the full version to start a new document. Useless much? I mean, I don't just want to edit a document, I would like to be able to start one.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book is \\"too clever by half,\\" as the British like to say.  I felt it was too strained, too verbose, and completely unreal.  The characters changed their personalities too frequently (even when they were not meant to) and I really had a difficult time accepting the narrative.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I actually love the original characters from Game of Thrones, Tyrion being my personal fav for his wit and intelligence. In Dances with Dragon he' s lost that special quality perhaps its because he is now looked upon as \\"kinslayer and kingslayer\\".  God, the author makes this guy's life a living hell. Despite what his father has done to him I believe Tyrion would not have slain him.  He maybe (or was) the only honorable Lannister.  Anyway, Dances with Dragons just don't have the intrigue that the first two books had. An epic does not require all the people in that world. Stick with the ones that got you there even if we lose a few.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|While I love the crossfire series and will be buying the last book when it comes out next year, I was a little disappointed in the second installment. When we first meet Eva she was a strong, independent, self assured, somewhat scarred, woman. I liked the differences I noticed between her and Anna, the leading lady of the 50 shades of grey books. Anna was always clumsy and unsure of how she should act and be around Christian while Eva was confident and didn't take giddeons crap. Until the second book anyway. In the second book there was just too much undying need to have sex, all the time. Don't get me wrong, it's a great read. But Eva became dependent on even catching a glimpse of giddeon then on just living. And there were a lot of questions I really hope are answered in the final book. Giddeon treats Eva very poorly in this book and even though in the end you find out there's excellent reasoning, I'm not so sure any woman in her right mind would be able to just swallow all he did down and love him anyway. But Eva,I suppose, isn't exactly \\"sane\\". I enjoyed this book but mostly, I had a pit in my stomach of sadness through the whole on Eva's behalf. We do discover the underlying reasoning behind Gideon's night terrors but I'm curious to see where the author is going to take the story and how she will wrap it all up without making giddeon and Eva seem completely ridiculous. And I really hope she gives Eva her strength and self confidence back because the Eva of the second book, if she were my friend and putting up with that crap, I'd slap some sense into her. Fingers crossed for the third book to blow my mind....
B008220DIC|2.0|Director Paul Thomas Anderson once again proves that he is incapable of telling a compelling story.<br /><br />Anderson is great with a camera and Phoenix is seething in his portrayal of an alcoholic wanderer...<br /><br />But there is no story here. The second half of the film is just a boring wasteland of wandering.<br /><br />Awful film.
