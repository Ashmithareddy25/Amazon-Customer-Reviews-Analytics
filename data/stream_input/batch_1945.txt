B0083Z614S|5.0|A wonderful story with a message for all ages.  Enchanting and spellbinding, it is a tale that understands the magic of a child's imagination.
1439127700|5.0|Attention political junkies, presidential historians, journalists, Mr. and Mrs. citizen, politicians and even world leaders! The President of the United States has a secret weapon the pentagon, CIA, FBI, and secret service can never hope to obtain! Uniquely American and amazingly effective, the \\"Presidents Club\\" includes all of the ex-presidents. This group has formed an unusual and very small fraternity who support each other while serving the sitting president behind the scenes. After reading this book, you will realize that \\"the club\\" believes in preserving the prestige of the office of the president and will go to extreme lengths to protect it.<br /><br />This book is extremely well researched, and different from other straight forward non-fiction books that are written about the presidency. A new perceptive of relationships,  friendships, rivals, legacies, power of the office, and a new \\"day in the sun\\" for ex-presidents is written with amusing annotates to show just how isolating and difficult the president's job is.<br /><br />It is very interesting to read about the image of the office, how political parties become blurred or irrelevant, and how this \\"club\\" has been one of the best kept secrets to everyone except those inside the inner circle of politics. In fact, even the president's closest aides are often unaware of the lengths the president will go to elicit the advice and assistance from the members of the club.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book showed the human side of the actual men themselves. It was touching to read about the close relationship between George Bush and Bill Clinton, and how Bush pulled aside Clinton at his presidential library to suggest that he think about a specific spot for his gravesite. At another point in the book, I couldn't help but laugh when Clinton sought Reagan's advice on a matter, and Reagan decided that Clinton needed a lesson on saluting the troops. Reagan then proceeded to spend an hour showing Clinton how tosalute along with colorful commentary while Clinton practiced.<br /><br />If you are a CNN, CNBC, or FOX television junkie, this book is for you. It will fill in many of the blanks you never knew existed, and many of the key players in history who are on these shows were actually part of many presidential administrations. In fact, they apparently had a front row seat and unique insights into what actually happened as aides, campaign managers, or some other important role in the oval office.

B006VRDZ44|3.0|Well acted and beautiful sets and costumes, as a period piece it is well-done. But far too much violence. I didn't get interested enough in the characters to care about what happened to them. I won't be watching beyond the pilot.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|i like it because it keeps your attention yet you can quit and come back to it.<br />a stimulating challange

B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love the sequel to the hunger games. Suzanne Collins kept me turning page after page unwilling to put down my kindle. She creates a world with characters who try to have humanity for one another but the capitol won't allow them to live the way they wish.. it's heartbreaking and exciting all at the same time. Catching Fire is a quick fun read and I didn't hesitate to buy the final book Mockingjay. Thank you Suzanne Collins for an adventurous trilogy.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I gave this to my brother as a christmas gift and he LOVED it! It was a good price too!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn delivers again!  Great action and suspense.  Mitch Rapp is in my opinion the most exciting and bad ass hero out there.

B0079XNWQA|2.0|Given the creativity and diversity of We Sing We Dance We Steal Things, I was really excited about this album.  Unfortunately, Mraz seems to have settled on a single, pop-music bland sound for this album.  Every time I listen to the songs on this album I am more disappointed.  Not to say there is anything wrong with his technique or talent, but if you liked the other album, don't expect the same thing from this album.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really don't like to read but this book was excellent totally worth the money you need to buy this book

B003SWU9R6|4.0|I have always found Marshall Mathers/Slim Shady/Eminem to be a fantastic artist.  His lyrics can be hilarious, shocking and sad (sometimes at the same time). He's gone through a lot in his personal life, and it's interesting that he puts everything out there for us all to hear.  Several great songs here (&#34;Talkin' 2 Myself&#34; is the most memorable) with nary a bad one.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|The aspect of writing it from the dog's point of view was enjoyable. I thought it was a good heartfelt and warming story,  but not great.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book! A great read,especially if you are a dog lover.<br />I can't remember the last time I felt as much emotion over a book as I did when reading  this one!
B0058DRUV6|2.0|While the content of the book is what it is, all of the tables and graphics were shrunk to near-illedgible making many of the consolidation of the points in this book difficult to read.<br /><br />My advice is to get a hard copy, as this book didn't make the coversion to E-reading well.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|The songs that have been released as singles are all fantastic, but the other songs that fill this album are sort of meh...  &#34;Americano&#34; is the one track unreleased as a single that I'd recommend you buy separately, but otherwise just buy the songs you like rather than the whole album.
B000059TCE|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my four year old. Both he and my two year old love both of the DVDs. It really brings the animated classic to life with a few new twists along the way.

B004WMKSH2|4.0|I finally finished the last Harry Potter book and decided to watch the movies. This one was great, but the video quality wasn't the best. There were places that the video lagged and one time it shut off completely. It could have been the new Roku, but it's set up next to the Linksys! In any case, can't wait for the next movie!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Storyline was believeable, acting was good, direction was good.  Enjoyed the scenery. Clint Eastwood was extremely believable in playing the part of an ageing person with problems.

B000YAA68C|5.0|Yes, I guess this would be considered a chick flick, but a very good one. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys feel good movies. Gerard Butler at his finest as well as the rest of the cast.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter world is captivating fiction with a huge  dose of factual information.  I have now followed the characters through 2 enormous volumes and cannot wait for number three.  I also probably learned more about the lead up to WWII than I did in college.

B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Brave is really great.  It's not the pinnacle of Pixar's catalogue, by far, but it's a solid film with memorable characters and a lot to say about family, community, tradition, and individuality.  Well worth your time.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Yes, it's a chick flick. It has a strong cast of characters & is entertaining. It's another feel good movie, so if you need a lift this is the movie for you.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|Kids like it, but normally they'll watch a movie that they like OVER, & OVER & OVER until mommy says &#34;time to pick another movie!&#34; This movie they watched 1x & didn't ask to rewatch it = good for mommy, but surprising. They watched it again 1x a week later & now it's just collecting dust. I'm surprised because they loved Horton Hears a Who, probably watched it 50x in the first year, but this one is not as big of a hit with my 7 yr olds anyways!
B000XT1P3E|5.0|Julia Roberts never lets you down in these two great movies. Notting Hill is always a &#34;feel-Good&#34; movie. Erin Brokovich is good too!

He was a faithful watcher & purchased the DVDs to be able to rewatch all the excitement! He lent the DVDs to us thinking we might also enjoy &#34;Chuck&#34; & he was right, we loved it! So our family was excited to purchase seasons 4 & 5 for Christmas this year & we've been having &#34;Chuck-a-thons&#34; ever since! It's addictive & we love to find out what happens next in the storyline.

0374214913|2.0|Being a bibliophile, the title of this book intrigued me right from the start, and the dust jacket only intrigued me further.  A 24-hour bookstore with a quirky owner and quirkier cliente?  Hints that there might be more to this strange little shop than meets the eye?  I was hooked, and I sat down expecting to be entertained by a light modern fantasy with a book-lover's twist.<br /><br />Maybe I went in expecting too much, but this book fell rather short of my expectations, and rapidly became boring.<br /><br />The book is narrated, in present tense, by Clay, an out-of-work webpage designer who, desperate for work, lands a job working the night shift at the titular bookstore.  The proprieter, Mr. Penumbra, is an odd but kindly little man, and most of his \\"customers\\" are an even stranger lot -- they don't buy, but come in to check out strange and obscure titles according to some system only Mr. Penumbra seems to know.  Clay wonders what's going on, and with some help from his girlfriend, a tech-head Google employee, and his roommate, an artist with aspirations to become an ILM special effects engineer, they set out to solve the mystery of this store.  What they find is an ancient conspiracy, a brotherhood of dedicated readers with cult-like beliefs and ambitions, and a clash between the old-fashioned and the modern that certain people take very seriously.<br /><br />I went into this book expecting fantasy, but \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" reads more like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" without the suspense.  There is no thrill to be had from this book -- the characters are operating under no timeline, and there seems to be no pressure for them to hurry with their quest to solve the mystery.  I don't expect every book I read to be a fast-paced thrill-fest -- some of my favorite books are leisurely in their pace -- but I like there to be SOME motivation to solve the mystery besides \\"oh, it's a mystery, let's solve it.\\"<br /><br />The characters are quirky and likable enough, but main character Clay is a bland everyman without much to define him, a cardboard cutout wandering through a host of more interesting characters.  The character that serves as this book's villain, too, seems lifeless and without motivation -- he has no reason to go against what Clay and his friends are trying to do except for sheer stubbornness, refusing to use modern technology to solve the riddle because \\"we're supposed to use the old ways.\\"  Now this could have made for some interesting character exploration, an intriguing \\"old vs. new\\" argument, but the author avoids that.<br /><br />That's another issue this book seems to have -- it can't decide where it stands on the \\"old vs. new\\" issue.  On one hand, we have the tech-head girlfriend praising modern technology, and on the other hand, we have Mr. Penumbra bemoaning the death of the physical book at the hands of e-readers and computers.  Robin Sloan could have picked one side or the other to support, or even gone with the \\"both sides have their pros and cons\\" standpoint, but he just waffles throughout the book.<br /><br />This book also tries to grapple with much weightier issues than it can handle.  The concept of immortality and resurrection is an intriguing one, one that countless authors have tried to explore, but Robin Sloan's attempts to discuss and explore it come off as weak and clunky.  It's like he suddenly decided he wanted to write a philosophical novel, but couldn't figure out how to make it blend with the rest of the book.<br /><br />I really tried to like this book, but in the end, it became boring, clunky, and uninteresting, and I quit reading two-thirds of the way through.  It was rather less than I was expecting, and I couldn't justify investing more time into it if it wasn't interesting.  I feel like what could have been a fun and delightful realistic-fantasy was instead a watered-down literary \\"Da Vinci Code\\" clone.but main character Clay is a bland everyman without much to define him, a cardboard cutout wandering through a host of more interesting characters.

0440237688|5.0|Very fast delivery like always with Amazon.  My 10 year old had to read it for school and I wanted to read it too.  Very nice book, but a little hard (difficult) to read for a 10 year old (therefore it needed a little adult supervision and explanation), otherwise a very good book!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Have worn out my first dvd needed another...The story moves me and my children and grandchildren love it !!! Will watch it over and over .... Timeless !!
B009AMANBA|3.0|Now if you haven't seen the movie then please don't read this review as it will ruin the film for you.<br /><br />The lead character dies in the end.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Me and my little bro love this game. It is challenging and fun. It is a fantastic time killer and game. Totally love, LOVE this app. Five stars.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great series to have on hand.  A series that will be watched over and over again.  Whole family enjoys this set.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this app!  Its a mind challenge and gives an adrenalin surge! There is casual play for a quick game, normal where the world is just like it is, and brutal where its crazy hard but the rush when you beat it is rewarding. Be sure to infect EVERYWHERE because if there are only dead and healthy people left you lose. Unlocking new disease types and gene codes makes it so playing never gets boring. Ever more fun if you feel powerless sometimes because it gives you a sense of power! I recommend buying this app its worth more than $0.99. And so you know this isn't from the company, I LIKE PICKLES AND UNICORN'S! (Its ok to be paranoid :p)
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I found this game entertaining and the graphics were well viwed on the Fire HD.I would recommend this game. Worth the 5 bucks.
B00APHLLCY|4.0|It was a complete surprise that the band would be releasing a video for a song that's 11 years old, but when I found out there were two videos, I was excited it. MHB was always one of my favourite Rammstein songs because it's really what Rammstein are about in one package. It's creepy and sinister yet feels really epic and keeps your attention from the first second to last.<br /><br />But this single is a different version of the song. It's a slowed down, torch version of their finest song, and among hearing &#34;piano version&#34;, you'd think they are just trying to make a quick buck. Maybe they are, I don't know... But that aside, the piano version is a nice touch. Till's voice sounds both so beautiful and creepy at the same time. And the video is even better... Till with a dress and joker-esque makeup delivering an operatic style performance of his new version of a classic.<br /><br />Is till trying to tell us that his time to quit music is near? At the end of the video, he goes into a t-shaped hole and the light fades, with a poof of smoke emitting from the hole. Well, we don't blame you, our hearts burn that you may be quitting music soon too.<br /><br />Side B, &#34;Gib Mir Dein Augen&#34; (Give me your eyes) is classic Rammstein, a straightforward heavy tune with catchy melodies and creepy lyrics about a man with hideous health, needing every part in his body replaced. Surely, you won't be disappointed and you'll be singing along within repeat listens.<br /><br />Is this essential? Admittedly not, and neither was the need to do a piano version of one of your classics, But nonetheless it's worth owning if you're a fan, and you will not be disappointed. By all means, be sure to get this single!
B007SPN5MA|5.0|I feel this music in my bones. Great for reflection. Some excellent new interpretations of what feels like very very old notions and feelings.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|What the heck !!??  sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.  What irritates me is Xbox!<br />After all this time why can't Xbox fix the tracking and zoom issues!  These items are not small change.<br />Bloody ridiculous!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great episode, cant wait for the second half of this season to begin again! Love the show so much thxs
B009IAIC5I|1.0|Please keep in mind that Iron Maiden are my favourite band ever when reading this review.<br /><br />It's bad enough that Maiden can't seem to be able to go a year or two without releasing a compilation of all their best material, but i didn't see THIS coming at all. Yes, it's great that for once, we have a remaster of the classics coming straight from the original master tapes, but that's immediately corrupted by them being picture discs. It's almost as if all the artwork and fancy design is the point, and the album itself is an afterthought.<br /><br />I have the original NOTB picture disc, and the original Harvest Records vinyl, and the picture disc is just unlistenable. It sounds just like the painful to listen to 1998 remaster, if maybe even worse. In fact, this pic disc sounds slightly better than the original pic disc\\" Thankfully they didn't make the pivotal mistake of including Total Eclipse (one of only two Maiden songs I don't like), but problem is, this is just a bare improvement upon the original pic disc, and it ain't flattering.<br /><br />Maiden's pic disc releases, in terms of sound, are hit and miss- Rock in Rio, DOTR, Flight 666, the compilations,  and The Final Frontier sound great! But everything else in the post 2000 catalog sounds awful on pic disc (especially AMOLAD- on CD it's one of the most handsome and brilliant sounding albums I've ever heard, on pic disc it sounds like Vlado Meller mastered it). And be it no surprise that this sounds... well, as expected, miss!<br /><br />Look Rod, I love you and all, and I appreciate your trying to rectify the awfulness of the 1998 remasters. Even the 1987 discs, which obviously sound better, still have a small and slightly noticeable level of compression (they still have lots of dynamic range), but please give us CDs taken from the master tapes if you want to rectify the problem! Sure these discs sound better than the post 2000 catalog and the 1998 remasters but just barely, and the dynamic range is almost gone because of it.<br /><br />Though I will say, thankfully we will be getting Maiden England this year finally after a 16 year wait on DVD and blu-ray, as Arry recently confirmed in a German iterview, and Arry is trying to reinstate the encores too. Let's hope, at least.most gone because of it.<br /><br />Though I will say, thankfully we will be getting Maiden England this year finally after a 16 year wait on DVD and blu-ray, as Arry recently confirmed in a German iterview, and Arry is trying to reinstate the encores too.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is one of my favorites.  I love all the twists and turns in this book but in the end all of the questions you have are answered.  Colleen is one of my favorite authors!
0345803485|1.0|Cut and paste, cut and paste. Storyline with less drama than an episode of Tracey Beaker. This book could have been written by a 13 year old virgin who accidentally stumbled upon her mum's adult catalogue. This girl failed her GCSE English and as revenge on her teacher she published her fantasy diary when she got older - just to prove a point.<br /><br />I kept going with the whole trilogy because I did not think that so many of my friends could be so deluded. It would appear that they are - or that actually they really hate me. Either way, it is going to be years before I can forgive them.<br /><br />I would recommend that you wait for the film to be on TV and then watch it on fast forward.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I bought this movie strictly for the 3D effects since I already have the Special Collector's Edition. The 3D effects are much better than most other 3D Blu-rays I've seen (I have Cars 2, The Avengers, Captain America). I've been extremely disappointed so far with all the so-called 3D Blu-rays. They are mostly 2D to 3D convertibles and so the effects are not very pronounced. In these cases it's better to save your money and go for the regular Blu-ray, instead of the 3D version. It just a dirty trick the studios are using to charge extra for 3D Blu-rays.<br /><br />Avatar was originally shot in 3D, so naturally their 3D effects are much better. However, if you were to use IMAX 3D Blu-rays (the ones that most Electronics stores use to showcase their 3D TV sets) as a standard, then this Avatar 3D Blu-ray comes up a bit short. Not by much, but still short. For this reason, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's much better than most 3D Blu-rays out there, but still doesn't quite compare to the 3D IMAX Blu-rays.<br /><br />As a side note, if you like 3D Blu-rays, check out Jet Li's Flying Swords of Dragon Gate. The same guy that did the 3D effects on Avatar also worked on this movie. IMHO I think he did a better job on this movie than Avatar.
B000B589JI|5.0|This is a brilliantly simple item that does not leak or allow evaporation.  I am getting one for every member of my family to keep in their 72 hour back pack with a zippo lighter.  Instant heat and fire on hand.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but found this book to be a delightful surprise. I couldn't put it down. It is pure fantasy, with just enough \\"what if\\". I hope it will be the first in a long series. I will certainly buy them all.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Stars<br />Fun, fast game with many levels.  Easy to learn. Time goes by fast when playing this addictive game.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I use this app on my iPad, iPhone & iTouch, so I know it works.  I transfer a lot of pictures between devices & computer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and can't wait to start the next.<br />This one tops my list as of late.
B004FOA84A|5.0|It was a fun game , I'm hoping there will be a sequel soon . Maybe some kind of Time Travel ...
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is pretty cool for time unused at appointment waiting rooms or to kill 10 minutes here and there.  It is not a game one (at least not me) can sit at for an hour or two.  The goals are achievable - the payouts a little low - making the game purchases (characters, etc) a bit of time to obtain.  The lack of last star from me is due to fact that purchasing the new characters adds nothing.  It seems silly to offer characters for purchase and have them do same thing our original game start dude did / does.  The only impetus for getting the expensive characters is for an achieve badge.  Which is really not incentive enough for me.  So, great little time waster /filler - but not really compelling me toward gaming addiction.  Though, I can see how it would be for many.<br /><br />Christine
B0086700CM|4.0|One of the better games available on Kindle, Good game and graphics, lags a bit sometimes on my Kindle Fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read all three books.  I was captivated, and wanted to learn more about the characters. I would recommend a mature audience!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is needed for all teenagers to use to stay connected with all the other friends that they have. Works fine.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Out of the worst of contexts, Viktor Frankl speaks the wisdom of how to live within suffering and find meaning. Staying present to the reality of what is happening right now and finding a glimmer of something that calls us forward seem to be the keys. Dwelling only on what has been lost or is being lost leads to meaninglessness and to a despair. This lose of all hope was certain death in the camps. Reading this book again continues to inspire me to manage my suffering in a way which gives my life meaning and purpose. I highly recommend this book for anyone for whom suffering is an issue.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Another good novel in Abercrombie's own style and own setting with his own cynical sense of humour. An unusual happy end, though.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|The DVDs themselves are excellent, but the packaging is a bit problematic. Discs are packed too tightly, causing scratches when you remove them. Over time it may ruin the discs. After a couple of years, be prepared to buff all of your discs. Aside from that, they are organized very well and the case even has a handle and magnetic clasp to keep it closed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find myself needing this app quite a bit. Its simple and easy to use. Best of all its a free app! You cant go wrong with it. If you need a calculator but don't want to spend money this is the app to get.
B008M721MS|1.0|Logged in fine but cannot use it as I don' t seem to be actually logged in - it says all my contacts are offline and noone can see me on it. Have looked online for help but not found anything. I live abroad so this is one thing I really wanted from my Kindle Fire - To skype family back home without having to turn my computer on.
B007M45PMU|2.0|I was really disappointed in this. It is just boring. Nothing new to hear here. So many bands do the same thing, but better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!!! I tell everyone they need to read this trilogy. I had to read the book numerous times and each time I figure out something I missed the previous time. I will be reading again.

0316069434|5.0|Connelly has another great read in this latest Bosch compendim. You get a taste of a younger Harry, still utilizing skills acquired in the jungles of Vietnam. As well as the older Harry, still coming to grips with raising a teenaged daughter. Both are meshrd well to solve a cold case, done only as Harry Bosch can do it. This is a must read for lovers of this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts out very simple. A two year old could play it. As you progress through the levels, it becomes difficult. There are three free hints available. After that you have to buy hints. I actually like that idea. Yes, I did buy five more hints but will only use them once I am stumped by the game. This game is a very enjoyable pass time.
1401937268|5.0|I have found these cards to be quite beautiful to work with. The colours and the artwork are lovely. The themes that are presented are easy to understand. I enjoy using them, and would consider purchasing another deck of cards by Doreen Virtue for clarification on more specific areas of my life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great read, couldn't put it down. The whole series was wonderful. An unexpected, yet well played crash of an ending.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been a Jon Schmidt fan for over 10 years and am very pleased with The Piano Guys.  I love their CD and especially love their youtube videos.  Cello song is by far my favorite...brilliant and very calming.  Amazing musicians!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|addicting and good brain exercise.  Would recommend for aging parents easy for the less than computer savvy adult would recommend
1419702238|5.0|My son loves this series. I bought it just to keep him reading. He loves the fact that this chapter book is also like a comic book. It keeps him involved in the story and details. Thanks
B001EOQWF8|5.0|My girlfriend actually told me to watch this movie because she was so surprised that me, being a hopeless romantic and cutesy fanatic, haven't seen this movie yet. I thought this movie was adorable. There's not much talking, but there is a great lesson taught and the overall movie is very heartwarming. I love it and would greatly recommend this movie.
B001N4RORE|1.0|I saw the stage show three times and enjoyed it more each time I saw it, but I thought &#34;Mama Mia&#34; lost a great deal in its translation to the screen.  I found it to be trying way too hard to be young and energetic, and ended up being merely frenetic.  The movie will fade into oblivion, I think, which is too bad, because there were wonderful actors in it--although horribly miscast.
B0076DELIG|2.0|It's hard to believe Michael Connelly wrote this book. It doesn't get interesting until more than half way thru and then you are really stretched with Harry's actions as a police officer. I pre-ordered for my Kindle and paid $14.99, now it's available on Kindle for $8.28. I won't be pre-ordering anymore, I'll wait till the price goes right. What else can I say, for a Michael Connelly book, especially Harry Bosch, it was a disappointing read.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It is totally awesome, witty. I sang along the entire movie. My sister and I have watched it at least 20 times
B002ZB26AO|5.0|In depth, well written account of what truly occurs between north and south Korea's.  Enlightening read into true communist culture.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|A decent renter - the animation is excellent as is the voice work.  The story's a bit of a stretch but great for the cost.  Kids loved it.
0007152590|5.0|The product was in very good condition, just like new. I am very satisfied with the purchase. I would recommend it to all my friends.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Another example of Rick Riordan's amazing genius! Totally love the series! Heroes of Olympus is a fantastic continuation of it too! Go Percy!
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie...worth to check out if you like science fiction or action films.  Nothing out of this world but good fun...
B009FBX5M0|5.0|This is good music to work by or workout to. I was impressed with the tunes in the movie and will miss David Arnold's compositions to the Bond movies as I have also missed John Barry. David has said he would do it again if asked and that would be a cool return.<br /><br />Anyhow, good music from the movie makes me want to see it again.<br /><br />Package came quickly. Very good.

0061122416|4.0|Hello,<br /><br />  I was given this book from a friend. He thought it would be a tool to continue to help me find myself.  I had no idea what it was about. I very much enjoyed the book. \\"The Alchemist\\" by Paulo Coelho. Its a book about wisdom, heart and mainly self. Everyone would take something different from the book. It depends on their view of the world and people. It is a good read. It is simple writing and a smaller book. Its full of big information.  The characters are not very deep since the book is smaller. The characters can make you smile though. Its a change from the normal psychology books I read. I have taken a few lessons from the book. You may or may not. I suggest it, you just have to be open to the words. Have fun. :D<br /><br />Thanks for listening,<br /><br />Sarah
B008WCP2KG|2.0|OK, so I am old and not with it.  I thought this was a 'dancing' movie, yes, guys, I'm not dead yet.  But too much stupid story, not enough dancing.  If the story was better....never mind, still not enough performing.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|It is absolutely stunning. What I really expected. It is nicely presented and I highly recommend it to any Beatles' fans.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I hate the way this book ends.  It's just not believable!  As a matter of fact, the last 2 chapters killed this book for me.  I kept reading thinking the book would get better, but obviously it didn't.  Saying I was disappointed is an understatement.  I want the $12.99 back that I paid for the download along with the day it took me to read it!  I know that it will never happen, so save yourself the money and time.  This book is not worth it!
0062103377|4.0|it sounds just like bobby, it had me cracking up the whole time. If anything i wish it was longer
B003VR5PPY|5.0|In \\"9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors,\\" you take on the role of Junpei, who wakes up on a ship after being abducted by a strange figure known as \\"Zero\\" along with 8 other people who are given 9 hours to escape by solving puzzles through 9 possible doors.  It's a premise similar to some of the Saw or Cube movies, though based around puzzles in the rooms rather than traps.  This is not to say there is no danger, though.  Without spoiling anything, there are some very gruesome descriptions and an atmosphere of mystery and dread hangs over the whole game.  The story and dialogue are definitely adult-themed.  The gameplay is point and click where you search rooms to find objects to solve puzzles.  None of these are terribly difficult, but they are fun enough.  You are not actually timed, either.  The 9 hour limit is entirely a story point with no bearing on the game.<br /><br />The real draw to this game is the story and all of the twists and endings.  Depending on which doors you go through you will end up with a different ending.  You cannot get the true ending without seeing a certain ending first.  This might sound annoying, but it is actually masterful the it ties into the plot, and you get new bits of information and character development from the characters when you choose different rooms each time through.  To accommodate multiple playthroughs, the game allows you to fast forward through the dialogue you have already seen on new playthroughs, though you cannot completely skip it.  All of the endings are interesting, and it as advised that you go for the bad endings before the two main endings to preserve their mystery.  One of the endings is simply the \\"true\\" ending cut off with a \\"to be continued\\" if you haven't seen the requisite ending, so you can skip that one.  Also be advised that the true ending is the only one that requires you to answer certain questions in specific ways.  It is advised to look up an ending flowchart to avoid frustration and unnecessary playthroughs.  Without this foreknowledge there is a small amount of tedium in replays, which is why I knock off a star in \\"fun.\\"  The true ending is definitely worth going for.  It adds a ton of story content with twists and answered questions as well as a few more puzzle rooms.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great story with shocking plot twists, then 999 is definitely recommended.
B005LAII0I|4.0|There are few movies that are as entertaining that hold a high enough standard for wholesome family viewing.  Often times the ratings will still contain inappropriate language and situations for a PG rating.  This movie is PG and appropriate for viewers of all ages.
6305428352|5.0|The dvd arrived promptly, as promised. I am pleased and have not issues. Have wanted to purchase this for some time and am glad to get it.
0525425764|4.0|I know these books were written for a younger audience, but I think any adult would enjoy them.  John Grisham books are always worthwhile and this series is a lot of fun.
0316228532|2.0|I really liked the Harry Potter series, which had many, many characters. However, this book starts out with so many different families and relationships that I had to stop and think each time a new character was introduced. It didn't help that many characters had nicknames. One paragraph had the given name, the next a nickname. I had trouble keeping track of all the characters throughout the book.<br />I really wanted to like the story, but it just didn't appeal to me as a whole.
1416549447|5.0|This is an excellent reference book that every runner, beginner or veteran needs to read. I keep it my bedside and constantly go back to read skipping through the chapters.
B000ARFNNM|1.0|The dvd arrived in appropriate time frame from PB (???)  It would not play.  I wrote email to PB and they explained it was a &#34;Region 2&#34; dvd as stated in their ad.  I do not know what that means and would not have known even if I read it.  They were kind enough to give me an address to return the dvd, which I did, for a refund.  I am waiting for the refund.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Well This version is just the same as the free version! What the heck?! My I-phone has the free version and the full version. But on the phone in the free version you have to unlock blades and backgrounds but in the full version you should automatically have all of the blades and backgrounds. Save your dollar. This app is horrible!
B0091REZMW|4.0|if you're looking for a hidden picture game with a little more to it than I would give mystery manor a try. It takes basic hidden picture game elements such as different &quot;types&quot; of rooms (like dark rooms where you need a flashlight and such) and throws a little rpg elements into it (like quests and &quot;fighting&quot; monsters). The only reason I can't give this game a five star is due to the fact that its a typical facebook style game where if you want to move forward with the story at a decent pace you need friends to help you and make micro transactions where you use real money to purchase in game currency. But overall a good game and a good concept.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I actually bought this book for my 90 year old mum as I thought she would enjoy it being set partly in the war era, I read the first few pages & immediately ordered it for myself on my kindle.  I couldn't put the book down, my kindle went everywhere with me!!!<br /><br />The book grabs from the first few pages & the pace never drops with a fabulous twist at the end. Love it & am now going to buy the other Laura Morton books love her style of writing.
B004AQR29C|4.0|The movie was very action packed! A lot of fighting. Not good for young children due to bloody fighting. Good movie though!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I'm currently addicted to building my base. It is frustrating when things you purchase and are in the process of building, disappear for no apparent reason. I could also use a little more help in figuring out how to battle and how to obtain some of the credits. Otherwise its a good game.
B00168OIP8|5.0|DVD was reasonably priced and it was exactly as advertised on line. The item shipped fast. I had a good experience with this retailer.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|\\"Overexposed\\" is the newest flavor from Maroon 5, famously known for their meaningful lyrics and beautiful melodies. Adam Levine has a truly amazing voice and as such sounds good singing just about anything. However, a few of the songs are a bit overtly sexual for my personal tastes, but the album as a whole is simply breathtaking. Personal favorites are of course \\"Payphone\\", \\"One More Night\\", \\"Daylight\\", and \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" among others. I just bought the album today and have already listened to every song on the album (some more than once) and I think that it's safe to say that I look forward to more music from Maroon 5 in the future.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|A remarkable story that is well done and impeccably written. Beginning is a little slow, and it is not initially clear that the author is jumping between the story itself and his experience interviewing Mr. Patel. I highly recommend this book.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I had  been waiting awhile to see this movie. Ordered it so my mom and I could watch it during a girls weekend coming up. Really fast service and great value.
B002OSXDAU|1.0|Yup, I still can't stand Ayn Rand. I thought that I had, perhaps, missed something when I read this as a teenager...not so. Her characters are one dimensional and all behave ( hero or villain) in superlative. Sexist, classist, simplistic and repetitious. I tried...I still couldn't finish. Blech.

006198969X|5.0|Lauren Conrad keeps is classy with this book! She is never revealing and dresses like a lady. Especially loved the section on packing for vacations (I over pack constantly). Only thing I have to complain about is the average woman/girl would not be able to afford most of what she is wearing or showcasing in the book.

0316228532|2.0|I wanted to like this book.  Really.  I guess I should have known better when copies of the hardcover started appearing in the \\"New\\" bin at Half-Priced Books.  Let's face it, the magic isn't here.<br /><br />First, I think it needs to be said that any author who decides to write an adult book has an extra high hurdle in front of them - people expect a lot.  But it was hard to read some of this stuff and ignore the fact that it was written by the same author who wrote Harry Potter.  Yeah, I know, apples and oranges.  Second, like many people have noted, this book has too many characters and a skimpy plot.  To be honest, I'm not really sure what I read and by the last 100 pages I just wanted to be done with it.<br /><br />I know her charity is the Lumos Organization, which assists underprivileged children because it was all over the dust jacket.  I don't doubt that the is a worthy organization.  But I was left with the feeling that the purpose of this book is show the need for donations to the Lumos Organization.  Unfortunately, the only thing I felt like doing after reading it was taking a shower to wash off the slime.<br /><br />Better luck next time, JKR.  My copy is going in my HPB bag for resale.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|For those of us that remember the original 'Forsyte Saga' and 'Upstairs Downstairs', 'Downton Abbey' is a so-so programme.  It is hardly filled with great acting - obviously sets and costumes are 'spot on', but do I really care if Mary and Matthew get together or not?  I am much more interested in the driver and the daughter and whether Mr. Bates get free or not ............. but only up to a point!  We have been driven NUTS here about this show thanks to PBS who have shown it, reshown it and shown it again in order to build up the audience for Series 3, which was aired last night ..... yawn!  So why did I buy this 'special UK version'?  It was a present for someone.

Her wit and humor make the book a real page turner. This is literally a fashion bible and can be used over and over again with the many chapters dedicated to so many areas of fashions even gifts.

0525478817|5.0|\\"You have to read this book, It's amazing!\\"<br />That is the first thing my friend told me about this story, and that is the least you could say about it.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars - What does this title mean to you?  When I started to read this book, I thought the title was catchy. I didn't know what it meant so I was curious to find out. The Fault in Our Stars is about two Indianapolis teenagers who find each other at a cancer support group meeting. Hazel, the smart, beautiful, shy girl is battling terminal thyroid cancer. This makes her very tired and she needs to use an oxygen tank wherever she goes. Augustus, the cute, all around american male teenager, has a fake leg because he had a malignant bone tumor. He wins her heart, and together they start to live a life like they never thought about before.<br /><br />Hazel's favorite novel, An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Van Houten is about a girl with cancer who is still living a good life but the book ends and she doesn't know what happens. Hazel tries to contact Van Houten but she never had any luck. Augustus gets introduced to the book and he ends up getting in contact with him. The author promises to answer any questions about the book if they come to Amsterdam. Augustus uses a \\"Wish\\" he received because of his previous poor health to take Hazel and her mother to Amsterdam.<br /><br />This book starts out a bit slow, but to me it was still very interesting. Something new and/or exciting was always happening in the chapters. The lives of Augustus and Hazel were always changing, I was always waiting for something new to happen to them. There were some things about the science content that i didn't understand. The book was talking about cancer machines, oxygen tanks and different kinds of symptoms. I don't know much about cancer but I looked those words up easily and I knew what was going on. This story is very believeable. John Green did a very good job describing the characters. As the book went along Iwas finding myself picturing what they looked like, where they were, and what they were doing. I was always interested in what was going to happen next, I never ever got bored with it!<br /><br />This science fiction story was presented well. As I said, I don't know a lot about cancer, but this story helped me to understand more about it. I would like to continue to learn more about cancer and the treatments and how they destroy the cancerous cells. To me it was very interesting. In the acknowledgments, Green mentions that the word \\"Phalanxifor\\" was made up. It doesn't exist. Phalaxifor was the drug prescribed for Hazel's cancer. The drug was supposed to slow the cancer cell growth. The disease is treated fictitiously in this novel.<br /><br />Overall this book was amazing. I really liked how things were written and what they meant to the story and to the book. I could really relate to the main character- Hazel. We both think alike, she appreciates the little things in life and so do I. This book deserves 5 stars. I would recommend this book to people 13 years or older. This would be a great book for teenagers who have cancer. The story would show them that you can still be happy and live your life. It would also be great for people who have friends, or parents with cancer. I have read a lot of books but none like this. This book has made me wonder and learn about cancer. It's different and I really like that. The Fault in Our Stars is truly an amazing story.

B003L77FYS|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Castle! It is my favorite show. It has clever humor, mystery, romance....it has everything you could want in a show. I have all the seasons on DVD and would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to be entertained. You will discover this show has a lot to offer.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|What more could I say?  Just another awesome season, the one where we first meet Mike Ehrmantraut.  Walt shows to what lengths he will go to to keep from being exposed.  He didn't actually kill the girl but he stood there and did nothing while she died.  At the same time, he seemed to be trying to decide what to do while watching her OD and stop breathing.  Right up to the end we weren't sure if he would raise the alarm and get her medical help or just let her die.  It wasn't his fault because after all it was just a coincidence he was even there at the time she did OD.  On the other hand, just about anyone else would have called 911 instead of allowing a young woman to die right in front of them, so it was pretty cold.  After this season I just couldn't wait to watch 3.
0395389496|5.0|This has always been a family tradition since before the movie was made. Wonderful book with breathtaking illustrations. My daughter and I love reading this book together.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|it was good and the plot was almost like the original movie.  I did not like that they cut some scenes from the original and I understand that is a budget thing, but they could at least made it a little more exicting/dificult the discovery of the stronghold.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I had never played Angry Birds before buying my Kindle Fire so when I saw the free Angry Birds app I had to download it! The levels are entertaining and gradually more challenging. I would recommend for adults or kids to play!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|We bought this for our older iPod interface in out Honda Minivan.  it would play the older iPods without issue, but the newer Nano and Touch would have weird problems (aside from no charging capability).  The skip to next track would often fast forward instead and other weirdness.  The fact it does the charging too is great.  I have had no problems with buzzing or anything else, it's worked perfectly thus far.
B005LAJ1PE|2.0|This erratic hyperactive logic-free and downright pompous piece of trash wasted a lot more of my life than a 90-minute direct to DVD stinker.<br /><br />Sure, we were baited in with tantalizing teases of graphic violence, kinky violent sex and five shots of Dylan McDermott`s naked hiney in the first episode alone!<br /><br />But in the end, we got a lot of regurgitated claptrap composed mostly of scenes, music and entire plot lines directly stolen from other film sources.<br /><br />Instead of something truly original, we got something plagiarized and repackaged in a blindly flashy package.<br /><br />Although, now that I think of it...what's more \\"American\\" than that?

0780619587|3.0|Fiction or not, this movie has a deep meaningful lesson.<br />Australian concert pianist David Helfgott (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush) defies his father by going off to London to study music. The movie shows how Helfgott's father, a survivor of the Holocaust, continuously programmed his son's SUBCONSCIOUS MIND with the belief that the world was unsafe, that if he \\"stood out\\" it might be life threatening, that if he left his family he would never be allowed to come back. His father insisted that he would only be safe if he stayed close to his family. In spite of his father's relentless over bearing pressure, and a passive ineffectual mother, David knew that he was a world class pianist who needed to break from his father to realize his dream.<br /> In a London competition, David Helfgott played the notoriously difficult \\"Third piano Concerto\\" of Rachmaninoff. But there existed a conflict between his CONSCIOUS MIND wanting success and his SUBCONSCIOUS MIND concerned that being visible, being internationally recognized, was life-threatening and a complete abandonment/estrangement from his father. As he labors through the concerto, sweat pouring from his brow, Helfgott's CONSCIOUS MIND fights to stay in control, while his SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, fearful of winning the competition, tries to take control of his body. Helfgott CONSCIOUSLY forces himself to maintain control through the concerto until he plays the last note. He then passes out, overcome by the energy it took to battle his SUBCONSCIOUS programming. For that \\"victory\\" over the subconscious, he pays a high price: When he comes to, he is insane.<br /> Most of us engage in less dramatic battles with our SUBCONSCIOUS mind as we try to undo the programming we received as children, but the PARENTING lessons this movie provides is undeniable - controlling love can have very long-lasting, nasty effects.<br /><br />David's musical genius inspite of his mental state is thoroughly entertaining and fascinating, yet sad.Some reviewers think this is the beauty of the movie (persevering through adversity), and they totally miss the PARENTING message and lesson about the SUBCONSCIOUS MIND.<br /><br />The SUBTLE ASPECTS OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS are very difficult to portray in a two hour movie. I give this movie 3 star for not finding a way to better convey the CONSCIOUS  V. SUBCONSCIOUS dynamics. And the flash backs make it hard to follow the story line. I think I would have been lost without prior knowledge of the story.<br /><br />But Geoffrey Rush received an Oscar for his portrayal of David Helfgott,  and Armin Meuller Stahl plays perfectly as David's overbearing misguided father, making the suffocating family dynamics so palpable you can cut it with a knife.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I have seen countless plays in the last twenty years, but nothing could prepare me for how Les Mis would change my life. I had high expectations for the cinematic version and was not disappointed - I have already seen it three times in theaters! I was very impressed by the singing voices of all of the actors (and yes, even Russell Crowe has grown on me) and have had this soundtrack on repeat since I bought it about a week ago. Yes, it is missing a few songs (most notably \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\"), but I still think it's an amazing collection that is well worth purchasing. The standouts to me are \\"Valjean's Soliloquy\\", \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", and \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\", mainly because they make me think about how exceptional these solos are in the film. My other favorites are \\"At The End of the Day\\", \\"ABC Cafe / Red and Black\\", \\"On My Own\\", and \\"One Day More\\". The songs are inherently very moving, as the lyrics are unbelievably good, but I also think that the actors do them justice and it is hard for me to even get through the soundtrack without shedding a tear. Two thumbs up, all around!
0762445262|5.0|Don't order this thinking you're going to get a serious light.  It's made for a shelf.  It's small, but it does light up.  It won't project on a wall across a room.  If you're looking for a nice little Batman collectable at a decent price, this is it...

B0072GPQNG|5.0|This movie has beautiful cinematography and captures the spirit/sadness of World War I as I would imagine it.<br />Spoiler alert***Knowing that everything (boy heals, horse heals, boy reunited with horse) turns out all right in the end helped me get through some very sad parts in this movie.  You will cry if you have a tender spot in your heart for animals.  If you are buying as a gift for someone else, remember this is not a movie to be taken lightly.  Probably not something to be shown at a child's 10th birthday party.<br />Otherwise, it's great!!

B008NEVPCC|3.0|Those television singing competitions produce a lot of acts, and some of them become popular before we are even aware they were on TV.  Cher Lloyd is one of those that I became a fan of before I even knew she was on Britain's X-Factor.  Her radio hit `Want U Back' was just so much fun and became the anthem of the summer for my household (seriously, no song was sung as much in our car as this one thanks to two little girls who were in love with Cher's every grunt).  Her full album was released quite a while after her single became so popular.  In fact, I kept looking for her album and then I realized it wasn't released.  It's been out for a little while now, but I finally just got around to diving into it.<br /><br />Sadly, the payoff wasn't as big as I wanted it to be.<br /><br />For a ten track album, she takes a serious nosedive at the halfway mark, serving up a pretty solid into and then taking us to mediocre-town.  It's not that this is a bad album, but she gets too predictable and generic, giving us songs with no real depth of personality, which is not what I expected from the girl who gave us `Want U Back'.  Like a mix of Ke$ha and Lily Allen with a splash of Nicki Minaj, Cher Lloyd certainly has the goods to be a big pop star, but if she wants to make good on that promise she needs to give us something a little more colorful next time.  By track 6 I she was starting to get forgettable.<br /><br />`Want U Back' is still classic fun.  `Oath' and `With Ur Love' are beautifully sung ballads.  `End Up Here' closes out the album perfectly fine.  It isn't astonishing and she does come off a tad too Beyonce here, yet it does remind us that Cher has vocal talents.  `Grow Up' shows off commendable rapping skills as she raps alongside Busta Rhymes.  But then we have a slew of poorly realized tracks like the dreadfully dull `Behind the Music' (seriously, why are songs like this made?).  `Swagger Jagger' is just hokey.  `Playa Boi' and `Superhero' are just too amateurish.  They come off sounding like Kids Bop tracks with faux attitude.  `Beautiful People' is just bland.<br /><br />I think that is a big issue with this album.  Cher's `attitude' comes off as forced by the end of the album.  Sure, she has personality, but by the time the album ends her personality feels put on and unauthentic.  I didn't believe her anymore.  She was tarnished, and I really hate that.  Still, I like her, I just think she needs to dig deeper for her sophomore album, otherwise we won't know her name in five years.They come off sounding like Kids Bop tracks with faux attitude.  `Beautiful People' is just bland.<br /><br />I think that is a big issue with this album.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Before buying this book I read a lot of reviews to see if it was going to be good or even see if others thought that it was decent.  Sadly, as I read the reviews I was immediately discouraged about purchasing this book because I was afraid that Suzanne Collins had lost her touch toward the end of the series.  However, despite what other negative reviews have said, I truly enjoyed the final book of The Hunger Games.  Unlike most stories that tell tales of glorified battles and wars that are clearly won with the protagonist becoming a stronger better person at the end; this story leads the reader through the tale of a rebellion and the complete transformation of the protagonist.  It's as if writing this story was suppose to send a message of reality,in the eyes of those who look at war to merely be a matter of victory or defeat, the message is made clear that anyone could be vulnerable during the act of war.  That even the hero's must suffer sometimes.<br />Personally, I really liked this book a lot and I would recommend it to anyone who has already read through the first two books.  I think the story was well told and at the risk of spoiling anything that happens, I'll end my review here.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first purchased this book I wasn't prepared for the subject matter. However, I was drawn into the story immediately. I sensed something was off right away with sky but there were a few surprises that I wasn't expecting. The characters were well developed and I felt a connection to all of them. There were times that I couldn't figure out who was more broken, Sky or Holder, but it all tied together for me at the end so I'm okay with it.<br /><br />This was an incredible book. I would definitely recommend it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Beautiful quality picture and sound.<br /><br />Also, a complete deal at the price.  Many places have just the Dark Knight Rises for 25$ and it was 2$ more for the trilogy.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Extremely disappointed in purchasing this book. The author describes an experience which doesn't adhere or align itself to any biblical foundation. The Bible is where we learn our concepts of God and heaven, angels, good and evil and repercussions from sin. It seems odd when we no longer return to the Bible for understanding and validation. I don't doubt the author experienced some type of extraordinary experience, but perhaps this experience would have been better understood had the good doctor known his Bible verses. 2 Corinthians tells us that Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light in order to deceive people. The author's experience took him to a \\"heaven\\" that is without Jesus Christ. That is a destination that I do not want!
1594487154|5.0|We owe a debt of gratitude to Dan Pink for this meaningful contribution to the literature on what it means to move others. This book appeals to those who make their living in what we traditionally define as sales and the masses who seek to move others to some sort of action in &#34;non-traditional sales&#34;.<br /><br />I was hooked from the beginning and thrilled with the ending. Truly my favorite Dan Pink book yet!<br /><br />I've heard Dan Pink say, &#34;the highest compliment he gives a book is, 'I wish I had written that.'&#34; I wish I had written To Sell Is Human.

I listened to this on youtube by around track 8 I realzed that this band has lost all ability to see what doesn't work. Drums and bass are virtually non existent. There are a handful of better than average songs, but most are below average. A new band trying to release this music would never have even been signed to a recording contract.

B005LLXBYA|3.0|....and there are more in the five cardboard sleeves inside. And, get this, a little mini-poster of it inside with the liner notes on the back of it. Anyway, I have been appreciating a lot of rare disco and have been reassessing the whole thing, listening to it for its funk and soul properties rather than dance music. However, this collection is quite clearly a bunch of re-edits and loop-arounds, made for dancing, that may be rare and unlike anything, but at the same time may have been a contributing factor for disco's ignoble demise. The machine-like quality it creates really, REALLY can take the soul out of disco. Most of these sound closer to `house' rather then disco by the effect it creates along with occasional off-beat. There is little-to-no-vocal performance on these tracks. Oddly, all these tracks are from the 70s but quite frequently the bass sounds like 80s style. I would bet it is dubbed in. I will keep an open mind about this, as the liner notes tell the listener to challenge oneself.  Regardless of anything, there is probably nothing else quite like this in the average disco collection. You may even have to be a real connoisseur to actually `get' this....I am not quite sure I do yet...

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I bought the blu-ray version because I am totally obsessed with Haven at the moment. I have always been a science fiction fan but Haven is not sci-fi like Star Treks or Farscape or etc. It's the supernatural things and most recently it's love story between the characters got me hooked. I think the reason I bought the disc because I can see the episodes again and again for next 10 years, I think.

030758836X|1.0|What a waste of time!  I am so annoyed that not only did I pay money for this book but I spent my time reading it!  I actually thought until about 3/4 of the way through that this would be a good mystery novel.  NO! NO! NO!  It is nothing but a hoax.  The ending is TERRIBLE!  If you read this book, you will be so annoyed with the ending or lack thereof that you will want to scream!  I am thinking the lead character, Amy, might have been based on the sick mindset of the author.  Her plan must have been to fool everyone into thinking they are reading a decent mystery book and then pull the rug right out from under them!  Actually the beginning 1/4 of the book is really, really slow....I almost gave it up and wish now that I had.  Then it picks up in the middle and you think maybe this will be a good mystery.  WRONG!  FOOLED AGAIN!  I rarely write book reviews but I just had to try and save someone else from making the same mistake.  I will never read another novel by this author/psycho  *@#%*!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I'm a Gleek and I'm proud of it baby!  Seriously, this movie had lots of singing, a splash of comedy and a teeny-weeny bit of young romance.  If you are a fan of Glee then you would enjoy Pitch Perfect.

Not only did it come with a Lego Character but it has all of the information you ever wanted to know about the characters that are out there for Lego Star Wars.  The pages are heavy duty and colorful.  The images are very clear and have descriptions for some of the smallest details that you sometimes don't even notice when your kids are playing with them.  The trick now is finding some of the more rare characters in the book.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Have never played Angry Birds before this.... seems pretty much good.<br />lol.. Nothing to compare it to so I like it.  Get stuck on some levels<br />but wouldn't want it too easy either.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Someone told me about this as I had never seen it before. It is now on my yearly must watch Christmas list.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Jewels I can understand.  Birds trying to destroy things, just not fun in my opinion.<br />I'm glad I got the free version.  it was easy to delete...
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Ordered this for a Christmas gift.  My husband loved it, and I do too.  I recommend it.<br /><br />Patty from Missouri
B009E3EY4M|5.0|What a great show? And they were enjoying the performance - despite the media portrayal of animosity among the players. And it was well edited. I am going to cherish this for a long time.<br /><br />And Jason did his dad proud. He nailed Kashmir and did an admirable job on everything else. Guess they don't still use the 'original' drums anymore.<br /><br />Jones/Page/Plant were revetting. This is a must see and must own.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I don't play a lot of games, but this one is relaxing for me after a long day of work. It makes me think but at the same time I don't need to worry about level's and I can start over whenever I want.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The Polar Express is already an amazing story, and it comes to life as a 3D motion picture!  It's become a family classic at my house ~ you'll definitely enjoy it!
0545403359|5.0|Morpurgo tells the journey of a horse in England, befriended and loved by a lonely farm boy, Albert. The boy's father sells the horse, Joey, to the army. Joey then goes to war, WWI, and experiences a wide variety of events and emotions. The entire story is told by the horse, which is a clever way to present it.<br />Although obviously written for a youth, I found myself, an adult, anxiously turning the pages so as to discover what happens next. This is a simple but eloquently told story.
B006FE83U4|4.0|Robert Mulligan directed this movie and kept it faithful to the book, which is always a surprise. It also shows how a wonderful book can fit on the screen like a beautifully hung picture. Gregory Peck's subdued performance underlines the character of Atticus well. Of the kids, Scout stands out. All the acting roles are beautifully done. I possessed VHS/DVD and now the Blu Ray versions. All showing improvement over the other in the home theater. Cannot expect any more enhancements.<br />Worth watching and worth putting on your shelf.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Throughly enjoyed the book, especially the beginning and the ending. A variety of topics covered to make you think. Recommend.
0525952926|5.0|This history lesson is so intimate----It bings back memories to an 80 year old who lived through much of the history,
0385340559|5.0|The devotion to one another, whom have gone to the brink of death together, is the primary jest of Child's novel. Upon hearing of the loss of four of his cohorts to the work of assassins, Jack Reacher and the remainder of his old army team set out to get \\"the bad guys.\\"<br />Child draws us into his story and keeps us glued to each page, rapidly turning them to see what happens next. Each character depiction is colorful and fascinating on their own, but his hero, Reacher, you've got to love. An excellent read.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very easy to dull a knife while using one. Very handy to have a small device that can fit in your pocket available to sharpen any and all blades. Best thing about this product is that it works.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I wanted to learn about the North Korean State, and did not know anything about the camps before reading this book.  The story was compelling and the author added information about the government and its policy of oppression that supplemented the story line of the escape.  It is a real eye opener.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This book was great inside look at Justin's life. I enjoyed reading it and I got to see how he is as a person and not just as celebrity. I'm a belieber and this book just showed me why I am an will always be.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This plot wasn't a big surprise but the book was definitely a very enjoyable read, I would recommend for anyone that needs a good love story :)
0061733199|5.0|Just when you think you know everything. This book is a must have. If you want to be properly informed and prepared this book has got you covered. An easy read as well as very descriptive. Check it out you will not be disappointed.
B006FE83UE|5.0|got here just in tome for movie night, thanks for the speedy service and actually having a movie still wrapped in plastic.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband for Christmas! It arrived quickly and was packaged nicely! He loves it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A must read! Never a dull moment, hopeless keeps you going non stop, you won't want to put the book down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like ALL of John Grisham's books, you ask , will it be made into a movie? I read all of Grishams books. His books are not great<br />literature. His books are quick reads and always interesting stories. I hope this one becomes a movie. I would go see it.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|i was really excited about seeing it. but for the most part it was ho-hum. only the singing bits(and there were ALOT of them)Tom Cruise did were worth watching. did not care for the writhing in the church scene and the strippers needed better choreography. if there was a 1-10 rating i might give it a 7. glad i didnt buy it, afterall. thanks for the option to rent Amazon, you ROCK!!!!!
B00846REIS|3.0|This was a good book but not as good as 50 shades of grey. A lo was the same story line. I will read the others
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I like this movie a lot but feel like most guys won't really dig it, so women use a girls night movie :)
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Easy to install and play, having lots of fun with it! I would recommend it to anyone wanting a nice game
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very easy game to play.  Great fun.  Yes, there are ads, but just click out of them.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|My husband and I really liked this version of the Phillip K. Dick book.  I know it got lousy reviews but I think this version was much closer to the book and i very much enjoyed Colin Farrell in the part.  Good time and worth the rental fee.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not even sure why I love this show but I do! The idea of it seems a little over done, but I guess it is produced/directed well because it totally sucks you in!! Watch it and find out for yourself :) Season 3 re-starts on 2/13/13!
B00902MCVY|5.0|This is some excellent music - all the songs are unusually good - the melodies, the words and the instrumentals are all really special - Land of Snow and Sorrow is one of my favorite songs - Sons of Winter and Stars is also an exceptional song - the 2 long instrumental tracks are also really special
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|Elegant packaging and art.  A true treasure for fans of Japanese cinema, or just excellent film in general.  The person I gifted this to was ecstatic and couldn't stop gloating over the beauty of the box and booklet.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|This was entertaining and the little moral lessons about choosing your friends was well done.  I've always liked these movies and this one was no exception.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I think the idea of this movie was kind of cool, but the execution of it not so much. It was a little hard to follow and once you really understand it the movie is almost over, but to each his/her own right. Not the best but still worth watching.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Seth Mcfarlane does it again.  Only he can offend every imaginable group of people and illustrate so many daily life scenarios in a way that is so entertaining and absolutely hilarious in a single movie.  If you love Family Guy you have to see this, no excuses!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I literally just spent my entire day on my couch reading this entire book. Bravo. I loved it. So much. Highly recommended.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Jeremy Renner, what's not to like!  A bit too much crash and bang at times, very loud, but I really enjoy Jeremy Renner's acting and this was a great way to entertain ourselves for a few hours.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|Not a big fan of Matthew Mcahuanah (however the hell you spell that) in this creepy ass role. The movie was weird to the point of distrubing in some scenes.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This is not just another cheesey vampire movie.  This movie is first rate all the way from the story, dialogue to the choice of actors.<br />This movie will keep you entertained from beginning to end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A good read. If you read the 1st and the 2nd book then you must finish the trilogy! She writes a mean book! It makes you yarn for more.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I've enjoyed the first episode and although I will say I like the BBC version better this isn't bad for a knock off.  The chemistry between the characters will hopefully develop in time and the quirks are good.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|I rented this as a refresher for season 7 when it started. I love Dexter, but no season finale (or season for that matter) will top season 5 (trinity).
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I enjoyed seeing Daniel Radcliffe in this role.  There was no residual Harry Potter as you might expect from an actor that grew up playing the one character.  Awesome story.  Very Haunting,  Not your average ghost story.  I liked it very much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very Graphic and I love the way she uses her words. IT'S A MUST READ! Buy this book now! It will blow your mind
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I've been watching NCIS from the beginning and always enjoy the entertainment.  It's not terribly cerebral but for an hour to veg it's worth it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|love the graphics and sound effects...keeps my son occupied during road trips..can't get enough of angry birds..would definitely recommend to all
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was amazing! I really liked that all the help u needed was right there in the game and that I didn't have exit the game to find a walkthrough when I got stuck. Graphics and storyline were great. I definitely recommend this game and wish there was a sequel available already!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you read this you MUST BUY the next 2 books. The story is great it just goes on and on. I finished this book in 4 days. It great!
B008NF45S2|1.0|This was the highest rated printer app.  I was so disappointed after setting it up though.  The app installed my printer and printed a test page with no problem. But it also wanted to get passwords to other apps so it could print them (email, Facebook, etc), which was fine by me.  But it failed to detect accounts that were already there, the process was unintuitive - and the app repeatedly locked up.  It also doesn't work with OfficeSuite.
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|The story was ok, but I couldn't understand the dialogue.  I'm not sure if it was due to the accents or low gruff voices, but I could only follow about half the dialogue.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Had a surprise ending but that's why I enjoyed it.  Loved the characters and their story.  Thanks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just bo it  ones u pop u can't stop lil one I love this $***  keep up the good work 4 life
B008J05EL8|2.0|Very annoying that after purchasing an app to work with ME Office documents on my Kindle Fire HD, I then find out that I have to pay for these fonts for my documents to look right.  Both apps work fine,but both will be rated low for the bait-and-switch.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Hilariously written. Good plots and interaction between characters. I enjoy this series. Especially on Amazon with no commercials with access to the entire season.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fast moving, exciting, more than I expected. I had no intention of reading this trilogy because I didn't think it was my cup of tea, but I was wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, the characters and the suspense.  I'll be reading it again at a slower pace to pick up what I missed on the first race through these books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I choose the rating of how much I loved the movie and wanted to know the difference between the movie and the book. I liked the part that the English teacher tells Charlie \\"We accept the love we think we deserve\\" I believe in those words so much and I recommend this book to anyone who loves twists in a story. Stephen Chbosky Is one of my favorite writers now
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|The first doc I opened on this was a very basic Word doc from my skydive - it gave me a corrupt file error.  Some other docs seemed to be fine. Then I find out I have to pay more for basic fonts.  Then I find it doesn't work with PrintHand (printing software).<br /><br />Seems like pretty simple issues to fix to get up to 5 stars.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|If you define &#34; your music &#34; as in any way exclusive, this is the one to make you rethink your parameters. If your already there, rock on...
B007SGM084|5.0|I found this trilogy to be a good read!! Of course I had to read them over again! Great book to put on your Kindle when on vacation.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen DrGeneres never fails to make me laugh! She has such an amazing personality and I absolutely love this book.
B00AG51V8E|2.0|I watched The Cold Light of Day thinking that it would be a decent / convincing enough thriller with the cast.  Instead, we have a rather un-intriguing passable action film.  Henry Cavill is a pretty stiff actor.  Bruce Willis doesn't get enough screen time.  And Sigourney Weaver - poor woman - ends up as a 3rd rate baddie with a machine gun.  She's a long way from her Alien Ripley days, and whoever thought she could pull this off convincingly should probably have been shot.  What's next for her?  Stop or my Mom will Shoot the Sequel?!<br /><br />Lots of Henry running around like an NFL running back and getting hurt.  I'm wondering how he will fare as Superman.  A better script would have made this worthwhile!<br /><br />Tough to decide if this should be 2.5 to 3 stars.
B003K07DUC|5.0|Keeps you with it and presents a strong statement. Statement aside, holds its own. Whether you agree or not, you'll be with this one start to finish.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My grandson still plays with this after purchasing it for him last year! It sticks to the fiber glass with no issues and even after a year, it works and keeps his bathtime fun!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting book. Concept of afterlife is somewhat different from others that have been published.  Maybe it will be different for each one of us
1451627289|4.0|What a powerhouse of a story! King really outdoes himself this time, and for such a prolific writer of towering success, that's a very tall challenge, indeed. He weaves a masterful story of time travel that compels the reader to turn each page--all 800 or so of them--until the thrilling and pleasurable finish. He certainly did his research, too, offering the reader just the right balance of historical detail mixed in with thought-provoking fiction. The only hesitation I had in rating this story a 5 was that I thought he weighed down the story between pages 200-400 with some gratuitous subplots and overdone dialogue that sometimes felt forced or meant to slow us down before the main character starts tracking Lee Oswald. On the other hand, perhaps this is the glowing genius that is Mr. King, because he first empowers the reader to plug deeply into the story's multiple layers and dimensions before he draws them into the narrator's primary mission and thrust, and then bulldozes his way to the exciting ending. Don't give up on this monstrous novel, because the eventual payoff is well worth those downshifts during the early to middle chapters. Bravo, Mr. King. I hope Hollywood takes notice and puts this on the screen; I'll be first in line. [[...]], by Michael Stringer
B000DZIGDU|5.0|When the level rises, there's either room to float or the cork will pop. Detailed and graphic about the little things that matter when the Big Picture looms.
B002BWP49C|5.0|My granddaughter loves all things to do with the Twilight series. She said this movie is awesome and would highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled on this book just browsing around on my Kindle. Saw that it has a high rating and was very reasonably priced and thought \\"Why not?\\" Holy smokes what a great find - first and foremost, the author has conceived of a very imaginative world. So many science fiction / apocalypse books are derivative, predictable, and made up of cookie-cutter characters. None of those concerns came true here at all; the books are imaginative, full of lively characters and he manages to construct a whole world in a small space. I came for the price point, stayed for the story.<br /><br />Fair warning to future readers - be prepared to get a bit tired while reading Wool due to the difficulty of putting the book down when you should be sleeping.
1601254679|5.0|The pregenerated NPCs in the back of the Gamemastery Guide were wonderful.  This is a whole book of them!  Some of them are bit weird, but they are probably from the Golarion stuff.  I don't use the Pathfinder setting.<br /><br />Definitely  an invaluable resource!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Having Pinterest on my Kindle makes it much easier to read recipes, and my Kindle stand stays upright and lit for maximum efficiency in the kitchen.
145210655X|5.0|This adorable book features a look at a fatherly Darth Vader, walking his young Luke Skywalker through growing up in a galaxy far far away. The book doesn't contain a central story, and isn't lengthy, but by is no means disappointing.  Its full of nods to the movies and is great for kids and adults. A sequel following Darth and his little princess Leia arrives in April 2013. The quality of the book physically is great too. 100% satisfied
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Having watched the HBO series, I'm sorry to say that, in my opinion, this series of books makes better movies than reading.  I think it's because there's an amazing set of characters and an amazing plot they're working through, but the books are just tedious.<br /><br />The writing is competent, but it's certainly NOT eloquent.  Once you know the story, there's plenty of foreshadowing and wit, but let's be honest, the best thing this man's writing needs is a ruthless editor.  About the 500th time I read that some woman's been raped, some guy's been skewered, etc, I'm tired of the storyline being hijacked by this NOISE!!<br /><br />Eventually, this feels like a fantasy on Prozac.  Structurally it's the same, from its monotonous serial-esque breakdown of chapters by individual characters to its paragraph and sentence structure, which Martin probably bangs out in his sleep (I certainly know why this is the LAST book I read before dozing off)...  And when, after pages and pages of \\"the same old\\", he FINALLY gets our juices going...the chapter ends and the next chapter winds up rupturing the narrative.  Is this man completely incapable of keeping a narrative moving cohesively?<br /><br />And you know what the biggest crime here is?  This is a fantastic set of interesting characters, facing interesting challenges that I think about when I'm not drudging through this sludge.  This isn't just one character making a journey, this is SEVERAL characters making their own journeys!  This seems like unprecedented fantasy fiction!!<br /><br />But, man, Martin sure makes you WORK for it!  I'm starting to think he's asking too much...
B00942S4OY|1.0|We were excited to get this CD for our early Teen daughter because of their upbeat/fun songs from prior albums.  Unfortunately, almost every song on this CD contains innuendo eluding to some sexually related theme.  Before you purchase this album, read the lyrics to the songs.  For example:<br /><br />Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy till we see the sun<br />I know we only met but let's pretend it's love<br />And never, never, never stop for anyone<br />Tonight let's get some<br /><br />Hey girl, it's now or never, it's now or never<br />Don't over-think, just let it go<br />And if we get together, yeah, get together<br />Don't let the pictures leave your phone, ohhhh.<br /><br />Consider if you really want your daughter to listen to song after song of a boys trying to coerce and flatter girls into sexual behavior.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was so happy to see this for such a great price. I was so excited, I let my boyfriend open it before Christmas. We love the movies, so the price was just icing on the cake.
0385535147|2.0|&#34;***indeed a work of fiction, and more so than usual***almost nothing based on reality***research hardly a priority***accuracy not deemed crucial***&#34;.  Grisham also states that &#34;even the laziest of author's need some foundation for their creations***&#34; but that he was &#34;occasionally at a loss.&#34;<br /><br />One has to be a devoted fan or at least a wee bit stupid to buy a book where even the author himself was at a loss as to where he was going with his plot.  Without ruining what plot there was, suffice it to say that Racketeer was written as if it was the lazy result of three different books quickly stitched together as one.  Characters come and go at random.  There are no plot twists--rather the plot aimlessly wanders.<br /><br />As someone else said in another review--if you are a Grisham fan--wait until you can buy this book cheaper, say for $5.  It isn't worth more than that.  Then read the first...and the last...three or four chapters.  There is not much in the middle to hold your interest.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Sci-fi is not a genre I usually am drawn to but after stumbling on Wool Omnibus (I don't even remember how it happened) I decided to give it a shot. I must say, this is good stuff. I was sucked in and couldn't wait for every available minute to read. I spent two days driving from Florida to Tennessee and all I could think about was getting to my destination each night so I could see what was going to happen next! I can easily see this being made in to a movie or even a tv series. Whatever you usually read, you will like this book. I promise. Enjoy ~
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Bought this watch for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. It is dressy enough to wear to the office yet also has a casual look.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but I guess it appeals to very specific tastes. I for one thought that its strength was the fact that it was not just like the book, as I felt the book would not translate well into film if taken literally. The book succeeds because there is enough fact to make the fiction seem somewhat plausible. In the film, however, there is no entertaining way to be faithful to facts; who's going to want to read several paragraphs of information before every scene just to get context? The movie is tasked with keeping the general blueprint of the book, but finding ways to express the same things without the benefit of elaborate backstory. What the film does well is condense the backstory in a way that it gives enough information to make you understand Lincoln's motivations, but it holds enough back to keep up pretty good pacing. If you're watching this because, you want historical accuracy, avoid at all costs. But, if you want an entertaining alternative history, this movie has lots of fun action and pretty satisfying, if over-indulgent, climax.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was fun and enjoyable. Good humor and likeable characters. It was a good children's story with a good lesson. I thought the bear animation was especially well done. The bears moved like real bears.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Loved the movie had to really pay attention to stay with story.  It was a bit different then the other Bourne movies not so predictable.  It kept you on edge .
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Rec as advertised, immediately & well pack. I bought this item as Xmas gift for my grandson.  He like it.  I am very satified.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|The storyline of the second season is just not as captivating as the first season.<br /><br /> I'm unhappy on how the writers had created this story line.
B00026WUBE|4.0|This is one of those albums that you don't get upon first listen. When I saw it in the Public Library fifteen years ago and saw that the Band backed him on it, I was giddy. When I listened to it my first reaction was, \\"What crap.\\" On a Night Like This sounded like fluff. I dug \\"Forever Young\\" and \\"Wedding Song\\" and pretty much wrote off the rest as uninteresting filler.<br /><br />  Man what a few years can do. I rediscovered it on Amazon while filling in the missing gaps in my Dylan catalog and am I ever glad that I did. Like many albums, I wasn't ready for this when I first listened to it. A few years put it in a different light.<br /><br />  There isn't a commercially viable hit on it sans Forever Young, but it has a lot of depth to it both lyrically and musically. I still think that On A Night Like This is outta place. But there really isn't a weak song on it. Even On A Night Like This is a good song, just out of context with the rest of the album.<br /><br />  The Band is outstanding while backing Dylan as always. Garth's keys on Tough Mama kind of remind me of Up On Cripple Creek on with a bite. Robbie's guitar on Going, Going, Gone is spine tingling. Coincidentally, they are two of the album's strongest tracks. Others of note are: Dirge, Wedding Song, Hazel, and You Angel You. The lyrics are well written with many layers. Songs are about love, loss and suicide. Dirge and Going, Going, Gone are definitely darker.<br /><br />  In summary, is this Dylan's best album......No. But don't make the mistake of underestimating it like I did. It is not on par with Hwy 61, Blonde on Blonde, Desire, Blood on the Tracks, and his other best, but it is a great album. I would like to give it 5 stars, but as you can see, I can't get over On A Night Like This. If you do buy it and listen to it several times, you won't be disappointed!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love this game! It worked flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD. The graphics are fantastic, and the story is spooky and just complicated enough.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|Rec as advertised, immediately & well pack. I bought this item as Xmas gift for my grandson.  He like it.  I am very satified.
0452289963|5.0|I have read this book more than once, and learned more with each reading.  I recommend everyone to try reading this, and if it's not for you at this stage of your life put it down and try later.  If it is for you, and you take it to heart, it will be life changing.
B001SF8G1Q|4.0|Has some great tracks, yet lacks the consistency of some of his other classic albums. A must buy for any real Dylan fan!
030758836X|5.0|I just finished Gone Girl and I am still processing it but wow!  Every time I thought I could not be shocked anymore I was.  The writing is superb and the twists and turns will have your mouth hanging open repeatedly.  The story itself is pretty dark but if you are up for it it's a great mystery.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is absolutely hilarious, and this book honestly made me laught until I cried. Definitely recommend reading it :)
B002L4QP0M|5.0|This is a very good book I could not put it down till the end excellent. Mr Archer very good author
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I didn't care for the quips and humor injected into a more serious story. I thought it was out of place.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was so hard to put it down once I started reading.  I could feel the emotions of the characters and what  they were going through as if I was right there with them.  Can't wait for your next book . . . Whatever it is.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The movies were off the chain. I got a Samsung 8000 series and the movies looked so crisp. You can tell every detail.
B0038AL7M4|5.0|I saw this movie in 1968 before Jane Fonda went to Hanoi. I love all of the options that blue ray offers.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Everyone in my Book Club enjoyed this book, and found it well written and interesting. Who knew flowers had so many meanings? The ending was a little weak, but overall a good read.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|The Marware Vibe is a very basic case for a 7\\" Kindle Fire HD.  It's easy to snap the tablet into the four rubberized corners of the rigid frame, making it easy to install or remove.  The Vibe provides a good amount of protection on the front and back of the tablet without adding a lot of undue bulk.  The simple elastic strap closure is effective and keeps the entire unit flat so that you can easily store it on a bookshelf or neatly lay it down.<br /><br />The Vibe lets you prop the tablet up but only in a landscape orientation.  The cover folds all the way back so that you can easily hold the Kindle in one hand while reading.  All of the Kindle's ports are accessible while it's in the case, meaning you can charge it without removing it.<br /><br />However, the cons compared to other cases include<br />* The case cover does not have any magnetic feature to automatically put the tablet to sleep, so you have to completely power it down each time you put it away<br />* The exterior materials are synthetic, and not even the best synthetic I've seen.  Also, the interior lining is the same as the exterior, i.e. not any sort of soft fabric to protect your screen.<br />* When you prop the Kindle up, there are no slots to hold it in place so that over time, it may start slipping around.  Plus, the exterior materials on the back of the hinge puckers up, which could eventually cause it to wear out or even crack.<br /><br />For just a little bit more, I would recommend the Marware Axis instead.  It is made of superior materials inside and out and also facilitates much more flexibility in how it props the Kindle, including rotation between portrait and landscape.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! read it in less than a day. definitely a page turner, i cannot wait to start catching fire.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Shipped very fast and was priced below retail.  I had it shipped to the<br />person as a gift.  The person was happy as it arrived the day of the release<br />and she was able to go on record as having the first copy for a DAY.<br /><br />This site has been used before for pre release buying and arrives at the same time<br />as the retailers get their shipments.
B000007492|3.0|Of the classics I like, they are great...some I just don't recognize. Will probably just load my MP3 player with my favorites.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|No one should ever feel alone. There are people that feel the same exact way as Charlie and this books makes you feel like you are not alone.
B003JRD5JO|5.0|I only got this because I had the cassette in high school and lost it somewhere along the way in twenty-five years.  I still love it.
B0061QD88S|5.0|You dont have to be an animal lover. This is just a great movie. Heart warming and enjoyable. Price was right too, and as always Amazon is right on with their time line.
B000089RV6|3.0|I'm not a fan of AC/DC, my son is, but he really likes the album. As long as he doesn't blast it through the whole house it will be great.
B007R41E8O|5.0|The game took a day and half to download. For that I should give it a 4. But this game has been so fun that I just can't put it down. It is a must.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Es como escuchar nuevas canciones. El sonido está igual y quizás mejor que los remasterizados de 2009. The Beatles siguen sorprendiendo.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|...just read Scott's review. I have nothing to add. I put off reading this book because I knew I'd be a red faced, swollen eyed, slobbing mess at the end of it and I completely was but in the best way possible. I adore John Green and all of the characters he introduces us to, but oh my Jebus, Hazel and Augustus.<br />HAZEL!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />AUGUSTUS!!!!!!!!!<br />ISAAC!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Enjoy this amazing book and let it seep into your veins and make you feel like you have the coolest group of friends this side of the milky way.
0399230033|5.0|Every home with a child should have this book.  We love to point out the little details,  such as the Ernie toy in the cage of one animal.  When we get to the climax,  as the zookeeper's wife wakes up to the sound of the animals in her bedroom, an energetic &#34;Uh-oh!!!&#34;  usually gets participation from the child being read to by the second reading.  We like the board book format best -- stands up to lots of travel and use. A great little gift.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My four year old loves my little ponies and she enjoys this game.  She is learning to read so I have to help but it is great bonding time for us.
B003UN409Q|5.0|I love this movie! It has some beautiful and artistic scenes! In High School I did a report on this movie and got an excellent grade, the teacher thought it was a great unique choice! This is a MUST SEE for every Doors fan!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|PLEASE BUY IT IS A AWESOME READ AND I REALLY LOVE THE BOOK!! Be supporters and be awesome it is great!!
B0053O89WY|5.0|We get the complete season each year -- we are rarely around to watch the series on television.  Laugh-out-loud writing and wonderful ensemble acting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't think I was going to get through the first book, as it didn't seem to have much of a plot until towards the end when it finally hooked me! I couldn't put Fifty Shades Darker down- the sex got better as did the story line, finally the plot thickens in book 2. I'm diving into Fifty Shades Freed as soon as I'm finished with this review!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love the Music. all their music inspires and lifts me up. well worth the cost. am looking forward to a new album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You guys should all buy this book. It is a great e book and works on my ipod and kindle !!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Parents will need their handkerchiefs for this one, especially if they have a kid in high school with college not so far away.<br />Loved the insidious humor (the tag teaming by the toys to deal with the rough treatment by the toddlers!).  The Buzz Lightyear Spanish tango alone is almost worth the price of the DVD and is my favorite part of any of the Toy Story movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first time I have ever felt strongly enough about a book to bother writting a reveiw. This book keeps the reader on their toes, never a dull moment. I'm not ashamed to admit I cried hysterically during multiple scenes. Wonderful book that I definitely recommend.

B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I really don't like this game much.  Maybe if I've played it more often, I could get into it but for now, I just think it's boring.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The one program we bother to watch more than once, we buy the series every year.  Deserves every Emmy it gets....

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We were introduced to Downton Abbey by a friend during the holidays.  We watched seasons 1 & 2 during our vacation and holiday time, and are now hooked.  We watched the extended first episode of season 3 last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am completely addicted to this game! It gets really fun when you're good at it and you're speeding through each level. You don't have to be good at puzzles or anything like that, which makes it an even better and funner game.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|a bit of a slow start, but once it got going keeps me captivated... good read, I highly recommend it!
0345803493|2.0|I thought Fifty Shades Darker, was the same thing over and over. It was like E.L.James was trying to rewrite The Story Of O.<br /><br />o
B00AFEXRME|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought it would be about how quickly the media and public can turn on a real-life hero, as well as the fickleness of our society. However, that's not what \\"Flight\\" is truly about. Not to undermine its wonderful story but it is a simple one. Denzel Washington portrays airline pilot Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic and drug user, who saves many lives aboard his flight when a technical mishap occurs. He's hailed a hero, but it comes up that there was alcohol in his blood after the crash. Now, Whip is trying his best to avoid jail time when an investigation into the crash is conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Along the way, he meets various characters who are there to \\"wake him up\\" to his addiction, but it is up to him to come to the realization. Washington shines as the troubled protagonist (in fact, you might say he's a mirror image to Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland from [[ASIN:B00003CXRP Cast Away (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]). As I said, the film is somewhat simplistic but the performances and direction are amazing -- particularly Washington who simply is Whip, as if he were a real-life person.
1449325947|5.0|I love the Missing Manual books, especially those by David McFarland. I have his CSS book and just received the new CSS3 book.<br /><br />After browsing the new CSS3 book, I realized it is almost exactly the same content as the previous CSS book. Since CSS3 is largely undeveloped at this time, there's very  little about it in either book. Therefore, buy one of the books but not both. Either way, the books are outstanding, well written, have great examples and tutorials, and a must for your technical library.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King is a master story teller and this one does not dissapoint. A thought provoiking read on time. Loved it!
0345803485|3.0|It was okay, it seemed like it was the same thing over and over. It was funny when they met.but after that it seemed i always figured out the next scene.
B005LAII8A|5.0|I've been a big fan of writer/director Rian Johnson since his 2005 debut hit [[ASIN:B000FVQM2Y Brick]] (do yourself a favor and rent it NOW). I even loved his underappreciated sophomore release, 2009's [[ASIN:B002J1RZHE The Brothers Bloom]]. So I was more than excited when I saw he was departing from his usual con-men and brooding characters and delving into the sci-fi realm, full of hitmen, telekinesis, and time travel. Johnson did not disappoint! This ties with \\"Argo\\" and \\"Django Unchained\\" for my favorite film of the year! Every actor -- and their performance -- is top-notch, but what takes precedence here (as it always should) is the story. Johnson writes and directs a story that is not just entertaining but full of meaning and moral quandaries. This film takes the theoretical question of \\"If you traveled back in time to when Adolf Hitler was a little boy, and knowing what he would later do, would you kill him?\\" Only, in this film, there's more sci-fi and twists that make the question not so black-and-white. One of the best sci-fi films I've seen in a LONG time ... with plenty of action, cool special effects, good writing, good acting and a great message. But don't think you know how the entire movie will be just by watching the movie trailer. There's more to this film than you could think!
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers are just plain fun. Music for your soul and your heart. Just try to keep your foot from tapping during Submarines!

B00631VJIC|4.0|I really wanted to see who the artists were. It is good music, but I was suprised to see who was actually singing. Well done.
B001I10ABO|4.0|While the album presents as the same classic it has always been, this vinyl re-issue comes as a single sleeve with two records and a slip with lyrics on it. It would be nice for a classic album like this to get a proper double gatefold re-press one day.
B004LROMWU|5.0|The first season was pretty good.  I ordered it due to cutting out cable and no longer being able to watch the series. The first season is more like getting you set up for the story.  Worth buying if you like this type of movies because Season 2 is even better !!  Wish I had cable so I could watch Season 3 as it happens !!
0205632645|5.0|This is a book that every writer should have. I have it next to my desk and reference it often.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Good game for the kids.  My kids would  probably want to buy this game even if it wasn't free. They play it all the time!
0545265355|4.0|Enjoyed this series of books.  Went through all three books in no time because I couldn't put them down.  Loved watching the Hunger Games movie and look forward to the other two being made into movies.

0307730697|5.0|Fearless is the incredible story of Adam Brown, a fallen member of the elite SEAL Team Six.  Brown's story has highs and lows, times where you'll laugh, and a heart breaking ending as this fearless warrior volunteers one last time to do the impossible task for his team.<br /><br />A Fearless Man<br /><br />Adam Brown was fearless from birth.  The book begins with his childhood and helps you understand the making of a tender warrior.  The stories told about Adam from his youth will leave you laughing and asking \\"Why would someone to do that?\\" as friends describe him jumping out of moving cars while on a bridge because \\"It would have bothered him to not have tried it.\\"<br /><br />  \\"To fail at something was acceptable. To fail to try was not.\\"<br /><br />That quote best summarizes Adam's philosophy of life.  And his life was full of it's share of failures.  After high school, Adam discovered the drug world and spent the next few years of his life in and out of prison.  He betrayed everyone in his family and most of his friends.  His life wasn't in a downward spiral; he had hit the bottom.<br /><br />That's when, out of desperation, he joined the Navy.  He wanted structure, stability, and a challenge.  And that's exactly what he found.<br /><br />A Fearless Warrior<br /><br />The author, Eric Blehm, does a good of job of telling Adam's entire story.  This was Adam's wish so that others would know that no matter how far they had fallen that there was always hope.  Where did Adam's hope come from?  His relationship with Christ, his wife and kids, and his family.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Nearing the end of the book I found myself wishing I had got to meet Adam.  Stories like his demonstrate the power of the gospel.  When you read his \\"dark years\\" you will find yourself wondering how his life will ever get turned around.  When he relapses back into drugs, you'll think the story is over.  But by grace, humility, hard work, and unconditional love Adam's story, thoughended seemingly far too early, is one you will be thankful to have read.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
0399226907|5.0|this was a gift for some friends who are expecting and they really love the old classic and so did we.
068485743X|5.0|I love this book. It has great advice. My writing has improved since reading and studying this book. I keep it nearby for reference.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Well-written, engaging...excellent narrative...action-packed!  I thoroughly enjoy Harkness as a light reading experience.  Nothing too challenging, fairly low reading level.  Good stuff for followers of angels, witches, vampires, etc.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|Leaning so much about each queen that I didn't know before--priceless.  And this book really opened my eyes about Anne Boleyn, and the kind of woman she truly was.  The biographies of these ladies--who they were and the lives they lead--this was so enlightening to read.  If you're currently reading this, consider reading The Children of Henry VIII as well.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson tells the story of Steve Jobs in a way that brings you in to Jobs' world. By the end of the biography, not only do you understand what made Apple great, the reader feels that they know Steve Jobs on a pseudo-personal level.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I am not a huge Eastwood fan, and I figured this was another typical Eastwood movie.  But I was wrong and very surprised.<br />The story is fluid and genuinely enjoyable.  If you haven't seen it, worth a look, you'll be glad you did.

0545265355|5.0|After borrowing my grandaughter's to read I just had to get my own so I can read them over again whenever I like. Anyone who hasn't read this series (or seen the first movie) is truly missing out on something amazing.<br />Suzanne Collins has created interesting characters that keep your attention rivetted. You just can't put the books down until you're finished.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Great CD. Jeff Lynn is better than John Lennon anyday!! I saw  them on VH1 television and had to buy the CD. Waiting for MR Blue Skies to be in stock.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched in 3 times and it was just as funny the third time as it was the first time!
B006FS22Y8|4.0|This was a nice collection of music, but it really would've been great if Amy had made another album on her own.  A few of the songs are really good, but the rest not as much.  She sounded great, but this album makes you really miss her not being here to make another stunner like Back to Black.
1451683405|4.0|A very short book (13,000 words) with a very big and provocative message: the idea that we control our actions through a sequence that begins with a decision to act, ending with the action itself, may be fiction. In other words, free will might well be a myth. It is. of course, very difficult to prove a negative statement, particularly when \\"hard\\" evidence is lacking. The only experiments of note, and Harris describes them in detail as have others, are those of Libet (1983) where he showed that the neural spike for a specific act preceded the intention spike. In other words, we act first, think later (not much later, of course, just milliseconds). Harris does possess the credentials necessary to write about such matters (PhD in Neurosciences from UCLA), but until Libet's experiments are confirmed/disputed by more elegant means, the question will remain more philosophical than scientific. Even so, it is a very important topic, one that has profound implications, if true, for how we behave in society. For example, if the act of pulling a trigger occurs before the intent, can any murder ever be considered premeditated?<br />A good read. Well worth the time, and more.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|I went back and forward on this one and an aftermarket cheapy.  This is the one I ended up going for and as soon as I put it on the camera I knew I had made the right call.  It matches the body build quality perfectly.  My only complain was a small bubble on battery door rubber.  Not a big deal, probably wouldn't have noticed it if I wasn't scrutinizing the daylights out of the thing.  Luckily because of my experiences with the cheapy battery grips for my other cameras, I'm pretty experienced with taking the rubber off and re-gluing it back sans bubbles.  For that matter it really is small enough I may just leave it.  At any rate, I would definitely suggest this grip over the aftermarket grips especially if esthetics matter to you.
B004PR71JC|5.0|My daughter fell in love with the movie so I thought why not buy the CD so that she enjoys car drives more? she was absolutely almost dancing out of her car seat and that's a winner for me.Even as adults we enjoy this too, it's not too \\"kinder music\\" like other music choices. My daughter is almost 2 and this is a great way to introduce samba and bossa nova (albeit modernized versions)to her growing musical taste.Must buy if you love the movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was just looking for something fun to do to pass time when I have breaks from work or just from my day in general.  I played a basic game so far, and I'd like to see what else it can do.

B004SEUIWO|5.0|There isn't a weak performer in the cast. The filming and the music couldn't be better. A must see for adults.
B000001DQG|5.0|Own the album as well. Elton John during this time period is the best. Pre disco Elton John is great.
1575666286|5.0|I bought this as a personnal form of information, but it later became a gift to a friend.<br />I can only hope they, and their family are able to read and apply the techniques and recipies in this book to their advantage.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|When I opened a direct publishing account, I downloaded this.  It's very straightforward and easy-to-read.  There are a lot of &#34;Oh, duh!&#34; moments when reading this that tell you what you probably should have done while writing in the first place, so read it at the very least before you start investing time in formatting (especially if you're using Microsoft Word-- don't jerry-rig the formatting).
1439148953|3.0|I recently read Mr. Toibin's novel, Brooklyn, which was suggested to me by a friend from Dublin. Unfortunately for me and for Colm Toibin, it happens that I grew up in the part of Brooklyn where he sets his story. From the very few specific facts he mentions (Clinton Street, Fulton Street, the church, etc.) most everything in the Brooklyn section of the book took place a few blocks from my family's brownstone on Congress Street, between Court and Clinton, across the street from Saint Paul's Church.<br /><br />The Brooklyn Mr. Toibin pictures at the start of the 1950s is totally completely wrong. It's more like Brooklyn in the 1930s, as far as the Irish and Italians go . . . or maybe he was picturing an alternative universe.<br /><br />In the late 1940s through the 1950s, 100,000 Puerto Ricans moved to NYC from their island, a great many to my neighborhood. By 1951 the three local movie theaters (the Lido, the Paris Court and ?) were showing Spanish language films. At that time the Italians and the Irish were close, and the Puerto Ricans were, for a time, the outsiders. The weekend dances given at Saint Paul's had zero Irish music and instead featured Latin steps. We did the rhumba, the mambo and the cha cha cha.<br /><br />And what ever happened to the Korean War and the draft? Tony, the Italian who is dating Eilis, and his brothers would have been up to their necks in that war.<br /><br />So Toibin got everything wrong. Why? I'm 78 now, but in the early 1950s I was a teenager living in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Other than that, I liked the book and the writing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|hidden object game that makes you think. Graphics are good and for what you are getting you can't beat the price.

B003L77G6K|5.0|We got hooked on this show a few months ago, and love it!  We could rewatch the episodes multiple times and it would never get old.  I would highly recommend this show!
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Although I normally stay clear of biography's I was very interested in this one. Steve Jobs it transpires was not the easiest to be friends with, work with or work for!  Am only about 70% into the book, upto the launch of iPod so far. Great insight into how business was carried out between these companies and the competition between them. As for relationships, I dont know how anyone wanted to be around the man.<br />Worth a read
B006MW3V6U|5.0|There is a reason this show is such a hit! It transforms you to a different time and a different place. A must see.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Interesting movie, I haven't researched it yet, but if this stuff is really true. Two things will deffinately come out of it.<br />1) the pulluted  water will slowly begin to kill thousands of innocent people.<br />2) the people will FINALLY REALIZE this government does not care one bit about the average citizen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think its a great way to stay entertained. It keeps my son occupied too!  The games are not too hard; but not too easy.
B007HACDLK|3.0|This book was long on dialogue but short on intrigue in my view.  I enjoy Vince Flynn and Mitch Rapp but some of the &#34;conversatons&#34; with the boss were too unbelievable as is the Hurley character.  The author has Mitch becoming too extreme.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I am currently reading the Kindle version of The Secret Garden based on my daughter's recommendation. (I have seen the \\"For TV movie version\\" which is good). The book is much better than the movie.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Although Solitaire is an easy game to play, you do have to keep your eyes on the cards at all times. I have Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and one of the symptoms is having cognitive dysfunction and mine can be quite severe at times. I enjoy playing as keeping track of the cards being played helps in keeping my cognitive skills up. Being able to track the time it took me to play a game as well as moves made makes me want to beat each score. I recommend Solitaire not only for anyone as I was taught to play around age 6 and I'm now 55, but I highly recommend that anyone suffering from cognitive dysfunction be it from MS, early onset of Alzheimer's/Dementia, or anything else, Solitaire is a fun and easy way to keep your mind thinking.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. I can say that I play this game all the time and never get bored of it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It is great; not perfect, but great. A lot of authors make the mistake of thinking their stories are worth so many pages than they are. They draw out plots that are barely there, and focus on characters you don't care about. I might argue Green did the opposite; not by much, it's walking a fine line of course. But I, for one, would have appreciated developing Augustus and Hazel more, as well as giving more breadth to their relationship. All in all, I'd say when your biggest criticism about a book is simply that there isn't more of it, it's accomplishing the only task it's meant to serve.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A well written story. I liked the honesty of it. A great book for anyone who likes real life drama and a bit of sadness.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Best album I ever had. I grew up with it. Came in good time, was in fgood shape, everything I expected.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is just like Super Mario Brothers and my kids love it, and when I have down time, I like to play it as well.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Little disappointed. I expected a lot more given the hype associated with it.  Without giving a spoiler the end was lacking.
B00000IZOR|5.0|A throw back to days gone by. Every generation in my family has had this toy. Couldn't pass it up for the newest member of the family. He loves it. Funny, how the 9 year old granddaughter had to be told how a phone like this worked in the &#34;olden days&#34;.
B006P3HXZG|3.0|Wasn't too sure about this spin off, but got it anywhere. Not as funny or as creative, I actually fell asleep while watching it, maybe because of the 3D? which, is not fantastic either. A OK movie, no need in 3D.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I was VERY impressed with this item! Performs even better than what I expected!  The playing area is way closer than it was before which is exactly what we needed for our small room!

B005LAIHZY|5.0|All the family had a blast watching this movie over and over again. received the movie right on time for Christmas :)
B004H1V5RU|3.0|The toy is a lot of fun and continues to be used for hours, however the design is flawed. The ball would get stuck in one location, so It had to be taken a part for an adjustment in order for the ball to roll smoothly.
1451683405|5.0|One of the things I like best about Sam Harris is his precision in the use of the language. He draws from a large vocabulary pool and constructs concise sentences/paragraphs to describe complicated themes and ideas.  He's crammed quite a bit in here and there's much to ponder and reflect about.  In fact, it's that element of self-reflection that enhances understanding of the concept.  Sam gives a solid philosophical and neurobiological base for his premise and then invites us to notice subjectively the inner dynamics of what's been explained.  Sam's book has been a valuable tool for personal growth.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book, I haven't seen the movie yet but, I really want to. this book was amazing READ IT. It's well worth the price
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The sound quality is awesome. The vocals are well done with these classic songs and bring emotional connection with each word sung.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|It's a tad longer than necessary, but other than that this is a wonderful follow-up to the CR movies (not counting Superman IV, which I refuse to acknowledge exists). Brandon Routh perfectly inhabits Christopher Reeves' Superman and Clark Kent both. Mild mannered, bumbling, clumsy reporter, inspiring hero to all. Also Kevin Spacy does and awesome Lex Luthor =) I recently read Larry Tye's Superman biography, and just finished the series Smallville, so I'm a bit of a fan. If you're cautiously optimistic about the upcoming Man of Steel, I highly recommend Superman Returns to help with the waiting!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Mark Wahlberg has proven time and again that he's a great 'straight man' in goofy comedies. Combine that with Seth Mcfarlane's sense of humor. Well there you go. There are times where the movie tries to be too serious and dramatic. Hence the 4 start rating
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Grand-son showed me this game and of course had to have it so we both could play. Fun and challenging game that keeps you entertained.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|A great version of the classic story. Visually and story wise extremly well done. It is on our short list of required viewing for Christmas every year. A great gift for other families......
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. I cannot wait go read this one!!!! I was so thrilled and surprised at the ending. Now for the 3rd book!!!
B000I0QM0E|5.0|I had this movie on VHS (yes, I'm dating myself).  I was going to just get the DVD, but thought I would get the Blu-ray since it wasn't much of a price difference.  I have to say - everything is better in Blu-ray!
0156034026|5.0|A great book that offers a new perspective. One of the best books I've read in a long time. An author with a great voice that delivers a solid read. Easy to see why it was an international hit.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I knew the movie was good when I bought it, I watched it in theaters twice, so I knew I'd be happy with the dvd. I  just wish it was ups or fed ex, I hate when things get left in the mailbox, my mail lady I swear watches my movies and reads my magazines.<br /><br />But it arrived very quickly, less than 4 days im pretty sure. =]
B000SGRONM|4.0|This was a great book and was entertaining. Most of the stories had to do with Christmas with a few having to do with Easter.  Overall, very entertaining.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Love this movie, great deal and great quality.  So many discs for such a low price!  I keep one upstairs and one in the family room.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|Awusume movie I love this movie its funny in some parts I watch this all the time i would recommend this movie to everyone.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|A must watch at Christmas time.  My kids watch this movie over and over.  It's just not Christmas until you've watched Home Alone.
0821210920|4.0|Yeah its dated, but if you like Ansel you need it just to get in the mind of the master. It refers to film, but many of the techniques can be used for digital. Great book, used - smelled musty so I knocked off one star.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book and movie similar but differences make both really good definitely would recommend for someone to read this book, can't wait to read the next two
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book hit on all the things I loved and grew up with.  Fans of 80's movies, computers, video games, rpg's, anime and music will likely enjoy this book.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|My son simply loves this movie and the music.  He has always wanted to join the military and this movie confirms his reasons why.
0345803485|2.0|I wanted to love this book, especially since everyone else seems to...I must be in the small majority who wanted a strong female protagonist. While the scenes are somewhat racy, the rest of the narrative left me annoyed and agitated, as if I were having a conversation with a 13-year-old girl who still didn't know the definition of a menstrual cycle. In short, if you read this book, pretend you're watching a video and just fast forward to the good stuff so you don't have to hear her talk to her \\"inner goddess.\\" BARF
B006FE83UE|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie, it makes me want to be a better person. NO attempt by current Hollywood braindead, money hungry morons should ever consider doing a &#34;remake&#34;.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Spoiler alert: hope this does not give away too much.<br />I have a tradition of watching this movie during the Christmas season, it makes me smile.<br /><br />This is such a feel good movie, where the under dog (rat) succeeds.<br />Also the guy (chef) gets the sous chef (woman) and everyone is happy, except the bad guy.<br />Also includes a bit of the Scrouge type character reformation. Yea!!!!!!
0811876373|5.0|I learned how to make cake pops last year and this was recommended to me. It has some good ideas
B00338QENI|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. I was familiar with the \\"basic\\" story of Henrietta Lacks and HeLa cells as I have a Clinical Research background. But this book really takes the reader to the heart of the matter: human beings. The author paints an honest picture of the subject matter. Nothing is sugar coated. You fall in love with Henrietta's family, flaws and all. Your heart actually breaks for her daughter, as the story of her longing for her absent mother unfolds. She defiantly fights for recognition, not fame, recognition for her mother.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the science presented in this book. It is broken down well for a lay person.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got  it for grankids. They liked it but not sure how much they played it. No complaints from them
B005USZYDU|5.0|Kid Lawyer was typical Grisham, great.  I'm sure my interest in law taints my rating and pleasure of this book.  But it was another can't put down. Like watching a good movie, you just want to seee what happens nextr.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is just more of the same in a great series.  Martin continues the saga right where he left off and keeps on running.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|The only video I got was g a n g n a m style the reason I did that because I have stupid spell check on and don't know how to take it off.Anyway not recommended from my opinion if you like getting to watch at max 3 videos and having to wait to download them,then not even getting them go ahead download this crap app
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was a very Cute movie. Watched it with friends and we enjoyed it for a girls night out.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I have said it before about Albom. He could ask a hundred people what they read of any of his books and I think he will get a hundred different answers. Each of his books I have found myself in. Sometimes wishing of something I might have done differently, sometimes regretting of something I have done. It is just hard to explain. I'm pretty sure he isn't just doing these stories for my pleasure. But enjoy them I do. I would recoment that anyone give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter and grand daughter are both addicted to this game.  They both told me to give this product a thumbs up.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|THis book is a classic and is a must read for all literature fans. Definitely a long more difficult read compared to modern literature - but that's the point right!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have read a lot of books on this subject and this is definitely not the best one I've read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like the fact it keeps you interested and challenged just enough. The story line is also weird enough to keep you wanting more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This isa great game to play anywhere and anytime  A game that anyone of any age can play.. Try it.
1416594795|5.0|Of course, Dawkins goes on to compare this to the creationists refusing to believe in evolution. Yes, he does attack them, but I totally agree with him: evolution is an established fact (or nearly one) from all the evidence we have collected, and the evidence right in front of our eyes. And I really think that anyone who only believes that the world is 6,000 years old is blind, refusing to admit the discoveries the human race has made. You can believe that evolution was created by God for some unfathomable purpose, and that's perfectly reasonable if you're religious, but it's difficult to rationally not believe that evolution does exist. I would agree that there's plenty to be said about this topic, but it is tiresome when there are so many people who refuse to acknowledge even its possibility. Fossil evidence shows that the world is much, much more than 6000 years old.<br /><br />In The Greatest Show on Earth, Dawkins has written another excellent book defending evolution. He has written against religion before; this book is not about that. Using amazing analogies and examples, Dawkins piece by piece takes apart the creationism arguments, to strip it to the bare truth: evolution is real. All scientific evidence points to it. I know that really religious people can say that mysteriously, God altered the world to look like evolution had happened, but that argument has no basis in fact, or even reasonable conjecture.<br /><br />Back to the book. Again, I really love the analogies and examples Dawkins uses. They're easy for the layman to understand, but also highly scientific, and rooted in fact. It's not like he's dumbing anything down; he's just showing clearly the evidence. Dawkins provides examples of natural selection over millions of years, and of natural selection that we've seen happen literally in front of our eyes. He also goes over artificial selection to set up explaining natural selection, and time clocks that can be used to date igneous rocks, and thus, fossils. Basically, Dawkins covers many, many ways of looking at how to explain and/or \\"prove\\" evolution. He outlines some of the greatest natural/artificial selection experiments: for example, the foxes in Russia (I love that one) and the famous guppies.<br /><br />I also love the 4 sections of color plates; they really add a lot to the book, and they're also very beautiful to look at. There are some lovely photos there.<br /><br />I'd actually read the first half or so of the book while in Miami Beach 2 or 3 years ago, but when I left, I had to abandon it. At the time, I didn't really understand the chapter on clocks for dating the age of something. I still don't understand it completely, as it's a mind-blowing and extremely complicated concept but now, having learned a bit of chemistry last year, it does make a lot more sense. And I definitely learned a lot of new things from that particular chapter (and other chapters too, of course).<br /><br />The last thing I want to touch on is Dawkins's style. He adds humor to the book; it's not just a dry science textbook-like concoction. Instead, it is a highly engaging work that keeps your interest the whole time (I might even do it for my book talk eventually). I would highly recommend this amazing science book, and I think perhaps I'll read Dawkins's The God Delusion soon.<br /><br />My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|High school is not a friendly place for off-beat kids, especially the vulnerable, \\"damaged\\" ones. With his letters to the reader, Charlie invites you into his psyche, his family, his world. While there is angst there, you also get to share in his joys and<br /> loves. And Charlie's observations on life -- the questions he ponders -- are illuminating. You find yourself wrapping him in your own heart.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it. Might give the movie a try, might not.
0525953728|5.0|No secrets revealed here - I don't get the hype from the brass.<br /><br />Since the public never got to see a corpse we'll never know if this is fact of fiction.  Good, quick read nevertheless.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|My friends and family don't like it.  I like the visuals and production.  It is good.  The story is too depressing for me to enjoy though.  It is a fantasy so I enjoy that aspect.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book gives an honest insight on the world of a teenager, who doesn't quite belong anywhere, but manages to find himself through new friends, new experiences as a high school freshman, and correspondence with an unknown friend.<br />Once I picked up the book I found it hard to put down.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Not the belly cramping knee slapper that all the reviews described it to be, but still a comedy worth making you leave the house and spend some money to see before it hits the free market. If you don't know who Flash Gordon is, do some research or you won't get one of the main plot lines to this story.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Bored?  Put this on in the  background and enjoy some very nice visuals.  great times are here again. Not sure it could be better.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|4.5 stars..I'll read anything that Colleen Hoover writes!! I fell in love with her writing after Slammed and Point of Retreat. Hopeless story was very well written and has a very intense story line. I liked how the chapters were written as a timeline so that Sky could share her old memories and what was currently happening with her.<br /><br />The reason why it's not 5 stars - The only stretch in the story was how Holder and Sky are able to find each other again after 13 years. If someone really wanted to disappear and the other moves away, what are the chances that they end up living just two miles from each other and see each other at the grocery store?
0062101897|5.0|My husband loves it! I like to look at it as well. It's a little heavy but has awesome pics and lots of good info.

0446580848|1.0|Having read most of Nelson DeMille's books I actually pre-ordered this book.<br />WHAT a let down!!!  Don't buy this book.It was like  it was written by a fourth grader.<br />Mr. DeMille just goes on and on never getting anywhere. I didn't want to give up so I forced myself to read half the book.<br />But no more!! I smartened up.

0312641893|5.0|As the year is beginning to come to a close, I've realized that there are a lot of books I missed out on this year. There were so many great debuts that have come out that I simply didn't read and I don't know why. And so, as 2013 is looming, I'm trying to get in some last minute reads before their sequels come out in the spring. Cinder by Marissa Meyer is one such book.<br /><br />In Cinder, Marissa Meyer weaves a tale of a young woman living in the futuristic city of New Beijing which lies in the Eastern Commonwealth. Across the world, a plague is slowly creeping its way accross nations, killing all of it's victims and no one can seem to find a cure.<br /><br />Now Cinder has some problems. She lives with her horrible step mother and step sister, she's forced to give all of her hard earned money to her step mother and worst of all, Cinder is a Cyborg. Because of a near fatal accident when she was young, scientists implanted robot parts where her human ones were damaged. She's forced to live the life of a lower class citizen, trying to be invisible. That all changes when the prince of the Eastern Commonwealth comes to her shop for a repair. Cinder's world is turned upside down after Prince Kai leaves her shop as Cinder learns more not only about the world she lives in, but aslo about who she really is.<br /><br />This book blew me out of the water. I believe it may be my favorite book that I read all year. There were so many things that I loved about this book, the characters, the setting the plot... EVERYTHING and I'll explain why.<br /><br />The characters: Not only did I fall in love with the human chacracters, but Meyer's non-human charaters cracked me up as well. Cinder is such a great YA heroine. She's got the whole package and more. I loved finiding out more and more about her past and although I picked up on a lot of the plot twists at the begining, Meyer wrote in such a way that had me excited to simply see how the characters lives  played out.<br /><br />Prince Kai was such a dreamboat and I would have fallen for him too had I been in Miss Cinder's shoes. Other minor character's like Cinder's step mom and step sister were interesting as well. It was hard not to dispise her step mother and evil step sister and you couldn't help shed a tear as her younger sister fought for her life. Meyer gets an A++ in the character department.<br /><br />The plot: As I talked about before, Meyer had such an exquisit way of presenting her story, I just couldn't put it down. While some points were slightly predictible to the frequent reader, it was hard to keep from skimming through the pages just to see what would happen next.<br /><br />The setting: I've saved the best for last. As someone who reads primarily YA fiction, I can tell you that it's not often that you read a book with an Asian theme, much less Asian characters. This subject is near and dear to my heart. I lived in China with my family for a while as a kid and I majored in East Asian Languages in college. I even had the opprotunity to study in China for a semester. I was so excited to see that the Asian culture was featured in a YA story and I think that this aspect really brought the story home for me. I've been to Bejing many times and so to think of the city in the future, was so awesome.<br /><br />As you can see from my crazy gush of a review, this book is a jem  and if you haven't read it yet, do it now!<br /><br />10 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)Prince Kai was such a dreamboat and I would have fallen for him too had I been in Miss Cinder's shoes.

B0068ENZMW|4.0|High quality recording. Background &#34;sound effects?&#34; can be a little distracting.<br />I am a Dune junkie, so I am enjoying listening to this on my commute to/from work
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|As I was just getting used to it, it started saying that it couldn't connect to camera and that mycamera has stopped working. Watch out for that!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Started my search for something to help me work with g+ on my Fire. Found that Flipboard had high ratings so gave it a shot.<br /><br />Easiest setup and integration with other social media accounts and sharing apps that I've encountered in a year with my Fire.<br /><br />Layout and UI are clean with intuitive and (finally!) fun navigation. Beautiful presentation of photos included from my feeds.<br /><br />Very, very pleased--would pay money for this. Other developers: Take Note!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I eagerly awaited reading this book after all the reviews I had read but found it not to my taste at all
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The fifth book in the series, this one is substantially better than the fourth, its twin. While still at times suffering from slow pacing, the characters followed in this book (Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion, etc.) are more interesting than the characters in the previous (too much Cersei) and there actually seems to be plot instead of endless minutia.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|What  a touching magical movie. My Sister and I enjoyed so very much.<br />So very heart warming. I recommend to sisters of all ages.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I gave this Christmas classic movie to my daughter, who enjoyed it as much as I did.  She was very pleased with the gift.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hard to put down with unexpected twists and turns. A quick read and enjoyable characters worth getting to know. I'll be reading more by this author.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark places was a good mystery book. Gillian's writing leaves you anxious to keep reading chapter after chapter. Her endings are worth reading for.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book,in fact one of my best reads of 2012.I look forward to any new books by the author.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I really enjoy this app. I like to read over the news of the day with my morning breakfast and coffee and this is a really simple way to do it. My only real complaint is that is doesn't really post enough stories and doesn't update often enough. This app is very easy to use and navigate though. I compare it to the CNN news app, which has a way more stories and update far more often, but has terrible navigation. Definitely worth downloading.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|great value and add on for my receiver, no need for various docs for iphones or other smart phones - connecting is a breeze with this
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book was very different from anything I have ever read but it wasn't a waste of time. It was just average.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Too many layers and not enough instruction.  Still learning some of the best ways to do things.  Review may change if I stick with it.
0226264211|4.0|I bought Capitalism and Freedom because it was one of the two suggested other books for me to buy with The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. Knowing that Milton Friedman was a well respected, Nobel Prize winning Economist, I was quite surprised to find myself reading a book that was more of a philosophical and political text than a technical economic book. I was however, intrigued with the subject matter and enjoyed the book very very much and I would recommend this book to anyone no matter their political or philosophical affiliations.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was really pleased with the development of the characters and the way the book progressed it was a realistic storyline.
B000002MP2|5.0|This album is great. The songs are hard, not to mention very catchy. This kickstarted a punk rock rebirth in the '90s, with several punk rock bands entering the music scene. This is an album often imitated, never duplicated, and an all-around blast to listen to.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This is not the first time I played this game because it was fun before and now it is so frickin retarded and the controls gave me a headache and to say about this is an issue and I have anger management and right now it has pissed me off
0385535139|5.0|John Grisham nailed this one.  Absolutely one of his best books in years.  Excellent story, excellent ending, he wrapped everything up leaving no loose ends.  With this book everyone wins including his readers!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good read. I am looking forward to the next book in this exciting series! Differed a little from the movie.
B000002H97|5.0|I, personally, really like it. The songs are strong, very hard-hitting and have very good lyrics. And, while I will say it's not as strong as Metallica's earlier works, it stands on its own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book read in quite a while can't wait to watch the move and then read book 2 catching fire
B004M6UCI8|5.0|For anyone wanting to hear a great flutist play a huge repertoire of flute concertos, this is the CD set to get.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Most boring book in the world. Do not get this book never ever just do not get this horrible book.
B00378VGGO|5.0|One of Wes Anderson's best movies, with heart, humor and the golden glow of wistful wisdom.  Gets better each time you see it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love this series. This is probably my favorite of the books I think there should another one :)
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|it starts with a good way. Middle of the movie is really boring. End of the story is also good. From beginning to end worst thing about the movie is sound. If someone talks you can not hear but effects are too loud. All I can say i am glad i did not watch it at movie theatre.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like it.<br /><br />It a good book I use it all the time for homework and I like it vary<br />Good
B002ZG97M4|5.0|I love this movie.<br />The bonus features make it even more interesting and memorable, plus the movie itself is beautiful on an HD tv.. a real pleasure to enjoy.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It's a good idea to make this book because you can learn more stuff about the world .You can learn how to talk different languages.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great read.  Another insight into the &#34;greatest generation&#34;.  Writer does a great job in describing the physical and emotional battles of two individuals on the opposite sides of WWII air battles.
B005FFW46S|5.0|After having read every Discworld book I could get my hands on - and hearing they could come to an end at any time now - I was delighted to find Snuff.  I bought it without hesitation, though in the back of my mind the debate about whether Pratchett still \\"has it\\" was lurking.<br /><br />Well, based on what I read, he definitely \\"has it\\" and he never lost it!  This book was just a delight.  Sure, it didn't focus on as many Discworld characters this time around, but what we did get was an excellent character study on Sam Vimes... and with all the Pratchett wit a loyal read would expect.  I found it thoroughly entertaining, hard to put down, and an excellent addition to the series.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This movie is five star dynamite. It has amazing one liners and an all star cast. Eartha Kitt and the guy who plays kronk are a hilarious duo. David spades voice is very convincing as the arrogant emperor turned llama. Love this movie as a kid, still amazing as an adult
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A bit long hand tedious at times, but we'll worth the read. The x-ray function is great for this book. With so many names to keep track of, it's useful to just pop in and out of the story
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Very useful item, it can help you reach distances that you could never reach, but if you want to connect a webcam, you will need a fast computer.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's now one of my favorite go to movies to put a smile on my face. McAdams character is full throttle zany and \\"adorable.\\" Ford gives a great turn as a grumpy, old news man. Keaton is fantastic. Phenomenal cast overall.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I liked the real facts mixed with fiction makes for a very entertaining movie. After watching it on my kindle I went out and bought it. The only thing I didn't like was the buffering
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I really did not like the book and I'm not much of a reader plus I always hated reading but I think reading it's important when you need it in life.
B008M87GJK|1.0|I still have not been able to download it to my Kindle. Every time I follow the directions it ends up telling me I have already purchased it. I gave up. So I don't actually hate it, I have found another way to access it.
B008JFUUQ2|1.0|You have to be a teenager to give this more than 1 star. The acting is horrible & the plot is ridiculous.  My daughter rented this & I suffered thru it. Don't waste your time
B0098Z64US|5.0|I have really become crazed over David Garrett's music.  I have most of his CD's and DVD's that are available in the US.  He's a rock star in Europe and I'm sure someday he'll be truly appreciated in the US as well.  I love how he effortlessly combines classical, pop and rock.  He's called a violin virtuoso for a very good reason. His creativity and skill as well as the fact that he doesn't take himself too seriously makes him so much fun to follow.  I was really excited to receive this Deluxe Edition of his newest CD long before its March US release.  I was a little disappointed that the information and picture indicated there would be three postcards but there was only one; however the insert included in this edition explaining his thoughts about his music as well as the DVD more than make up for this oversight.  I pre-ordered this CD in November without having heard any previews ahead of time.  I knew it would be great and I already can't wait for his next CD.  I think you should check out the David Garrett Store on Amazon. Better yet...go to the links I've added and check out some of the other music I have.  [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]]  [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]  [[ASIN:B005OSUKSA Legacy]] You'll find some classical music as well as some of his classical/rock crossover music.
B008476HBM|5.0|It was a pleasant read.  I have always wanted to read it and I finally found the time.  I am happy that I did.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|This was a really terrible viewing experience. The movie would stop every five or ten minutes and try to reconnect. I have both Netflix HD and Vudu HD and HDX. Neither of these other two streaming services had any problem in delivering smooth stable images. I tested my connection and and got a little bit more than 5 Mbps - well above what Amazon says is needed.<br /><br />Let me remind you before you complain that I'm being unfair to the Batman movie - I''m reviewing this movie as delivered by Amazon streaming. I asked for my money back. No reply.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app... love being able to look at Pinterest on my Kindle!  Works the same as my phone... easy to navigate through
B0071CNGI8|5.0|This is a beautifully written story, not just about a boy and his horse, but about how an animal can make men during the most horrific of times, just take a minute and do the right thing.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Amazingly written, best book I have read in a long time.<br />Better than the books we have today, I couldn't have written it better myself.
1400067820|5.0|As I read this book I could feel my attitude towards life, progress, and purpose change ,I believe permanently.  I hope the philosophies and attitude espoused in said book become foundational to shaping the values of my generation as we consider what we should do (or not do) with this crazy living world in which we find ourselves.
0807262013|5.0|This rating is for the full unabridged audio book.<br />Philip Pullman does an excellent job of narrating his books, as does the supporting cast.<br />The story itself is really as much for adults as for older children and explores theological. philosophical scientific themes to the level of so-called Dark Matter and creation theory. It melds the themes of original sin, the soul and good and evil with the building blocks of the universe. In the telling, it does not treat younger readers/ listeners with any less respect than adults.<br />There has been speculation as to why the second two books in this series were not given the 'Golden Compass' filmic treatment and that the Catholic Church were to blame in this respect, for its condemnation of the apparent anti-Catholic nature the story. It is most likely that the first film didn't gross so well, thus funding was not forthcoming to complete the film trilogy. However, it does suggest that the work is taken seriously enough for Church to shout, in the words of Father Ted, &#34;Down with this sort of thing!&#34;.

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|\\"Hitchcock\\" (2012 release; 98 min.) is based on Stephen Rebello's non-fiction book 'Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho'. As the movie opens we see that Hitchcock is enjoying the success of 1959's North by Northwest movie, and is now pondering his next project. Paramount Pictures would like for him to do another North By Northwest-like movie, but Hitchcock is itching for something different and challenging. He stumbles upon the book Psycho, and decides that will be his next project. Paramount resists of course, and Hitchcock in the end finances the movie pretty much by himself. But the REAL story of \\"Hitchcock\\" is not Psycho, or not even Alfred Hitchcock himself, but instead Alma Reville (a/k/a Mrs. Hitchcock) and her relationship with Alfred and other people in her life. In that sense, the movie is really mistitled, and a more appropriate title would be \\"Mr. & Mrs. Hitchcock\\". I don't know to what extent the movie is a correct reflection of historical facts, but I was quite surprised to learn of the active role that Alma played in (i) rewriting the script for Psycho when rewrites where needed and the original writer was unavailable, (ii) stepping in as a director when Hitchcock fell ill for a few days, and (iii) re-editing (along with Hitchcock) the film after the initial cool reception (it was her Alma's insistence that the now infamous musical score for the shower scene was added).<br /><br />Several comments: the acting in the movie is superb throughout. I felt a bit sorry for Anthony Hopkins as he has the impossible task of bringing an iconic character like Hitchcock to life, but Hopkins did pretty well. However, the scene-stealer par excellence is Helen Mirren as Mrs. Hitchcock: she truly brings the film to life. At one point, when Hitchcock suspects her of having an affair with another writer, Alma dresses down Hitchcock (figuratively), and it is one devastating scene and the highlight of the film.<br /><br />Kudos as well to Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel, in the choice supporting roles of Janet Leigh and Vera Miles, respectively. Johansson is just ravishing. I don't know why but I had very little expectations going into this movie. I shouldn't have worried, as the movie simply flew by in no time and I enjoyed this a lot more than I ever expected.ica Biel, in the choice supporting roles of Janet Leigh and Vera Miles, respectively.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|I really love this album. Lots of unique variety in their songs. So much power in their musicianship, lyrics, and melodies, without being overly angry.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is definitely a book where I could see another time reading it as being beneficial to understanding the essence of it's meaning. That being said, still a great story and an engaging read!

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I got this for my aunt as a gift<br /><br />She absolutely LOVED it.  Everything inside was so amazing and so cute.<br /><br />No complaints at all what so ever.
0393312836|5.0|Classic. Great read, intense book. Not made for the faint-at-heart. Interesting psychological study. Movie is great as well, but you'll never forget the graphic images imprinted on you by the book's descriptions.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|We rented the movie and while the movie was very entertaining, the streaming from Amazon was not very good. We constantly had to keep rebooting the tablet we were watching it on, every time we hit pause.
B009LY72LQ|3.0|Create-a-monster sets in general are a huge disappointment but this one gets the most play from my three girls. They love the wings and this wig. I do not recommend adding any other sets or the add-on packs. The body pieces do not feel as dense or as sturdy as the regular doll parts. This set was exactly as described with two torsos, one wig and shipping was fast.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The movie is epic, but only a short featurette as special feature. I'd like more, but this is probably not the collector item version.
0316143472|5.0|I'm super obsessed with David Sedaris. I have read all his other works. This one is moving as it is about his journey to quit smoking. Hilarious and emotional. Few writers can touch your soul and make you laugh out loud a few lines later. Honest and could be a good gift to someone trying to quit smoking.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Great movie with lots of action.  It's great to see the old timers like Sylvester Stallone, Mickey Rourke and Dolph Lundgren  together with the current crop of action heroes such as Jason Statham, Steve Austin and Jet Li, Randy Couture.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|All I have to say is wow, this is an amazing read. Thanks to the author for opening eyes and minds. Thank you to Shin for sharing his story.
B0094K1K42|1.0|Ugh, this movie was terrible. The story line was shallow, the acting was second rate which is hard to believe from actors like Charlize Theron. I wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So much happens in this book. Now I can't wait for the movie, or book 3 for that matter. Read this in less than a day.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|The only interesting thing in this movie is the star, Henry Cavil. This was not an original or interesting take on any movie in this genre.  I still think the old Harry Hamlin movie (Clash of the Titans) is far more interesting than any recent movie made in this genre.
B0057XMCLA|3.0|My daughter thought that this deviated too far from the novel.  We still enjoyed it though as it decently made.
B003W0BYQ4|5.0|I can't add a single thing to all the reviews I've read about this movie...it's timelessness, the fact that it's on so many &#34;My favorite movies&#34; lists and the mix of &#34;stars among stars&#34; for the cast...the cameo of music is just the icing on the cake. Martin and Nelson just make it all so, so ...well, as I said...it's all been said before!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hadn't read the book before I saw the movie, but even after seeing the movie there is so much more detail and back story in the book. I'm getting the next one immediately.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|This movie was a big disappointment given all the publicity it received when it premiered in the movie theaters months ago.  The all star cast of dancers had little if any dialogue.  There was never a complete dance routine for any of them.  If anything, Matthew McConaughey was more interesting than Channing Tatum, as his dance routine stole the show.  Who's idea was it to cast Kevin Nash as a dancer?  I'm glad they kept him in the background as it was obvious that he couldn't dance. All in all, I should have rented this movie instead of purchasing it.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|We had to watch this series in a Leadership class in college and this was just a great series. If you are at all interested in the realistic battle moments our guys go through you have to get this series. You will fall in love after the first episode.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|A classic, indeed. For someone not too fond of reading, this book has recaptured my interest in the activity. It is a significant and profound notch on the belt of the ever-enrapturing theme of the tragic love triangle. The 1992 film version of the novel is what first captured my attention. After seeing that film I had to pick up the book. It was the first book I've read in months and I'm glad that this was the read I chose. For some, the language may be a bit of a stretch to understand at first, but it quickly becomes 2nd nature (it's no \\" Nadsat,\\" courtesy of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The archaic punctuation and diction, as well as the unwarned flip-flop of narrators may lead to some turbulence in the read, but that's nothing a good dose of patience and willingness to reread the page won't cure. A plethora of the more critical reviews have pointed out that many, if not all of the characters are unlikable at least part of the time if not continuously, but I argue that it's their flaws and the causes of their flaws which make these same cruel characters interesting and worthy of our sympathy (sometimes). The novel draws upon very human emotions and very human reactions to those emotions which should satiate any readers' unconscious internal hunger for the exploration of  human depth and dynamics.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It was boring. I got the last book because the second book had a ciff hanger and I wanted to see what happened. I have had the book for awhile and still haven't finished.  The same old scenes are getting boring. -_- ZZZZzzzz
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is a must read.  Very writen.  Historically accurate developing an interesting story revealing a lot of things  you never knee before.  It gives you a good understanding of the time.
B008K8H9C6|3.0|Some of the puzzles require thinking, but mostly it is just like a doodle puzzle. Can provide a little distraction.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Overall I was very happy with this product. I brought it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved it. My only two complaints was that there aren't a lot of bonus features on the DVDs and when I received my DVD box set the part inside that allows you to rotate through the disks was broken making it hard to close. I didn't want to rate it to low though because it serves its purpose.
B001XUQXCA|4.0|This book was interesting to read but not for elementary and middle school kids but it's a good book in itself
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. It's fun and addicting, and great for animal lovers. The only problem with the game is that if your impatient you have to spend money on peanuts to make things go faster.
0525952926|5.0|This is a good trilogy but disappointing that it will note be until 2014 that the trilogy is complete. This is a disappointment as we will have to keep track of the books to get the characters back in place. With these types of books we normally take them to our small Library who put them in their collection nad when interest dies they sell the books and buy new ones.
B005LAIHCW|4.0|\\"Sometimes people can't be fixed.\\" Sarah (Shue) and her daughter Elissa<br />(Lawrence) have just moved to a new town. They love their new house and<br />the new friends they have made. They did move next door to a house that<br />4 years ago was the site of a brutal double murder. They were assured<br />that the killer was dead, but sometimes people don't know the whole<br />story. This is not a bad movie at all, I wouldn't say its that scary<br />but I did enjoy it. The one big problem with this is that there were a<br />lot of parts that seemed to drag and didn't really move the story<br />forward. I think the problem was that the story was really a good half<br />hour TV show type plot that tried to make it into a full length movie.<br />That doesn't always work. I'm not saying not to watch because it is<br />worth watching but don't go in expecting a full on horror movie.<br />Overall a good movie that is worth seeing but not what I expected. I<br />give it a B+.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this is a good game fun to play challenging i would recommend it to anyone who loves to play games
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this trilogy! So good! I've probably read it about 4X already!! Can't get enough of it!  Love Love LOVE!!!
0525951652|5.0|This book gets your interest and you have to get each book to keep up with the character. see comments in the second book. We were caught up with this book and went straight into the next book. A good read and the book kept my interest all the way to the end.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Kept my interest throughout. Tom Clancy is an author. I hope to find additional titles similar. I will certainly look for other Clancy works.

B000VYX8PE|5.0|although very sad a mentioned in the title, Lemony Snicket has done a fabulous job comining an element of suspense with an element of mystery.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|My husband and I saw this movies the other night, although very long it kept you engaged.  Very good we liked it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Looper was good. Several great ideas in the movie. The time travel angle is sort of like vampires in that when you think such movies have been done to death some inventive writer comes up with a new angle to make it interesting. I liked the movie. I always enjoy Willis. I like that he doesn't stop making movies.This is not a review just a statement that I enjoy a good film and Looper is a good film. Worth warching for the new ideas on time travel.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Needed more of a story line, was mostly sex like the first two books, found myself skipping pages, was bored with all the sex scenes

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Colleen Hoover is one of my favorite authors.  This story is amazing and touching.  I cant wait to read her other books in the future!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|A book for young readers. I wish I had purchased something else. It's one of those reads which leaves you expressionless after reading the book.
1419705849|5.0|This book will be read, I promise you.  Adults should read it too because you are going to get some of the jokes your kids won't.  I amused everyone at the dance studio when I started laughing and couldn't stop.<br />Challenge one is to get my students to want to read... wimpy kid does that.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Tre! is perhaps the best of the trilogy, refined, mature, ballsy and intricate. And best of all, they sound like Green Day, unlike that 60's garage rock tribute that became Dos!

0525953728|4.0|After promising myself not to read it, I finally bought this book on 30 December, red it over the New Year and could not let go of it before the last page. As mentioned in the title of this review, I found it much better and much more intresting that what I expected.<br /><br />To be fair, however, my expectations may have been somewhat on the low side to begin with after having read a number of other books on similar \\"special ops\\" stories over the years. I finally went for it partly because of the topic itself - the taking out of the \\"arch-villain\\" (and I am not being sarcastic here), partly because it was marketed as a \\"grass-roots\\" story (the story told by a direct eyewitness) and partly because of the controversy surrounding the publication of the book (the so-called \\"national security\\" issues supposedly raised by its publications).<br /><br />Before going any further, I should perhaps mention that I am neither American, nor military or ex-military. I was somewhat surprised to find out how much passion this book has raised in the US, something that is rather well reflected through the Amazon reviews on the US site. I should also stress that I very much appreciated and liked this book, but not necessarily for exactly the same reasons as those mentioned by other reviewers.<br /><br />It is, of course, interesting to learn about the author's own experience in the Naval Seals in general, and in Seal Team Six, in particular, although this is not the most original part of the book. There is already a (surprisingly large!) number of other books on special forces and counter-terrorist or counter-insurgency operations carried out by a number of countries and this number has grown rather rapidly over the last decade. Many of these books describe gruelling selection and training processes and emphasize in various ways that the members of such elite units are \\"la cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me\\".<br /><br />What is less common, however, is for an ex-operator to publish a book during a presidential election campaign in order to \\"set the record straight\\" and \\"tell what really happened\\", at least according to the author. This is relatively rare, especially so recently after a supposedly secret operation. I was personally unable to find anything in this book which could justify any claim about any kind of national security breach, although the contents of the book, when compared with the official story and stance taken by the outgoing administration, do present some interesting differences.<br /><br />Many reviewers on the US site have tended to take sides, either for or against the author (and therefore against or for the outgoing Democrat Administration). After reading this book, I am not sure that this amalgam was intended by the author, and anyway this is probably not the most interesting feature of the book (in addition, of course, to the assault itself). What I found the most interesting - and worrying - element is the level of distrust in politicians that this book exhibits. This is probably regardless of whether the politicians happen to be Democrats (as here) or Republicans (as in the rather shameful episode where the real identity of a CIA agent was leaked). In both cases, the distrust - and perhaps even the contempt - shown by those actually risking their lives with regards to their political (and democratically elected) leaders seems to have reached high levels.<br /><br />I hope, as some reviews from US military personnel seem to suggest, that these feelings are not as widely shared as this book, and a number of other episodes, might suggest, although I simply do not know and cannot tell. Such feelings, however, are nothing new, as another reviewer has hinted at. The US military seems to have had similar feelings after the Vietnam War. Military forces in other democratic countries have also reacted rather \\"negatively\\" (to put it nicely) to what they have seen as the \\"self-interested\\" or even the \\"treasonous\\" behaviours of their elected Heads of State or Prime Ministers. For a rather extreme example, think of the rebellions of the French armed forces in Algeria in 1958 and 1961, for instance.<br /><br />So for me, this book has value largely - and perhaps mostly - because it shows these feelings. Since these are hardly flattering, it is easy to understand why a government - regardless of the democratically elected government's political affiliations - must have been rather unhappy to see it published: not exactly the best possible PR dujring an election year, to put it mildly. However, to finish on a positive note, the fact that the book was published also says something about US institutions and the way they work. In other (and perhaps most other?) countries, the publication might have been blocked or delayed, and the book heavily edited...ir elected Heads of State or Prime Ministers.

B007N0AEWY|5.0|Can't stop listening. Awesome! I like to put this on and let it go.  A great sound that raelly rocks.
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|I wish this edition came with more special features. The only features on these discs have previously been released on the DVD edition
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked this diary of a wimpy kid.Best  doawk ever!(Diary Of A Wimpy Kid)(DOAWK. Amazing  book jeff kinney. (Smiles). I am at the age of nine......
B0027MJU00|5.0|Very dark book.  The characters are easy to imagine and in some cases not very likable, but I'm sure that how the author wants it.  I certainly did not see the ending coming.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|To tell u the truth I was expecting the old version I used to play in grade school. then I found. out it wasn't and am now addicted
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This was a Christmas gift. My wife liked it so much better than the other one that she got as a present, she sent the other one back.<br />Bob
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Every page either my heart jumps, my stomach tightens, tears are shed, or I smile widely. I couldn't put this book down ( or the kindle) and can't wait to get the next book!!!!
B0013V33DG|5.0|This is Natalie at her best.  She is genuinely funny all while singing like an angel. Florez does a great Mes Amis and plays the innocent lover charmingly.  This would be a great introductory opera for young people.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|So I decided to watch this comic book video that would surely rape my childhood memories of reading its comic book counterpart.  I was suprised how much I liked this film. Parents be warned this movie contains some graphic violence and blood. I did find some faults... Peter Weller is awesome as a director, but as a voice actor( or Batman) he kinda sucks. He just sounds drunk or bored, or both. Apart from Wellers phoned in performance I really enjoyed the rest of action comic, animated film. It was honestly far better than I expected.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Momma Mia was Wonderful! What great music! Loved the movie. Anyone who loves musicals and romances  will love Momma Mia!
145210655X|5.0|Wonderful book of father and son.  My son loves reading it and he can point out all the references to quotes DV says in the movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|To be honest, I've never  read a book like this. From the first page all the way to the end I wanted and needed to know more. I have never read a book where I have  felt all of the emotion  so strongly. I am an avid book reader, but never once have I cried while reading a book. While reading hopeless I cried because you can really feel all of the emotions in this  book. They are  so powerful. I really felt sky and dean's love for one another. It felt so real and true. This book was incredible and if you have a chance to read it, you must! It is truly amazing .
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was great. I recommend it to everyone...I wish this circus was real...I would never want to leave. The story was great and it kept me wanting more.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The advertisements aren't overwhelming or inconvenient my placed.  The game is a lot of fun, and comes in handy while trying to keep the kids busy.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|needs a lot of work. its easier to use the full website. cant delete certain things. hard to navigate. can't view all pictures on someones profile..the list is long
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Advertisements don't get in the way and aren't a nuisance to the eye. Always a favorite with my toddler while grocery shopping.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game a lot of fun good way to kill time. Makes me mad sometimes when I can't get enough coins
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Okay, I've never been a big reader, and never really liked or enjoyed any of the books we had to read for English class.. but WOW. I finished this book within a couple days of getting it and it actually affected me more than I thought it would. I'd be up until 2 or 3 in the morning reading this book and crying as I did so. Each chapter ends with a 'cliffhanger' or with something romantic and you just can't wait to read more. The characters are so developed and they just go perfectly together. I can't wait to go see the movie starringChanning Tatum!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Enjoyed the film overall as did my wife, which is saying something for what is essentially a scifi action movie.
B009O2XY12|3.0|It is fun and cute, but there is a hangup in that once you have used up your &#34;energy&#34; it won't allow you to play for another 20 minutes.
0385523912|5.0|This well-written book humanizes the citizens of North Korea, while showing the regime for all its evil.  The defectors stories, primarily from the city of Chongjin, in the northern part of the country, far away from the manufactured facade of Pyongyang gives a truer \\"everyman\\" perspective of life by the majority of North Koreans, not just the elite in the capital.  The slice of life moments and the experiences told within, paint a vivid picture of the dire straights North Koreans face daily in the fight for survival.  I recommend this work as the definitive true picture of life in North Korea, and the struggle to survive, escape, and assimilate into South Korean culture.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is very cute and addictive. It appears simple, yet is deceptively complex in the way it makes a person think.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is the latest addition to my Beatles CD collection after LOVE.<br />Will it ever end? (laughs)<br />I think there is a limit to how much you can 'milk' the Beatles machine.<br />This album was nice because you can listen to the subtle difference in the the recordings, as they were first recorded before Phil Spector came in and 'enhanced' it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|By far the best book I have ever read. I have read it twice!! It's my absolute favorite series of all time!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Havent played the Blurays yet (will update later) but this set includes everything and more.<br />Nice package design.<br />All I need to buy now is...the Prometheus Bluray!<br />[Added comment Feb 8]<br />Wow, it took me a couple of days just to get through Alien3, and Im talking about the making of.<br />I never knew you could explore so much about a movie.<br />But there you go!<br />The ultimate anthology Bluray box.<br />No stupid DVDs like LOTR where some of the Making of discs are DVD, when clearly they should be BDs! Otherwise why am I buying a BluRay box set?
B0099114WO|5.0|If you've been married for a time, this hits home.  How true is every min of this movie.  Loved it !!!
B001782N4A|4.0|It was a gift & they loved it. Keeps all their wires organized in classic style. A Star Wars junkie must have
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I have watched and watched this movie.  It's is one of the best ones I've ever seen.  Very, Very  Cute !!!!
B000HT3PPG|4.0|Great movie got it fast!  Got it as an addition to the orginal one.<br />Just like this movie alot.  Colored version just not as good.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Such a very moving, great flick.  I really enjoyed each moment.  Very well done.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B00684J49U|5.0|The Packaging was perfect and the product works well and was presented as advertised. I would suggest this purchase to anyone who like Grey's Anatomy.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was very strange, but interesting.  One must wonder, &#34;Is this the way it might be in the future?&#34;
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book is directed more to those households that are surviving an affair are have potential for affairs.  But great advice for  all married couples.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|After watching the previews on TV, I was really expecting it to be a great movie.  It's well done and beautiful, but really no substance.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Love the fabulous cast and the variety of story lines and how they weave in and out of each other!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The future, present and past all come together with this movie.  Everything fits.  We loved watching this light, funny flick.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|My daughte in law has been wanting this forever.  I was pleasantly surprised when it came packaged in a display bottle.  Too cool.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|With the first two Bournes, I wondered how did this get started and what was given to Matt Damon to make him so much more effective.  This movie explains.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm addicted to this game as well as many others. But this game has always been my all time favorite.
0345536886|5.0|I read John Grisham all of the time.  Sometimes one just wants to go into and easy mode.  His books do that for me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I purchased this game for my daughter. She is completely addicted to it. I have it on my iPhone and my Kindle Fire. Great game!
B004SEUJBE|5.0|We decided to buy Chicago since we had not seen the movie.  No wonder it ran away with all of the Awards.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think this is a fun game for kids to make their own things and be creative.<br />And now we're looking up to the pigs perspective.And by my opinion this is a great game.<br />  Sincerely,<br />  15 year old robel araya
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everything in this series is perfect.  Cast, sets, costumes - perfect!  And the writing is 2nd to none.  The witty dialogue made me laugh out loud so many times my face was stiff from smiling.  You love some characters and despise others.  It's a testament to the entire ensemble - cast, crew and especially creator, Julian Fellowes
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The storyline is very intriguing, I did find the middle was a little slow but the author recaptured my attention.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Hey this app works great. I love the various search capabilities, especially by city and state. Now I can listen to my favorite radio stations back home.
1400064287|5.0|THis book is very enlightning. The concepts discussed in this book are important whether you are a college student or a senior.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Warning: this game app is addicting. Nice version to a familiar game with many various on the theme. Worth it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Hard for a 5 year old and gets frustration to them.  what is age for this game?  cute game otherwise
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was happy to find another good series of books.  Summary of Jack Reacher by my cousin:  Reacher, a man who lives light not because he must, but because he has no need not to. A man who has a very strong sense of right and wrong. A man who won't hesitate to stand up and place himself in harms way to right a wrong, to help a victim of evil, to fulfill honor. Of a huge, intimidating man whose very physical presence invokes awe, respect and fear. Who has the strength and ability to take on and whip 5 bad guys at once, with no hesitation.
B0072440OE|5.0|Una Norah Jones menos jazzy y bluesera, y mucho mas roquera. El disco suena un poco bajo de volumen comparado con otros vinilos que poseo. En cualquier caso un gran disco. Muy recomendado.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|great songs fun lyrics worth buying.  Different for Taylor swift to do much more pop then her normal stuff a ++++
B003MAOTP2|3.0|If I did not know much about the historical facts I would have given this a 4 or 5. Good action movie.
B006S08RLU|5.0|This is a very sweet film.  It has some of the most creative directing I have ever seen.  There are things that happen in this film you will not see anywhere.  I would not be surprised it becomes a cult classic. If you love film or love stories in general this is for you.  Loved it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I'm enjoying reading The Secret Keeper.  It's an interesting story that keeps your interest as the story of Dorothy unfolds as her daughter Laura searches for the answers to the many questions she has about her mother's past.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I believe this is a well written guide. I wanted to read through it to see if I might be interested in purchasing a Raspberry Pi computer.<br />The setup descriptions were very helpful, and I had no problems setting up the Pi once I purchased one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So intense I watched all of them in a day and I seriously recommend watching seasons one and two as well!
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Fannie Flagg is an all time favorite author of mine and was before I read Fried Green Tomaotes. All of her books are so funny, true to life and uplifting! If you haven't read her works, you should - all of them.
B001AGXEAG|4.0|loved both the movie and cartoon growing up and since both of the kids like what i like most of the time anyway
0062515675|5.0|This is a great book.  It's been awhile since I've read it and need to read it again.  I've shared it with friends too.
B000067FP8|5.0|both of my kids loved the cheezy movie they saw the first one and asked if there was a second so of course i had to find it for them
B00003CY6M|5.0|This movie was a gift for my sister.  We both love it and recommend it for a &#34;girls movie night&#34;.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I got this the day I got my Kindle Fire. A basic solitare game that I can play anywhere. I have enjoyed the game while traveling.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|I got hooked on Owl City with Fireflies and have enjoyed pretty much everything he has put out since. This album to me is just as good as the others.
B00650SSWG|3.0|I am not a big JT fan but figured I would give the movie a go. It was better than No Strings Attached. I would watch it again.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|One of the best movies of the holidays... My daughter watch it over so many times she knew all the songs... N what made it even better that not only was it a blue ray that a dvd also came with it... Very happy with it all...
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It was an exciting, highly interesting book especially as it related to the lives of the Luftwaffe pilots who found no relief from the day-to-day agonies that diminished their ranks over the months preceding the war's end.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|In this book Hitchens, in my opinion, pulled back a bit and fell short of his often vicious- biting commentaries, but I cannot help but admire and enjoy his narrative notwithstanding the the mortal wound inflicted on him and his illness may have been the sobering event and reason for the slight transformation (at least a little bit less, right?)  He faced his fears, played the cards he was dealt and marched into the battle of mortality.  Wonderful book, Hitch.  Thank you.  You belong to the &#34;gods&#34;.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This is a great game for your first hidden object game. It has a great storyline, but the hidden objects could have beenbetter
B0091REZMW|2.0|I like the review of the game. It was the reason for buying the game.  I thought to many rules.  I think you should read carefully, understand that  others take part in your game whether you want them or not. You also pay prosciutto play.<br />Be ware read the fine print before installing.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Gave this album to a friend. This is a great group and I think we will see them around for many years to come.
B000JQUQZO|3.0|If you love to read this is a nice book to pick up and kill some time, especially if you love the Roman era
B006X08FDA|5.0|I love their sound and song selections. A great group if this is your genre. You can't go wrong here.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|This order came on time, was in good shape, and was just as we ordered. We haven't watched it because it was a gift. Thank you!
B00260GLBO|4.0|Our 2 and 5 year old boys got this for Christmas and love the dumping action.  Appears durable (had it for a few weeks), yet detailed realistic components.  Plan to use it in the sandbox this Spring/Summer as an outdoor toy.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|This order came on time and was in nice shape, as it said it was. Thank you very much!! It was a gift so we haven't watched it.
B00012FXAE|5.0|great item
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is very roomy. I am able to fit my camera and my lens inside. I wish that it had a compartment to put my laptop in.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|This album is just wonderful and such a pleasure to listen to.  A great variety of very listenable music.  I highly recommend.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loves this book the best one at it so thank u to the man who wrote it love ya
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Either a regular reader or not, easy and powerful read. I enjoy the true life and truth of our past. Putting people first than just thinking of it as a war.
0486650677|5.0|It really takes you there. Very insightful and complete. Also, for those who like to know how things developed this book is a gem. I still use Symon's book for my general mechanics class, but Lanczos is absolutely necessary reading.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Well written.  Do I understand what is written? I would LIKE to say, yes.  However, I do feel better informed about up-quarks, down-quarks, their playmates and those who now play with all [?] of them. Fields: not so much.  Jon W Candy MD
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game was great but it needs so better add-on's too like the eating movement s and them not using there hands. :D
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  Can hardly wait for the next episodes beginning next month.  Watched series one and two on Netflix.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I'm so happy my friend told me to read this series.. I was sad when I finished 50shades trilogy n she told me to try this series...I LOVE IT.. I already preordered the next book..but I'm sad I have to wait so long to read it..
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Don't get me wrong.  The item arrived right on time, it was exactly what I expected due to prior knowledge of the product, but amazons picture is wrong.  The Cooler master 212 hyper plus comes with one fan, not two as shown.  However, you can buy and attach a second fan with the kit included with it.  The Hyper 212 evo comes with 2 fans and the same heat sink as the 212 plus.  However, it is not relay nesissary.  The cooler is a bit big but I expected that.  Over all no complaints.  Just wanted to give a small Public Service Announcement.  I cant wait to actually use this product once I get all my parts.
B0028ER4Q4|5.0|The Doors are in some ways very under appreciated. This album is awesome. The record itself is great quality, none of the QC issues that you hear about folks having on current pressings of vinyl.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I received movie quickly and in great shape.  Thanks for great service.  My husband wanted it and I surprised him.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so much more than I expected. The characters and plot deepen every chapter. By the time I was halfway through, I couldn't stop and spent the rest of the day reading, staying up late to finish it. This is so much more than just another teen love story. The author is to be commended for her gradual and masterful unfolding of the past events that shaped Sky and Holder. Loved the characters, the pace, the writing. Will definitely be buying more Colleen Hoover books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a story! The cover is beautiful but the story is heart wrenching! There are so many really beautiful things about this book and many tough issues addressed. I love that they are real and not just tossed into the plot for the sake of just creating drama. Colleen Hoover addresses many issues that many people face in a very direct way. My heart is full of so many emotions, but above all I am left with hope that no matter how ugly things get we can persevere and pull through. Maybe not easily or gracefully but it can be done. This story is amazing! Thank you Colleen Hoover for a story that will stay with me for a long time and also thank you for Holder!
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|This movie made me laugh out loud many times. Would recommend this movie to anyone with a decent sense of humor. Laugh on friends...laugh on!!
B002DOSBMK|3.0|Entertaining and interesting. With some trilogies sometimes the whole first book really drags in the lead up to the second and it gets better from there. That's what I'm hoping at least.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I would like to request a refund from Amazon Instant video.<br />This isn't the first time this has occurred with a streaming movie I have ordered with Amazon.<br />Hopefully they'll straighten it out.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I first pickled up \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" long ago because it was thereto read, but found I couldn't put it down. Now I have discovered \\"World Without End\\" as before the characters are real and complex, with dramatic intense lives. A perfectly written continuation of a captivating fictional history. Highly recommended.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|This is really a good concert to watch and listen to. The guys still sound good, and the back up band really adds to the sound..glad I bought this one. I bought is at walmart for $10 though. ck that out.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|I liked it! I like the Percy Jackson lightning thief books more just due to personal preference mostly. Percy just seems more like a hero. But this was very similar and I enjoyed it. Can't wait to read on!!
B009E3EXMU|4.0|This is a killer concert, better than I thought it would be. These guys still rock, and with Jason Bonham on drums (sounds like dad) they just nailed this show..If U like Zepplin U'll be happy, don't wait just buy..
B0063IH60K|5.0|excellent game very easy and quick to get into. Warning highly addictive.Looks good and plays well with plenty of options.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I am an aerosmith fan,,seen them twice in concert, but this new music just hasn't settled in with me yet. I'm still listening though, don't really know how to rate this one, guess U'll have to listen and decide on your own..
B005LAIHSG|4.0|its kinda dark but fanasy meets reality its crazy i liked it but i like lord of the rings and star wars so i loved it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't know what I was getting into with this book but I was drawn to it. This story is awesome how it unfolds. I will be reading more from this author!!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very surprised<br />I wasn't expecting the quality would be this good. I recommend downloading this if you like fantasy style games
B008QE9XD2|2.0|This is a great idea poorly executed.  All invloved are getting lazy and sloppy.  I miss the old Johnny Depp.  I am so over the eye rolling, oddly familiar performance.  He is becoming a one note joke.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't know why I keep reading people did not like the ending. I loved this book as much as the others and was actually pretty happy with the ending. It was exactly the way I had wanted it to be. It took me only a few days to read this book because I just couldn't put it down, so exciting and surprising. I just kept wanting to find out what happens next. I am a little disappointed though that there are no more books in this series but more than look forward to seeing the movies they make based on the second and last book. Definitely worth it to buy and worth the time to read! If you haven't read any of the books in this series yet I suggest reading all three, not just one.
1469273802|5.0|love he book on tapes, would buy each new one that comes out! I'm on disk 3 and take my car everywhere so I can listen.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a inspirational masterpiece. This book tells you to be yourself no matter what you look like this book has some really good words of wisdom and I think everyone should have a chance to read this delightful story!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I purchased the lifeproof case for my sister's iphone 4 and she loved it. The case fit perfectly and she was able to use her touch screen with her fingers and my stylus and it was sensitive enough.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't read the book till i watched the movie, i fell in love with both.  If you want to connect with the characters on another level, read this book!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Interesting read.  I think he is a good writer and he keeps me interested in the story.  I will remember this book.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" is a crazy-nuts crime novel centering around the world's worst marriage and the mysterious disappearance of the wife in the story.  An absorbing premise (Where's the wife? Did the husband kill her?), terrific second and third act twists, and the first completely successful use of the \\"unreliable narrator\\" device I've seen in ages (in other words, it's not frustrating when we eventually learn it was used in a sizable portion of the narrative) are only a few of the great things about the book.<br /><br />So, yeah, if you're looking for a bracing reading experience, one that works as both a straight-up, engrossing crime novel and a sly commentary on the pettiness and malice that can creep into even the best marriages on occasion, don't hesitate to pick up this sharp, scary, and often blackly funny thriller.<br /><br />By the way, I actually listened to the audiobook version of the book, and the two narrators- Kirby Heyborne and Julia Whelan- are wonderful, making the most of the great material at their disposal.  But I'm confident \\"Gone Girl\\" is just as much fun to read yourself, if that's your preference.  In any event, I'm now off to track down the small handful of other Gillian Flynn titles out there.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so alsom every one loves it alsom ;)  try it it feels like you qre alive in this game you would not like to stop playing.
B00001W9G0|5.0|We like to watch old shows, and in Sex and the City, the girls talk about this show, and I wanted to see it again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was an easy read and hard to put down. Hoping for a part 2. Love that it was.  Free Amazon book.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Worth watching and rewatching.  Wonderful acting by a stellar cast, especially Gary Oldman as George Smiley.  An instant classic in my book.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|The Litigators may be written by John Grisham, but you get that  distinct feeling it was actually written by an invisible puppeteer pulling all the threads together, one by one, to make sense of things that appear hopeless and disastrous at the outset. Each character is so complete, so well formed you get the chance to preempt what actions and reactions they will make from given events... because you get to KNOW them like...well like family! My only real wish is that John Grisham would write a book of sufficient length to really satisfy my appetite for the subject at hand. It always finishes too darn soon.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Okay, if this was a stand-alone, it would be a 4 star.  But the series is wonderful.  It is really interesting to read a book based outside of the USA (Finland? - can't remember at the moment), but that does make it a bit more difficult to understand at first (especially keeping track of names and places).  It took me about halfway through the book to get caught up in the story.  The last two I couldn't put down.  Stick with it.  It is worth it!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I give five stars to any show that I go out of my way to buy because I only buy stuff I thought was really good.  The first four episodes have action, but i just knew there was something we weren't being told.  I had questions, but the group of wanderers didn't seem the least bit curious like I was.  Then by accident the lid gets blown off the can, and, like the book you just can't put down, you will find yourself running non-stop through the rest of the episodes to see how it turns out.  Generally I think the activities and procedures we see among the group of survivors is typical of what you would do in a real-world situation, but I am constantly wondering, &#34;How come these people have not scrounged up a bunch of walkie-talkies so they can coordinate what they are doing?&#34;
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Again, the first one took me a while to get through.  But halfway through i was hooked.  The second and third I couldn't put down.  They are more intertwined than the first one.  I really enjoyed this series - so sorry the author died before he could write more.
B004DM0UII|5.0|The app works well and is &#34;behaved&#34;... no pop-up surprises or junk. If you like music that is slightly out of the box... this is your app.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The first book of the series took a bit of time for me to get into.  After i got halfway through it, i was hooked.  This one and the other one (i for get which is second and third) really build off each other and intertwine.  I couldn't put them down.
B000AGTPUK|2.0|The movie is spectacular.  it is everything i expected.  but the dvd kept skipping and pausing.  it had a lot of glitches in it.  the kids even commented on how often it paused and didn't run smoothly!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I really enjoyed this teen/young adult novel.  It is a growing independent girl, born to be the donor to her older sister who has a form of cancer.  She is fighting the request to give up one kidney - but wait till you see why.  It is a very touching, sad, yet uplifting story.  I highly recommend it.  Controversial?  I'd let my kids read it.  Tough issues handles well.
B00866JL96|4.0|Even with the dvd being used, it was in perfect shape. My daughters love the movie so we have already enjoyed watching it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I'm not all the way through this one yet.  It's a bit slow going.  Written as a diary or letter to us, his &#34;friend&#34;, it gives us the insight into a very lonely young man (teen) trying to find his place in the world.  Every time i pick it up, i enjoy what i've read.  It just isn't the kind of exciting novel that grabs me and draws me into it.  I keep expecting something bad to happen to him.  But, I'd still recommend it.  Controversial - yes, if you are concerned about drugs, alcoholism, sex, depression, gay characters.  But, I'm not, so for me i would recommend it to teens to read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This was the best game ever made it has so many games all in one huge bundle of joy. This is the reason I am very excited.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great stars, wonderful story, good location, fabulous story add up to one of the best movies I have watched lately!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|The fact that I can see this movie in blu-ray quality makes me very happy. I went to go see the movie when it was in theaters and fell in love with this classic all over again. Wonderful!
B009AZZEU2|1.0|I was REALLY excited prior to listening to the album for the first time, because 90% of the reviews I read for this album were glowing.  I was expecting big things, but unfortunately, I don't see what the big 'to do' about it is.  Are we maybe all just a little too desperate right now for some quality rock music?  It seems to be the case, where people are giving a very mediocre album rave reviews, just because the rock genre is ice cold, here in early 2013.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what Soundgarden was thinking, structuring the album the way they did.  They put the worst 4-5 songs on the entire album all at the very beginning.  Which is a very weird thing to do, considering most bands put the best songs at the beginning -- to set the tempo for the album.  Not Soundgarden.  I actually give them kudos for doing so.  It's different.  But it still threw me for a loop.  The album definitely gets better towards the end, but this isn't vintage Soundgarden by any means.  They touch on the old magic here and there, but overall, the album just isn't very good.<br /><br />I will likely have 0 of 12 helpful votes as a result of this review, but that's what you get when you have fanatical fans going through and giving a non-helpful vote to everyone they disagree with.  I think a ton of people got carried away with the 5-star reviews.  This is by no means a 5-star album.  I'm sorry, it's just not.  If you want to talk about Superunknown as a 5-star album, you wouldn't have to twist my arm too far.  But this album?  Sorry, never happening.<br /><br />I'd give this album 1.5 stars, but I went with 1 to temper down some of the extremist 5-star ratings.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great show and stellar episode. Emily Thorne is back and ready to make everyone and then some pay! Can't wait to see the rest of the season!
B000002AZ8|3.0|Vitalogy was the first Pearl Jam album, where I knew most of the songs from live shows and demos, before the album was released.  \\"Already in Love\\", which was retitled \\"Satans Bed\\" on the album, was a featured song from their Atlanta show, which was broadcast over the radio. They absolutely butchered the song on the Vitalogy version.  They overproduced the hell out of it and stripped the song of all its luster.  \\"Betterman\\", which was \\"Better Man\\" on Vitalogy, was a song that Pearl Jam had been playing for YEARS prior to the album. Just like Satan's Bed, they stripped this song of the raw emotion and life that they used to infuse into it with the live shows.  Ditto goes for \\"Three Days\\", which was titled \\"Last Exit\\" on Vitalogy.<br /><br />This album, despite being ridiculously overproduced, was still a better than average album.  \\"Corduroy\\" was a song that I hadn't heard live previously, and it's without question, the best song on the album.  \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" is also an excellent song, that's much better studio than live.  \\"Nothingman\\" is a great song as well, and \\"Immortality\\", despite being a little repetitive, is a good song as well.<br /><br />Overall, definitely a good, not great album.  Pearl Jam absolutely knocked it out of the park with \\"No Code\\", which followed this album.  Vitalogy for me, anyway, was a mistake that went a little awry.  The raw songs that Vitalogy was made from, were beautiful gemstones, that Pearl Jam stripped and overpolished, resulting in an uneven effort. And never again, in Pearl Jam's history, did you ever see them over-polish a song ever again.  They learned from their mistakes.  And it all traces back to this album.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app is very easy to read and I love how detailed it is. Especially when it comes to rain,  snow and ice. It's nice to know about how much to expect.
1452110581|5.0|This book was more of a &#34;gag&#34; gift for my daughter for Christmas, she has been tagged the &#34;Crazy Cat Lady&#34;. I purchased this book along with &#34;How you can tell if your cat is plotting to kill you&#34; for her Boyfriend. They both loved and read the books the same night I they received them. Everyone totally enjoyed these books which have now become the perfect coffee table accessories!
B000W94FE6|5.0|Anyone intrigued by happiness and the pursuit of happiness as mentioned in our constitution will find the insights carefully explained in this fine book 'right on the money.' I like the way all the notes and references where concisely provided at the end. And those references we see in most technical writing are not in the content of this book. This mitigates the distractions and makes the read itself a flow experience.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love animals, so this book being told from the perspective of a dog hit home with me.  The story revolves around the racing circuit which I knew nothing about, but that did not distract from the story at all.  I won't say any more because I don't want to give away the plot or the ending, but most people would enjoy this life story, especially if they like dogs!
B001IMFHVG|5.0|I have not actually watched this yet but i heard a CD of it from the library.  (That CD was stolen and they stopped producing it so I can only hope this DVD captures the phenomenon of Rubinstein's performance of the Chopin Polonaise.  When you listen you would swear he has to be an octopus to be able to play all those notes.)  I love Rubinstein from listening to recordings of various concerti by Rachmaninov but this performance  of Chopin is beyond belief.  I can't wait to watch his hands.
0762439009|4.0|I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift because he loves The Big Lebowski!  He loves it and thought it was hilarious, and you can't beat the price.
0525952926|5.0|This book takes a little getting back into at the beginning, if it's been awhile since you read the first one of the trilogy (like me), but there's a great list of all the characters, along with their relationships listed.  Plus, there's enough background included that you're reminded of who those people all were.  The story moves right along, and gives us a realistic look at &#34;how it was&#34; then, in my opinion.  I like learning some history I didn't know, without just the dry facts, like a history book.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This app was good but it came out late for the amazon app store. You could have had it for years with an ipod
B006LSZECO|2.0|I must say, until the last two chapters, I just loved this book. It's dark, twisting and turning in all the right places, keeping you guessing with each turn of the page. The ending sucks. There is no better word. I was prepared to give it five stars, and couldn't justify knocking it down to one because it is well written and very intriguing. However, it left me feeling dirty and frustrated. It will definitely stay with me, but for all the wrong reasons. :(
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read several books that described out of body experience, but Dr Alexander has explained in greater detail than any other book I have ever read
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|Awesome movie at a great price. I wish all movies were this great of a deal. Sure beats the $12+ at the box office AND I own it and can watch it as often as I like.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was good from the get go. This is one book I will read for a second time and I do not normally read books twice. I have recommended this book to several friends.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Funny movie! Not just for holiday viewing! Great movie as just a treat for the family! Worth the money! Purchase this one!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app can awaken anybody up. Not joking you can be a heavy sleeper and put math problems on here and it wakes your brain up and lets your day start off right. you can make it quiet and increase the volume and doesnot make you get up felling like you are about to scream cause it just woke you up from a good part. If you want to start a day right and not listen to radio music to wake you up get this app because it aloes you to chose your own music and espically with a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband and wife can listen to the music to awaken. you hate seeing the same boring old Color before you go to bed you can change the Colorado and Tada a new Colorado for the moring. I will always keep this app no matter what.
B0063IH60K|4.0|enjoy it especially being able to play others it helps pass the time almost anywhere you have free time and need something to do.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|Not automatically recognized in Linux Mint 14. Although, Windows 7 default auto connect is 100Mb, it is possible to force the Windows driver into gigabit duplex mode. With forced gigabit mode the device was more sensitive to ethernet cable quality. At gigabit speed it didn't like my crossover cable. A good quality straight through cat 6 cable worked fine at gigabit speed. I am getting roughly at best 50MB actual transfer speed, which is about 2 to 3 times faster.
0307719219|3.0|I know this is not an accurate assessment of the contents of the book, but I couldn't get past the terribly-bound pages. When a book is a gift, one wants it to be perfectly presented. After 2 attempts to rectify, I gave the book &#34;as is&#34;. I have not yet received a review of its contents; I personally would not give it again sight unseen.
B00004TDTO|5.0|this was the scariest move I'd ever seen as a kid, I sill cant go to the ocean without thinking about JAWS. the condition of the movie was great and received in a timely manner. I couldn't bet the cost and would an will order again.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|Can't say enough about this movie.  Just buy it, you won't regret it.  Incredible acting and I wasn't prepared for such an intense and moving plot.  This movie challenged me on many levels.  There's only one note I would make- It seems the character has more Autism than Aspergers...but I don't think that distinction hurts the film at all.  Check it out!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|There was great acting and all the old timers joining up for another movie was really cool to watch. I will watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Loved it!!!!! I would definitely read it again and I absolutely can not wait to read the next one.
1616284382|5.0|This book was really heavy and beautiful. Great coffee table book. I bought it as a christmas gift and my friend loved it. She's a huge snow white fan.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Love the cute theme and story. Tina of fun all ages can enjoy. I play on lunch during work and can't believe how time flies. If you're looking for something fun and different, give this a shot!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|First quarter of book sometimes slow but important to setting up remainder of story. Majority of story revealed young Pi's courage, ingenuity and spirituality in the face of many life and death situations. He displayed admirable and intelligent character beyond his years. A good read for teens and adults.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|The research on this book is truly amazing.  A must read!  The faithful and enlightened will enjoy this instant classic.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This was an awesome ending to an awesome series. Loved it so so much and I'm sad it's over now.
B001Q2RXJC|5.0|After listening to only a few songs from this CD I though that it was really good especially after never hearing this band before!
B0056031VY|5.0|Received the movie on time.  The blu ray quality is great.  The movie itself is very moving and just a really great story.
0061906220|5.0|My toddlers loved this book right away.  My 3yro loves to sing along and fill in the storyline.  My wife and I also enjoy the book.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This has turned into a pleasant surprise. Reliable, accurate, plays the music I choose,a most pleasant and easy to use application.
B006O6F932|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and it was easy enogh for her to assemble herself. We love the Monster High collection, and recommend it to anyone!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|When a book takes the reader on journey through 3 or 4 decades it can be challenging,  Restless is more of an engrossing puzzle, with spies and intrigue and mystery.  Go ahead give it a read.<br />I would love this to be a movie or a Masterpiece Theater series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat! Wish these books would go on forever- almost dint want the book to end.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Really good book  it's the best book I've ever read<br /><br />You should get the other books in the series to
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I like this back pack for my DSLR cam... its easy to carry and take pictures while the bag is on you unlike the conventional bags which are pretty huge for DSLR cam's. I can carry the entire kit (multiple lenses) with me of very easy where ever I go.. I would recommend to all.
B005Q4CM0Q|5.0|I recieved my package quickly and with more than enough time before Christmas. Disc was in perfect shape and it worked! I was definitely grateful for the DVD case's condition. No scratches at all.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I just love the game so much .... at some parts it can get herd but you never want to put it down! even though it is 99 cents u still need to get it!
B00005JPS8|3.0|I was sort of expecting the DVD's advertised cover sleeve to come along with it, but didn't recieve it. The DVD case had a lot of scratches but the disc was fine.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|True Jody Picoult fashion.  A gripping tale of love.  It's a book that once you begin you cannot put down.  An intense but very well written story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lots of fun &amp; not required to spend your own money to get the extra stuff to make it more interesting
1423140591|4.0|We have tried for the past three years to find a book my son would pick up and read.. WE DID IT! He not only read it, he begged for the whole series. These books read to the logical, realistic mind but add that great bit of adventure every boy is looking for.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|From the first time I played this game I have been hooked.  I haven't even taken time to read the book I purchased yet.  It is so much fun, I hate to quite playing it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I watched them all - devoured them in a day. I have ordered the second season and am already anticipating the 3rd.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I liked this album.  I purchased it on a whim without looking the band up, just listening to the sample plays in Amazon.  It was good listening on a mellow day.
0786711647|5.0|This is one of the best suspense novels ever. Creepy, tough to figure out and exciting. Good characterizations, including the murderer.<br /><br />I'd put it on my top ten list for suspense novels.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Looks &amp; works great.  Wish it had auto portrait/landscape option and the ability to make corrections to history/tally. I chose another calculator app with these important features.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Totally happy with this product!  It exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone.  It also shipped very quickly.  Thanks!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|If this app came on your phone only your carrier can decide if you can remove it or not. Sprint did not preload this app on my phone. I chose to download and use it. I found I could move the app to the SD card on my phone. It works just fine there. I play music stored on my SD card far more than the stuff on my cloud drive. I like this app. I don't like reviews that rate apps down for issues caused by choices made by carriers.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Totally happy with this product!  It exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone.  It also shipped very quickly.  Thanks!
B008J1QFLU|5.0|This is a wonderful set!!  The remastering of the actual cycle is the best yet.<br />The supplementary materials are great as well.  I am a devoted reader of Gramophone magazine and the fact that they have put in the Gramophone reviews of these recordings is spectacular!!  The best part of all is the blu ray disk which contains the entire cycle. Navigating on the blu ray is easy and one can bring up a track list.  Therefore it is not hard to get to whatever part of the cycle you wish.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|homeland is a very good show. i just wish showtime would post the shows to watch on Amazon sooner after it has aired. I'm willing to pay for it. Other shows I watch post the next day.
B007SGM084|1.0|I enjoyed reading all three of the book.  I have not read any books for over 15 years and they held my interest to the point I didn't want to put it down.  Is there going to be any more in this series?
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|THIS IS ANOTHER GAME MY SON HAS PLACED ON MY KINDLE I LIKE THE GAME  IT ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ONE
B003O86FMW|4.0|A nonstop read<br /><br />Finished it in record time, so many twists and turns my head was spinning.  I cannot wait till I can read the next book, mockingly.
B005HSL626|5.0|i love this game my son told me about it so i tried it and now i play it often
B000L53D4O|5.0|My little nephew likes anything he can push and play music so this was just great!!!<br />He played with it all day long on Christmas Day!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LIKE THE WAY IT IS SET UP SO I CANJUST TYPE IN THE CHAPTER IWANT AND IT GOES TO ITAND I CAN USE THE AUDIBLE ALSO
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is completly fine. but when it comes to the players and the live chat lets just put it this way I wouldnt let my child play with the chat options on. Someone really should be able to monitor and block people out.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|I REALLY WANTED THIS GAME ON MY KINDLE BUT I COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK SO I WILLL TRY IT AGAIN
B0096DZKZC|4.0|All in All it keeps me a little busy. my controls act funny from time to time. If you have children 5-7 I wouldnt advise them to play just yet. but i Still and always will be a sonic lover.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LIKE TO PLAY THE CARD GAME IT HELP ME TO RELAX AFTER A STRESSFUL DAY AT WORK I LOVE IT
1591391105|3.0|Good practical advise on the mechanics of the process, felt it to be a little lacking in terms of the people building side.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|I Have seen the film before with the holiday seasons. It just struck me all of the types oi love were displayed .  I always enjoy Hugh Grants romantic episodes.  Just a likable holiday film.
B005G02RIC|5.0|Not only did I like the opera but also the additional Bonus Features with some of the best opera arias. Very good buy indeed.
1419705849|5.0|Our 12 year old loves this series.  He now has them all.  This one he took out while on christmas break and almost read the whole thing.  Nice to see them reading when not required to
B000ZM1MGE|4.0|The author captures all too well the tragedy and lost opportunity that characterized the life of Brad Davis. The subject left a slim body of work as an actor, having wasted his life and died young as a result of substance abuse and self-indulgent hard living. But his (unfulfilled) promise as an artist is clear from what acting he left behind both in movies and in TV. All very sad -- but gripping, nevertheless.
075640407X|5.0|One of my favorite books. Bought as a Christmas gift and a beautiful new book! Very fairly priced as well.
B006H4DBA4|3.0|... but mine wasnt met in this story. It wasn't bad by any means - but it's just okay. And I seem to expect more than okay from Kinsella.
B008DF04J6|5.0|Substantial grooviness from beginning to end.  Rafael (another reviewer) used some of the same adjectives I'd choose:  elegant, sophisticated and majestic.  I've been a fan from the beginning - this is definitely one of my favorites from the most classy Maestro Dimitri. Occasional returns to early mixes feels like `home' while an overall feeling of cleanliness and freshness is achieved...Timeless...Absolutely gorgeous!  Many heartfelt thanks, Monsieur Dimitri - your contribution makes this life even that much better.  Dance On!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book completely surprised me. My expectations weren't overwhelming to begin with - although I had seen the raving reviews. But I could hardly stop reading it once I got started. Very well-written and well-thought-out. READ IT!
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Even using my TV's speakers only, the sound is still sweet and live. The picture of video is also clear. Good for the collection.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A stubborn man can frustrate you - but sometimes he may also be exactly what you need. Kelly has written a great story which you will love, for sure!
B001R60ESE|5.0|The sound quality is awesome. Especially for the section with emmanuel, it is great. Strongly recommend to see that section. You can find it on youtube.
0061438294|2.0|If you have read any body language books before, this book will not add too much additional insight.  Very basic and the majority of the time he gives real life examples to cases he &#34;broke.&#34;  Not highly recommended, but the book has value to first time readers on the subject.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was interesting and fun to read.  It brought back so many memories and got me to look up some of the older things that I might have forgotten over the years.  I read it to the very end.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Dumb and Vulgar Movie......<br />Mathew McConaughy always been my favorite, just terrible.<br /><br />My husband picked this movie and even he said SHUT IT OFF
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Okay I am obsessed with the idea of the Zombie Apocalypse but now I am so ready!!!! Bring it on!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good story line, great graphic and keeps me playing. too bad you have to buy the whole game after you are sucked in.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't stop reading!! Will definitely be ready more of Nicholas Sparks books!! It wasn't your ordinary romance..read it and you won't be disappointed :)
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Great movie both blu ray and DVD but the UltraViolet copy doesn't work in Canada. Contacted the copy for support and they wouldn't give me an anwser on why it wasn't working. They would only keep sending instructions on how it's supposed to work even though I replied saying your program says not avaliable in this region. If you are buying it for the UltraViolet and don't live in the US don't bother just buy a copy without it because it will not work.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is really helpful to have on any mobile device. It is great for many things and comes in handy. If your child forgets his or her calculator at school it comes in handy to have this app. I love it I use it a lot.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Enjoyed watching this movie. I read the book and was looking forward to the movie. I am looking forward to seeing the other ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That was one of the most beautiful works of literature I've ever read. I laughed, I cried and I will never forget
B00AAX68HG|3.0|Fun game and you have to think to plan out your moves, but with only 3 levels, it only gets 3 stars.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I always loved the classic movie growing up but had never really  it. The wizard of oz was the first book i read on  My kindle and it wasawesome!!!! I can't get over how different it is from the movie! Frank l Baum was the  genious!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Kids might like it, too many long drawn out chase scenes - felt like they where padding the movie to draw it out & fill the minutes...<br />Lots of fighting, more than Ice Age 1 & 2 - so not a good movie for small children.  Parents will enjoy the comedy moments too.
B004T0E2S8|1.0|THERE'S NOT EVEN A FEET BOARD ITS JUST THE NOTES<br /><br />I'm a real beginner as in I just started playing about a week ago and I`'ve been using tabs with the FRET board
B009HELT3C|3.0|Good fun movie with some violence.  Just as good as MiB 1 & 2, but fully played out - I hope they don't make a MiB 4.  No music interesting enough to buy after the movie.  Great period time travel movie - parents will get a kick out of seeing the good-old-days brought back to life.  Some sad moments, not a good film for small kids.
0440244412|5.0|I love Karen Marie Moning.  This series was a little different from what I normally read, but the story was interesting and I was drawn in by the characters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Collins is a great writer. Couldn't put it down because I was always wondering what was going to happen next!
B00080ZG1A|5.0|Leonardio Decaprio was fabulous in this role. He brought Howard Hughes to life, and did a great job in showing the audience what is like for Hughes living with OCD. I was rooting for him during the Senate hearings! Very believable performance. That was Oscar worthy.
1577314808|5.0|I am defying the book by taking time to reflect on it!  Seriously, this book is profound in it's teaching.  Try reading it without walking away with new techniques for enjoying the current moment!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is extremely fun and entertaining! It gives you goals, prizes, and multiple power boosts to aim and work for. It helps past the time and is one of the greatest games I've played for Kindle Fire.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Mad Men continues to be one of the best shows on TV. The storylines and the acting are all top notch.
0307943232|3.0|I liked this book. I haven't read a John Grisham for ages so I was looking forward to this. I wanted an audio book to listen to while I'm at the gym so this had an engaging plot line and the narration is mostly good. Until he mispronounced Antigua, I was really enjoying it. The island of Antigua is pronounced ANN-TEE-GAH (the \\"u\\" is silent). He kept saying \\"ANN-TEE-GWA\\" so I got irritated and had to finish it by reading the Kindle version. Other than that cringe inducing factor, it's a good book.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I'm a weather junkie and this app really works well on my original Kindle Fire and my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD. This past Fall my Mama went on a leaf trip to New England and she called me each evening to get the forecast for the town they were visiting the next day. This weather app got it right all 10 days of the trip.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|I am a long time Total Recall movie lover. I was skeptical that it would not be as good as the first, but it was. I would have liked to see a bit more dialogue, but overall good/
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was one of the best series of stories I have read in a long time! These stories held my interest and kept me reading late into the night. I'm looking forward to reading the next one! 5 stars from me!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i sit around and play this game for hours upon hours but there's one problem. The kindle version is updated after the ios! curently we are on the new york update but the kindle dosent have it. Update faster for 5 stars
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I realize that Peeta and Katniss were forced back into the arena, I couldn't hardly put the book down!  Now I can't wait to begin the last book.  You'll be surprised with this one....it has a twist!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This trilogy reads as if a teenager wrote it. I am not an eye roller, but did find myself rolling my eyes a lot during the constant reference to calling each other Mr. and Mrs. Grey constantly, her biting her lip, the constant sex as if they they have to do it every hour, and can't leave out the 'oh my Fifty Shades' comments by 'Mrs. Grey'. I regret buying the trilogy, would have stopped before finishing the first but oh well, already owned them on my Kindle.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of the series, but I definitely like this one the most. The all-star cast did a good job playing their roles, it had lots of action, & the story line was solid.
B000VOC90Y|3.0|This bag is a really great bag. I love the pockets and space provided, however it barely fits my 17&#34; Asus Republic of Gamers laptop (which is the reason I bought this bag). It barely closes if I put the laptop directly in the back pocket instead of using the laptop sleeve provided. However aside from this detail (and I realize my laptop may be bigger than the average 17&#34; since its a gaming laptop, so I let it slide) everything about the bag is great!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I liked Charlize's character, but was bored with the other cast members. I think that I fell asleep during the movie.

B006964E8S|5.0|great book as all his are recommended reading  hes a great writer and you never know what the endings going to be  keeps you guessing good stuff
0843189673|5.0|I used these books to give each of my ELA 6th grade students a simple text to help them understand character traits. With some of the books, we also discussed the author's craft to show how the character changed from the beginning of the book to the end. Students then used the information they collected to grow theories about the characters and designed character maps.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I've seen the series but have only scratched the surface of the walking dead comic world. I am for sure going to be reading the rest of them.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I'm so torn by how I feel overall about this book.  On one hand - I LOVED IT!  On the other hand - it's disturbing how dysfunctional and unhealthy of a relationship Travis and Abby (aka Pigeon) have.  If I had a friend or family member attempting a relationship with a guy such as this I would tell her to RUN.  Anyone completely and totally dependent upon another person for their every moment of happiness is a disaster waiting to happen - well duh on the title, huh?  But that's the real world....so in the fictional world, their constant fighting, and making up, and fighting again, and making up again, over and over, shampoo, rinse, repeat...works.<br /><br />I was pulled in to the emotions of both characters.  I couldn't understand how if Abby was trying so hard to stay away from her past, why on earth she was willing to support Travis in the fighting, which also consists of gambling.  Not only is the fighting dangerous, but that's gotta be illegal on some level, and not productive towards his Criminal Justice degree.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, they have crazy love for one another.  Whether you understand their strange relationship or not, they have a connection that they have never been found with anyone else, (and Travis should know being the man whore of Eastern).  And I gotta say, when you find The One, that is EXACTLY how it is.  You just know.  You work through the kinks and you mess up a lot, but your love conquers over the problems you face.  From that perspective of the book, I wholeheartedly agree!<br /><br />Meet Travis and understand why I love him - \\"He oozed sex and rebelliousness with his buzzed brown hair and tattooed forearms...\\"<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br />\\"I'm not impressed with your tattoos or your boyish charm or your forced indifference...\\"<br /><br />\\"I didn't know how most girls felt around him, but I'd seen how they behaved.  I was experiencing more of a disoriented, nauseated feeling than giggly infatuation...\\"<br /><br />\\"It's hard to forget you're behind me when your thighs are squeezing the life out of me.\\"<br /><br />\\"You should know by now that it takes patience and a forgiving attitude to be friends with Travis.  He's his own universe.\\"<br /><br />\\"Abs?  What are you, a workout video?\\"<br /><br />\\"You like Pigeon...it's a dove, an attractive girl, a winning card in poker, take your pick.  You're my Pigeon.\\"<br /><br />\\"Whatever was going on with him, he needed me near him, and I couldn't have objected even if I'd wanted to.\\"<br /><br />\\"I had died and woken up in High School Musical.\\"<br /><br />\\"...all I need is you.  You're all I think about.  You're all I dream about.  You're all I want.\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't care what you were, or what you're not anymore.  I just want you.\\"<br /><br />\\"I didn't know I was lost until you found me.\\"<br /><br />\\"I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed.\\"<br /><br />These last 2 quotes sum up very well Travis and Abby's relationship:<br /><br />\\"Fighting, laughing, loving, or crying...I was where I wanted to be.\\"<br /><br />\\"...crazy is exactly the way I like it...\\"<br /><br />Check out these two crazy people who will get under your skin with their incessant fighting, and then have you gushing over their amazing conquering love.<br />4.3 starsard to forget you're behind me when your thighs are squeezing the life out of me.\\"<br /><br />\\"You should know by now that it takes patience and a forgiving attitude to be friends with Travis.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this game its addictive and humorous, a must play for all.  It provocateurs of fun and ingenious strategy.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, while an entertaining (but not as great as it should have been) movie for Halo Fans leaves those unfamiliar with the series puzzled and confused.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />The story is set on a distant planet before the arrival of the Covenant. It opens with personal interviews of young &#34;cadets&#34; that are in training to join the UNSC and their struggles in training. Near the later half of the movie, the covenant invades and begins slaughtering the entire academy, save a handful of cadets.<br /><br />Master Chief and a couple other &#34;Spartans&#34; were deployed to defeat the Covenant in an attempt to rescue these handful of cadets.<br /><br />The end of the movie is up to you to see, but there are a few critiques I have with the film:<br /><br />1) Post-production was not what I expected for a Halo film. It was a bit on the cheap side.<br />2) Actor jobs were tolerable, though not great.<br />3) Most importantly, I'm sure fans would have liked to see a different story line other than what was presented.<br /><br />In sum, if you're a Halo fan you'll like it. If you're not, I wouldn't bother.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great Movie. Not as detailed as the book but the movies never ever. Can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The Bourne Legacy follows the plot of another &#34;program candidate&#34; and offers us a side-stepped story into the Jason Bourne story.<br /><br />However, the movie often comes up wanting -- while Jeremy Renner does a great job in the movie, perhaps, the screenplay is not quite as strong as the other films in the series.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|ever. love all the twlight movies and books. so sad that the series is over. Wish they could go on forever.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I love this movie --<br /><br />My wife and I were skeptical at first that it would appeal to adults who were staying in on the weekend, but there's tons of entertainment in there for all ages. And, it's a beautiful story.<br /><br />Definitely recommend whether you're a kid or adult and are looking for a good movie for the weekend!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Funnest movie I have seen in a while. The bear is so funny. I had abs after watching this movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really love this book. Chbosky really lets you into the mind of Charlie. Being the complete opposite of a wallflower myself I have always loved reading this book and understanding what someone like Charlie really feels. I think that this book is absolutely beautiful and deep and it takes me into a world with great characters. Everyone should reach this book.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|So sexy. Love watching it. I think my husband gets jealous. Everytime I watch it he asked &#34; How many times are you going to watch that. &#34;
B007FJFDXS|2.0|i uninstalled, it was fun for about 10 minutes and after a while it just gets boring since its way too easy..
0316134082|5.0|Great Book. I collected tll the collector editions. Comes with a nice cover that keeps book for getting messed up.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I'd like to start off by saying that Colleen Hoover is a great writer. She's proven this in both Slammed and its sequel Point of Retreat. Hopeless is another well written novel from one of the great writers to come out of the Indie world. Yet, it's not the only thing that makes a book. There are a few aspects to \\"great writing\\" and while a lot of it was great for this book, some things fell flat.<br /><br />I know all books can't be the fast reads that make reading almost effortless and the story unfold before the reader's eyes. It's just that the flow of Hopeless didn't go all that smoothly at times. I enjoyed having the flashback chapters. I enjoyed the fact that Sky's younger voice was used for most of these. Despite this, I feel it disrupted me as I was reading along. It wasn't just the flashbacks either. Overall I feel the book was a bit sluggish for at least the first half, if not until around 60%. Again, books don't already have to excite the reader right away, I get that. But once the story picked up, it seems like too much of what was established in the first half was just tossed aside. Due to the nature of the events of this book, it's understandable to move on with the plot, (I'll be a bit vague here as to avoid spoilers as much as I can) but there were two characters that had barely a mention after certain point. When they were brought up again, it only seemed out of minor consideration that they'd be worried, then they go away again.<br /><br />There were also a few more things that irked me; things that seemed to be forgotten and left unsolved. Again, I won't say too much. It's really hard not to add spoilers this time around so I just won't attempt to skirt around things. Bottom line, I still had questions about various aspects of the book. And some other things just hit me the wrong way...and I'm very liberal when it comes to what's in books. Nothing really can get to me.<br /><br />With all that said about what I didn't really care for in the book, there were many great things to mention. There are issues brought up in this book that might be hard to stomach for some readers, especially women (men, as well; don't get me wrong). Yet, while it might be hard to read about it, I think it's great that someone might be able to find some help by seeing how a character deals with a similar situation. While the events were played out in a slightly unrealistic fashion, ways to cope could be taken away from the story. So in that sense the book was great.<br /><br />The book also set up most of the characters very well, and took a good amount of time to do so. I feel this lead to the sluggish start of the book, as well. The setting and description put me in each and every moment of the story. As I said in the beginning, Hoover is a great writer. She knows her stuff. This is the reason why I DID enjoy the story. It's also the reason why I'm torn between full enjoyment and questioning more things than I'd like to.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book to other readers? Absolutely. Already, the day after I've finished it, it has sparked discussion with some friends of mine. I've been able to talk to them and pick it apart piece by piece and find understanding of a few more questions here and there. In the end, that is what a great book should do. A book should make readers think and come back to the book later on in discussion.<br /><br />So did I have issues with Hopeless? Well, yes, yes I did. But did I throw it in a fire like some readers might just for disagreeing with some stuff? No. It wasn't a bad book in any sense or the word.<br /><br />I'd really like to see where Hoover goes from here.there were many great things to mention.

0345529057|5.0|My friend told me about this series. So I bought them and I love it. Great books. Def recommand. ..
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I play american mahjong regularly, know the tiles  and thought this would be similar game.  It's not. It's like the old card game &#34;concentration&#34;, matching up pairs. Had to figure how to play the game because there were no clear rules/instructions. Still can't figure out some of the rules based on the level and formation of the tiles.  Can be frustrating!
0062218867|5.0|This is a marvelous book.  The story is timely with questions of who is \\"worthy\\" of human rights while still having the outrageous Pratchett wit. How often do you read a book where you laugh out loud regularly and want to read bits to anyone nearby?<br />Working from the inner dialogue of Sam Vines offers a large palette of story colors with which to paint.<br />I listened to THUMP as an audiobook this summer while traveling and this was a perfect follow up.<br />He is a genius and I love his style.<br />This is a disjointed review, but, so what?
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The $5.00 I paid for the digital copy of this moving soundtrack was well worth it for as many times as I have played it! The album is constantly on repeat and the biggest highlights from the movie are in it. It is only noticably missing &#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34;. But, you can hardly blame the producers for not putting the entire thing on the soundtrack or why would there be motivation to go and see the film?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book.could not put it down..didn't see the twist coming. A quick read and appeals to a wide range of readers
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|It's sleek, comfortable, and just sexy. Everything I could want in a gaming mouse and I didn't have to break the bank for it. I love it. Fits my hand perfectly. No issues what-so-ever. I think I can honestly say it's the best mouse I've ever bought. Didn't come with a driver CD, but no biggie, got the driver and software from the anker site. Glad I bought this mouse
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I thought this book was alright. It held my attention but predictable. I would read other books by this author though.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|I love all these songs. But where is 'do you hear the people sing'? I mean is that not one of the main songs of the film?<br />Its repeated through out the film and at least seems to me that this song is like the heart of the movie. I wish they would add it.
0792844890|5.0|This is probably the worst of the Mel Brooks classics, but given that Brooks is the best comedy film maker of all times, this is still obviously a great movie, and a must for any collector.
1594200106|5.0|Just lovely. Evokes a forgotten world. Glad to be part of it of it for a while. Looking forward to the others in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read the first one a few months back so I went back and reread it before reading this one. I think it was a good progression. It amazes me how short of a time period all of that stuff happens! I am looking forward the next one!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|An entertaining and fun story. The character, Arthur Christmas, is so endearing to yound and old- we just want to hug him and help him out in his endeavor.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a delicious read! I could not stop turning the pages.  Several of my dearest friends have adopted foster children and sharing their &#34;journey of parenting&#34; with them has made me sensitive to the specific needs and challenges of children who are wounded by life's circumstances.  It is quite obvious that Vanessa Diffenbaugh knows this journey well.  Elizabeth's ability to draw firm, clear lines of behavioral expectations and also to unconditionally love and love and love is an inspiration to any reader and surely a blessing to the foster child, Victoria, in this novel.<br /><br />An added bonus is all that I learned about flowers and what they symbolize.  It was also extraordinary to &#34;watch&#34; Victoria -  who as one of my adopting mom friends says -  &#34;Hides sad with mad&#34;  and see how eventually Victoria  can go deep inside herself and let flowers express what she cannot find words to say.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have called this review &#34; The Language of Flowers and A Homecoming&#34;....because if there were a few words that I would have to always remember, they  would be Elizabeth's plea near the novel's end.....&#34;...come home.&#34;  And the visual image would be baby Hazel's sticky hand between Elizabeth's and Victoria's clasped hands....Hmmm, love wins.....<br /><br />In the end, one also learns a new language of flowers and learns how the heart can be moved regardless of what language love is spoken or &#34;arranged&#34; in.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|I think it's the gentlest of re-masters.  I usually cringe when I hear &#34;re-master&#34; because studios just bump up the audio levels for kids and their cheap stereos. Don't worry about it, this is great.  It comes over Amazon's MP3 service just fine.<br /><br />Now as far as the music, it's spectacular, most of the iconic songs are here.<br />For a more varied approach, you'll just have to get used to buying more of their albums that are not in a collection.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe is amazing, great music, great guitar player, and great DVD. Now I can't wait to see Joe Bonamassa live.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|lots of action and funny it was cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool I think I will guy it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a very enjoyable tale. Well written, humorous, and intelligent. This one reminded me of short stories written back in the day by the likes of Asimov, Heinlein, Harry Harrison, and others. Well done!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Wish it were more appropriate for a younger audience. But very very funny. Enjoyable for many ages but has quite a few sexual jokes.
B0086700CM|5.0|Kids enjoy trying to see who can get the farthest and collect the most coins. I find this game frustrating but addictive. Great way to pass the time away..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed. would recommend. I like playing games like these and can't wait to play some of the other titles g5 has to offer.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written story which was difficult to put down, however the content was disturbing to me.  I read it for a book club and it wouldn't be my typical choice of book.
B000000HX0|5.0|I gave this to a very dear friend for Christmas.  It was his favorite gift.  The album was brand new with no creases and the sound was great. It was delivered quickly as well.  Thanks!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|First, the rating of 5 stars is not a reflection of the quality of the story or characters. It is more a reflection of my missed opportunities to clearly redefine the battle of good vs evil in my own life. To some readers, this will seem like a minor and insignificant point, but I feel that it is this point that defines the entire story. Ironically, the missed opportunities also make it eerily realistic. Leaving that very distinction unclear convicted me in a way. Hunger Games or no? Vengeance or forgiveness? I suppose a 4-star rating is a rebellious act of defiance because I can't answer either question without doubting my own true nature and it leaves me unsettled so I changed it to 5-star. Read this book and think about where you would stand. I  wanted the storybook ending of \\"everyone lives happily ever after\\"--so I didn't feel so dirty cheering for vengeance. Evoking that kind of emotion is brilliant!
B000H30B3G|5.0|It was a gift and my nephew loved it. The extened 30 min was awesome. It was well worth the price. Which I got for a great deal.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Hilarious movie. Reminded me of the akwardness and seemingly serious nature I took everything as a youth. Loved Bill Murray and Ed Norton. 5 stars
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This is the first place for the girls to kiss a few boys and p.s.the girl is so sexy right now and the girls were in the first place for you should of kissed her Greg
B005K0HDGE|5.0|good, better best of King's more recent novels.  Nothing beats Salem's Lot or The Stand, however this comes close to them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read. Both books gave been great. Now I need to see the movie. I would highly recommend these books.
B00006LFGD|5.0|l have always enjoyed her music and this cd is now one of my favorites.  she has a voice that is timeless and very easy to listen to.  She picked perfect people to do the duets with, can't say that there is any songs i did not enjoy
B003JHKORK|5.0|I love how it is portable to use and it is very fast! it is awesome! I can watch it at the library with my friends at lunch.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|In This Moment rocks! LOVE the vocals. They are going somewhere fast. Look out competition, this girl is on fire.
0440422973|4.0|If so, this is the book for you!  A very funny tale of the secret desire of many of us overwhelmed by the relentless crush of holiday expectations to enjoy a tropical holiday instead.  The story has unexpected turns and twists to keep it interesting, plus plenty of hilarity and a little poignancy to touch you.  Enjoy it with a warm drink on a cold night!
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Seemed like they started to run out of money halfway through so they ended it. I think they could have done much better.
157421327X|5.0|I chose this as a gift for someone I thought would enjoy learning Zentangle - I read it first and loved it!
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Yes, the premise is dumb, but if you are any fan of Family Guy and understand why that is funny, you will LOVE this movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is made well and I recommend it for anyone who needs a calculator. It is free which makes it better!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a fun game. With great looking locations and fun puzzles, 3 different levels of play, there is<br />is something for everyone here. Maybe a bit short but I will go back and play it again on the other modes! :-)
B008QTVNUI|4.0|My review is based on only the first episode of the first season and so is quite incomplete.  I am deciding whether to watch more.  Homeland is a variation of the old cat-and-mouse plot which can be quite suspenseful but may grow wearisome when dragged out over a long time.  I think the acting by Lewis and Danes is first-rate and is the reason I'll probably watch more of the series.<br />Damian Lewis is an actor who really inhabits his roles and can make a complete change of persona believable as he does in the &#34;Much Ado About Nothing&#34; segment of &#34;Shakespeare Retold.&#34;  I also liked his performance in the TV detective series &#34;Life.&#34;
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Nicholas Sparks' book provide are stories of real life where people have problems and not every thing is picture perfect.  They are full of warmth and down to earth meaning
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Works great and it is easy to use!  Did not have to think to much.  Made playing so easy to watch and enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a very different book than what I normally read but good. It was a nice change of pace.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really good book. I couldn't quit reading!! One of the best books I've read in a long time! I loved it!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|great game to pass the time, love how the kids play and show off when they get all the needed stars...
B0085BHHOS|5.0|Britney Spears is AMAZING!!! This is a great CD!! PERFECT!! GREAT!!! I Want more!!!! MOre!! and More!!! Awesome CD, I completly enjoy it.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This has worked perfectly for our kindle fire hd.  I have a 3 and 6 year old using this and it has kept it clean for one, but it also makes it easier for the kids to hold.  I like having the case as well when holding the kindle.  fits well, keeps it nice.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|First night of vacation it was great to lie in bed and watch a great movie, great picture sound and an all around great movie
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I hats it never liked it it sucked it was boring I like the Rio one tho that one is good but this just sucked
B002ECQB46|4.0|I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Plot surprised me.  Ending was predictable but normal for Hollywood movies in the crazy stalker genre.
B007NZDES0|5.0|This live concert was AMAZING!! The stage setup was visually stunning!! Sade was in my area in 2012 and after watching this video I WISH I had taken the time to purchase tickets to see her live. Simply stunning!!! I have nothing bad to say about this video. If you can.... purchase it. You won't be disappointed!!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Colleen Hoover has an amazing talent for writing.  I think this was the most enjoyable book I have ever read.  Besides writing a good story that always surprises you, she has the ability to make you connect with the characters so fully and easily.  You really fall in love with the characters and their story.  Most importantly, you never feel like you are trying to get through her books rather you end up savoring them.  You will want to read them again!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Play the computer really sharpens my skills.  I play occasional games at home and I was loosing.  Playing the computer has increased my ability.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved Slammed and Point of Retreat, so when I saw another Colleen Hoover book I thought i'd like it.  It was so good!! Engaginging from the start with surprises and revalations throughout.  This author is so good at what she does.  Her stories are so well thought out that you feel that what you are reading is happening.  Besides for the Hunger Games series I have rarely felt like that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who doesn't love solitaire.  I find it relaxing something I can do when watching T.V. during the commercials.  I never tire of it.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Bored on a Monday afternoon, decided to watch the remake.  I've always been a huge fan of the old one, so I figured I'd give this a peek. It was good.  My opinion on a movie though, if you are going to remake something to be more updated, then update it.  The dancing, for the most part, was out of date except in the beginning of the movie.  Otherwise, well done.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles but stopped putting them together because they take up so much space.  Now I can enjoy any time I want and space is not an issue.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is simply fantastic! The main character, Charlie, is completely relatable especially to kids in high school. I give this 5 stars because this book is inspirational.
B005GU8ILW|5.0|My granddaughter asked for this for her Christmas gift. It had to be shipped from the UK so it did take a while...BUT it came when the shipper said it would. The record came in a wonderful sleeve and the record was bright orange. My granddaughter loved it!  This grandmother is going to be shopping \\"retro\\" for grandchildren now!    b+  [...]

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It took me a few episodes to get into this series but, once I did, I really liked it.  Very entertaining with dynamic and complex characters that I became very interested in.  I didn't want to miss a moment.
B006O6F932|5.0|it is a neat school house for monster high dolls. my 8 year old put it together so it is ease to put together! she loves it!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The characters are clearly defined inBook One.<br />Book 2 is just a love story .Certainly I will not read Book 3.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Great book, interesting, hard to put down!  JK Rowling has created another masterpiece.  I've already reccommended it to two friends looking for new books!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I love Bruno Mars so I couldn't wait to get his new CD.  I did the pre-purchase so that I would receive it the same day that it was released and that was awesome.  There are a couple songs that I wouldn't let my kids listen to but I love to turn it up and sing when I'm in the car alone. :)  Money well spent!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app!  Love how pictures fill the page.  Very easy like/comment, etc.  Much easier to use than the app on my phone.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This is a great book... slow read, drawn out... just like i remember.  Good ol' classic for free on the Kindle.  Who can complain?!
B001BANK32|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  Hands down, the scariest book I have ever read.  You might want to pull a Joey Tribbiani and put the book in the freezer when it gets too terrifying.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So hot loved the first book and the second can't wait for number 3  girls red these books you won't be able to put them down
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case was awful!  My phone made unbeleivable noises while in this case.  My photos came out with a foggy halo around them.  Very disappointed!
B000M52Z8I|5.0|I needed a copy of this movie for a school project & boy was it worth buying! Up to this project, I've never seen this movie before. It is a complex yet enlightening action thriller that is definitely at least worth checking out.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Another in the latest series of dark edgy action just the way the character was meant to be.  Great gizmos too.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Made for a great Christmas present for my Dad. Michael Jackson was always one of his favorite performers & this DVD is a great example of it. The DVD was brand new condition & shipped quickly. Satisfied!
B005LAJ16I|1.0|Homeland:  The Complete First Season.  This series should have been marked &#34;soft porn&#34; because of the nudity and graphic sex scenes.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I guess I'm the dummy, since this is not the first review stating some of the DVDs don't work.  I figured Amazon to be a trustworthy enough company to fix the problem after SO many other people stated the DVDs don't work, but alas, Amazon must not listen to their customers.<br /><br />DON'T BUY!  THEY DONT WORK!
B0013527I4|5.0|Gift for a loved one. The Muppet show is wonderful.  It's fun seeing stars from the past and how much they have changed.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I was hesitant to give this game 5 stars, as I thought it was a little too short. However, the game was a very fun and satisfying experience. Some of the puzzles are really challenging! There were a few scenes that really creeped me out, as well. One thing that comes to mind was when the record player was on and playing an album backwards. I really liked the storyline and the whole dollhouse concept. \\"Scary clowns\\" have never really been my horror element of choice, but I knew that was the theme before downloading this. Overall, the storyline was good and I did not see the ending coming. Great game; can't wait for the sequel.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book because I love romance a little bit of drama.<br />I couldn't put it down once I started reading.
030746363X|5.0|Everything here is fast acting and real,<br />just how real?<br /><br />Well,<br />I semi followed the slow carb diet for 3 days and exercised 1 day.<br />I'm able to see the mid sections of my abs which I havent seen in a few years.<br /><br />No, I'm not over weight. My weight is average for my height and so is my body fat. Meaning that the exercises for the abs and dropping most carbs helped to make some actual visible changes.
B0052FG750|5.0|If you are an originalist and think the only worthwhile versions of these albums are on first-edition vinyl, then please move along.  There is nothing to see here.<br /><br />However, as for me, I tossed my Doors LPs years ago (although I still have plenty of vinyl.)  I've gone through a couple of CD releases, as well.  I'd say this is the definitive mix.  Morrison is mixed down here, and Densmore, Manzarek, and Krieger, are brought up into the balance they deserve, to showcase The Doors as a great band, not just a [albeit charismatic] vocalist.<br /><br />These are truly exciting CDs, and show what CDs are capable of, here at the end of the silver disc era.  I also find these discs superior to the somewhat gimmicky DVD-Audio versions that I tried as well.<br /><br />And, the definition and clarity is so good here, that you can confirm the lyric really is &#34;I see the bathroom is clear.&#34;
0547884591|5.0|Great break down again by Ferriss,<br />just hitting the meta learning portion but so far the book has great humor and a lot of good lessons.
B00A9X7X6C|4.0|One of the better movies I've seen lately.  Like most sci-fi you can't over think the plot too much :)
B007SGM084|5.0|Great books couldn't put then down I hope to read more from this author so very glad I purchased them I will keep them on my kindle to read again
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It is a nice app but bear in mind it is geared to helping you read the Bible through. If you want a Bible to use as a Bible or study aid you really need to just buy one in book form.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|This movie always makes me laugh! It gets funnier every time I watch it. For a  &#34;B&#34; movie, this one is extremely good.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Very nice game. Liked the story line. You can enlarge all the scenes except the find the difference ones but I think the timer is adequate.
B004ZGM76A|5.0|I bought this movie looking for some fun, cartoony action. What I found was surprising depth in a movie that others had panned as being shallow and lacking. I really enjoyed this one, from the plot to the visuals to the excellent soundtrack (that Bjork song rocks!).
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Very nice piano app. Nice array of skill levels on the different songs and the labels seem to be accurate.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|I'm a huge fan of 007. Daniel Craig is right up there at the top as my favorite actors to portray Bond. Quantum is a lot of fun and is an excellent movie. Why a 4 star rather than a 5 star? I consider this to be the least of Craig's efforts in the role of Bond, and I want there to be some room to distinguish Casino Royale and Skyfall. But overall, this is a great watch and a lot of fun.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Any reader interested in life after death and open to learning about near death experiences will enjoy this book.  Written by a neurosurgeon, this book offers the closest thing to scientific evidence that we have available so far on this subject.  The book is well edited and a fast read, but thought provoking and inspirational.  Highly recommended reading.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I bought this movie thinking that it was going to be more of a comedy than anything. I realized rather quickly--and was reminded throughout the movie--that there is much more depth to this movie than a simple comedy. Excellent movie!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I am addicted to Mahjonj & have discovered I can spend way too much time playing it. just getting more comfortable using my new Kindle & playing Mahjonj is a good was to do it
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I very much enjoyed The Avengers and have watched it a few times since purchasing it. That said, it isn't a five star movie. It's definitely worth watching. Great action and special effects.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I would watch it again, it's different with some great special effects I think I enjoyed the older version better but these actors more !
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Love the packaging - very creative and a wonderful box set to be given as a gift. Great price!! :)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed it!  Hands down one of my favorite Big Fish Games!  The story line is great and the game is just plain fun.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its ok. w.slow. the rooms are dark and there are no instructions on how to expand the view. found it by accident.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|I have studied the holocaust for many years, I consider this movie to be very accurate,there were many Catholics who risk their own lives or perished in the concentrations camps for helping the Jews our brothers in faith.<br />  I really recommend this movie.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Very quiet and efficient. Installation needs some going over but once you understand what need to be done its OK.<br />Need to be armed with patience and go through the whole disassembly and reassembly of the computer.<br />Need to make sure that it will fit in the case.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|A true Pixar classic and must have in a movie collection.  Great entertainment for all ages.  My 80 year old father loved it as much as my 6 year old.
