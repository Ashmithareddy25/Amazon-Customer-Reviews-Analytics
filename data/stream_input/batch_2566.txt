B008IJT0CE|5.0|This apps works well. The sound is clear and there are a great variety of sounds combinations. I haven't found one I didn't like yet. The timing feature is great &amp; works well if you are using it to fall asleep. I would recommend it for anyone.

B003VANOFY|3.0|Edit 6-12-13:<br />The good, when it works the audio is much better both recording and listening than my previous wired headset.<br />The bad, there are a large number of Gotcha's with this headset. First you need USB 2.0 port. I have had zero luck with a USB 3.0 port. The drivers wont load, it tries over and over and over ...<br />It is highly sensitive to other wireless devices. We have several other logitech wireless devices in our home office. (2 unified mice, 1 unified keyboard, 3 different logitech mice with their own recievers, and a unified touchpad). We also have a Asus Dark Knight wireless router running tomato. In addition our wireless survey is full on almost every channel with at least low signals. The software is also slightly quirky in that is has several items that apparently can make it repeatedly crash.<br /><br />Put all that together and what do you get? If your not at all techy and just want stuff to work, you might get luck and have settings just right such that it does, or you might have any one or multiple of the above issues and your headset becomes a nightmare.<br /><br />If your techy you end up with several hours of troubleshooting, google searches, rebooting, tweaking settings, forum posts, tech support calls.<br /><br />At this moment, my headset worked for about 4 hours with only 2 resets (about 5-10 seconds each). Previously every 10-60 seconds the headset would disconnect and reconnect.<br /><br />What I did: Currently running without software installed (will install again tonight see if issue returns).<br />Tweaked several wireless settings in the Tomato router, you may find similar settings in yours if you are having issues. First I forced a wireless channel, I ended up on channel 8-9.  Other channels still had issues. Other settings in the router: Turn off Afterburner, Turned on Bluetooth Coexistence, Frame Burst: Disable, Preamble: Set to long.<br /><br />Original Review: Purchased this back on May 4th. Got it setup and working. Had no issues on my Windows 8 x64. The sound was great, mic was great, happily playing along enjoying wireless freedom.<br /><br />Fast forward to this weekend. The logitech headset is reseting every 10-60 seconds. Making sound incoming or outgoing a complete nightmare. I want to scream.<br /><br />I'm using the latest software, I've tried all the \\"tricks\\" other people who have had this problem have tried. Disabling OPENGL, reinstalling, uninstalling, deleting, reinstalling. Different USB ports (2.0 and 3.0). Moving my damn desk around, moving my wireless router (keep in mind it worked for a month with the thing right next to it, now all of a sudden this might be the cause?????)<br /><br />Skip this thing. Either its broken and needs replaced in which case it lasted what 2 months? The software has been updated and is broken and made it past QA. Either way, if you value your game time skip this device. A weekend of crappy audio and troubleshooting is worth more than I paid for this thing.<br /><br />I have submitted a helpdesk ticket. I am hunting down old versions of the software. If any of that resolves I'll update my review.Had no issues on my Windows 8 x64.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all three.  Must read them in order.  I will read them all again.  Peeta and Katniss are very strong individuals!
0060557818|5.0|Vey nice book. It´s a heavy dose of fantasy on the likes of Alice in Wonderland or Cinematically speaking feels very much like \\"Labirynth\\" (yes, the one with David Bowie). If you enjoy being immersed on an alternate reality and specially if you´ve been to London you are really going to enjoy the experience. Mind the gap! If you don´t well, maybe the \\"Gap Monster\\" will get you! Hahaha just great!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A delightful intertwining of two families with a happy ever-after expectation which of course wasn't to be. A not impossible pact shatters the lives of both families and natutally impinges on the community.

B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters are poorly developed, their conversations have little depth and the plot is slow.  The book needs a good proofreading. It has many grammatical and plot errors.  It lacks the excitement and thrill I look for in a murder mystery.<br /><br />On the plus side, there are no explicit sex scenes and very little profanity.<br /><br />I won't be reading any more of this author's books!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I had very little expectations about Jack Reacher, but was pleasantly surprised.  The movie is entertaining and will keep your interest.  Tom Cruise is a believable action hero.

B00CBRAD2A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The opening scene is simply awesome, and sets the tone for a bad-ass like Schwarznegger kicking butt for the rest of the movie.<br />Johnny Knoxville's character is really funny, and Guzman's deputy character is also enjoyable. Watch with your (probably male) friends who love cars, guns, and breaking glass. Johnny Knoxville's character is really funny, and Guzman's deputy character is also enjoyable.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Very well done movie for set and costuming, and people singing about everthing. My wife got this to watch for she and my daughter. I don't care for musicals at all so my rating is a little biased. It was hard for me to watch Gladiator and Wolverine sing through the whole show. Those who enjoy musicals will probably love this one.

B00AKKGX4W|3.0|Good book.  But, not much romance...<br />Not super exciting.  I had no problem with stop reading to do other things.
1451695195|1.0|I felt that parts of his story were inconsistent with the fact that he was trying to display. Dr. Alexander tells us that his questions are answered through thoughts, immediately. Yet when he wonders who the girl on the butterfly wing is, he does not receive an answer. This is just one example of how I was left feeling that his story was either made up or a dream. I have read other near death experiences that have left me with a positive and believable story about what heaven is really like.  You might want to consider reading Heaven is Real or Delivered. These are just two of the examples of experiences that I have read that I felt were believable and realistic accounts of heaven and hell.

B00472NZDQ|3.0|I cant say that I couldnt put this book down and am finding that I am looking for books with 'more substance' - this is just another boring court drama and very predictable I thought<br /><br />I read the whole book but for what you pay for books these days I cant say that it was money well spent
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was beyond in love with the book but so sad on how it ended and left on that note. Each page I read I fall more in love with Gideon. Can't wait till I know when this will continue and see when I can get lost with him again

I also liked the complete absence of false sentimentality, self-pity, and the &#34;cutsy&#34; elements found in so many animal books.  I would recommend the book to anybody who would like a day-brightener!  I gave it 5 stars because I totally enjoyed it, was never bored, and hope that my few sentences cause as many readers as possible to enjoy this beautiful book.<br />Carlee Marrer-Tising<br />Basel, Switzerland
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read... Seriously.  Intrigue, character development, plot twists, and masterful world building by GRRM.  For the record, I've never watched the HBO show and I knew nothing about this book when I first bought it.  But I'm already looking forward to reading all 7 books (once 6 and 7 are finished, of course).
1400052181|5.0|I loved the book so much that I often gifted it to others several times over, and had many a dinner party conversation about it.  The book tells the story of a woman whose cells long out-lived her.  Though not well known in her lifetime, cells removed from Henrietta Lacks during cancer treatment went on to be used in scientific research for several decades.  That research went on to make companies a fortune while her family lived in poverty.  So... What is \\"medical waste\\"? Do you own it after it leaves your body? Should you be entitled to part of the profits made from that 'waste'?  And if you were entitled to profits, would that slow research? Either way, there seems to be some justice in knowing Henrietta Lacks' name, her story and her inadvertent, yet powerful, contribution to medical science.

B0088P2A7A|5.0|This is a great app. I use it a lot on my nexus 7 and it works perfect. I def recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I read the first two books of this series and absolutely loved them, the characters and the story were so addicting. I was so psyched to read what I thought would be the final book. Well, the story seemed to drag along to the point where I kept checking how long I had left till the end, yet at the same time I kept having so many questions!! SPOILER ALERT:: like how the hell did anyone else know Gideon killed Nathan?! Who was that woman at the end with the red hair and green dress?! And how does someone's husband dissapear for days (while you think he got another woman pregnant) and then comes back like nothing happened!!<br />Idk, through it all I would definitely read a fourth book and hope it's longer and more to the point.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I just completed my first Kindle EBook.  I tried to upload it as a Word .docx document and the formatting was all wrong despite my best efforts.  I bought this book to get it done right.  I am not an html programmer but I know a little. This book requires you to do some HTML coding.  I was scared of the project at first, but decided to go through the book step by step biting off a little at a time.  The author gives you links to her own documents that make the process of formatting your Kindle Ebook right very easy.  So, I worked my way through the book, uploaded it and all the Kindle bells and whistles work.  So, I guess my major advice would be to not be scared of the html.  The author leads you by the hand through the formatting process step by step.  When you get done, you will have a professionally formatted ebook that you can be proud of.

B005LAII1C|5.0|I loved this movie, one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. My girlfriend and I watched it and we couldn't stop laughing through the entire film.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved the first 2 Books of this Series, i couldn't wait for the 3rd book. After finally getting it i was totally disappointed.In the first 2 books i couldn't stop reading, in this one, nothing, just boring, no real story line, nothing to look forward to. Any interesting event is done in a couple pages. If you take the sex scenes away you may have a quarter of the book left. Nothing against the sex part but even this gets old and predictable. The ending of the book is the same way. Nothing exciting, nothing to look forward to. The book just drags along. Very disappointed, i'm not sure i will get the next one.

B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I love Jane Austen, and tend to be a bit of a snob about it. This film is a good adaptation of Persuasion.  It is truer to the book than other versions I have seen.  The acting is good, and the characters feel real.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Beautifully written story. It is breathe taking. I couldn't seem to put it down. The story leaps off the pages with vivid detail.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|Excellent cast, excellent acting, and terrific story line.  A pleasure to watch if you enjoy Hepburn or Grant.  Jimmy Stewart is also excellent, but not one of his better roles (in my opinion).
B003FBMS4W|3.0|This was a great movie that I have been wanting to watch again for a long time. Just a last month this movie was free on Amazon so I was a little disappointed to find I now have to pay to see it, I also paid extra for the HD version, the video quality at the beginning of the movie was transitioning back and forth from really sharp to sort of fuzzy, this could be caused by my internet connection.

B007G51UV0|5.0|I bought three versions of this mobo at the old rotten-egg site, and they not only refused to replace them, they accused me of deliberately destroying the devices.  In fact, all three boards sold by the old rotten-egg site had obvious damage to the CPU socket pins.  But with this site, the first try was a keeper, so I will always buy mobos here for ever more -- or until I quit using PCs.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I enjoiyed it, it was a lesson in history for me.  Eventhough I knew Pres. Lincoln was a Republican, did not realize that it was the Republican party who fought hard for us and not the Democratic.  That was disappointing for me, since I am a Democratic.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|This was an exceptionally fun book to read as it brought my own memories of my ever-demanding mother whom I adore.  Those who protested this book misconstrued its purpose.  It was not a play book on better parenting or critique on Western values.  It was a personal memoir on a mother's unique methods to teach her children values to make them successful in their eventual chosen paths in life.  Even though I would not replicate the several deprecating tactics of Amy Chua, it does cause to wonder if I'm being too much of a Panda Dad.
B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|Child 44 is a gripping suspense thriller woven into the rich backdrop of Stalinist Russia. The story follows the journey of the protagonist Leo Demidov, an up-and-coming secret service operative and champion of the establishment who starts questioning the system more and more as he investigates a murder plot, till he finally sets himself on a collision course with the system in pursuit of what he feels is right.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book just for its portrayal of Stalinist Russia in all its gritty detail. Like a compelling historical period drama, the author invites the reader into the deprivations faced by the silent suffering majority and the constant fear of a paranoid all-controlling state. We observe this most keenly through the eyes of Leo himself when the state starts turning against him and his wife in its many and various monstrous ways.<br /><br />The storyline is also excellent. Most characters, including Leo himself, are multi-layered and develop as the story progresses. You are kept guessing whether many of the key characters are really for or against the system till the very end. Plot twists aside, the author is masterful in his development of Leo's relationship and romance with his wife, a central theme of the book.<br /><br />Altogether, this book is a page-turner for so many reasons and I cannot recommend it more. A most commendable first time effort from a new author!
B006T5C5PS|5.0|Lots of great information and it reminds us to take good care of our bodies, then they in return will take care of us.
0385349831|3.0|This book isn't your traditional novel. Except for the short opening and closing narratives, most of the book reads like wisdom literature from the Hebrew Bible, particularly Proverbs. The setting is the year 1099, when Jerusalem is on the brink of being conquered by the crusaders. Jews, Christians and Muslims gather in the town square to seek the wisdom of the Copt, an enigmatic sage who offers truth in times of trouble. His proverbial sayings are arranged around questions from his audience revolving around universal themes like love, work, war and anxiety.<br /><br />The book is very much in keeping with the ecumenical, inclusivist brand of spirituality that Coelho is known for. The Copt's sayings appear to have been drawn from a variety of religious traditions and are contradictory in places. Nonetheless, the overarching thrust of promoting religious tolerance in the face of the violent intolerance of the crusaders is commendable. Coelho's turn of phrase is also beautiful and compelling.<br /><br />However, I would have preferred a stronger narrative foundation on which to anchor the Copt's sayings. The book privileges aphorisms over storyline to the point that the crusader narrative is quite superfluous. The purposes of the author could have been served just as well with the book packaged as a compendium of timeless proverbs. Better narrative contextualisation might also have lent greater coherence to the sayings proferred. Perhaps this is a case of misplaced expectations. Maybe the book should have been marketed as a spiritual treatise rather than as a novel.<br /><br />A decent read but surely not one of Coelho's best.

B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|Hope Springs is, as you can probably guess given the actors and actresses starring in it, mostly suitable for the older (50 years or older, if not 60) marriage couples.  Of course this is entirely a comedy so you're supposed to be laughing... and the good news is that it *is* a funny movie overall.  Believe it or not however, several portions of the film actually provide useful information for any couple who's marriage no longer contains the spark that it once did.  I'm referring to the parts that focus on Steve Carell playing the part of the marriage counselor.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones of course play the wife and husband, and they are very good in their respective role.  Almost *too* good, haha.<br /><br />Meryl Streep wants to seek a 4,000-dollar counselor to help figure out her marriage, and with much reluctance, Tommy Lee Jones eventually decides to go along with it.  Now admittedly some portions of the discussion that takes place in the marriage counselor room are pretty graphic and personal, so please be prepared for these sexual-related discussions that focus on the act itself, the sexual position in which is most enjoyable for them, pleasuring ones self, etc.  It gets somewhat dirty (or honest, depending on your viewpoint) but this is really the *only* part of the movie that ever approaches this level of dirtiness.  The rest of the movie is remarkably clean and appropriate.<br /><br />Now, I've never been married so I've never been to a marriage counselor, but the way these meetings develop gradually seems incredibly realistic.  The comedy takes a much subtle approach than what I was expecting.  For example, the moment the personal subject of sex is brought up with graphic and specific questions, and Meryl buttons her shirt as a way to reveal she's uncomfortable going into detail, is an example of subtle comedy that's easy to miss if you're not 100% attentive.  The ending is perhaps one of the more unique endings I've seen.  While you can probably guess what happens at the *very* end, the stuff during the final 20 minutes is somewhat surprising to me.  Just goes to show how bumpy a marriage can be over the years when everything becomes static and nothing changes.  The VERY final line is incredibly funny though.  I won't spoil it, but something is said involving the neighbors during the marriage counselor meeting earlier on, and when it's finally brought up again near the end... NOW I get it. :)<br /><br />As a man, as weird as this may sound, this movie actually shows me how much women care about marriage.  It's important to a man too of course (because it involves two people making major permanent changes that the other has to adjust to) but Hope Springs further proves how important it is for a woman to connect with her spouse on a personal level and physically touch them in bed.  Good detail there.  The one thing that's hard to believe is that, this marriage got to the point that Meryl and Tommy Lee were no longer sleeping in the same room anymore.  Has anyone out there heard of a marriage getting to this point?  Even the people I know who have rocky relationships- they always end up sleeping in the same bed at least.  *Always*.  Seems somewhat far-fetched but I could be wrong.<br /><br />Overall, great movie.  Of course given the fact the cast is over the age of 60, you can probably guess that it's going to be a slow-moving down to earth type relationship storyline, and trust me, it is.  You have to really slow down your thinking process to appreciate the style that's taking place here.  You don't necessarily need experience in marriage troubles to grasp it, but it would probably make the movie even more rewarding if you did.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|As a huge Daria fan, I appreciate this complete series package and how reasonably priced it is. All of the episodes (plus the TV specials) are there. My only negative is that when the case arrived the cover was wrinkled and it falls apart easily if you're note careful, but in my opinion that's a relatively small negative compared to what you get for the price.
B007REV4YI|5.0|As with the previous Bond films, it lives up to it's legacy. It's pretty amazing that the Bond films keep rolling on with new stories & plots with nary a dull moment!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy looking for the items. The layout of the manor is fabulous, I wish I owned a home like this. Very fun game!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Wife wanted to watch this because of all the award hype. And, being a good little husband, i watched it with her. She was terminally bored, me less so. We both watch movies for entertainment. This one didn't provide much of that. I guess the &#34;Academy&#34; watches movies for reasons other than entertainment.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It opened my eyes to what our country's military & SEALS are willing to do in order to protect us. God bless them, & Chris Kyle!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved the effects!  The adventure was exciting and the movie as a whole was so intense that I was sitting on the edge of my seat!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is as it say simple easy and faster than go thru you menu to check the status of your bat.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Interesting structure but could get a little too unnecessary. Was a little predictable. Could do with a little more suspense. However a good read if you want something easy to follow
030759565X|5.0|I ordered this book for myself. After making several of the recipes I decided to buy it as a gift for my brother. He just graduated from college and is an avid cook. I'm sure he'll enjoy it as much as I am.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THE &#34;F&#34; WORD AND A  FEW MORE THINGS IN IT THAT I DIDN'T EXPECT. THE STORY WAS FINE, I'M JUST TIRED OF MOVIES THAT YOU CAN'T WATCH WITH ANYONE AND NOT BE EMBARRESSED . i JUST WON'T ORDER ANY UNLESS SOMEONE TELLS ME IT'S CLEAN.
1623420148|5.0|This book is easy to review.  I won't waste your time with a lengthy review when a few adjectives will work:  sexy, funny, well-edited.  Divine!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Really into this series! Can't wait to see the Movies! Exciting and thrill packed! like the twists and turns the storyline has!
193700788X|5.0|It is never easy to finish a series. Ms. Harris herself admitted that the Sookie series was getting stale. I have a deep respect for her writing, though, and Ms. Harris's stale beats out most other authors' best. There were numerous times that I thought to myself that I should stop reading and write down a phrase because there are always life lessons interwoven in Charlaine's books. For example,\\"I wasn't sure what grieved me the most: the fate of Arlene's kids or the fact that people could hand out hate like candy and find takers.\\" Awesome.
193700788X|5.0|I love this series and very sad that it is coming to an end.  I enjoyed this book and especially the ending....as in it was about time!
1594489505|5.0|This book was amazing! Khaled Hosseini, does a great job of painting the picture of Kabul....and the life those women lived .
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  It was just enough different to keep you interested through the entire show.  Good entertainment and since that is what we enjoy it doesn't have to be particularly deep for us to enjoy it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP ITS AWSOME WHRN I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT MATH THAT INVLOVELS COUCULATING I USE THIS :D
B000HZD168|5.0|Who doesn't love a Star Trek movie. Love amazon prime to see these old ones for free. Love it!  Thanks!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Watch the bonus segments on this one!<br /><br />Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence deserved the best actors award.  Being from Philly it was neat seeing many familiar sites.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This is a great app if you're not use to making art on anything other than paper or canvas. It's a challenge and a lot of fun to figure out how to layer things and make a great image. I love it!
1439153663|5.0|The book kept my interest the entire time, I felt like ! was there! The characters were so real and the story line was amazing.
B00B04NJLW|1.0|I consider myself a horror fan so I was excited when I heard about this film. I don't know what passes as a horror film these days but this one is like a 25 or so cases of wtf did I just see?<br /><br />I didn't even bother finish watching it because it was simply too much as in disgusting....groan and more WHAT is that about?<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl did an awesome job on this book. As a female executive and mother, I could realte to everything throughout the book.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|When you read a Nicholas Sparks book you know it's going to be a great heart wrenching, teary eyed wonderful romance story that just takes your breathe away. And that's what Dear John is. I love reading a book from a mans POV. It's just something about the way the a male perspective of falling in love and getting hurt just touches me a little bit more. Definitely a top fave of Sparks books for me!
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's exciting to playing play it almost every single day its fun to play all day my mom likes the game too
B00CW665VI|5.0|I LOVED this book!! I stayed up till 3am reading and i never do that! It was like a breathe of fresh air! I’ve never read a whole book in a mans POV so it was such a nice change! I laughed so so much and even got teary eyed a little bit but it was really fabulous! I read a lot of series and I wanted just to read a stand alone book that didn’t have a tortured past heroine and this was exactly that. I mean Drew was so funny and such a cocky SOB that you can’t help but love him. And Kate was so stand up /don’t take no crap kinda girl that you can see why he fell in love with her! This is one of my top fave books for sure! I liked that he talked to the reader like you we’re part of the story. Just Genius writing from Ms. Chase. Looking forward to her future releases. This is such a must read I can’t wait to tell my book buddies! :)
1455526959|5.0|This is an excellent novel, as good as anything he has written. It centres on the investigation of the murder of  Danish woman journalist,20years after the fact. The scene shifts between Los Angeles and adjacent counties and a British cruise ship hired as a place where soldiers could get some rest and relaxation during the first(or was it the second?) gulf war<br />The Journalist is gang raped on the ship,and she comes to Los Angeles in pursuit of the rapists. She is found murdered during the Los Angeles riots,and much of the investigation turns on the bullet used to kill her and the travels of the gun used. Bosch patiently follows the trail of the gun through various owners,and is alerted to complications by a phone call made to enquire about the investigation by a person using a false name. Anyway Harry finally sorts it out,the ending is particularly good,the chief villain escapes in a helicopter but the pilot forgets about  wind turbine behind the house and the copter crashes. Harry gets some unexpected help from a fellow officer who cannot believe that he has dropped the case and gone on vacation. The ending is particularly apt.<br />Peter Wigley
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series is just so outstanding I can't rave enough about it. Mr. Martin is a genius at writing with such description and character POVs that its like your transported to Westeros every time you open the book. The show on HBO does it very very well but to get the real feel of these characters and so much more story than they can fit in the tv show, I would highly recommend to read the books if your a fan of the show!
0061692034|5.0|I have always like Richard Ford's books,the ones located in and around Great Falls are of particular interest as I spent some time in the town and surrounding areas managing a project for Esso Chemical back in the late eighties. The actual location of the job was Collins,Montana,but when questioned by ERD as to why I did not live in Collins,I sent them a photo of the &#34;town&#34;,which consisted of a couple of ruined houses and a grain elevator and they asked no more questions!<br />This book starts off in Great Falls but soon moves over the border into Canada. The border in this area is particularly porous,I remember one crossing where there was a sign saying &#34;if there is nobody here please blow horn,because I am down at the house&#34; There are also some very sad remote graveyards in the area,as the land allotted to homesteaders by the railtroad company was not enough,barely enough to grow feed for the horses to say nothing of the people.<br />The nearest town on the Canadian side is Medicine Hat,known locally as &#34;The Hat&#34;<br />I particularly like the way the novel's anti hero disposes  the two investigators sent north to check on him,he just shoots them and buries their bodies. The book ends with signs of hope for the boy who accompanied the anti hero,it looks as though he will become a Canadian citizen and get an education after all,so the  ending is positive.There are many twists and turns in the plot but this si a sufficient ouline not to spoil it for future readers.<br />Peter Wigley
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you loved the first book in this series, well get ready because it gets taken up a notch! Really great action read with a slight blend of romance! Loved this series and the take charge Heroine Katniss!
B002LATN9G|5.0|cool real time street fighting movie that you can chill-out too . I have being looking for this movie about 3 years now. thank you gals and guys so much at amazon.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't say enough about this book! Genius writing and the change of POV with every chapter is just something that I've never read before! Just heart pounding amazing story and so well written. It is such a huge book and took so long to finish that I think my world stopped for about 2 weeks and I was transported to Westeros. A must read! Just Brilliant!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great game love it me n my husband can't stop playing it  everyone should buy this game dollar well spent
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is something different than I'm used to. But in a good way! The romance is background to the drama that unfolds but in a way that works! The heroine is very strong and self sufficient which is a big plus for me! Really good writing and action!
B008M721MS|5.0|When One of my best friends moved to Chicago I was super sad but when I got this kindle with Skype now we can talk and play anytime I love this app one problem though it needs plugins like voice master and fire arc arcade that would make it perfect
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just can't say enough about this book! It was Amazing and everything you'd want in a series book! Their story progressed nicely. The ending was just what you wanted with no cliffhanger. I am just in love with Ms. Day's writing and the way she captures your heart in the story. You just feel so much for the characters! And the love scenes were so Scorching Hot that I felt like I needed a cigarette after it was done! Can not wait for the next book! So in love with with Gideon's and Eva's story I can't express how amazingly touching, romantic, heart wrenching, and incredible this story is!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I Love it but update faster . My sister alredy has it :( 4 out of 5 because of that other than that MINECARFT
1935670913|1.0|It's a bizarre bit of self-congratulatory nonsense. I wish I knew that I could return it. At least it doesn't take long to read. A much better book, that is actually worth the money is David Gaughran's Let's Get Visible.
B001BR7CZW|1.0|I you love car chases, it is okay.  If you want an interesting story and well-developed plot, do not bother.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because this book captives u .because u been never would have expected what happened to happen .It was like it game u some details but not enough to wow u unroll u read it then it's like we'll I'm dumb because it was like the made it to were it doesn't sound good until u read it and it was freaking amazing. this is all in my opinion anyway lol:D
B000PC0S5K|4.0|Maybe a touch repetitive in its messages, but they are very useful insights and new ways of viewing the psyche.
B000FBFN1U|2.0|This feels like a repetition  of the previous 2 books. The female characters are mainly weak and only for raping or breeding, so the male characters become mainly rapists or breeders...boring!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like puzzles,then this game is for you. It is well worth the money.<br />I am glad that I bought this game.<br />Five stars
1449305172|5.0|It helps you connect the Lean theory with the practical reality.<br />I highly recommend this book for people that are at a very early stage at startups.

0345803493|5.0|My wife wanted the trilogy and of course, I bought them for her. They are all pretty trashy books. Definitely not for children. This is an adult read all of the way. Recommended for those who love indulging in smutty novels.
B000062TU1|5.0|Harry Potter is and will always be my number one movie series of all time.<br />That is why I was so happy that the DVDs that I had ordered were in perect condition. Not a scratch or a smudge on them.<br />Two thumbs up in my book!!!

B00CL50LEC|5.0|I love, love, love this movie!!  I haven't loved a movie so much in a long time.  It is the perfect love story.  I spin on Romeo and Julliett (his name is R but they never say what the name is)  Such wonderful moments. Loaded with laughs and memorable lines (don't be creepy, don't be creepy, don't be creepy)<br /><br />It is very, very low on the gore factor.  Really, the story is the important thing here.  Those of you who saw 28 days later will remember that rage caused the zombie epidemic,  SPOILER here love saves the damned.  Playful, not to be taken seriously by anyone.  It is a joyful little love story and will leave you cheering at the end.  I got the instant video but I am getting the DVD. This one is a must have.
1433531569|5.0|A great study bible that is compact yet has the all the features you would get in the larger size.  I love the color, as well.  My son has the same bible, with a different color; and he loves his too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun and entertaining for any age it has tons of games and the only down side is that the games have to use coins to unlock and to get coins Tokugawa have to pay or play a game over and over
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Story continues well, but a bit long winded. Otherwise nit bass and I will continue on to the next book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can't believe I have to wait for more..please hurry :) I need to know where this is all going..
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a very handy, useful app. Well worth the money I invested in it. Looks nice and I like having been given the choice to change the color to my liking...Thanks...
B00992CF6W|2.0|come on i love this games but the freaking updates come out 2 or 3 weeks after it comes out for apple. GO FASTER AMAZON!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the reviews about how upset that this was not the final book and was not going to read it because of the reviews but I am so glad I did. I like all 3 books and look forward to see where the rest of the books take us.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|I don't know how I am going to get 20-words about how stupid this movie was. I thought Borat was a near excellent comedy. This one doesn't even come close. If you want to waste your time you should watch this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|To drawn out. Mr. Grisham needs to stick to the lawyer stories,, & not try to make criminals look smart!
B00D41H2PS|1.0|I'm stuck on the ship; definitely closing the correct portholes (I even checked the walkthrough to make sure I was right about this) and the drawer simply won't open. I had my daughter try and she couldn't get it to work either. I'm playing on a Kindle Fire.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|I can't believe how old this movie is and I would still rather watch it than a new movie.  Love it... Watch the whole series in order!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game has me occupied day and night and it is worth more than $7.  The only problem is that the update comes out a little later than apple, so I have to wait for longer, but it's worth it.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The part of the series was okay to read, but almost seemed pointless. Nothing of any significance took place, nothing was accomplished. It almost seemed like a cheap novella that I paid too much money for.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|This is an older love story that never seems to loose its magic.  Bring a box of kleenex and go see it with a boyfriend, husband, or very close friend, so you can relate your feelings afterward.  Then go see a comedy.  Just kidding its one of my favorites or I wouldn't own it.  I recommend it!
B002ZG976U|5.0|A great getaway of girly fun!  I love Christina, so this is a fun movie to turn on for girls night.  Don't expect any amazing acting skills, and you won't be disappointed.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app so much and it works perfect and it also saves alot of battery for my kindle
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Well done in the attempt to tell the the story of how batman evolved from the dark knight to a resistance fighter.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|I thought the game was TERRIBLE!  All you do is try to figure out how to play, and you never make any  progress. I want to uninstall this game. I H8 this game. Don't get it!
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This is a game that I and my children enjoy.  It has enough upgrades and levels to unlock along with special missions and bonuses to keep the desire alive.  It is also simple to pick up and play and the early levels are easy enough for those who don't yet understand strategy.  I personally am a fan of tower defense and this is really a fun example with great cartoon animations.  The biggest draw back comes when you get to the higher rounds on any level.  The game states it will become laggy and it grinds to an agonizing crawl.  This happens after you have usually beat the challenge and are in free play mode, but is a downer.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|I've tried several weather apps before and this one is by far the worst. If your looking for a great way to keep up with the ever changing weather this is not it.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love the Piano Guys. They always have something new to surprise me with, and their music can be both entertaining as well as peaceful and relaxing. Would love to see them in concert.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always liked playing Solitaire with real cards.  This is the same game only electronically.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you don't.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm sure I have been more disappointed before but I can't remember when. I loved \\"Bared.\\" I was okay with \\"Reflected\\" but I am downright insulted with \\"Entwined.\\" This was the worst of the series and that's really saying something when you consider how mediocre \\"Reflected\\" was.<br /><br />This, I don't even want to call it a book; letters on paper lacked a plot, progression, romance, or even drama. It read like a porn script with little, meaningless, boring conversation thrown in the middle of who cares sex scenes. There wasn't anything romantic about Gideon and Eva's relationship in this book. Eva appears to have reverted back to a teenage nympho and Gideon has become nothing more than a spoiled little rich kid wanting what he wants when he wants it.<br /><br />Every character in this book lack communication skills and used raunchy, uninspired sex to compensate. By the 50% mark I couldn't have cared less if Eva and Gideon got together or not because I had grown to not like either of them. This was so much filler and trying to create problems for the series to continue and it all came off very contrived. Not to mention, this was supposed to be Gideon's story.. the man who has been having violent nightmares for the past two books and then the big reveal of the who and what happened is so meh inducing even the characters didn't spend more than a couple of sentences talking about it.<br /><br />Where was the drama, the excitement, the romance, the complexity that made these characters so great in \\"Bared?\\"  I can't believe a book that was delayed six months ended up reading so rushed and phoned in. I cannot in all honesty recommend this book and to be perfectly honest I also returned it like many other reviewers. There's no way I'm giving up my hard earned $10 bucks for a low budget porn script. I'm done with this series.
0393974650|5.0|I had to get this book for an English class. I did enjoy reading the book and discussing the metaphors and symbolism in the book.
007174889X|5.0|This is known as the Bible of Internal Medicine for good reason. Everything you need to know from medical school to life in practice is in these 2 volumes.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Easy to use but you need to know how to properly use it. Search the tutorial video on youtube for an easy way to use it without having to watch the ads.<br />Work great.
0394818237|5.0|My daughter looovvvees this book so much. She brings it everywhere. Great pictures and enough going on to entertain a preschooler for a long time.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Decent app. Does what it supposed to do. Would like more colors and maybe more f3atures to control battery life when low. Possible auto program shutoff when conservation of battery is needed.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It  is very strong. Has a place for everything you need. Many pockets, lots of cushions and dividers. Excellent item!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charger for Car (I also bought the wall charger for home) works flawlessly, charges both my Ipad and Galaxy Note 2 without any problems. Love that these chargers offer 2.1a and a 1.5a USB ports, definitely see the benefits when charging my devices!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  It ended far too quickly.  It was so thought provoking and intense.  It was quick moving and hard to put down.
0786962984|5.0|As a geek dad I have been scheming on how to get my 8-yr-old son interested in RPGs and wargames. We tried Wrath of Ashardalon and it was too fiddly.* Tried Pathfinder and it was still a bit...esoteric for him.* Then I saw Dungeon on the shelf and the price was right, so I gave it a shot. The short, short version is that it is right in the Goldilocks zone for RPGesque board games for us: straightforward and rewarding enough to keep both of us interested.<br /><br />* For us! I realize that loads of other people enjoy the heck out of these games. I like them myself. They just didn't hit the sweet spot for playing with my son at the age he is right now.<br /><br />The game pretty much delivers what it says on the tin. But we're enjoying it so much in part because it's a good platform for doing more. We started by making up our own dungeon maps--my son LOVES doing this. Then we added wandering monster tables, and some character advancement rules (now when one of us gets to our treasure target, we don't win the game, we just level up). I am toying with ways to include hit points and attributes. This game is not D&D, but it is possible to evolve it in the direction of D&D a step at a time. And we're both enjoying those steps a lot. Out of all the money I've dumped into games over the years, this one definitely wins in terms of enjoyment per dollar.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I bought this app for my daughter. We fight over who gets to complete the puzzle. I would definitely refer to friends.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Well I see some of our know-it-all reviewers have written novellas, so I will be brief as possible.<br /><br />I liked it.<br /><br />I will watch it again, not right away, but soon. Photography was beautiful, it is hard to follow in places, but that is the nature of the story. I found the make-up a little lacking in some places, very good in others.<br /><br />It depends on what you want, what you expect. Read some of those novellas, take the negative reviews with a grain of salt, and make up your own mind.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|kit's a good game. i have spent many hours playing it. the graphics are great. you may want to spend some money for upgrades though. this makes the objectives much easier.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Good movei love the special effects in it i will cherish it till the end of my life or longer !
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was so cool I didn't understand why Luke had to turn into Kronos I cant wait till the next book and how Percy will feat Kronos
B004TI5N38|4.0|THIS IS A FIRST IN A NEW SERIES BY D. BALDACCI.  NOT A BAD READ.  I ENJOYED THE CHARACTER AND JUST DOWLOADED THE SECOND BOOK IN THE SERIES, &#34;THE FORGOTTEN&#34;.  I WOULD RECOMMEND
B00992CF6W|3.0|Please update I'm dieing of sadness because it hasn't updated yet! I mean apple and the ppl who runs the Google play store has their update!! PLEASE UPDATE NOW!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so AWSOME just play it you'll love it your going to build some cool stuff. Just play it it's ok
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book I'm making my whole family read it. If you read 1 book in your life this should be it..
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The Room was a fantastic game that was fun fast and looked great, however I initially wanted to do the game with no hints but, as a anyone will find it is extremely challenging. Good thing the hints were there, albeit making the game less rewarding.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I don't like timed games. I like to just relax and take it leisurely. This game lets you do that and still move up in levels.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Very shortly after installing this app I find that I can no longer use my Kindle Fire HD.  :((  I wouldn't have thought it was a problem but my daughters Kindle is also not working right - same account.  Don't think it's coincidental.<br /><br />Battery Pro said my Kindle had about 53% at night, plugged it in to charge and when I woke up there wasn't enough power to turn it on.  Thought it was the charger, plugged it into another charger, for hours...wouldn't turn on.  Again the next night after not being able to use Kindle the entire day, it's plugged in charging.  Followed Amazon/Kindle instructions for restarting (hold power button, unplugged, for 20 seconds.  Then plug it in and push power button to turn on.) The screen says &#34;Kindle Fire&#34; as it has for the past 45 minutes.  I'm about to delete the app via my computer since I can access it from the Kindle.
B001FVV2X2|3.0|I gave it  episodes and ended up turning it off in the middle of the fifth.  The series has a decent story, but it just didn't hold my attention.  If all of the episodes were like the first, then it would have been better.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Good book, but not as good as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I like the multiple characters and their stories. it was hard to follow because the chapters have no title and you have to figure out who the person is in each chapter.  I also did not like how invested you become in Pari and Abdullah as siblings and then the story turns away from them until end.  It is worth reading, but don't expect it to be as good as the first two books.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Seriously. My boyfriend and I fight over the Kindle for this game. It's crazy fun and perfectly challenging. Great game!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game &amp; look forward to playing your other games. It was clearly one of my favorites so far.

B000B589JI|3.0|YES IT'S NICE AND PORTABLE FOR THE TAKE ALONG.....AND LIGHT. HOWEVER AS MENTIONED BEFORE IN ANOTHER REVIEW IT DOES LEAK. SCREWED EVERYTHING DOWN AS TIGHT AS COULD BE AND IT DID LEAK A BIT. MAYBE A PRODUCT RECALL. HOWEVER I WENT TO ACE HARDWARE AND FOUND A FAUCET WASHER O-RING TO FIT. INSERTED THE WASHER ON TOP OF THE ALREADY INSERTED FACTORY WASHER..RE-TIGHTED AND WELL-AH IT'S JUST DANDY NOW. HOPE YOU DO THE SAME IF IT LEAKS. HAVE FUN.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I had this app for a week just trying in vain to get it to open! It was frustrating me enough that I uninstalled it. I don't know if the app in itself is any good, but I have read a lot of negative reviews. Don't waste your time on this!!
B0026WNGBA|4.0|This running method has made me enjoy an exercise method I had always hated.  it is a good reference after taking a Chi Running of walking workshop.
B004I1AGTC|4.0|It has a good story line and really good fight scenes.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes martial arts movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm a seventh grader and I play this game all the time. fun for all ages. when I babysit I'll usually let her play this and it makes it really easy to keep her quiet since she is talkative
B007REV4YI|5.0|The acting and storyline were much better than the usual Bond movie and the theme song by Adele is just haunting.  It kept my attention and made us wish we had seen it at the theater too!
B00932A4XE|5.0|This is a great movie about what different women experience while they are awaiting the arrival of their children. It is a pretty accurate depiction of what really happens with good humor thrown in. The cast is great as well.
B001N3GUIE|4.0|Im a pretty big fan of sci-fi, so when a coworker recommened this to me I had to see it. Definitly different than today's movies,  forbidden planet stays relevant by addressing the problems of humanity as only sci-fi can. I found this to be quite a memorable film.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It's a realy fun game for all ages i guarantee you will love it i wish that they will lower the price but if they dont it's still worth every penny
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I've listened to the audio series and Cruise is a good character fit for Reacher. It kept my interest throughout!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I hope to purchase all the remaining series of TEEN WOLF.  Tyler Posey does a great job on the show.
B00992CF6W|2.0|the game has gotten very good, however i have no idea how to use eggs. i hope they start frequently updating!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|such a fun game for any age! only some aspects don't work on my kindle fire, but there is a place to find a way to fix it or complain about it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is very addicting game that I use to pass time and it is like a fun puzzle that u will definitely enjoy
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I got the free version for my 4 almost 5 year old daughter. She loves it! I went ahead and purchased the full version for $2.99 just to give her more options in make up and clothing and accessories. I've even played myself :)  I recommend it!
B001QB9ETK|5.0|One of my favorite films.  It has a great story of reduemption and justice.  It is a true story of how the Jesuit missions came into conflict with the slave traders and business people in the New World.  The music, cast, and story make this one of the all-time great films.
1250007305|3.0|If I'd not read The Innocent first, I probably would not continue and read that Puller story.  Going back to Zero Day, I found it like a slow walk around the park.  No wasn't anywhere near the suspense of the next book or the Will Robbie books.  The only really well written tension is toward the end, other than that it's plain old investigation and questioning.  When I finished, I was glad it was over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game features amazing possible creations and lets your mind run wild.<br />At first I didn't think I'd like the monsters, but you can turn it into peaceful mode and there's creative........ its amazing! so get it :)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love the the game so much. It has made my imagination. grow and I have it on the DS to!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Breaking Bad is a dark, suspenseful drama that sucks you in and won't let go.  Very well written and acted, it is a peek into a gritty underworld most of us never see.
B002BBJ52U|3.0|I am a rom-com fan...but this was no Love Actually...there were quite a few mediocre stories taking place - none of them were very interesting and the acting was mediocre as well. It's somewhat entertaining, but in a free sorta-way.
1847947115|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my brother. I was puzzling over why so many of my Jr. College students couldn't complete a semester when I knew they had the basic intelligence. I enjoyed it tremendously and it gave me much to think about. As a parent it has made me look at some of the choices I make for my children. I have passed it on to several colleages.
B003L77GH4|4.0|because I love the series if people want the series I suggest they get it its worth it thank you
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|I love the Die Hard movies except for Die Hard with a Vengeance. The action was pretty spectacular in this movie overall. BUT, the dialogue was freaking horrific. Skip Woods needs his arse kicked for writing such drivel. Granted, I don't expect Shakespeare but this was beyond the pale. I found myself cringing constantly. I love Bruce Willis and Jai Courtney. They made a great father/son team. I'm just sorry I bought this on blu-ray. Not worth it at all. Back to the drawing board, folks...
B00355L2TU|5.0|After the first 10 minutes I realized why contestants on the Biggest Loser were having meltdowns. If you stick with the workout and don't give up it is definitely tough. I can't wait to get the results from continued use!
B000LN7HUC|5.0|Just what I said I had been using a Stanley cookset but when I seen this one that will<br />All fit in one pot even the stove with fuel in it . Wow its so compact only thing missing is a carry sack to put it in . Hey this thing isn't just for looks the day I got it I cooked 2 scrambled eggs and  chopped ham with cheese in it and it came out awesome<br />And in the pot I made grits and they were great also . It is real easy to clean just wiped it right out . If you are looking for a cookset that won't over crowed your backpack I tell ya this one works for me
1885167776|5.0|How would your life change if you could improve your focus? In their new book, The One Thing, Gary and Jay help you stop lying to yourself about distractions, excuses and justifications that derail focus.  You'll also identify the Four Thieves that you may be robbing you of performance and, therefore, success.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love it.  You know quality will be good with the Amazon logo backing it up, and it is.  Light weight, and fits all my (3) lenses, etc.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had not seen the movie version of this book, nor did I have any ideas what it was about before downloading it to my Kindle.  With that being said, I was surprised to find out that this is a book about characters who suffer from mental breakdowns. Rarely do I want to watch a movie after I have read the book, but such is not the case with Silver Linings. I thought the novel was excellent, and I really had a difficult time putting it down; and, from what I've heard, the movie is just as good if not better.  If that is true then the  movie must capture  the wonderful characterization Matthew Quick developed in this simply written yet complex book focusing on mental illness and the role of loving family and friends. From the non-traditional, quirky therapist, to a father whose mood is determined by whether or not the Philadelphia Eagles win or lose a game, all the characters are developed in such a way that no one takes a back seat role in the importance of their relationship with Pat. This book \\"spoke to me\\" in so many ways...my love for running and dance, my need for routine and obsessive exercise, my role as a mother and wife, my husband's obsession with baseball (particularly the Cleveland Indians), and the fact that I, too, often don't want to face reality hanging onto the hope for a\\"silver lining,\\" are all the more reason why I thought this book was so great.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|If you are a history buff like I am you will enjoy this book. The characters are real as is the timeline and story. Ken Follett brings WWII to life in so many ways. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.
B00AK57N00|2.0|It was fun and interesting, for a couple minutes, and then is truly boring thereafter. The background is simple, the physics are great. The combination is soooooo boring.
0307476073|5.0|I like it because of her search for who she is and where she fits in - something I relate to.  I also like it for the setting.  I lived until age 14 in Oregon and loved hiking in the Cascades.  Her writing brought back many memories of hiking, camping, and mountain climbing.  Maybe the most endearing thing about the book is her raw honesty in looking at herself.
082221718X|2.0|I had a previous version of this play that was NOT newly adapted by Wendy Kasselman that I did use for middle school, but this edition uses intimate references to Anne's sexuality.  While students shouldn't be repressed from discussing their maturing bodies with their parents, it is not a subject that should be broached in a language arts class at school.  I will try to find the older version of this play that fits more with the 1957 black/white film.  I would not give this play to read to anyone under 17-18 years of age.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this is a very cute &amp; fun game. it has kingdom building &amp; fighting, so it has something for all to like.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game! You think it is easy but become very mind boggling the higher the levels. Very enjoyable for all age groups plus price is great........free!!
1475972350|4.0|TIME KILLER has a cast of well developed characters. However, Detective Max Larkin and his partner move casually throughout the novel as they track a bizarre, obsessive killer. Although the story was well written, nothing kept me on the edge of my seat. The story lacked any kind of suspense or excitement. The fact that the story was written in present tense was a bit awkward, too.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The last three or four books in the Sookie Stackhouse series have been pretty lame. I have been reading the books as soon as they have came out. I am such a Sookie fan. But I don't know if Charlane just got tired of the series or if the show Trueblood put too much pressure on her. But this last book was down right terrible. It was just so blah and had no real ending. What a dissapointment to a series that started out so amazing.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is a piece of crap product. These are knock offs not the real deal and if it was real then the product is sub standard compared to the original one I bought a year ago.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It is the first app I install every time I get a new phone. Just awesome they way it almost seems to read my mind.<br />Worth every penny.
B003SJ6W4I|3.0|If you're looking for a family movie that's safe for the 10 & younger crowd, this movie will fit right it.  It's silly, but a lot of fun.
1416583432|2.0|While I read the book easily, most of the information wasn't a great revelation unless you've never owned a dog before.<br /><br />What really made it hard to believe the other facts was not that the author quoted evolutionary theory w (not even correctly as it  violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics for scientific background), but it is revered as scientific evidence in this book.  That alone made me question the facts of the rest of the book.<br /><br />I fully understand both sides of the creation/evolution issue so that wasn't the problem.  The issue for me was that I bought it to read about dogs, not The Origin of the Species by darwin, I've already read that.<br /><br />I've read much better books about dogs.
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|1 hour 17 minutes into the show, image froze & pixilation in the black portion of the letter box.  No ending.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|The beginning of the book begins with the author wondering how to solve his foot problems but quickly expands into an entire community of ultra running , this book really impresses the idea that to run you don't need fancy shoes or to really try to beat anyone, rather it is to go back to the way nature made you and beat the course and yourself. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to run for any reason.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Ok, I struggle to write Lincoln correctly. However, despite that this is a good movie that seemed to drag a little at times to me.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is my 4th Nesbo mystery; although I finished reading it 2 weeks ago.  It has stayed with me. It was my favorite reading so far this year.  Don't start with this as your 1st Harry Hole read;  build up to it.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I guess there's no one in Hollywood powerful enough to tell Will Smith to leave his talentless son at home. The younger Smith is rigid, over-dramatic, and lacks charisma.  Add to that, a lame story line, bad narration, and crappy CGI...Not as bad as Battlefield Earth, but still one of the most mediocre sci-fi movies recently made.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Great series for the hunger games lovers as well as divergent series lovers. Trilogies are a wonderful way to tell a story.
032147404X|5.0|There are so many digital photography books on the market that are geared for beginners, that it was a little overwhelming to find the right book. After discussions with a few professional photographers, I learned about this author and was told that this book would be the best to start with. They were right. It's very easy to understand, has great illustrations, and allows you to get out there and start shooting immediately.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This series is wonderful! I am reading them aloud to my 9 and 11 year old sons and they beg for &#34;just one more&#34; chapter! We just finished book 2 (The Son of Neptune) and its surprising just how much they are learning (and remembering) about Greek and Roman myths in the process!
193700788X|3.0|I really enjoyed these books. With that said the last few didn't have the same spark as her previous titles, some have blamed that on the show being so completely different and affecting the overall \\"vibe\\". I have to admit, as a writer I would have signed a very different kind of contract with the creators of the show to protect my creativity a tad bit more--let's face it,it may be an entertaining show at times but they completely butchered the world that Harris has created. Much less whimsy by far and the books ended with that sense of whimsy in tact, for the most part. I don't know if it has the big red bow we all hoped it would and for many different readers that bow contains many different things. (SPOILER) I was not shocked that she ended up with Sam--although there was very little build up to it in this book (and there could have been a lot more than just the, \\"well--might as well!\\" approach for the idea of a happily ever after for me...but I digress)the idea was planted awhile ago and it really didn't surprise me. What did shock me was the complete lack of a send off for Eric's character in favor of a story line that, I get it--doesn't have much to do with him so at times it made sense to have him out of the picture, but why would you spend ten books building a character to cast him aside at the end?<br /><br />I also feel a little cheated knowing that there is now another companion book so that you can see what happened in the end to all of your favorite characters? Um, didn't I just spend $15 to find that out?
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I totally agree with so many of my fellow reviewers...This was marketed and sold as a TRILOGY.  I waited until June (when the last of the TRILOGY was sold) to read the entire series so I could get the whole effect of the story and so I wouldn't forget any important facts.  I was so disappointed in the ending!!!  This strategy of \\"it's not over in the 3rd book\\" of the TRILOGY reeks of the author/publisher milking the consumer for more money by adding more books to the series.  5???  And I was disappointed in the fact that these books were not able to be loaned to friends via Kindle.  More $$$  I LOVE the story of Gideon and Eva.  But enough already!  It is already so like E.L.James' original material in 50 Shades anyway....Their story should have been finished in the 3 books.  I feel so duped by the author/publisher that I followed the crowd...and returned the book for a refund.  Wow...
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash have a lot of features. I was thinking to buy the SB-910, but went for this instead due price and size. After reading the instructions and use it a couple of times indoors and outdoors, manual and TTL I have no regrets. This flash is great, and since my camera flash can be used as a commander flash it allows me to use it as a remote flash. If you asked me the SB-910 is an awesome flash, but the SB-710 is great if you are on a budget.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app!!! My sister and I both have it and can play together whenever we want. The only thing I dislike about it is how slow the 7.0 update is coming. We all just need to be patient!!!!!!!<br />~peace
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played and I was addicted to it,___ but I am still waiting for the 7th update for me but anyways u SHOULD get it. TRUST ME
B0041KKYEM|4.0|You don't really know what is happening at all times, merely because it is suppose to be a movie that works your mind.  Besides the masturbating and lesbian part, I liked the movie a lot.  It's about not only acting the part, but becoming the part.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|WORKS GREAT! Helps a lot to know what the battery is doing. Fire HD needed a quick way to check the battery.
B000V86OKG|5.0|In this season you see what would happen if the rest of the world knew what Dexter did. No, they don't know that it is Dexter but they are getting closer.  This season will keep you on your toes and you will learn more about Dexter's past.

B0050Q3UEM|5.0|This truly is a great app! I use it all the time and especially love the house and progressive channels. Great tunes to match any mood or situation. Give it a try, you wont regret it!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Haha! I love this movie, it's a classic. I decided I was a mermaid when I was little after watching it, so obviously I had to add it to my collection of films.  Ariel is one of my favorite princesses. Plus, I love this movie because the Prince isn't just a figure, he is actually a character in this one. This is a good, kid-friendly film and I say buy it! You won't regret it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great piece of the puzzle. The on going passion,dysfunction,love and action keeps you reading non-stop. I am loving it
B004EPZ07K|2.0|Seriously the storyline of this movie and everything is not okay.  Ryan can do better than this! It's so predictable, and it's not even good acting. Don't waste your money.
0544139453|5.0|[[ASIN:B008ON449S How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia: A Novel]], my first exposure to Moshin Hamid, turned me into a fan of the intellectual and gifted writer. Next came the movie version of \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist,\\" another winner. Then I read and enjoyed the novel even more. Heads up: the movie diverges significantly from the book. Hollywood routinely condenses and changes novels for cinematic purposes, but in this case, the plot and characters seem like cousins to those in the novel.<br /><br />With 297 Amazon reviews, the novel plot has been amply summarized, so I won't do it again. Hamid has a rare ability to create characters who are both unique and universal. Every person is molded by the time and place in which he/she lives. What makes Hamid a powerful storyteller is how he goes about developing a character's story into part of something much larger.<br /><br />For anyone who has ever immigrated to another country and dealt with learning the language, culture and mindset, Changez's story is very believable. His critical moment comes on 9/11 watching TV coverage of the burning Twin Towers from a hotel room in Manila. Mine came packed in a giant plaza and holding my pre-schooler's hand as the crowds massed around us singing their national anthem during their Independence celebrations. My daughter would never say the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag with the same conviction with which I recited it.<br /><br />At the prestigious Manhattan valuation firm where Changez is hired fresh from Princeton, the mantra is, \\"Focus on the fundamentals.\\" Changez, whose name is spelled almost the same as \\"changes,\\" applies that advice to his life on various levels. Near the end of the novel, he sums up his dramatic conversion saying, \\"...try as we might, we cannot reconstitute ourselves as the autonomous beings we previously imagined ourselves to be. Something of us is now outside, and something of the outside is now within us.\\"<br /><br />In my book, Hamid is one of the most insightful and thoughtful novelists writing today.s one of the most insightful and thoughtful novelists writing today.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|First off, this movie is the cutest movie ever. My mother does not like animated movies at all, but she thought this one was really cute.  We both laughed the whole time through, and cried when the times were right.  The DVD was also in good shape.  I recommend this to everyone of all ages.  Seriously, you won't be disappointed!!!
B009ERK1T0|3.0|I have loved every Deftones album I have (all of them) up to this point, but this one falls a little flat in my opinion.  I never thought I would say it!  I don't find myself listening to this one very often at all.

B000NIVJGI|5.0|Really good rework to get it to go to Blu-Ray.  This version really POP's when coming from a Blu-Ray player
B0066W1AZK|4.0|good play and love the adjustable Ai gives a real challenge and still playable by novices<br />I do wish they would add more color choices for the pieces and board
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Very exciting and humorous.  Some seriously strong bad language, not suitable for the younger set.  Blu-Ray version really shows it well.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great Game...only one minor thing, sometimes one enemy is invisible and can't attack it...it also gets stuck, so the game has to be reset
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Eben Alexander is not a writer, but he has some pretty important things to say in this book. I think the most important concept that EVERYONE needs to embrace these days is that you are ill-served by your dogmas. Not an especially riveting book, but I'm glad he wrote it and glad that I read it. This isn't a literary piece of art so much as it is an opportunity to re-examine everything you know, think you know, believe, and don't believe.

B0047SIXGE|4.0|Apocalypse Now is one of my favorite movies.  It took me three tries to make it through Redux without disgust.  There were holes in the original, little incongruities, clearly a result of editing away what was replaced in Redux. That having been said, not all of it was good.  Perhaps the original editing preserved us from the turn Robert Duvall took.  LTC Kilgore, at the end of his scene, transformed into a mockery of himself, which the original cutting spared us.  In the original, we saw enough of the bunnies.  Is it fair, reasonable, or even really consistent with  CPT Willard's character to assume he would have exchanged oil for what he did?  The oil was part of the mission, and all he really wanted was a mission, and as he said, &quot;for my sins, they brought me one.&quot;  The French Plantation owners were perhaps the single additional scene worth consideration.  It opened up a possibility for Willard, an opportunity for redemption, perhaps peace, after his mission or even better as an alternative to his mission.  Could he have gotten off the boat?  Should he have?<br /><br />The point is, the original was near perfect, every moment driving us up the river.  Redux, is important for aficionados, only to complete their understanding of Copolla's masterpiece, but in this particular case, I think he got the editing right the first time.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|What we have here is really a general purpose disaster preparedness guide disguised as entertainment.<br /><br />Admit it: those official government guides are duller than dishwater. Remember those old Civil Defense booklets about how to survive a nuclear war? How about the Y2K disaster-that-didn't-happen? Or the current crop of Homeland Security sites about what to do if al-Qaeda shows up in your hometown and starts blowing things up? The threat may change, but the advice is the same. And so is the tone. Unfortunately.<br /><br />What Max Brooks has cleverly done is to leverage a fanciful scenario (a mass attack of the undead) to get the reader to think about real disasters (e.g., storms, earthquakes, etc.) and how to prepare for them. Granted, it's unlikely you'll stop a hurricane with a machete, but--as recent events have shown--you're much more likely to survive the aftermath, when emergency services may be hard to come by for several days or even weeks, if you're prepared.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|great movie! the digital copy is cool to give to someone who hasn't seen it yet. now i need to read the book. a lot of synchronicity in this film. i recommend it to any open mind
B005Q1W10A|5.0|There has been enough said about the series itself so I will review only the DVD set. This entire box set played well without any issues. It has some special features which I recommend watching because they are additional story lines. I believe this version is the full UK version and more than what was featured on PBS in America. I played these discs in my DVD player and my Blu-ray player without issue.

193700788X|1.0|I had book 10 Dead in the Family for 3 years and have yet to finish it. Every other book I have, I read in a matter of days after receiving. I dont think I will continue on, because I want to remember the characters I fell in love with as they \\"were\\". I dont want to read on be dissapointed as I so many others are.
B0091X4EYK|5.0|I had already seen this movie prior to buying it on amazon but I have no complaints on the digital copy I bought from Amazon. The picture and sound quality was excellent and the price was comparible to the convenience of the versatility of owning this movie in it's digital format

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|*Mild Spoiler Alert!*<br />I am so disappointed in this book.  I love Sylvia Day's writing style and usually her stories take off for me. She usually has just the right mix of erotica and story beyond the sex.  When I read \\"Bared to You\\" and \\"Reflected\\", I shouted, screamed, laughed, etc.  They were good and I reread each in anticipation of the next.  Mind you I got into the series late.  I was so excited to hear a 3rd book was coming out I couldn't wait.  What I got in the third of the series was lots of sex and teeny bits of story.  Don't get me wrong.  The sex was well written and hot but way too much, almost just mindless porn, which is not quite what Entwined was but it was awfully close.  Good lord!  It got boring after a while.  I wanted to know about Gideon and Eva's lives.  We knew the sex was hot and didn't need THAT much of it in the third book.  Every chapter had multiple sex scenes! I found myself saying Not again! out loud and flipping to get to actual story instead of just the sex scenes.  By the end I couldn't wait for the story, as much of it as there was, to just be over.  I think the third book was stretched with fluff and gratuitous sex.<br /><br />I know the book is erotica and by definition sex is a major part of the story.  However, the reason I have liked Ms Day's books in the past and liked the first two in this series is because sex was not just thrown in because there had to be sex.  The sex was an integral part of the story. In books one and two of the Crossfire series, the sex helped explain the two characters' attraction to each other, their dysfunction and how they coped with their pasts and made a relationship work despite their pasts and issues.  Sexual attraction initiated the story but there was character development that followed and a plot.  The stories progressed.  You learned that Eva had a past that involved sex from her being molested to have a series of destructive relationships as a result.  The first book hinted at Gideon's issues but book two detailed why he was so controlling.  He was also abused, as well as having a plethora of other problems.  In book 3, I am sorry to say, it was substance light.  I can't even convey how the story line progressed because for all intents and purposes it didn't.  It was just sex and oh, Gideon has moved next door secretly. What! The umph that I have grown accustomed too regarding Ms Days books was missing.<br /><br />I guess you can see that I was sorely disappointed so I will end the review here.  Just beware. To me, it was NOT worth the wait and I really hate having to say that.<br /><br />peace.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Engaging, addictive and fun started playing on my granddaughter's kindle and got hooked. Now I have already killed my battery twice in the<br />Last 4 hours.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The characters are developed much better in this second book of the trilogy.  We get a deeper look at both characters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it so much that I purchased the rest of the series.  I think I have read<br />them all at least 4 times.  See something I missed each time.
1451668945|5.0|My wife really liked this book. Even suggested that I read it. So it must be good. So far she has read almost all of Mary Higgins Clark's books.
B0012CH350|5.0|Good product.  Nice fit on grill.  Material appears to be strong and should hold up well to the weather conditions in Michigan.
B001TH16DI|5.0|After going through VHS, then DVD, these are the best copies so far. They went back cleaned them and they picture and the sound are excellent.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I remember the movie,  It is great can' t wait for kids to read it, movies today even cartoons for to much.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Unlike most of the reviews I read I loved the book!<br />I love the story between Gideon & Eva and I'm glad the story doesn't end here. She did leave us with a lot of questions but I liked that! I liked that we are getting more. No telling where this story goes. I can understand that people are upset at how it ended but it left you wanting more..... more answers to the stories left up in the air. I just hope the next book doesn't take as long to come out!!<br />I don't want to give away too much of the book but I liked how she added more people into  their lives like Wil and Megumi. I want to know more about all these secrets with Gideon as well.....so many questions. It was well worth the money for me and I cant wait to see where the story goes next.......
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My grandson loved it, for me 50.00 was alot.  But his smile was great. It was so little old people what can you do.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Anything Kathy Reichs writes is great and she doesn't disappoint with this book!  Great ending. She's a great story teller.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Have not really had a good change to play but I think I will enjoy it and I sure my grandkids will
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The plot goes nowhere - slowly. Eva & Gideon reassuring each other of their love is done over and over.... Even the sex scenes are boring.<br />Ms. Day is milking this series for every buck she can make which is why it is no longer the promised trilogy.  To the readers who are &#34;excited&#34; about book four I send my condolences. To the reviewer who sent instructions on how to get a refund for a Kindle ebook purchase I owe my gratitude.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|though it was free but you need more money to play - need to find out how it get it off before kids spend more money
0375869026|5.0|What a find! For all ages and one that you will remember for a life time!!!! Happy reading and one to keep on your shelf.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I like it I think but the extra money thing  gets me.  I have not let kids play, I am afraid they will hit one time pay click
B002QNBRXS|5.0|This season was unfortunately a bit spoiled for me by the description on season 5. DON'T READ IT. However, it was impossible to spoil the whole season. It was a great season that I marathoned because I couldn't keep myself from clicking on each new episode. Amazing. The trinity killer is enthralling.
1616550414|5.0|A must have for all Zelda fans. Great art and text, plus it helps you understand the plot that connects all games.
193700788X|1.0|After reading through the whole series, this final book destroyed the whole story. I will no longer suggest people to read the series. I feel like I wasted my time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SUBWAY SURFER IS A LIFE TIME GAME THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND HAVE WITH.
B008L1F91A|3.0|With the exception of the face, the overall sculpt and look of the figure was excellent. The face was just too Anime looking which is a shame because if it looked anything like the superman face on the packaging it would have been amazing. Additionally, the eyebrows were too furrowed and made him look angry. The whole head/face needs re-sculpted.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is fun and easy to use! This is better than a normal village game because there is more to do like when you battle! I would refer this app to anybody who loves to build or loves the movie epic!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|A great album, good flow, interesting variety and selections.  I didn't know much about classical Hawaiian artists till I heard a show on NPR about them, and this album was mentioned as a good starting point.<br />Put it on, and take a little vacation.<br />Also, makes a really great gift for any family members who have been to Hawaii.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is a really cool game i like it a lot it is very fun i can play this all day
1426209584|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic!!  Most amazing photographs that make you want to jump on a plane and go spend 2 years in the jungles of Papua New Guinea to find all these birds!!  Highly recommend this book.  You will not be disappointed!!!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Awesome and cute for little angles my sister loves this game and bugs me to get my kindle out so she can play this game a must get game you should get this game for your little sisters if you have one or two
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I haven't examined the back story of this album nor read all the lyrics--did one of them have a partner die? The mood of this is almost relentlessly somber, or at least calm--you'll wait in vain for much of anything catchy like \\"The Blood Is Love\\"--but it's so incredibly lovely. I liked every song on first hearing and a couple of these songs pierced me to the marrow--such gorgeous chord progressions. Looking forward to hearing this many more times.
0143120530|4.0|An interesting read. I particularly liked it when he beefed up some of the methodology by showing the reader what was going through his mind. Clever how the problem for accounting for conjunctions and abstract words could be conveyed to the memory. Lots of good history about mnemonics.Lots of good insights and introspectioninto what having a good memory means.<br /><br />I had followed the Daniel Tammet,Brainman, story years ago when it appeared on the Discovery Channel. Foer did some clever investigating to reveal some suspicious details of Tammet's abilities.<br /><br />Two good reads on the mind that deal with mnemonics and improving one's mind are Mind Hacks by Tom Stafford and Matt Webb, and Mind Performance Hacks by Ron Hale-Evans. Both written around 2006.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Definitely this is not going to be my favorite Megadeth album, but nor my least favorite. Agree the lyrics are half-baked and, yep, as someone else said, it does kind of sound like Dave was phoning this one in. And it's short--45 minutes. Nonetheless, I found nothing genuinely objectionable on first listening, and found I immediately wanted to and did listen to the whole thing again, so I can see coming back to this reasonably regularly. Biggest gripe: at the end of \\"Don't Turn Your Back ...\\" is something that is splendidly beautiful--parts of this song put me in mind of Hendrix and \\"Little Wing\\"--but it happens only once and then the song ends rather abruptly. Aargh!
B000SX89ZM|5.0|This album marks their status in the pop industry and how they have grown as a band, great album must have!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So worth the wait! Don't know how I'll wait for the next one. Couldn't put it down for a second.
B001OR0AEY|5.0|The music is traditional cuban which makes me want to dance. The musicians were rediscovered by an american which is a touching story. I don't watch  documentaries very often but I loved this one.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show is incredibly entertaining, and the plot and story lines are intriguing while also remaining largely realistic and feasible.
B00002SWEM|5.0|What a great documentary to remember the great Cuban music and musicians that helped keep the golden times of Cuban music alive.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Stephen King is an excellent writer and I enjoy his books as much for his prose as for his plots; they make reading enjoyable.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Just love this album.. these guys had a genius sound.. It's my go-to record in my car when the radio has nothing good on.  Literally every song on it is good!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|To try and get back into the mindset of this third book, I went back and read the previous two first.  It was almost an abrupt change I the writing style and almost monotonous in the sex scenes.  I hope Sylvia Day gets her mojo back if she writes another sequel as the ending of this book drops you off mid air.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|It only took about one year and one month for my wireless Logitech MX Revolution scroll wheel to randomly start scrolling by itself. As you probably know, after you're out of warranty, Logitech no longer wants to talk to you, and to the trash it went. Anker, on the other hand, REALLY wants your business. Allow me to address another reviewer's concerns. Re: &#34;TOO LIGHT/quality of materials&#34; - It's true, the plastic on this mouse does feel a little insubstantial. I believe this is on purpose, as it is intended for the rapid movements associated with gaming, and is more of a lightweight running shoe than a work boot. But it's not like it's going to break, it's a well-engineered piece of machinery. My only suggestion to Anker, therefore, is to consider making a second, more substantial version in the future for desktop non-gamers, made with thick, heavy plastic, but with all of the wonderful bells and whistles this version includes.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A well written, quirky tale. Endearing characters, who you can relate to. Not lightweight, but not too complex. Worth a read.
0449808696|5.0|This book is exceptional and you will do yourself and your family a disservice if you don't read it. It is actual very scarey and shows how we have been mislead for year. May read it and learn
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat all the way to the end of the book. Awesome story can't wait to read the next book.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Surprisingly engaging action movie. Tom Cruise plays a similar sort of character to the one he played in &#34;Knight and Day,&#34; though darker and with less humor. This is a more serious movie about a horrendous multiple murder which Jack (Tom) is called upon to solve by an old enemy. Not for kids (violence), but I let my older teens watch it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|As with the other books in this series, I really enjoyed reading it.  I love these characters, and seeing how they grow.  Eva and Gideon are both different in this book; much more confident than they were.  I was hoping for an ending, but with the things that happen in this book, I can absolutely see how it could not be wrapped up just yet.<br /><br />I know some other reviewers feel like things were being dragged out, however I felt like the book had a great pace and feel like if it had just wrapped up it may not have really felt like a conclusion.  We all want them to have their \\"Happily Ever After\\" but nothing is easy with these characters and wouldn't a simple wrapping of this story be a little disappointing?
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Updated Review: August 2013 -- While I still stand by my original review about the game being educational, fun, etc., it is with sadness that I have to say, I had to delete it it about month ago from my Kindle Fire HD. With the forced game software update it kept freezing and then it gave me new profile. I wrote to Disney Interactive, they reset it to my original profile (I kept log of my stuff). Unfortunately, I couldn't get came to load anymore. It would just stop. I was on level 35 or 36. I've thrown all my logs out so can't remember.<br /><br />If you can get it to continue to work, kudos! I loved this game. I still say it's a great learning game. When it works.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />If you just delve deeper into this game you might be surprised at what a wonderful small world opens up. Zoom in close after placing certain plants, coral and specials to see what I call my bonus babies.<br /><br />I see a lot of reviews stating that you have to purchase things. No, you don't. What you do have to have is patience. Patience to wait to earn sand dollars, algae and yes, even pearls. It will take a while, but you can learn so much.<br /><br />It is also a game of strategy, learning which combination of living plants and algae give you most bang for your time. The higher the level you are on, you may want to reevaluate what you have. Just remember to write down helpful tips and hints when you receive them.<br /><br />Yes you need Wi-Fi, but since I play at Home it's not a problem.<br /><br />My only complaint... developers didn't allow for auto orientation of the game. So on my Kindle Fire HD, I can't be plugged into the charger while playing. Boo.<br /><br />Otherwise, awesome game, stress buster and learning tool!
B000TEVJYS|5.0|What can I say? The best album of the mid-90s. Great chilling music. Incredible quality. A little on the dark side.
B0006OBPTA|3.0|This is a 3 disk set that contains the first 4 Karate Kid movies. The first 2 disks have a single movie on them. They viewed great, The Third disk contains 2 movies. We did not make it through either movie before the picture froze abd wouldn't continue to play. Very disappointing. My son is into Karate and he was bummed that he couldn't see either entire move. I get what I pay for even though the seller said they were new. I think they just had new shrink wrap on them. :(
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a very fun app.  I don't get why people contuinuously complain about the updates though.  The reason. we get the updates.later is because more people use apple than kindle so they work on the apple first.  The reason I rated 4 stars is because after a while it can get a little boring
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait till the next book! I don't want to rush it but at the same time I can't wait to see where this story goes. As always well written and left me wanting more Gideon and Eva!!!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Romantic fellows. I had forgotten how the movie went. I hope my friend's kids will watch it.<br />And lastly, David watched it in the movie; Prometheus.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Honestly I only got this one cause my Mom wanted me too but I am so glad I did.It had a really good story and the visual effects were stunning, and unlike most 3D productions I have seen, this one actually surprised me with how well the 3D brought it to life!
B00B4804KS|4.0|3D fuzzy in foreground.. maybe it worked better in theaters.<br />I think I am wearing the glasses correctly. Just a joke.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This film was heavily hyped, but it lived up to expectations.  Did a really nice job portraying issues surrounding mental illness without getting sappy or finding an unrealistic Hollywood ending.  A very well told story.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I'm surprised at Barbara for doing such a stupid movie.  This was a complete waist of time and money!! Kill me already...
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This was a beautifully told story, showing the background of Jiro, and how he ended up being the great sushi master.  You really felt like you knew him.  Told with artistry.  It is what a food documentary should be, which too often isn't the case.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|Ghostbuster is a fun movie, but the 4K didn't look any better than a regular blu ray. A regular DVD would be fine.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing and the CG is so lifelike that you believe the tiger is real.  The acting is fantastic.
B00BPA2PGG|4.0|4K mastered is an improvement over the regular blu ray. The amount of improvement is slight with better color.  Is this better than the regular blu ray, yes.  I own both.
0756405890|5.0|I'm not a book critic. I am a lover of books. Especially, fantasy. I have probably read thousands. I can't get through a day without at least one good book. Thank you,Patrick Rothfuss, for helping feed my addiction. This immediately made my top ten list upon completion.<br />Much Love,<br />A Bibliophile
B000YMFCS4|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an all around good movie, but there was a little slow at times. I would recommend this movie to my friends and relatives.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great app Bering some feturs in Pc and xbox it just needs to update faster.  on opossum it updated a wile ago so why isn't it updating for the kindles.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|The two leads, though lesser-knowns, are just terrific in this film.  Although clearly written for a teen audience, adults will enjoy the clever screenplay, Charlie Bukowski's poetry, Jeremy Irons (the thinking woman's man), and the ever-talented Emma Thompson.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|it is OK if you go for the kind of pop music they mash up. I prefer jazz inflections, or the original. But good for them in pushing the envelop.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|First I thought the price was way too expensive but bought it anyway because I read the first two and wanted to finish the series. I couldn't believe the ending and now I understand there are two more books? I think this could and should have been the last one. I don't know that I even care what happens next especially at the price she charges. I loved the characters in the first two books but I am kind of done with them by the end of this one.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Ever since SwiftKey swiped (no pun intended) Swype's signature feature, it's been king of the heap. This is clearly the text entry app to beat, now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely a page turner . . .but if you're in the market for more than that, I'd suggest shopping elsewhere.
B005USZML4|5.0|Very good addition to the Theo Boone series .  Gripping story line keeps your interest.  Can't wait for the next one.
0425220931|5.0|WE in our families and friends are very musically and spiritually inclined, so this book seemed like a perfect publication to add to our vast family libraries and WE are ALL pleased to read it and share with others who also have found it to be a worthwhile reading experience.<br />Blessings.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book did an excellent job at keeping you guessing.  Sad it's over but worth the ride.  The end.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|So, have you seen this movie already in years past or recently ??? It is an interesting and fun TALE and TAIL which not only brought smiles and wows into our lives, but also new perspectives about the categories of lives presented in this fun tale, and not only that, but we really feel that many of the pictorial and storyline experiences presented in this movie, are, in fact, real experiences of their here and now counterparts in our natural world. So, yes, this tale has become one of our most enjoyable and welcome items into our vast family libraries for now and years to come, and our friends also only had positive experiences with this film. Thank you to our favorite Amazon again for making this item available through you with excellent pricing, shipping, and customer support. Blessings and fun days to all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Thank you for a fantastic book. The twists and turns are great. But the love Eva and  Gideon share is most spectacular. Hope the next book comes out soon.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I'm still reading, but enjoying a lot.<br />A lot of new information.<br />Michael has a very interesting point of view about food.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Totally recommend this to all of those who enjoy the circus. 3D is very well done and sound immerse you like you are there.
0618680004|5.0|This book speaks of many of the harsh truths about religion. For someone on the fence between belief/non-belief, this book is an effective tool in persuading you to use your logic and reason to determine whether or not the idea of a god, especially a Christian god, is in any way, shape or form, reasonable. However, I think that most Christian's will be appalled at the directness of Richard Dawkin's views on religion and specifically Christianity. However, one of his main points is that religion should be analyzed at the same level that we analyze anything else, so taking offense to this only proves his points even more. It is a good book and I encourage you to read it.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I am really enjoying watching these again.  This show would not last 5 minutes by todays standards but I am enjoying the nestalgia of the times.  No cell phones, rotary dials, Brick phones in the fanciest cars.  the formula of seeing who the killer is first, is probably not going to do well with todays generation but they may enjoy the bizzarre lack of technology when computers were room filling, and you had to find a pay phone to call people, and everyone smoked and drank at work.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I ordered this book when it was offered as a Prime free lender. I enjoyed reading it and it was nice to just get involved in someone else's life even if it was a work of fiction. It was easy to picture many of the places she subscribe. Not disappointed.
B006ISJQ1W|2.0|I do not know how you go wrong with ingrediants like Hunter S. and Johnny Depp.  This film did not shock imspire or empassion me at all.  It was dull and flat and I left it running when I left to make a sandwich.  Maybe it was money, or rules, or too much rum.  The extras on this are however amazing.  If you buy it to admire johnny Depp, a favorite reason of mine, not his best look.  Not his best acting.  Buy it for the extras, a peek into Hunter's life and relationship with hsi writing and his people, incuding Mr. Depp.
B005N09L5C|2.0|I read the book and still thought it was hard to follow. My husband didn't read the book ahead of time and I had to explain what was going on. I think movies should be able to stand on their own and you shouldn't have to read the book ahead of time.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Great little app lots of options. Also includes a sleep timer that closes the app. Only issue is some of the loops are really short
B002VPE1WK|5.0|very nice camera backpack for the price. I like that all the compartments are adjustable. Lots of little areas to put things. Straps are very comfortable. It was shipped very quickly as well. very happy with this purchase!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good game but way too short for the price. Would like to see it keep going in more levels and more of a story plot.
B004XIZLAY|5.0|This book is beautifully written. Starting with a short history of the Middle Kingdom, it provides the reader with insights into some of the most important events in recent history.<br /><br />Chapters are commenced with a clear statement of the issues addressed within it and of the principles that are informing the discussions being held between Chinese and other world leaders, principally American. Actual quotes are abundantly provided.<br /><br />It should be read by everyone who has an interest in China and in global politics generally.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Great way to track you battery. It is easy, straight to the point. Anyone can figure it out quickly and the  notifications are great.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Original as expected on all forms! I was happy to receive my cd with no scratches, no breaks and clean.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This is one of the best movies that came out last year. Highly recommend to big comic book fans and people who like a lot of action in their movies.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Twilight series. Especially after reading the books. This movie, however, was a big disappointment. There were sooo many nuances in the book that were very important that were left out of the movie. Watch for yourself, but be forwarned...
B001GMQALY|1.0|This was highly shortened and edited (the good parts missing) version of the movie. Theater version was good/decent. This version of the movie had dull content.<br /><br />I will read future DVD descriptions better, and hope to make sure to get closer to theatrical versions if possible.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|i.believe that not only dads should see this movie but men who want child , even boys should this movie.. it puts the real meaning of being the man of the house n what a dad should be. any man can be a father but takes a Courageous man to be a dad..
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|What a great book series!!!! ONE after another I couldn't put them down. Looking forward to reading something else of hers.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm dying for more! I can't believe how fast this book went! Seriously can't wait for the next one! (:
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I started with free game and got so hooked forked over the five bucks and played the game until it was done.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works great. Now I don't over charge my device.no problems with this app. Check it out. I think you will be surprised on well it works.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Ok there are three words that if you took them out of this movie it would have been silent. Could have been a very entertaining movie but it got to be too much. Didn't finish watching.
B00005NWM3|3.0|number 6 on the cd skips like crazy but that was the only song i like but i cant even listen to the way i said it was okay
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Don't waste your money on this movie...Poor acting, weak plot, and the video was more of a \\"C\\" class movie copy...What can I say other than it sucks...
B005LAII4E|3.0|If you remember what happened to the US president played by Jonathan Pryce in \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" (2009), you know the sequel is inevitable. Despite its disappointingly low \\"positive\\" score on Rotten Tomatoes (28 percent), I didn't find \\"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\\" to be as horrible as professional critics would lead you to believe. At least, I was not bored.<br /><br />That is not to say that \\"Retaliation\\" is an action movie masterpiece. The story unfolds in a not very compelling way. Cobra strikes back, framing the G.I. Joe team for assassinating the Pakistani president. Then the surviving warriors - Flint (D.J. Cotrona), Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Duke (Channing Tatum) - fight back, with a help from General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis). Interestingly, the film's rather formulaic script is penned by the team Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of \\"Zombieland.\\"<br /><br />So where are Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee)? They appear but perhaps not in the way you expect. Martial art action scenes are at best average, though the cliff-hanging ninja sword fight sequences in the Himalayas are impressive.<br /><br />In short \\"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\\" is mindless fun, with several nice action scenes.
1881273377|5.0|Truly life changing content, I feel very fortunate to have been introduced to this book.  I will always look deeper when relating to people I care about.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I had to get this movie on Blu-ray as Soon as i could, It is a short film, but has plenty of reasons to watch multiple times. I personally like the Good VS. Evil plot, I already saw this back in the 80's on VHS, but I decided to get the Blu-ray in hopes of renewing my interest in the movie, it also has some Extras I've not watched before.  I don't want to reveal too much, so Buy the Movie, I've already watched it, I enjoyed it. I was so absorbed by this movie, I hardly knew there was a Severe Thunderstorm right outside my apartment. Well I do have a nice 5.1 Surround Sound System in my bedroom :D
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I felt no connection to the story, and I had no sense that the author did either.  I would rather wait longer for a better story.  I like the characters and I felt like there were such great ways to move thrm forward, they don't even seem to be true to themselves. The authors note at the end says their story isn't over, but I hooe that when we see them again they are writren a better story.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|I can watch this movie a Billion times, and never get tired of it. It's just the best movie Ever. A Classic Richard Donner film. I love every minute of it. I got tired of Amazon and Netflix yanking this movie off their respective Instant Streaming Services, So I went ahead and Bought the Blu-ray. The visual quality is awesome for a movie almost 30 years old. I think it's the cleanest version ever, Some scenes I now see stuff that I couldn't ever see on the old VHS. I grew up watching this movie, and God willing, I will let my Kids do the same. I basically, also got this because the Digital versions always has a problem skipping frames. I can't stand missing frames. This version is as smooth as can possibly be. They would have to time warp back to the 80's and shoot the film with a Modern 3-D camera to make it look any better.

0738737909|3.0|When I bought the Tarot Illuminati, I assumed two things: 1. It was about the Illuminati (or, at the very least, secret symbolism through the ages) 2. It was designed under the guidance of the author, Kim Huggens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was wrong on both counts. Not only is this deck not about secret societies or symbols, but also it was created before the author came on board for the project. (I found this out via the companion booklet, which states that the \\"panicked\\" illustrator needed an author to pen the text in a matter of weeks, so took to Facebook to put out a call to writers).<br /><br />Although author Kim Huggens attempts to perpetuate the aura of \\"secret symbols\\" by saying the full-length companion book (Tarot Illuminati Revealed [[ASIN:B00CS73IA2 Complete Guide to Tarot Illuminati]], available separately and only digitally) illuminates the multiple symbols embedded in each card, the sample chapter on the High Priestess--included at the end of the companion book--reveals merely the usual Rider-Waite-Smith motifs (moon, pillars, scroll, etc.).<br /><br />The 160-page companion book to the Tarot Illuminati is full-color with glossy pages--a lovely presentation (despite spelling errors such as \\"peek\\" instead of \\"peak\\"), with each card's text giving a \\"voice\\" to its meaning (i.e. a first person narrative), as well as about a dozen Themes and Concepts (key phrases). I enjoyed the fresh take on the cards, a dialogue with the reader, even though the imagery itself is the same old Rider-Waite-Smith posing.<br /><br />Some of the card images by Erik C. Dunne are stunning and vibrant, but the mishmash of CGI, cartoonish illustration and cut-and-paste collage has a jarring, skewed result. Some of the heads and hands are too small or large for the figures, and the photorealistic backgrounds (or actual photos) with detailed foreground smashes the planes together for a flat effect. (In sophisticated art, the background is more muted or faded, which produces visual depth). Some images are quite pixely (brown horse in The Chariot) and others appear to have design flaws (the vertical line going right down the middle of The Hierophant).<br /><br />The Minor Arcana suits are conveyed with four ethnic groups/eras: Wands are Persian, Pentacles are Asian, Swords are Elizabethan England and cups are a \\"fantasy culture\\". Court Cards are Princesses, Princes, Queens and Kings. Huggens attributes Earth, Air, Water and Fire to each respective designation, but some Tarotists like myself attribute Fire to Knights (Princes) and Air to Kings (Kings)--and, really, this information unnecessarily complicates the text, especially for a general companion book.<br /><br />While the opulent trappings of the cards--including shiny gilt edging and borderless imagery--will no doubt enamor some, the Tarot Illuminati just doesn't work for me (nor anyone I showed it to). I love the sturdy, magnetic box with the flip top lid and the looks of the slick companion book--Huggens truly has a gift for storytelling and her key phrases are excellent--but these positive elements aren't enough for me to like, or recommend, the deck itself. I've tried reading with it, and it says nothing to me.<br /><br />There is truly nothing new here in terms of imagery, but if you like your Rider-Waite-Smith iconography warmed over for the millionth time via cluttered illustrations and bright colors, then you may want to give this deck a try.<br /><br />TO SEE 18 IMAGES FROM THIS DECK, VISIT THE REVIEWS--DECKS SECTION AT JANETBOYER.COMl depth).

1441856617|4.0|Again I thought I was purchasing an unabridged book - received the abridged edition.  I really don't like the Readers Digest version of any book.
B0052OZJQO|5.0|A stunning soundtrack that works just as well as an album as it did with the dance numbers. Wim Wenders does the best job of any director I know in pulling the exact right sound to score a film with. I love this album! It's upbeat,makes me want to move.

B002LMV7TS|5.0|This is a classic to me. I have to watch it every Christmas. Very family friendly but has some adult humor too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when is version 0.7.1 going to come out? its already out on the IOS so why isn't it out on the kindle fire???? plz come out with it. SOON!!
1609611543|5.0|One of the most powerful books I have read. It has changed how I eat. The result  is I feel the best I have felt in years - less joint pain, fewer headaches, no intestinal problems  and have lost 25 pounds.

B00008S7KC|5.0|Excellent. Only thing was the disc was loose in the case. But was great to see it :) Thanks Glad to add it to my collection again
B00BU18U82|5.0|The game is Yet the great game. It got me through 5 or 6 hours and I am still not borad with it. I recommend this game. The thing is that you have to buy some of the equipment with real money or coins $ but I still strongly recommend this game is one of those games you have to get.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|like the author says up front--it's a book for people who want to believe what he is about to &#34;prove.&#34;
B002RV01QI|5.0|I was looking for some nice relaxing music to put on my Ipod and this CD really fit the bill.  Then I put this CD in my car for those times when I need to decompress after work.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Great show and the DVD came with very good quality! This show is a must watch, so addictive, you will love it
B000050XEI|5.0|I had been looking for this CD for a couple of years.  I owned this one previously and I used to use it all the time in my relaxation work with children.  After time the CD simply became worn out and I had to get rid of it.  I became very upset when I couldn't find a store to replace the CD but Amazon came to the rescue and I am happy to have this in my collection for work again.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|This guy Is really taking the paths least traveled. I like it. Not exactly what you have come to expect but not unpleasant, either. I applaud anyone taking chances and here some of the results are haunting and beautiful
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Ok, so when I bought this book I was skeptical, because I'm one of those people who are not emotional at all. So love novels are not really my type but I decided that since this novel was rated so greatly and I liked Looking For Alaska, I would read it. I'm glad I did. It has the perfect combination between love and actual writing, if you know what I mean.<br />John Green is an amazing writer in my opinion and Ill be reading more of his work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey people you should agree or do what Juan said ,yolo you only live once we can be active and healthy and then you can go ahead and play minecraft thank you
B0012GTZC0|3.0|It was good (I wish I knew how to give a half star more) just a bit to slow at the beginning for me.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This completes my collection.  I already had MIB 1 and 2, so this completes my collection.  I love Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones together.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I LOVE these 2 characters. But, what a huge disappointment this book turned out to be. I kept reading in hopes I would receive some closure and then it just ended. I wouldn't have read it knowing that.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I like that Gary D Chapman recognizes that LOVE is a choice which ultimately is what will bring restoration to any relationship.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series is on my all times favorite lists. The steamy scenes leave me breathless and the plot lines keep me on the edge of my seat. The ending of this particular book though was just so abrupt though that I felt like 'WTH' at the end. It was like funding had ended abruptly. No cliffhanger ending but more like a mid-sentence ending. Story was still great and I will still be holding my breath waiting for the next installment. So I'd say the abrupt end to the book didn't deter me just seemed more odd than anything. I love this couple though and can relate to their struggles for normalcy when their two pasts have left such staggering scars. Want to know all the answers to all the questions I still have and even see the side character's story. Amazingly gifted author and will continue to look for her books.
B009AMANBA|5.0|No need for a long review.  This movie was everything I hoped for.  While I'm no position to reliably judge the 'accuracy' of the movie, I trust that it gives a good sense of the times Lincoln lived in, what he went through during the civil war, and what kind of person and President he was.  A moving and powerful story told well, of course with a very bittersweet ending.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|I've got all the previous series and like them all.  The storyline is winding down and not as suspenseful as previous years, but is still enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game to play! Super easy to play and the activities are relevant and entertaining. I wish it were easier to attain different horses though.
B008CRC506|5.0|I am one of the legions on SMASH fans who were devastated by the recent cancellation of this TV show, so being able to have it on DVD (waiting for season 2!) is a big consolation...
B000JMKQX0|4.0|While I found the crude language off-putting, the approach was imaginative and well thought out. A fine, quick read that was surprisingly engaging.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Not scary at all. Don't waste your money in this one. This is a pass, horror ,NOOOOOTTTT. This movies was too long for the boring ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game I sometimes play it all day. If your thinking about getting it do it.
B0036JU6CY|3.0|Action packed from beginning to end. It was fun  and not to long. Acting was ok. This is a good movie to relax if you enjoy martial arts movies.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Spoiler alert, fair warning!<br /><br />I have been a total supporter of this series from Book one. Actually, chapter one of book one. I love the characters of Eva and Gideon. At times they can be cheesy (aren't all romance novels) but overall I thought they were fantastic. I even recommended this series more than Fifty Shades of Grey! I waited for MONTHS for Entwined with you, as did many other readers and I have to say that I am incredibly disappointed.<br /><br />Typically a story has a beginning, middle and end. A plot with a conflict and a resolution. NOPE! Not this one! There were random conflict points thrown in and teeny tiny resolutions (sex!) and that was about it. I kept waiting for Eva to get pregnant, or Brett to do something crazy, or Gideon to go to jail or Megumi even to end up dead or something crazy with the way that lead on, but no! Nothing. Just a bunch of stuff that the poor couple kept dragging through.<br /><br />Apparently there will be two more books and I will not read them. Three is good and this book could have been great. I wanted to read about Eva and Gideon starting their married life together and having a family, or doing something awesome. Instead we don't even find out what Cary will do about knocking up Tatiana, or get to see it all go down when they officially announce their engagement to the world. I do not know if this was a lapse in judgement or what was going on, and I refuse to see the bad in an author, as many people are accusing Sylvia Day of being money hungry. Whatever, I'm sure she has enough money after the first two books. I can say that I really think that a lot of people are unhappy about this book and where this is going and I have a hard time seeing books 4 and 5 (!) selling at all.<br /><br />Oh, and I gave it 2 stars for the sex scenes...they were pretty good. If it weren't for those, it would have gotten only one. Two is actually pretty generous, honestly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Although I liked &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; a bit better, this book was very entertaining and kept me up at night reading to find out what happens to the &#34;victors&#34;.  The third book in the series was a bit of a let down, but I had to read it to its conclusion to see how it all comes to an end.
B008220BP2|4.0|i did not think this would be a guy movie. i did enjoy the movie so if you have the time i say give it a go and i think you will enjoy this movie.
159562015X|5.0|Strengths Finder 2.0 has the tools to help me look at what I do naturally well in a positive light. It shines this light in new directions to help me appreciate and understand my talent and direct it in ways that are useful and comfortable.
B00BBA6FMU|3.0|Entertaining, one of the better books I have read in years. Was difficult to put down. Great author. Get it.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|good game o might even go see the moive. like how the game is played recommented for young and old.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Funny, entertaining, one of the best books I have read in years. Was difficult to put down. Great author. Get it.
0307200477|5.0|This was a gift for a friend who had a library-themed shower and in lieu of cards, you were expected to bring a book. This was my childhood favorite so I picked this one. I'm glad I spent a little more on the deluxe edition. It came in a nice box with a clear front to it.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Over all it is good but it does no good if the app wont stay on my current location or at the very least let me set a main location. I think this is a huge oversite.
B005M4EM5S|5.0|This book started out a little confessing but after I got into it and understood a little of what was going on I started to really enjoy it. I will go through it again and will probably get allot more out of it. Anyone that has started this but quit you really should go back to it. It will be worth it. The bad thing is that it has been along time since book one came out the next one will come out Nov. 2013. I went through The Wheel of Time series, which was fantastic, but another 10 plus years. It is hard to be patient enough to go through another series but I am already hooked.
B004UID2LC|1.0|i don't know who came up with this app for kindle but I hate it.  Its a waste of time...
B009M588K8|3.0|This book, as it turns out, is about a lot more than just the capturing and killing of Osama bin Laden. It's a most interesting read but at the end of the day, it's about people being made into killing machines and how they've accomplished the kills as have been assigned to them. It is not uplifting or inspirational to those of us who believe we should get out of other countries and stop violently forcing our ways on them.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app all the time. It helps me get to sleep! I love the variety of sounds. Rain is<br />My favorite
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a book I should have had in physical form as often I was tempted to go back to reread previous parts. He lost me a few times as he moved to different characters in a different time.Very Clever. Looking forward to another book by Dr. Hosseini. I have now read all of his works, I realize  a good book  takes time and I will wait.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has come in handy more than a few times when I have not been close to my physical calculator. And best of all it was FREE! No complaints here!
B004QMRHHW|4.0|I got this and as my friend had said it is slightly heavier than their last album but I enjoyed it. It's a great album and worth the buy
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this app it's cool to do the hair and makeup. And I love how you Can dress them in the end
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|So frustrated by the reviews. I get it. It was supposed to be a trilogy. But maybe in writing the last book she discovered she wasn't done with them and frankly I'm glad! I'd love to see where Gideon and Eva's lives are headed. I read the book in two days. Another great read! Thanks Sylvia!! :
193700788X|3.0|I was disappointed with this one. The action wasn't as exciting as past books and without spoilers, I'll just say the ending left me flat.
B00C0IYIN0|3.0|I give this 3 stars not because of the movie....this is one of my all time favorite movies. However, I would not spend the extra money to pay for HD quality. I should have been smart enough to realize that an 80s movie wouldn't have HD quality, but alas, I caved and purchased it anyway. Long story short, AMAZING movie but grainy on a large screen....even though is it &#34;HD.&#34;
B001W63DX2|5.0|During the interview sections that were on the documentary version of this film what was the blues tune that ADRIAN SMITH was playing in his dressing room as a warmup practice session?
B00APJLFEG|3.0|there are some good laughs here, but the plot is predictable and full of unnecessary holes, the voice acting is basically a list of cameos from big name comedy with only  Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg standing out with any real character.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use. Sharpens the mind and helps with frustration. It's a relief when I win. I recommend this game for the young and old. A great way to pass time.
0440246318|4.0|A wanted Man by Lee Child was just what I needed after reading four books in a row that weren't so great.  I read a lot, so when I get a string of poorly executed ideas I get really cranky and irregular.  Two of those books were by well known authors, so I was relieved to find Reacher, being Reacher.  I read the reviews panning the book and don't quite understand where they are coming from, I thought it was great.  The bad guys had a really awesome hideout, the women were INTELLIGENT and attractive and Reacher played the game by his own rules, as usual.  There was a lot of car travel, but enough was going on to keep it interesting.  Lee Child is a wonderful writer and Reacher is a great character so I am hoping if the author is looking for a change, he will just let Reacher catch up on his sleep while he invents other characters to lead us through the literary landscape of escape fiction.  I need people like Child writing books to keep my world rocked!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I&acute;ve tried all the Youtube apps in Amazon's app store and this one is the best.  Other apps have playback issues, are slow to navigate or don't integrate well with your Youtube account.  This app is nearly perfect.  The only issue I have with it is that it doesn't seem to show related videos.  It's a small price to pay for such an awesome app though and is a better choice than anything else out there.
B00BB67UNW|5.0|a good action movie russell crowe is always great mark walberg is also very good loved some of his action movies
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The Tom Clancy novels have lacked a little in recent years.  This one has everything we have grown to love about the Clancy techno-thriller.  Good plot, real technical stuff- the virus and trojan threats to critical infrastructure are real and if anything underplayed. Characters to care about, characters who betray characters you care about, real nasty bad guys, threat of global war, thrills, kills and not so happy endings.  Good stuff.<br />When you read this novel remember that there are images floating around on the web of a 4th generation Chinese fighter prototype being tested that looks identical to the F-35 fighter.  Rumour has it based on designs stolen from Lockheed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I Would definitely recommend this book. It is a bit on the edgy side but I could not put it down.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I have a ZTO 9&#34; tablet that I got for cheap its not the top of the line tablet but it does what I need the browser that was the default kept locking up and would not respond and getting between pages was a pain in the neck this browser with actual tabs is awesome.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing! I have been a Legend of Zelda fan since I was a child (NES days) and this book explores every bit of the series nicely. I love the artwork and stories included in it. Great buy for any collector. Well worth the money.
B008JFUP0I|1.0|This is a horrible movie with horrible acting.  Spend your money on something better.  I walked out of the theatre.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|If you like to drive to very chill music, this is the album for you. I bought this album two weeks ago, and have listened to it NON-STOP. Each song flows into the next and you can't help but sing along. I 1000% recommend buying the album.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Clear, concrete and inspiring read. I read it almost nonstop and I have since started to plan my own business. True to his word.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I did not know what to expect with this book - it was written long before the age of my preferred reading. I am surprised at the emotion and amazement I felt at the twists of the story. Excellent writing and incredible imagination. I can't wait to read the next installment of Ender's story.
B00AK57N00|5.0|I thought this game would suck. I looked at the reviews. And thought I'd buy it. I thought hey at least my baby brother would like it. But then I started playing the game. I got rid of the guy talking and turned other things down in menu and turned the music all the way up. And started playing, then thought this isn't that bad. Then wen I thought I'd only Been playing for a couple of minutes 2 hours a had went by. I now think I'm  obsessed. This is the best game on kindle fire ever created. I've only Been playing a day and a half and my high score is 25,890 get it you'll love it. O O<br />　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　ー　<br />異　手ぇ　別　下　異!

B00CH87HF4|4.0|I don't really like demons but this game was highly entertaining in many ways. But as we now Free is never really free. Once you run out of diamonds you must pay for them. But you do not need diamonds to play the game, you just have too be really patient. And it is not for kids 7 and under. You get to choose your own name and witch type you want to be swordsman, mage, archer and a man with a really big sword. I suggest you upgrade your weapon like 5 times. You will not have a choice to be evil or good. You will all ways be good. There are also demons in it that you kill by ripping them open and blood going every were.
B00992CF6W|1.0|First of all, I REALLY love this game. But guess what, I can't get the update for my kindle.  I asked my mom if I could freaking get an ipad and switch to Google play and get the dang thing. But apparently it costs too much.  Y'all have a good tablet price I'll give you that, but seriously, give us the update or I could get other kindle users to sign a petition.  That is all for amazon.  Now mojang, you're slacking off with updates. But if it's just amazon's fault, sorry. (Btw this rating is temporary until the update)
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This is a basic where your foods come from 101! I wish more people would see this very important documentary.
B000002U88|2.0|I too was excited to see this finally getting the remaster treatment.  However when it arrived I immediately knew without even playing it, that it was not remastered.  If you order this CD you will get the 1983 version of the CD.  I was curious as to why the (Remaster) moniker so I did a little digging.  It appears that Capital had plans, whether it was ever realized I don't know, to remaster this CD as a direct to CD offering.  That is where all the 2011 remaster stuff comes from.  The CD is not available anywhere I looked, and I looked hard.<br /><br />For the life of me I can not understand why Seger and Capital don't have a serious remaster release program for his recordings.  I mean they went ahead and remastered \\"Smokin' OP's\\" and it was available for a very short time but although \\"The Bob Seger System\\", \\"Mongrel\\", \\"Brand New Morning\\", \\"Back In \\"72\\" and \\"Seven\\" may have been available back in the early days of the CD, they have not been apart of the Seger CD catalog for decades.  And although \\"Beautiful Loser\\" is widely available, it has never been remastered.  So that leaves \\"Live Bullet\\", \\"Nightmoves\\", \\"Against The Wind\\" and \\"Nine Tonight\\" as the only other true remasters.  Now we have \\"Early Seger Vol. 1\\" to fill in some gaps in the remastered Seger saga.  \\"The Distance\\" was the last truely GREAT Seger album and every one I listed DESERVES to be remastered.  The sound quality of this CD is pure 1983 which means it SUCKS BIG TIME.  The mastering technology of the times simply had not caught up with the delivery system.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice game. A bit confusing to start but improves if one sticks with it. Trouble getting online with Kindle Fire HD to make friends. I'm hoping I can discover  how to make friends.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|this is for kids, and the ads are terrible.<br /><br />I will think twice before downloading a Disney game<br /><br />Not Fun
B006LSZECO|1.0|I heard so much about this book, that I was dying to read it.  But, page after page, I struggled to keep interested.  A friend told me to stick with it and it would eventually hook me.  It did...but not until half way through when the mystery is revealed.  Then, after finally committing to the story, I was completely let down by the ending.  For such a great plot idea, I'm shocked this ending was all the author could come up with.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It has come out its the best we finally has buckets even though it 7.00 dollars it's totally worth it best game ever

1932100660|5.0|I became a vegetarian/vegan from a religious perspective. And saw the tremendous health gain. From a Buddhist Mahayana perspective, eating meat constitutes killing according to the Shurangama Sutra. The retribution for killing is also killing. I interpret this is as by eating lower level organisms, we succumb to sickness easier. From the perspective of some Buddhist teachers, this retribution for killing takes place life after life. According to a Buddhist Teacher, within the chinese character for meat, there is 2 humans. One is trying to get out and the other is not letting him to get out.

B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Modern day horror movies are so predictable and more of a joke than scary. I love the fact that this is not in your face gore blood and scream. I like Horror movies that get deep inside your inner fears and amplifys them. This movie did just that for me. It toyed and taunted with my mind. I saw this movie the first time in the theater and it shook me up that night I went home and had to wait for my girl to come home. That fear wore off after a while. I just recently purchased the blu ray copy of this and watched it again. Those fears I thought were gone, came right back. This is one of those movies where i will not watch alone in the dark by my self. This movie will sit on my dvd rack until I find others to watch it with. It is creepy scary. I highly recommend you purchase a copy. Loved it...Good luck.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wonderfully complex; I could literally feel my neurons firing! Loved this game! Cannot wait for the next game to come out!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a genius that our media and government did not believe or use his knowledge. The big robber barons of business like him for what they could dwindle from him, but hated him because he wanted to share it with the world not profit from it.<br />Even with his notes the US government has not been able to reproduce or advance on his theories and findings.<br />Feels was so far ahead of his time his advanced thinking was not understood or embraced. A true genius. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I love Shinedown and this is a great cd! A must have for all of their fans, great lyrics too.
B000J1AGQI|2.0|Its a good movie for entertainment, like some John Wayne movie, but pretty far from what happened according to the book. Im surprised Hal Moore didn't kind of disclaim it since it made him look like John Wayne killing dozens of enemy single handidly, which of course did not happen. Especially the big charge scene at the end which was ridiculous. Not to mention the second part of the actual battle at LZ Albany was much worse  and Moore wasn't even there.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really Like this app. It also helps that it is in 3-D. Is very realistic. I just hope there are more games like this coming.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|GREAT book and GREAT movie.  Recommend both of them.  My only regret is that I put off reading the book too long!  In the same vein, I recommend Cloud Atlas (book and movie) for those who liked Life of Pi.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was assigned this book as a summer English assignment. Before I even starting reading, I assumed the book to be tremendously boring. However; I'll just about-it and say I started this book today, but I have hardly been able to put it down all day. This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone (granted you have a very large vocabulary or a dictionary on-hand). Definitely going to write a praising essay on this one! :)

0062059963|5.0|I absolutely loved The Selection and The Elite had me hooked just as much as the first book. It was a wonderful mix of fantasy and dystopian concepts.<br /><br />America is a really tough character but she gets scared of what the end of the selection will mean for her, and that's really what this book is about. Either she wins and then she's the future queen and she doesn't know if she can handle that responsibility - if she can be a leader when so many of her ideals conflict with how the country is actually run, or she loses which would mean Maxon never cared for her like she did for him, and she really does love him. And then there's always the third option of dropping out to avoid becoming queen, and heartbreak from Maxon, and returning home to be with Aspen.<br /><br />America has a lot of doubts about Maxon in this book, partly because he keeps some things from her, and there were times when I was frustrated with America's paranoia and rash decisions. But considering her situation I think these emotions were perfect. She does lash out and in turn make some bad decisions - decisions that she doesn't think through or consider the consequences of, but I think it would have been unrealistic had she done anything else. It was obvious to me that Maxon wanted her the most, but being in that situation where she's competing with all of these other girls for his attention I believed that she would feel unsure at times and question his motives.<br /><br />I also enjoyed that we got to see so much more of Maxon's character. He can be this perfect gentleman, caring, and wholesome, even a little naive at times; but there's more to him than that. We see in this book that he's not perfect, that he makes some questionable decisions as well, and that his life hasn't been as easy as America has thought it was. This competition is wearing on him as well.<br /><br />I was glad to see America work out her feelings by the end of this book. The love triangle in the first book didn't feel that strong to me and I was glad to see that America wasn't going to continue to string someone along in the third book. She does give both Maxon and Aspen mixed signals throughout the book, but I could understand why.<br /><br />Like in the first book I liked the relationships between the girls, and I'm particularly interested to see how America and Kriss' relationship continues in the third book, or if we'll see more of Marlee.<br /><br />Overall I cannot wait for the conclusion of this trilogy, The One, and highly recommend this book.eel that strong to me and I was glad to see that America wasn't going to continue to string someone along in the third book.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Although it is obvious that this book was written by someone with a 5th grade education, the message she sends is one of an old soul. The story will bring tears to your eyes and put your stomach in knots, but it is amazing to know that she was able to survive such torture. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to read her story.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|I am very interested in art---especially old masterpieces.  this game was so entertaining that I had trouble knowing when to stop playing and stayed up late bidding.  loved this game.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|I read several reviews on the older versions of this product all stating they had software problems. I decided to go with this one thinking those issues had been resolved. Unfortunately, this product still has some kinks to be worked out. I downloaded all my songs and I was able to hear the music playing. I went to use it in the water the next day and the device completely froze. I am extremely disappointed that i had to send it back as I think this would be a great addition to any water workout!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app you can see how much battery life you have left and  see where it is going
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Just as a point of argument, but did any of you reviewers stop to think that the \\"book 4 & 5\\" idea was not Sylvia's but her publisher???  They make money too and they are the ones who decide when the books are released. Just understand that there is a lot more going on behind the business end of our fabulous little past time than you might realize - so stop throwing the author under the bus -
B001EC2IXK|1.0|This movie was long and boring.  I gave it one star because I like Paul Newman.  Whoever came up with this story had nothing better to do.  What a waste of time!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting and waiting for this third book...and paying a ridiculous price for it, I feel cheated AND robbed. The next one better be offered at $0.99.  I am not a fan of the long, drawn out &#34;serial&#34;. Just deliver one nice long read with a beginning and an ending all for one fixed price.  I enjoyed the story writing, but not for the price of four (?) books and too many months in between.  I think I will just write my own ending and be done.
0312330537|2.0|This book is a tough slog. It's a sentimental, unfocused mess and I only finished it because I kept waiting for the brilliance promised by the other reviewers and the couple of friends who've read it. The dime-store philosophy and over-wrought romantic cheese was difficult to take seriously. Most of the time I read a book and find something to admire in it but not this one. I didn't care about the protagonist, disliked the writing style, was turned off by the glorification of gang violence and irritated by treacly descriptions of the love interest. I simply have no idea why so many people think this is one of the best books they've ever read. If any of them are reading this review I'd suggest they get themselves a copy of Pride and Prejudice, Of Human Bondage, Anna Karenina or any number of unforgettable books that will be worth reading. Truly, I'm sorry for the bad review but this book was appalling.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|The battling could be a little more epic...  but awesome game platform. It's pretty addicting!  I think the graphics are pretty good too!

0316776963|1.0|Not interesting at all. Very boring and blah. Didn't really care to read it any more after the first chapter.
0151003084|3.0|The drawings and art is great, its just a very small book, with regular paper and black ink, I just think its overpriced, its also very short, a few pages long<br />Wouldn't buy it again
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I really liked the DVD's and felt they tried to be open and honest - never making themselves above  the same human experiences that we all have. The tell the good and the bad and it was all masterfully filmed/ edited.

B00821OX98|3.0|Seems like a two hr movie turned into a series, same things over and over. The kids w/ the alien backpacks? Boring.......
030746363X|2.0|I ordered this book because a friend recommended it.  But really?  It sounds like Atkins on ice.  It is a very extreme and not very scientifically backed approach to weight loss and supposed good health.<br /><br />Sometime in the '60s Gypsy Boots also recommended dunking your body in cold water daily in his book &#34;Barefeet and Good Things to Eat.&#34;  But he really did recommend good foods.<br /><br />Sorry, I am gracious in giving this 2 stars.

0345525558|5.0|I've read quite a few books lately, but I have been struggling to find one I like well enough to recommend in this column.  At last I have found it with The Language of Flowers: A Novel.<br /><br />It is Victoria's eighteenth birthday.  Rather than celebrate with cake and candles like most adolescents, Victoria receives an indifferent kick to the curb.  Victoria is a ward of the state, raised in multiple foster homes and group homes until she is unceremoniously \\"emancipated\\" on her 18th birthday (which is not likely her actual date of birth since she was abandoned as an infant).  She is able to carry everything she owns with her in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Nestled amongst hand-me-down clothing that never really fit her, Victoria's box contains her most prized possession; a dictionary defining the sentiments expressed by each flower.  Victoria despises red roses, which represent love.  She feels better represented by thistle, which conveys misanthropy.<br /><br />Despite the enormous obstacles before her, Victoria perseveres with the help of flowers.  She has never enjoyed school, never had the best behavior, and has no friends to speak of, but Victoria has always taken comfort in flowers and the secret messages that they can convey.  Her knowledge of flowers allows her to secure a job at a flower store.<br /><br />Even as Victoria uses flowers to help others accomplish their goals of reconnecting with loved ones or finding romance, flowers also force her to interact with others in meaningful ways.  Witnessing her tentatively experience friendship and romance for the first time is touching and believable.<br /><br />Interwoven in the story of Victoria's present is the story of her past and how she lost the one foster mother who loved her unconditionally.<br /><br />At times absolutely raw, this book is also, against all odds, uplifting and hopeful.

159514188X|4.0|I'm a clinical psychologist and I'm in favor of books that draw attention to the importance of preventing teen suicides.  I think this book really promotes an important message, which is be careful how you treat other people.  You never know how your actions, especially careless words or criticisms, might have a big, perhaps a permanent, impact on somebody else.<br /><br />Clay Jensen has just received a box of audiotapes.  On the tapes, Hannah Baker explains how thirteen people contributed to her decision to take her own life.  Clay is one of them.  And now he must listen to all the tapes to learn how his actions have made an impact upon Hannah.<br /><br />The writing bounces back and forth between the words Hannah recorded before her suicide and the actions of Clay as he listens to them.  It is an interesting approach.<br /><br />As Clay listens to the tapes, he (and the reader) learn how the actions of fellow students (sometimes seemingly minor actions) caused a snowball effect that left Hannah feeling hopeless enough to take her own life.<br /><br />While I love that this book encourages readers to be sensitive to others and not to promote idle gossip or steroetypes, I didn't love it as much as I had hoped.  Too much of the content seemed contrive or untrue to me.  Hannah being determined and assertive enough to record the tapes and manipulate others into reading them is consistent with the powerlessness she was attempting to convey.  And I struggle with her refusal to accept offers of help that were available to her.  Though this is not inconsistent with the distorted thinking of suicidal people, I found the book put too much onus on others in a very blaming style.<br /><br />Still, this is an excellent premise and an important topic.  If this book gets more people to contemplate their own actions and behaviors and exercise more kindness to others . . . that's something that I can really endorse!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow what a great ending. Just when i thought this was the final book. I can't wait till book #4.

1439170916|4.0|The subtitle provides a most accurate description of the book: \\"A biography of cancer\\". Siddhartha Mukherjee is a cancer doctor who takes us to a compelling journey to the desperate world of cancer, one of the most feared illnesses. The story begins in the first documented historical sightings of what might be cancer, an Egyptian hieroglyph (2500 BC) from the time of Imontap. The next jump in time is to a Persian queen named Atossa (500 BC) who might have suffered from a breast cancer, and we continue to the Greek slaves and eventually to our own time (around 1850- until today), where the story starts to delve into modern time medical reality.<br /><br />The book is almost 500 pages long with the first 100 pages or so looks at its history, and the other 400 provides a detailed description of the research effort in the last 150 years. The research effort is wide and spans many areas, and it is very interesting to see the changes in the perception of the illness and possible treatments as research progresses. It is not far fetch to believe that people living in the year 2050 will look down at the primitive treatment that is currently available (that is in 2013).<br /><br />Cancer is one of the most interesting illness and apparently one of the hardest to cure for two main reasons: The first being that fact that there are many different types. Where even within the same type (e.g. blood cancer), there are different subtypes that are classified by the difference in the mutated genes.  The second reason is due to the fact that cancer cells are hard to target without harming the normal cells in the patient body. In other words, we're looking for a \\"smart\\" missile that will target only the evil cells.<br /><br />The book provides a very interesting account of the creativity of the researchers in finding ways to deal with cancer. From traumatic operation that digs a large part of the body, to various toxics that kills every cells including the normal ones, and to the most recent advances in the molecular level that study specific genes (often muted) and tries to find a way to suppress their activity.<br /><br />The book is highly interesting, (especially in its early parts) but my main criticism is that it is very *hard* book to read, almost frustratingly hard. Writing to a general audience is a skill that seems to be missing from the author (and editor) of this book. There are many popular science books on topics that are harder to explain (e.g. Quantum Physics), but for some reason this particular book seems to enjoy writing in a complex medical language for no reason. It tends to use complex medical terms that most readers (including me of course) do not fully understand. Moreover, even after encountering a complex medical term and understanding it once following a short internet search, they will probably won't remember it accurately in the next chapter.  There is a short glossary at the end of the book, but I kept finding myself going to a nearby Internet connection to look for the meaning of various terms. For examples, \\"Carcinogenesis\\" (or Oncogenesis in other places), \\"Proto-oncogene\\", \\"Metastatic\\", and many others. The problem is getting worst in the last 100 pages, where without a descent knowledge in Biology and a good memory of the medical terms, you won't be able to understand the text in depth. I found myself very frustrated in that part of the book, as the reading became really cumbersome and not very enjoyable.<br /><br />Anyway, for those we are willing to delve into the complex medical jargon, and do want to learn a great deal about Cancer, this book will meet their needs.ecent advances in the molecular level that study specific genes (often muted) and tries to find a way to suppress their activity.<br /><br />The book is highly interesting, (especially in its early parts) but my main criticism is that it is very *hard* book to read, almost frustratingly hard.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is not nearly as advanced as the pc version, but it is still great.  With version 0.7.1 about to be released, we will be seeing realms worldwide servers, buckets, cake ,eggs, spawn eggs and more.  The world size may be small, and there aren't caves, endermen, redstone, wolves, ocelots, or jungles or the nether, but the game is still a work in progress.  Minecraft pe is an awesome app that is fun for almost everybody.  You can build, craft, explore, hunt , mine for ores and more with this app.  Minecraft pe has many of the mobs in the pc version, such as the iconic creeper.  The nether is not available, but you can create a nether reator which spawns a huge netherack tower, zombie pig men, and many items like melon seeds, mushrooms and cactus.  I give this app a five out of five rating because of its amazing graphics, epicness and because its minecraft.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books but this one was such a letdown. The story was slow and unfocused, characters that had a place in the first two were pushed in to supporting cast, supporting cast were forced into parts that do not make sense. And now i hear there will be two more books! Well as a fan please PLEASE fixthe main character Eva, she was a strong and flawed woman you wanted happiness for now she lives in drama of her own making while getting nailed to the wall every other paragraph. Gideon has lost his purpose in the story other than to sleep with Eva. Cary, Mark, her parents,and his mom have all become pawns in Eva's need for attention. Only now their competing with characters like Brett, Will,Deanna (who serves NO purpose at all!), and Menumi (or whatever her name is). Oh and the creation of a vilan couple in the form of the Lucas' …please what a let down!

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book. I gave it five stars. I believe that everyone should read it. I might read it again.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I enjoyed the interlinked stories and the structure of this book, but at various points it does feel quite disjointed (which I took to be the purpose).<br /><br />Some parts were page turners for me, but other parts of the book slowed down considerably.  I think if you really like to read for the pleasure of reading, you will probably enjoy this book.  But if you like tight, fast, page turning action with a clearly defined plot, this one may irritate you.<br /><br />Even still, I found that I quite enjoyed this, much to my surprise, even though at the end of the book I almost felt as if something was lacking.  It is possible I missed something during the book that left me with that lack, however, as I read with a preschooler hanging at my heels these days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it but I would want the game screen saver Change to the game .I would like to have the characters to have 100+  clothes<br /><br /> ps.I give this review 5 stars<br /><br />sincerely,destiny
B00127RAJY|5.0|She truly is TV's toughest trainer! At first I had a very hard time on level 1 (even following the modified gal). Within a week it got easier and I was able to follow the other girl. I have been doing it for about a month (about 3-4 times a week) and don't feel that I am ready for the next level yet. The training is vigorous but I like how she has you do 2 minutes of each section (strength, cardio and abs). Just when I feel like giving up, she has you move onto another move.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was surprised that there was such a cliff hanger for an ending, then learned that there's at least one if not two more books coming out in the series.  So many people are complaining because she didn't finish the story in three books, I like to read and love the story, so I'm thrilled that there's two more books coming!  The book only covers a couple days to a week, so you don't get far with the story (which is a little frustrating thus the four stars and not five), but so much happens in those few days, I don't think anything was wasted or drawn out.<br />And to the people complaining about the changing publishing date - the author had nothing to do with it, she even tried to get the publishers to stick to their first date, but in the end the publishers made the decision.  Don't bash the author or the book for a poor move on the publishers part.  It's still a great book, no matter how long I had to wait to read it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a good program. A little too fast, but very entertaining.  A nice diversion, with interesting locations and items to collect.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|The perfect recording of these old time songs by top artists, makes them very pleasant to hear again and again. I started playing Beatles songs with the guitar since 1964 like \\"I should have known better\\" and \\"And I Love her\\" as a very young kid and up to now I still play them. It would be my wild fantasy to play these old favorites with Paul and take photos and send to all my cousins and nephews who are mostly musicians playing in the band. My daughter 23 yrs old loves to hear these \\"Kisses on the bottom\\" CD while we eat dinner by the back patio facing the lake. It's amazing that from one generation to another generation Paul can attract listeners. My 16 yrs old boy can sing along with these Beatles songs as well.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|We have two homes 1000 miles apart & always bring our Kindles with us as we go from house to house. We each keep a charger in both house plus an additional one in a suitcase when we travel. The chargers do what they are supposed to do, and at a low cost to buy and to operate.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and I am indeed excited that this was not the end regardless of the word trilogy!  I do wish it would have ended a little differently but I was still satisfied with the storyline.  My only wish is that we do not have to wait another 6 months to read the next book.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Every bit the rope that we expect. The characters are great and the games take some thinking and engineering. Have fun.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Seems very good ... I'm not sure it's working but, it seems to be.  I assume it works by disabling all APPS until I bring them up.  I thought they were all disabled when I closed out of them but, apparently not.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so excited about the final installment.  I really thought I'd get my HEA or at least a conclusion.  Well that didn't happen. A whole lot of nothing happened.  We got to learn way too much about characters that I have absolutely no interest in.  Who cares about Megumi and Corinne.  I kept seeing so many parallels with the characters from Fifty Shades.  Corinne was like the nutty sub.  Megumi has become the workplace weirdo. Something is going on with her that I'm sure we'll hear about in books 4 or 5  There is also the child abuse issues with the billionaire male characters.  There's the premature proposal and wedding. Also let's not forget the mysterious red head (another crazy).  The most annoying similarity was Eva's safe word \\"crossfire\\" (what was Anna's word I forget).  Nothing happened other than the fact that they made up and had lots of sex. I really used to like Eva (oops had accidentally typed Anna)and Gideon but now I'm just sick of their neediness and obsession with each other.  I feel like I was riped off. The ending just sucked.  I got no story but a lot of disappointment and frustration. My reading time was wasted on a lot of nothing (sex and being needy).  I really wish authors would stop prolonging stories to please fans or for money. I signed up for a trilogy not what this has become.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Helps with spelling, definitions, and in finding better words.  Also has a feature for vocabulary development and improved expression and writing.  It is indispensable.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I like this app. Only wish it would tell me correctly how much time is remaining. The picture does the trick though.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|fine acting, sad commentary on us all that we seek entertainment in kids killing each other for sport.  I get all the good things about the story, and the fine acting. still, it all left me feeling a bit sick to my stomach.  i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone; themes of love war and overcoming evil can and have been told in a manner less exploitative of our own youth.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've just finish The Fault in Our Stars and I've realized I've never been more moved by a novel then this one. There is a time of laughter but also sadness in this novel. It's extremely well written and I cannot stop raving about it please just do your self a favor and read it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|There is no suggestions I have about improving this game. In my mind, it's a perfect game start to finish. I even like that this game doesn't go on forever, and there is an end to it.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It is so cool and fun. And while you play it you get to share your common or unique taste in style.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is a matching game (like Mahjong), but it's 3 dimensional, and you can rotate your cube in 3-D space. It's a nice twist on matching games. I found this game very fun and entertaining.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My kids are having so much fun with this game that I think my battery life may be affected from over use!:)!!
B00701L5XS|5.0|This app is very useful for learning how to tie various knots. It's a well designed app, and the visualizations are well done. You can rotate around the knots to study it, and there are videos that show how to loop the knots. 5 star app.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The plot is well known what with the movie but book is interesting and does make you wonder if anything is ok if we find it entertaining.  In a way Hunger Games can be viewed as ultimate reality tv.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|This is a very odd puzzle game. It make sense it was created a long time ago, but still, I found it all very odd and not a fun puzzler game.
B00001PE4D|1.0|I can't believe I watched the whole movie. I cannot recommend this movie for any reason. Sorry. It is that bad. I cannot believe Reese Witherspoon accepted this script.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|i find that i don't use this on a day-to-day basis, but it's still a neat app to have in my tool belt.
B00992CF6W|4.0|can not update on my friends ipod there was lava and water and eggs? how do you update if you know how please put a review
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|This is a fun helicopter simulation. It's not a bad game, but it is very simple. I got this as a FAOTD, so I shouldn't complain about it. Nevertheless, the missions got a little boring after a while, My main complaint is that there isn't much to explore in the world. I wish there were more rooms and levels. A variety of levels would make me rate this game higher.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is a cant miss trilogy.  Great action and excitement and Jason Bourne doesn't disappoint.  He is like a young me back in my spy days...I wish.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|this game helped me learn how to play Blokus. once i learned the basic strategy, the AI becomes extremely easy. i wish i could play this game against other people online, but that would be much more complex. great for a FAOTD.
055358894X|4.0|I picked this up because of the recommendation on the cover.  I say you need to be patient because the first half of the book didn't always make me want to turn the page, but as I got further into it it got better.  This is a good read with the finish being the best part.  I look forward to reading the follow up book.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|My wife already has four of her albums so I thought she might like this one. I wasn't wrong!  I don't think she can sing a bad song.
B009I5QU8O|5.0|I bought this because someone at work introduced me to electronic dance music and recommended these guys. I absolutely love it - and as an added side benefit, I can't stop moving when I listen to it :) so I am &#34;working out&#34; nonstop! This is a must have for every woman!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Pretty good game, addictive, easy to follow, good way to kill time.  Not a fan of it constantly asking me to post things to Facebook, which I won't do, wish I could remove that as an option.
B007BVMVDU|3.0|We have high speed internet fiber optic but the servers at Amazon are very slow.  Frustrating.  Reminds me of old days with broadcast tv.
1401322786|5.0|This Time Keeper book was great. It kept you wanting to read it every second! I couldn't put it down
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun game to play when you are  or at home bored.  You can also competer with your friends on line.. That is a game in itself..
B004DEW9L2|5.0|Okay, enough with the one-star reviews.  \\"Breathless\\" has earned its reputation as one of the great, genre-altering films of all time.  Why?  Because of its style.<br /><br />It's as if director Jean Luc Godard anticipated Marshall McLuhan and Andy Warhol.  In this film, 'the medium is the message', and surface is all that matters.  Attitude is everything.  Godard scrapped all the pretensions of storyline, stereotypical location shots and scene framing, and made a movie that engages the viewer, so he/she feels like one is witnessing something directly.  The movie doesn't give you a dazzling, foreign and aloof picture of Paris-- it gives you a Paris that is warm, immediate, and familiar.  Scenes appear uncontrived, and are allowed to happen, sometimes with ad-libs.  When there is a transition, as in late afternoon to evening, it comes with the flash of the streetlamps igniting in a row.  Simple, and brilliant.<br /><br />John Paul Belmondo starts the film with a line that Amazon won't allow me to repeat.  Suffice to say, it sets the tone, and is one of the greatest lines ever given to an anti-hero.  Belmondo brings a persona to the film similar to onethat the world would meet a few years later in the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger... charismatic, sophisticated, but cool to the point of uncaring.  Jean Seberg provides an anchor to the film, and an eerie beauty.  She plays a young woman in an experimental stage of her life, like a coed you might find in any dormitory in any college...only slightly more enigmatic.<br /><br />The camerawork is terrific, and integral to the attitude of the film.  There are many 'nod and wink' moments, as when a cavalcade of motorcycles passes, in arrow formations, left to right.  When a scrolling news message board says \\"the suspects capture is imminent\\", the audience is naturally briefed that the film is nearly at a close.  It's all about motion, pacing, flow, and just \\"being there\\".  Godard seemed to be saying, \\"You know its a movie, and Iknow its a movie.  I'll let you in on the joke.\\"  Moviemaking was never again quite the same.<br /><br />P.S.  Did I mention that there is a witty, faux-noir jazz score?  And finally, there is the most overacted and tragicomic death stagger in the history of film.  You can watch this movie several times and still feel the same sense of exhilaration, the same clearing of the air.
B009ZRY0IC|5.0|With the amount of music created every day in the society we live in, you would expect to find more masterfully pieced together albums. Ben Howard's album is nothing less than musical genius. He stands so far above the norm. His songs are soothing, energetic, and full of emotion! The kind of emotion that abandoned music back in the early to late 60s (though seen sparsely from artists such as Josh Garrels, Imogene Heap, Jack Johnson, Adele (to an extent), and a few others.) Just Youtube his songs listened a few times through each, and then once you've seen the light that Ben Howard's music is amazing, come back and buy the album. There are very few albums I would recommend on this level.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Overpriced as are most of your accessories, otherwise it is everything the product description stated. Outside strap is handy for holding wiping cloth.
B00168OIOE|5.0|This was a good buy.  Product arrived as shown.  Haven't retreived the digital copy yet, but getting that with the movie is great.
B00B7IJBUY|2.0|Really average music and lyrics!last three cds have been average and boring!! No fire and spirit left in the band! Live show is still awesome because of the older songs!<br />Mostly because of the older music is so much better and has balls!! Really the worst CD the band has done!!<br />Have been a fan since the first album and really after<br />Keep the faith the albums have been patchy!!Music has to move you ! Not bore you!!
0385349947|5.0|This book was so inspiring. I am passing it along to all my fellow female co-workers to inspire them! I wish there was a sequel...!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|The levels are challenging just enough to keep me coming back for more. I would recommend this to others. Fun to play.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Rebellious, politically sensitive for the times (not), radical and yet there is a message to be heard and pondered. Oh yeah, good music also :)
0545265355|5.0|My daughter asked for these for her birthday. She loved them and polished them off in less tha a week. By the way, my daughter is an adult, not a child. I don't know how appropiate they are for a teen or younger.
B00BY8DC2A|2.0|linear, endless songs, boring, non inspired compositions, Ndea in IN or OUT?..., what has happened?. I assume that the band has suffered problems in the recording of this cd. There is no other explanation...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't know who the heck is giving this book a bad rating and why!! Most reviews are coming from people who didn't even read it. How can you review a book without reading it!? Thats not right!! All you bandwagon haters clearly are wrong!!! I loved this book!!!  The ending yeah it sucked but it wasn't disappointing it sucked because it ended. If you're disappointed to get 2 more books then you never loved Gideon in the first place! To say its all about money, well of course it is. This is her career! Who works for free!?!?<br /><br />Back to the book! I loved that we finally are learning what drives Gideon and Eva. Their pasts are being explained and I loved the rawness it came with. The Brett/ Corinne story drove me a little nuts. But happily ever after isn't happening just yet!! Great job!! Can't wait for more! Just hope we don't have to wait forever again!!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Wow, that is literally all I can say after reading this book. It's heartfelt. Wow. It really changed my perspective on a lot of things.
1932735410|5.0|it is one of the good book I ever seen.<br />I like this book.<br />it is guiding you very nicely
B002WY65W4|4.0|Zombieland is one of those rare movies that remains uniquely memorable to watch. A zany tour de force of apocalyptic chaos, it's a movie worth many a watch for either a gory zombie fix or for great verbal jousts. Without further ado, get some Twinkies with Mountain Dew Code Red and enjoy!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I could not wait to FINALLY have ENTWINED WITH YOU .....to automatically be delivered to my kindle!!!!!!! I started to read this book and I was lost. I went to my bookcase and reread last couple chapters to refresh. I am all refreshed now........the continuance of the story was totally sucking me in. I get to the last chapter and think to myself that there is NO WAY this book could possibly end......with the way the story was going! BOY WAS I WRONG.......IT ENDED AND ENDED BADLY.....I TRULY HAVE NO DESIRE TO WAIT AROUND ANYMORE FOR THIS LOVE STORY! THEY ARE MARRIED .......END OF STORY! ENDING IT THAT WAY AND IT WOULD OF BEEN PERFECT. NOT GONNA LOOK FOR ANYMORE ON THE CROSSFIRE SERIES!!!!!  ~SIGNED TOTALLY BUMMED :(
0823023494|3.0|At least this book isn't another Christopher Hart book, but it is hard to tell the difference. It seems that all the Watson-Guptill books are starting to look alike, and have the same format? What's with that? Is there another book about animation character design that does it better? Probably not. Still, is this the best that can be done?
1400069289|5.0|Wow! More than 1000 reviews for this book on amazon!<br />I can agree - the book really deseves your attention!!<br /><br />Why?<br />1. Duhigg opens your eyes on what really drives our lives! Surprise! 40% of it is based on our customs<br />2. The Book tells about 20 simple but intereting stories, which proves the power of habit.<br />3. The book doesn't contain \\"how-to-kill-bad-habit\\" formula. It just attracts our attention to core human-lives mechanisms<br />4. I was fighting my bad-habits more than 10 years. To no purpose. I hope I will make some progress after this book. I'll try.<br /><br />No doubts - five stars!
0240810961|4.0|The main emphasis of this book is Gesture Drawing. This type of drawing is very useful for making hand-drawn animation. If you are interested in learning about gesture drawing, get this book, and the 2nd volume, as well. By the time you are finished with them, you will be thoroughly saturated in Gesture Drawing.
B00993I6D2|5.0|Filmed nearly 30 years ago, this gripping portrail of Orwell's dystopian prophecy (sadly) still rings true. Penned long before the advent of the digital age, Orwell foresaw that constant surveillance was the next logical step in a society bent on &#34;organizing&#34; every aspect of the lives of the productive class. Brilliantly cast, directed, and acted. Double-plus good!
B006LSZECO|2.0|A friend recommended the book, but it was not my kind of book.  I don't like getting into sick people's minds and didn't like the nasty language.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Love Bon Jovi and their new album!  Loved being able to get this as an immediate download and a CD.
0670026603|5.0|Just read the book from start to finish. Before you decide to read it, know that it is a very sad story interspersed with numerous humorous moments.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is an amazing app I love it. you have to earn every thing and protect it. the aurora does not. cost any thing you can earn that to. it is a fast paced game you don't sit for hours on end waiting for things to grow.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was awful. The story line was non existent and more than half the time the sex scenes were trashy. How many times can Eva say  \\"real good \\" during sex? Give me a break. This book was thrown out there to either meet a commitment or Sylvia Day wanted a new car. Horrible! The ending was absurd. So much for being a trilogy. Thanks to the people that gave instructions on how to get a refund because I did! And she really needs to stop with that awful nickname, Ace, for Gideon. This book sucked!
B00BZAJMWG|4.0|They were convincing.<br />Jennifer Lawrence was amazing. Bradley Cooper was right on and his mom was my most favorite of all.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I am a big fan of Lady A even before they hit it big. This album has some variations from their normal harmonies and melodies, but all in all is still very good. I have had some issues with the singles they chose from some of their past albums as I believe they could do better in that area. I have the same issue with this album. As an example, I think &#34;Nothin' Like The First Time&#34; is one of the best up tempo songs. Much better than &#34;Goodbye Town&#34; and &#34;Downtown&#34;.  Also, &#34;Golden&#34; is absolutely great.  Much better than &#34;I Did It All For Love&#34; as the best ballad. Other good bets for singles are: &#34;Better Off Now&#34;, and &#34;Long Teenage Goodbye&#34;. Other than that, I still love Lady A
B005BZQS1E|2.0|Sword and sorcery films are usually crap, and then along comes something which make crap seem not so bad.  Whoever grunted out the script for &#34;Your Highness&#34;...well, I hope they recover from whatever illness they had.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really, this is truly the most professionally written legal show.  Not just the writing but the acting is superb.  Each program keeps you spellbound.  I have so many favorite characters..it changes each week. Watch it NOW!!
B00000G3I2|5.0|Definitely lived this one. A true flashback for me. And the soundtrack is perfect. You couldn't ask for better tunes.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I returned this for a full refund.  I am so disappointed that as a TRILOGY that this was not the final book.  The story lines were all over the place and no resolutions.  I was frustrated that as this was a trilogy, now it's a 5 part book series.  \\"Done with you\\" Sylvia Day, I want my money back.
193700788X|3.0|It was okay, It helped me let go of the characters I grew to love. If you are looking for a OMG THIS IS AWESOME it's not this book.
B00BWDJILG|5.0|Excelent music by one of my prefered jazz musicians. I heard Joshua Redman speaking abou this CD in the New Orleans Jazz Festival. It was not available yet but I finally got the opportunity to listen to it.<br /><br />Excellent.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Book 3 picks up where book 2 left off! Gideon under suspicion for murder, trying to clear his name at the same time fighting to keep his relationship with Eva together. This is still as saucy & sexy as the first 2 books. They are still struggling to fight both their past demons. Looking forward to book 4
0199270295|5.0|Literary, it is the best organic chemistry book. It is comprehensive, clear and full of necessary information. It is worth the money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its and awesome great game but the only problem is very slow updates, i mean apple comes out like very fast. Amazon app store needs faster updates.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like to make list since it seems like if I turn my head, I forget what I was going to do!  So with the Note App, it helps me with grocery lists, to call things that I do want to junk up my brain with recalling.  It has helped tremendously.  A co-worker gave me a recipe and instead of printing a copy, I just jotted down the information.  In a snap I don't have to retrieve paper or try to remember....its great.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Sometimes it gets a tad confusing what tabs are what but honestly this if a fun game and its very realistic! Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a good game. Also it has a lot of detail.It doesn't have glitches.I doesn't take a long time to load at all.I love the people in the game and it has been really fun playing the game.My favorite part is when you get the mystery box. One time I got a save me key. I have all the people in the game.My favorite is Jake.My least favorite is the robot.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|First, no, this movie is not true to the book. But in many ways, it's a fresh, modern take on an old classic. This time, the time traveler actually has a mission and a real desire to change things. The soundtrack by Klaus Badelt really makes the story. Highly recommended!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read the bad reviews and I don't get it.  I love reading about Eva and Gideon and I could read their story forever.  I am excited about the next 2 books.  This book was AWESOME!  I also didn't get why everyone is disappointed in the ending.  In earlier interviews Sylvia Day did say there was a possibility that there were going to be more books in this series.  So to wrap it all up I LOVE THIS SERIES AND CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT 2 BOOKS!!!
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|Loved the quality.  Great remix.  Viva la Doors.  This is a keeper.  Grab a Blatz, throw this on and it's a little party at your place.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Keep up pace with the episode releases. I know this would be difficult contract to manage but even if the episodes were delayed a couple of weeks it would have little impact to HBO but would sell well.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|IT's addicting! Enthralling, twisting, conniving, and the wits are as sharp as the swords. I love the dialogue as much as the storyline. The casting is absolutely superb for ever character. I couldn't imagine it going any other way. There is a LOT of nudity and sex and it is &#34;rape-y&#34;, but I suppose for the time that this is all taking place, it's (not perfectly but) pretty accurate. I love the strong female characters and men that are more dramatic that most of the females. You pick your favorites pretty quickly. The whole series is great, keep them coming!
B00D41H2PS|4.0|This game was different from most adventure games but was pretty good overall. No hidden object scenes for one. You basically have to find different objects and tools to continue through any part of the game. I figured out most of them only getting really stuck two times. On the menu screen you can find a walkthrough by touching the Facebook button and clicking on the YouTube video on the Facebook page. The game was quite short but didn't cost much so I can't really complain. If you enjoy the print and click adventure games this is with playing but nothing to rave about.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was kind of disappointed in the story line of this book. I thought that adding new characters was a good step but I had different ideas that would have been more interesting. I am waiting for the fourth book to come out, hopefully it will be worth the money this time.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|As a huge Mercury fan, I was ecstatic when I found out that the Barcelona album had been remastered - not only remastered, re-recorded. For the remastered album, all songs were scored for a full orchestra. Many instruments from the original album were actually synthesizers (such as the koto in \\"La Japonaise\\"). The quality of both Mercury and Montserrat's voices are crystal clear and maintain both the passion and feel of the original album, but this album has minor, tasteful additions that come with a full orchestra. Even the unseasoned listener will appreciate the incredible quality of full orchestra accompaniment paired with these two powerhouse vocalists. I recommend looking up the video on You Tube that elaborates on the amount of detail that went in to remastering this album. This remastered album also includes a couple songs not found on the original Barcelona album: \\"Exercises in Free Love\\" (This is sung by Mercury in stunning falsetto and is what Mercury gave Montserrat when they first met.)  and \\"How Can I Go On\\" feat. violinist David Garret.<br /><br />Mercury sought to marry his two passions of rock and opera into this album. I'm so pleased to see Mercury's vision come full circle with this remastered album. I do believe he would have approved.<br /><br />And yes, the first time I listened to this album, I cried.
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|We loved this movie.  Brad Pitt was awesome in it as he comedically goes and kills and scalps Nazis.  A must have for any movie lover.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|After reading the Hit that I enjoyed tremendously I read that The Innocent was written before the Hit an I wanted to see if it was as good and it was I read it in a day and a half
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is definitely one of Tarantino's best movies, if not his best.  We saw it at the theatre and purchase 2 copies, one for us and one for our daughter. A must have in your movie collection.  A must see if you love to see the underdog triumph over his oppressors.
B009R659L8|5.0|It had been many years since I've read one of her books I really enjoyed it will definitely read more of her and recommend her
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Perfect book to collect, if you are Jane Austine fan.  And it is pretty neat to have an audio option to listen to.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|David Gilmour in the Royal Albert Hall, what a combination. Great sound and artists, a felt a little embarrassed for Crosby and Nash, billed as vocalists on a number of tracks but essentially just providing harmonies to DG.<br />I liked David Bowie's spin on the Arnold Lane track and of course the mandatory Comfortably Numb, I think I have a dozen or so versions of this song now; all good!<br />This DVD is a must for any PF collection and something that can be watched over again and again without getting tired of it.<br />I think the DVD, David Gilmour at Robert Wyatts Meltdown has a more interesting presentation with a bias toward acoustic and the feature cello adding a new dimension to the original PF arrangements. Love it.
B008476HBM|5.0|Perfect book to collect, if you are Jane Austine fan.  And it is pretty neat to have an audio option to listen to.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season two is yet another season in this great show that will have you begging for more. Great writing and superb acting.

B0085YOD1A|5.0|My idea was to buy buy it to help me with my battery and it gave me so much more knowledge than I expected it to.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|She loved everything in this package; it was a lot of fun for her to open and reminisce times from her childhood.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love  this game cannot set it down since I've downloaded it!!!!!!!!!when you download it you will be so happy!!!!!I love  this game!!!!
B00BEXB18M|2.0|Sounds like Cinderella meets Motley Crue. If you think I am being harsh just listen to the banjo on the song \\"The Blackest Crow\\" oh and there is slide guitar as well. The banjo intro -nice, the combo with distortion guitar -not nice.I like 80's rock but I don't buy MEGADETH to hear 80's rock. Kingmaker may be the only good song in the deck. I would call Endgame \\"Rust in Peace part 2\\" and I would call Super Collider \\"Risk part 2.\\" Where are the spectacular guitar solos? Where are the speedy riffs? There are about 3 good songs on this album; Kingmaker, Don't turn your back, and Burn. If you want to bang your head get the latest Soulfly album \\"Enslaved\\" it is good and heavy. \M/
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining and this game makes you focus and concentrate your mind into a mental exercise and keeps you alert.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|They remain true to their sound, no experimental non-sense. It is better than the last album in my opinion. I did not like the sound bites on Amazon, but I heard an HQ down-load of the entire album on another site and knew I had to have it. So I came back to Amazon and down-loaded it. With the sound consistency I can not imagine any true fan not enjoying this album.
B0091XT8F0|5.0|BEST MOVIE EVER!  made my kids watch it for the first time and they all laughed several times.  A True classic!
B006YTYIXG|5.0|Better than the last album and I though the last album was the best they ever put out. The hooks are not as catchy in this album, however, the benefit is that you don't get tired of hearing the album quickly. This is one of the greatest metal albums ever, prepare to thrash! I can not give \\"Enslaved\\" enough praise! I down-loaded this after Megadeth \\"Super Collider\\". \\"Enslaved\\" undid the damage done to me after \\"Super Collider ripped my spirit out \\"Enslaved\\" patch-worked me back to life.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|I love Madeleine Peyroux and this is another great CD with a great choice of songs. It came quickly and in good condition.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|It is a great musical! There were some errors within the French lyrics that were in the book, but other than that, it is most definitely a great time!
B0000025RI|2.0|It stopped playing and I thought it was defective. Then I realized it.only a few songs. Was expecting more numbers.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I am starting to wish that I would have bought this app through Google play because I am still waiting on the v0.7.1 update. I am very disappointed with how much slower it is to get updates through amazon. Galaxy player 3.6 here is still waiting.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I loved the story although at times it was difficult to follow because of all of the extraordinary detail. I may read it again because of all the attention to detail that were given by the author.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was recommended because I enjoyed reading The Game of Thrones and wanted something new to read after being done that series.  I recall being told that after 3 chapters, the person was hooked.  I don't know that I was hooked that quickly - but I do remember somewhere a third into the book not being able to put it down.  I am reading through this series so quickly I am already almost done the second book and yet I only just purchased these about a week ago.  I recommend them.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was very interesting and had a good story line.  However, I think it could have been written in just one book if all the sex scenes were omitted.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|Although it is not a Polaroid original film, it's very good to have a film available. You have to wait around 45 minutes to the photo complete development, and it is quite disapointing. I had to use a whole film to get used to it and know how to calibrate, but now I'm getting some nice pictures.
B002BBJ52U|3.0|Not as clever as I wanted it to be, and a lot of the people seem a lot more desperate than what I'd like to see.  Cute and fun for a quick watch, but nothing I'd re-watch.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Having read the previous 2 books in this series, I highly anticipated this one.  I found it repetitive and pointless.  Very little was resolved in the story and, it was left as a cliffhanger.  I will read the next book simply because I'm this far into the series but I will not recommend it to my friends.
B002WN35DC|5.0|Is an excelent book, specially to psychology students.  I'll recommend for every one to love read.  Also is a good book for kids.
0800141660|5.0|This is one of our all-time favorite movies.  Emma Thompson's screenplay was much better than the one by Andrew Davies, IMHO. Her portrayal of Elinor is excellent as are the portrayals of the other main characters! We watch this version over and over again and never tire of it.<br /><br />The Andrew Davies screenplay is good, but there are insertions into the story of meaningless salacious bits and the portrayal of Willoughby and Brandon pale in comparison to the above movie. We have watched this one a couple of times, but that's it.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Since \\"Fury Road\\" (the fourth Mad Max film) is up for release next year, this three-disc collection serves up the first \\"trilogy\\" of Mad Max films from 1978-1985 to attract new fans.  Two of the three movies (\\"Mad Max\\" and \\"The Road Warrior\\", aka \\"Mad Max 2\\") have been released on Blu-ray already, and the content of those two discs remains mostly the same.  In fact, \\"Mad Max\\" is basically the same disc with new artwork, but \\"The Road Warrior\\" features slightly better video quality (due to a new encoding) and a terrific new lossless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track.  The bonus features on both discs are identical.<br /><br />The third film, \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\", is new to Blu-ray and debuts as part of this collection.  Sadly, the only extra is the film's trailer (older releases, including the DVD, were the same way), but at least the A/V quality is quite good.  Other than that, this three-disc collection is packaged in a nice metal tin and looks cool.<br /><br />If you already own the first two films on Blu-ray, this might be tough to recommended.  I didn't, so it was worth the price of admission.  All three films hold up pretty well, especially due to the great A/V presentation that a quality Blu-ray treatment can provide.
B000FQIRXQ|3.0|I read the book and really liked it, but it was long, since there were so many subplots and so much to like and dislike. Dickens is a master storyteller. I really liked the cast in this movie, but there was so much in the book that was left out. I wouldn't have minded a little less of the cruelty from David's step-father, but I guess it was important.  Maggie Smith was awesome as was Daniel Radcliffe. The older David was just OK and the wicked law clerk was played superbly enough for me to detest him. Ham was a bit light in the movie as was his relationship. My wife, having not read the book, doesn't want to see it again.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|Towards the end I kind of lost the point of the story. Great characters, disappointing towards the end. Also I didn't understand the overly religious part of it.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|This version moves a bit slowly and I did not like the portrayal of Mr. Knightly, Mr. Woodhouse, nor Jane Fairfax and Mr.Weston's son nearly as well as the other movie. Mr. Elton and his bride in this movie are better than in the other movie, as is the portrayal of Harriet Smith. Overall, I won't watch this nearly as much as the Kate Beckinsale version.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|It's very realistic to portrait a person who is gay and single and 30ish and overworked. I really like it. Highly recommended!!
B001GMQALY|5.0|Great! Just what I needed for a gift!  Yes it was....if you want intense...here it is!  Yes Intense!  Love it!
044024613X|5.0|A gripping, fascinating read about the long running nature v. nurture debate about what drives human behavior.  A must read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game it challenges your eye hand coordination. My grandkids love it. There's always a fight over who gets to play it first
B00A1C16HS|4.0|I have not read the original set of four novels by Ford Madox Ford upon which this series was based - I understand that much of one of those novels was excised from the screenplay here.  Ordinarily, I am disappointed by novel-screen transfers, so perhaps not having read the original material has enhanced my admiration of this series, which is literate, beautifully produced, and superbly acted.<br /><br />The painful story of Christopher Tietjens, a product of Britain's late 19th century-early 20th century class system, focuses on Tietjens's moral and emotional struggles as World War I engulfs Europe.  Tietjens is a deeply conservative man employed as a mathematician by the government, producing statistical analyses for it.  We learn early that he has been entrapped into marriage with a beautiful but calculating socialite named Sylvia, due to an out of wedlock pregnancy that we (and he) are never certain is his doing.  Tietjens's struggles to achieve balance between his natural reserve and values (the 18th century against the 19th, the country against the city, as he defiantly puts it), amid events that overtake his personal life and his life as a citizen of a country at war, are demonstrated with great delicacy by Benedict Cumberbatch.  Cumberbatch offers a beautifully paced, nuanced portrait of an emotionally constricted man pushed nearly beyond endurance by the imperatives imposed on him by a world war and an unhappy marriage. Ford Madox Ford intended this to be an anti-war novel, but even not having read the tetralogy, it seemed as if the writers chose to emphasize the love triangle that develops among Tietjens, the wife who marries him for social convenience, and the young suffragette with whom he falls in love, and to refract the horrors of the war through these relationships, rather than the other way around. Complicating matters for Tietjens is his love for the son Sylvia bears after their marriage, and whose real paternity he quickly ceases to care about, bonding with the child and doing his best to be a responsible and loving father.<br /><br />There are a great many strands to this story, which covers a period beginning before and ending shortly after World War I.  Cumberbatch's performance is subtle and moving.  He conveys Tietjens' deeply rooted ideas about honor, almost a confused sense of having been born in the wrong place at the wrong time, and his titanic efforts to free himself sufficiently to respond to love and warmth. Given the nearly Asperger-like reserve that shackles so much of Tietjens's persona, those struggles are wrenching to witness. Rebecca Hall turns in a marvelous performance as the spiteful, emotionally warped Sylvia.  The DVD is worth purchasing just for these two performances, although the rest of the cast is hardly far behind.<br /><br />I plan to read Ford's tetralogy as soon as I can, but, as it is, this series and its portrayals continue to linger in memory.  Note: this is a Region 2 DVD, so you will need to have, as I do, a region-free DVD player to watch it.
B00AK57N00|2.0|Can't play but a min at a time. It force closes every time so it had to go. Chou. Sish
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Amazing animation.  Nice story, but best for effects.  Can't say it lived up to the expectation from all the hype.  But it certainly deserved the animation huzzahs.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|That's a great game.What's the one after Miami.ok great.I loved it.Why is it called subway surfers?It was fun playing it.Have a good day.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Worth watching from the beginning .... when it got to the finale, I was disappointed there wasn't more.  Season 2 not so much ... the whiney little boy artist shoulda got kicked to the curb after his first tantrum.
B004C03L4G|5.0|A magnificent way to begin every day.  Doreen Virtue offers peace and perspective which helps guide you to open your heart and mind to welcome the love and peace that is already there waiting for you.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome game but... I wish it had the nether, the end, and a unlimited world. I hate how you are in a small little box.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|My mother treasures in her memory going to the cinema with her own father to see Audrey Hepburn's films, when she was young. She was also an admirer of Ms Hepburn's acting skills and style. I gave her this DVD as a present for her birthday last year, and she couldn't believe how I got it. Absolutely worth having if you love classic Hollywood films..
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|It seems like Dexter is spreading himself a little too thin. Too many people are finding out about what he is, I can see the end coming soon. I guess that's why there is only one season left.<br />Still though, I wonder how next season will end.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is yet another hit in the Cut the Rope series. Ever since I first played the Original Cut the Rope at a Best Buy store,  I took a liking to the adorable little monster many know as Om Nom. I also await the many new levels that shall soon come to Cut the Rope: Time Travel. I await last, but not least, the many other hits in the Cut the Rope series that shall come to us in the upcoming future.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|My intention was to take documents created on my laptop and download them to my kindle. Then using Office Suite Pro I could edit the documents. I don't think this is possible or if it is I can't figure out how to do it. Without this feature Office Suite Pro serves no purpose.<br />In addition the small screen and keyboard make any serious attempt at documentation troublesome. It just isn't as efficienct as a larger keyboard on a laptop or PC. While tweaking and editing of a document created on a larger computer would be helpful, creation of those documents on a kindle size platform is problematic. I wouldn't mind this program on my PC but it doesn't work on a pad.
1476734941|4.0|This book is an easy read. I had been hearing interviews on the radio and I'm glad I got the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I give it 6 stars if possible because this is simply the best horror soap ever created. I reminds me of being a kid and watching movies and I would have to turn away from the gore. This makes me do the same thing and the show has even made me shed tears from their turmoil.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who like horror movies cause the thrills just keep coming
B00D2K40WY|5.0|DONT GIVE OUT THAT INFO I CANT BELIEVE U DID THAT I LOVE IT TO BUT THERE COULD BE BAD GUYS ON HERE SO NO PERSONAL INFO PEOPLE! OMG WOW.  :(
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This movie is great... great story great acting... Still love it after all these years. Cant believe it took me so long to order it!
1576875776|5.0|This is an excellent edition of some magnificient pictures from such an enigmatic artist. I love it! Don't expect comments on the pictures or anything. They are just very nicely printed for you to enjoy all the details and let your imagination flow.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|this game is fun and some what challenging.  the big downfall is its short.  also changing screens can be slow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very well written. A love story with an intriguing twist. Once you start it, you won't want to put it down!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is so unique....very myst like. The graphics are very high quality, the story was mysterious and I still never got any answers! There is a lot of room to expand and I will be purchasing all new chapters that come out. I played a bit here and there and beat it in just a few days...it is very engrossing. This is one of the best games I've played.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This another one of those movies that you can watch often and not get tired of it. The cast is perfect. Some may be disturbed by a scene or two, but I found it to be very enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a fun game for the whole family. My kids love it and I have to admit it's pretty addictive and hard to put down...
B000GWE44U|5.0|What's not to love about this movie? Even though I've seen this a hundred times, I don't get tired of it. I could watch again and again. Jack NIcholson at his best. If you're a horror / suspense movie fan, you can't go wrong with this.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I am addicted to it. I am waiting for you to release Season 702 on Prime. This is a Great BBC Show.
B004TPJMLA|5.0|Because Simon has covered more of the prism in World Music than most anybody in rock, this record is more tangentially than overtly related to \\"Graceland\\". In a step up, he's now immersed with the linking of West African and Brazilian polyrhythms. So much in fact that his vocal presence isn't even the dominant instrument despite all his fascinating socio-political imagery. In a music-first album, these exotic rhythms are unique and refreshing to the ear. I can never get enough of the big beat on \\"The Obvious Child\\" nor the warm and dreamy ambience of Vincent Nguini's guitar passagework on \\"The Coast\\" and the tracks afterward that bear his name. Just like before, the backup singers are a tremendous asset in complementing Simon's quietly pleasing voice. As for Simon, he continues to have that knack in stretching his music and, with this superb collective of musicians, somehow have it completely pegged to rock & roll. And him getting away with that puts a smile to my face every time.
0345529057|5.0|these books are amazing don't know who wouldn't like this series.my grandmotger ordered the series and I'm only eleven.I love to read adult books,tean books, and books tgat are 11 and up
B009KG7EMC|4.0|THE 1ST MOVIE WAS GREAT, MOST SEQUEL'S DON'T STACK UP TO THE 1ST MOVIE. THIS 1 IS VERY CLOSE. HARD TO BEAT ACTION PACKED, FULL OF BIG NAME STARS, WITH A STORY LINE AS REAL AS WATCHING THE NEWS. THIS MOVIE IS A MUST IF YOU LIKE ACTION MOVIES.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really liked this book because it had a great amount of action,drama,and comedy to make a great book. My favourite part of this book has to be when Percy fell out of the St.Louis Arch Its a local monument to I loved how they included it in the book.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|works great with the Kindle. compact and nice looking. Definitely worth it when you buy the Kindle!! I recommend it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.I play other bingo games, but this by far the best one. I would suggest anyone who's looking for some fun to check this out!
B00D41H2PS|3.0|This game started out slowly because there were no directions and I was essentially wandering around blindly until things finally started to click. It took a few tries and leaving the game before trying again another day.  After the initial slow start it became fun as I figured things out. However, once I figured things out, I was done with the game in about 20 minutes. A bit of a disappointment since it took me so long in  the beginning.  The little bit I played was fun, but not enough time to really be able to give a hearty recommendation.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Amazing graphics. And so many different areas to explore. Definitely worth downloading. Hope you enjoy playing it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This is a fun show, that is clever and witty, some of the situations can be a little silly, but it is the best legal dramedy I have seen since Boston Legal!
0786962984|5.0|Dungeon is an accessible game that is fun for younger players, but introduces some of the concepts of role-playing fantasy games, and adventure and exploration.  I played it back in the late 70s/early 80s and was glad to introduce it to my kids.  They liked it.
B00170MYIS|5.0|This battery solved all my camera problems. I found out that using the same battery as the camera came with, will help you avoid problems that seem to be with the camera. My other replacement battery did not have enough energy to power the camera.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't understand how I can possibly enjoy reading about the daily lives of two codependent people who are so messed up.  And how come everybody in this book is super gorgeous? Even from Bared to You, it has all the recipes of a bad book.<br /><br />Obsessive Codependent relationship - Check<br />Everyone is so gorgeous it hurts - Check<br />(Most) Everyone is rich - Check<br /><br />But damn I can read about them forever.  I mean this series only spans weeks so it doesn't leap over a big span of time so that means you are reading their hourly and daily lives and I FREAKIN' LOVE IT. It's written so obsessively.  You can't help but feel their love and root for them.  In the back of your mind you think you know that it's unhealthy for Gideon and Eva to be the way they are with each other then add in their horrible past of abuse, their high profile life, and all their surrounding like their exes, her parents, Cary, even her coworkers and it is daunting but Sylvia Day writes it superbly so that you feel a part of it, you root for it, you love it.<br /><br />I love how solid Gideon and Eva are as a couple by the end of this book.  It ends with them being in a solid place.  Things aren't always good but their relationship is firm.  They give as good as they they take from each other. Eva is strong where she needs to be and Gideon is domineering where he needs to be and somehow they balance each other well. They've worked hard to be together and you feel all that hard work and you want them to reap the benefits of it. I bow down to Sylvia Day for not making the ending a cliffhanger just for the sake of it.  You want to read the next book because you are emotionally invested in these characters and you want to see their growth as a couple.  Also what surprised me is all the secondary characters like Cary (I wish he would get his head straight so he can be with Trey), and what the heck is up with Megumi???<br /><br />I am definitely looking forward to more. There are so many loose ends to tie up. There's still more issues to deal with from their past but I am excited and look forward to seeing them tackle all those together! Ms. Day leaves you feeling good about their relationship and doesn't leave you hanging.  It ends in a really good place.<br /><br /> OH yeah, did I mention that there's some serious hotness in this book???? The passion and the chemistry burns in the pages...
B0082RX1P4|5.0|Contains both business and life axioms. Couldn't put it down. I'd recommend to all my business associates; in fact, I purchased a copy as a gift for an associate already.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My kindle doesn't have 7.0 yet! My friend has it on her iPod and I love the spawn eggs!please update otherwise it is a fun game
B0050DIWFC|4.0|First things first. I think We Need to Talk About Kevin is a very similar book and it's the better written of the two because it feels more real and you get a better picture of the son's personality. That being said, Defending Jacob is a solid story that kept my interest. It seemed a bit unrealistic that the father would be working on the case at first and I felt like the son was hard to get to know. Nonetheless, this is a good book that makes you wonder what you would do in a similar situation (God forbid).
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was fast paced, original, and actually told a good story from beginning to end. This is very refreshing for me as I just came off go the Game of Thrones books which never seem to complete anything. This book was more interesting and much better paced. A real pleasure. I am so glad to have found a new quality series to read.
B00BESM14U|5.0|It is a great movie and the story touched me.  I really got 'into' the movie and reccommend it to anyone with an open mind.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My son cannot get enough of this app. He plays it every chance he gets and has even taught his lil sister how to play. It's a great game that I do not mind him playing.

B00AB55BS0|5.0|Obviously the series is great in acting/writing quality, but the Blu-Ray quality is nice. The extra Digital Copies and DVDs mean it can go with me in the automobile DVD or off the tablet device. Very nice.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's a great game very additive the only problem I have is I need the game to upgrade on my Kindle fire other than that I would've gave it 5 stars
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just as another person mention it has the flavor of Myst but solvable if your patient. I will most certainly purchase the sequel when it appears.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Enjoy it thoroughly has helped me tremendously. Well suggest to all my friends this is why I chose kindle to begin with!!!!!

B0063IH60K|2.0|The cards are sharp, easy to read. Many options to change colors and styles. After a few weeks of playing regularly , weird, unknown music will sporadically play for about 10 seconds. There is a flash of background light right before it happens. This is not an ad nor is it any music i have on my kindle.  Amazon has been unable to figure it out even after hearing the music.  I also have freecell with this company with the same issues! I do enjoy playing their games otherwise. This music doesn't play any other time. Has anyone else had this issue?
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Really nice to have this available for my Kindle Fire HD. I wish it was available for my Windows Phone platform.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Great tunes on this CD, I'd recommend it if you like Bruno Mars.<br />I play this CD all the time.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|solid app. no bugs. does what its supposed to do. also very intuitive. I am happy to give it five stars.
160774273X|5.0|My resolution for my 31st birthday was to learn how to bake bread. I read Ken's book (which was actually fun to read not just recipes but a true artist's passionate account of bread making). I got all of the tools that Ken recommended and have been baking bread successfully ever since. I'm so pleased. Thank you Ken for writing such a fantastic book!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Has the potential to be an amazing game, but there are just too many problems.  It would cost hundreds of dollars (or literally take years) to acquire everything in this \\"free to play\\" app. I can understand charging for some things, but basic items required to complete the main quest in the game takes this out of the free to play area imo.  Add to that the infrequent Kindle updates, often months behind other platforms and skipping entire blocks of content along with a barely functioning social aspect that is also required to get some content, and you end up with a game with too many problems to recommend.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Very good story and I love the writer's style AND I really love the Jack Reacher character.<br />I am going to purchase the next book in the series right now !!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book and can't wait to hear more! I love how the passion between Eva and Gideon is still so amazing and the love for each other has grown into an amazing love story.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I found the downloading to be easy and quick.  This comes in handy when you are a teacher and need a copy.  The students loved the movie and were able to make all of the connection s that were taught in the US History class.
0316069434|5.0|I have read all of Connelly's full length novels and this is my third favorite, surpassed only by Bloodwork and Black Echo. I follow his characters as faithfully as I do John Lutz's Nudger, Quinn, and Carver. Both authors specialize in somewhat scarred Detectives. Connelly adds Lawyers and FBI agents (albeit less violent than Lee Child's ex-cop Reacher). Here we have Bosch in rare form. Asked by his nemesis to investigate, he sets the world on fire by what he finds. There are no bridges he doesn't burn, no friendship he doesn't sacrifice, he is the Spartacus of Crime Novelists. From beginning to end I was entranced by this gripping tale and anxiously await his next installment. Harry Bosch for the new head of the FBI!....shu
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is definitely 5 stars. I think it's better then the regular Facebook app. Even though you got go keep zooming into it. Kind of annoying. But I can deal with it. It works good on my kindle Fire HD. I get the notification too. This app is great for free :D<br />Thank you!
B004LZFWJO|5.0|cant. put it down!  this is the kind. of game. I like to play. I give 5 stars. I can go really fast if I use a stylas.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is so fun I can text my friends even though I don't have a phone I love this app it is so awesome.
B0013O123Q|1.0|this movie was very disturbing and slow and I wouldn't recommend it. I guess if you like rape scenes and subtitles go for it.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I've only beat this thing 3 times. Love this game. My son (22) and I sit for hours trying to stump this thing and usually, Akinator gets it right! Hours of fun and frustration...in a good way!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If I could give it 50 stars I would.  This is the most magnificent series that has been available in a very long time.  From the clothing to the scenery to the wonderful actors and actresses, it is stellar.I can't wait to purchase season #3.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It really brought domestic abuse to the forefront.  It also showed that you can make a new start and that there are a lot of good people in this world.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am loving this series of books and I can't wait for the continuing story. I highly recommend this series of books to readers.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love being able to access an accurate forecast at my fingertips.  It's pretty much spot on, so I am sold on it..
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This is a must have item if you have a kindle. It was strong enough to protect my kindle and flexible enough to stand the kindle or to use it in any direction. I loved the color selection and the texture it felt durable and smooth with a sense of fashion.
0385344325|5.0|I'm a big fan of Jack Reacher novels and this one certainly did not disappoint.  It is one of the earlier books in the series.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love the first season of Doctor Who. I must watch for any Doctor Who fan. You will fall in love with The Doctor and Rose
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King has done it again.  This is a quick read and I enjoyed it as I have nearly all of his books.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game but it won't let me upgrade I mean even my sister got the upgrade on her iPod and iPhone did any of you guys know there was no upgrade?
B00915G6WQ|4.0|If you are a lover of this series, you will appreciate the complexity of Dexter's situation this season. Though any season fails to compare to the Trinity season, season seven new characters were still delightful to watch.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|I still have this on VHS that I purchased in 1990. I've waited a while since dvd's came out like everyone else..<br />The bonus footage is very nice to have because I always wondered how they ended that show. The first time I watched this I was amazed of the production scale and every time since it feels like Christmas morning.<br />True Maiden fans will understand the importance of this dvd.This was Maiden at their best!
B00C1C188I|4.0|This remake isn't a groundbreaking revamp of Carpenter's 1982 classic, but it succeeds in providing a clever new layer to the original story while still delivering the tense, paranoia-drenched atmosphere of Carpenter's version.  The CGI is a bit of a mess, but the capable cast and steady pacing more than make up for it.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Back in what? Forget that Black album, every song on this album is a 10. I purchased this back in 1990 on cassette. I had Back in Black on 8 track from 1980 and must say that Razor's Edge made their career.
B00005QB42|5.0|The voice of Deva Premal is so clear and soothing it reaches your inner self and touches your outer self to bring it back into focus and gives your clarity back.  It is also grand to listen to when you are already full of joy and peace.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Counting down the days till the next book...so entranced in the Gideon and Eva love affair....fabulous book,couldn't  put it down!
B0095P33IW|4.0|Good action good actors, liked it better than Thor. Thought it was a good origins movie and the Red Skull was pretty solid.
B00CW665VI|3.0|Tangled was a breath of fresh air. The main character who is finally a guy with a broken heart is awesome. You know he is a jerk, but end up rooting for him in the end. Tangled is a good book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great. It's very easy to play. Much more fun when you get to the different levels/worlds. Only thing i don'[t like is that it uses a lot of battery. But otherwise worth it. Best of all it's a FREE APP :)
B0053O89XI|5.0|Considering that the purchase cost is roughly 1.99 per episode on VuDu (We use a ROKU box for our primary entertainment source) the purchase price made this a sweeter deal.  We got Blu-Ray, DVD, and Ultraviolet for the cost of Ultraviolet alone...  Maybe even a little cheaper.  Besides the great deal, as always the show is awesome!!  So awaiting season 7 to start!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I chose this product on the recommendation of my 21 year old stepdaughter, and I'm not sorry. Even for a (slightly) &#34;tech challenged&#34; more senior citizen like myself it was/is a pleasure to use and does the job well.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Fast paced, enough action and twist to plot to keep you interested. If you are a Baldacci fan, you need to read this one.
B0000256VK|5.0|Saw Roxy Music's first gig in the UK as a young lad and thought they were great from the start. Someone &#34;borrowed&#34; my album sometime ago so I was glad to replace it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Was expecting more of a plot type book, following through &#34;the war&#34; but the interview style recollection of events was pretty neat. Recommend to anyone who is a zombie fan
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I cant stop playing. Its like a video game drug addiction. My favorite ap.<br /> Cant wait for the next sequel to come out.
0374214913|5.0|I just re-read Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Book Store, something I rarely do but one of my book groups selected it and it had been a while since I had read it. I was amazed to find how much I enjoyed reading it again. The folks in my book group who were older couldn't get into it but I think they just shut down at the first sign of technology. I am fairly \\"mature\\" myself,but found the book delightful. You don't have to be a super teckie to enjoy it. We are smack dab in the process of transitioning more and  more functions to technology and print media is foremost among those functions. The resistance by some to technology makes me think of how people must have resisted machines during the industrial revolution.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's is not only an enjoyable and interesting read, it brings up the issues of mortality/immortality, the significance of our lives, what is most important, solving mysteries and challenges, etc. And, of course, the importance of feeling like we are doing something meaningful. Another major issue is our resistance to change.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all ages .. and if you are an older person, stretch a little bit for chrissakes. The book really shows how people of diverse ages can learn to appreciate and support each other, and how both young and old have something to learn from each other.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Overall I enjoyed the movie but it was not a &#34;great film&#34; by any stretch. My younger (11-12) loved it, but older teen was entertained.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played! I can not wait for the next one. This is fantastic! Beautiful graphics everything is just perfect
B0061QD88S|5.0|Lady and the Tramp in an old classic that I wanted to see again and being on dvd helped. I would recommend this family movie to any and everyone.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is awesome love this game awake she put because he's had a good book that he is reading his name is hudson
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled is an entertaining movie for everyone and I just loved it. I wanted it for my collection of excellent movies. I would heartily recommend this movie for everyone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Incredible book. It starts out slow and very confusing. However as you keep reading you notice that this story has a lot more than a typical WW2 book about a girl living in Germany. As you read your perspective of the war changes instead of seeing the Germans as the has guys you notice that this was are devastating for everyone and that in reality the enemies aren't the Germans or the communists but the humans ourselves.  In the last page of this book the man mentions that humans are the worst of all, plus this really has an emotional effect on you because through the story you have seen everything from Leslie point of view so you become emotionally attached to her.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|This is one of my top favorite drama/suspense show I've ever seen. The plot twists and turns keep you guessing.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|When I finished \\"City of bones\\" ( the first book), I was a little disappointed, because I thought it would be a lot better, but still enjoyed it , don't get me wrong. So I knew I had to give the second book a chance, and thank goodness I did!!!! This book was amazing , I just got more and more connected to the characters and felt how they felt.<br />I really love and enjoyed Cassandra Clair's writing style.<br />This is a great series. If your like me and didn't \\"love\\" the first book, please please please give the second book a chance, you won't regret it, at least I didn't! And I'm super exited to start reading the next book!!!!!! :)
034580404X|1.0|So I finally decided to give these books a shot, almost a year after all the hype. I didn't read any of the reviews, just went ahead and bought them.<br />I usually like everything I read, even light readings I find entertaining, but these are just RIDICULOUS. I had to stop reading, and come read what others had to say, and write my own review.<br />1. The repetitions: If I ever read again the following: \\"Inner goddess, subconscious, jeez, foil packet,lips twitching, my 50 shades\\" among many others, I might vomit. The same words and adjectives are used every 2 pages. It's really annoying.<br />2. The story: The \\"plot\\" is so retarded, unbelievable, so unrealistic, seems written by a 14 year old. Don't even get me started on the characters!! As so many people put it, it's twilight with sex. The guy is a posessive, jealous, jerk, but everything he does is alright because he's so beautiful (We are reminded that he's beautiful every 1 1/5 pages). She's scared of him all the time, but it's ok, she still marries him because he's too hot, and they have sex, they fight, they are insecure, and they have sex again. Oh and for her, being rich is such a drag...yeah right?!<br />3. The sex \\"scenes\\" are so boring and repetitive. No much BDSM happening, they have sex like 10 times a day, and every single time she's able to have an orgasm off course. The tampon scene was so disgusting as well, nobody does that, seriously.<br /><br />4. The way they talk: who refers to their husband/wife as \\"Mr Grey/Mrs Grey/Mrs Steel\\" ALL THE DAMN TIME?? Who does that? It was really obnoxious.<br />5. Why they want to try to justify the fact that someone likes BDSM because they are traumatized by their childhood? Why put this lifestyle as something bad, that you would only do if you are troubled? I do not think that is accurate at all, and I really doubt that the BDSM community would be thrilled about that. I couldn't enjoy, or get aroused at all knowing that the main character was abused. Completeturn off.<br />I could go on and on forever, and I can't believe I read books 1 and 2 entirely. I started reading the first 3 chapters of the 3rd book, but I cannot do it anymore. I do not care how it ends or what happens to Mr and Mrs Grey...I just hope they die.
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|I was entertained but at many points during the movie I thought it didn't make legitimate sense.  Granted I should have know that being a zombie movie.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love it Love it Love it !! Cant wait to start season 2 ! I watched the entire season 1 in 1 day !
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|I've seen all the PA movies and this had absolutely nothing new to offer.  All the same scary effects each movie has done before and the story line was boring.  By far the worst of the series.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|watched the whole thing waiting for it to make some sense.  it never did.  Just an awful experience for me.  Felt like a waste of time , really.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I like this book, or part of book. I found some interesting infomation. Neverteless the book is a part of another bigger and I had to buy the another,
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fast paced, beautiful colors, would recommend to anyone.  Makes you think quickly.  Would possibly change the music from time to time.
B0087IT8FK|2.0|Once in a while a movie comes along... that makes me feel blind.<br /><br />This beautifully shot movie is not without great acting and charm. Driss (Omar Sy) is pure charisma and Philippe (Francois Cluzet)'s performance is, while too understated, nuanced. Some scenes were really well-done. I'll look for other films with these amazing actors.<br /><br />Beyond this, however, I just can't see what others see in this movie. It is a heart-warming story, sorta, but so many movies have been here before; this is the Bucket List and the Odd Couple mixed in with five made-for-TV movies about a challenged person who needs a bit of sass in their life, provided by an uncouth companion. Driss' bullies his way through the movie and everyone just finds it endearing.  There he is assaulting the neighbor. There he is manhandling and humiliating the boss' daughter's boyfriend. Why? Well, because. Oh, Driss. Is he pouring hot water on Philippe's legs because he can't feel a thing? It's OK because it's amusing to him. By the way, is Philippe's daughter acting like a brat and doing drugs? No problem, Driss is offering to smack her a few times, and well, Philippe won't mind, she has it coming. And the caring nice guy nurse who takes over after Driss? Oh, no patience for that caring jerk. I seriously felt at the end that every character in the Philippe household, especially Philippe, was a secret submissive  masochist.<br /><br />Oh wait: besides his pizazz and lack of education, he turned out to be a really good painter. You know, because he worked at it for a week or two. So there, give him $30K for the doodle fancy artsy people like; he deserves it because... because he is Driss, get it? And the movie goes on like this! It is so outrageous that it's almost objectifying to the character. Why is everyone so happy and willing to play second fiddle to a thug? Try as he might the man just can do no wrong.<br /><br />Here's the compelling point: there was nothing during the initial interview that justified to the viewer that Driss should have gotten the job and if he had turned out to be a psychotic killer who stole (well, he actually did that too), raped and murdered a few in the household nobody would/should have been surprised.<br /><br />(SPOILER AHEAD) To add insult, there is some Hollywood kitsch here as well. Oh, Driss you charmy womanizer, so you like Philippe's secretary? Well she'll flirt with you through the whole movie but guess what: she's a lesbian! How do you like THAT? But wait, she'll hint that she might be into something kinky after all (wink-wink!)... This tripe is so unoriginal and trite is hardly worth commenting on. But this is what passes for funny in this movie.<br /><br />I find it very surprising this has been such a smash hit, especially in Europe where so many sophisticated yet watchable gems have been released in the last several years. Even here, most of the negative reviews complain about the movie being in French or an unplayable DVD, nothing about the lack of substance of this film. This is the most over-rated and over-hyped movie since Slum Dog Millionaire; it is as simplistic (more so actually) and just as contrived.<br /><br />Am I blind to the genius of this movie? Not really, apparently, sometimes the rest of the world is just wrong.w that justified to the viewer that Driss should have gotten the job and if he had turned out to be a psychotic killer who stole (well, he actually did that too), raped and murdered a few in the household nobody would/should have been surprised.<br /><br />(SPOILER AHEAD) To add insult, there is some Hollywood kitsch here as well.

193700788X|5.0|So, Sookie grows up. I enjoyed revisiting the older characters, Barry, Bill and Quinn. I want to believe I missed the emphasis on the blessing of the fertile grounds. I am sure C Harris has some thing to say with the repeating theme around fertility. C Harris does this thing with life and death where she romanticizes them both throughout the series and maybe she can be seen as making a choice by simply choosing a different colored lens through which to view the lives and circumstances of her characters in this her last Sookie Stackhouse novel. This was surely a page tuner and a fast and easy novel to read, as the series has been. I am happy that it;s over. She ties up (most) all loose ends for the Sookie character, and she leaves  room for a possible sequel in New Orleans with new characters, and maybe a little more mystery and maybe some (sci fi) and less romance.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This is a great album. Mustaine is one of the all time brilliant songwriters. I can't believe he's still churning out stuff this good after all these years. Great riffs throughout, the band sounds awesome.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|I am a huge fan  of mystery, detective, crime tv series and books.  The actor playing Jackson Brody in this series is spot on and very believable, human, and sexy.  Since viewing the series I have started reading Kate Atkinson's books and the TV series is true to the books.  The emphasis is not on gore or violence or forensics.  It's really about the mystery of death and loss in life and how we find redemption or at least carry on. Can't wait for the second season to be available.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like Google and I prefer it to other search engines. I'd have given it five stars, but nothing is perfect.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|My son likes this movie but I would say it's only ok.  He actually played the DVD many times and ended up scratching the bottom so we had to buy it again.  Then he never watched it again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love the game.  Its pretty to look at and the music is very soothing.  Even the movement of the drop was soothing.  Ive never had it lag or freeze up.
6305327041|5.0|This is a great Quentin Tarantino movie.  4 different stories to make one plot.  Very funny and like I already said, classic Tarantino.  \\"BEHAAAVE!\\" (You'll have to watch it).
B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones are awesome.  This is the first pair of wireless headphones I've owned so I can't really compare but I have to say the freedom to be cleaning house while talking to my sister on Skype is great.  We also have lots of laughs talking to each other in the voices programmed to these.  I use them to game, listen to youtube, Pandora, and Skype.  They are a bit bulky but they block out almost all external noise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I dont have to go on the internet anymore... Way faster. Tends to freeze. But other than that itz amazing.!! (;
B00992CF6W|5.0|first off I like the game but why always 5 days later then iphone for just 0.7.1 and blocklauncher pro is so useful u get mods,texture packs,online multiplayer,and additional addons like double tap to sprint mod (its obviously a minecraft pe patched) just go to options
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft does not suxk. Its amazon that sucks. Theres been two updates and amazon doesnt even care probably. Just switch to google play.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have only viewed about 6 episodes so far, but the quality is great to this point.  Collection is presented nicely with cards for each season indexing the DVDs in the collection.  It arrived a day earlier than scheduled and I have no complaints with the purchase at all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is such a fun game to play, it's so amazing to get to buy tack for your horse and get new features to the game. I give it  a perfect 5 STARS
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There is so much action and excitement I couldn't stop reading the book. It's as if I was in the middle of the action.
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|I totally understand the graphic novel, pictures to tell the story, I get it.  I was not overly impressed with this one.  I totally love the Outlander series and have read most of them and some of the Lord John series and am in love with these.  I just wasn't impressed with the wording, the characters seemed a bit odd (even though I know them from the series),  I had a hard time deciding who was speaking to whom. I didn't even finish the book, I got lost about 1/2 way through and put it down, I have never done that with any of the other books.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Gets the job done, pretty accurate and simple design as well as interface and does not suck up battery life
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sub way surf is very fun at times and some times it mess es up but it's fun and cool  so keep it going
B004XISI4A|4.0|Great entry from GRRM. Only 4 stars because of the pacing of the book is unbalanced. Can't wait for book 6!
B003YJEXL6|5.0|A must read for humanity. This book challenges a lot of assumptions that hurt us both individually and collectively. One of the most important books I have ever read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really wanted to get Minecraft PC but I struggle so I decided to Get the PE version<br />And I did! I really like this app But when is the 0.7.0 update coming out on kindle?
0783231202|5.0|Another Steven Spielberg creation.  Introduced an actor Djimon Hounsou to the viewing world.  A story worthy of telling---revolt.  Wonderfully written.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Amazing movie! I love Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law together and Guy Ritchie does a fantastic job. One of my favorite movies!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm entrapped in this story!! So passionate, such a deep love story! I can't get enough! Can't wait to read the next book!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I'm glad I purchase this and cant get enough this movie and what is next to come from this crew
B009NY43NY|3.0|I love sookie stackhouse.  I love vampires and werewolves - I've read every one of these novels and I think the Author is running out of story lines.  I liked it but it was sort of lackluster compared to the first ones.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Girls that kick butt is always a good movie to watch and own. And its a action movie that rocks
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  You have to pay attention to the characters because it's about an entire family so sometimes you have to think back to who the person is and their relationship to keep on track. But it's a good read and makes you think of your own family and history, how things that happen can radically affect everyone else.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I have all three in one case and the movies are so awesome and I glad it was the trilogy and not buy it separately.
B0085TJUGI|5.0|If you can truly feel as Anita felt during her NDE, or at least how you think she felt, then this book will change your life. The mind set Anita espouses melds perfectly with mindfulness. May we all allow ourselves to feel and appreciate how magnificent we really are. Read this book!

B002HML6Y8|4.0|Take a drink for every time a human character flew through the air. Though if you play, you may die ten minutes in, so I don't recommend it. The movie is ridiculously action-packed, but it's fun, and the plot is simple enough to follow, despite all the convoluted mumbo jumbo it throws at the audience. The visual effects are very good up until the end, where werewolf-Van Helsing fights Dracula. I'm guessing the effects company ran out of time and had to cut corners to complete the work. Dracula's hair and Van Helsing's fur looked fake while they were fighting.<br /><br />Despite the shortcuts, the movie is a visual feast. The cinematography is colorful and lends a wonderful texture to the world. Alan Silvestri's music sets the mood perfectly, and the actors have great chemistry. I'm one of the few people who loved Kate Beckinsale's Transylvanian accent.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Van Helsing\\" is a fun, well-paced monster movie that I've watched numerous times over the years.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|would have liked a bit more suspense. Otherwise the tiger was beautiful. good portrayal of human verus wild beast. The tigers behavior at the end shouldn't srprise because some humans act the same way.
193700788X|5.0|Oh my god , I chose the rating because it was a good book. did not like the cliff hanger though. I wish there was another book in the series I would really recommend this book
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I read this book after a reddit AMA that James Altucher did.  I loved some of his crazy alternate philosophy's on life and on finances that really shine in contrast to what public schools and society in general tell you what you have to do.  I agree that success starts with yourself, and being healthy all around.  I also love the optimism he has in the book for entrepreneurs from all walks of life, technology and the internet have reduced the barriers to enter limitless markets, enabling anyone to work for themselves and to choose how they want to live their own lives.  It is definitely written in a unique style which I appreciated for the most part.  It has the feeling that he wrote it in just a few days last week, because it is very current and very raw feeling.<br /><br /> I'm not sure how much of his choose yourself daily practice and advice I really committed to memory though, and it is a little hard to take away and remember the concrete steps and advice offered in the book, because there is so much of it and it sometimes feels like it is all over the place.<br /><br />Overall I would reccomend this book to anyone who needs a little bit of encouragement to take a risk, get out of a rut, and make changes in their lives that are against what society tells you but in the end best for yourself.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I found this book to be filler. We didn't really learn anything new about the people involved. I loved the first and second book and I look forward to the next but this book is a miss.
0307895475|5.0|I first saw this beast while buying some games from Gamestop. Holy crap. This book is BEYOND massive! It's 800 or so pages, like a lengthy book, but then you have to factor in that each page is just about 2 times that of a normal novel. In essence, this is 1600 pages of a thorough breakdown of everything Skyrim has to offer, and I mean EVERYTHING.<br />Be careful, as this book may make a good weapon to be used by family members, girlfriends, boyfriends, friends, or anyone who is angered by your new addiction.

1781162646|4.0|I saw the plot of this novel largely as an allegory of life.  As in life, there are tremendous elements of sadness, early deaths, unfair illnesses,  unrequited love, murders.  And then there is Joyland, where children, and adults, can find respite from the sadness.  Some of the scenes of the happiness created in Joyland were truly amazing.  Outside of the amusement park, there are also elements of the pure ecstasy that Joyland sometimes mirrors.  This intricate intermix of sadness and joy and the gradual revelation of the details of the lives of the characters made this book very absorbing to me.  The weakest part of the book was the mystery of who was the killer of several girls.  This is solved at the end in only a fairly satisfactory way.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars, I would!! I won't give spoilers, cause guess what.....I'm not even done reading it & I LOVE IT!! I've never done this b4, this book had grabbed me & hasn't let go!! A book that can pull an emotion from me, I'm THERE! The first one I loved, the second one I loved, this one, I just can't put into words! And u know what, I don't even care how it ends!! I'm satisfied completely where I stopped!! I'm gonna finish, but I needed a break from the emotions this book pulled out of me! In all my \\"romanticism\\" I could never pull something like this out of my head! Gideon & Eva.....raw passion, that's it!! I don't care how screwed up or emotionally damaged they r, the chemistry is like nothing else!! There were those that complained about \\"too much sex\\" in the book, guess what, I didn't care!! Fill a book up with sex, when it's done RIGHT!! The sex scenes r passionate & breathtaking, I don't always need a lot of angst, stories, & characters in a read, give me a passionate love story about a man & a woman any day & I'm a happy customer! If ur not into anything I said, then this book, & the Crossfire series, is not 4 u! I've read good books that have come close 2 this (The Blackstone Series, Real, Connected, The Edge of Never, love those) but this one has topped everything I've read! Even fifty shades, which I thought was good, can't compare that I actually had 2 stop reading!!! And 2 the \\"book police\\" that felt the need 2 \\"reprimand\\" me when I didn't know a 4th book was coming out after a trilogy.....r u going 2 reprimand everyone who didn't know about more Crossfire books??? And the shocking thing 2 me is, no one, absolutely NO ONE had a problem w/ the author adding a 4th book 2 a trilogy I was reading, but so many customers r upset over the Crossfire series continuing!! I don't care if she adds a 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th book, I will read them all!!!! So there u go book police, I DO know there r more books coming! #stayoffmyreviews!!!!

B003G4W49C|2.0|I gave it two stars because it started out good a little bit started happening after that there nothing only wanted to keep reading hoping it would pick up, it had me doing this the whole book.It was like a bad joke that the punch line is not funny. I will not waste anymore of my life reading book two. Three kids one six years old he is what the whole book's story is based on. He is sent to school to save the world. Pure nonsense.

B003VANOFY|3.0|This headset is nicely constructed. It's comfortable easy to wear for extended periods of time. The speaker sound quality is great and the main mic (non-sidetone) also very good.<br /><br />Unfortunately this wireless headset loses connection for a few seconds every hour or so which is extremely annoying. The sound stops, then it beeps a few times as it reconnects. Even with full battery and the receiver placed less than 3 feet away it loses connection. The microphone &#34;sidetone&#34; is also pretty bad. If you turn it up so you can hear yourself talk it sounds scratchy so you will basically never use it.<br /><br />There is also a small issue with the power button. You have to hold it about 2 seconds before it turns on, but you have to hold it 4 to 7 seconds to turn it off. If you don't hold it long enough the headset doesn't power off so it sometimes takes a few tries if you are not paying attention.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Logitech products. I have a 5.1 THX surround sound system by Logich and it's amazing. However, this product is a big disappointment and it definitely was not worth $130.

0525423281|5.0|Below is a small excerpt from my review - check out the full review @<br />http://bookgirlfromsouthcarolina.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/review-of-lola-and-the-boy-next-door-by-stephanie-perkins/<br /><br />I just wanted to say that I love Stephanie Perkins' writing. While Anna was light and funny, I saw this book with more depth and a better connection to the characters, but as always the writing was effortless and flawless. There were no gaps or blank spots where things just skipped from one section to the next - every bit was well thought through for the best experience for the reader. Lately, i have read a few books that were written choppy, without the best interluds and I didn't worry about that here at all - this book was beautifully written.<br /><br />5. Overall Review:<br /><br />Now - I'm not any huge reviewer - but here's my two cents...<br /><br />*****<br /><br />I give \\"Lola and the Boy Next Door\\" 5 out of 5 Sunshines in my book! Check it out! It's a definite keeper and a re-reader! While I do wish we had seen a teeny bit more of Anna and St. Clair - i was entranced by Lola and Cricket's story and I cannot imagine anyone not being pulled in to their world - I sincerely hope this is not the end of their story!<br /><br />To see my ful review check it out at: http://www.bookgirlfromsouthcarolina.wordpress.com

B004LLDN3A|4.0|It's exciting! My daughter and husband love it so much. Tjis movie is old thing but It is still interesting.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. This book was recommended to me by a co-worker who normally we don't share the same reading taste. We've passed recommendations back and forth and never do we ever agree on the same book. However, here is one where we both enjoyed it to the max.<br /><br />The first page is all you need. There is no set up and waiting for the story begin, it's like riding in a race car and the driver puts the pedal to the metal. Whoa!! And it basically kept that momentum the entire length of the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed both main characters Augustus and Hazel. I loved their growth through the book, individually and together. They were definitely a match made for each other. I loved the little quirks Augustus had and the way he treated Hazel and others in the support group.<br /><br />My favorite character in the support group was Isaac. I think my reason for saying this was because of his two major obstacles he faced in the book, as well as everyone thought of him as their little brother.<br /><br />My least favorite character was Van Houten. Well at least at the beginning of the book. By the end of the book I wasn't so hard on the man, probably because I understood him better. I think Augustus had figured him out as well.<br /><br />My largest contemplation in the book was the parents of both Hazel and Augustus. Learning of the ways they were dealing (or not) and how they were helping the patient to deal (or not), was very interesting to me. In the book Me Before You by JoJo Moyes, the parents of Patrick I also found interesting in their handling of their son's illness and his choices. I could see alot of similarities between the two books, so if you haven't read either one they are both excellent books!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all readers; young, old, male, female, healthy, ill, etc.. It is just a great book!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|When I read 50 shades of grey, one of my complaints were the endings - you had to purchase the next book to find out what happens.  For that reason I was particularly happy with the way Ms Day wrote her books - they were  continuing stories but each had a beginning and and end.  Not so with this book.  The story when on and then just stopped with a note from the author that more was coming but no clue when or what the title would be.  I was so disappointed that I probably won't buy the next one whenever it comes out.  Not fair to the faithful readers who expect more from favorite authors.  It was like this entire book was an afterthought
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book came as a suggestion from a coworker. I loaded it onto my Kindle and began reading. I was quickly drawn in at the beginning, as the prologue had me hooked. As I continued to read, I felt the story just went along without a lot of ups and downs. I also wasn't sure what it was that my coworker saw in this book. However, as I continued to read and reach near the very end, I definitely connected with the book. There is so much at the end that is revealed that reels you back through all of the happenings of the story. .<br /><br />I loved all of the characters, not so much in that I liked them all, but that I could definitely identify with each and everyone. Lou's family was a great addition to her story with Will. And Will's family, obviously a very different socioeconomic type family, was also a great addition to his story. The depth that these characters brought to the story, the story itself unfolded without a lot of action.<br /><br />This is definitely an author I am wanting to read more from. However, my hang up is which book? I'm afraid I'll pick the wrong one and be very disappointed and would love to have another great read. If you've read anything else or have any knowledge as to the other books by Jojo Moyes, leave me a comment.<br /><br />I recommend this book to readers of all types of fiction. While it is listed as a romance, it is much more with all of the family and social issues that are presented throughout the book.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This is my first book review in the history of all the hundreds/thousands of books I've read and all the many many books I've purchased from Amazon.  I am so annoyed with this book that I feel compelled to write it though. In short, EVERY BOOK CANNOT BE ANOTHER FIFTY SHADES TRILOGY.  Or in this case, a never-ending series of books. I loved the first book; was more drawn in by the second; and this one ... well it was just a book. It had a beginning, middle and end but that's about all I can say.  It took a long time to get nowhere and at the end, when I found out there would be another book, I was just done.  I get that a bunch of authors are trying to capitalize on the success of the Fifty Shades books.  There are sooo many knockoffs right now and the new thing is the 10-part book.  Well, just write the whole story and digest it into a format we can read at one time and stop trying to milk your fans for as much money as you can.  Unless the next book is DRASTICALLY different AND wraps this dang story up, I will NOT be paying another 10 bucks for it.  For all you folks trying to figure out whether to buy this book in the series - save your money.  It's only about 25 pages of additional storyline from book 2.

As a fan of Megadeth since the beginning, this certainly is a switch. it's sad people will need to get the bonus track version to get a couple of good Megadeth songs. I will have to admit I did like Risk a little better than this one though.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|Let it be stated that I did not buy this product and never will.  Though my brother thought it hilarious, I thought it long-winded, WAY TOO TOO TOO LONG, overblown, dull, formulaic, patronizing, NOT FUNNY, and a waste of the filmmaker's energies and money.  I mean, seriously folks...

0689878451|5.0|This story is so cute and the fact that it is real blew my mind. I got this story for my friend's baby shower who requested that everyone bring a book to build her soon to be son's library. I thought it was a great story to teach diversity, after I read it I thought I will be getting this for everyone of my friends children. I do not have my own kid but when I do this will be one of the first books I get. I think its a great one that you can read to them and one day they can read themselves. It teaches love a diversity and that is just a great thing!
193700788X|1.0|This final book in the series was such a disappointment to read, I wish I could have rated it with no stars whatsoever, but that isn't an option.<br /><br />This book was written as though Ms Harris gave up on the series and let someone else who knew very little about it write the thing. Continuity is lacking and it's as though she didn't remember what she'd written before this last one.<br /><br />I won't post spoilers, but will say that the end of the book made absolutely no sense in the flow of the series. I will never again read another of Charlaine Harris' books.

B004LROUW2|3.0|A behemoth to tackle on two fronts: its near 1,000 pages and my first effort to read Murakami.<br /><br />The former is easy to understand, I'm sure. With that sheer length any author is bound to excite and bore a reader. I'm not quite sure what this three-part book's sine wave would look like, but there are waves and troughs.<br /><br />With respect to the story, I feel it will stick with me a while as I don't quite know what to make of the many loose threads. The two protagonists, fate-bound lovers whose lives haven't intersected in 20 years, are drawn into an alternate universe that is -  how should I describe it - bizarrely supernatural. Here we have two moons, the somehow-evil Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfish Little People, and hollow human-ish translators of the metaphysical. Throughout, readers will also experience literary an pop culture references galore, as well as an unrepentant dose of coincidence and trust in all that the two hero's, Tengo and Aomame, separately recognize and accept. They coast forward together towards each other, essentially nonplussed by things like a second moon suddenly appearing. They focus on one another internally, then, over the course of 1,000 pages, move those thoughts into a more actionable practice.<br /><br />It's a very slow-boil to get to where things are going. That's not a bad thing, inherently. Upon finalizing, I should feel something about Tengo and Aomame meeting again and escaping 1Q84 or \\"cat town\\" and yet I don't. I'm not sure if that is what Murakami intended to instill readers with, their own sense of fate about an ending, but that's what happened here. He's left me very curious, though, about the alternate reality of 1Q84. Throughout the story, you can tell he had no intention of drawing those pieces out any further than he had to, as clearly that would eliminate the story's mysterious qualities.<br /><br />I mentioned this was my first Murakami. I came to this book only be reading a brief review in the New York Times.  It sounded just up my alley. What I've learned throughout is that this book, frankly, includes a number of plot devices and themes that Murakami utilizes regularly throughout his books: musical references, cats, dissociative characters, etc. These all take up hefty space in the book and I never was quite see what to make of the ideas usually expressed through their entry or presence in the story. Perhaps they reference earlier ideas much more deeply than I recognized. Perhaps not. However, you can feel the weight when Murakami invokes a lyrical refrain or musical passage. I'd simply summarize this by saying I often felt I missed something.<br /><br />All that said, I'll be scratching my head quite a while with this one. It's an interesting book - from its pacing to emotional distance, from its rich descriptions all the way to its supernatural tendencies. That said, perhaps the suggestion echoed in many of the reviews would have done me well: if this is your first time reading Murakami, do not start with 1Q84. I'll assess that suggestion should I look to his earlier work. I'm not sure I will.
B005544TRQ|4.0|The chemistry between the duo is fantastic!! Dialogues are extreme well written and the symbiosis between all the characters is really good. The only problem with the plot is that the firm is shown to be extremely righteous, which seems a bit un-real.

How he picked himself up from losing 1 million cash a week, every week for a summer. How he picked himself up from the floor when he was desperately crying. How he managed to stop killing himself and went on to build and sell a company for 10 million dollars.<br /><br />Even better: get the audiobook. It's like having a conversation with James. I promise you: you'll laugh till your belly hurts. And you'll learn a thing or two that can just change your life.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Movie was a great movie if you are a Tom Cruise fan. This is one of his better movies, I hope that he continues the Jack Reacher Series
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|only downfall is I wish the process moved a little quicker other than that its a great game especially for the little ones
B0043VDIAG|4.0|I found &#34;Safe haven&#34; a very compelling book. I missed the film when it came to my area & was anxious to read it.<br /><br />The plot was well written and the characters believable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book I was hooked the moment I opened it. There is no doubt that I will be ordering the third book
B002QY9RMA|5.0|I bought this to replace my old one and I'm in love again. It was even the Deluxe Edition with a song I had never heard and now love.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. It portrays such a realistic ambience, one that not many authors can pull off. You will really feel that you're hovering over the rooms the characters are in, READ and as if the story really is true. READ IT. that's all there is to it. It will give you new outlooks on life, and you get to enjoy an incredible story. Go for it.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I have always loved this movie and wanted to see it again. Found it here on Amazon and watched it with my 12 year old daughter and she loved it as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever get it now it is so worth it and awesome. You will not regret getting it.

B001EBWITA|5.0|one of the best realistic demons movie. It has very good special effects and i hope it would have another part .
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Tom Cruise plays a traveling angel archetype military cop named Jack Reacher. It's the usual Cruise flair with some good to very good action scenes and an interesting mystery which some people will claim is convoluted.<br /><br />Cruise's character teams up with a morally inclined female attorney played by Rosamund Pike, who try to figure out what was/is going on when an American sniper went crazy and started shooting civilians. Of course there's more to it than you would expect.<br /><br />The real attraction to this film is watching an older Cruise play the Jack Reacher character who has the wonderful quips and badass action scenes and is basically above the law with a relatively straight moral compass.<br /><br />The story unto itself is quite good, too, but as stated above some will rightly claim the clue trail was too complex and/or unsatisfying. I found it just fine.<br /><br />Richard Jenkins stars as the father attorney of the Rosamund Pike character. Robert Duvall makes an appearance as a crusty shooting range shopkeeper and don't forget Werner Herzog as a creepy \\"one-eyed\\" villain.<br /><br />This character is based upon a novel series by Lee Child. Its release was postponed out of respect for the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting in 2012.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $60M and it made a bit over $216M at the Box Office.<br /><br />SOUND/MUSIC: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early June 2013; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B003O86FMW|5.0|More action more insight and it moves even faster than#1, I'll be reading number three as soon as I write this review!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I haven't finished, but so far it is fun and mildly challenging. I like the variety of the pieces and howyou use the uniqueness of each to solve different levels.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This organizer is super easy to attach to any of our strollers (ones with two separate handles and ones with a single bar-type handle) and fits and works well on all of them. I use it for every walk and outing we go on with a stroller, because it's so nice to be able to keep my phone, water bottle, etc. handy. I love this thing and kind of want to buy another one, so I don't have to keep moving it between my strollers all the time. The only downside I can think of is that when I fold up my Inglesina Zippy stroller (folds up like an umbrella stroller), this thing can't really fold up with it, so I have to unloop at least one side of it. But honestly, it's not a big deal at all. Again, I love this thing so much. Highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so addictive but is so fun and exiting and it is the funest game I have ever play in my inter life
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short, sweet, and totally worth it if you are a fan of puzzle games. In a world of match three titles, The Room is nothing short of refreshing.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|Hallowed Be Thy Name Is worth the purchase alone. Must have for Maiden fans. great show from the 80's. bought it for my brother in law and now I wished I got myself a copy.
B009IF7V2S|2.0|I love Will Farrell and Vince Vaughn but this movie was terrible. I turned it off after about 20 minutes.  I'm not offended by sexual humor, but I think it should at least be funny.  Very disappointed and wish I could get by $2.99 back.
0060512806|2.0|I had two false attempts to start reading this story.  The first I got 200 pages in, the second, 350 of this 950 page book.  Both times I stopped in the middle because of lack of interest.  It's odd because this IS my field of interest, being a programmer, but it was just a chore to go another page.<br /><br />I originally bought this book from a recommendation of a friend, who claims it was one of the best books he'd read.  Perhaps it's for some, but not for me.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This is a good movie for every one. Not just Jeremy Renner fans. Story is fantastic and lots of action.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Missed seeing it, and finally saw it and have no regrets. I am glad I finished the series. Loved them all.
B000002V07|5.0|I'm not always the best at keeping up with the latest music and somehow Mazzy Star slipped through my radar during the 90's when this album was released. But, while making my way through the \\"Fringe' TV series there was a song in an episode in season 4 that really caught my ear. Luckily, there are websites that document the music used in almost anything on TV or at the movies. The song turned out to be Fade Into You by Mazzy Star. After a quick listen on you tube and I was totally blown away. Listening to the entire album blew me away even more. Wow, I'm sorry I missed this the first time around because now I can't stop listening to it and have picked the other Mazzy Star albums. I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how you made the new settings and the difference the different people and many other things. Also I do not like how you make the game look like a fake game because it is ugly
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Bought this because I thought I would use it all the time.  I don't use it all anymore.  It adds too much of an addition for it to be practical while traveling.  Seems to work well though.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I finished reading this book for the second time and still had  hard time putting it down. I needed to refresh my memory of the characters and the plot. I am eager to start book three. This book had a whole lot of steamy scenes and suspense. I enjoy Sylvia's style of writing. Now onto the long awaited book three...
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is awesome and so handy. I like that I can pull up the app when I am shopping for cost comparison. And availability.
0452289963|5.0|I have read this book several times, and we are now studying it in a book group to which I belong. It is full of important food for thought.
B0096HI226|5.0|This is a great movie to watch with a girlfriend or just alone. This is really not a movie to watch with your husband or boyfriend. Unless you've got a man as hot as Channing Tatum. This really is a good movie without the dancing if you know what I mean ;)
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Ok, I'll admit I bought this book knowing full well that lots of readers hated it, but I had to read it for myself ... Silly me! Nothing of importance or interest happened in this book. If, like me, you still want to know way happened I will list the main points to save you the effort and your money.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br />1. Gideon and Eva have to pretend they are not together for most of the book (no problem for them, he just moves in next door to Eva)<br />2. His ex, Corrine, is miffed about being led on by Gideon (can't say I blame her!) and ends up trying to top herself (apparently she was pregnant to her husband and lost the baby as a result).<br />3. Cary still swinging both ways ... Gets the girl pregnant and the boy to fall in love with him.<br />4. Eva's mum and dad have a quickie.<br />5. Gideon whisks Eva away for a weekend and marries her ... But they keep it a secret.<br />6. Eva's boss gets engaged.<br />7. The receptionist gets sick and no one hears from her.<br />8. Eva's ex, the rock star, still wants her but she manages to avoid leading him and I think he might have the message, but who knows?<br /><br />Ahhhh! Seriously boring. Not even the angst ridden sex scenes kept my interest. Sorry for being such a downer with this book. I don't mind reading books that are obviously following the Fifty Shades formula, but this author needs to put a little more effort into her work.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this app is the bomb! I love it... even though I'm not that good at it... I at least try :D
B00683JLXA|1.0|This a poorly executed knock off of angry birds.  I suppose if you have a thing for pandas or ninjas you might enjoy this game.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Every song is great. Buy this album.....you wont regret it.  There sound is unique, riffs are aggressive.  Im a Volbeat fan for life.
1452658145|2.0|This book starts with some interesting results from research and the real world.  Midway through the book Paul Tough seems to have forgotten what he started writing about.  He spends several chapters going into detail about how scholastic chess programs have helped a handful of students at a middle school in New York.  In fact he gives a play-by-play of middle school chess tournaments and the coaching that middle school chess students receive.  He finally goes back to the topic of \\"grit\\", which does sound promising.<br /><br />I fault the editor as much as the author for this long diversion into chess in the schools.  It almost made me quit listening to the audio book.<br /><br />There is a conspicuous absence of any mention of private schools in poor neighborhoods.  Does Paul Tough believe that the Catholic and other private schools have nothing to offer in terms of teaching children to succeed in difficult circumstances?
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I didn't read any of the positive reviews, only the 26 one star reviews that are present here as of this writing.  I did read your reviews guys and I've got to say I just plain disagree.  I'm a true die-hard Original Series fan.  I grew up watching Captain Kirk with my dad and frankly TOS feels like an extended family to me.  Now, I don't go to conventions, but I've watched all the Star Trek series and have seen every movie in the theater.  In my opinion I believe that the JJ Abrams movies are far superior to all of the movies that preceded his first and now second movie (into darkness).<br /><br />At first I was horrified about the alternate universe and was frankly rather upset over it for a full day.  JJ just screwed with 40+ years of Star Trek canon, how dare he!!!!  After calming down, I started thinking about it and realized it opened all sorts of doors to him that were closed before, which allowed him to tell new and fun stories.  He was no longer stuck in a stagnant universe.  The really cool part for him, is he gets to benefit from that 40+ years of people knowing what a \\"Red Alert\\" or \\"Photon Torpedoes\\" are without having to go techie on the audience.  I think it's safe to say, those phrases are well known to the general public, trekkie or not.<br /><br />IMO, this is a movie that anyone can enjoy regardless if they've ever seen Star Trek in any form.  Pretending for a moment that these were the first two Star Trek movies ever made, I can't help but wonder if the negative reviews would go away.  I think these movies stand on their own very well.  The acting, cinematography, storyline, action and effects are all very compelling.<br /><br />If I ever were to meet Mr. Abrams, I would tell him job well done, keep up the good work.<br /><br />Into Darkness (ST: ID) left me and my wife (not a trek fan) feeling like we got our monies worth and then some and frankly, it's been awhile since a movie has done that for us.  We didn't walk away feeling jipped or like there should've been more.  The overall experience was very satisfying and I've pre-ordered the Blu-Ray.  Now, if Paramount will stop jipping us when it comes to the releases, I'll be pleasantly surprised.  Come on Paramount, stop re-releasing the 8th version of the extra extended, super wazoo, ultra-cool, gotta have it or you're a looser edition.  Just give us what we want the first time around.  Thank you.here should've been more.  The overall experience was very satisfying and I've pre-ordered the Blu-Ray.

B004ZNB12O|5.0|At their classic best, Pink Floyd's obvious strength are their incrdibly and unmistakenly original concept albums.  This album does a great job of whetting the listeners's appetite for the full Pink Floyd treatment available on their originals, all, in my opinion are classics, especially The Wall.  However, as an appetizer for the full course offerings of their original albums, this collection offers more than youst a casual taste of Pink Floyd.  Even an ardent fan would, I think, in most cases, enjoy listening to this collection.  In my opinion, in just being able to listen to, Hey You, Another Brick in the Wall Part 2, and Money in a single sitting is alone worth the purchase.  Also, the unmistakable lead guitar artistry of David Gilmour, in my opinion, an alltime great classic rock lead guitarist, alone makes this album well worth the purchase.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This third in the Day series is a must read. Sylvia takes Eva, Gideon and friends to a whole new place. Eva and Gideon take their ever so twisted relationship to the next level, and Day leaves us pining for the next book. Can't wait until it become  available! I'll be sure to have it on pre-order!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a great book in the Crossfire collection.  Unlike so many other reviews I am sooooo glad that this book is not the end.  I want more of Gideon and Eva.  I am glad that there will be more.  The ending is not as much of a cliff hanger as other reviewers lead me to believe.  The ending seemed appropriate, leaving with the reader wondering what was next but it was not some major cliff hanger that I couldn't survive until the next book came out.  I am looking forward to the next book.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Another fantastic book by Mr.Oatmeal, I recommend this book to anyone who thinks it might be interesting! A quick but very good read.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great album. Definitely worth the purchase instead of just getting 1-2 songs. Sings are a little long but all are very good!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Steamy, hot, exciting, and Never disappointing...Saying I love these books, just doesn't quite do it but they are amazing.Thank you. I can't wait for the next one.❤💋
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I showed this in my church, and it touched everyone. I have one couple, who have a teenage son whose a little rebellious. They all left in tears, and things have improved with their family. Everyone should see this.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enders Game kept my attention from start to finish. It is worth the trip. I enjoyed it greatly. I suspect you will too.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Ordered this because I lost the cable that came with my Kindle.  Works perfectly, and allows me to charge and sync with ease!
B001GMQALY|2.0|... but now it just seems to be lacking something. Boy meets girl. Boy seduces girl. Boy's control freak behavior and emotional abuse creep girl out. Shocking? Sensational?... More like slow and predictable. (Though Mickey Rourke is mesmerizing.) My recommendation? Watch Eyes Wide Shut if you want something edgy, and wait for the 50 Shades of Gray movie if you just want your soft-core Hollywood S&M fix.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|“Tuesdays with Morrie” by Mitch Albom is one of my most recent books, and perhaps favorite book.  In the book, Albom reflects on the time he spent with his 78 year-old professor, Morrie Schwartz, who was dying of Lou Gehrig’s Disease, or ALS.  Sixteen years after graduation from Brandeis, Albom had lost contact with his favorite professor until he saw a special on Nightline about his professor and his battle with ALS.  Due to a strike, Albom’s schedule cleared up, allowing him to commute from Detroit to Boston every Tuesday for the next fourteen weeks to learn lessons and gain valuable insights from Morrie up until his professor’s death.<br />This book touched me because it is literally a collection of a dying man’s wisdom about life, death, and love.  I have chosen to share a couple of the personally impactful quotes from the book.<br /><br />“Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do…learn to forgive yourself and forgive others.”  This quote from Morrie struck a cord with me because I tend to look upon past failures with regret and longing to change the outcome.  However, the past is the past and while it may be difficult to look ahead, it is vital that I do so.  If a man on his deathbed can make the conscious decision to accept what he can and cannot control about his life and death, then I can do the same with my comparatively easy life.<br /><br />“Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.”  Throughout all of Mitch’s visits with his dying professor, Morrie explained that love is everything.  Morrie quoted his favorite poet, W.H. Auden, in saying “love or perish.”  He truly believed that there is a void in a person’s life if they do not have love.  Without love, Morrie would not have had anyone to take care of him in his final stages and ultimately “wipe his ass” (his words).  We hear time andtime again to place relationships above all else, but that lesson never took hold of me until this book.  Morrie’s insistence on living a life of purpose and love has more meaning than if it had come from anyone else due to the fact that he felt this idea was important enough to repeat numerous times to his student before his death.  As I move forward into a career and post-grad life, Morrie’s words will be on the back of my mind, reminding me to love and build relationships because in the end, those are the only things that matter.
0143118757|5.0|An awesome reading book. Most people would do well by reading this book but it is only their loss and our gain.
B007XWFZSA|4.0|I have read many case interview preparation books, including Case In Point.  What I loved about Victor Cheng's book, though, is that he really takes you into the mind of your interviewer and helps you understand their line of thinking.  I was not necessarily a fan of his frameworks, but he does successfully instill in his readers a confidence to tailor/create their own frameworks and successfully answer a case.  Great insight, and I highly recommend this to anybody considering entering the consulting world or interview process.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. Lots of twists and turns, a very suspenseful book. I have read two of her books and am starting on the third one now.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|An awsome film that most be in every home. For those who are fan of the story, I totally recommend it
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|And then a huge let down at the end! Too many loose ends...why cant writers just write the whole story anymore? Now I have to wait and buy another book in this series! Its perfect money making move, i get that, but its annoying!! Hopefully, by the time the next story comes out, i will have lost interest!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|For those who are big fan of the trilogy and the charaters, this trilogy most be in their home. totally recommended
B000FS9FCG|5.0|nothing to complain about. disk came in good condition, didnt pay much at all for it, and so, got exactly what i was looking for. well done.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|A very good film for those women who are pregnant, for those who are planning to hace a babby and for those who don't expect a babby. Also recommended for men who are expecting babbies

0143118706|1.0|Eat, Pray and Love by Elizabeth Gilbert is definitely in fashion.  8.5 million copies have been sold and Julia Roberts is starring in the recently released movie.  The book chronicles a year of post-divorce and post-affair travel, and ends with another affair between the author and a Brazilian, Felipe.<br />She is now married to Felipe, after some encouragement from U.S. Immigration, and has written a follow-up book called Commitment.  In both this book and Eat, Pray and Love, Ms. Gilbert is adamant that she doesn't want to have children.  It is true that Commitment does contain a few passages about her affection for her nieces, but she seems to feel about children as most women feel about spiders.  But, as even a phony politician realizes, someone who doesn't like children doesn't have much claim on humanity.  Not everybody has to have biological children; many adopt, sponsor or teach them.  But discarding children the way Gilbert does also discards one's humanity.<br />She is a street-wise writer, making sure she got a $200,000 deal for the best-seller before she wrote it.  She has the twinkly eyes and philanthropy of one of those benign Dickens villains.  Her philosophy is New Age.  In her opening chapter she hears God, while she is lying on the bathroom floor, speaking with her \\"inner voice.\\"  This God also condones her dislike of children.<br />Eat, Pray and Love is about a physical journey from Italy to India to Bali, and an internal one from self-inflicted loss to fulfillment.  This fulfillment has not come through sacrifice, but through selfishness.  Here we find a clue to Gilbert's aversion to children.  How many parents everywhere, even in the tiniest African village, sacrifice for their children?  How many mothers are looking after their gravely-injured veteran children?  How many teachers in difficult jobs say that every day they \\"give a part of themselves away\\"?  Who sacrificed the child he loved above all else for this world?<br />But Gilbert believesthat sacrifice is an atrocity.  Read the shocked way she speaks about her grandmother, who had seven children and sacrificed her dreams and desires for her family.  Gilbert is a phony because she doesn't believe in sacrifice.  We also shouldn't believe the claim about finding oneself through exploration.  T.S. Eliot writes that the end of exploring is \\"to arrive where we started/And know the place for the first time.\\"<br />Breaking up a marriage, writing a book with vacuous content, and taking all those trains and planes and buses weren't necessary to \\"know the place for the first time.\\"  Gilbert could have sacrificed for another route.  Perhaps she could have explored Central Park with her child.  I imagine passing her, a woman sitting on a park bench watching her blonde daughter explore the exciting New World of childhood.  This alternative Gilbert is impatiently jiggling her feet, because she has a fantastic idea for a book or journalistic piece, but she knows she must sacrifice this glittering articulacy to gain something else.  She and the child walk back to their apartment where Gilbert's husband is waiting.  It's a life involving fewer words, less fame, less destruction and more sacrifice.  But on this route she has found not only herself, but her humanity.

B00B5AP7NY|5.0|I have 3 children in my house that love Legos. I have read some reviews that this movie is composed of cut scenes from the game. I cannot confirm or deny this, but I can tell you that my children have watched this movie over and over again. It keeps their attention everytime we put it on the TV. This movie is perfect for them.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I cant believe I waited 6 months for this book! I spent $9.99 for NOTHING... Not only was there very little story line progression BUT also the so called trilogy now has 2 more books in addition to the 3 I have already purchased... I feel so taken advantage of. Good Luck to you Ms. Day as out of principle I will no longer be purchasing your books.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful and moving...a lovely reminder that family really does matter, and how easy it is to misunderstand the generation gap.<br />I can't wait for Hosseini's next splendid story.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I enjoy this game, it is fun and has some beautiful pictures in it. The scene are clear. It is easy to learn to play. The only thing I do not like is when the guy is running the screen flickers and then he falls, and it is not me doing it. Like there is a earthquake there.

B006GWO5NE|3.0|The cord is strong and reliable but not worth the $9.99 I paid for it. I would suggest the car charger and wall charger combo deal for $5 instead.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Very good book that kept me on the edge of my seat. The only thing that I would have added would be more of a love aspect to the story.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|It's a bit heavy, but I love how you know when the stylus is actually touching the tablet. My notes have never looked better, and I have never been so excited to take notes before.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|The film drags out far too long for my liking and in my opinion should have focused more on the attack of the compound.<br /><br />Regarding the telling of the story, I fear if this is ones only exposure to the event, it leaves a lot to be desired. For instance, are we to believe Bin Laden was really in the body bag based on the visual identifacation of one CIA agent? No medical professionals performing tests to confirm this was really the corpse of the most wanted man on earth? If these tests were in fact performed why did the film gloss over? The film leads the viewer to believe very little was done after the killing to confirm the identity of the body. I would have liked a lot more time dedicated to why Americans should believe we actually got the intended target.<br /><br />After watching the film I am left thinking Bin Laden could still out there and we, as a country have been sold a bill of goods. What I saw in the film does not convince me Bin Laden is dead.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Temple Run: Oz is a fun and amazing adventure. The scenes of the game is very pretty. Also you play as him it self.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought I would like this series as I am not much on Sci Fi or anything that is unrealistic, as I thought this series was before watching.  Granted, this probably could never happen, but the theme is so strong about what life might be like should we come to survival of the fittest.  People who were around me while I was watching the series on my ipad were bombarded with my sudden jumps, gasps, and groans while watching the series.  I looked so forward to cuddling up in bed every night to watch another episode, sometimes watching 2 and 3, before going to sleep.  Captivating, unpredictable, and I have to admit gross at times.  I found myself getting used to slashing the walkers, much like the characters do.  Speaking of characters, they are so well-developed.  I feel like I know them on a personal level.  Hurry up next season, and if you haven't watched the series, catch up now before the next season begins.  All I can say is Wow!  Word of caution though!  You cannot have a weak stomach.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Draw Something is a really AWESOME way to have fun and draw with your friends. You pick a Word out of three words and draw a picture of what the word is and your friend (person your playing) trys to guess what it is then it's their turn then it just repeats. SO HAVE FUN!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Okay...so, I may be in the minority here, but I didn't think this book was so bad!  I thought it was WAY better than book #2.  I actually hated book 2....and really contemplated even downloading this one....especially due to all the bad press.  But I wanted to see if the story I loved so much in book 1 came back at all in book 3.  And yes...I think it did.  I will agree with others---I think Cary's character became totally unlikeable in this book.  He's selfish, whiney and really just needs to grow up.  It will be interesting to see where he goes from here.  On the other hand, I thought Eva and Gideon's story got back on track nicely.  SPOILER ALERT....what I didn't like though was how their whole wedding was rushed.  We all know Gideon is full of romance and lust...and I was really expecting a big to do with his proposing to her.  All the sudden, this beautiful ring just shows up on her hand?  Whaat?  I did love the fact they got married on their own because they HAD to get married right then and there, family be damned....so them.  But I still felt it was rushed and really could have been drawn out more.  And I wanted to climb through the book and PUMMEL Gideon when he just left her at the hospital with Corrinne.  What the what?  Who does that?  Leaves her, no explaination, and then not a peep for 2 days?  Um, no.  You stand your GROUND sister....he left you hanging.  Don't welcome him back with such open arms.<br /><br />I'm totally and completely confused about this Russian mob guy...but hopefully that plays out in book 4.  I can't decide---was it Dec. Graves who planted the bracelet....or if there is some deeper connection there.  I'm also curious to see if Terry Lucas and his wife become more part of the story.<br /><br />I will say, knowing what I knew (that you all were FURIOUS) about this book stretching into book 4...and maybe 5....I was expecting some big drama cliffhanger ending.  I felt instead like I turned the page, and someone stole the hook.  I am okay that this is going into another book..but I thought the \\"end\\" was stupid---no cliffhanger, no big hook...it was just like turn the page...DONE!  See you soon!  Like the editor called her and said STOP WRITING NOW, we're going to press ! I sincerely hope that if book 4 goes into book 5, there IS some sort of cliffhanger, or ending...so I feel like I can put the book down and wait until the next...<br /><br />I really hope she DOES end it after book 4.  It's time to conclude their story....move on.  But I will definitely be reading book 4!  Let's just hope it doesn't take 9 months to come out!!!
B00BGDQNLU|4.0|The only Coen brothers' movie that actually had me laughing out loud repeatedly. A gem, although not perfect -- overall, it seems (as do all the Coen films) to be essentially cold, lacking in warmth -- on purpose, perhaps, but still, that's the feeling that comes through. [Spoiler alert, for those who care about such things]: Watching Robbins and Newman in the scene in Newman's office where Robbins manages to catch a document on fire and then stumbles around trying to put it out is maybe the funniest thing I've ever seen on film.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Probably the best……… no the best book on my kindle (out of 25) I love th  fact that the story is in multiple perspectives. Out of five stars, this book is a million
B005HED11Y|5.0|I've always wanted to be able to own the whole series but it was very expensive - $100 per season. I am so glad Amazon has this free with Prime Shipping.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I've been anxiously counting down the day this book came out, and didn't hesitate to read it the moment it arrived. I love Gideon and Eva. This book is HOT when it comes to the lovin', and I felt the plot was overall OK. There's more interaction with minor characters...But, without sex on every other page, you really only have part of a book. My major complaint...the ending...really??? I anticipated this being the final installment...but alas...there will be more. So, instead of giving it a proper ending until next time..it just...ends. I still prefer this series over the FSoG books...but now I find myself having to anxiously await until book 4 comes out.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great storyline. A little cheesy, but that just adds to the likability of the show. Makes you stop and hunk about what I would do in a similar situation.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I enjoyed this book. many twists and turns, several unexpected.  But, that's what you want from a book....  I recommend it to others.
B003O86FMW|4.0|easy to read and entertaining. loveable characters as well as hateable villains. makes you want to read the final book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this trilogy. For those of you who are considering reading it but you're still on the fence because of the mixed reviews this is a definate must read if you love romance mixed with some erotica.
1400069742|5.0|Those Angry Days is a wonderful book.  I agree with a reviewer who called it a page turner. After  I read Citizens of London, I  decided that Lynne Olson's future books were a must read.  Those Angry Days did not disappoint.  It totally absorbed my attention. I thought about it as I read the daily newspapers, especially in the last few days of leaks during the Obama administration.  The Chapter concerning the leak by Mr.McCormack of the war plans with misleading headlines was the same as reading the newspapers today.<br /><br />I also learned a great deal about Wendall Wilkie.  Overlooking Wilkie is history is consistent with the period being overlooked. Those Angry<br />Days goes a long way to shedding light on this period.  One weakness in the book is that I had a hard time understanding why Roosevelt seemed to be so reluctant to move forward. Also Lindbergh remains a mystery.  As someone also said Olson really did not discuss the left wing roles actions.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It&acute;s  a great game and the dinosaur selection is fantastic. The money earned on buildings and dinosaurs is to low to make quick progress, so be prepared to spend real money or wait to earn it.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|After reading the series, the movie was throughly disappointing.  The plot was adjusted significantly compared to the book, and not for the better- anyone who did not have the background information provided in the book likely had a very diffcult time comprehending the plot in the movie.<br />The actors overall had a very lackluster performance.  I did not enjoy one thing about the movie!
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|I know Schwarzenegger movies have never been hailed as &#34;Fine cinema&#34; but this one was barely even fun. It seemed to be more interested in Quentin-esque gunshot wounds and predictable plot-points.
0345803493|5.0|Good show I like it and Awesome I wish it lasted longe If it is a good series Good storyline
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Play and slice to your heart's content, and enjoyable game play. In-app purchases take away the 5th star for me.
1416511946|5.0|Good show I like it and Awesome I wish it lasted longe If it is a good series Good storyline
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|It was just rote upgrade, fight, upgrade, fight, upgrade, etc. The mechanics of the game were a bit confusing at first, but it was entertaining.
0345803507|5.0|Good show I like it and Awesome I wish it lasted longe If it is a good series Good storyline
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|A fun kids movie, some material was questionable (storyline wise) but over-all, enjoyable, and it got a few laughs out of me too.
0345803485|5.0|Good show I like it and Awesome I wish it lasted longe If it is a good series Good storyline
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Of all the games I loved on my PS3, this is the one I wanted on my Kindle Fire. It doesn't disappoint in the slightest.
1781162646|4.0|Although part of a crime series, I think this is Mr King's best bit of writing in a long while.<br />It is not dark horror but a coming of age story linked into a murder, there is a slight supernatural bent to this but in essence this is character driven and all the better for it.<br />Young man joins a funfair during his holidays and while at a low of being dumped by his girlfriend becomes intrigued by a murder that took place there years before. But this is the background to him finding himself, growing up and embracing the life of Joyland. Yep, the crime element is still lurking but this book shows the author's ability to write, his understanding of characters and his ability to draw you into the story.<br />As long as you understand what you are getting into, this really is very good indeed.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|It was a creepy movie.  Mama was well-drawn, and she did creep me out a few times.  She's kind of awesome.  I liked her.  She was insane, of course, but I understood her motivation for clinging to the children and trying to keep them from their uncle and his girlfriend.  They did explain (albeit obliquely) why mama looks the way she does, and it made sense to me.  I've heard others saying the CGI bothered them, but it wasn't an issue for me.  mama looked pretty real to me most of the time.  If I had been watching on a huge HDTV instead of on the computer, it might have been different.<br /><br />*Mild spoilers*  The only thing about this movie that didn't seem to ring true was a dream the male character had at one point where the children's father asks him to &#34;Save my girls.&#34;  I was like, &#34;what?  The dad was going to kill the girls.  Now his ghost is begging his brother to save them?  Maybe he changed his mind or something.&#34;  The character of the children's father, and his ghost, didn't seem consistent to me.  Why isn't his ghost fighting just as hard for the children as Mama is?  Don't know.  But that's the only thing that didn't work for me.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I expected this game to be your run of the mill hidden object game but it was so much more.  Not only do you get that, you get a great creepy mystery, cut scenes, storyline and awesome graphics.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The books starts off really slow and picks up after a few chapters, but I have to say the ending sucked. Usually you can yell when the story is wrapping up to end even if it will continue in the next of the series. This book just ended flat. Very disappointing. I felt the author rushed to end as the books release date had already been pushed several times.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it was very addictive to play but it is and all ways will be legend wage for it ......... dary legendary
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I just started and I am reviewing it because it asked me too and I couldn't bear to be interuppted from playing again since it is that awesome. Definitely worth the money. I would payed that extra penny too!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|For the price, this a great deal. We were able to decorate our daughters room with all of the princesses. The quality is pretty good. These are thick decals that look like they will last a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is amazing everyone should buy it especially because its free my sister loves that game
B009AMANBA|4.0|Lincoln is based, in part, on the book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. The film has an impressive cast including Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, Hal Holbrook, James Spader and Tommy Lee Jones and takes you behind the scenes of the Civil War battles on the field ro the political tactics of Lincoln in the push to abolish slavery through the 13th Amendment. The movie also spotlights his personal life with his wife and sons. The stress of the Civil War took its toll on the Lincolns as is evident in his pictures, and a carriage scene in the movie depicts the Lincolns looking forward to better times before the fateful night at Ford Theater. With Lincoln being so loved and despised simultaneously, he is a fascinating figure in history who shaped the course of a nation whose foundation was set on the belief that all men are created equal. This movie contains irreverent foul language and racially prejudiced verbiage which may be offensive to some viewers.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The game is like a mix between temple run 2 and subway surfers, but the game never changes its always the same background palm trees, jets, and missiles it could have been way better if it was actually based on the Story/Movie. I also think that it doesn't give you enough movement freedom, all you can control is left and right.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft in the Pc version so I thought id try this,  turns out I like this one better lol!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie.  saw it when it first came out but after seeing the new one, wanted to see this one again.  Forgot how good it was.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas is completely itself and whole, a masterpiece of filmmaking when you consider the challenges and circumstances of its production.  Made in the mid-90s, it is very much of its time, but you could believe that if you went to Vegas today you would find a Sera and a Ben in terms of life trajectory.<br /><br />Sera: Is drinking a way of killing yourself?<br />Ben: Or, is killing myself a way of drinking?<br /><br />Shue's Sera is not a hooker with a heart of gold but a woman who happens to be a sex worker, and we can imagine that the damage that is a part of her predates her profession.  Cage's Ben is a fantastic piece of work.  We meet these two after the period in their lives where they believed they could change.  That is what makes this movie special.  It does not seek to change its characters, yet is not falsely sentimental.  Even when the characters go through the motions of sentimentality, and sincerely so, the stark truth is always in the room e.g. as Sera sheepishly prepares a meal of vegetables and plain rice, Ben zombie walks into the kitchen to the fridge and walks out clutching two! bottles of vodka to his chest that he chugs in the shower.  Later, with the DTs subsided, he calmly comes back into the kitchen and sits down, and, with a smile on his face, says he's ready for his rice.<br /><br />This film isn't about hedonism.  There is no pleasure here.  Ben and Sera are committed to their lives of indignity, but by the end you bristle at even minor indignities that other people lay on them.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love this; but wish they would update the Amazon app at the same time that they update Google play. I've got this on a kindle and on my Android phone, so my phone has the cool new features but not my kindle... and, since the Play version has been updated, but my kindle hasn't, I'm unable to pay with anybody via Wi-Fi! Both devices run on Android! Hurry with that update pretty please!<br /><br />Great game, I actually would enjoy this MORE than the pc version IF:<br />1. Realms was finished :)<br />2. I could convert my creative mode worlds into survival mode worlds.*<br />3. It had villagers like the pc version<br />4. I could download another player's world easily when on the same Wi-Fi network.*<br /><br />*these may already be possible through some kind of developer wizardry, but those methods are beyond me. I need a button!
1781162646|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started. I was immediately engrossed with the characters. What a wonderful story, not only of a ghost, but of the kindness of people. I enjoyed every minute of it!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I read many of the crime/thriller writers, Robert Crais, Robert P. Parker, Lee Child, George Pelecanos etc. Connelly tops the list. Harry Bosch is an enduring character, who seeks justice for all victims Connelly interests his readers with the procedure of &#34;police procedurals&#34;.  I like his descriptions of LA, As a resident, reading his work is like a travel guide.<br />This story originates with the LA riots but moves forward and backward from there.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|The strangest story I have ever read. The plot is a good one if predictable. I knew where it was going from an early stage, it really is pretty obvious, and was drawn in to see how it would unfold. However, it was long drawn out and descends into the ridiculous. The build of evidence, the degree of insane obsession, and the general overload in manipulation all just sent me shaking my head. As for the ending, well many have slated that and I am with them. Shades of Misery. Overall don't go there. Its disturbing and frustrating. I have to wonder where it came from.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Sender sent it right away movie was ridiculous. I made the mistake of buying this movie before I seen it and your better off you tubing the clip. Sender was awesome though.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The way the story blends in with the real history is incredible. If history in school could be written like this story everybody would love it. The characters actions blend in with actual events in history in such a manner, that they become a real part of history. Who knows, it really could have happen as told... Different names, but similar events. WHEN IS THE FINAL BOOK COMING???? PLEASE HURRY!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome game!!! Thanks for making it free. Very addicting and one of the few games I play. Keep up the great work.
B00AN0KBJC|2.0|Of course it's my fault...offering the HD version in fine print is unforgivable, since there is NO RETURN.  How about Posting it in BOTH versions with BOTH prices on the front menu.  I would gladly pay an extra $10 for HD, but once purchased in STANDARD, there is no going back.  Out of [principle I will NOT buy both, but now I have to watch in less than stellar quality.  Where is your Marketing I.Q.  Amazon, King of Thrones, cheapening the show and your acuity.  Really TOO BAD!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Interesting characters and very creative in weaving their lives together across the continents. However, I found the story easy to put down for 2 - 3 weeks at a time. I couldn't put down Follet's Pillars of Earth.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Hilarious!!<br />A perfect coincidence of historic facts,  the insertion of world leaders at each period  makes the reader believe it actually happened.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|The ending absolutely ruined this movie for me. The entire movie was great up until the last 30 seconds. I hate when movies take a complete 180 in the last few seconds.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Really nostalgic, appealed to both my sons (4 and 10) and my husband and I.  It was a overall good time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great book by Sylvia Day.  The book captivates the reader. I had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait for Gideons and Eva's story to continue.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Amazon Prime has been a great value because we get the entire Lost series free with streaming video.  I did not watch Lost when it aired on TV, but I'm really glad I'm watching it now because it's addictive and with Amazon, I get to watch unlimited shows so I don't have to be left hanging for a week at a time.
0307341550|4.0|I really enjoy GIllian Flynn's novels.  I read Dark Places and Gone Girl first and decided to give this one a try.  I realize it was her first novel, and she has definitely improved as an author since.<br /><br />The plot was interesting and had me turning the pages.  I thought the characters were just a little bit caricature-ish and might have slightly stepped over that line separating the believable from the unbelievable.<br /><br />Sometimes I am just in the mood for a dark, depressing read, and that's when I turn to Flynn.  With this book, I feel like she brought me to the pit of despair and had me peeking down into it.  With Dark Places and Gone Girl, her story and her writing style took me to that pit and pulled me right in.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Simple controls and several options make this game a great time-filler and time-killer. Updraded vehicles make it even better. Great app!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Allows you to see what time during the day inclement weather will happen, and does not slow down your device. Sleej
B002PEP4C8|3.0|This book certainly brought to light the deep suffering Alice experienced after being raped.  Now we know what our veterans are experiencing long with people that are violated by criminals everyday.  God give them strength.<br /><br />J A Druce
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This is a great movie for a family to enjoy.<br />As a 30-something, the cameos of old video game characters was a treat.<br />Good moral undertones of not letting others define who you are!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I took a chance while scrolling through movie titles and decided to watch an episode, after that I was hooked.
