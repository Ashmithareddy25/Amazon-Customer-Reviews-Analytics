B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this movie at the theatre and decided I liked it well enough to buy it. I have enjoyed watching it several times. The theme of the story is very sad and dehumanizing but the triumph of the human spirit overcomes it.
B00464AVXW|5.0|liked everything abou it. cant say anything bad. easy to use. great picture quality. very good movie. i would watch it over and over again
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I loved these stories as a child and at 60 something I still think they are good reading. Pollyanna is just a little bit &#34;too good&#34; but it is sweet.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie greatly exceeded my expectations. I can hardly wait until the next installment comes out. It ties the Lord of the Rings movies together nicely.
068484267X|5.0|How Frank McCourt survived all the injustices of his childhood astounds me. This is a story of survival against extraordinary odds.  You will cry, a lot, but you will laugh too and there are such sweet moments that will remind you that there is goodness of human nature even in such droll circumstances.  I could not put this book down! Everyone should read this book!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It's better than my regular alarm clock.  I can set one alarm for work and another for the weekend.  It's what I've always wanted!

B004GHNIRK|5.0|really long. *different than the musical. like Gavroche is Eponine's brother in the book, but in the musical he isn't.

B008QTVNUI|1.0|In the middle of watching several episodes for season 1 of Homeland, this instant video purchase stopped working. It disappeared from my Amazon video library, and gave me a error message that said, &#34;Sorry, this video is unavailable.&#34;<br />Sorry Amazon, I guess my money will be unavailable to Amazon...<br />Great show, but right now, Amazon is in breach of contract.

B00AU15HPC|5.0|I love Justin Hayward's new CD because he's got some amazing new songs.  His voice is as gentle and reassuring as always.  While the country flavored tracks and the CD-ending dance mixes make the CD seem uneven, there are five tracks that I love, which makes this an excellent purchase for me.  The opener \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\" builds in Moody Blues-like fashion with Justin's guitar work stunning on the lovely melody and the lyric that makes me think it's a guy on his way to heaven, \\"And now I glide into the sunrise, now I kneel before your door; I only pray that you'll receive me & open wide your glorious homes; Stars exploding in the sky.\\" The second track also has another lovely midtempo melody on \\"One Day Someday,\\" \\"There must be truth, there must be love, the world is filled with lovers underneath the stars above.\\"  The soft acoustic \\"The Eastern Sun\\" is the first track from the CD to enter my personal top ten with its lovely soft melody, \\"Let me be in the skylark & the stream, in the meadow rich & green, let me lay by your side, let me be in the whisper in the trees, gentle like the breeze.\\"  \\"On the Road to Love\\" has a great pumping beat with Hayward's gorgeous guitars and Kenny Loggins on background vocals, \\"Time, the illusion, is the game that we all play; Rejoice in the spirit of the day, from the oceans to the mountains to the greatest cities on the earth, we can sing about rebirth.\\" \\"Lazy Afternoon\\" is a wrenching breakup ballad, \\"I remember the days when we swore that we'd always be true.\\"  \\"Spirits of the Western Sky\\" is a welcome return for this master musician.  Enjoy!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|The video stop once and froze once. And we weren't able to watch the movie because it was late. Horrible video streaming
B0010YPTGU|5.0|What  a great find. I got a second one to give to a friend who likes Tuscany and Andrea as much as I do. All the other artists were as talented and enjoyable as the star of this show. It is the kind of music one can listen to over a romantic dinner, or any time. David Foster is a gem at finding the right combination of music, artists, and scenery.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've played a few of these games recently and this was by far the best.  It went beyond the usual hidden object search for clues with an evidence  board.  That added interest plus made it easier to look over clues.  They also included a map which made navigation much easier.  I don't have lots of time to spend on gaming but this was worth the time and cost.  I can't wait for the sequel!!!!!<br /><br />The
1936608898|5.0|My doctor recommended this book after I was having some digestive issues, new allergies to foods and sinus problems.  The authors detail out very clearly how your digestion works in a very clear, easy-to-read way that correlates to the other books I have read on liver cleansing.  Except these folks know how to write and keep you interested.  The book is well organized diving into why you should change your habits to how and then gives recipe suggestions.  I highly recommend this book.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Life of Pi is one of the most creative films I have had the pleasure of viewing. Sensitive, wondrous and inspiring are only some of the words that come to mind when I think of the film's message. Truly, we are never really alone, and if we believe in ourselves strongly enough there is little we cannot overcome. I loved this film and look forward to seeing it again.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|love the weapons and all the amazing things they do. characters are a blast and the graphics are really cool.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|This is incredible! An Eric Burdon release in 2013, that rivals his best.<br /><br />In good voice and hitting a variety of great songs, many recalling the glory days, Eric Burdon reasserts as a Major Dude.  With songs about friends who died young, Two Bo Diddley themed songs, the GREAT &#34;Devil and Jesus&#34; a song about Katrina and New Orleans and bluesy blues this is about as good as it could possibly be.<br /><br />I already wrote to Eric and thanked him. Its another renaissance for one of the best of the MANY singers to erupt from Britain in the sixties.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a great game, filled with close shaves and infuriating &quot;HOW DID I MISS THAT!!!&quot;'s. The functionality issuses are like you jump but instead the runner tries to do a hard right turn. All and all, decent game.

0515123447|5.0|I did not read this book first but because of how impressed I was with the page &#34;turnability&#34; I started the series from the beginning anyway and won't mind the repeats.
0307887448|5.0|Don't be fooled by the reviews and comments. This is 100% an adolescent literature (ie: high school level) novel. The story itself takes a good 75 pages to really get going, but you could breeze through those 75 pages in less than an hour so it's no big deal. I really am enjoying the book now that it has gotten into the meat of the story.

B004UJAOLM|2.0|This is a really well told story about horrible people.  Unfortunately, I can't stand any of them.  Fortunately, pretty much everyone dies- so there's that anyway.  Read it because its a classic and you have an obligation, but know it is pretty much a Bronte precursor to All in the Family or Married with Children or some MTV cast of nasty bitter high strung mo-rons.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hardly ever read but I loved the book and the movie! Can't wait to read the next two books!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is pretty good. Once you get things up and going, making money does not become a problem. However, you do have to keep in mind that expanding your city can take a while unless you don't mind spending real money to expand. All in all great game.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Released in 1983 (the same year I was born in), \\"Piece of Mind\\" is another classic metal masterpiece from British metal legends Iron Maiden, and as well as an amazing follow-up to their 1982 classic \\"The Number of the Beast\\" I might add. This album is also the first Maiden release to introduce drummer Nicko McBrain who replaces Clive Burr, and he has been in full charge behind the drums with Maiden ever since. The overall production on the album thanks to Martin Birch is just stunningly hot and solid, and the songs are all filled with fire, passion, and heart. Bruce Dickinson, who is fresh off from his first Maiden album, of course that being \\"The Number of the Beast\\", is in absolute perfect form on here with his classic soaring and wailing vocals that are just mind-blowing. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray both continue to do what they do best, as they both slice and dice the listener's ears with their crunchy, fiery riffs, and mind-ripping duel leads and solos that are like pure magic. Bassist Steve Harris just rocks the listener's throughout with his amazing basslines as he always does, and of course Nicko McBrain dominates behind the drums with perfectly timed beats and fills throughout.<br /><br />All the songs are awesome, but here are the ones that stand out to me the most. The first track \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" (which is also the name of the classic 1968 Clint Eastwood World War II action movie) is an excellent and epic album opener and one of my favorite Maiden songs too which boasts an awesome drum intro from Nicko, plus catchy bombastic, spitfire riffs, and a great harmony lead, as well as frantic yet soaring vocals, and a wonderful chorus. \\"Revelations\\" is another epic track that is highlighted by more memorable guitarwork, and is followed by \\"Flight of Icarus\\" which is another epic and memorable metal anthem with it's dueling guitars, pounding rhythms, and an amazing soaring anthemic chorus. \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" is another killer track with a great chorus and soloing, and of course there's the album's most famous track \\"The Trooper\\" which of course is another one of Maiden's best known songs as well, that boasts fast, galloping guitar riffs and harmonies, aggressive soaring vocals, and a blazing solo that will sweep you right off your feet. It's that awesome, trust me. The following track \\"Still Life\\" is another great standout, and I definitely agree with a lot of reviewers that this is definitely one of Maiden's most underrated songs ever, and then there's the strong and epic album closer \\"To Tame a Land\\" which features an amazingly epic and monumental guitar harmony near the end.<br /><br />Bottom line, \\"Piece of Mind\\" is another classic and timeless masterpiece that is an absolute must have for all fans of Iron Maiden and metal alike...UP THE IRONS!!!and soloing, and of course there's the album's most famous track \\"The Trooper\\" which of course is another one of Maiden's best known songs as well, that boasts fast, galloping guitar riffs and harmonies, aggressive soaring vocals, and a blazing solo that will sweep you right off your feet.

0525423273|5.0|4.5<br /><br />As I had hoped I would, I really ended up loving Anna and the French Kiss. It was sweet, it was cute, it was hot [also known as The &Eacute;tienne St. Clair Syndrome], it was funny, it was sad, and it was a little angsty like all teenagers are.<br /><br />It took me a few chapters to get used to Anna's voice, but once I did, I really ended up liking her. Anna's smart and funny and a tad bit OCD [she just won't admit it], and best of all, she loves films! She knows the classics! Out of all the reviews that I have read and watched on youtube about this book, not one mentioned the fact that she's a film buff and that she likes the classics. I weeped in envy and in joy when she would say that she got to see such classic films as It Happened One Night (1934) with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Roman Holiday (1953) with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in Paris in a theater on the big screen ! I'm more jealous of the fact that she was able to experience that then I was of her and St. Clair [only by the slightest of margins though].<br /><br />Mentioning, St. Clair, however, I've gotta say . . . va va voom! &Eacute;tienne really is the greatest guy ever. I mean, seriously, I was so jealous of Anna. However, what I really liked about St. Clair was that he wasn't perfect! I mean, he was perfect, but he was normal. He has crooked bottom teeth, he is short, but those are not faults but rather pluses because it makes him so normal. Normal enough so that any girl in the whole world can read about him and think, \\"Wow. One of these days, I'll have my own St. Clair\\" instead of \\"Wow. I wish I could have a St. Clair\\".<br /><br />In reality, the best thing about this whole book was that Stephanie Perkins' characters, not a single one, was perfect. They were normal, everyday people.<br /><br />Oh! And as a Georgian, it thrilled me to no end to have Anna be from Georgia, though she's from Atlanta, a \\"city girl\\", and I'm a bit up north in the mountains.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm really glad that I finally read the book [I got it as a Valentine's Day present from my mother and just now decided to get around to reading to it], and as everybody else has, I recommend this to anyone and everyone in need of a nice light, but lovely book. I also can't wait to read the companion novels to this one either.eally glad that I finally read the book [I got it as a Valentine's Day present from my mother and just now decided to get around to reading to it], and as everybody else has, I recommend this to anyone and everyone in need of a nice light, but lovely book.

B000SXMNI6|5.0|This is a fluid album with one song flowing right into the next.  Obviously AQUALUNG and LOCOMOTIVE BREATH are the best songs on this album, however, the rest of the album is almost just as good as those two songs.
B00BUL0IHI|3.0|This album is 3 Stars at best. I give it a 3.5 due to some of Wayne's word play which is what made him one of the hottest and most sought after rappers in the game today. Anyone who's followed Wayne's career knows that he's never truly been a hip hop artist. He's never been that guy you listen to and think \\"Wow, I never really thought about it like that...\\" Occasionally he'll feature a meaningful song on his album (e.g. \\"The Damage Is Done\\", \\"Man, I Miss My Dawgs\\", \\"Dr. Carter\\", etc.). The stand out thought provoking track on IANAHB II in my humble opinion is \\"God Bless Amerika\\" although Wayne strays off-topic a bit.<br /><br />Anyway, I usually buy Wayne's music either on CD or digitally but in light of the Emmett Till uproar, I dedided I'd not support him and downloaded this album for free. With that said, I will now break down IANAHB II into 3 categories:<br /><br />The Good: These are my favorite songs on the album. These songs have both strong production and solid lyrics for the most part.<br /><br />God Bless Amerika<br />Days & Days<br />Rich As F#(%<br /><br />The Bad: Songs in this particular category had a few strong points but I felt were lacking in some way.<br /><br />Trigger Finger - This song would have been in the Good category if it were not for Soulja Boy's guest feature. It's bad enough that Wayne is trying to convince the listener about a life he doesn't truly live but adding Soulja Boy only made it worse. Wayne has some very strong and interesting wordplay on this track. Meek Mill was supposed to be featured on the album but didn't make the final cutlist. Meek Mil, J. Cole, T.I. - hell, ANYBODY other than Soulja Boy would've maintained the heat on this track.<br /><br />Love Me - You'll either love it or hate it.<br /><br />Gun Walk - Solid beat, nice chorus and strong efforts from Wayne & Gudda Gudda but once again Jadakiss, Young Jeezy or someone other than Juicy J would have made this better.<br /><br />No Worries - Radio has likely played this out for you also.<br /><br />Beat The S*** - Nice verse from Gunplay but Wayne seems to be trying too hard to sound hard. Kinda like Kanye on DJ Khaled's \\"Wish You Would.\\"<br /><br />Wowzers - Gotta admit, Soulja Boy does a good job with the beat and Wayne and Trina drop some decent verses but the lyrical content is played out by this point in the album<br /><br />Lay It Down - Wayne, Cory Gunz and Nicki Minaj drop fairly decent verses but once again the lyrical content is played out by now.<br /><br />My Homies Still - See No Worries.<br /><br />Hot Revolver - This song may take some time to grow on you. It's basically a rock song but the story works well with this joint.<br /><br />*Update: This song is a filler track on the Deluxe Edition as it was featured on Rebirth.*<br /><br />The Ugly: These are songs that could have been left off the album.<br /><br />Back To You<br /><br />Hello<br /><br />Trippy - Wayne and Juicy J talk about their Trippy Kits. Together these 2 are annoying on this track.<br /><br />Curtains - The beat production is decent on this song but the lyrics aren't very strong and the chorus is repetitious and gets annoying quickly.<br /><br />Overall, IANAHB II is highly disappointing in comparison to it's predecessor. After a couple listens, I can understand why and agree with those who say this album seemed/was rushed. Wayne was all over the place on this album and seemed only focused on what is sure to be his next addiction: \\"pu$$y\\".<br /><br />He needs to really get back focused before he ruins what's left of his legacy.is out for you also.<br /><br />Beat The S*** - Nice verse from Gunplay but Wayne seems to be trying too hard to sound hard.

B007OWRBJK|5.0|I find that Most autobiographies are poorly written.  Most of them are repetitive as the author tries to fill space.  That is not the case with WHO I AM:  A MEMOIR.  Pete Townshed knows how to write a novel just as good as he writes music.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great way to spend time while you're waiting for something. been playing this game for a long time. will keep on playing!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A good game that doesn't require constant feeding, of money - you do have to constantly feed your shark. (or else you go belly up, and feel sad)
B007REV4T8|2.0|I purchased this pre sale weeks ahead of relase. The DVD is very poor quailty, it almost plays like a copy of a copy. I did not buy the Blue Ray format...But really...For 17.00 it sucks. My older dvds have better picture quaility on my hd tv.

B00BHMF578|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but did not think it lived up to the hype. Also I think Ben's acting is close to comatose.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This film assumes we understand that our enemies live to kill Americans and we must match their hostility with our own form of relentlessness violence. While this is true we should look at the last 200 years of colonial disruption and world wars that tore that region to pieces and realize it will take another 100 years to make it whole.again. It is a good look in the mirror.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones were excellent.  I know this was a Hollywood imagining of Lincoln's final days, but I found it very moving, and quite like what I studied in high school history.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. I liked how it was written as a daily log or diary.  It held my interest with the details and strategy. I do wish the ending would have been a little more grand.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love this show. In my opinion, this would have been this generations Star Wars had it been allowed to continue. In just 14 episodes the characters become super lovable, the story line is developed into a pretty engaging world full of fun, and the effects and visual aspect is great for a tv show. There are rumors all over that say there will be a second season, but they are hard to believe at this point. The show doesn't exactly end on a cliffhanger, there is also the Serenity movie, so they won't exactly leave you hanging but you will definitely still want more!
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I had to look up what steampunk means, and my opening heading was the most succinct definition I could find.  I'm a bit new to the steampunk concept, but I think it is a great idea.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of running/jumping games, then obviously this game is not for you.  If you mess up, this game shows no mercy and makes you go back to the very beginning of the level. Sometimes I don't have the patience for starting over again.<br /><br />Moves result from \\"swiping\\" rather than \\"tapping a button.\\"  This takes a bit of getting used to.<br /><br />The protagonist is cute, and you really feel for him when he dies and you hear his bones crush.  Graphics are smooth and seamless (memory space usage is 17.1 MB).  Music is just fine for me; there is an option to turn it off.<br /><br />Overall, the game is just \\"ok\\" for me. This game format has been done to death, so new games of this genre really need to shine to stand out.  This game is repetitive and that can drive me nuts at times. Needing to start at very beginning of level after dying adds to this repetitive aspect.  The good graphics and smooth play of the game redeem it, so I feel fair giving it four stars.
B000FCKRDI|4.0|One to go. If you've read the second book in this series then it should be no surprise where th this one starts off. Evie and St Vincent. A bit predictable, sure, but a fun ride nonetheless.

B00BESM14U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Watched it with my teenage kids and we all loved it.  No many dry eyes by the end.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The show was excellent-and the acting was quite good!! We will watch this program again!! WE are quite selective when  it comes to tv-but this program is a keeper.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Life of Pi is an emotional story, but well balanced. Tension builds but is released with some genuinely humorous lines, and none of it seems overplayed. If you've seen the trailer, you know that a boy ends up shipwrecked with a tiger. So - you'll spend the first bit of the movie wondering how this happens, and the second half of the movie wondering how he manages to make it out alive - that was enough to keep me keen to watch. And yes, he spends a long time in that boat, but that's how the story goes. After awhile I started to get antsy - when is he finally going to get out of that blasted boat?! That's just a snippet of the emotion that Pi must have endured. Any movie that makes me feel what the character feels is a winner in my book, and it happened throughout the movie.<br /><br />I am not a spiritual person and I definitely had to chew on the closing lines for a bit until I was satisfied with its meaning. If you don't want to reflect on life a bit, perhaps you should skip this film.<br /><br />My only complaint - fabulous acting and filming, but some of the CGI was distracting. Maybe it looked better in 3D at the theater?
B007FEFLTO|5.0|For fans of Downtown Abbey and sweeping sagas -- this novel chronicals the social and political changes in Europe and the U.S. after World War I and continuing through the second world war -- compelling characters and events.
B009RWP8RC|5.0|This band seems to be exactly what you think they're trying to be......but without appearing to try to hard. They are just having a ton of fun and at the same time making some great rock music. There isn't a sense of egos here. Everyone is doing their part to make these records work. I prefer the studio albums to the live recordings as there doesn't appear to have been much money spend on mixing the live stuff. Very raw. Great if you like that. If you enjoy rock, like hearing something a little different but not completely unfamiliar then buy these albums. They're simply great!

B008220C38|5.0|Very well done. The stage set scenes were difficult to understand at first, but repeated viewing cleared that up. Beautifully photographed. Stunning to see. The variations in the plot lines were insignificant. Bears repeated viewing to catch all the nuances.
B0000524E5|5.0|Great movie with a great cast.<br />The Bar scenes are very active with dancing on the bar and some fighting.
B002QXI2L8|5.0|Some variance from the Greek story that I remember, but I loved it. Very beautifully done. I have watched it several times.
B003XU3MWM|2.0|Even ignoring the many historical inaccuracies -- Romans (wearing pants?) fighting Picts (rather than the Brigantes), etc. -- the movie suffered from pedestrian plotting and trite dialogue. Watch the seasons of &#34;Spartacus&#34; instead.
B009AMANBA|5.0|My 14 year old grandson grabbed it immediately and has watched it. Provided an excellent history lesson for him. Will watch it when he done with it.  Whenever that will be.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Product is well built and the sound sensitivity and noise discrimination are more than adequate. It delivers excellent value for the money.

B004H4XL7E|5.0|Oren is a great writer and entertainer! I would highly recommend this book to anyone involved in business and sales.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is fun and exciting. My son plays it and recommends allowing more coins to feed the animals. It's an adventurous game for kids over the age of 7.
1452101248|5.0|I've tried about 5 or 6 recipes already and I love it. I'm not always able to get my dish to look as great as the photos in the cookbook, but the results have been delicious. I'm slowly cooking my way through the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though it is expensive,  it is totally worth it. I think everyone should have it. (Try the seed cow) .
B00782O7IY|5.0|i prefer movies based on comics, like the marvel series... This is very different from what im used to, but i loved it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Only issue is that the rate of gain, while verys stable is on the order of 10 seconds per day.  However that is to be expected in a mechanical watch.  This watch has a clear back so that the works are visible.  It has features found on far more expensive watches and keeps time better than most.
0547848412|5.0|“Wow- such mixed emotions when reading this book. At times, I could not bear the graphic animal scenes. At other times, there were some lulls. But I kept coming back to the story, something pulling me back in. I could connect to the book pretty well because I have some background in biology/zoology and of course, the religious aspect. All in all, an amazing story and one I will never forget. More than just a survival story. Brilliant and profound.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|It is interesting to review history and to see gorgeous scenery of Old England. It is fascinating to watch the interaction of so many famous people.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|works great on kindle fire hd.graphics,and sound good,very easy to play,but<br />watch out,once you start playing you might not want to stop.all in all,it's<br />a fun game and its free
B008Y73940|5.0|Mr. McConaughey really is at his best in this legal thriller with lots of twists and very believable plot and performances of all throughout. This movie should have been much more successful in the theaters if current audiences had any taste which I fear is lacking.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my mom dad sisters cousins brother aunt and uncles say I'm addicted;) but I am an addict to this one game on there that's called serpent I just beat 10 games in 24 hours
B005ETA5K2|2.0|Don't buy if you are running linux. While Alfa supplies linux drivers, they don't work with this device. The driver does see networks but the NetworkManager is never able to get a connection. Unfortunately I didn't have a Mac or PC to see how well it works on a consumer operating system.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Minecraft is the greatest game ever. But on Pocket Edition, the portability comes with downsides- much less frequent updates, the Nether and The End don't exist, and there are tons less items than there are on the premium computer version. If you play this on the original platform, the computer, it is SO MUCH worth the approx 27 dollars. Minecraft on the computer woukd get a rating of 6 out of 5.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|The Feedly app for the Kindle is a zillion times better than using their website on a computer. Hope they keep the same functionality when Reader dies.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really love this game. It's so realistic and well planned out! My only complaint would be that the creator of the game should either eliminate diamonds or make them easier to get- I work hard to get them, but it gets frustrating after a while because the majority of the merchandise and whatnot costs diamonds, and you either have to wait until you level up or pay actual money to get them. It would give me much more incentive to work hard if everything costed coins or if diamonds were easier to earn. Overall though, it's an amazing game. Very fun.
B001BANK32|5.0|I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I went with too others, one didn't like it, one thought it was pretty good, I didn't know what to think. So I went back and saw it a couple of more times. Each time I saw more and eventually realized it was, typically of Kubrick, one of the more amazing movies ever. Every time he took on a gender, he pushed it to the ultimate. Here is the ultimate psychological horror movie. It has more subtile subconscious moments then you would think possible. And so many intense conscience moments - my favorite is when Shelley Duval discovers what Jack has been writing - that seen just sent chills up and down my spine - and its just some one looking at typed pages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game my brother has this game and we can play together.I love playing with my bother.A lot of people can play with you.Me my mom and my brother have this game and we love this game we love playing together.Me and my brother and my mom are making a tower.
B00BQLSB3A|4.0|I normally can't stand it when people write reviews for things they don't own.  I am a collector of limited edition books and movies, so I don't begrudge anyone who lucks up and snatches a copy of a limited edition item.  While I am sad that I missed the boat on grabbing this edition of Christine, I'm not really that upset about it.  Now I would be really upset if I had missed out on some new bonus content, but as it works out, the only thing I'm missing out on is a copy of the movie in high definition.  Oh, but wait.....That's not really true.  I have managed to obtain basically what is included on this disc for $9.99.  Here's how I did it.  First of all, I already own the Special Edition DVD of Christine, which if you don't, you can pick up for anywhere from $5 - $11 on Amazon.  I then signed in to my amazon Instant video on my PS3, and TA DA!!! there was Christine in HD for rent at $3.99 or to purchase for $9.99.  I chose to purchase it, since it will probably be awhile before another HD version of Christine becomes available on disc.  The DVD has ALL of the special features that are listed on the pricey limited one.  Here's where you'll have to make a judgement.  I just popped the DVD in, and the picture is very nice, but does lack some clarity that an HD transfer might have.  I compared the Special Edition DVD picture to that of the HD picture, and there is a little bit of a difference.  The HD picture does look nicer than the DVD in my opinion.  So if you don't own the Special Edition DVD, you can easily get a copy of that, then if you really want the nicest image available, download the HD movie from Amazon instant video.  Combined, you basically have what this limited edition has to offer.  So, bottom line, this is not much of a \\"Limited\\" Edition after all.<br /><br />P.S. It's also available for rental in HD 1080p from Vudu for $4.99
0062014536|5.0|Requiem includes great action sequences and on an emotional level it provides a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy's story line. I only wish that there were more volumes yet to come!
B005LCECU6|5.0|I was very surprised with this album. Some songs I have rarely heard and played live. You can really hear the early raw talent. Some tracks are not their greatest but it is a refreshing variation none the less. Not for the casual Rush listener but a must for a fan.
B00BF123WG|3.0|A little slow at times which made the movie almost unwatchable at times. The movie was 2.5 hours, probably could have been only 2.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|The best feature film about climbing mountains I ever seen. (I don't particularly like \\"Touching the Void\\" [...] - it's melodramatic.)  I'm a mountain climber with limited by long experience - about 30 years now.
0887307280|5.0|This is well written and although written a few years ago offers a up-to-date perspective on what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur no mater what the product or service.
B0091REZMW|4.0|no complaints thus far though I am new to it. The graphics are great and the flow is nice as well. I look forward to exploring more.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Having read tons of books and articles about writing tips and advice, is at the top of my list of greats. Most others just offer the same advice somehow bundled a different way but King seems to have tired to fill in the gaps and talk about the odd things that are obvious but not often thought of. He does this is a simple yet insightful way that makes you think about your own writing instead of giving you silly exercises to try. I'd rather not spoil it and reveal the content but you will not be disappointed with this. I purchased it on kindle but do yourself a favor and buy a hard copy because you will think of tons of notes and ideas as you read. Another great read to go along with this is Story by Robert McKee-it's a lot more in depth but adds great coverage of the art of writing and story telling.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|A complete page-turner and true to life for those who have experienced anything similar or know someone who has. A great way to show taking control back over your own life.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|We couldn't even finish the movie because the streaming was so bad, but don't worry... we didn't want to finish it.  The book was completely mutilated in this version.  I'm glad it's divided up into 3 different movies... now I'll know to avoid the other 2.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|I happened upon the movie quite by accident and seeing that Meryl Streep was in it I decided to watch it.  Well, after finishing the movie I decided to read the book.  Unusually the book has more to it than the movie.  I don't think I have ever found both the movie and book to be so much alike.  There only a few things in the Book not in the movie.  The book,, of course, is very well written.  What a way to intertwine three most interesting women.  Great Read.
B009MB682W|5.0|It is a very good collections, although many songs are not included. But anything should be mostly judged but what it has rather than what it does not have. For such a price it is a steal.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I watched the special of this concert on PBS which didn't show the whole concert so if the whole CD is as good as the shortened concert on PBS I loved it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Very well worth seeing. Good moral to the story and even more important is that it's based on a true story. Gives one hope for the future. We all should aspire to be like the character portrayed by Sandra Bullock.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|Fabulous. An easy read - very difficult to put down. Very well thought out & executed - intriguing to the end.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|If you like Monopoly and you like Nintendo - this is a great game to pick up.  We  have enjoyed this very much and the characters really make it fun.  Highly recommend.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I just loved this book it made me cry. One of the best book I have read this year. The characters are all so great together, and I love the way they help each other through hard times. This was a wonderful love store that inspires.
1848507836|5.0|Anita's an amazing woman, sharing an even more amazing story. A must read if you are wanting to improve the quality of the life you are experiencing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is a major improvement on the original. The graphics are much more high quality and it feels more realistic. BEST TEMPLE RUN YET
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Do not read this book unless you want to read the whole series at once. I could not put them down. Fanatic.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|This is one of a handful of Star Trek films that keeps TOS (The Original Series) going even as time goes by. It merges the time frame of old with the current time the movie was made, even in 2013 the story line is good. This movie was well balanced with serious action and good humor. I feel that you could start watching Star Trek as a new viewer and enjoy the movie without having to ask how did they get to this point and what is going on?
B002VPE1WK|4.0|You can spend S200 on name brands and looks. But this one is a very practical, strong and lightweight backpack. It has room for all the basic equipment you will need on locations. I always pack two DSLR, 3 lenses and a speedlight (flash). On the extra pockets inside, I put lot of filters, adapters, extra batteries and shades.The only reason I do not gave a 5 star is because it does not came with a rain cover. So you will need to spend $10 on one.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love playing this app. Something entertaining to do when I have some down time. Definitely worth recommending to others that like fast paced strategy games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is a Wonderful series!!  I would highly recommend it.  Can't wait for season four!  Great and interesting acting and scenery.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoy reading Ken Follett.  I found this book no exception. This era of history is one I find very fascinating. Follett put characters to real history and made it come alive.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|great pic, a lot of action fighting scenes in it along with a great cast of chracters in the movie.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|This is not an app for detecting or removing ghosts. It is a puzzle game where you find items. The controls are pretty simple, you point and click and find items the game lists out for you. The game is okay, but I was really hoping for help with what I think is a ghost in my house.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Its actually a really great game to have. It is a very addictive fun game.. :D Yeah its like the best ever. Anyways ~ it entertained my friends.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The author reminds us of how educated he is quite frequently.  He's saying if he believes Heaven is true, then his expert opinion is worth more than anyone else's.
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|... that is not a statement about the quality of the show, but rather a pun on the vampire genre.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Even better than pictured and very rugged. Tried the cap leaking test from what i've read and mine never leaked. Now I need to buy a few more!

159420411X|4.0|There is an irony to Nate Silver's fame. One has to wonder how a person with such an undistinguished past could be come so popular so quickly. He does not come across as a genius, and the math he does and advocates for is fairly simple. He got his start, essentially by soothing the feathers of worried Obama voters in 2008 through his unnecessarily precise prediction of the chances of Obama reelection, and this has catapulted him to fame and a profitable blog for the New York Times. Despite his CV (Univ. of Chicago, LSE), he comes across as an everyman armed with an excel spreadsheet and a few macros.<br /><br />The irony is, far from being a leftist ideologue, he represents just the opposite: an analytic mind that has little patience for bloviating ideologues (\\"Hedgehogs\\", he calls them), and seeks nothing less than the overthrow of such ignorant chatter for serious analysis.<br /><br />The Basic Points<br /><br />1. There is a lot of uncertainty in the world: get used to it.<br />2. Grand pronouncements and big ideas make for poor forecasting models, whereas people aware of the uncertainty can make somewhat better forecasters.<br />3. In some areas (weather and, to a certain extent, climate science) we are making progress at predicting the future, while other areas (earthquakes and the economy) we are woefully inadequate.<br />4. Bayes theorem, which allows us to update our predictions in the face of differing probabilities, is the key to rational thinking.<br />5. There is a role for common sense to play, but it mast be updated in light of new information.<br /><br />Conservatives who feel jilted by Nate for frequenting Democrat blogs and predicting Democratic victories might find his analysis of Obama's economic stimulus interesting. He takes Obama to task for the rhetoric he used to get the stimulus passed, which relied on economic models with a lot of uncertainty. As a result, America became the victim of a recession so severe that Obama's worst case scenarioshe floated to the public to get the stimulus passed were actually far better than what actually happened. He shares the pro-free-market bias of many of his fellow economists, and is very even-handed in his careful analysis of the topic of global warming.<br /><br />What we see in Nate is an everyman who make his living making predictions, and is offering us a look into how predictors do their work, how they try to figure out what they don't know, and how the last thing you should watch before you make a decision on anything is TV. I don't think it breaks any new ground, but prevailing wisdom needs its popularizers too, and its readability carries the day (thanks, I suspect, to more than a little ghost writing, but I don't let purity get in the way of a good read).
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie all the way around. Keeps your attention the whole time. Ben Affleck did outstanding job acting and directing.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|We read a chapter each night before bed and are having fun with it.  short easy chapters with lots of action.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the sharing of new and simple ideas shared on Pinterest. Many can be done with things you already have or things that are inexpensive.
0345803485|4.0|Although I would have to agree that the writing has something to be desired, the fact is this book is hysterical.  I laughed out loud dozens of times.  This book is a fantasy and for all those women out there who won't admit that deep down if a Christian Grey came into our lives we would not jump at the chance to have mind f*%&^)g orgasms over and over again, your lying to yourself.<br /><br />  I think, overlooking the fact that this is a fantasy is a mistake and this, I believe, is where the negative reviews are coming from. One review even stated that \\"this could never happen\\"....duh!  It is fiction....for those who don't know what that means....it is not real.  So barring the repetition and in the audio version, the mispronunciation of several words, I found myself imagining the looks and the smiles and the eyes every time they were mentioned.  I could \\"see\\" the storyline in my head and I do have to admit, I could also \\"feel\\" most of the scenes portrayed.  I suppose most won't admit that, but there it is.<br /><br />  I gave it a four star rating because it did make me feel almost every element of human reactions and effects that a read can do, but again, I do have to admit that the repetition of the email reading was really getting on my nerves by the end of the book.  I have ordered the next two books and plan to get to them the moment they arrive.  So, grain of salt for fiction and overlook the repetition and it is a great read!
B00BF123WG|3.0|There are two different aspects to this movie:  The gathering of intelligence and action upon that intelligence, the actual strike that killed Bin Laden.<br /><br />Gathering Intelligence:<br /><br />I'm not the first to notice that this movie glorifies torture. And it is not just a passing moment. It goes on and on.  And we are given to believe that it was crucial to the intelligence gathering process.<br /><br />We can't hide from the world. Torture does happen. And our government has done it. There may be times when it is justified. I don't know. But I do know that it is an abandonment of our basic principles.  We can question whether those principles should stand in the way of self defense. Reasonable minds can differ. But we cannot delude ourselves that it has not been done in our names. If we are ok with that, then at least we won't be deluded.<br /><br />What is the most glaring fault is that the evidence the public has seen is that torture did not in fact contribute to the killing of Bin Laden. So the film puts forward a view which is questionable at best. The producers are putting forward the idea that torture was essential to getting Bin Laden when the evidence suggests that view is false.<br /><br />There is also the problem that every interrogation expert I have ever heard address the question, believes that other methods work better producing more intelligence of higher accuracy. Interrogation is a very well explored and developed field. The arm chair experts in the White House were not qualified to make the judgment they made, that torture was the most effective means to gather information. All of the evidence is that torture produces less and unreliable intelligence.<br /><br />The Strike:<br /><br />We are shown in detail the arduous path from intelligence to action. It is an interesting and illuminating tail.<br /><br />Then we are shown the team who actually made the strike. I was very interested to see this recreation.<br /><br />I wish more timehad been spent showing the training and preparation that went into the strike. We are given to believe that this team was sort of hanging out when one day someone said, \\"Hey.  Lets go kill Bin Laden\\".  Other reports indicate it was nothing of the sort. Great effort was made to prepare. In short what from other reports seems to have been a highly trained team intensely preparing for a very important mission was trivialized. The movie shows disrespect for those men and their efforts.  They work and train very diligently to protect us.  We should respect their efforts and the very great bravery they showed.<br /><br />We can all be happy that Bin Laden is no longer a threat. But this movie is a poor report of the action and the events which led up to that result.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Like many reviews on this album (mine is the Deluxe Edition), it is a very good album, top notch in my opinion. I liked the last one a lot and this one seems to grow on you after every listen. I am sure it will do very well on the charts as a album but the singles will not have as good a stand on the charts, mainly the US charts but who knows!? As long as they put out solid albums, then I will continue to buy them. So get this one, if your a Depeche Mode fan it will satisfy you & you'll want to see them when they tour in your city!<br />Drop by my website sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" if your surfing the net.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|so much fun. I play it almost every day. even though the point of it is sad (sharks eating people and everything) it's still so much fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A love story with twists and turns, it was interesting enough.  I thought perhaps it was a little predictable as well.
B001NAT05W|5.0|I was so much in love with Julie Newmar as the original Catwoman. But Halle Berry is the ideal Catwoman showing lots of class, style, and smarts too!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|From the incredible soundtrack (sorry for all you under 50's) to the images of the \\"Devil\\" himself, John:\\"...Where's-the-Blue-Label-Stuff?\\"-Goodman, doing what he does best, this film is emotional from start to finish.  Lots and lots of testosterone and Denzel.  What more can you ask? One of his best roles, I feel.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is always fun, no matter where I am, or what time it is.  I can always fall back on this game if I'm in need of entertainment.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Upon my first reaction on hearing the single I thought to myself, is this the best track on the album? it is going to tank? Well, I went ahead and heard a pre-release of it and was really impressed. My favorite track is the title track, really kicks it off, the single \\"Where are We Now?\\" seems to be the weakest track on the album, just me, but the rest of the material is great. Another standout track is \\"The Stars (Are Out tonight)\\". Anyway, check this one out if your just a fan or even a long time fan who might think he lost touch with his fans to release a album out of the blue. I recommend this one! Buy it!<br />Drop by my Website @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" sometime & look around.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|kind of unorganized game play - chips lost too quickly. better to stay on a pc than play this on a device.
B00007AJGH|5.0|I love how they mixed real life with animation, also adding a little disney, I don't like how they figured out how to kill toons, they just need to kill the bad ones.

B00AIUUXHC|1.0|The game was fun until I was just two thousand coins from the Great White Shark being unlocked. The app shut down, and when I tried to re-open I got a window saying I had to connect to the Internet to run the app. This happened once before but there was no problem. This time after connecting to Wi-fi and opening the app ALL MY PROGRESS WAS GONE! I tried updating the app and no better. The game was fun, but given the frustration of losing hours worth of progress, I likely will never download another app from this company in the future.

B008F9E306|5.0|I give this cd 5 more stars. I just love T.I. and his music. I listen to the whole cd everyday but my favorita is 1,2,5,6,8,9. I just wished that the last 2 bounus songs was added to this cd just liked the very first cd that came out. If you got the cd early that it was 2 extra songs on the cd but if you order it now you won't get them 2 songs. But still buy the cd. It's worth every penny. T.I. really out did himself on this one :). 10 stars all the way.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It's been a long time since I was scared in a movie. This one gave me the heeby jeebies. Well acted and believable (well believable if you love paranormal flicks). Definitely a must see. Retro good. If you want special effects and lots of blood, this might make you happy, but it is more of a character and plot driven movie like \\"the Others\\" or \\"Sixth Sense\\".

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed all the seasons of Downton Abbey. We're not usually the type to watch this sort of series but rave reviews had us try it. We were not disappointed!
B007ZFZI8C|5.0|A nice, diverse selection of songs from a avast array of genres and songwriters.  She gave each its due.  I truly give her credit for choosing such a variety of material and being able to conquer each one emotionally and vocally<br />This years surprise for me.....a refreshing change from a surprising source. (No offense, Melanie; I was just never exposed to TSG.)
B007HACDLK|5.0|Let's hope this is no where close to Vince Flynn`s last novel.  It was certainly one of his best.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|By far my favorite book of the honor harrington series. Great read for anyone who likes plots, fighting, and confrontations.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great love story with a few twists. It was very enjoyable and easy to read. Loved the ending! Check it out.

B008OOYALE|5.0|its fun for the people that love to manage things it is great. I love that I can do what I want with it.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Just love this game no matter what your age is (grandmother)i have bought similar games also that are addictive too. Great!!!

B007VUA7VO|4.0|Awesome little app. The only thing I don't like it that it pops up upon plugging my device in. It's dying, I know, that's why I plugged it in!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it like I'm taking care and riding a real horse I love how u can pet it and make it happy I love how u can dress it up I love how u can feed it and brush it I like every thing about it
0062082353|2.0|Perhaps because it was all about the war on the Taliban it was too much of the same.  Other books covered a variety of theaters.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|For the length of the book you fly through it. Has some great advice for anyone not just business owners
B00AW89WU4|3.0|Holy Diver and The Last in Line sounded excellent, Sacred Heart... not so much, so I was skeptical about this one. As turns out, the sound is a bit cleaner and brighter with more defined bass, but real problem still remains - the terrible compression on the vocals. It sounds like Ronnie's voice was recorded 'on the red' and unfortunately, no amount of remastering can fix that.<br /><br />As for the album itself, I still find it weak compared to the others. There's a theory that some people don't like it because it was made to sound more like a Rainbow album than Dio due to more keyboards and whimpy guitar tone, but I just don't think the songs are very good, except for the first four tracks and maybe 'I Could Have Been a Dreamer.' I love the original Rainbow albums with Ronnie, but Dream Evil just sounds stale and rushed to me.<br /><br />Oh and the second disc is a total rip-off.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It was funny, I laughed a few times. She really shows that she is a real person and woked hard to get where she is. It is a great read for fans and people who never heard of Tina Fey(and that whould be no one).
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I usually skip the romance section, but, this one jumped out at me. It has it all...made me laugh, cry, get mad, get happy, and even cuss a little. Way to go Mira Lyn Kelly!!!
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|After BSG and SGU went off the air, I thought my TV days were over.  But now I have a new show to talk about around the watercooler at work (lol)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|What a great little time waster! My 5 year old son loves it for the goofy characters and silly sound effects. I like it because he is learning logic and reasoning. I helped him with a few of the levels he was stuck on, and ended up playing it by myself long after he went to bed. It's good for my brain, right??
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|The Surfer and non-surfer will love this feel good movie! It has a great story line with hard moral compass that guides the characters to an edge of your seat finally, and all with Great soundtrack!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is what true quality tv writing and acting is all about! The production quality as well as the story line keeps me wanting more.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game to play works well, helps to pass the time while at work and waiting for the trian, hooks up with the game on your face book as well.
1439156816|5.0|Humorous, poignant and very informative. He spills it all including his childhood, courtship of Tabby (his wife) and his battle with alcohol and cocaine. These are the experiences that make up a person and give them a reservoir of ideas and subjects to inspire a great work. His teachings are spot on, easy to understand and a goldmine for aspiring writers. Please don't pass this book by if you would like a career in writing.
0684824906|5.0|I had checked Team of Rivals out from our local library after seeing the movie, Lincoln, and thought it was such a terrific book, that I wanted to have my own copy of it.  So I was delighted to get such a nice copy (looked brand new to me) at such a reasonable price from from the bookseller through Amazon.  This is one of those books where one can open it anywhere and start reading and be entertained and learn something interesting.  I love it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It is very handy, convenient and compromises the iPad in a safe and very practical way for children, graphics are amazing
B00AFROVQC|5.0|The book was amazing kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole book read the book now
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|Really good book.  Good reading for young kids. Looking forward to reading more.  Lots of funny parts make me laugh.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|For the thrid book i thought it was great and a great end. The pride you will have in Katness will go wtht the tears you will have a well. It is an edge of your seat read just like the other two book. My only issues is the same with the others when i big fight is about to happen Katness seems to pass out and on to next sceen. But to end the books i did like it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very user friendly and FREE! Would definitely recommend this  for many applications. It's my go to for balancing the books.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|If you did not read the books you would have a hard time following the story.  Sometimes I have think where is this coming from. Everything else is great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series of books was so good it made a shame out of the movie. I could not put these down.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Wonderful graphics, very cool characters....and think we can all conserve and have more respect for water.<br />Great movie to watch with the kids and grand kids,  would love to see it on a cinema setting.
078322804X|5.0|I like that I was able to purchase the Collector's Edition with such ease.  My boyfriend had mentioned that he loves the movie, and it is definitely one of my all time favorites.  Found it right away on Amazon, and it was shipped within days of my ordering it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love future storys and this was by far the best i have read in a while, i love how Card write the story to put you in the story i could not put the book down. Ender is a character that you will love to hate but at the same time you want him to be the best. Everyone should read this it is a little hard to follow but what story with inter-space travel is not.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Promise me that if I review it I can play uninterrupted. Because I am addicted, I love it, and I CANNOT STOP PLAYING!!!
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|Nowadays this seems to be a very slow movie because the global context(communism) no longer exist.  But it could be some way an historic document of the cold war.  Very Recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read this in 4 days I could not wait to get to the ending only wishing it was not over
B005LAIH2W|5.0|great movie have been manly watching on cable just waiting till they stop showing it before I start using the disc itself.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great deal!  Can't believe I got the entire trilogy for this low price.  My daughters are so excited to read the second and third books.
0062197266|1.0|Did not like it at all. Going from one year to a different span of time was not a good book to read.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|I've always been a big fan of the American Pie series and this particular edition ranks second behind the original.<br /><br />The only sort of gripe I had about the film was that I wish there would have been more footage from the actual reunion at the school; however, I guess you can only do so much in a limited amount of time.<br /><br />Still, this is a movie I'll watch many times in the future.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The characters, plot and individual cases dealt with in this program are very engaging and entertaining.<br />The performance of the cast is really very good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and I love how you groom your house. Keep up the good work and plus
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I'm a fan of the books and the movie series.  I saw Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 in the movies but I wanted to see it again before I watched the Part 2.  Enjoyed it again!!!
B004HD61KE|4.0|James Rollins is a good author. His books have an element of suspense that make the book one you do not want to put down.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is super fun! It is great for kids and is an awesome game for people who love racing, but it is sometimes hard to steer. Overall, it's a great game!
8866137626|4.0|The paper in the notebook really does help Evernote recognize your handwriting. It's much better than plain notebook paper, and although Evernote will recognize handwriting on plain paper, I like having the lines or squares. The stickers are a little juvenile and usually I just tag the note once I upload it, but they work and the technology is sort of fun to use. Mine did not come with a pen at all, not that I really cared on way or the other.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best app ever very good free news and has other great stuff in the app get premium it great to
B00729M0GO|5.0|perfect and decent price. Just as advertised and they have send it very fast. Sounds great for me and would buy again.
B000IZ7YK6|4.0|Enjoyed it very much I would recommend it as a classic to anyone.  Ending was quite a surprise but interesting.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|You will be taken in and not allowed out of the story until its finished. So worth the read. Enjoy
B005C8ENI0|5.0|This had me on the edge of my seat throughout. McCaughnehy gave an outstanding performance, as did his costars. Very, very good! Highly recommend.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed each of the eight Balldacci novels I have read!  Do not know how he keeps the suspense building and always asurprprise ending!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Amazing product, worth the price! Love how you are able to choose how heavy the mouse is by adding weights under the palm. Real smooth mouse movements.<br /><br />I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone!!!!
B0098466CK|5.0|I just heard of this band and bought the CD right away.  It really is a no brainer purchase after hearing it on You Tube.  I do believe I will be buying all the CDs they have put out and listening for a long time.  It is my kind of music for sure, heavy early Black Sabbath influences and excellent musicianship throughout.  You have my support, long live The Sword!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The changing rooms and challenges are fun the quests can be frustrating but Overall good game occasional problem recharging energy but very addictive
0062014536|5.0|I too do not understand the disappointed readers. I liked this book most of the three. Hana's point of view and her experiences, her slow realization of the psychopathic nature of her soon to be husband - beautifully portrayed. The terrifying life inside the cured society. The faith the Invalids kept. As for some questions from some readers - Lena had chosen Alex simply because she was in love with him. She loved Julian, but she was IN love with Alex - that is the difference. Some are lucky enough to experience that in their lives. And yes, I believe that even the poorly organised Invalids could take the Wall down. Sometimes passion is more than guns. Look into history. Stranger things happened, powerful events were instigated by few who believed. The ending of the book was a powerful one - it made me cry. 'Take down the walls' - applicable to all of us.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Once again Mr. Dylan hits one out of the park. The master at his most masterful self. Buy it now.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game for children and adults to play either by themselves or with each other, shows you hand and eye coordination
B005LAIIGC|1.0|The title of this version of the \\"Rise of the Guardians\\" clearly says \\"Digital Copy.\\"  Amazon defines \\"Digital Copy\\" as being the iTunes download and NOT the Ultraviolet download.  Be aware that this is labelled incorrectly, and that this version includes the Ultraviolet download and not the iTunes download.  This matters to me.  I was specifically looking for the iTunes download and do not want the Ultraviolet download.  I lost a little confidence in Amazon.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The redemptive power of loving kindness to change even the most lost and lonely of souls is expressed wonderfully in this story.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|This is an objective game we have to collect what it looks like 3 gold bricks but they're not gold they're white. It has some intense parkour running in this game that had me laughing and it was fun to play. the graphics and controls were pretty simple the graphics were nice they were they weren't that bad I didn't find any problems on my Nexus 4. This is a fun game but I'm sure anyone can enjoy.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />-The parkour running<br />-Swipe controls<br />-Graphics were nice<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />- Could've had more control options<br /><br />Overall the game was fun and I recommend it to anyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many wonderful ideas for anything and everything! I have found several recipes that are so good, I make them over and over and find more!
B0055S348W|1.0|Program terminates before document prints.  No support.  And it's pretty darn expensive to bust not work.  Find a printer app for your brand.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game for children and adults to play either by themselves or with each other, shows you hand and eye coordination
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just hate when I finish a book with tears raining down my face and nothing I can do. Who would have thought that this rather mundane little tale would become totally captivating when related by the dog? And that this dog would be a fully developed character whose profound observations seem entirely appropriate -- for a dog? I will read more of Mr. Stein's work later but now it is time for bed. As always I will sleep with my little puppy snuggled next to me, which is as it should be, and I will hold her a bit closer tonight.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game.  The time it takes for your energy to refill is too long.  I wish it refilled faster as I enjoy playing.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it is a great topic, well written, kept my attention, gave great examples and has opened my mind to a whole new way of looking at everything.  I plan to read it at least twice more to make sure it all sinks in. And I plan on reading more on this topic. Life just became way more interesting.
0062082353|4.0|A great read.  Chris Kyle lays out the information (in the first three Chapters) of what events in his life led to his eventually becoming a Navy Seal.  Beyond Chapter 3 is informaiton on his experiences with the Seal Teams.<br />This book gives a detailed account of the experiences (both good and bad) of being a member of a Seal Team.<br />Chirs gives a excellent description of operations and experiences for himself, other team members and his family, to the point of having his wife write exerpts within the book outling her feelings on the ups and downs of being a Navy Seal wife.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in information regarding military operation in the Middle East.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This season made me cry, unlike the first two seasons. I love how the characters are developing and the story. I look forward to the next.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This story tells alot about what few Americans could do and would do for the love of their country and for the men that they serve with.<br />Five stars all around!!
B002PLALCO|5.0|I saw this concert on Palladia last year and I liked it so much I recorded it on my DVR. When my DVR had to be replaced because of technical issues with it, there was no way to get my recordings off it, so I was glad to find this DVD.<br /><br />If you like Pink, you'll love this concert DVD. She does lots of great covers of other bands songs, not just her own music. She does a phenominal version of Queen's &#34;Bohemian Rhapsody&#34;, Gnarl's Barkley's &#34;Crazy&#34; and others.<br /><br />Watching this made me wonder what in the world Pink does to be in the kind of shape she is in, as I watched her on a flying trapeze with a veteran circus performer, singing without so much as breathing hard the whole time. Pink is the real deal! She is a true artist and this is a great concert DVD.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really liked this book. Started out a bit slow for me, but the ending had me on the edge of my seat. Well worth reading.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great read in the Mitch Rapp series. Fast paced as always. I am looking forward to the next one to come out, whenever that might be. I recommend you read the whole series in chronological order to get the full amount of enjoyment.
B009MO5E10|4.0|I am a fan of Joseph Gordon -Levitt, even back to `Third Rock from the Sun' because he got to act with the tremendous John Lithgow. Here he takes on the role of Wille (pronounced Wylie as in Wylie Coyote) who is a bicycle courier in New York City. He works for a negotiated price for each gig. He has an on and off sort of relationship with co worker Vanessa (Dania Ramirez - `American Reunion').<br /><br />Well he gets asked to pick up a letter from the University for a mere thirty bucks and get it to a specific address within two hours. First thing that happens is a corrupt cop tries to get it from him, but Wille does a runner or rather heads off in the mad traffic being pursued by Detective Bobby Monday played with pantomime nastiness by Michael Shannon (of the really good `Take Shelter' and the not so really good `Pear Harbor'). Thus we are all set for a high octane chase through Manhattan and I must say the last time I saw this many `horns' getting blown was in a cheap porno.<br /><br />This is a sit back and turn your brain off kind of flick. It is just a full throttle action fest based on bicycles and a few cars getting in the way and ineptly crashing into things. There are also issues around Chinese immigration and the troubles they encounter in order to get into a country - even legally and the culture rift there is between them and the West and it is all handled rather well. There is also the relationship bit which sits quite well within the stories context.<br /><br />Directed by David Koepp who is more famous for his writing abilities but he did direct `Stir of Echoes' and has worked on `Spiderman', `Mission Impossible' and even that last `Indiana Jones and the Crystal Meth' or what ever it was called, but either way the guy clearly has talent. He crams all this action into 91 minutes so there is no way you are ever going to get bored. If you like this there is a great little Korean film called `Adrenaline Rush', about a motor bike courier and lots of explosions which is also an action fest on two wheels. All in all this is a great film to just sit back and enjoy.sions which is also an action fest on two wheels. All in all this is a great film to just sit back and enjoy.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I couldn't stop watching. If you are interested in English history, law, politics, culture, etc., this is the series for you. I can't wait for season 4 to come out.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I couldn't wait to see this Stephen Spielberg movie with a five star cast-but very disappointed-didn't hold my interest at all
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Wow this album is solid all the way through. Actually might be one of my favorite albums yet from these boys. Good job guys, way to bring your A game!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|The Avengers is a great movie for action scene lovers. This movie is jam packed with action from the get go. Spectacular editing does wonders for the screaming car crashes, explosive fight scenes, and amazing CGI effects. I am someone that could not make it through ANY of the XMEN movies without falling asleep (my nephew is a huge comic book collector and a fan of all movies like this one- and he drags me to them all), I believe that the graphic effects kept me interested enough to keep watching through to the end.<br />  Banter between the characters was also entertaining and it was good to see that Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was the same smart ass as he is in the Iron Man movies. The humor his character injected with needle sharp wit left me feeling that the picture was modeled after the comic book characters and not to be taken too seriously. Dr. Banner/ the Hulk, was portrayed credibly by Mark Ruffalo with a convincing duo of vulnerability and uncontrollable anger. To me it was plausible that he had to work diligently to not morph into the Hulk. But once he does transform it is difficult to control his impulses to smash everything in sight.  Captain America (Chris Evans) is a new character for me as I have not seen the Captain America character prior to viewing Avengers, however; Captain America  character seemed to embody what society would want a superhero to be- polite with a good sense of right and wrong with a side of kick buttness.<br />  I am also unfamiliar with the characters of Black widow, Thor and Hawkeye (depicted by Scarlet Johansson, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner respectively) but was amused and enthralled at their superhero like prowess. I can say that the Thor character did remind me of the He-man cartoons the kids used to watch over and over again so it brought back some fond memories. Now just add the boss, Nick Fury and his trusted right hand man Phil Coulson- who apparently is a huge superhero fan and an avid follower of Captain America-and there is a well-rounded team of egocentrics and bas asses that jab and punch at each other verbally as well as physically.<br />  Completing the movie's premise, you have to have a bad guy who is a true larger than life god come to earth to create hell and havoc starting in New York and planning to destroy all mankind. The icing on the cake is that the bad guy is related to a good guy. Brother gone bad scenario delineated well by Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Mr. Hiddleston has the evil smile thing down to a science flashing it often to make the audience non hesitant to believe he enjoyed inflicting chaos on New York City. Although you see the portal to evil over and over again in a standard good versus evil romp, the wherewithal assumptions of what Loki is after on Earth is evident in his opening narrative in the movie \\"The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power, but our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow. The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?\\"  Where do you think this Tesseract may be? In New York City of course.<br />  The aliens coming through the portal were cool looking and to me seemed a cross between Skelator of He Man fame and Transformers, kind of human and machine combined<br />with wicked weapons and an aptitude for destruction. I give a nod and thumbs up to the creators of the Chitauri awesome job in CGI.<br />  The end of the movie is well worth waiting for as director Joss Whedon works magic, destruction, and humor into a fervor and unleashes it in the theatre. Please also wait through the credits for a little added entertainment. It is not action packed but amusing if you caught the references in one of the final scenes from Stark.<br />  I would watch this movie again, perhaps after viewing a few of the movies associated with this team of Hero's so perhaps I would understand all of the references the characters elude to throughout the film.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you liked X-Files, then you'll probably love Fringe. Fringe excels with its interactions between the cast. The stories are exciting and keep you begging for more. I find it difficult to watch a single episode in one sitting because each episode leaves me wanting to know &#34;what happens next?&#34;<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book! I didn't want to put it down once I started reading it. The characters were well developed and the story was excellent and very believable. I laughed and cried while I read this book.<br />The book is written like a diary that tells the story of Sky's life. Her life is normal and she has her future planned--that is until she meets Holder. She soon discovers her life has not been what it seemed.<br />Colleen Hoover did an excellent job writing this book and I look forward to reading more of her work.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game was so fun I couldn't stop playing it!!!!!!!! I loved it it was amazing I toatally recommend this game to everyone!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|She is such a wonderful singer and have liked all of what she has out there, have all her cds. Just a smooth voice to listen to.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Thank God I heeded the warnings and waited for the DVD to watch this flick.  I was able to watch the movie and break for whatever reason.  If you liked the Lord of The Rings then you should enjoy this..  I have to admit I enjoy the acting, scenery and yes the storyline as well.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|didn't want to put down. Just as good if not better than movie. Highly recommend to read for anyone that can read.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Fantastic, a must see! Love the dwarves and Martin Freeman does an amazing job as bilbo. Can't wait for the next one
B001GMQALY|5.0|just a great movie with a load of chemistry and romance to boot!  It had been a long time ago that I first watched it and when it came out it was pretty popular and after watching it again I see why!
B00338QENI|5.0|This biography gives a detailed and fascinating look into how one woman's cells changed the face of medical research. While a book about science may seem like tedious reading, Skloot humanizes the story capturing the reader on a personal level. You'll never look at medical research and individual medical rights the same way again.
B000KIPT30|5.0|i use this in the house for the tv with my friends all watching with  headphones on and personal volume knobs.<br />and also wile playing with a drum machines and connecting multiple headphones for each musician.<br /><br />- but you need 5 &#34;headphone to 1/4inch&#34; adapters cause all the holes here are 1/4 inch
0060989157|4.0|Still no kindle version avaliable.<br />That´s absurd...<br />How hard can it be to release a ebook or a kindle version?
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun.  I have to be careful to not spend too much time playing!!!  Unfortunately, it freezes up frequently and has trouble loading.  Hopefully they will fix that soon.
0792163710|5.0|Out of all of the movies I have ever seen, Shane is so entertaining, peaceful and easy going,fun and loving,and at the same time, it has it's action, fights and gun play. Shane is absolutely the best Family movie Ever !!!!, I saw it when I were just a young kid, and now I have worn out a VCR tape, and I have started on my DVD....And at the end, I'm never ready for it to end.....I'm just like the little boy, saying\\" SHANE!, come back SHANE!<br />  J.A.The DJ,<br />  Jim Nelson....
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was like a little vacation with some intrigue thrown in.  A nice romantic story, the perfect escape.  I must admit, I loved the end and there was a part that totally caught me off guard and made me love this book!
B006YC74E8|4.0|I needed an app that would allow me to transfer and edit pictures from other sources. This one works great for me. I don't understand all of its capabilities, but that's my part. Could use more helps.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game has good graphics and moves quickly. But it pressures you to mask purchases too often. It's fun but not the best jewel game out there.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Kept you reading until the end, couldn't wait to get to the third book.  It should be a continuing series.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Will watch this again.  You end up liking the arrogant bas****.  The female lead does a great job!  Love movies with happy endings.
B00005LK94|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 5 times and will watch it again, its the most heart warming movie good for kids and adults.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Wish I had read this book years ago.  It is now my favorite gift to give.  Everyone would benifit from reading it
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is be a peice of junk if you are one of those people who are not patient.  you have to be really patient.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Finished the last two of this trilogy in two days time.  I couldn't wait to see why he was so messed up.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Outrageous action.  He's either superman or insane.  Didn't see the 'do not try this at home' warning.  Should be required.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Most of the game I like except for the video adds. When they come on it takes a while to X it out.  It is aggravating to me.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I love this Tv show its to bad that its not shown on tv in my country. I know own the dvds so im more then happy.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|Loaded it, was charged and not able to view it.  Not so convenient at this point. I am assuming that Amazon is having technical difficulties.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Album is up to par with her othrer album.  Would recommend it to my friends and family.  I'm not disappointed.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It's so much fun to try to complete challenges and use all the fun power-ups!  Sometimes i get addicted trying to set a new high score. Great for all ages...very simple : D
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I like this book a lot. Its not classic literature but it tells the tale of being on the wrong side of a battle. I read Chris Kyle's book which was ok but this book was more descriptive. It follows the standard formula of telling the story of the Luttrel's raising, BUDS, hell week, and then gets to what you bought the book for. Operation Redwing. But you can't blame the guy for wanting to tell his story. And his story starts when he was young.<br /><br />I found this book on par with No Easy Day if not better. This book has more emotion to it tho. As a former meathead it tore me about when he tells of his brother's-at-arms fates. He gives a graphic account of what happens to them. And I applaud him for having the balls to do it. Kyle's book was more about him and his love of war. This story was about how war is hell.<br /><br />He mentions Lohkay something I did not know about. How he was saved by an ancient tradition among the tribal Afghans that was about honor.<br /><br />This book was good. And it made me think about it even after I read the last page.
B004G25V9S|3.0|Opeth is my favorite band, Blackwater Park is my favorite album. I love em to death. I also love progressive rock to death. And while Opeth has almost always had progressive tendencies, this album falls flat for me because it plainly is not all that well written.<br /><br />Mike Ark (short cuz Im drunk and don't member how to spell his name) can be a brilliant songwriter. He calls himself a lazy songwriter (I read in an interview once because he is not trained in music theory), but if anything I would say that is freeing. Any case, this album has high points (Folklore, Slither, Devil's Orchid being them), but damn, cut n paste transitions and just flat out uninspired riffs played for a million years, while progressive, is not good.<br /><br />I love progression in bands, and after Watershed, this made sense musically, and I embraced the idea of reaching back to their musical roots (hence the name Heritage). But bros, if you are gonna embrace completely one side of your bi polar personalities it should make us forget about the other, not long for it.<br /><br />That last metaphor was in reference to the metal aspect. Which is ignored, but I found myself longing for, to inject some fire into these songs.<br /><br />Still Life and Blackwater Park I think were perfect examples of what blending Melodic death metal/prog rock/folk music can achieve, but this is the first Opeth album I think is less than good, just because it sounds uninspired and boring.<br /><br />I will lap up anything this band produces, regardless, because until now I have at least liked everything they have done.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was unable to watch it because it did not load...yet, I was charged for it.  I wish I could have watched it.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Fun movie to watch with family. Recognized so many of the games included in this story. I would recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|I just can't put it down... I am not a reader and was invited to go see a musical about this 50 Shades triology (In a few weeks) and I figured I better read the books before going to see the musical... well let me tell you for a girl that doesn't like to read...lol I just can't put it down... LOVE IT!!!!
B009AP2G26|5.0|I bought this season of glee while i was up at my grandma's. This was especially great cause i don't have Wi-Fi for my kindle up there. But luckily with the instant video i could watch it on her  computer. This was amazing!
B0098460O4|5.0|Never heard of these two before but absolutely love them.<br /><br />What is this about how many words I need to write?
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was a fairly good story but ended kind of suddenlike .I think a lot more could have been done with the base storyline.There were many possibilities but sadly none were utilized
0316069434|5.0|Michael Connelly doesn't disappoint.  It's great to find an author who you can count on to be entertaining.  Michael Connelly is one of them.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|An excellent way to lose weight. The &#34;fast days&#34; are easy and you can always console yourself by the fact that &#34;tomorrow, I can eat whatever I want.&#34; The book itself could be a pamphlet - about one third of it is all you need. The rest is calorie counts and testimonials.
030758836X|1.0|I read Gillian Flynn's first two novels and absolutely fell in love with them. I could not put them down once I started reading them. I could not wait to read Gone Girl. I wish I hadn't !! After reading this book the title should have been \\"I'm Outta Here\\".  The first part of the book was very slow and uninteresting. The middle had a great twist which perked my interest somewhat. Then Giilian just seemed to get tired of writing this book!!  She left us (literally like the title) saying \\"your kidding me,that's it!! That's the ending? WTF\\".  GF don't try and knock out as many books as u can in one year. Take a break and then come back with another killer book like your first two!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought this was a great game. Personally i have always loved temple run but i stopped playing temple  run for a while because i was starting to get bored with it. So when they came out with this i was ecstatic! It's so much more detailed then the old temple run. It also has great quests. LOVE IT!!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|set in Washington, D.C.  Intrigue and plot twists to spare, very entertaining as are all of Mr. Baldacci's novels are.
B000FA675C|5.0|Fantastic read! I couldn't put it down because I was glued to what was going to happen next! I can't wait to read the other books.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|this is a good app, graphics are fine, gameplay is nice, BUT it's more for a child as it has a very high &#34;cute&#34; factor
B0084HJE0S|3.0|Ok - there wasnt enough detail for the project I had in mind, but gave me a start in my knowledge base.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|Overall the storyline was lacking it did not flow and seemed as if the many stories were cobbled together to make a looooonnng movie.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|every time I try to play the game it crashes.<br />tried several times to get it to work<br />there's money I'll never see again
B006LSZECO|5.0|this book takes your sympathies up and down the spectrum as you try to figure out if Amy is a wronged angel or a devious devil.
B00846WWVM|1.0|some of the levels are a little hard, the fires spread too quickly to figure out where to shoot the water
B0030Y11O2|4.0|This &#34;Capitalism&#34; is another good story of how middle class population in USA as well as all countries around the world are suffering under the concept of world best economic system&#34; Capitalism&#34;.  With exception of few countries where their leaders understand the handicap of middle class to access to basic needs in life such as education, medical care, jobs or social security and focus their attention to narrow the gap between the &#34;have&#34; and the &#34;have not&#34;.  Ironically , in countries where they are classified as &#34;undemocratic&#34; or &#34;socialism&#34; like Cuba or China, the middle class are more hopeful in education, medical aids and security in life comparing with great and wealthy USA where capitalism is at its peak, that a huge group of underprivileged citizen were left out in the cold without access to basic health care.  Fortunately, with the new leadership, equality and fairness in society in US is being fixed.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Somehow this movie seemed thrown together.. The storyline bounced around, great visual effects but overall disappointing... Not sure the sequel will be worth the effort.
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|Bloom is one of my favorites for 2012 and beyond. This is truly a great album. I'll keep an eye and ear on Beach House from here on out.
B003Y2BMVC|5.0|All to often the boys on the classroom groan at Disney movies with the fear there could be a princess popping out at any moment. They were hooked from the beginning!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|What do you do when the kids are away, and you actually have a weekend with your spouse to actually veg out for the first time in forever? Ya grab a season box like this one, make a pile of pocorn and snacks, and drop in your surround sound DVD player! I don't care for the homosexual aspect of the series, but the rest of it was pretty entertaining. Good for a weekend goof.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is very helpful to me.<br />I now can store all my stories, diaries, and info on my Kindle Fire.<br />This app does not forse close.<br />It does not glich.<br />It works just fine.<br />My only request is that it should save my data if app was deleted.<br />A few days ago, my 3 old  brother got ahold of my kindle and deleted this app.After I reinstalled, i found out that all my data was lost!<br />Please fix that, DroidVeda!
B008CP93S0|4.0|Not bad but gross nudity  other than that i enjoyed the humor and the actors were all great :) good cast!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno Mars. I'm a new fan after watching his live performances. He loves what he does and is dedicated. Cant hate that at all. Great album, catchy songs and attention grabbing lyrics. Much better than JT and his whatever experience. Just sayin'...
B001974DG0|5.0|This was a very entertaining and well written book. I have only read a couple fo Dean Koontz books and am glad I decided to download this one. Very enjoyable!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the 'best' James Bond movie to date! Action, drama, beautiful women; and a great story line. And who could forget the excellent Oscar winning theme song!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Some of the script was corny, but I guess that's what you get for watching a comic book movie. Parts of it are gory violence.  I liked the visuals and the violence.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|cool game a lot like rollercoaster rush but you don't stay on the tracks<br />you earn coins to unlock new characters that do different things
B009KEN87O|5.0|Really fun game to pass the time. Simple to play and still challenging. I would recommend this game for anyone.
B00846REIS|4.0|I laughed, I cried, suffered and enjoyed this book. A love story with many twists and turns. I can not wait to read the next
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great story...love the Philadelphia Eagle fan aspect and especially love the love story aspect!!! The discipline in dance is a great focus for the two main characters who meet each other at a time they are both wounded emotionally.
B0013527I4|5.0|The DVD set arrived well within the promised delivery date. It was in new condition as advertised. What can you say, the Muppets are always funny, great for all ages!
0446547646|4.0|Again, typically Sparks. But perfect for a long plane trip. A nice little romance with a few twists and turns. I rated it 4 stars. It did the job.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Forget this crap they are calling Lynyrd Skynrd these days. Lynyrd Skynyrd was/is and will always be Ronnie Van Zant. When he died on October 20, 1977 with new songwriting soulmate Steve Gaines ( whose debut is on this album) the band died. If you were a rock and roll guitar player growing up in the 70's, chances are you owned this album. All the Skynyrd hits up until that point are here. Plus three covers of songs that Ronnie Van Zant didn't write. \\"T for Texas\\", \\"Call me the breeze\\"( Steve Gaines Strat Fills are amazing) and \\"Crossroads\\" their tribute to \\"THE BEST BAND EVER LIVE\\" according to RVZ: CREAM.  Buy it and enjoy it. This was Rock and Roll.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love the story, with its twists and turns, with their characters, each more complicated than the other, to make the story more complicated every time.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I rented it because I never cared about historical events in school. Now I have interest and time - this movie requires a bit of background knowledge of  congress  and House of Rep. etc. and the roles they play. Abe's message is pretty clear through out the movie. I'm sure it could have been streamlined a bit and had the same message.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Great! You can not beat this version. The best actors. The best acting. It is better than the new version.
0316096199|5.0|This woman can really write. Lucky is a memoir of the author's rape when she was just a Freshman in college. This autobiography shines in the face of a terrible adversity. Sebold's style of writing takes you through the events actually bringing you along with her but without the sentimentality that many writers would bring to a memoir such as this. I found it to be brilliantly written and wish that I had read The Lovely Bones before reading this but I know that anything written by this author will be a mind blower! I highly recommend this book and rated it a 5 star read.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I bought this because Robin Hobb, whose books I enjoy greatly, recommended it.  I was not disappointed.  The world is new and refreshing, and you quickly grow to have affection for the protagonist.  But what I really love about it is that the author actually crafts language.  There are portions of this book that are truly poetic.  I can't wait for the third book, and I'll be bummed to see the story end so soon.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Captivating storyline that takes you back to a bigone era with character traits that would not be amiss in today's society!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I don't usually go for books like this, but after reading some of the reviews I figured I would give it a shot. It was absolutely fantastic. The only complaint I would have is that a few parts do drag a bit and I found it hard to get through them. Overall a great read though.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Its so interactive! I love dinosaurs and this is my kinda game! This is the best app that i have ever gotten on my device
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great and does what it should. can have tone of alarms and settings. great for free too. buy it
006117758X|5.0|My first exposure to Bukowski and I was not disappointed.  Original and well written, he really pulls you into his character.  Great read.
B00BF2RTO2|3.0|Sadly, he lost that skill some time within the last 20 years.<br /><br />\\"Maiden England\\" (which is now called \\"Maiden England '88\\") has been through some strange iterations through the years. Originally released on VHS tape, there was a rare collector's version that was accompanied with a 2 CD set of the concert as well. I was an original owner of the VHS tape, and longed for a DVD conversion since the mid 1990s, or at least a re-release of the CDs. While not my favorite Iron Maiden concert (reasons stated below), the setlist was near perfect (except for a glaring lack of Powerslave songs...), the live stage was entertaining, and for me, this was Iron Maiden's last great tour before excellent songwriting took a back seat to simplistic styles, and the engaging concerts were replaced with on-stage gratuitous shenanigans in the form of Janick Gers. Iron Maiden today is a shallow reflection of what it was from '82 - '88, and this video captures the zenith of that \\"golden era.\\"<br /><br />I can't help but compare this concert to its official predecessor, \\"Live After Death.\\" Every lover of heavy metal ought to own \\"Live After Death,\\" as it is in my opinion not only Iron Maiden's greatest live concert in terms of setlist, and also the most polished, well-produced live recording the band has ever released (yes, I've heard and own them them all in glistening lossless audio), but also one of the best live heavy metal albums in existence, from any metal band. (And for me, live metal albums nearly always sound horrible compared to their well-produced, studio counterparts). Upon comparing this concert to \\"Live After Death,\\" it falls short in a few, minor places. First, the overall sound of the concert isn't quite up to snuff. For me, the guitar overdrive has always sounded \\"softer\\" than those on Live After Death, or perhaps somewhat less distinguished. Moreover, Steve Harris' bass guitar has an overbearing \\"tinny\\" sound to it, which is his trademark in some respect, but not tothis extent. Still, it doesn't entirely distract from the sound of the concert, unlike Geddy Lee's bass did for \\"Rush in Rio,\\" which was a bass guitar production disaster. Next, Bruce Dickinson's vocals were off on some of these songs. Honest fans of the band have written elsewhere that this is due to the heavy touring the band had endured up to this point, so perhaps that's what I'm hearing. But he sings out of key in a few places (parts of \\"Moonchild\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\" especially), where his voice slips here and there. He also seems to have lost some of his screech, which was more prominent on the studio versions, and more heavily utilized on Live After Death (cf. the ending of \\"Flight of Icarus\\"). I will admit, however, that it is especially cool to see and hear the encore songs that were trimmed from the original release due to the time constraints of the VHS format. (Until now, outside of the original collector's edition, lossless audio of some of these songs were only available as rare b-sides to the various singles from the \\"Seventh Son of of a Seventh Son\\" album, or as the bonus disc from the now out-of-print Castle Records 2-disc version of the studio album. By the way, if you can find any of the Castle Records releases of the band's studio albums, buy them. The sound quality is vastly superior to today's overly clipped/compressed \\"remasters,\\" which in my opinion sound absolutely terrible).<br /><br />Lastly, my final comment is deserving of its own paragraph. Steve Harris, the band's bassist (and founder, and \\"front-man\\"), has taken it upon himself to edit most of the band's official concert videos. While the audio of these concerts stands on its own, the video editing has gradually degraded over time. Currently, Steve's style is to give the viewer about 1 to 1.5 seconds of footage before switching to the next 1 to 1.5 seconds of footage, never really giving the viewer a chance to see what is going on. There are also fewer wide shots, which is odd given that Iron Maiden is probably the only mainstream heavy metal band that has FOUR active guitarists (3 rhythm/lead guitarists, and 1 bassist), and therefore A LOT of stage presence. Maiden England '88 represents the last decent editing job Steve Harris produced before his seizure-inducing hack-and-slice editing jobs of the last 20 years' worth of concert releases. What I'm saying is that this concert is enjoyable from the standpoint of video editing, but keep in mind that Steve Harris' video editing quality stops here and hasn't returned.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I loved the first season, was mistreated by the second and have fallen out of love with the series by this season.
0345803493|1.0|What! That's it?  Darker? Darker than what?  I don't know.  I didn't read erotica until the best-seller status turned me to this book series. Turned is the word.  My stomach did turn a bit as I read an uninteresting book, page after page.  There were no plot twists to hold my attention, and between reading other more interesting books, it took me six months to finally turn the last page.<br /><br />I finished it to find out whether there would be a plot turn to hold my attention. There were none.  Maybe the stalking action would be resolved in an interesting way.  It wasn't.  Then maybe there was a purpose to the episode with the helicopter - not to give away any spoilers to the handful of people who wanted to read this story but haven't yet, or weren't old enough to be allowed to until now.  But, you guessed it, there wasn't.  Perhaps, the holier-than-holy Ana would fall off her pedestal and prove no great guns as a CEO at the age of 22 or is it 23 now?  No, that didn't happen either.  Let's face it; Christian Grey and his love, Anastasia, are perfect.  Maybe that is why the populace seems to love them so much.  I tend to love more those people - real or fictitious - who have a few flaws such as I do.  Of course, a perfect person wouldn't have written a critical review as this one.<br /><br />I also prefer to read fiction that goes in unexpected places.  Read any book published by Text Publishing for that. I'm going back to my latest interesting read now - and it isn't the third book in the Fifty Shades series.  Not yet anyway.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|I only recently came across Steven Wilson in the form of No-Man and then his solo works. This third installment in his solo career shows how he has progressed and matured in his music.This is a beautifully crafted album. Whether you like 70's progressive rock or today's sounds, you won't be disappointed with this album.( Porcupine Tree it ain't).
B004ODLUGM|5.0|great movie for kids and adults alike.  Follows the book exactly. If you like the Gruffalo story you will love this movie
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Do you think lightweights like Taylor Swiftless and Beiber and even Adele will be around in 50 years?  No way!!!  There is a reason he is still around and strong as ever because those old guys from the 60's who are now in their 60's still make the best music like Brian Wilson, and Townsend and Macca and Neil Young, for example, are true artists that wrote the book......
B0024CEY36|4.0|What's to say.  I'm a Follet fan.  Gives anarchy a better reputation -- better than it deserves, but one must
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Kept you interested through out. I have now read through all these books and really enjoyed them. Highly recommend reading.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read and went along with the movie pretty close! A lot more details in the book, so if you have only seen the movie, you should read the book.
0375758992|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was a true story, and the writer's style was wonderful!  She developed an understanding of all of the people, and their living conditions, and turmoils and love for their country.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Well paced, fantastic location and world that had just enough mystery left in it. Great anti-hero and co-horts.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of fantasy sagas. This will be one to keep up with!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy has predicted our future (now present) with uncanny accuracy.  Fortunately our DOD still has a few trick up the sleeve that the even Clancy does not know about.  Probably be discussed in his next book.
B004QSQMKE|4.0|I bought this purely for the nostalgia; this is one of those fantasy movies that every person ought to see. Also, every child deserves to be traumatized by Tim Curry at least once in their life, and this is a really good way to accomplish that.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Chock full of such interesting scenes of such &#34;different&#34; qualities, the author causes you to keep turning the pages.  At the end, I kept wondering about human nature, and why we do what we do, anyway.  It was an interesting read, although, honestly, I don't feel compelled to continue reading through to the end of the trilogy.
0061928356|5.0|I enjoyed the character development, as it told the two stories of the daughter's new family in America, as well as her original family in India.<br />  The author helped the reader to empathize with the characters in the book, and made the reader anxious to see how the story develops.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|How can beat the awesome music? With some great clips. It's here and, don't forget the extra features for additional insight and, and, and more music.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Storyline was interesting and original. The graphics were excellent and very cool and colorful. I would definitely try other G5 games.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I hadn't ever heard of these guys until just recently, so I can't say whether or not their music has declined; all I know is that I love this cd. Their sound is just wonderful.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|So I've owned (and discarded) three previous SD DVD editions of this film (one of my all-time favorites) when I finally settled on the \\"Ultimate Trilogy\\" BD Release of 25Oct2011 (UPC: 025192179143). It had *very* good PQ, I thought (I just tossed disks 2 & 3...).<br /><br />But then I see a \\"...new, digitally restored\\" Jurassic Park (\\"Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy + Ultraviolet\\" [whatever that is...]) dated 26 March 2013 w/UPC: 025192179143... (Just the first film, fortunately...)<br /><br />As far as I can tell this release is a 4K scan of \\"Jurassic Park\\" (1993). Subjectively, it has an order of magnitude better PQ then that two-year-old 3-disk BD release.<br /><br />If you're wondering whether to take the plunge - Yet Again... Universal should be explicit about this (if it is, in fact, so); they'd probably sell a lot more copies. I don't plan to buy any more.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I couldn't watch the entire movie - I was sickened by the little bit I saw. I was already a most of the time vegetarian. I am now full vegetarian.
B000I9W08I|5.0|I greatly enjoy musicals, and this is one of the best.  The young Barbara Streisand looks like the role was made for her, even given that several other great ladies (e.g. Carole Channing) performed so laudedly on stage.<br /><br />The Dancing was so great, but who knew Gene Kelly would be such a fantastic dance director.<br /><br />When I replay my DVD, :This IS America keeps popping off in my head.  Well, Americanica.  Sweet better days than today.

B002APU580|5.0|I loved this adaptation of the classic. Truthfully, after seeing this version I began to look more seriously at MacFayden as an actor. He's a big guy who pulls off the tender loving man thing...we all wanna love that on the big screen.
0790729393|5.0|I enjoyed the movie but I had to read this book.  It has turned out to be great.  Highly recommend it.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have yet to see this movie, but if the movie is anything like the book then it's a must see. This book opens your heart. You instantly connect to Pat Peoples by the authors narration. Excellent read....
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I had the HD-DVD version of this and was waiting/hoping it would eventually be released on BluRay as this concert is so good it was the only reason I was hanging on to the HD-DVD player.<br /><br />The sound quality of the BluRay is amazing with the 5.1 mixing being my favorite.  It like being center stage.<br /><br />They play a mix of songs spanning their entire career and is definitely worth adding to your collection
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool because it's addicting and fun! It was going to be the best thing! Until survivalcraft came in!

0062082353|5.0|As an Ex-military sniper, Chris was well known to us during many engagements in Iraq. He was a humble man that saved countless American lives by doing the job he was made for. This man is a hero that not only touched the lives of the souls he saved, but also the future unborn generations of their descendants. If anyone thinks it's an easy thing to do by taking a life and seeing that light vanish in a split second then you are wrong! Somehow Chris was able to put aside the horror of war and help those that fell victim of the sights, sounds and smells that the tragedy of war brings. It was a sad day when I learned that his life was cut short by one of those souls he was trying to help. May God watch over his family and may the future generations of children that still have their fathers because of the bravery of this man appreciate the gift they have been given. Rest in Peace Brother! The only easy day was yesterday....
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This book is extremely well written, organized and very practical, whether you're interested in selling a product, service, candidate or yourself. It is worth getting just for the chapter on Clarity in \\"selling\\" alone.

B00BHMETKC|1.0|Really???  That was so boring!  Hollywood patting itself on the back...can't believe that won best film.  Life of Pi/Lincoln by a mile!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It was something unlike any story I'd read before.  It really was the kind of gritty experience you'd expect for a poor sap trying to survive on guts, imagination, determination and bravery.  Spoiler alert - the only thing I found disappointing was the large storm that seems to have just ceased to be a problem.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|I had a feeling I would enjoy this documentary, but I had no idea how much.  It was very well put together and the story was so unique and touching.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!

B003UYV08E|2.0|I am not sure whose idea the opening scene was..probably Mickey Rourke..the realism, unrenovated Russian poverty scene was dark, realistic and gut wrenching. Hollywood rarelu presents reality. There it was--in a comic book movie. But somewhere through the film--at around 40 minutes in..they changed tones and turned it into a simple good guy-bad guy film with a typical Hollywood ending. It seems many hands were in the mix of the script --Downey, Rourke, and the writers and Director. too many hands equal an uneven film with too many fragmented scenes that don;t hold together. By the itme the film switched gears from anything eye-opening or interesting it turned into a typical Hollywood ending. Sloppy, forgetable , predictable. Only the first ten minutes of real life russian poverty give it any socially redeeming quality.

0446572985|5.0|This is perhaps Baldacci's finest work. It catches the reader from the very beginning with likeable assassin Robie who stays true to his training, yet endears himself to the reader with a care for others that makes him seem human yet doesn't detract from the killer instinct or personality necessary to be successful at his profession. The plot twists and turns keep you guessing and involved to the very last page. Bravo, Baldacci!
B00000JLWW|5.0|I like Leonardo and the story is suspenseful as it tells the story of love across class lines - sacrificial love.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I wondered what all the groupies were crazy about, so we decided to check the first episode and now we're hooked too.  I love the disfunctional family feel of the crew and they aren't trying so hard to be Star Wars.

B009LGO88E|5.0|When I upgraded to the 3DS XL, the original Circle Pad Pro became a stylish paperweight in my office.<br /><br />Enter the Circle Pad Pro 3DS XL/LL! This updated version of the CPP works fantastically! It has the same function as the orginal CPP: adding a second analog pad, and two shoulder buttons. The LZ button sits just behind the 3DS XLs L button and the RZ sits behind the CPPs R button (it is used instead of the 3DS R button, which would be out of reach with the extra length of the CPP). The point of all this is to make games like Monster Hunter, Resident Evil: Revelations, and Metal Gear Solid 3D play much more like their console brethren. Though this is a Japanese product, it work perfectly with my North American 3DS XL. It does make the console bigger, but I found it comfortable to hold, even during marathon Monster Hunts. If you found that the original 3DS was too small, and the 3DS XL fit in your hands better, you will probably not mind the extra bulk. CPP XL has a curved back which makes it much more comfortable to grip. You can plug in the power cord, adjust the volume, and put in headphones without removing the CPP XL. However you do have to take the 3DS out to change game cards or access the stylus. Taking the system out is a breeze anyway. There are rubber bumpers that keep it secure without bolts or latches of any kind (though I wouldn't suggest holding upside down). You just push the system in and roll!<br /><br />If you are a big Monster Hunter fan and plan on putting some serious time into MH3U...get this now!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The characters continue tp be well defined, yet an air of mystery continues to follow them.  Great series. The story line is intreaguing.
B004TI5N38|4.0|This kept me interested right to the end.  Didn't think the ending would be what it was.  Definitely will read more of this author.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|The movie is everything I had heard about it.  The acting is superb.  You actually believe that Daniel Day-Lewis IS Lincoln.  The cinematography is magnificent..<br />The pacing of the movie is very slow.  I believe it would have won more awards if it hadn't been so long.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I am lost for words about this game. Its like it makes you have an emotional connection to the game and reality and in the end and it makes you think about values like friendship. Its both addictive in terms of gameplay and its heartwarming at the same time which is why its really worth the money invested.<br /><br />I really do feel that no other games can make a human connection as compared to this because the story line is just that marvelous.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AWESOME series, good job AMC!!!! Didn't think I would even like the show, but my grand daughter got me into the show and now I'm hooked. This series rates right up there with the best ones I've ever seen!

0618918248|1.0|After hearing much about this book, I decided to take a look for myself.  At first I skipped about and then later made a more deliberate effort at reading the whole argument.  As a theist, I was most disappointed in Dawkins' treatment of arguments for God.  He gave no evidence of really understanding the philosophical underpinnings of Aquinas' arguments, for instance.  He spends only a few pages on these arguments and profoundly misunderstands them.  In some reviews people focus on Dawkins' failure to understand Scripture and, some arguing, that understanding Scripture is unnecessary for his argument.  Since Dawkins speaks very harshly about the biblical notion of God, I fail to see how criticizing his ignorance of the Bible is not relevant.  Given his stature as a prestigious university professor, the standards of scholarly research in this work are far below what Dawkins owes his readers.  As these reviews show, those who already agree with Dawkins will be delighted by the book while those who are unconvinced or who disagree will find more to offend, annoy and disappoint than anything else.

1451624468|1.0|When this book actually addressed the subject-matter indicated by the title, it was profoundly disappointing.  The author, for instance, speculates on Aquinas' (and others') understanding of &#34;nothing,&#34; suggesting that they probably meant &#34;empty space&#34; or something like it when they spoke of &#34;nothing.&#34;  In other words, Krauss tries to get us to read his book based on the clam that he is going to address the question of &#34;why there is something rather than nothing&#34; but, then, defines &#34;nothing&#34; as &#34;something,&#34; and has the audacity to claim that Aquinas and other agreed with him!  Not only is Krauss' claim about Aquinas false (Aquinas sees &#34;nothing&#34; as the absence of being altogether, hence it is a negation of being and not a &#34;thing&#34;), something he could have discovered rather easily if he had taken time to investigate it, but he leaves us without an answer to the question on the cover of his book by a sleight of hand move by changing the meaning of the word &#34;nothing.&#34;  Once he gives &#34;reality&#34; to nothing he can then go on to speak of more reality coming from that &#34;nothing&#34; (which is really something and therefore able to serve as a substrate for other things).
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked this book because of the insight you get to a freshman in high school, the want of teenagers to feel accepted, family issues, drugs in high school.  It was a fast and easy read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is an amazing journey.. filled with so many heartfelt emotional ups and downs. I have to admit I bought the book because when I saw the preview for the movie and saw that my fave actor was in it I had to read it. I wish I had known about this book sooner as its  a great read. I highly recommended this book.

I would give it five stars except it comes with no instructions, so you'll need to google for some instructions on how to use it if you don't know.  On the other hand, that's better than instructions written in Engrish.

B00BHU2A7I|3.0|\\"Hitchcock\\", The Movie, is about a small part of the famous director's life, between the successful release of \\"North By Northwest\\" and the release of \\"Psycho\\"; detailing how he came to make the latter, and what happened along the way.  The movie opens and closes with Anthony Hopkins in his eponymous role, but taken from the TV show Alfred Hitchcock hosted, introducing both the movie \\"Hitchcock\\" and it's focus on \\"Psycho\\" and tying up loose ends at the finish.  In this aspect of Alfred Hitchcock, Hopkins is breaking the fourth wall, but only to a point.  Along the way, the \\"actual\\" serial killer (who inspired the book and then the movie, \\"Psycho\\") appears as a hallucinated muse who guides Hitchcock along in the filming, although the movie is so sloppy in drawing boundaries, very often it appears that Hitchcock was harboring a mass killer.<br /><br />This is no more of a biography of Alfred Hitchcock than \\"The Master\\" was a biography of L. Ron Hubbard, or Scientology.  But the latter was a much more polished work, and far better done.  As a piece of cinematography, alone, this film is an insult to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, but at least it gives some long overdue public credit to Hitchcock's apparently long suffering wife, Alma.  And it's entertaining, if nothing else.<br /><br />When it comes to portraying famous people some of us remember remember seeing alive,  Anthony Hopkins is far less convincing as Hitchcock than Meryl Streep was as Julia Child.  His fat suit isn't proportioned correctly, so Hopkins holds his arms out to his sides; tilts his head back, and half-purses his lips to impose an effect that isn't quite successful.  The camera looking up from waist level helps, somewhat, but how many people are filmed from the waist, looking up?  Any quick watch of Julia Child's PBS cooking show illustrates there's a big gap between her reality and Meryl Streep's portrayal, but Streep captured her essence with far less effort than Hopkins, thus Hopkins' antics end up deflating rather than inflating his character.<br /><br />As far as the other characters go, Jessica Biel was even less successful at portraying Vera Miles than Hopkins was in playing Hitchcock, but James D'Arcy pretty much nails Anthony Perkins.<br /><br />So, like a lot of films these days, you just have to go in expecting entertainment, in this case a Hitchcock themed entertainment, and not put too much into it, or try to get too much out of it.  It's fairly decent fresh popcorn, not fine dining.  I'll probably watch it again, but renting it to stream, not buying it.up deflating rather than inflating his character.<br /><br />As far as the other characters go, Jessica Biel was even less successful at portraying Vera Miles than Hopkins was in playing Hitchcock, but James D'Arcy pretty much nails Anthony Perkins.<br /><br />So, like a lot of films these days, you just have to go in expecting entertainment, in this case a Hitchcock themed entertainment, and not put too much into it, or try to get too much out of it.

B003U0AHBO|5.0|I love this movie.  Of all the Robin Hood movies I have seen, I think this one most closely depicts life in those times.  Not to say it is totally accurate.  The real Robin Hood is a fictional character in the year 1200 AD.  There is some evidence that suggests he was real, but no one knows exactly who he might have been.  The story has been embelished throughout history and characters have been added along the way.  Maid Marion was not included until much later on.  In this, the Russell Crowe edition, a strong attempt was made to accurately describe the clothing of the period as well as the villiage architecture.  Crowe plays a credible role as Robin and the other characters play complimentary parts.  The key to this movie is the Loxley sword.  That seems to be what ties the whole story together.  The ending, I fear, seems concocted and to me departs from rational thinking.  The battle with the French on the beach  where Marion participates as a combatant, is the most unlikely.  However, the movie is meant to be entertainment and there little real history to contradict.  Thus I will not subtract any stars for that.  All in all, it's a most enjoyable movie and I have watched it several times.
B00006AW63|5.0|My family I love watching 101 Dalmatians movie and would want other people out there to watch with family and friends.

B002O3Z50Q|5.0|This movie is a sprawling epoch from ancient Greece and Turkey. This is Brad Pitt at his best, who got really pumped up for the part.  Eric Bana plays a great supporting role as Hector, tamer of horses, and the rest of the cast, from Peter O'toole as King Priam on down play superb roles too. The battle scenes are very realistic.  Pitt shows great athletic skill in his fight with Hector and the trojans. Taken from the pages of Homer's Iliad, the story dates back 33 centuries when Helen, Diane Kruger, a Spartan queen becomes abducted by Paris, Orlando Bloom, a trojan prince.  King Agamemnon, Brendan Gleeson, agrees to help his brother, Menelaus, Helen's husband, to get her back.  His real motive, however, is to take Troy and control the Aegean Sea.  Unable to defeat troy's defences, the Greeks resort to trickery and employ a giant hollow horse to gain admittance to the city.  Troy was actually a real city and was rediscovered in the late 1800s by an archaeologist named Heinrick Schlieman.  The entire movie from beginning to end is awesome and breathtaking.  A real piece of ancient history.  I have watched it uncountable times.
B002TUU4EG|2.0|My review is in regards to the MOVIE PLUS SHOPPING BAG distribution.  First, I will say I loved the movie and in fact have ended up with I believe 4 copies of it.  The release of the movie with the shopping bag was one I coveted but could not bring myself to buy at the original price when it was first offered.  SO, I PUT IT OFF.  I rechecked the item off and on and finally it was offered for $14.99 so I ordered it.  I DON'T KNOW IF THE ORIGINAL OFFER INCLUDED A DECENT QUALITY SHOPPING BAG BUT I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE BAG I RECEIVED at the less expensive price.  The bag was in its own plastic see through package affixed inside a second see through package along with the DVD.  On opening my newly acquired purchase, excited to see my new SHOPPING BAG I was immediately disappointed.  The purchase even at the reduced price, in my estimation, was not a good one. DESCRIPTION:  the bag is square in shape when folded closed and it opens into one that measures 12\\" in height, 12\\" in width and 4\\" in depth at the opening, the same 4\\" all the way down the inside.  The two carry straps add an additional 9\\" to the overall length. What the material is I haven't a clue as there is no tag of any kind that I can discover and I turned it inside out looking.  The material is a close weave and might pass for a light weight canvas cloth, somewhat shiny so maybe it's a nylon.  There is no aromatic smell so no clue to the fabric via the nose.  It's actual weight might be about as much as a pot holder.  It is sewn well, I'll give it that much positive comment.  It is nicely seamed so without any real info I would say it couldn't have been made in the USA but somewhere in Asia where most of our sewing is now done AND I'M NOT LAUGHING.  If your intent is to use the bag for grocery shopping, I would line it first with two cuts of cardboard for strength. QUANTITY EXAMPLE thinking of breakfast: it could carry possibly 5 nice oranges on the bottom and next a dozen eggs then a loaf of bread, FOUR 1#bacon slabs (THREE FOR THE FREEZER) on either side to reinforce them for carrying and maybe a few more very small items. I will use it for packing picnic sandwiches and chips.  \\"CLASSY\\" is not a word I can use for this bag but if you want to spend your money on the movie WITH THE SHOPPING BAG, and I would not purchase the bag for more than a dollar at a garage sale, I am arming you with the details of the item beforehand.  Maybe the quality was there when the combination was first offered ???  GIFT GIVING, THE MOVIE will make a wonderful gift, it's the part of this combination purchase worth every penny of the spending.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Definately not vintage Stephen King and not his best work in my opinion,but still worth reading .A bit slow in spots
0812993357|3.0|Grace Coddington, a British model turned fashion stylist/editor extraordinaire, has crafted a memoir whose best feature is its social history from the 1950'2 and 1960's. Coddington knew anyone who was anyone in the incestous world of fashion, and the parts about her life as a model in both England and France are delightful, as is her account of her early life in a remote corner of Wales. The book's black and white photographs are fascinating and her personal ilustrations--doodles, really--are charming.<br /><br />While the early part of the book is honest and reveals Coddington's great love for fine fashion photography, the book takes a sour turn when the author movies to New York City to work with Calvin Klein--a job for which she's not especially suited--and eventually, Anna Wintour at American VOGUE. While Coddington's loyalty to Wintour is to be respected, this part of the book isn't much fun, and devolves into a hodgepodge of name-dropping.<br /><br />This is a book true fashionistas will enjoy.
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|don't buy this game worst. it wouldn't let me move around. never ever get this game. the worst out of all games here really stupid game
B004I654WQ|5.0|I got a great deal for this two pack. DVD for kids and Blu-ray for adults to maintain. Great price and kids love this movie
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I love this series, and this is a truly epic start to the Hobbit trilogy!  Peter Jackson as done it again!
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I have all temple runs and love them all except this one. I started to play today and it wouldn't jump or do anything. It also kept freezing. It gets really annoying. I thought it would be a fun game to have but not now.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|With this many positive rewies I really expect so much more of this book. The main male character is the pefect hero, to perfect to be just a teenager and with this kind of plot ( which I didn't mind) the resolution of all at the end was to simple.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|not liking the fact if you die you start from the beginning of the game all over again.  should have better save features
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Wonderful animation of the children's book with delightful narration by Helen Bonham Carter.  The other actors bring the voices of each animal to life - giving them just the right amount of  personality. Great movie!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app! it makes you feel like you actually own the restaurant. 5 stars for this app!!! :-)
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Words are wind, George, and you seem to like yours more than most. A ramble worthy of any mad Targaryen. Just finish the books, George.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is great but it didn't reach the update that was released on Thursday give it to us Tomorrow or Monday.
0679805273|4.0|I LOVE the book, but its paper cover came with a 1-1/2 inch tear.  Don't understand why they'd ship a book with a torn cover.  I should have returned it immediately, but I didn't bother. So I will have to buy another copy to give to my grandson who graduates from high school in May.  Will go to the local Barnes and Noble this time.
B008Y73940|5.0|Don't miss a minute or you'll miss the whole movie. Mathew reminds me of a classic Sherlock Holmes. He is always ahead of the game and keeps you on the edge of your seat. A real surprise ending!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love this book is amazing the plot is beautiful honestly I read it the entire book like in 6 hours. I love it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app, but just as I was getting thevhang of it the game wouldn't open.  When it does open, after a ten minute plus wait, my horse is usually miserable since I can only get on the app every few days due to this problem. Please fix!!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I've had it for a couple of months now, and I only have one complaint--it is a pretty horrible automatic watch, haha; but considering the price for an automatic watch, I shouldn't have expected much. It runs fast, and you notice it within a few days. At least I don't ever have to worry about batteries! That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, the watch is comfortable and is a great, simple-stylish everyday wrist-piece. If you don't like overwrought timepieces, as I do not, this is a good pick.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Owning Celebration Day will make the owners life complete. Every aspect of this package is perfect. You need not read any further reviews. It is time to buy it.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|I enjoyed watching this one with my son. It was alittle too violent for my liking,but it included a behind the scenes video blogs that covered a 12 year journey in the production of the hobbit and the dedication of the director, actors & crew on the lord of the rings connection.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The Hobbit film is a good complement to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, but it falls short in dramatic quality. The sets and scenes are well done and the acting is good. Yet, the story is slow in places. Author: D L Stephens
B002Z5FM74|5.0|I bought this to back up my photos and personnel info. And its really nice to know that my photos are backed up. Very easy to use and lets you get everything organized which is really helpful. I recommend this to anyone.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AMAZING!!!! A act of chivalry over the skies of war torn Germany,from a German fighter pilot to a heavily damaged B-17E. This isn't the Germany you thought it was.
076790592X|5.0|This book was better than what I heard. Very heartfelt story by Mitch albom. Was an igniter for mento start back to reading.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is an awesome movie!  I can hardly wait for the next two to come out!  So excited!  Everyone will love this!
B008220C56|1.0|only thing good about this movie was the costumes, it was overacted, badly done, no suprises,<br />the guy she gave up everything for was a creep and looked like a girl
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Lost some sleep trying to keep up with where the case was going.<br />Also was getting very upset with the FBI's interference too challenging Harry's investigation.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|this app keeps freezing up my kindle fire - I play it once then it freezes and I have to keep feasting my fire - total waste of my time!!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The storyline was ok, but the are a lot of typos. One part of the plot was confusing because I thought a few days had passed in the book, but apparently only a few hours had passed? It doesn't seem like it was edited vey well.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Perfect! My husband loved it for his birthday. I'll probably have to order another one when this one wears out!
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Wasn't what I expected but nonetheless a very interesting and entertaining movie. Money well spent, people should see this movie
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have only just heard of the Piano Guys and what a great find. They play their respective instruments superbly and they also get into what they are doing.  Buy this CD and enjoy it. Go on Youtube or whatever and watch their videos.  It is great entertainment. I would that they would make a video, for saie to watch them over and over again. If you go to view their videos, I recommend the Mission Impossible one and the Star Wars one.  I do hope that they make many more CDs, especially a Christmas one or two.  One thing is when you play this CD, have the bass up some. There is one song that has a kicking bass part in it.  I play this CD in my car and I wonder how many people hear it, cause I got it up LOUD.  Even if you are not into classical music, it is still a very great CD to listen too.  It is by no means stodgy or boring.  It is amazing on what these guys can do with music, with mainly a piano and a cello.  And they don't limit themselves to just classical. There are non-classical pieces as well.  The only bad thing about this CD is when it's finished, because you want to hear more and more of their music.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a great movie. I totally enjoyed it and the songs were great. The whole thing songs, acting and the actors are top of the line.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I got the game when it took up 460mb, then I saw that it only needed 26, so, I redownloaded it, now I lost all my progress because I didn't want to use it with facebook
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This games is the best I cant stop playing it! Its so much FUN! Its better than the first one.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I still don't understand why this movie was not done before LOR, but I am glad they finally did it. I think Freeman does a great job of portaying Bilbo Baggins.  I have only seen him in Sherlock and I think he does both parts well. The interesting thing is though McKellan is older, he plays a younger looking Gandalf (albeit not much younger). Some of the LOR characters do make an appearance in the movie, but you now have to get use to new ones.  I sort of missed not seeing Aragorn and the others, but they weren't relevant at the time of this story. There are some slow areas in the movie, where not a lot of action takes place, but it still was a good evening's entertainment.  But be warned. This is only one of two or three videos before the Hobbitt has been told.  So that may be the one let down of this video.  LOR was understandably made in three videos, because there are three books. But the Hobbitt is only one and maybe they could have extended the length of the film and maybe left out some less important stuff in order to tell the whole story in one video.  So now we have to wait until late this year or early next in order to get our fix.  But still this was a good appetizer and I recommend it highly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|WAAAHHHHH.....GRRRrrrrr did not want Merle to die........<br />the details in the show are incredible...allows you to enjoy...<br />AND makes you think....the symbolisms are just everywhere<br />in this series.<br />would give it 10 STARS.....
B0084B5TK8|4.0|No, it's not 'Interview with a Vampire' or 'Twilight' - this is THE original vampire story that brought not just the physical but psychological horror to Western culture.  Unlike the fast paced, rapid fire events and relationships that we find in modern thrillers, this work actually requires you to READ to follow the plot and events.  If I was teaching high school English (or even a college level course), this would be one of my picks!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is just like Mario bros only this game way better! You collect acorns and then you shoot them at a bug or snail.
B00122X6WY|5.0|I have only heard of Kraftwerk in the last couple of years, even though they are a comtemporay of one of my favorite groups, Tangerine Dream. Someone had been in my lab, while I was playing a TD cd and they mention that I might like Autobahn, which I did. So I started looking for other Kraftwek CDs and found some.  There was some misses, but Computer World was not one of them.  It is very dated, though. Those who have grown up with computers all over the place would probably miss the concept of this album, but I remember buying my first Texas Instrument scientific calculator for about $100 dollars, when calculators were just coming on the market. And who could forget RadShacks TRS computers?  When I got my TRS with 64k memory, I thought I had the power in my hands. Who would believe that you could use up 64k of memory?  So this is sort of the world that this CD is talking about.  One of the songs is talking about how great it is to have a pocket calculator!  The first song, Computer World, sort of gives the ominous thing about the use of computers to track people and money.  It mentions the FBI, Interpol, DeutschBanc, etc.  It is basically a good early electronics type musical album that is probably as good as Autobahn
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This game is adorable and fun. I would give it five stars if it wasn't for the following issues:<br /><br />There are not proper guides to help you in the game. There is a faq page in the gameloft site, but it doesn't cover key tasks that you need to know. This leads into the fact that customer support is extremely lacking. I put in a help request to get help in the game. My posts on the gameloft forum were ignored. They finally responded after several days. The game is also buggy. I put in a support request over two weeks ago and have again been ignored.<br /><br />I realize this is a free game. The currency in the game is INSANELY priced. An example is: The \\"bling\\" cost 99.99 for 2000. No that is not a typo. There are pets in the game that cost up to 1500 bling. That works out to be $75.00usd for one pet! There are other items in the game that are similarly priced. I find this ludicrous. I spent a minimal amount on bling when I first got the game. I will not spend another dime as long as I continue to be ignored and the in game currency is so high priced.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I've been playing this game for four months now. I've reached a point where there is nothing left for me to do in the game. I have several million (yes million!) coins and nothing to spend them on. The only houses left are \\"bling\\" items. There are a couple of pets left to buy with coin, but with no house to put them in, what is the point. I hope maybe they will add some coin items in the future. The game is really cute and I hate to just give it up.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I use this as a headphone amp when I watch movies late at night, and don't want to keep my family up.  (My sound bar doesn't have a headphone jack).  So... it's great for that.  It gives me a way to adjust volume, and the built in equalizers help a bit too.<br /><br />Caution though... this is not a high-fidelity headphone amp.  You get a bit of noise.  For my system I'm perfectly happy, but if you truly want great sound FiiO has some more expensive units that would work better.<br /><br />Totally happy with FiiO.

B0027BOL4G|3.0|I learned that you don't need to be a genious to see what we eat is &#34;killing us softly&#34;. You must see this DVD with your family and start to make changes. This DVD deserves 5 stars, but I'm disappointed with amazon; they offered this DVD with spanish subtitles<br />and sent me this one without any spanish subtitles! I CAN'T SHARE THIS dvd WITH ALL MY DEAR FAMILY.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Loved it, I<br /> expected some dumb short story but got a spine tingling story... great for my book report on a mystery book
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got the couch to 5,000 coins achievement but I didn't get the five thousand coins I deserve. It also freezes way too much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the best book I have read in a long time.  I keep finding myself measuring other books to it, and they all fall short.  Kept me going, hard to put down.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|Removed the ground loop hum from my computer audio system without any discernible effect on audio quality.  Make sure to pick us some small rubber feet for this, as it doesn't include any.
B000AP04NI|5.0|This item arrived in a short amount of time and it was exactly what I was hoping for.  The color and picture quality is above expectations.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved it, Coleen Hoover is a wonderful writer, she keeps you turning the page, so interesting and down to earth.  I absolutely loved it and recommended it to all my friends.
B0000WPADK|5.0|Excellent detail.  Generally I'm not a fan of Revell products, but this one is quite good.  Quite happy with the price as well!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This is another story about WWII with a different twist to it.  I enjoyed this as much as I did &#34;War Brides&#34; for different reasons and yet the same.  Let me explain, I really get tired of the WWII books that share the battles and the same stuff over and over again!  This story shares events from a young girls perspective and the courage, the trek she undertook, and what a perspective it was.  No spoiler here but how our minds work as young people is simple as hers was, I was sad for her and what she learned. I might read this again even if I know the end.
B0039YZPZ4|4.0|If you have A.D.D. This movie is not for you. I thoroughly enjoyed it but my roommate wasn't as impressed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is so amazing. I got so attached to the characters I cried when they did, hurt when they did, got mad when they did. I would read it a million times again and never get tired of it.
B004G600A4|4.0|This a great movie but it freezes up two or three time near the end of the movie why is that?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it, I use it daily and have no problems with it.  It is simple to bookmark, to change the settings for day or night, large or small print.  I do all the updates and some don't effect my iPhone 4.  I wish it gave a description of the book because sometimes I down load several and want to remember what they are about before choosing.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I like the spooky sounds! I like hunting for the hidden objects! Doesn't get any better. I do wish there were way more than 8 levels. Love it. Doing the review for the sequel. Hope it's just as spooky!
B007THA4FI|4.0|This was the only book I've read over the past few months that I could not put down.  It's a nasty expose of small town bickering, class snobbery, laced with a smidgen of scandal that Rowling explores to the detriment of the poor excuses for human beings that inhabit her fictional towns.  Hardly anyone is likable and you come away satisfied that some get their just desserts and dissatisfied others get off scott free.  The one character who one feels any affection is one who ends up being a catalyst that brings others back from the brink of downright petty treachery.  But the cost is too sad.<br /><br />This was a huge departure from the Harry Potter books.  Dowling is expert at drawing her characters but this time round she perhaps writes her characters too negatively for the book to be enjoyable.  It's a great study in human spite, jealousy and conniving but it's not a happy read, nor is it probably intended to be.
0743454537|5.0|I had seen the movie, before reading the book.  The movie does not follow the book at all.  It only follow the case.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This was a birthday present for my daughter. She loves the series but sometimes has to work when it is on, so I thought this would be te perfect gift for her. She loved it. Called me right away to let me know she got it. That's one of the great things Amazon offers,sending an item directly to another address. My daughter said it was in perfect condition and played great. She was very surprised so I know she will be watching the DVD a lot. She will probably get season two for Christmas.
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|The filmmaking style is very outdated. If I had known Bob Guccione was involved in its making, I'm sure I would  not have rented it. Nothing against Bob Guccione but his tastes and mine are not the same.
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|Through the years Depeche Mode has always tried something new intheir albums and it's always worked well, very well. This album is not the exception. Dave Gahan has proven himself a force to reckon with when it comes to his writing talents. LOVED THIS!!
B004UPANGM|3.0|Not that scary -- in story or direction.  Perhaps an okay movie for a long rainy day, when you don't mind dozing through it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was an excellent book series. I enjoyed the first two from start to finish. This one started out great, but then it got a little slow and stopped reading it for a little while. But I got back to it and it was awesome. It ended almost exactly how I wanted it to except for the loss of a few good people.  I recommend that everyone reads this book
0316044695|5.0|This is an engrossing, fascinating, and heart breaking personal account of the horrendous situation Luttrell and his SEAL teammates endured in the rugged Hindu Kush Mountains in northeast Afghanistan in the summer of 2005. Luttrell wrote the story because he wants the public to know his teammates as he knew them, and to understand the courage and dedication they exemplified, and who made the ultimate sacrifice.

B00821OX98|4.0|The protagonist, Tom Mason, played by Noah Wyle, is a father, grieving widower, and second in command for a group of civilians and fighters who are resisting a devastating invasion of aliens amid the rubble of what remains of society.  He is conflicted in trying to care for what is left of his family (3 sons) and doing his duty as leader.  I really enjoy the way the writers have meted out the information about the enemy.  Also the relationships in the show flesh out the characters nicely without feeling contrived or falling into just another soap opera.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... review  title is self explanitory ... ... ... ... .. great !!!
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Wow. How totally underwhelming.  A boring movie that used CGI and an overdone and overbearing score to try to keep you awake.  That said, much of the score was borrowed from LOTR and felt completely out of place.  Annoying even.<br /><br />Rent, don't buy.  You won't watch it more than once.
1603427244|4.0|My true review would be 3.5 stars. This book is laid out very well, photographed well, and written in a very straight forward way. It is easy to find what you want without reading a lot, so it works well as  a reference book. I like that it is small, so if I want to keep it in my knitting bag for a project I can. My two complaints, which hopefully can be addressed in a next addition are: 1) the combination a wire binding and glossy pages is both very squeaky, and pages are beginning to tear at binding after only a little use. This book is not going to last 2) the book is not comprehensive enough to be \\"the\\" reference. I still have to go through several books and magazines because I cannot trust that this volume fully covers the topic.

B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This is a great app. But the down side is that it gives you little time - like 15 min., agreed with the 5 star rater- Overall I have had little glitches and loads of fun. I only wish that the real app would cost less. Main point - Great app, fun to play, should get. Hope you found this helpful!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I found these characters more typical of life as we know it in this plot than FSoG, although I loved that trilogy!  This book had a bit more of a plot to it than the first book and a bit of mystery.  It will be interesting to see where the characters go in the next book.  I've pre-ordered it.

I am only sad that it has ended.. leaving me to search for the next fascinating and amazing science fiction series. Watch them in order or you will be completely lost.

1416936386|4.0|I am a fan of post-apocalyptic/dystopian novels and often find myself searching for the next enthralling story. While searching through lists of PA books, I happened across the Uglies, a YA novel by Scott Westerfeld. I had seen this series before and was interested, but I had just never picked it up. Now that I knew it was about a dystopia, I was dying to read it!<br /><br />Uglies starts in a city where a kid's 16th birthday is a big event- it is when a kid undergoes their surgery to become Pretty. Everyone wants to become Pretty so they can live in New Pretty Town, party all day, not worry about responsibilities and revel in their new Pretty selves. Well, maybe not everyone. Tally Youngblood misses her friend Peris who turned 16 and became Pretty months before she did. But now she has met a new friend, Shay, who teaches her to perfect her hoverboard riding, takes her to the Rusty Ruins (where they see our ancient cities as they deteriorate and mock our ravenous consumption of the world), and tells Tally of a place where kids go to escape the surgery- a place called the Smoke that is full of Uglies who fend for themselves and stay far away form the cities.<br /><br />When Shay runs away, the Specials (Cruel Pretties) tell Tally she must find Shay and lead the Specials to the Smoke or she won't get her surgery. Desperate to become Pretty and join Peris, Tally goes to the Smoke, but she doesn't find what she expected. The Smoke is a place where everyone works for their fair share, people are free from the petty lives of Pretties, and the Specials aren't watching their every move. Tally must make up her mind: should she betray David and the Smoke or remain in the one place where she finally felt alive and free?<br /><br />I have to say this novel was a little slow for me in the very beginning. All the descriptions of Tally and Pretty Town were interesting, but by no means gripping. The story didn't really pick up until half-way through when tally sets off for the Smoke. By this point, I was certainly hooked! The story does go quite quickly, and the premise is so interesting- a society where everyone is made to look the same in order to prevent racism and prejudice, but is really a ruse for the government to keep society \\"malleable\\". When the truth comes out, however, that the surgery changes their personality as much as their appearance, it is a fate worse than staying Ugly. I recommend this series for a kid who enjoyed Hunger Games. The language isn't overly mature or complex, the plot is very interesting, and it should grab a hold of any reader. Give it a chance and prepare to ask yourself which you'd rather be: a mindless Pretty or a Free-willed Ugly!e. By this point, I was certainly hooked! The story does go quite quickly, and the premise is so interesting- a society where everyone is made to look the same in order to prevent racism and prejudice, but is really a ruse for the government to keep society \\"malleable\\". When the truth comes out, however, that the surgery changes their personality as much as their appearance, it is a fate worse than staying Ugly. I recommend this series for a kid who enjoyed Hunger Games. The language isn't overly mature or complex, the plot is very interesting, and it should grab a hold of any reader. Give it a chance and prepare to ask yourself which you'd rather be: a mindless Pretty or a Free-willed Ugly!
B005K2YRVG|5.0|I've had a third gen Kindle for over 2 years and bought a cover like this but in a different size when I bought it.  I't been incredibly reliable.  I recently decided to buy a new Kindle Paperwhite  to replace my third gen and bought this case to go with it.  No disappointment.  The new one seems as solidly made and good a fit as the original.  Great case.
B00594XOZU|4.0|it keeps my son steven in contact with his bio dad with out having to aske to use the phone ...we put it on a tablet he got for xmas
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Maybe because I had low expectations, but I found this to be a surprising very good movie. Not for people who have to have everything that happens in a movie be realistic.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Good game. Enjoy playing it. Have easy levels as well some hard ones. Worth buying. Also comes with many different worlds.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I love reading book in sequence when there is a remarkable character for a series - but this one could be read in any order - first, last, or anywhere in between. Each Jack Reacher novel that I have read so far has been self-contained but I always want to know more about the character.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|First time I have downloaded a video to my kindle.  I am generally pleased with what I see. We shall see how this goes.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I bought this book for an airplane flight, it was very good. I liked that you never know until the end it Jacob is guilty or nor guilty. As a parent you can relate to the parents of Jacob in the book.
0062014536|3.0|Oh Miss Oliver.<br /><br />I expect more from someone with an MFA. You baited us with Delirium, a page turner, then gave us a less well written sequel Pandemonium and I ignored a few holes in that one because it was still decent but this last one, well let's just say, if I'd started with Requiem, I would never have read the series.<br /><br />The voice for Lena and Hana sounded too similar to one another for me to see them as truly separate.<br /><br />You know everyone was waiting to see the love triangle resolved. This isn't a short story where you can leave things up to the imagination and let the reader decide. Novels are not choose your own adventure, they are supposed to be of more substance than that. Speaking of substance, this book reminded me of going to a sandwich shop and having it stuffed with lettuce so that they don't have to give you very much of the real toppings.<br /><br />Very disappointing, unsatisfying and unfulfilling.<br /><br />I believe you are a talented writer but I think you just got lazy or ran out of time or need a new editor or maybe all of the above.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun I could.play it all day if you like this app you should get temple.run 2
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Covers my kindle fire perfectly =) purplr is my fav color. I like how I can use it without holding it. And when I'm done close it and put the band around it so my kid can't get into it.
B00006AUIG|4.0|Danvers State Mental Hospital could have starred in everything from ghosts to murder. The home of the first brain surgery to control patients. It was torn down to protect the COMMENWEALTH OF MASS. FROM LAW SIUTS THEY BUILT CONDOMINIUMS ON SITE STILL HALF EMPTY.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|A classic Disney movie that is needed to complete Tron Legacy. If you have one you need the other. For its time this movie was well done.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|it is one of the very best novels I've read in a long long while-----it was recommended to me by several friends-----it was a plot like no other I've ever read---and the writing was super good too
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is very good and fun! But there is just so much ads and takes forever to load on my Kindle Fire. You should get it bust just remember the ads and the loading problem.
030758836X|1.0|I was reading this for my book club.  I couldn't finish it.  It just went on, on and on.  I personally don't like it when a woman writes in first person as a man -- it just doesn't ring true.  The writing was lyrical and poetic but that did not add to the book; I think it was actually distracting.  I can't imagine how this was a best seller.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I thought that a Bourne movie without Bourne would not do but the producers and director did an excellent job of tying it all together in a nice neat package.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great history lesson, awesome movie. Well acted throughout, i never lost interest and will have to watch over and over.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|very good! good product! I enjoy listen the bee gees in the morning, love the different setting in the clock, I would like that the clock in the desk say the actual time.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|WOW. CAN I SAY THAT AGAIN? OK. WOW. THIS IS A BREATH  OF FRESH AIR FROM ALL THESE POP AND HIPHOP SONGS THAT PRETTY MUCH SAY EITHER THE SAME THING OR NOTHING AT ALL. SURE SOME OF IT ARE LOVE SONGS BUT THEY TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY. ITS ELEMENTAL, MAYBE EVEN PRIMAL. DEFINITELY AN UNDERLYING BUT STRONG CELTIC INFLUENCE. ALSO, SHE WROTE THESE SONGS AS WELL AS SINGING THEM. SO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE IS SINGING IS HER AND NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S WORDS. TWO WORDS. BUY IT.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Very well done! Reminds me of a modern day Roman Colosseum and the gladiators that participated in them. The challenge of life verses death and how to cope with each.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Really liked this movie. I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Wish it had said if the kids got their film chosen. I think they did\.
0375869026|5.0|This is such a heart touching book. I felt a connection to August because while reading his story, I remembered being bullied as a kid. This book makes you grateful for everything you have. I cried at some parts and laughed at others. I would recommended this book to anyone! Simply amazing.
B000007MVL|4.0|ADMITTEDLY, I LIKED HER LATER STUFF BETTER. STILL,IT IS SOMETHING. SINCE I REDISCOVERED HER ON YOU TUBE, I APPRECIATE HER EARLIER SONGS A LITTLE BIT MORE. OF COURSE OVER THE YEARS SHE HAS EVOLVED CREATIVELY OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T BE KATE BUSH. STILL UNLESS YOU ARE A HARD CORE FAN, I WOULD SAMPLE IT FIRST BEFORE YOU PURCHASE IT.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Cuts through corporate media hype to real information about the &#34;little people&#34; who don't count. Has been said to be untrue, but live near Pennsylvania and have actually seen some of the devastation there.  Looks like a war zone hit.  Looks like an old western - towns are vacated where booming businesses were. Traffic ruined roads, etc.  Left organic farmers with questionable products.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I just love David Cook's music, there is nothing more to say. He is the best. I am trying to get all of his music.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie, while not historically accurate, is still very entertaining.  Like Independence Day, it is a \\"feel good\\" movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing it.
B004VPAXIY|5.0|WIITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED AND UNIQUE RECORDING ARTISTS IN THIS OR ANY OTHER REALITY OF ALTERNATE DIMENSION. SO UNIQUE IN FACT, IT MAY TAKE MORE THAN ONE LISTEN TO GET THE GIST OF THE SONG.(NOT HATING). IF YOU CAN LOOK UP ANY OF HER VIDEOS ON YOU TUBE, THAT MAY LEND YOU A HAND IN THAT DEPARTMENT. ALSO IF YOU CAN GET USED TO HER WIDE VOCAL RANGE WHICH IS AT TIMES OPERA LEVEL, EVEN OTHERWORLDLY, YOU JUST MIGHT GO 'WOW'.
B000063UR2|5.0|Wish this could be redone in high definition. The filming was fantastic and have watched this several times and never get tired of it.
B000A59PMO|2.0|I like it and the DVD's work however I feel that they might end up getting scratch because a few of the spots for the discs do not hold them very well and every time I open the case up they come falling out.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Enjoyable, but not as stimulating as most of Cornwell's books.  The story moves at a good pace with several disjointed stories that come together at the end.  Interesting, but definitely not her best.  Predicatable toward the end.
B00000DQSS|5.0|OKAY. THE 80S WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DECADES FOR MUSIC. IT WAS FUN. IT WAS COLORFUL. MAYBE MORE THAN CHEESY AT TIMES, BUT SO WHAT. OTHER TIMES IT WAS ALSO A CREATIVE CORNICOPIA OF , WELL, STUFF. THIS CD IS NO DIFFERENT. WELL, KIND OF SORT OF. ONE SONG DEALT WITH THE STUPIDITY OF WAR ,ANOTHER ABOUT TWO NEWLYWEDS AND A GUN ON THEIR HONEYMOON. ANOTHER ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS OF YOUR FAMILY. YOU KNOW, TYPICAL 80S STUFF. OVERALL, ONE OF HER BETTER ALBUMS.
B0065GC0PG|3.0|Cinder, the cyborg, lunar mutant, has an evil step-mother and step-sister.  And an evil aunt is trying to kill her.  Frick, the girl can't catch a break.<br /><br />Early on you figure out who Cinder really is, but I kept reading anyway.  The book was well-written.<br /><br />However, I have a BIG personal pet peeve.  Instead of getting a complete story, I got a cliffhanger and a very incomplete book.  We will get more about Cinder in Scarlet a remake of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\".  Oh, good lord, really, I mean really?  How many fricking books will I be required to buy to get an ending to this story?  It doesn't say.  AT LEAST TWO MORE, sometime in 2015 we might get an ending to Cinder.  So if you shell out at LEAST $32, you might get an ending.  There are only like 200 Grimm's Fairy Tales.<br /><br />I am seriously thinking about becoming Hansel and Gretel, military style, on every author that pulls this CARP.  I would truly like to see a complete book, where I am not required to by 3, 4, 5 books to get a complete story.  Unfortunately, many of the books/authors suffer from premature bookalation.  They start out good, but the story quickly evolves to nothingness, and I am left unsatisfied.<br /><br />Incomplete books that start out well get 3 stars.
B00B671W6W|3.0|Hey if you are a fan of Anthrax. Then you should go ahead and pick this cd up.. Cover Tunes are always fun to Hear. This cd is fun they did a great job with these songs. Especially with Boston's Smokin' Anthrax really Cranked this one out, What a wonderful job overall. Great Vocal performance from Joey Belladonna,  and Music just as well. I really Like this CD Great Job Anthrax and if You don't have Anthrax's Worship Music Cd Get That one Also...Rock On My Friends
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is simply ........ awesome the graphics and everything about this game is awesome and nothing more. Thank you F.G.O.L. and keep it up.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I just can't see how anyone who's seen the previous versions of Les Miserables could enjoy this new version. Same music, same story, same words - just a lot of bad singing. And I mean, seriously bad through the nose plus vibrato singing! Honestly, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe have no business singing! If you like the Les Miserables story but would like to try something new and different, and you don't mind subtitles - watch the french Les Miserables (1995) directed by Claude Lelouch.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I love her looks alot like the character, only wish the other dolls looked like the characters...especially Edward to go with Bella, thats why I don't buy the Edward doll/
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I really did not remember much of the actual story- i was maybe 30 when it happened and enmeshed in personal problems. so I kind of had to take the movie as it was, barely remembering that there was a 'positive' results of sorts. I know that a lot may have been fictionalized as other reviewers mentioned, however as those people lived through those days and even if a scene was 'exaggerated', it helped recreate how tense they may have actually felt.  I had to look at what I may have been like if it affected me- as any of the characters- the Iranian women on the street- the captives- the captors. somehow they portrayed people as people and that was fascinating.<br />It wasn't a movie that took me to a fairy tale world of escape- but I escaped my world for a while and will be thinking about that world for a while. and that is a good thing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This whole series gets 5 out of 5 from me! But this is definitely my favorite one! *spoilers!* So katniss and peeta are fine and they won life is good..... Wrong! I mean cause nothing can go right in poor girls life! So they r on their victory tour but there is a twist their in love right? So everyone what's to know about it!

So Katniss starts to fall for Peeta I mean FINALLY! I'm sorry I love love LOVE Peeta! Well to make a long story short they r sent back into the arena where my favorite character Finnick comes in! Finnick is this ultra sexy guy from district 4 he's a bout 24 and kicks butt! But he's funny too! Yea.......um aaaaaaaaa what!!??!?! Peeta dies!? Well no not really well yes he hits a forcefield and DIES then Finnick comes in and gives him CPR and oh ok peeta all good now I'm fine! Oh and Peeta and Kateniss get engaged and to play the crowd instead of saying that he loves her (witch he still does don't worry Peeta fans) he says that they r already married and that Katniss is pregnant!!!!! Scary!! I mean she's not really but everyone thinks she is!! Then Peeta is taken by the capitol brainwashed then goes INSANE! But that's in Mockingjay. I really like highlighting in my kindle because it lets me Mark where I wouldn't mark in my actual book! So it's nice and I can quickly go to my fave parts so if u totally love the hunger games and have or have not read it GET IT RIGHT NOW!! I've read it 5 times and I can't get enough!

B004J4WLB4|5.0|The main character, Victoria is at times frustrating in her determination to destroy her own happiness, but as the story moves on, she becomes more and more real, and the ending is satisfying.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great tool providing up to date information for multiple locations.  The information is available at a glance.
1932100660|5.0|The book is much more than a discussion of the results of the massive epidemiological study conducted over hundreds of rural Chinese villages to identify the link between diet and diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Those results conclusively support a plant-based vegan diet versus an animal-protein diet. Campbell goes further to explain why animal protein is harmful, for example explaining the biological pathway by which the casein protein in cow's milk causes Type I diabetes in children and activates the T-cells in multiple sclerosis which attack the myelin sheath protecting nerves. He explains that it is not only the cholesterol in meat which is harmful but even animal protein itself which causes harm. The last part of the book, \\"Why haven't you heard this before?\\", exposes the systemic collusion between agriculture, medicine, education and government to oppose publishing scientific research which might affect the profits of the animal food industry. It saddens me to learn that what we have always been told is just not true. For example, the old saying that milk builds strong bones is a myth. In reality, bone fractures caused by osteoporosis actually increase in countries with higher consumption of cow's milk, because the blood acidity caused by animal protein consumption leaches calcium from the bones. I do not have any faith in our Capitalist system where corporations have the power to conceal and distort the truth from the public. I hope that access to Internet sources and books such as this one will break the monopoly of major institutions over the spread of knowledge, but I am pessimistic. The required change from an animal based diet to a plant based diet would be so drastic that I fear that public health will get worse before it gets better. Only the privileged educated elite who have knowledge may benefit. The epidemic of obesity may lead, with other factors such as massive technological unemployment, to a revolutionary overthrow of corporate control of our Capitalist system.ol of our Capitalist system.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Glad to have this in blu-ray format.<br /><br />It is one of my wife's favorite movies and one that I also thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />Too bad that nobody seems to know how to make a movie of this quality today.  Most movies being made today are trash.
B000QUCNXG|4.0|I found the book expressing a view we do not often hear; in a manner without overbearing belligerence. It gives me some pause. The voice was honest. It provokes thought.
1400069289|5.0|This is a fantastic book and as hard as it is to believe the concepts and practical steps detailed in The Power of Habit can eliminate back pain (and many other chronic conditions as well), because our bodies can develop a habit to feel pain.<br /><br />Once I learned that my back and neck pain, pain and numbness in my hands, arms, and legs were simply a habit my body had developed and identified the cues, realized the routines, and the rewards involved I was able to manipulate the routines and change to a more exciting reward to recover rapidly and completely from chronic pain and disability. My story of recovery is explained in Rapid Recovery from Back and Neck Pain: A Nine-Step Recovery Plan.<br /><br />I learned many of the concepts in this book in my college psychology class. It totally changed my outlook on life. I saw all my beliefs and behaviors as sets of habits and set out to change them for the better. I replaced negative thought patterns and beliefs with empowering positive ones, bad habits with good ones.<br /><br />What I love about this book was case studies of how good habits had helped individuals and organizations succeed by making small keystone changes, whether it was a football team or a large company.<br /><br />The point this books makes about will power is also quite illuminating. That will power is in fact a muscle: the more you work it the stronger it gets. Although the author does not discuss will power when he explains how Phelps's daily routine has helped him win so many gold medals, those routines also help build his will power and self-discipline. Self-discipline and will power in other areas of life affect many other areas, including rapid recovery from chronic pain.<br /><br />I would give this book a 10 if I could. It is a book that one has to read several times to really internalize its many lessons.<br /><br />By the way, in my recent book, Rapid Recovery from Enlarged Prostate Symptoms I explain how the same concepts and steps can help a man rapidly recover from enlarged prostate symptoms as well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|GONE GIRL will keep your attention because you want to know how it ends. At first you are on Amy's side but as you get to know her, you truly despise her. She planned her disappearance and murder so cleverly that it's admirable. The sad part is their tense marriage, full of deceit and lies and pretending. I would have liked a different ending where Amy gets what she deserves. The language in the book can be offensive. The author develops the characters very well and knowing their inner thoughts was very well done. I would recommend this book but not to everyone mainly because of the language. However, it does keep your interest and it was well written. You never knew what to expect next.
B002BVZ2GI|2.0|To bad that otherwise potentially good movies are ruined by needless but terribly offensive profanity.  And in this case also ruined by treating marriage in such an offensive way.<br /><br />.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I have read the entire Sword of Truth Series, and this is one of my favorite (that's why I've read it twice).  I feel that this is the book that you really get to know the characters of Richard and Kahlan (if only the TV series would have followed this book a little more closely, it might not have been cancelled).  This is a very long book, but it's storyline moves quickly, and I didn't want to put it down the first time I read it, nor the second time I read it.  If you enjoy adventure and romance, then this series is a must read.
1932735410|5.0|Most certifications, and the courses prepared for them, focus on memorization and drills. Rarely do they offer, or even require, a broader view of the subject matter.<br />The PMBOK certification has always required the student to think in terms of \\"what is best for the organization\\" because great project management assumes that the appropriate tools are in place and that the people using them value their use and maintenance. This may not reflect the real world experience, but it is a starting point for affecting real change in any organization.<br />Rita's book understands and promotes the PMIisms that define the PMBOK worldview. More than this, however, she expands on the baseline infrastructure and provides the tools to understand and use them in real time.<br />Explanations are given as a way for passing the PMBOK test, but they also provide insightful advise for creating, executing and closing large projects.<br />I am sold. I am using the ideas espoused in the book everyday. At work, at home, and even when I am thinking about the little projects that I volunteer for in my community. One can organize anything in ways that give greater meaning to them while providing more value to our lives and the communities we say we serve. Well done Rita! Your memory lives on.

B005HSL626|4.0|For an adult it keeps my flexes quite active. Very exciting to challenge the kids on the score. the only down side with all gaming apps it that could be very addictive.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have read this series several times. While I enjoy other series as well, these books never get old. I am not a teenage girl swooning over vampires. I am a thirty five year old man, with a Master's degree level of education, who has been married for thirteen years. Stephanie Meyer has a gift for first person perspective. Reading her stories is like living these tales through the eyes and heart of Bella and Jacob. I have recommended this beautiful love story to many people before, and I have never known anyone to be disappointed. It is an escape unequalled in my many years of enjoying fiction. It's a light, quick, and immensely enjoyable journey.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|This is a character driven cop drama that makes you like the bad guy.  Even though you know how evil Vic is, you can't help bu to cheer him on as the Antihero.
1442337966|5.0|I never realized how negative my thoughts really were, until I listened and started turning the tiny negative words into positive words. Can't, won't, never - those are words I really try to stray from.  I love the CDs!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I will greatly recommend this. It's exciting to try your hands on it if you are competitive. Unfortunately my 5year old repeatedly beat me to it. As usual, could be very addictive.<br /><br />PA
B00BESJYAY|2.0|The story would have been good but the storyline was choppy and some moments were too smaltzy.  It was kind of boring.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I loved this story. I couldn't put it down, it is beautifully written, with a great twist at the end, wonderful!
B005ZUR724|4.0|Amazing but it needs a couple more classes and you level up so slowly, they should make you level up faster and add like 40 levels to the level cap (which is 60)
0765350386|4.0|I have a major thing for good world-building and this book is on every world-building list. Then I read that it uses a completely unique system of magic so I had to check it out. These elements are indeed outstanding and central to the story. The plot was essentially a fantasy heist. I enjoy scheming and epic battles, but at times the pacing of the plot was inconsistent. Sanderson really plodded through the details of some mundane elements, while rushing through other fascinating things. For instance, we hear a tremendous amount about the decor of noble houses, but when the main character strikes a major stronghold of The Lord Ruler we are told very little and shown even less.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|Gary goes into some excellent ideas for marketing your product or service.  He's honest and down to earth.  This book isn't for those who are looking for excuses, this book is definitely meant to increase your interest in what you want to do, what you love to do and how you can make it happen.  Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an an outstanding description of a  remarkable journey. It is presented with a  wonderful combination of head and heart.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl grabbed me from the very beginning of the book! It was a terrifying novel with all of the twists and turns. It is not often that I can say that I loved a book and absolutely hated and was horrified by the two main characters!<br /><br />I know that several people have not liked the ending but I have no complaints and really enjoyed this thriller!
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love pac man but I'm gonna have to play around with this one on kendall fire,because it's hard to manuver.But I'm still am happy to have it on my fire to play and learn how to work it!!!Thanks from a true pac-man lover,Tammy Wheeler
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book could really piss the person off who looks to everyone else for their demise in society, life, relationships, et al.  If you listen and implement you can definitely make a difference in your life.  Steven has written this book based on the 'resistance' he's encountered.  Highly recommend this if you're looking for 'why' things happen to you in your life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think every one should have this app.  I love this app I aculay think I can handel a real horse.

B001MTENOC|5.0|Very interesting research Mr Newton has done. Well written, lots of back up research.<br />Would love to have to this done to myself.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is an  classic Sci Fi book that I got to re-read.  I read it long ago and wanted to revisit it.  It was better this time than the first time I read it.  I couldn't put it down. It is quite spiritual and really gives one a thought provoking experience.  I found myself slowing down  at the end so that I wouldn't finish it so fast and could enjoy the development of the story.  Even now days after I have finished it I think about  aspects of the story as I relate them to life today.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|It was funny but boring.....doesn't stand out from the first one. I say watch this if you a fan of super hero movies if not this movie will be boring to u
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|This movie won a lot of awards and had a lot of hype that it should not have gotten. The way everyone was talking I was expecting some cinematic masterpiece. This movie is two and half hours long and most of it is easily forgettable. The majority of it was ridiculously boring and the other parts were just okay. Except for the last half hour which at times is so dark it's impossible to tell what's happening. Also, it was hard to understand what anyone was saying so I had to watch it with subtitles. However, the acting was really well done as well as the cinematography, not award worthy but well done.<br /><br />I'm so happy I redboxed this and only spent a dollar. I finished it but I'll never sit through this movie again. Could have been a lot better and should have been a lot shorter. We really don't need five minutes of different camera angles focusing on the same burning helicopter or panoramic views of a random person for an endless amount of time.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|A very well done Bond fill.  One of those rare movies where i was smiling at the end, it steps the series forward.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I liked this book so much, it was hard to put down. I enjoy all of the books written by Nicholas Sparks as stories are good and written in good taste.  Hope he writes many more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this because you can see and hit the numbers you need easily.you can see it well and if you need a light it is bright enough for that too.

B008UTV6S8|5.0|I saw this Paul Simon show on TV one Saturday afternoon and wondered if I could get the CD.  It has lived up to my expecrations because I had never been a fan of him before.  I love the way the whole band takes part in the arrangements of the songs using all different instruments.  I had wanted to go and see his performance while he was in Australia but I couldn't afford it.  This is better because I can play it whenever I want to. Frances.  Dandenong, Victora. Australia
B00004STDN|4.0|This is still one of my favorites if not my favorite of Stallone's movies.  Stallone was absolutely awesome in this movie... he's just bad a@#~!... a TRUE tough guy in my book!  Unfortunately, can't think of even one up and coming actor like him now.  Good story, good acting and a lot of good action!  It'll make you laugh... it's make you want to cry (or @ least tear up a little)... it'll make you cringe...  I've watched this movie many times and never tire of it.  If you are a Sly fan you gotta see it if you haven't already!

B008XG1X18|3.0|I love this app and it keeps me entertained for hours but after running the update it won't stop crashing on my Kindle Fire. If Pinterest can find a way to fix this then it will be one of my top apps. Other than that it's wonderful.
0446554995|5.0|Because 760 reviews of \\"Two Graves\\" have already been posted, I'd better avoid the comments that I'm sure appear in hundreds of others and find something to say that, with luck, will be original.<br /><br />But before that, let me add my accolades to the others no doubt given. This is one of the best Preston and Child novels yet. The authors have a fine gift for tone and style, as can be seen by the almost Shakespearean oeuvre of Pendergast quotations that at least one person has started to collect. (OK, maybe Shakespearean is an exaggeration, but still . . . .) But along with that, \\"Two Graves\\"'s regular references to prior Pendergast novels made me realize that Preston and Child have created an extraordinary literary world in the past two decades, peopled with memorable characters whose influence resonates in \\"Two Graves\\" even if they're now dead, as some are.<br /><br />I consider myself to have a good vocabulary, and yet this is once again a Preston-Child novel in which I find myself repairing to the dictionary to look up words, this time espagnolettes, credit cozen, the Nazi Parteiadler (the emblem of the eagle atop a swastika that was the party insignia), and an Eickhorn hewer (a German knife used by the Nazis in World War II).<br /><br />There's a smattering of Portuguese in \\"Two Graves.\\" It's a language that I happen to know and out of which I translate into English as a side occupation. Here, the authors have done a creditable job of injecting Portuguese phraseology in a way that gets the meaning across for people who don't speak the language. (There's also some German in the novel. I don't speak German and if I'd read \\"Two Graves\\" rather than listened to it, I'd have kept my pocket German-English W&ouml;rterbuch handy.) As I've mentioned to them in an e-mail, I'll be happy to help them with the Romance languages, including Portuguese or French, in any future work they do. For example, Colonel Souza once or twice signals his men to ready for combat with the phrase \\"estão prontos.\\" That means \\"you are ready,\\" so it's not quite right. \\"Preparem-se para atacar\\" (\\"prepare to attack\\") would have been better. This is not even a criticism, but merely a public reiteration of my offer to help if they need it in future novels. (Who knows, maybe future plot elements will unfold in Portugal, Angola, or Cape Verde, as well as Brazil. There was plenty of Nazi and Allied intrigue in Portugal in World War II.) Also, the marvelous Ren&eacute; Auberjonois often mispronounces the words, and I'm available to help with that too.ase \\"estão prontos.\\" That means \\"you are ready,\\" so it's not quite right. \\"Preparem-se para atacar\\" (\\"prepare to attack\\") would have been better.

1939416019|1.0|I have never read a more poorly conceived, constructed, or researched novel in my life. This book lurches from improbable to impossible situation on the broken wings of repetitive, cliched phrases and malapropisms. Careless editing does nothing to enhance the author's poorly envisioned world and paucity of imagination. $2.99 is FAR to much to pay for this drivel.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good but I wish there was a little more instructions. Also as you level if you are going to need more energy you should also receive more coins for a quest.

0345505387|2.0|I was very disappointed with this graphic novel.  I didn't expect a retelling of \\"Outlander\\"; what I did expect was the story told from another perspective and maybe a storyline that wasn't included in the original book.  I couldn't tell who was saying what because the male characters all look alike...you can't distinguish one from the other.  It was plainly a waste of my time and money.
B009NX4PVU|5.0|This was the first movie that addressed in a nut shell the rights of being a human, gay and the power of Justice done right, reminding us how ignorant we can be when it comes to aids and many other human behaviors. A wonderful cast of actors and a story line that will touch your heart no matter what your personal belives are, this is a human story.

1608955702|5.0|I have read many books on lighting, but found this one to be the simplest, but yet the most clear and helpful yet. Neil takes a complex subject and breaks it down in to easy to understand elements. It makes you want to go out and shoot.
1469225700|3.0|The Malazan books have been on my list for a long time. Book one, Gardens of the Moon, is an incredibly complex story with many character points of view. I listened to several hours of the audio book before starting over to make sure I was tracking the plot and characters. Other reviews I have read suggest the first book is an investment and that the story is easier to follow as the series progresses.<br /><br />Sorry, aka Apsalar, seems as though she should be much more important to the story. She is possessed by an evil god of some sort early in the book, but then she becomes nothing more than a annoying (though murderous and scary) side character in Whiskeyjack's squad. Then, by no doing of her own, she is freed from the possession and becomes Apsalar. Sorry / Apsalar is acted upon and does nothing to make the reader like her or be interested in her story (besides being a truly innocent victim).<br /><br />New characters are introduced late in the book. Old characters change their goals and allegiance without sufficient explanation.<br /><br />Despite everything, Gardens of the Moon is an imaginative story with many loyal followers. I was disappointed with the book, but plan to read at least one more in the series, since other readers have promised the writing gets better. Ralph Lister did an excellent job narrating this book, but I think it might have been easier to follow in print.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Although I have seen every 007 movie ever made, Skyfall at times isn't as &#34;James Bond-y&#34; as the previous films. Occasionally the James Bond theme music kicks in and the feeling changes. The film is slow at times, not as many &#34;gadgets&#34; as the other movies but all in all... it's 007! I would recommend this film to James Bond fans no matter what... even if it's NOT like &#34;Thunderball&#34;, &#34;Goldfinger&#34; or some of the early James Bond films. One thing is.... WHAT A CAR!!!! (I won't spoil it for those of you that haven't seen it yet).
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I am very pleased with this game. It is fun to create and evolve the dinosaurs. I only wish for one thing. That you &quot;the creators&quot; will assign more servers and allow us to view our experience points. Other than what was previously stated, I Love It.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|When I first got it, it looked real.... and then I opened the box. First of all, the screen had dots all over it and the screen protector wasn't even fitted to the screen. There were raised parts in the screen. Also, the mute button was disconnected. Got a full refund though. Beware of this buyer, I'm not the only victim, read his seller reviews.

B0092ZEIN4|4.0|Granted I've only had this controller for 2 days, but it worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't even have to map controls to mupen64, and the mapping on SNESdroid works great as well. I looked at the comments ahead of time and didn't even bother with the app, so I haven't had problems with it yet. The little joystick nub things are kind of stiff and annoying, but I like the portability so i'm fine with it. The hardward seems well put together otherwise, and for $30 this is one of the most inexpensive bluetooth controllers I have found on amazon. So overall i'm pretty impressed, the reason for 4 stars is the stupid charger \\"dongle\\" thing... so pointless in my opinion, but if you have a tablet or a smartphone you should have a charger that works with it anyway, so only a slight annoyance.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Loved the book and the action woven into it. It was  interesting and played with my emotions. But it took a while to get to the point. I was ready for it to be over.

B000FC1MCS|2.0|Definately so unpredictable it is almost predictable.  Not my type of book.  I like honesty and realism and ths book had none of that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. I am always playing it, and it is absolutely flawless! The only thing is all the advertisements:/ But that doesn't mean it goes down a star! Download this app, no regrets!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoyed this season as much as the two prior ones.  Would love to say more but afraid to spoil it for others.  Can't wait for the next season to start!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|David Weber, in my opinion, is an amazing writer. The Honor Harrington series was one of my favorites to read and still is worth rereading today. Though I find myself staring cross-eyed into the pages when he goes on about technical specs, it's balanced well with enough action to keep you coming back for more. Some parts, however, do get a little too in-depth into background information for me, but it does go a ways to setting up the plot for this book as well as the entire series by giving you the underlying stresses and fractures in the system.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I was so glad to find this app, I am not a fanatical player but I do enjoy playing to unwind and I hated the little ad in the corner, blocking my view! Many times I'd have to wait for it to disappear before playing. Now if they could just get game stats to save so when you get a new phone you don't have to start over...

B002PNER9U|5.0|This movie is fun, touching, entertaining and has a great message. I've watched it many times and I am never disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This season's a tad weaker than the first or third, but still great nonetheless.  I love the Anna and Bates story line, and I'd really love to kick O'Brien and Thomas in the shins just for good measure. That's the sign of good writing and acting -- those characters are very realistic.<br /><br />Keep watching and enjoying \\"Downton Abbey!\\"
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I purchased the copy and played on my laptop.  The sound was SO LOW that I could barely hear it at max volume.  I later purchased a copy from Costco that played with normal volume.  Quite disappointed in the seller.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well done credible story. Science fiction in the near future and very believable. Interesting and effective first person chronology. Very good scientific explanations without getting too detailed.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Excellent ensemble cast with multiple strong characters who have complex and motivations and internal conflicts.  Good pacing and drama that highlights moral conflict or moral ambiguity of the cops facing life and death situations.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What more can be said about this masterful series? Its rare high level of acting, writing, exquisite attention to every detail, virtually a labor of love in bringing back a very special and world-changing time in history as lived by the quintessential aristocratic family in early 20th century, is already so well known and commented upon that I can only add to the pile of accolades. Interestingly, we have found that we are paying a bit more attention to our own speech and catch ourselves echoing certain recurring phrases from the series. There are moments here and there that make us pause and reflect on what we just experienced, and then play it again to make sure we got it right, it's just that good. We will certainly watch the entire series again so as to catch even more detail that infuses every scene. And be assured that the creators do not resort to any sort of cheap trickery to keep you watching; there are no cheap cliff hangers and the series ends on a very satisfying note, but yet still making one yearn for more. They have set the bar up, way up...
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Excellent choice for an Aerosmith cd delivered way earlier than expected but appreciated  Not much else to say but thanks for the cd and the price was right
B00A03WBVI|5.0|I have loved One Directions music from the beginning. \\"Take Me Home\\" is energetic, fun pop music; easy to sing along to and understand the words. Fun for everyone 2 to 82, it's a great mix of dance, soft, and rock music with meaningful lyrics and cheeky banter. It certainly helps when the ultra talented Ed Sheeran wrote two of the tracks on the album. This sophomore effort is well worth the purchase price and is a step in the right \\"direction\\" as One Direction grows up and improves with age!
B0080M3OGW|2.0|Two great and attractive actors have absolutely no real on-screen chemistry in this slow paced absurdly contrived sequence of &#34;coincidental&#34; encounters.

B001HN6922|3.0|My girls do not really like this particular PIXAR movie; however, since my wife and I are avid PIXAR fans and own every single movie that they have made, I had to get it.  This movie is based on the James Bond movies in many different ways and only the adults will get a lot of the spy related action in the movie.  I do think that it is a good movie with a good story line, new characters, and action.  I recommend it to the true PIXAR lover; however, your kids may not think it is the best.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Amazingly fun just when you think that it is getting boring, they add in water that some birds float on and some sink in. Get it, no draw backs because it is free.

B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Bowie's \\"The Next Day\\" is not the \\"best album since Scary Monsters,\\" a phrase so much abused over the years as to be rendered meaningless.  The \\"best\\" since \\"Scary Monsters\\" was \\"Heathen\\" followed by \\"Reality,\\" \\"TND\\" being equal to those early 2000s albums, particularly in production values thanks to Tony Visconti and Bowie's casting off of successive musical wardrobes.  If you put all of the 3 albums into a playlist, adding the contemporaneous b-sides and outtakes, you'll have a hard time separating out the tracks.  Plus, you'll have an enjoyable playlist illustrating that the cohesiveness and strength of this late period can proudly stand next to his 70s oeuvre.<br /><br />I love this album and that Bowie has returned to us after his break and with relevancy.  Many of the tracks subject's are challenging and disturbing as the best of Bowie always is.  Sense of doubt, indeed.  I've been wondering when the song Valentine's Day was written.  The lyrics, \\"It's in his tiny face/It's in his scrawny hands,\\" could be a description of Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary shooter of Dec 14, 2012.  Or is it referencing the Valentine's Day shooting in 2008 by Steven Kazmierczak at Northern Illinois U?

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a great sci-fi book, especially if you like 80's pop culture. It really pulls you into this authors interperetation of what the future will look like. An extremely popular immersive simulator called oasis is where the main character effectively lives his life. Well written, an interesting plot, and actually thought-provoking.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is hard but douable. It really gets you up and sweating. I have been doing this dvd for 4 days and already and I feel amazing. Previously I was mildly in shape.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When 2 of  my kids asked me about reading Fifty Shades, they gave me a brief story of what story was about. As I began the first book, I almost put it down ready to read another book.  I was comfortable reading some of it. Then I decided to be proactive and continued. I am really glad I continued through all 3 book's.  What an amazing story!  It is a very believable story where this truly could be a biography. In a couple parts were predictable, and I was surprised of who the villains were.  People's private lives are theirs.  I'm no longer shocked, rather understanding.
B005LAII12|5.0|Well if your feeling sad, this is a good movie to watch even though it is out of the ordnary. Very funny.

B00BI73CVI|3.0|This could have been the greatest movie musical ever filmed if it werent for the bizarre choices the director and cinematographer made on how to shoot this. Jittery hand held shots, extreme close ups, weird fish eye lens shots and weird angles, make no sense at all, do not fit the material, and are a huge distraction. A more classical approach would have worked much better for this story.That said, great cast, costumes sets etc. Samantha Barks is the real sensation. And Russell Crowe didnt bother me as much as he did other people. Good film, but not great.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great book I like that he doesn't just tell the story from one perspective but it can be a little hard to follow. I also feel like it's more of a true fantasy novel there's LESS magic than in some other books I have read but there's still some. I like the wit too it isn't forced and its very sarcastic and well done all in all there is a lot to be said for the book I just hope the show lives up to it

B009AMALLM|5.0|First time preordering a movie, got it when it was promised to me and was able to see it on time for the paranormal party xD
B005MZIF4Q|4.0|This was a good book. Full of great facts and pictures. Funny new records that were broken. Nothing that I would ever do.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really neat item to have. It helps you keep up with how much battery life you have left.
1609613937|5.0|I believe this is Dr McDougall's capstone book. It is right on as all his work has been. I have followed his recommendations for years and I believe that is a good part of why I enjoy great health at seventy plus years of age. This book is a great resource for those who want to lose weight or just simply enjoy better health and longer life free of the diseases that plague most Americans. I cannot recommend this book too highly!
B002HTWYZ6|5.0|I put five stars to emphasize the perfect quality of K2HD mastering. A luxury background music for a champagne party !
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Once I start playing this game,it's hard to stop. I get caught up it and it's hard to stop. Great graphics.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition for the Kindle Fire is good. Mojang needs to add stuff to PE in general. But overall this is pretty good
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is very nice to have because it gives you very detailed information about how long the battery will last depending on certain tasks.<br /><br />It also has a very slick interface that you can customize the appearance of to your liking.<br /><br />Probably my favorite thing about it though is that it has a feature that tells you how long it will take to charge it which is usually pretty darn accurate.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I recently purchased my Anker gaming mouse to replace by Logitech G700 unit.  I find the form-fit and button positions much more comfortable.  My only comment would be the weight of the unit.  I prefer a heavy mouse, and even with the optional weight system the unit is still rather light in weight.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I loved this album. I loved that it came with a charm and had bonus songs. Everything about it was worth the money.
B0012GMUPO|5.0|I bought this Alice Cooper album in April 2011.  It features many well known, musical guest stars, which make this album, \\"TRASH\\", one hell of a fantastic piece of Rock & Roll. I would like to offer my review & opinion of each song, as follows:<br /><br />1. \\"Poison\\"...This song has the word EXCELLENT written all over it. This song was on the Top 40 charts for 10 weeks, reaching #7 in October 1989.  I love this song very much, it's definitely my favorite song incl., here.<br /><br />2. \\"Spark In The Dark\\"...This song is good, but NOT one of my favorites!<br /><br />3. \\"House Of Fire\\"...This was a smaller hit from 1990. Another song w/ the word EXCELLENT written all over it.  Joe Perry is a featured guitarist here, which probably explains why the song is so good & also why I love it so much. It is another one of my favorites.  Joan Jett is ONE of the co-writers of this song.<br /><br />4. \\"Why Trust You\\"...This is a rather comical song & the words make me laugh a lot.  I enjoy this song quite a bit.<br /><br />5. \\"Only My Heart Talkin\\"...One of the ballads that feature Steven Tyler on additional vocals. It was a smaller hit single from 1990, although I was never too familiar w/ this song.  I rate this song as passable & it's NOT one of my favorites.<br /><br />6. \\"Bed Of Nails\\"...A smaller hit from 1989, which I do REMEMBER & I really like quite well. I think that this song is rather unique.<br /><br />7. \\"This Maniac's In Love With You\\"...I guess this WASN'T considered as a hit, but this song was very familiar to me, when I FIRST bought this CD.  I like this song a great deal.<br /><br />8. \\"Trash\\"...Here is the TITLE SONG, which features Jon Bon Jovi on additional vocals.  This song is good, but NOT one of my favorites.<br /><br />9. \\"Hell Is Living Without You\\"...This song is SLOWER, but I like this one, quite well.<br /><br />10. \\"I'm Your Gun\\"...This song features Kip Winger on additional vocals.  This song is only okay, it's my LEAST favorite song to close outthis album.<br /><br />I have read on SOME of Amazon's reviews that this was Alice Cooper's COMEBACK album.  Even if it was HIS comeback album of 1989, I gave this album a 5 star rating. This album is most definitely recommended.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have seen this advertised much higher elsewhere. Arrived in 3 days and is great to watch. I purchased season 1 last year and intend to buy season 3 next year. Extra features are OK, nothing extraordinary.
B0040FMG2G|5.0|This is what film was invented for. Along with &#34;Gone with the Wind, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Lincoln&#34; and others Master and Commander borders on film perfection.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Once I start playing this game,it is hard to stop. I get caught up it and forget about everything else.
B000AARKW6|2.0|It skips.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this is an awesome book it makes you not want to put it down once u start reading you definitely do not want to stop
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This movie reminds us of all the complexity of what is means to be Human. And brings up the age old human search of what it is to have a relationship with a creator. A roller-coaster ride through the Sistine Chapel.
B003ES61EE|5.0|Not much to this little thing, but it works as it should and was a good value. Not sure what you could get by going with one of the more expensive brands.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I'm not one for romance, but i was glued on page one. The sweet movement of their feelings sweep you up along with them. A real page turner!
B0091REZMW|5.0|it is a good game with lots of friendly players who are always willing to help out. gotta give five stars for the bonus. worth it! it really is fun though.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|His quick wit and passion at his best. Get lost in lincoln lawyer. I would let him be my lawyer anytime.
B0036R92V2|5.0|I'm sure I'm one of the many people who were aware this film existed thanks to QT's Django Unchained. I'm glad I took the chance to buy this movie and try it out. It's an awesome movie. I've seen quite a few westerns and this one is somewhat different from the rest. It has a unique style to it and it's very gritty and violent (Very violent). After watching it, I am now convinced that Franco Nero IS DJANGO! Defenetly go check it out.<br /><br />Audio & Video is great for a movie from the 60's BTW.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Keeps my son enthralled for hours at a time.  Perfect gift!!  It is safe for kids and I would recommend it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this show.The storys are fun and the actors are great. If you like thrilling shows you will love this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I struggle with insomnia. This solitaire app helps me fall asleep. By focusing my mind on something that requires concentration, I find myself getting very sleepy, very fast! This one is the most like the game that comes pre-installed on your Windows PC.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I admit I had some fun with this app<br />Not a bad app a little blotchy for my<br />but hey I expect too much so give it a<br />Go or not get off me all ready.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Religious?  Doesn't matter, must read for yourself and future generations.  You won't be disappointed one bit.  Once you start, you cannot put it down.  Or in my Kindle case, shut down.  :)
B009FZFONO|5.0|All the edge-of-your-seat action you've come to expect from this wildly suspenseful TV series.  Perfect mixture of intense action and intriguing story line.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Charming characters with an understanding of the English culture. Author's writing shows a bias toward the ladies. Though showing the struggles endured by all classes.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love, love, love this series!! Have watched it several times. The characters are interesting and deep.  You'll love it too!
0307352153|4.0|\\"Everyone shines, given the right lighting. For some, it's a Broadway spotlight, for others, a lamplit desk.\\"<br /><br />In Quiet:  The Power of Introverts in a Society That Can't Stop Talking (Crown Publishing, 2012), Susan Cain writes a meticulously researched and well-argued plea for equality.  Not for women or for minorities, but for introverts.  In a society that values extroversion, she believes, we need to look closely at the value that introverts bring to the equation.  That value, according to Cain, is vast.  If invention is ninety nine percent perspiration and one percent inspiration, then the introverts are responsible for the ninety nine percent, in essence.  The introverts are largely the ones who work on their own, hashing it all out, putting it together and taking it apart again until it works.  What they lack in flash and dazzle, they make up for in persistence.  Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt, Gandhi:  all examples introverts who avoided the bright lights in order to pursue their true interests and beliefs, and we all benefitted from the results.<br /><br />The true beauty of this book lies in the permission it grants:  Cain, an introvert herself, is resolute on the idea that introverts are much healthier and happier if they are allowed to remain introverts.  Cain demonstrates that introversion is much more accepted in the east then the west, and reassures fellow introverts that it is not only alright to stay home and read on a Friday night, it is a right.  It is necessary and productive and totally normal.<br /><br />If you are not a closet (or overt) introvert, this book is just as valuable.  Cain speaks directly to parents, teachers, bosses, and spouses of introverts.  How do you best teach and parent introverts?  How do you make sure that introverts are heard and involved in decision making?  Cain makes a great argument for valuing introverts in the workplace, even suggesting that the recent economic market collapse in the U.S. could have been avoided if more \\"risk-averse\\" introverts had spoken up during board meetings.  Cain urges us to find a balance between the extroverts and introverts in our society, and within ourselves.
B002U1F32M|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I watched it....  it's nice to see a &#34;love story&#34; that involves a guy being the romantic .... Loved Zooey and Josephs chemistry
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A moving introspective of a man who knows he doesn't fit right in the world but isn't quite sure why. An honest, but painful process of discovery that doesn't necessarily yield the desired outcome, but still has a good result. Read the entire book in one day!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|The movie has plenty of humor and a good story, with great characters. The voice work is great. The movie's strength lies in its characters and all the little touches here and there. Good movie.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|He an incredible actor.he can act out any scene.this man is gifted.i love to see denzel act.i hope he gets an oscar for his performance.will come and see any movie hes in.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|it would of been better if you guys didn't advertise it as free. you should of let it be known it was a free trial.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|I love this one!  Every track is amazing!  Big fan of The Black Keys.  So much rock and so bluesy!!
0307341577|4.0|Dark Places did not reel me in and obsess me. That is what Sharp Objects did to me.I was amazed by everything about it but mostly the sultry,southern feel( althought to me, Missouri isnt the south). I felt I was there. The characters fascinated me.I read it during a very hectic time in my life<br />and I thought about it constantly when I couldn`t read.Gone Girl was another absolute page turner, so well done, i was hesitant to read any of her other books, thinking what could top a book like this?<br /><br />Dark Places...I wanted to feel the same way about Dark Places and it was a haunting story of a sad family. There are so many synopses already. I`ll just touch on a few things. I have had a problem with the ending of all three books and this one is a bit far out, however, I would prefer that to the somewhat blunt ending of Gone Girl.I found it easy to sympathize with the characters,although the Day children were promblematic and pathetic ,the reader could see why.<br /><br />I find it really hard to read the animal abuse present in this book and Sharp Objects.I just have to skim over it. It is just too upsetting to me.<br /><br />I think Gillian Flynn is a superb writer.Her prose blew me away in Sharp Objects. I would recommend Dark Places to anyone but to me, it`s just not QUITE as good as the other two. Read it though.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I was looking forward to the movie but did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  Some of the singing parts were not good, but that is because they cast actors in the movie instead of singers.  They had some good sets and costumes but I wish some of the actors were changed.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I could play this game with a regulation xbox/ps3 controller... or even a simple joystick. I would probably even enjoy it, but I have no desire to play a side scrolling platformer by franticly swiping the screen. The graphics are good and the swipe and/or tap controls work well enough. Even though I was always a big fan of the Super-Mario genre, which this is arguably similar to, I'm just not that into it.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|My daughter love the movie..the sound track was a bonus..shipping was fast and secure...thanks for having a great selection for a great price...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a great game I love to play it almost every day I well tell my friends and family about this game
B009QW7HMC|1.0|The show is great but Amazon's delivery is very poor.  This was a wast of money.  the show continued to stop after the first minute then the Amazon system went down.  I had great signal strength, so that was not an issue.  I ended up using iTunes for this episode and it was flawless with a great picture.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I start playing and lose total track of time.  It is very relaxing.  No way to play in a moving car though.
B0036BDPOI|2.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a TERRIBLE sounding remaster of a great album. With my $1500 Turntable/cartridge I could not get it to track the entire side three properly, and my set up passes the Hi Fi Audio News Test LP at +15db. Ripped into ProTools for computer editing I \\"created\\" a non-skipping mix that needed several db of EQ (especially on the mids/upper midrange) cut to make it not sound like Guitar Center on a Saturday morning amp wankers through Behringer PA cabinets. In certain spots-certain solos where it's only a three piece, the bottom end just...goes away, like it's brick-wall limited, which again doesn't make sense when on the hottest passages there are example of it holding together and staying relatively punchy.<br /><br /> This is totally unacceptable on a double LP for under an hour's music where the ass-u-med POINT of that would be to be able to cut a pure from the master tape, wider dynamic range pressing with less jerking with, like I feel has happened to me after paying prime vinyl reissue money for this. In ProTools I can see that it's not a real hot recording, and in fact the surface noise isn't really the issue. As an audiophile who appreciates any attempt to improve the quality of music and as a transplanted Texan who has met friends and family of the band, this is just sad.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the book!  It was definitely more detailed than the movie.  The story line was interesting, and it kept me on the edge of my seat.
B003V9M0RS|4.0|Good little headphones. Light and comfortable.<br />Reasonable sound reproduction but can't fold them up.<br />I prefer the KOSS porta pros . Theyre more portable and the overall sound is better.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is very easy to get hooked on this game.  But I hate when I have to get my grandson to get me off levels when I am stuck.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After seeing the first 2 seasons I couldn't possibly pass up the 3rd. I love these English soap operas, PBS does them so well. I watched Upstairs Downstairs when it was originally shown years ago and loved every minute of it.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Excellent show, watched this several times. Highly recommend to all broadway lovers.<br />Nothing about this I did not like. Worth the money
B008M7JODC|5.0|once you watch it it will have you hooked, you will want to watch all the seasons in a marathon once you start
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I first saw on BBC a few years ago, and I'm really happy this movie was offered as a purchase.<br />I really enjoyed watching and thought the performances were truly exceptional.  Very entertaining.  I love the time period, and it reminds you of what a different world it was back then.  Will definately share with friends.  Loved it!
B006WAIV6M|2.0|I bought this book to help with anxiety as anxiety is meant to be habitual in as much as part of the brain has learnt to over - respond with the fight or flight response when it is not needed.<br />The book was indeed informative on how habits are formed but nowhere did it tell you how to actually go about changing your old unhelpful habits in to new helpful ones.<br />So disappointing!
B00371XIJE|5.0|This movie is centered around a dog (Hachi) and his owner (Richard Gere). The setting is in a quaint little town that reminds me of times of the past. The love and compassion that Gere and Joan Allen share are what marriage should be. The love, compassion and loyalty that Gere and Hachi share are what signifies the true meaning of &#34;man's best friend&#34;. I won't say anymore because everyone should see this movie. Just have a couple of boxes of Kleenex near by...
1476734941|2.0|I watched the BBC Horizon program hosted by the author and thought it was fabulous.  No need, at all, to purchase the book if you've viewed the show (which is easily found on the internet). I love the idea of prolonging a healthy life, preventing the onset of alzheimer's, cancer and dementia... and of course taking off a couple of pounds is always a welcome idea!  However, I've been on this program (diet) for two weeks... I've actually gained several pounds.  The first couple of days i lost several pounds, but they came back... and more!  The fast days are tough (no matter what you read... especially if your a mom and you cook breakfast, lunch and dinner), but i managed.  The real key to this diet is if you want the weight loss to be part of the program you must not cheat on your off days.  I ate regularly on my non fast days, plus did indulge in a piece of banana bread or chocolate if i wanted... that can't be done... at least not initially... if your goal is weight loss... I promise (i learned the hard way).  But, hopefully the other health benefits will occur.  Good luck to you... and again... no need to purchase the book!
B001F0VHEM|4.0|Not even close to her best effort.  We all don't always succeed at everything.  I don't have anymore to say.
B001KTATIS|5.0|the movie was good,little old. picture wasn't great bluray would probably be better but now I know where Spartacus got  some of its story
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book, very interesting. Just when you think you understand what's going on, you really you don't.  Definitely keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Get tubemate instead its more stable less spammy works better you can get a link from several different sites that they test from xda developers forum if you don't have a high resolution screen they will prompt you to get flv player which will send you a email solicitation for a game or anti virus program maybe once a week its spam but they wont spam you to death.<br />I use it all the time to load up videos you can even string together full movies documentaries etc no connection no problem.
B008J34466|5.0|I love this C.D.  I am going to see Pink in concert in Cleveland, Ohio on Nov. 23rd.  Your minimum word answer is totally STUPID !!!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|It is ok, but I had to download a different application of the KJV Bile so it could be used whenever I needed (or wanted) it.  This application will only work when you are connected to the Internet.  There are times when I would want access to the Bible, but would be unable to because of not being online.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so much fun. there is lots to do. new things each week.I woulld recommend this game for certain.
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|This book deserves a five star rating! If you have read the book and seen the movie, you will understand why.
0736092269|5.0|not knowing to much about what workouts work which part of your body....i learned so much from this book it has pictures and names everything loved loved loved it
B0064X7FVE|4.0|There is really only one thing that is a bother to me.  I am not sure if it on this application, or if it's with my Kindle Fire HD.  But this application gives you choices on what your weather is &#34;Now&#34;; &#34;Hourly&#34;; &#34;36 hours&#34;; and &#34;10 Day&#34; forecasts.  No matter how often I have tried to fix this irritation, I cannot...on only one of the above mentioned &#34;forecasts&#34;, my info will come to me in centimeters, rather than inches; and that same page will only show me temperatures in Celsius rather than Fahrenheit.  Other than that, it seems to do a good job.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Very funny which surprised me because it looked like it would be pretty lame. Its now part of my movie collection and I am very happy with it.
0792835050|5.0|If you like a book full of suspense and intrigue, this book is for you! Ken Follett is a master suspense novelist.<br />The movie was very good, as well.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Me encanta este juego lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados a todos los que le gusten entretenerse en los videojuegos me Gusta
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I always have several important things that I need to keep track of. I use this application to make different &#34;books&#34; to keep my info on my Kindle Fire HD.  For instance, I've made one &#34;book&#34; to keep track of my mileage; another for items needed to purchase; one book is used to keep a chart of my daily blood pressure, etc.  You can make as many &#34;books&#34; as you want.  The book covers can be chosen from a variety of looks; you can have a blank page or a page  with lines; you can change the color of the pages; the type and size of font; plus you can draw on pages too!  I am thankful that I have chosen &#34;Notebooks Pro&#34;!
0765325950|4.0|...or at least an ending.  Looks like there is room for more stories if the new author wanted to take up some of the threads.
B002LANLDK|5.0|excellent movie especially if you like the fast and furious movies this one helps combine them all together very well
B005C8ENI0|5.0|If it had done better at the box office, this could have been the first of many McConaughey-as-Mickey Haller movies, but it looks like we'll have to settle for this one. And it is exceptional. Why it wasn't a hit I don't know. Perhaps it asked too much of the viewer, demanding too many inferences to carry the story. But if you have read the book first, as I did, the movie is a spot-on and easy to follow rendition of a terrific crime novel.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Lovely,all of the songs are similar to those hou hear on the rsdio.<br />Nb. Bhakti bbbbbgg bbg nigh bbg vbbbb
B00499QUK2|5.0|The acting and cinematography are excellent. The plots are intriguing with surprising evidence and conclusions and are modern day adaptations of the original Sherlock Holmes series.
B0095P31L6|2.0|More adult oriented, animation is great story is just ok.  Johnny Depp give it some hope with his voice talent.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a totally great read for me. I was educated as an engineer and grew up working on cars and trucks. I was always doing troubleshooting and making do with the tools and materials. Sometimes it was while stranded in remote, dangerous areas. This story really struck a cord with me; but it was really engaging and well written. Okay, I'm not a literary critic, obviously. But if a story keeps my attention, makes me want to keep reading, and gives me surprises; that's a great read! I highly recommend it and can't wait to see what he does next.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am a fan of most PBS British productions, and the Downton series is a deliciously long and complex and engaging story.  I own the whole series and look forward to viewing it many more times in the future.  I only found fault in the ending episode which did not resolve in the way I would have wanted!
B00947N6D8|5.0|If you want a warm, cute, action packed animated movie then look no further. Rise of the Guardians is a great movie. It is really clever in its plot lines and is really cute. It has a great message and give the view hope about anything. I love it. A MUST WATCH
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Ok. I enjoy the game. It works great with facebook. But the sound effects are absolutely terrible!!! Is it a glitch? I would recommend this game but I would also recommend turning the sound off...
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun but some of the missions are rediculous. I'm just being honest.Like Big Ben. I can't offord that.<br />I've been stuck on it for days.You should be able to skip missions.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|This book did not seem believable. It was too repetitious and did not hold my attention. I did not even care to finish it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love peter jackson and his long-winded-ness so I love this movie and I cannot wait for the next three movies. The two disk product is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game because it challenges you to collect a certain amount of eggs and coins in order to get boards and characters.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|This movie was awesome and very realistic.  It has been helpful to friends who have been to rehab.  I highly recommend it to those struggling with addiction and their families.
B00B935SUY|5.0|That's right, not just a documentary that informs, but this one is also fun.  Music lovers of all genre will most likely enjoy; not so sure about non-music lovers, but who cares about them?
B008KOTNVA|4.0|I bought this because of the triangle bit for some mac products.  It has a lot of bits the only reason i didn't give it a 5 is because of the price.  It's not american made so i don't know why the cost is so high.  When it comes to tools you get what you pay for at this price i would think it would be made in the USA.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I have had to re-install this game three times. It would freeze up and lock up, and would lose information. I like the game but it keeps losing data, my score, my progress. FIX THE BUGS AND IT WOULD BE A GREAT GAME!
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book.  First time I have used a book online that I can read on my smartphone.  Might just turn me into an eReader.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I love the Black Keys and this album is great.  It pumps me up while I am at work at the end of the day when i am beginning to wear down.
B0037UUZQY|4.0|Bought this doll to replace another rapunzel doll that broke! My daughter loves this doll she plays with it all the time the dress is adorable good material! The hair we have to keep braided or it gets tangled in everything!
B004C4IKCU|4.0|Another beautiful production from Sony,the kind that music lovers want.The music itself of course represents one of the greatest singers in music history.No modern collection of classic rock can do without Elvis Presley,the truck driver from Memphis who travelled from blues to rock and roll.
B00BL5EQLC|2.0|Ive seen dozens of similar apps with the same format so it wasnt like this was an earth shattering discovery.  I tried over and over to follow the tuturial and got thru the first levels but the controls didnt seem to work well.  Often swiping up or down would cause the game to constantly pause and often tapping on the wall didnt work.  After 10 minutes, I got frustrated and decided this was not worth keeping because it wasnt better than simpler apps with the same premise
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It is a really good game and I highly recommend it for any of the shark loving people. You really feel like your in the ocean and it has great graphics.<br />Please get this games you will love it
B00BTLSURE|5.0|This is by far OneRepublic's best work to date, which is certainly saying something.<br /><br />I had very high expectations for this album after &#34;Feel Again&#34; and &#34;If I Lose Myself&#34; were released, and by no means did it disappoint.<br /><br />Every song on Native is near the top of the list of the best songs I've ever heard. A trend I've been carrying since Dreaming Out Loud, Tedder continues to have one of the best voices of which I'm aware, and his band continues to be one of the best of which I'm aware.<br /><br />The fact that OneRepublic has stayed this long above Björk, Arcade Fire, and even Jonathan Coulton in my list of fantastic music creators ought to be enough to prove that it is among the best bands of all time, and that Native is definitely their best work to date means that I believe that every person on Earth must listen to this album before they die.<br /><br />Bucket list 2% complete.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Once upon a time,I imagine The Rolling Stones turned me on to blues.They played songs by Slim Harpo,Jimmy Reed,Bo Diddley - and Muddy Waters, who gave them their name,from the Rollin´Stone song.Muddy is my hero in the blues,as The Stones are my number 1 band( I have their logo - mouth and tongue - tattooed on my right arm).So,a match marriage made in heaven,You think?Well,not really so.But I am so glad that they did it,just like they performed with John Lee Hooker in 1989.
B002JVWR54|5.0|I was really a fan of Dollhouse.  It is too bad it only lasted two seasons.  Enjoy the experience when you sit down to view it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game. Every time I play I end up losing track of time. And it's not just me, but my husband and kids too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So far so good no problem at all and you can even add page numbers if you like.  Thanks  for a good product.
630469654X|3.0|Thought there would be more of the Frisian horses in it.<br />It was an interesting movie, though.<br />Had a good &#34;story&#34;
B00BWGL6BS|3.0|This a big disappointment. I've waited four years for a new album by Dido.I've had delete several songs from my Ipod because they have this sudo rap music.
0307474259|5.0|Mr. Taubes has done a thorough job of researching all relevant information on the subject of getting fan and written a remarkable book to present his findings to the layman.
0385349947|1.0|This book is, or going to be, another Oprah best-seller like the hilarious 'The Secret', which was another lie. Just how easy is it to promote yourself having network-power and money before hand, well, she's the epifany of that factum.<br /><br />Of course Sandberg doesn't know what's going on like the rest of us 99% of the world struggling to make it.<br /><br />She is yet another Executive-suit example of the rich and famous 1% liga.<br /><br />If people really want to know how it is out there, they should actually read from a young-blood writer who doesn't use superficial executive networking, and struggles with high qualifications that just don't matter today.<br /><br />'Ove Fn Dittlevson' knows and understands women of today having practising with real victims of personalities, and privileged women like Sandberg, and every one of the writer's book is yet another example of another truth to which Sandberg is a total stranger.<br />The fact that she chased status or money, and not real work, under Facebooks Zuckerberg tells us exactly what kind of person she is and how much BS there is in her book.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I choose this rating because it deserves it. Great characters (characters to love, characters to despise), great story line. I would like to see many mores seasons. Hopefully it can last as long as Gunsmoke!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this as a quick way to sharpen my knives on the go, but I soon realized that it was better than my other sharpeners!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|my 30 year old loves games like this one, especially challenging ones, according to him this is a great game
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Clint eastwood is great, as usual. Justin timberlake and Amy Adams make a nice combo. Movie is fun, funny, and moving.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|very creative format give em credit. also like that there is more than one class.my preffered is a warrior pretty cool.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids love playing this game ans so do I...when I first saw my son playing it I thought how boring, then I tried it and was hooked...it's a plus that it's a nonviolent game for kids to enjoy...my 1 yr old daughter even TRIES to play it
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Just like the rock n roll and the electronic music apps, audio addict brings it to you in jazz. It is worth it. Different channels with different styles. Add your favorites and there you go.
0143038419|5.0|Attended a class that taught mindfulness exercises a couple of years ago and they recommended this book as a source of inspiration, which it certainly is.  I got my copy from the library, but bought this as a present for my Mom, who also loved it.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Season 5 left me hanging badly!  Season 6 did not disappoint.  It was a little more scattered with storylines than previous seasons but it was still catchy and well written.  Supernatural fans will stay fans no matter what!
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|The rock and jazz versions are equally great. This app has all channels listed by type of style and you can pick favorites. With a good connection you have music non stop.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It's a pretty good mouse for gaming.  The extra buttons are helpful for quick actions, etc.  I still haven't fully figured out all of the buttons or button mapping yet.  The weights included give it a nice feel, though.  So far, I like it.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I like the way it organizes music.<br />The only problem is that I can't figure out how to play the Playlist I made.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This story started out as a typical abusive cop and a loving wife whom escapes from his anger. The ending is really a mind blowing, Love the love story and would recommend reading the book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|After all these years, Michael Connelly has become like a cherished uncle, someone trusted to bring home something good. He delivers once again with Harry Bosch's latest adventure. Five stars. If you are a Harry Bosch fan, don't miss this one.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It's a great book there are some sad parts but they get better I recommended it to all you mythology lovers. It has a great cliff hanger hope you enjoy it as much as me
B009X01D9U|5.0|Even though this case is synthetic, it has a very nice quality feel inside and out and is very well constructed. The rotating snap-in frame is ingenious and allows for charging in the stand. Excellent value for the price.
B006MW3VGA|3.0|Buyer beware - the small print claimed that this video would be available on Amazon Instant Video on PS3 and other devices..........it was only after purchasing it that I discovered it can only be DOWNLOADED to your PC or to TiVo (which I don't own)! I'm very upset - I was all set to watch it on my large 65 inch TV set through my PS3 and now I'm stuck watching it on my laptop. AMAZON - PLEASE put a warning up front on videos like this so we don't waste our time and money!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|World at arms is the funnest game I've ever played. You make your own base and it's like a real war. I love it you get to make your army, special weapons, and team.Although I don't like that you need to buy an oil storage center to have a bigger oil meter. But other than that it is the best game I have ever played!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I've been a DM fan since 1989...as I've matured I appreciate different things about their music. I'm always hearing something new within the same songs. Delta Machine has a familiar yet different sound...it's mellow, laid back and introspective. There are some classic sounds from the synth...kind of getting back to their roots. Having listened to it several times in the first 24 hours I've had it there is one thing I'm sure of...I love DM more with every song. I wish Martin had more lead vocals, but I love listening for him in the background. :) True DM fans will not be disappointed.
B005PWPUW6|3.0|I got this to get audio from the optical port on an appletv. I split the output 3.5 mm plug to a headphone amp and small desktop speakers.<br /><br />The sound in my DT880 headphones is 'OK' on most songs, but there is distortion on many. So playing back 44/16 from airplay is not what I was hoping for. The sound to the cheap speakers is fine.<br /><br />Do not expect great sound with this DAC, but it works fine for most sources. Remember, PCM only and only about $25.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|Justin comes thru with some great music. Love the opening track!  Some songs remind me of some older solo music.even the bluegrass cover tunes are ok, give a different feel to the songs. However, he should have left off the I Know You're Out There Somewhere dance remixes. Can't stand them. Would have been five stars otherwise.
1848566190|5.0|I love Drew's work and this book shows you a lot about his process.The forward and insights about the industry are very interesting too.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I have watched almost all 007 movies since Sean Connery was a 007 and none of them can beat Skyfall. Great plot, great action scenes, greater ending. Cant wait to see the next. It was my first purchase from Amazon streaming for videos, usually I only rent, but I wasn't disappointed at all. No breaks and image quality as good as a blu-ray disk.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this new doctor, but Kerry Gillian has sealed the deal with her chemistry and spunk.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Works good. Is a good time eater when waiting at the doctor office. Have sat at home and played for an hour or more also.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This seems like it would be fun although I'm not really into these kind of games.  Challenging and I'll keep it around for something different.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Excellent and understandable writing.  The ending was a bit surprising but considering what the mother and son went through, it makes sense.  However, their pain is gone, but Andrew had to suffer  in the aftermath.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|what this was.  Thought I could get news and entertainment.  Didn't keep it long so I really can't say much.
B000WQW988|5.0|I had the CD for a long time, every time I listen to it, I can feel the emotions in the vocal were overwhelming. After watched few clips from this performance in Youtube, I feel I should own such piece in memory of greatest band.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Almost like reading &#34;ripped from the today's newspaper&#34;.  Clancy catches the spirit of what is going on today and brings it to life, tying the threads together.  This book takes you inside the undercurrents of governments.  The very dark manuevering that you never get from the media.  Excellent writing, spellbinding.  a real page turner.
0385344228|5.0|Compelling.  Amazing story!  It has certainly made me want to read Mr. Landay's other books. With a surprise ending that left me in tears, it certainly will give you plenty to think about, especially if you're a parent.  Please don't miss reading this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app works well, I honestly don't pay attention to what it does, just is informative about how long you have left on your battery and how long you can do it for.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a great game to pass time. There are 2 things I don't like about it. First, it froze my second time playing it and it doesn't have settings. I wanted to listen to my own music and play it but I had to listen to the annoying ringing sound in the game. Other than that it was a fun game.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|it is a bit slow  not true to the book  i liked it but it was difficult to watch and not  finish t  story
0345525558|5.0|If you love a book that has a young girl who has picked herself up from the bottom of the barrel to some one to cheer for, this is your book. I laughed and I did cry buckets. Keep some Kleenex handy
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|This was a great movie!! I had watched it once before and didn't get into it...turned it off after a few minutes...must have not been in the mood. But, I gave it a second look and WOW it is wonderful! One of my all time favorite scary movies...kept me guessing until the end! Good stuff!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Haven't used it enough to give a full review. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game, just like all the temple runs is awesome!!!!!<br />However in this one it is a little harder to see what you are supposed to jump over.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|I( was so very surprised at how good this movie was! I thought it was gonna be another teen horror flick but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! The end is a real surprise too...didn't see it coming! Loved it!
B00280LYIM|5.0|My 9 year old son and I have both read this whole series and we love all of them, this one included. We would both recommend this book to everyone looking for an entertaining book & series to read.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Although I have not yet finished 'Around the World in 80 Days'  I find it a great game to relax and wind down the day playing.
B009NPK1IO|3.0|This was an okay ending to a once great show. It seems they just didn't much care enough about it to give it the ending it deserved.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Great energy, wonderful songs, and an absolutely ALL STAR BAND! And it was recorded at the Ryman Auditorium. Can't get much better. Happy 72nd birthday Ringo, and best wishes for MANY more!
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|This is an easy way to catch up on the news - both financial and regular news - and is very informative.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This is an amazing film. It is extremely funny and a very feel good movie with a nice \\"true\\" story. The performances are very good especially Omar Sy who is phenomenal. Dont let the fact that you have to read this film keep you from seeing it, it is one of the best films I've seen in recent years.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I give this game a five because of the challenging puzzles and the need to think on your feet! It also holds my attention for a long period of time and I have a hard time putting it down.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was just the most amazing book I've read. I cried at the end it was so good. It's worth reading. Charlie is just an amazing character. I've always wondered who he was writing to throughout the story and it will always be my wonder.<br />Love always,<br />Charlie.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|James Bond started out as a sophisticated and suave, charming man. He was able to not only out man his enemies, but also out wit them. He was the ultimate personification of a man, especially back in the 60's when the first film, Dr. No, was made. Obviously, times have changed and so have Bond movies. Gone is the gadgetry. Gone is the subtlety.<br /><br />However, this is a decent action flick. Lots of explosions, a plot that kind of makes sense and doesn't literally just lead from one battle sequence to another needlessly. Daniel Craig does a great job of being this new Bond, as he did in Casino Royale, but that is relatively easy considering all he has to do is work out and not make many facial expressions.<br /><br />Again, this is not a old fashioned James Bond film, and if you were a fan of the Connery, Dalton days, then you might be disappointed. This is the new generation Bond, made for a younger generation in order to re-boot the franchise. Unfortunately, this is just an ok movie, even by action film standards.<br /><br />Personally, I don't mind this new Bond style. If you can get over the symbol that James has come to represent, and simply watch it as an action movie that just so happens to have this guy who bears resemblence to another movie icon, then you can see it as an action film.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I almost gave it a 4 star rating because of the Facebook snafu but it really plays like a 5 star. I didn't expect this level of detail and things to do in a small game. I really enjoy playing it. You can spend real money if you want but can also earn the money slowly, but not so slow that it takes forever. Very unusual to have this much flexibility. The detail of the animation is extraordinary. The only negative I have is I'm using a Kindle Fire and it's not made for it, so I can't use the Facebook link to get friends to help. This is one of the few games I would contact friends to play with me.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Anything you could ever ask for in a movie box set. Comes with a photo book. I love Christopher Nolan's Batman and this trilogy box set does not disappoint.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy this game for many reasons<br />-Great graphics<br />-kid friendly<br />-enjoyable for all ages<br />-easy to learn<br />When I first got the game I was unable to stop playing!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the first of the three and this on just as much.  I can't wait for the third to come out
B0091REZMW|3.0|Seems ok. Not much to look for and hard to understand the tasks. Still playing tho. Still at the beginning of game so not sure how higher levels are.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|you could not beat the price keeps the kids happy they can spend time watching and get entertainedall the time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is a nice game and you would have fun playing this game. Is very attractive when you are a high speed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Since I carry my Kindle everywhere, it's especially handy when I'm shopping. The screen is colorful and numbers/symbols are very easy to read. Like that it keeps you additions faded beneath the total
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Call of Atlantis is a fun Match-3 game. The stages get progressively more challenging and I only found a few truly frustrating (save the &quot;swaps&quot; you earn. You'll need them to get around some walls). Just the right balance of fun and challenge.
B00BF11STU|1.0|After attempting to watch after ordering for over an hour we gave up and did not watch it at all.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Got this app because the little battery icon in the corner wasn't enough for me. This app has a nice graphic to it and gives me an estimate of time remaining for various functions. Nice little app to have.
B00AA36RZY|4.0|Good examples used to explain the patterns, simple and easy to understand. Includes sample code as well as the class diagrams.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|taylor kitsch was awesome in this movie. i'm glad i got it. a must have if your a fan of his.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I &lt;3 this app!<br />X o x o.<br />Awesome game for horse enthusiast.  Lots of fun activities to share with a friend or two.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was half ready to hate this book. But I got totally caught up in the characters and the story...so much so that I had a hard time putting it down!<br />My one niggling complaint is that Holder is WAY to mature and perfect for an 18 year old. But his depth really adds to the story.<br />I will definitely be recommending this book to others.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This was more than I expected. A great deal was delt with various other well known political figures of the times.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great game that improves intelligence and can put a big smile on your  face. A very interesting game a major time killer. Love this game.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This show is the most addictive show I have ever seen. It has great plot twist and wonderful characters that are multidemintional.
B005ORVMCY|5.0|This was the one set I was missing so was just a matter of time until I got it...  Came as expected and had no issues with it...  This is a good purchase for someone who really likes Rush as it's a great set of music - or someone who has never experienced rush as it acts as a compilation as well!  Either way I give it 5 stars!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Worth the time to read.  This is a very nicely assembled compendium that allows you to read Sherlock Holmes in the sequence it was written.  The background information is also instructive for a novice to Holmes like myself.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|WAY TO MUCH LAG... Removing it from my kindle. Not worth it... Not even for free! If a third version of this game came out I wouldnt even consider getting it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved all three books I would recommend this book to women over the age of 30  it is very breathtaking.
B0091REZMW|4.0|mystery. manor is full of quests and adventure. fun for kids and adults too. I recommend it for everyone. 4 stars.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My kids love this game my 12 yo spent all day upgrading the sharks I thought it was ok imfelt the concept was great but they could of done so much more then they did
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is way better than temple run.....its awesome and very addicting. One of the best games that I have yet.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love the eye popping grafics hope they come with updated for this version to enhance the game play like more of a story line or something after a while the game just gets  boring and repetative
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author was able to spin a promising scenario and provide the reader with many options to think over... then the finishing treatment was both anticlimatic and unsatisfying.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I chose this book because I have a close family member with the same addiction that Nikki Sixx has.  It is insightful and interesting to say the least. I like the forum on which it is presented.  Gives me hope that one can survive and rise above and beyond the very nasty and alluring drug heroin.
B00005LK95|5.0|Absolutely wonderful for the kids of any age and was wonderful all over again even though I had seen this movie several times before. Great flick
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This was a very sweet story that examined how people's feelings for each other nurture and grow. You will love this!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Wonderful story line and so imagination catching. Right from the beginning you are swept into the adventure. This story has action, intrique and laughter. The Hobbits, elves, trolls and many others tell an amazing story. Definitely see all the LOTR movies.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Hear Darlene again leading a full album of worship is great, her passion and love for JEsus, made for this album unique! She always carry us in our way in worship and this album capture greater voices.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Yes it is fun but they don't give you enough time. Only 30 sec. The controls are unaccurate. They should let you connect with real friends and race them instead of having to catch up yo computer people.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|great movie,great quality,a great story overall about salah uddin and those times.<br />comparable to gladiator. really captivating. great acting also

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I love all sort of final fantasy games, this is by far the best final fantasy movie, the other ff movie wasn't good
B00A655N8I|2.0|From the moment it was announced, I have waited enthusiastically upon this release. While I would be the first to admit that Gergiev's Ring cycle, as heard at the ROH, was far from perfect, I have been a dedicated admirer of his Parsifal - also released on the Mariinsky label a few years ago. While that may never replace a number of other recordings that I hold and listen to repeatedly, it was certainly a Parsifal that I had happily added to them - for a number of reasons. One of these being that in Parsifal, Gergiev brings forth something new both from the score and text.<br /><br />With this in mind, and a cast that included many of the leading performers of Wagner today - Kaufmann, Pape, Stemme, etc - it seemed that this Walkure would be one of the digital recordings of both this and even the last century. However, I am sad to report that it is not the recording either for which I hoped or indeed it could have been.<br /><br />And the fault? Alas, the blame must lay firmly at the feet of conductor Valery Gergiev. Whereas, with his interpretation of Parsifal he managed to bring many new nuances from Wagner''s score and at the same time produced an \\"exciting\\" performance, with much \\"forward momentum\\" , here he not only fails to do this but instead produces a performance that would be kindly described as \\"restrained\\" and at worse \\"boring\\". - something up-to now I had thought impossible with Walkure. And this is not just to do with any restrained \\"tempos\\". To use a tirade of cliches, it lacks muscle, energy, excitement; while remaining limp, flaccid (why are terms used by music critics when describing the negative always so \\"Freudian\\"?) without any hope of a spark and, to be brutally honest, down-right dull. Even as I type, I am listening to Leb' wohl,. and it is simply \\"underwhelming\\", not even to be saved by the usually magnificent Pape. And this is a section of Walkure that I have rarely, if ever before in a recording, found to be so.<br /><br />The cast work admirably within this structure but not even they can be truly considered to \\"save\\" this recording.<br /><br />It really does sadden me to say so but, despite a \\"stellar\\" cast I would find it difficult to recommend this recording to anyone, especially those new to Wagner in particular.<br /><br />I can only hope that Gergiev may learn from this recording,( although it must be added, many reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it) and he brings more \\"energy\\" to the rest of the Ring<br /><br />Of modern \\"studio\\" recordings, despite their various flaws, I would recommend any of the \\"usual suspects\\" Although my preferred choice of Ring cycles would have to remain the live Bohm from 1966, from whose strong forward momentum and general \\"energy\\" (whether you like the tempos or not is not that relevant) Gergiev could learn much. Parsifal is Parsifal, Walkure is Walkure.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|GREAT!!!! Had these on DVD and wanted to upgrade to Blu-ray and I am glad I did. Great picture and sound and super movies.
B00628RVV0|5.0|The first time I watched this film was with my 10 and 11 year old sons.  At the end, my younger son turned to me and asked, \\"Are they only sad about their son?  What about all the other people?\\" - words from an innocent child who really gets it.  This movie (and the book it was based on) is one of the best stories depicting the Holocaust and its effect on the innocent.  The movie adaptation, with a few minor changes, stays true to the book as it was originally written.  The casting was perfect.  My fifth grade students read the book and then watched the movie.  It really helped them to understand how horrible this time in history was for so many, and how important it is to not allow history to repeat itself.
B005NNV4TU|5.0|What's not to like about Pink Floyd? Great band. Great music. This is the only music with 'singing' that I can work by: it's relaxing and does not break my concentration.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I have a microsoft surface pro and I plugged in the adapter and let it install (about 10-15 seconds) and then I plugged in my internet cord into the adapter and it automatically set up into the network (both home and work networks worked perfectly). I did a speed test in both locations and it is just as fast as directly plugging it into the internet port on a laptop. It also works perfectly when plugged in indirectly through a usb 2.0 hub (after initially setting it up directly), meaning the 4 port USB 2.0 hub plugged into the Surface and then the adapter plugged into one of the 4 USB 2.0 ports and I could still use the other ports for a mouse, printer, etc.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|keeps my budget in line. never had a problem force closin or not working at all. it have never let me down. great little app
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I watched the digital version before the disc arrived. I just don't like the movie; not a good representation of book.<br />Would try to return unopened DVD, but feel like it's cheating.<br />Customer service, shipping, services all great with Amazon. Not your fault the movie is disappointing :)
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I went through the whole thing and I couldn't find what I wanted to. It made me mad. Sorry... Also could you make a dictionary of animals, but not so confusing, because I am the biggest animal lover ever. THANK YOU.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I enjoyed this book, It is more in depth than most love stories. More realistic. both the hero and his love have unhappy, complicated childhoods.  There were times when I had to put the book down because i was getting to involved in their emotions.  I hate getting emotionally in the dumps so if I fear it, I take a break.  There were several breaks in this book. very well written. All's well that ends well.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This movie was very action and exciting it kept you on your feet at all times .Me and my family loved it a whole<br />lot.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|OK, 7 years is a LONG time to wait for an artist to put out their next product, but in this case,<br />it was worth the wait.  I don't know what I expected from this album, but after listening to it<br />twice, I was HOOKED!  I admit there are two songs on the CD that I could have lived without, but<br />for the most part, this album is a winner.  It is absolutely a love tribute to Jessica Biel and<br />while the styles of music may be different for each song, the lyrics all reflect a totally love<br />struck JT... and it's fabulous.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that the songs could have been 'tighter' and<br />trimmed in their length, but all in all, the songs wouldn't be the same if they had been trimmed<br />to shorter versions.  And Blue Ocean Floor was a total and complete surprise.  It isn't anything<br />at all like the other songs, but seems an absolute perfect fit to end the CD.  It is a beautiful<br />song that showcases Justin's voice in its purest form... while all the other songs have been so<br />'worked', this one just flows and feels like a musical wave.<br /><br />If you like JT, you'll love this album (yes, I still call CD's albums!!!)  I'm no expert on music<br />to say what is R&B, hip hop, techno, etc.  I just know what I love when it comes to<br />sound and this album was NOT disappointing.  \\"Mirrors\\" is one of the most beautiful love songs<br />I've ever heard.

B007THA4FI|3.0|Well written, but way too depressing. I dreaded reading it. I don't read books to feel bad. I was a huge Harry Potter fan. Those books made me want to live the fantasy and feel good. I would hate living with the people and in the places in this book. There wasn't a character that I liked as a person. They were all sad people and some down right hateful. I need a hero.
B003MXGNX0|2.0|I feel like the movie was made with the mindset, When you don't know what to do either blow something up or kill off a major character. I liked the first two better...

1616550414|5.0|As soon as somebody showed me their copy of this book I knew I had to buy it.  As an avid Zelda fan, this is a great source to see the thought process on how to create my beloved games.  As an artist I appreciate seeing all the notes on the character designs etc. that came to populate the world of the Zelda games.
B004HY9NKI|2.0|Poorly made/low production quality/unbelievable characters. Watch only if you enjoy gratuitous violence and actors who are over the hill and don't care about their performances.

B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This movie explores the humanity of people with disabilities. Too many people that do not suffer from disabilities, whether physical or developmental, feel that the disabled are without &#34;normal&#34; human emotions and desires. Nothing can be further from the truth. In the movie, based on an article written by a disabled man, we see caretakers both compassionate and mean-spirited. The main focus, however, is on the interaction between this man and a sex surrogate who helps him achieve the goal of engaging in sexual activity despite his physical limitations. Threaded through this tapestry of a story are the frank and open discussions between this disabled yet religious man and the local parish priest which provide some of the movie's lighter moments.<br />If not for the nudity, which is integral to the telling of the story, this movie should be required viewing for everyone past elementary school age.

B005LAII44|3.0|Wow, that's one helluva timing, Paramount! The release of this action sequel actually coincides with North Korea declaring war on the South and the US, threatening the \\"imperial\\" west with nuclear annhiliation. Too bad, the G.I. Joes don't exist in real life, for they could have easily disarmed Mr. Kim within five minutes of screentime. That's exactly what's being depicted regarding the Pakistani atomic weapons and this is only one the various reasons this flick is too over-the-top and self-righteous for its own good.<br /><br />Tangling serious and very topical issues like terrorism, nuclear disarmament and mass destructive weapons in such a perfunctory way perfectly illustrates what's wrong with modern-day Hollywood blockbusters. The action's for action's sake, the threat, and be it millions of deaths, is abused as a tool to entertain popcorn-munching audiences who have deliberately switched off their higher brain functions at the entrance.<br /><br />It's been done countless of times before in action flicks, comic book movies etc. But as long as it's only about giant roving robots from outer space blowing up alien planets, that's fine with me. But it stops being funny when it's about real-life nuclear threats...pocking fun at North Korea (\\"Yeah, we can annhiliate you 15 times, not 14!\\") and Pakistan, blowing up London without serving any real  purpose...it's dull, bland, lukewarm and shows a lack of any compassion and empathy for the upcoming victims of real-life nuclear disasters. I really feel bad for all those who might die in...come what may...<br /><br />I kinda feel reminded of that pilot episode of \\"The Lone Gunmen\\", the X-Files spin-off that somewhat predicted 9/11. Is it going to happen again? Hopefully not, but it's either brilliant or excruciatingly bad timing, bringing out this turd of a movie right now at the brink of nuclear disaster in Korea.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's very fun and entertaining. i would recomend this game to any horse lover. it also has very good graphics.
B001KM7DES|1.0|This review has less to do with the film itself, then the worthless format that has been imposed upon me. I have recently taken the Betamax VCR as a hobby, and have been looking for favorite films in that format. This was listed as a beta tape, but is a genaric old VHS, not worth 50 cents! I have been misled, and I demand a refund!
B00285K1KE|1.0|My family loves to watch the marvel comics movies, but this is the worst we have ever seen.  They tried to make the film like a comic strip with multiple panes/video at the same time.  Extremely confusing and poorly done!  The special effects stunk for a movie of this caliber.  Don't wast your money!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Overall I liked this movie.  I am a big Tolkien fan and have read all the books, (Hobbit, Lord of the Rings trilogy, Silmarillion, History of Middle Earth, unfinished tales, etc).  While this movie is well made, and has a few very good parts, it is quite slow moving along.  While I appreciate the added material from the various books and stories that support the Hobbit story,  I wish they had chosen to move the movie story line along instead of stretching it out over 3 installments.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Why? Why would you do this to us! Why do you HATE us Rick Riordan? Ok... I'll try to control myself from now on. This is a great book, a fantastic read that keeps you on your toes. It has romance, wit, and a HUGE cliff hanger. I would suggest this book to any and every one. Just beware I cried at the end of this book. It has a literal cliff hanger, that's all I'm going to say. I don't want to be a spoiler I just want you to know what you're getting into...  the only thing keeping me together right now is that Rick knows that if anything happens to... them... well it will not be good. Do you hear me Rick? You will lose all of your fan base. Just keep it in mind Riordan... just keep it in mind. Think about it. Is it worth it?

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen the production on stage 5 times.  I have 5 other versions on tape, none of which are good.  This production was fantistic in the theater, and I could not wait to get my own copy.  I recommend it to everyone.  Deserves more than 5 stars.

B0055OG2BC|4.0|It's a fun look back and a send-up of all James Bond movies. Woody Allen makes the best Bond villain ever!
B000Q76K1A|1.0|This is a great movie, and since it has been out for over a decade, I assume you know that, but Amazon has a &#34;known issue that we are currently working to resolve&#34; that make it impossible to watch this great movie.  The movie doesn't appear in My Video Library and I am supposed to wait 3+ hours for it to appear.  I don't plan on waiting up the rest of the night to watch this movie, so I asked for a return.  Denied.  I must wait 3 hours.  Bah! Don't waste your money using Amazon.

1416972250|4.0|This is the third in the Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. Like the two before it, it was fast-paced, high-stakes and beautifully written. Clare departed in her presenting of the villain, though, by show us the readers some connections that she withheld from the characters. You know those moments where you're yelling at the book (or TV screen) \\"C'mon, idiot! It's THAT GUY!\\" but of course their blissfully ignorant? Yep, it was like that.<br /><br />That's not to say I didn't love it...I did, it just contained fewer \\"Wha...?!\\" surprises and more eyebrow quirking, for me. The book wrapped up beautifully, closing some over-arcing conflicts and answering some questions, but being open-ended enough for my imagination.<br /><br />Which is odd, because there's a fourth and fifth book out...and I love the characters but don't feel there's any conflict to take me into Book Four. I'm going to read it, of course, but I'm a wee bit skeptical.<br /><br />So what can I tell you about City of Glass? Not much, without ruining plot points that thread through City of Bones and City of Ashes. Are your favorite folks in it, being totally themselves? Yes. And there are a few news folks. Does it have an epic scene with Isabelle where I literally cheered out loud while reading? Yes. Does it contain some shocking and heartbreaking scenes as well? Of course.<br /><br />I recommend this book for fans of City of Bones and City of Ashes, of course. You'll love this series if you're into plot-and-character-strong works, female protagonists, heroes that work as a team instead of as lone wolves, grown-up/older level YA fiction, fantasy, romantic tension, believable baddies, and quirky wit.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I thought it was a story worth telling told in a compelling manner. The story really reflects the difficult decisions that are often made in the name of security and defense.
1416955070|5.0|I picked up this book (actually, all 3 books in the series) because I'd heard so much about it. Also, this first book is being made into a movie, released in August of this year. Also, two of my favorite YA authors (Libba Bray and Holly Black) sung its praises on the back cover.<br /><br />So, OK, consider me part of the Cassandra Clare fan club now.<br /><br />This book did everything right: the suspense was active, but not exhausting; the romances were believable and complicated; the characters (oh my gods, the characters) were real and fleshed-out with their own strengths and weaknesses and adaptability (if it's one thing I hate, in any genre of book, it's when characters are used as tools instead of treated as changeable, flawed, believable people); the world is colorful and fun; the wit abounds; the twists actually did surprise me.<br /><br />I got about halfway through before I reached the \\"I can't put this book down\\" parts, so stick with it. Clary, the main character, is fantastic. She's a little naive, but not unrealistically so, and her blind spots come into question not as plot device tools, but in self-analytical moments where she questions and grows.<br /><br />I am starting the second book on the heels of this one, because there's still so much to find and do. And if I can't be wielding seraph blades (well, I'd choose the bow and arrows, obviously) alongside Isabelle and Alec and Jace and Clary and Simon (oh, Simon), at least I can read about their adventures.<br /><br />I recommend this book for fans of well-written YA, adventure and action fans, folks who enjoy a dash of fantasy and mythology in their modern-day fiction, those who enjoy great characterization, fans of kick-butt heroines, those who enjoy romance that doesn't fall into the typical overdone book tropes, and pretty much everyone.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|OK, really heavy going and pages and pages of 1-sentence pages that really, you can speed read over as it gets too detailed and lengthy,  and not essential to the overall plot, really,<br />A heap of what I considered superfluous wordage.<br /><br />But, the last 20% was in fact quite riveting..and flowed nicely.<br />Glad I read it, glad I made it through the quagmires in the early parts.<br />A good 'pick up and put down' sort of book, reading a regular dose each day!<br />Good stuff
1416972242|5.0|I loved City of Bones so much, I had to pick up the sequel, City of Ashes. And it did not disappoint my expectations! Once again, Cassandra Clare has woven a thrill-ride of a mystery, with twists and turns and suspense and characters you want to be/know/date/etc. Well, maybe not date. They are complicated.<br /><br />This is not the kind of sequel where everything stays like it was in the first book, and we just re-visit it. A couple of the characters take more of a backseat to the story and other characters in this book, and we're introduced to a few new characters. The over-arcing problems are still there, and are developed and delved into a bit more.<br /><br />To be honest, I found the villain more creepy and real in City of Ashes than in the first book. It takes a lot for me to believe a villain is a real threat to the characters that I love, and Cassandra Clare pulls no punches in this respect. She also developed the characters more (which contributed to the constant tension in the story) and has once again left them with places to go and things to do.<br /><br />I want to note that this series, thus far, relies heavily on teamwork to get the quest done. And ever since seeing this TedTalk [...], I've started paying attention to that (rare) trope, as I agree about it encouraging our youth in the right direction.<br />That's part of what appeals to me about it- Clary isn't out there being kick-butt by her lonesome: sometimes she's cowering in the corner in fear. And that's OK. It's understandable. It's believable. And it makes me feel like I could be the heroine, too.<br /><br />I recommend this book for fans of City of Bones, those who enjoy a strong female character, romantic tension, love triangles, well-developed characters, the struggle between right actions and law/establishment, and those who enjoy fantasy. But read the first book before you read this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Me parece una excelente aplicaci&oacute;n, es super &uacute;til, muy visual y pr&aacute;ctica. La recomiendo para todas las edades. Espero les sea de mucha utilidad.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The critics have decided, some of them, to be harsh on this film. If you enjoy the story then the length of the movie is no worry, many of us would have preferred it was longer. The hobbit may not be a particularly long story,I would be fine if they split it into 6 movies. With all the absolute garbage out there, the 87th remake of Spider Man, and the recycling of the same movies and story lines this is an absolute gem, keep them coming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great fun and very addictive,good for all ages, my 5 year old cousin loves it too. Controls are similar to temple run, so easy to do.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Among all of the seasons of LOST, this one, season 4, shows what we have been waiting for since the beginning, and it is absolutely thrilling. I am totally in love with this series, and I highly recommend this season as well as all of the others!

B000P6YNSE|5.0|I absolutely love this series! LOST is one to watch! Even though the other seasons of LOST show more promise and mystery, the overall basis of the show means complete and utter love for all of them. I highly recommend this series and season.
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|amazon sucks!  just go to the store or get it from Netflix.  Once you pay to watch it, it will be in crappy resolution no matter what you watch it on, and after so many episodes, it will just crap out on you and tell you that the &#34;page is unavailable on our website&#34;.  Great series, watch it on tv or elsewhere, but don't give amazon your money!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It's a great experience and the horse actually becomes an entity the more you train and nurture it.  It's for horse owner wannabes

B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is a wonderful game with a variety of difficulty. I liked it so much, I installed it on my phone. Thank you.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Good movie,for all members of family. But the download or connection was not good,so the movie was not really great in watching, more interruptions,stops and distortions. However, the story of movie is very good for everyone,which is about the vampire and his daughter on new,adventure and different world. It's about the love from all parents with fear on their children to be themselves,growing up and taking new step into the world psychologically. A lesson of learning from parent,children and all ages in all times from all family. So, this is a good movie.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game was fun... graphics were good... ambient sounds and background noises were a nice touch... glad for the zoom ability in the hidden object scenes
B006LSZECO|3.0|Long and contrived<br /><br />I found it repetitious and it didn't move along.  Too much detail that made the story unbelievable.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|I mean its i great game. I watched gameplays in stuff but i never got to play it cause of the price. Lol my parents so cheap right them cant buy this game for $6.99 i really sad :(
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sparks is an amazing author and this book was no exception.<br />It was just too predictable for me.  It was still a good read though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A very fun app. I'm very glad they made the sequel, but I personally think the graphics are a bit lower in quality, like the floating powerups and Guy Dangerous himself. Although harder and more confusing than the first, Temple Run 2 is a must have!
B003O86FMW|5.0|You will never see it coming, every detail is so important it must be a mind twister to anyone who read it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Sparks has a talent of appealing to women of all circumstance.  is was a story of escaping abuse and overcoming ones own fears.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|So finally I got my copy & damn Glad I did ...The BEST music ever. The game is so epic & the sound track was cool, so I reallllllllllllllly love this one . if there was 10 star I would blindly give to it .

B004JZBGWI|5.0|than sticky notes all over my desk; that's for sure!  I'd like to be able to transfer my tasks from one note to another, instead of deleting from a note and re-writing to another.<br />I like the ability to cross out - without having to delete - tasks so that I can see what got done.  I can un-cross tasks out, too, which is great for tasks that need repeating (grocery list).<br />Get this!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I'd give 5 stars except there were a few tiny touch-screen issues - objects that didn't respond unless you hit it just so. But otherwise a nice long winding game with great graphics and fun spooky plot line.
0679729895|5.0|I decided to forgo reading the 900 page volume of all of Roald Dahl's short stories and purchase a smaller collection to make sure I actually liked them first. And I did. Tales of the Unexpected is full of just that - tales with so many unexpected events. This is Roald Dahl at his morbid best. His children's books may be morbid, but they're nothing in comparison to his adult short stories. I particularly liked \\"Lamb to the Slaughter\\"; it was funny in a bleak sort of way. \\"Man From the South\\" is of course, genius. It's about a ridiculous bet that happens. \\"Taste\\" also deals with a huge, and plain foolish, bet. \\"Dip in the Pool\\" was really good too. There were more that I loved, but it would take too long to list them here. But Roald Dahl is a genius. In about 10 pages, he manages to make you drawn into the story, makes you feel chilled, and makes you gasp. All of the stories take place in the ordinary world, but what lurks beneath it is stunningly portrayed. Human nature is laid bare, events are laid bare, and Dahl draws heavily from his own childhood experiences in many of the stories.<br /><br />The stories also never end in anything definitive; Dahl gives just enough of a conclusion to keep you wonder and guessing and thinking. In \\"Nunc Dimittis\\" for example, the ending is such a teaser. The story itself is wonderful, and at the end, you think you know what happened, but you can't be 100 % sure. Roald Dahl's tales really are unexpected; there were many instances when the story took a twist that I was shocked by, a twist that I hadn't expected at all. And that makes the stories all the more delicious. They're aptly named, that's for sure, and I loved them.<br /><br />I don't know if I have a specific favorite story; they were all really good, and all really chilling and effective. Some of them were perhaps a bit too effective. \\"Parson's Pleasure\\" for example had me literally gasping out loud at the end. No, gasping isn't the right word; more like, exclaiming. It was just so...evil, the ending. I could almost hear Roald Dahl laughing as he wrote it.<br /><br />Often (but not always), Roald Dahl writes from the first person, but the narrator is a witness to the events. \\"Man From the South\\", one of his most famous and chilling stories is narrated by someone who witnesses the sinister bet that takes place. They're not actually a main character in the events, but they just happen to see it all. However, not all of his stories are told like that.<br /><br />I really, really loved this collection of stories, and Roald Dahl was really a genius writer. I've been reading a lot of morbid fiction lately (mostly Roald Dahl), so I think I might take a break and read something lighter. Still, I would highly recommend this one.<br /><br />My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com.s just so...evil, the ending.

1250000971|4.0|The first in a series of 3(?) books,&#34;Only Time Will Tell&#34;, provides the historical perspective that is the basis for the second book in the series.  Series books published by many authors can easily be read as a individual story.  Based on reading &#34;Only Time Will Tell&#34; and &#34;The Sins of the Father&#34; I recommend that readers begin with the first in the series and read them in order.  For example, the connections made in the first book are not reviewed in the second book and unlike many series...the background connections do make a difference as you move through the series.<br />The organization of the book is different from the set-up of most books.  But, once the reader understands how the story will be structured it is easy to follow.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved the premise of a drunken Vegas wedding maybe turning some real.  Kind of like Whyat happens in Vegas, but sweeter.  Would have loved a sequel giving more about where their lives went after the book.  Great, quick romantic comedy!

B0053KWDES|5.0|I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that needs a sound boost. I use an iPhone 4 which lacks volume or an equalizer function. I did my research on this product mostly by reading the positive/negative reviews on amazon and concluded that I would give this item a shot. Boy am I glad I did. The difference is night and day. I use mine with and iPhone 4 and the Bose QC15s and the results just blow me away. It is like I'm sitting front stage at a concert. I do not know how I went for so long without an amplifier. I am glad that I chose this one. I almost bought the custom Altoids tin can one you can find via ebay since those also got pretty good reviews, but I was looking for something more compact and super light. This unit works perfect for my rig. Anyway, I will definitely stand behind this product 100%. You can also replace the lithium-ion battery if the unit ever goes completely dead which means you can keep this going for the life of the device. Just quit deciding and buy it already. :)
B002RTBN9O|1.0|I cannot believe that this stilted, awkward, unrealistic tird ever made it to the big screen or how the ratings for this thing could be so relatively high?  The dialogue is impossibly immature, the plot has holes a fiery zeppelin could fly through and the underlying philosophy is plainly stupid.  I can't imagine the actors going along with this thing without busting into a Howard Roark-like temper tantrum over how no one speaks that way nor could anyone make the dialogue, the plot, or any of the atrocious non-human relationships sound even remotely plausible.<br /><br />There are elements of the plot that I can find appealing such as the social commentary about the world being unappreciative of talent but this movie is the epitome of all that is true in that statement.<br /><br />Did I mention how smelly this thing is?<br /><br />Great googly moogly, it's an unprecedented train wreck.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|BEST BOOK YET!!!!!!!!!!! She needs to make a second book!!!!!! If i read a better book than this one, its gotta be EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!Make a sequel R.J Palacio!  Once it is read you will become a new person. I think the moral of this story is treat others the way you want to be treated. Wonder by R.J Palacio and The One and Only Ivan by Kathrine Applegate has a huge competition!!!!!!! This could be the next To Kill a Mockingbird.
0385737955|5.0|If you've already read the series and are just looking for reviews to read, I have also written a lengthy review of Book 2: The Scorch Trails!<br /><br />BUT, now I will be reviewing \\"The Maze Runner.\\" I picked up this book a few weeks ago, after seeing it in the local bookstore and advertised as a best seller. I had seen the title before, and the eye-catching cover, and finally read it.<br /><br />It was slow to progress for me, despite the very suspenseful and mysterious opening. I ended up reading a few chapters and then not reading it again for about a week. I saw it sitting on my nightstand and thought, \\"Well, i should probably finish it!\\" So, I did.<br /><br />The plot sped up nicely, and by the end I was completely submerged.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed that readers dislike are the seemingly \\"weak characters.\\" I think this is one reason why I didn't get into the book right away. Thomas, Dashner's protagonist, is a confused teen entering the chaotic world of the Glade. If I remember correctly, no physical description is offered for Thomas in the first book. Maybe... I don't seem to remember reading what he looked like. But believe me, I ended up LOVING Thomas. He's a pretty cool kid.<br /><br />Anyway, to me physical description is usually a big connector to readers; the better they can see a character, the better they will connect with them and see them as REAL. However, a few of the other Gladers are described for readers, like Minho and Alby and Chuck. The only other character who i couldn't SEE was Newt -- what does he even look like? {Spoiler, i never found out till Book 2, \\"The Scorch Trails,\\" unless I really wasn't paying attention}.<br /><br />Despite the lack of description, I feel that Dashner's characters are still memorable, and my imagination fills in the details that I found missing.  Chuck, the somewhat annoying younger boy who befriends Thomas from day 1, is easy to distinguish, and easily becomes a main sub-character in Book 1.<br /><br />Now on to plot {spoiler alert ahead, for those of you who have not yet read the book}; the entire first book takes place in the Maze, except for the ending. This, to me, is a bit stifling, but I understand that this is the point; they are trapped in an impossible Maze and looking for a way out. So I can easily overlook this. This does make it less exciting than the next two books in the series, though. But everyone needs to start somewhere!<br /><br />One major thing that annoyed me slightly was when {spoilers} Thomas first arrived in the Glade, with his memory wiped, and he is super confused. He asks a billion questions that deserve answers right away, but Alby and Newt and Chuck all refuse to give him any answers until \\"the time is right.\\" I suppose as a readers I wanted answers badly too... that's why I was a bit frustrated. Otherwise, this book is paced just fine.<br /><br />OK, now for the Grievers. {Spoilers} - Grievers are the monster-like creatures that roam through the maze at night, and that kill and \\"sting\\" anyone who crosses their paths. I won't get into all the details, but this was one concept I found hard to grasp. At first I was like, \\"What? They have stingers, spikes, and mechanical arms all coming out of their bodies? And they roll? And their skin is jelly-like?\\" It was kinda random, if not a strange pairing of limbs and aspects. After the first book, though, I remembered them more easily. There are countless battles with Grievers in the first book, so they are NOT easy to forget.<br /><br />Other comments: I just have to get this out; I absolutely adore Dashner's use of sarcasm. He does lay it on thick sometimes, but I found myself laughing often at his character's dialogue.<br /><br />Finally, to wrap it up, I'll just say that if you have read this, you NEED to move on to Book 2, which was the BEST book in the series BY FAR. Please. Do it.<br /><br />If you have NOT read this series, and are debating on whether or not you should, go ahead andread them! If you like dystopian novels, then yes, definitely. This series turned out to be much more complex than I could ever have imagined -- there are many secrets that readers to not unveil until the very last page of Book 3, \\"The Death Cure.\\"<br /><br />Overall a great series and great First book. Not as great as the next two, but still very, very good.read them! If you like dystopian novels, then yes, definitely.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so much fun! There are unlimited possibilities and you can create tons of worlds, connect with other players who are on the same server, and copy their world to your device! SO MUCH FUN! WORTH THE SEVEN BUCKS!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The movie is fun, fast, and full of video game culture references, but everyone knows that. Under the candy-coated veneer is an emotional story about self-worth, friendship, and empathy. The characters are loveable, the animation is excellent, and the J-pop and dubstep soundtrack is actually enjoyable and fun. While it is rated PG, I didn't find it scary or inappropriate, but you should probably preview it before showing it to any really little ones just in case your tastes differ. My family loves it, it's our kid movie du jour.
B003O86FMW|5.0|intense moments in the book kept me wanting more. the ending was brilliant! absolutely, positively brilliant! i definitely recommend this.
6304884419|4.0|I believe that this is actually one of Deniro's better movies. This tells a story about a kid growing up in the Bronx; around gansters and how doing gangster stuff changed him as he grew up. This is a really good movie.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|you wouldnt know what comes next. jamie really knows how extract that distinct, unique, human emotion....makes you want to cry, shout, smile.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was slow to get into but about halfway in I couldn't stop. Very good book and I will recommend to anyone.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Compared to the first book, this one kind of wanders off and gets a bit lost.  Still has some fine writing though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game super addicting u must try it ...esp fun with a stylus everyone ive let play loves it as well
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was well written, and suspenseful, but it reached no conclusion in the end.  I expected relief for Nick, vindication, a happy life, but not to be.
B00BON8072|5.0|I chose Rebecca because I  lost my hard copy that I read at least once a year.. for many years. Love reading it and recommend  it  highly. Like Gone with the wind, Grapes of wrath, and Of human bondage they never get old.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A roller coaster ride. A very different world. Claustrophobic. You will really care about the heroine. Lots of future potential stories in this universe.
B005Z271Y6|4.0|This is a great blu ray DVD. It is better than being live in concert caused I can save the plane ticket and the concert fee and still be able to enjoy it at the comfort of my living room.
1444765426|5.0|I liked this book due to its simple but powerful message--it cuts right to the actions needed to be successful at time management
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|She loves MH she watches it all the time. I really liked it has Spanish language and english subtitles. I will look for more DVD's
B002BWQ6H6|3.0|This book started strong but then lost my interest. Too much narration and too little plot. The convention of trying to tie the various stories together through the tight rope walker is over-wrought. Some brilliant moments, just too uneven for me.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|\\"The Best Damn Thing\\", Avril Lavigne's third album, is one of the best pop-rock albums of 2007.  It's short and sweet, at 12 tracks and 40 minutes.  The album is irresistible from start to finish.  The tunes are always lighthearted and mostly peppy. Avril's usual feisty attitude makes them even more irresistible.  This album's lighthearted nature is a contrast of the music on Lavigne's (excellent) second album \\"Under My Skin\\", which was dark and poetic.<br /><br />Almost every track concerns young love.  My favorite tracks on the album are \\"Girlfriend\\", \\"I Can Do Better\\", \\"When You're Gone\\", \\"Hot\\", \\"I Don't Have To Try\\", \\"One Of Those Girls\\", and \\"Keep Holding On\\". \\"Girlfriend\\", \\"I Can Do Better\\", \\"I Don't Have To Try\\", and \\"One Of Those Girls\\" are among the tracks that have a `bubblegum punk' sound. They are fast, simple songs packed with attitude but playful, not angry.  They are as catchy as anything Britney Spears has done; as loud anything blink 182 has done. \\"I Can Do Better\\" is about not changing to meet a boyfriend's standards.  \\"Girlfriend\\" is about the desire to be the girlfriend of someone's who's already taken.  \\"I Don't Have To Try\\" is about `wearing the pants' in the relationship, despite being a girl.  \\"One Of Those Girls\\" is the story of another girl who frequently jumps from one partner to the next.<br /><br />\\"Hot\\" has an upbeat power-pop sound. It shows less of Avril's attitude and expresses the joy found from a boyfriend. \\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Keep Holding On\\" (from the movie Eragon) are among the few melancholy moments of the album. These are beautiful ballads that show Avril's powerful voice and ability to pour our heartfelt emotion when needed (which she does well).<br /><br />\\"The Best Damn Thing\\" is a must-hear for anybody who enjoys peppy music, or pop-rock music in general.<br /><br />(4.50 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano (03/29/2013)
0385333846|3.0|I read this book many years ago but unfortunately I lost the copy I had.  This reprint is badly printed, a very inferior copy.  But the story (bombing of Dresden in WWII), like all Kurt Vonegut´s novels, is brilliant!  For those who haven´t read it, its a must!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Love It<br />Haughty by chauvinism huh vgbhnjbhhbhb high B-) hub B-) u by v uhh th vg guru v/ t.v.
067941715X|5.0|I adore Jane Austen and have all her books but Northanger Abbey and a few others were not from the Everyman collection.  I just wanted a quality book rather than a paperback so I treated myself.  Now I get to reread it.  Bliss in a good binding.
1401937519|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a great reminder that there is more than this physical plane.<br />A must read for anyone who is fearful of dying.
0679412697|5.0|My book club is reading Pride and Prejudice and my well read copy is from the 1970's and was a cheap paperback then.  I decided to upgrade to the Everyman to match 3 other Austen books I had in that binding.  Well, might as well upgrade them all and get a good excuse to reread them.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|With all the rave reviews of the movie I expected this to be one fantastic read. It wasn't. It was just OK.
0679405429|5.0|Who doesn't love Pride and Prejudice?  It is a Law I think that every woman reads it!  And why have a crappy paperback when you can have a nice edition.  Go for it!
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Loved this movie, I remember it so well from my childhood - great to find it on DVD still in the plastic :)<br /><br />Poor Casper.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great activity for kids to engage in.  It gives creative ideas for cooking, working out, and decorating.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I am not a book reviewer but I simply have to say that this is a lovely story about renewal late in life.  The novel is beautifully crafted leading you through the journey of self-discovery in two older people long past the time in life when self-knowledge is a topic.  It was well told, sensitive but also engaging.  Well worth the read.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher Novels. I will read them as long as Lee Child continues to write them. Keep them coming
B007CGNOAI|4.0|Very thought provoking! It was disturbing yet heartening; there are so many educators that are trying to help kids in a system that discourages it.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Not as good as the first one. I do not know I will read another, but I understand they are all different in plot and lay out.
