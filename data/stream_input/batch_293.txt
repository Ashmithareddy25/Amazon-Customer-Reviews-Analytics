0385508417|5.0|Skipping Christmas was a fast moving and VERY(I can agree with that)kind of book.It tells how &quot;off&quot; everyone goes at Christmas,and how exasperating it can be in a humorous and truthful way.From spending to much for no reason to stepping in sloshy snow up to your knees!
B000088E6D|5.0|An outstanding collection of music and Buble is a wonderful surprise....do we hear a Torme hear and there?? Hope we can expect the next CD VERY soon..maybe with a little Misty and The Nearness of You?  Whatever, it's bound to be just what we want...please keep it that way.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I wasn't really a No Doubt fan untill after I got this album, but since I've gotten it, it has become one of my favorite CDs. These songs are just AWESOME! There isn't one song on this CD that I don't like, because all of them are just wonderful. My favorite songs are &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Underneath it All', &quot;In My Head&quot;, and &quot;Platnium Blond Life&quot;. A fantastic CD, with tons of songs you can totally get up and dance too. This CD deserves at least ten stars!
0679721037|5.0|Very good book. I also have enjoyed the audiobook.<BR>It's non fiction, so it's not for pure entertainment, but for people who really want to see the unvarnished truth of what happened.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I really liked the singles I heard off the radio from Pink's new album, so I was extremely excited when I got it. This album is very much like a journey into Pink's past, with songs like \\"Family Portrait\\", \\"Dear Diary\\", and \\"My Vietnam. I like most of the songs, which include \\"Lonely Girl\\", \\"My Vietnam\\", (though I know Pink can write better songs than that!) \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\", and \\"Get the Party Started\\". Some songs did get annoying because Pink sounded very whiny. If I had to choose, the best song would be \\"Get the Party Started\\", and \\"Misery\\" would get the trophy for worst song on Missundaztood. Mostly a terrific album, and many people will love it!
B00005JLRR|3.0|This movie is it's own worst enemy. As an avid Star Trek fan of over 30 years, I was very much looking forward to this movie. Now, I wonder why. The cast looked old, tired and just plain done. There were scenes of dialoge that just seemed to wonder on forever and at times I found myself thinking...jeeez can we move on now. The battle scenes are impressive however and the Enterprise-E gets a good workout. If your an avid Star Trek fan, Nemesis is a must to complete your movie collection. If your just a regular sci-fi fan, find something better to spend your money on.
0399103422|5.0|What more can I say? This book has everything needed for a successful story: crime, suspense, sex, love, revenge, and New York City. Puzo is a genius. \\"The Godfather\\" will always remain one of my all-time favorite novels. Highly recommended. The book is even better than the films.
6303471730|5.0|A good western serious but enjoyable,light comedy. JOHN WAYNE being the big he bull of the movie as useual,enjoyable.
0399103422|5.0|What more can I say? \\"The Godfather\\" has everything needed for an excellent novel: crime, love, suspense, sex, revenge, and New York City. Plus, Puzo's crafting of the story is remarkable. The films are good, but the book is excellent. It will always be among my all-time favorite novels. Highly recommended.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams' stunning composition is clearly demonstrated with this soundtrack. Highly recommended for any Harry Potter or Williams fan.
B00005JLO2|3.0|To call THE FOUR FEATHERS in line with such epics as BRAVEHEART and THE ENGLISH PATIENT (as the back cover says it is) is quite far-fetched. To call THE FOUR FEATHERS a good runner-up is much more appropriate. <br />Let's start off with the good things first:<br />-THE PACING is incredible. This movie sweeps you from formal England to the beautiful and deadly Sudan within a half-hour. The transition is extremely well done and really gets the story moving.<BR>-THE CINEMETOGRAPHY is marvelous. It's obviously Lawrence of Arabia inspired, but then again, what ISN'T inspired from Lawrence of Arabia? <BR>-THE ACTION is great. There are a few little gunfights, but there's a massive 13 minute battle sequence that is very well choreographed and executed. In one word: AMAZING.<BR>-THE MUSIC is wonderful. Although it starts off a bit bland, it really kicks in to the sweeping main theme once the film trasnports you to the Sudan. James Horner really did a great job. <BR>-THE ACTING is pretty good. Wes Bentley delivers a great performance, as does Heath Ledger. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Heath Ledger and Djimon Hounsou is great.<BR>-THE RATING. While not quite strong enough to be an R, it does teeter on the edge and shows you everything within the limits of PG-13. There is swordplay/stabbings, massive gun battles, whippings, beatings, killings, and more. (They are all muted, though.) To me, this helps the movie a lot by having a sense of realism but not being TOO realistic. (Like BRAVEHEART)<br />And now, the not-so-good things:<br />-IT SLOWS DOWN too much in the last act and the edning is very choppy. This is where the film really suffers. After escaping from prison, all of a sudden (one second later in screen time) Heath's character is back in England. Then, there is a long and tedious scene between Heath Ledger and Kate Hudson. Also, the movie ends not really telling you who gets Kate Hudson's character.<BR>-THE SCRIPT is mostly good, but bland in some spots. For example, in the scene I mentioned earlier with Kate Hudson and Heath Ledger talking at the end of the movie, the dialouge is really bland. There are other scenes, too.<BR>-IT ENDS TOO SOON. By the end, this movie has tried so hard to be an epic with its rousing score, great action, well-done drama, etc., and it leaves you at the credits after 130 minutes. Now usually, 130 minutes is fairly long, but not for a movie of this sort of scope and historical arc. It doesn't play out long enough to leave a real impression in most people. <br />Anyway, don't get me wrong. This is a great movie. But just imagined what it COULD'VE BEEN if it were 30 minutes longer and  had the script and the very last act touched up a tiny bit.<br />2002; Rated PG-13 for an intense fights and battle scenes, violence, disturbing images, and sensuality
0312305060|1.0|No, I haven't read Virginia Woolfe.  Why should I have to?  Michael Cunningham's book should stand on it's own, and for me it doesn't.  I was suckered by the old Hollywood bait and switch when I bought the book, The Hours.  Michael Conningham's book is a Pulitzer Prize winner after all.  And the movie has recieved high praise from Hollywood.  Oh, I forgot...from Hollywood.  What was I thinking.  I could just be imagining this, but I think book and movie promoters alike realize that the majority of people would not by choice choose a book or movie with a strong homosexual theme; therefore, to get us to lay out the money they talk it up big and keep the wool pulled over our eyes long enough for us to buy the book or the movie ticket... These agenda propagators must feel it is their duty to enlighten us (about what I don't know), but I feel more like I am having something shoved down my throat.  Hey, what ever happened to free choice...before I pay the money?  No, that's too much to ask...they would loose too much money and have to start promoting books and movies that people would choose because they were attracted to the subject matter. Also, I was wearied by the lesbian kiss theme running through the book...it was a metaphor for what?...a lesbian kiss, weak. If a woman is insecure about something according to Michael you have a lesbian kiss and are redeemed somehow, no, sorry Michael.  If he wanted to develope a homosexual theme he should have spent more time on Richard.  I wanted to understand his suffering more...find out if he had any regrets.(i.e. Tom Hanks in Philadelphia...yes, I saw it.  But the promoters were upfront about that one; weren't they?)  Or maybe he could have explained more about why he didn't pursue Clarissa.  Or he could have explored further what kept Richard and Clarissa so close after all the years that had passed.  However, I will say he was on to something with the cake metaphor and the relationship between Laura Brown and her little boy,Richie. (I was touched by Laura and Richie's relationship.) So to sum it up folks if you write an agenda book now days you can get a Pulitzer and be automatically put on Hollywoods \\"A\\" list and have your book made into a movie.  I wish I had spent my money on Virginia Woolfe.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I loved this movie, just as much as i loved the book. They missed out tons of stuff though. I'm not gonna write it (i mean type it :}) all down cause that would take ages! But all in all it is a must see for wizards and muggles alike!
B000089CJI|5.0|This CD is absolutely amazing.  It has the feel of Death Cab (obviously with the singer) and with the heartfelt lyrics, but with a twist of happiness and optimism. The Nintendo style remixing and synth brings it to life. I highly recommend this CD.
0345409671|2.0|I am not one who searches for the meaning of life, or makes theories about &quot;how it all started&quot;, so for me this book was a disappointment. What some might find intriguing, I found tedious. This book was not an important addition to the Vampire Chronicles, like Lestat admits in the introduction, it's not important in this story that he is a vampire. Anne Rice is a great author, a fact that doesn't change in this book, but for someone expecting another action-packed continuation of the glamorous lives of the vampire, this book is not fulfilling. For those who are interested in fantastic theological theories, this book will prove enjoyable to you at least.
B000068QY7|5.0|<br />&quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; has a different beginnig than most Oasis albums. While we're used to &quot;Rock n Roll Star&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, and &quot;Do Y'Know What I Mean&quot;, HC opens with &quot;The Hindu Times&quot;. A song that has the familiar, instrument-before-vocals beginning, but the tempo is a lot slower. <br /><br /> &quot;Force of Nature&quot; has a good traditional rock sound to it. Although it took me a few times before I understood what Liam was saying, and no lyric book made it harder. But overall, decent song.<br /><br /> &quot;Hung In a Bad Place&quot;, is about the only song that got some sort of publicity: the ending was used in a Victoria's Secret commercial. The lyrics are kind of lousy, but once again, good rock sounds. 3 out of 5. <br /><br /> &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; had an amazingly different sound. Instead of loud gutairs, there was soft piano and violins. Lyrics are outstanding. They may be going in a new direction, but Noel can still write some of the best songs I've heard in a while.<br /><br /> &quot;Songbird&quot; was an up-tempo, happy sounding song. Gentle lyrics, but at only two minutes, I don't think I got what I fully expected. 2 and a half out of 5.<br /><br /> &quot;Little By Little&quot; resumes the traditional Oasis sound after two gentler songs. Drastic change from a short tune by a flute to a hard rock sound, but don't be dissatisfied. <br /><br /> &quot;A Quick Peep&quot; was like one of those waste-of-time 30 second songs on (What's the Story) Morning Glory. Should be removed.<br /><br /> &quot;(Probably) All In the Mind&quot; was a mix of what the entire album has been. Both hard rock, and happier sounding tunes. To my surprise, it didn't sound half bad. <br /><br /> &quot;She Is Love&quot; was once again another happy tune, with accoustics this time. Some lyrics made it resemble &quot;Songbird&quot;, but this time it was longer. <br /><br /> &quot;Born On A Different Cloud&quot; was too long. I think they tried to make it something like &quot;Champagne Supernova 2002&quot; <br /><br /> &quot;Better Man&quot; is just some sounds put together. Very disgusted in it. A horrible and sloppy ending to an otherwise beautiful creation. <br /><br /> In my book, this is the third greatest Oasis album ever. So get out your money (or credit card) and buy this. Loyal fan, or just getting in to them, it's a treat we all can enjoy.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|....a chick flick in the most negative sense of the term.  It uses a shallow plot (that's baby-pool-shallow, folks) as the infrastructure to carry out the murder of an array of classic rock and roll songs, songs which clash jarringly with the prewar-Paris setting of this musical.  The film appears to be intended as a sensory feast, both visually and aurally.  For me, the musical aspect simply does not work, although I know many people who really enjoyed the soundtrack.  The visual bombardment is technically well-done, and if you like frenetic and gawdy light and color superimposed on a Paris cabaret movie set which NEVER attempts to convince you that it is anything more real than a set on a sound stage, then you may well find the movie an exciting and stimulating experience.  Fans of maudlin filmmaking will enjoy the climactic tragedy of the affair between the poor young musical poet and the courtesan whose armored heart is finally breached by love, an affair that is doomed to end amidst a flood of tears gushing out from beneath the pancake makeup of the cabaret cast of the Moulin Rouge.  Heck, I don't know, maybe this movie is really somewhat faithful to the Bohemian pseudo-life of Paris nightclubs back in the day.  I sure did not like it much, though.
0767802470|2.0|The original version of the director's cut of Das Boot on VHS is widely, and I think rightly acknowledged as one of the greatest films ever made about men at war, and about submarine warfare in particular. So it was an enormous disappointment to me when I sat down to watch the DVD version of this classic to find that the movie had not only been re-dubbed with different actors, but the script had been re-translated!<br />After spending many enjoyable hours over several years watching the VHS version, I found the different voices and different words on the DVD very jarring, akin to watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon with Daffy Duck's voice!<br />So, if you have never seen this movie, I would have no hesitation in recommending this DVD - it's still a great film. But if, like me, you know and love the original VHS version of the director's cut of Das Boot, then I suggest you stick with it. (I have no idea whether recently produced VHS copies feature the original or new soundtrack and script.)
B000002OX7|5.0|It's always amazing when a band can create an album in which virtually every song is good.  This is not a greatest hits album, but it sounds like one.  Baba O'Riley (often called Teenage Wasteleand by mistake), Won't Get Fooled Again, and Behind Blue eyes are not just good, they are great rock classics.  Bargain, Going Mobile, and The Song is Over, are also very good songs.  I don't think the added songs were necessary, but they certainly don't take away from the quality.  In this album Pete Townshend excels as both a songwriter and guitarist.  He is backed up by probably the best rhythm section in rock history.  The result is a hard rock masterpiece.  Roger Daltery is hardly the most famous vocalist ever, but he sings (and screams) at his best in Who's Next. This album may be &quot;a classic&quot; but it sounds more fresh than dated.  If you don't already have Who's Next, you should get it.  It is some of the best music rock can offer.
B000003Z4C|5.0|Take it from someone who has been a longtime Nick Cave fan (from his first singles with The Birthday Party), even within his praiseworthy oeuvre, this is arguably the single best thing he has released. More than that it is one of the best music albums of all time. His lyrics are top notch-- like a cross between Edgar Allen Poe and Leonard Cohen. His voice is chilling. His and the band's playing is sublime. There is not a weak cut on it. Nick holds you in his grip from the first note to the last. Masterpiece is an appropriate appellation. Please do not hesitate in taking a chance on this album. Whatever your taste in music you will find a lot to admire-even thrill you.
B000069CWE|4.0|At first, I found this CD a serious let-down.  But after a while, after continuously listening to it, I thought it was very expressive in feelings of anger and depression.  Linkin Park is a group of geniuses.  The recreation of their songs, with input from other artists, has made this CD unique and intriguing.
B000002TQV|5.0|Of all the albums that Radiohead has put out, \\"The Bends\\" is by far the most underappreciated album that the band has released. Although songs like \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" had some moderate success as singles, the album itself is considered a failure commercially. Artistically, \\"The Bends\\" is a huge success. Radiohead proved to this listener that they aren't some one-hit wonder band whose moment in the spotlight is 15 minutes long, especially after the band had a huge hit with \\"Creep\\" from their first album \\"Pablo Album\\". \\"The Bends\\" picks off where \\"Pablo Honey\\" left and begins to experiment beyond the traditional sound of rock and roll that would lead to the brilliant masterpiece \\"OK Computer\\". \\"The Bends\\" blends together the sounds of both acoustic and electric guitars to achieve a sonic masterpiece. \\"Planet Telex\\" and \\"The Bends\\" kicks off the album with two of the band's most rockingest moments. \\"High and Dry\\" slows down its guitars but not to slow. The acoustic guitars and Thom Yorke's high-pitched yet well controlled vocals lends a haunting quality to the song. I absolutely love the acoustic sounds of \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\". That is one of my all time favorite Radiohead songs. The production on the song alone is just stellar. When I close my eyes to this song, I can see myself watching Radiohead play this song acoustically ala [MTV's] \\"Unplugged\\". \\"Bones\\" quickly lifts up the mood with the electric guitars and bass-driven sound. It is quite a contrast between that song and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\". \\"[Nice Dreams]\\" is my other personal favorite Radiohead song with its dreamy sound between acoustic and electric guitars, and Thom Yorke's haunting vocals. The entire album is so well produced. I think the production on \\"The Bends\\" surpasses \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\". Listening to \\"The Bends\\", I get a bit reminiscent and almost miss the days when the band wasn't so down on rock music and obsessed with making more experimental music. While I admit that \\"The Bends\\" wasn't a commercial hit album for the band but artistically, it succeeded where \\"Pablo Honey\\" didn't.ends\\" wasn't a commercial hit album for the band but artistically, it succeeded where \\"Pablo Honey\\" didn't.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Wow...finally the United States is playing music that has been around for a very long time and is very popular in Europe and most of the World. Industrial electronic EBM music has been around for quite some time from the likes Covenant, :Wumpscut:, VNV Nation just to name a few. It's a shame that Madonna's fans know more about EBM than American fans that have TRL stuffed downed their throat everyday. The music industry in America stinks and should realize that there is better music out there that dosn't revolve around the Inquirer's front page and who is dating who. Who cares music is supposed to be music and these girls are at least out there now and hopefully more bands and singles will creep from the wood works to shake American &quot;music&quot; as we know it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE POWER OF NORAH JONES DEBUT COME AWAY WITH ME. HER VOICE IS LIKE SILK WITH A TINGE OF THE BLUES, EACH SONG JUST FALLS INTO YOUR IMAGINATION.  HER BEAUTY IS BOTH HER LOOK WHICH IS COOL AND NATURAL AND HER SOUND. SHE WILL BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME AND I PLAN TO BUY EVERY ALBUM SHE PUTS OUT.  AMAZING
B000068TPN|5.0|My top 10 list is dangerously close to becoming 50% Mel Gibson movies.  He seams to pick the best movies,  and he's a good actor also.  This movie is 95% true,  and it's one hell of a story with very colorful characters.  Everyone should see it just for the historical value of it.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Do yourself a favour and see the movies before the books.<BR>They are not bad in their own right, but if you see the movie first, you'll be impressed twice because the ante is upped.
B00005JKL8|4.0|The Ground to Air missile schene in this movie is worth getting a Home Theater system and HDTV itself.  The story isn't great, but worth buying if you like action movies.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|It's just a stupid cartoon... I loved it. <BR>What can i say about shrek?<BR>It's just a comfort movie and it's a good one at that.<BR>&quot;lovable&quot; and &quot;cuddly&quot; come to mind as adjectives.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I wanted to watch this movie like I wanted a hole in my head.  I got stuck watching it with a women and surprise,  I liked it, Reese Weatherspoon has great carisma.
B000007VCM|5.0|This CD is perhaps the most overlooked CD from the 80s'. Ian Astbury's vocals are dead on as he sings psychedelic-tinged prose that rocks at the same time. Billy Duffy's guitar goes stride for stride with Astbury to combine in a sonic creation that rivals any CD released in the past 20 years for sheer &quot;feel&quot;.
6305428425|5.0|If you are a fan of so called &quot;girl movies&quot; you will love ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. It stars Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow, who play Romy and Michele respectively. They receive an invitation to their 10 year high school reunion. Through &quot;flashbacks&quot; we see what they were like in high school, as well as a bunch of other characters like Heather, Sandy, and more. Romy and Michele don't have any boyfriends, and Michele isn't working. Once they start doing their forms for the reunion to see what they've been up to, they realize their lives aren't very impressive and decide to do something about it. They devise a plan and say that they invented Post It Notes. Romy &amp; Michele have a falling out on the road trip there, and a weird dream ensues. Back to reality, at the reunion, dressed as business woman, they are laughed out of the place when their lie is uncovered by Heather. Romy &amp; Michele make up and are friends again, and decide to have fun nonetheless. They realize it doesn't matter what anyone thought of them, that they had fun with each other nonetheless. They come in their own flashy outfits that their peers would have remembered them in, and ultimately take the place by storm and show up everyone who did them wrong in high school. Michele finally hooks up with Sandy, who had a crush on her in high school, Romy sets her crush straight, and they go back to live a fabulous life in LA where they own their own fashion store. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow were made for these roles, it's truly a great movie for laughs and smiles. Oh and the soundtrack for the movie is excellent, 80's classics! Overall a real treat you must see!
B0000797IO|5.0|If you like Mike White's work (screenwriter), you will love and &quot;get&quot; this.  If you don't, you won't.  The reviewers that do not like this movie, to my mind, just don't get it, which is fine.  It will not be to everyone's taste.  I don't know if this is a true independent film or not, but is it surely in the spirit of the best independent films.  It is dark, ironic, unsettling.  Very original, uncliched.  I have seen it about four times now, counting the voice over commentaries, and have gotten more out of it each time.  Jennifer Anniston is fabulous.  As others have said, it is a career changing role.  I have not been a big JA fan, but I am now.  Nuanced.  Subtle.  Disarming.  Bravo.  Virtually every performance is outstanding.
B00008DDXC|3.0|The movie was good, even great if you haven't read the book. It poorly followed the book and all of us crazed, wierd, Harry Potter fanatics will be left tripping along as things move to quickly through the story, with strange unnecessary  additions to the small parts, and giant cuts in the important and big parts. I liked the movie and I plan on buying it to go along with my collection (of course I'm considered on of the most serious Harry Potter fanatics in my high school so of course I would buy it and like it) but, I think that if you're a big fan of the books than you will be dissapointed. But, that's only a matter of opinion. I would reccomend this movie and do reccomend it, but if you've read the books you might want to lower your expectations and forget the way the book was. Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix comes out on June 21st! Don't forget! Harry Potter forever!!!!!!!!!!
B0000640VO|4.0|The ups and downs of Amelie made a interesting story.  It ignores a  traditional movie format, with whimsey, and a good balance of magic in a modern world.  Light hearted and Fun, I was entertained and pulling for Amelie the whole way.<BR>A movie which might have been overlooked by many, which makes it a great addition to a dvd collection, you'll always have something people haven't seen, and it's appriote for most company.<BR>AO
B00003CXXM|5.0|wow, based on a novel that kicked some ..., and sold thousands and thousands of copies, the film has done it justice, the screenplay is excellent and the storyline with substance and quality that is surpassed by few films or books.<br />with one of the best car chases since the french connection, and the best mini since the italian job, i think that it has everything.<br />matt damon looks like he has been in the gym for six months to get his physique but all top notch and some great english actors also, at least i think he is english, the guy from the croupier and gosford park
B000007T1M|5.0|There are so many people who have claimed without hesitation that System of a Down are just one of those &quot;Nu-Metal&quot; bands that only know how to play four chords and not very well.  Well, obviously anybody who said that either has not listened to either three of their CD's, probably has not even seen video of them in concert, or probably has not heard one of their songs at all.  Although I do believe that System of a down have sort of created their own batch of metal, with mixes of rap and even a little bit of eastern flavor, they still possess that raw talent of guitar and pounding drums that show through their violent and aggressive music, that atleast inhabited here, anyways.  Serj Tankian's voice is incredibly melodic, but he also has the ability to growl with such fury it's surprising.  This singer is by all means, what I would consider multi-talented, with four different sets of voice.  They can also, might I add, make a complete and total boring song and turn it into the headthrashers dinner, while making it seem natural, planned out and well produced. Almost every song on this CD is great, and even the overplayed 'Mind' has its kicks, although it is the weirdest song that I've ever heard in my entire life.<BR>     I had said on my review of 'Toxicity' that it was better than the self titled;  I take that back, because looking at it, all the once superiority and aggressive feelings that seemed to eat itself into the music and provide lots of creative flow that came out naturally just disintigrated.  Not that it's a bad thing, only that System of A down have kind of lost their zest that made them what they were.<BR>     However, Toxicity was still great, but Self Titled is better.  None of that 'First Recording' crud that was on Toxicity, only headbanging metal, (Yes, 'Metal' not 'Nu-Metal') great singing, wonderful drums and raw talent.  Spiders is worth buying the CD within itself.
B00008DDXB|5.0|ok so i may be 16 soon to turn 17 but i went to see this film with a bunch of mates as there was nothing all that interesting on other than films we had already seen, and to be honest i thought that it was an excellent film, made well, great acting and the effects kicked ....<br />definately aimed at the younger children but still a hit with all the age ranges i think this is why it has become such a big hit with everyone.<br />the stotyline is strong and even though it's a sequel and people tend to think that sequels lose that special something that the original had, take dusk til dawn, great film poor sequel the same for the scream movies although i personally thought that the second film wasnt that bad, although the third was the worst most poorly constructed film of the three, probably of that year.<br />anyway i would recomend this film to anyone that is even interested and curious, ant to those who arent you dont know what you are missing
B0000024ZT|5.0|Have you ever heard the song &quot;For You&quot;, this album is absolutely amazing.
B00006L85B|5.0|5 stars for the CD; 5 stars for being able to WATCH the great Mr Miguel on screen. However, one wonders why the audio on the DVD is so dreadful (except the last track). There is so much hissing sound that makes listening a bit difficult. Certainly for the track &quot;Por Debajo De La Mesa&quot; a better version has previously been released (on the Romances DVD Audio). Nevertheless, 5 stars for this CD/DVD, like for anything else he has done in the past 10 years.
B00005JLO2|3.0|\\"The Four Feathers\\" is a gloriously photographed, well-acted historical epic. What nearly undoes it is the source material - a 1902 novel by A.E.W. Mason, which has been filmed at least four times before. There were silent versions made in 1915, 1922 and 1929, as well as a highly regarded talking version in 1939. Its story of a pacifist who is cast out of British society because he refuses to go to war is still compelling, but the idea that British colonialism and the warfare it produced was somehow noble and glorious is not. <br />Harry Faversham [Heath Ledger] is a young member of an elite branch of the British Army. His good friends are the best and the brightest in the regiment. He is engaged to the smart, beautiful Ethne [Kate Hudson]. His life seems perfect until he and his friends learn that their regiment is to be sent to the Sudan to help quell a native rebellion. Harry suddenly realizes he doesn't want to go to war. His whole life has been dictated by his military family. He impulsively quits the army. Ethne and three of his friends send him white feathers, which are symbols of what they perceive to be his cowardice. He is filled with guilt, not because he left the army, but because he abandoned his friends. A few weeks later, he secretly journeys to the Sudan to find them. It's a dangerous trip, and by the time he reaches them, he can not bring himself to reveal himself. Instead, he disguises himself as an Arab and aids them in secret.<br />This is obviously an expensive movie. It contains massive battles scenes and lavish sets. For the visuals alone, it is worth seeing. Ledger gives a first rate performance as Faversham, as does Wes Bentley as his best friend, Lt. Jack Durrance. The script, however, can't help but show us people in places they shouldn't be doing things they shouldn't do. [Westerners prior to WW II didn't view it this way.] We still have great empathy for Faversham as regards his feelings of loyalty to his friends, but it's hard to feel much sympathy for the friends themselves, due to their blind obedience to the dubious ideals of the British Empire. In the end, \\"The Four Feathers\\" is itself outdated.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I loved some of the songs that never got radio airplay.  The thing I like the most is Pink uses so many different styles, it's a huge change from one song to the next.  Keeps it interesting.
B00006CXSS|5.0|...Band of Brothers is an excellent piece of television cinematics that should be viewed not only for its stunningly accurate portrayal of war in all its destructive force, but also its ironic, almost relaxing face.  Through Band of Brothers, we learn what it must have been to partake in the war and we learn what must have been thought by the soldiers who fought in it.
B0000640S1|4.0|This movie is several notches above the subsequent sequals. Take special note that the DVD edition includes a narration track by the book's original author.  His story of how he came to write it, and how long it took to get to the screen is fascinating. This is a really enjoyable disc.
0790740443|5.0|This movie is a must for every action fan.<BR>The DVD contains a perfect video- and audio transfer + some nice extras. Kurt Russell did a great job. He must trained so hard to come in superb shape for that movie.<BR>I think he is a great actor and shows the audience that there is still hope and love in that destroyed character &quot;Todd&quot;, not with words but with mime.
B00005JLXC|3.0|After hearing much hype on Daredevil, (\\"It's better than Spiderman, dawg!!!\\") I decided to check it out.  After watching it, I felt it was essentially good, but still missing something.  I can't argue with SOME of the fight scenes, but movie critics anywhere know that other scenes were just wanna-be Matrix.  Affleck gave a solid performance, but the error was in the plot, as I never felt it was going anywhere during the movie.  Basically, there wasn't enough content to satisfy the plot.  If you want to check out an excellent comic book hero movie, watch Spiderman.
B00005HYHA|5.0|My parents took a trip to Japan, and when they went they got me Dark Side Of The Moon.  Other than it containing a little fold out insert with all of the Japanese writing as well as advertising for other Floyd albums everything is in English.    It sounds great, but I don't know if there's any change between North American and Japanese versions.  And there were NO mini posters or stickers unlike some people have said.    This is from Toshiba-EMI Japan and the TOCP is 65559    People might think it \\"sounds\\" better because it is the 1992 Digital Remaster and the CD is Copyright 1994.    I don't know if it's worth the price to have it imported, but if someone you know goes over and buys it for 2,500 Yen, get it!
B00007BHOE|5.0|Come on everyone, admit it, everyone knows they like at least one slipknot song because everyone gets mad at the world. surfacing is the best choice here i believe, well, imagine seein it live. it's the coolest, but i think the best part of the dvd is anytime you see Joey (1) or Sid (0). only cuz they are the craziest dudes live, who wouldn't want to see sid crowdsurfing and then hit a fan. it shows it live in this during spit it out, and joey just rocks, the best parts are when he bashes his head into his cymbals and his solo which is (sic). believe me, i've been to 2 slipknot concerts (Ozzfest 2001, and tattoo the earth 200o 'fore they were huge) and you can completely feel what it's like to be at one of the shows minus the bruises and cuts and ears that hurt from the amps. so basically it's a painless rockin slipknot concert that you can totally rock to. well, painless unless you rock out like i did and bash your head on the walls and jump off your bed in a swan dive motion. oww. slipknot is one of the craziest bands live, get it, love it, live it, be (sic). so ask yourself this, Are you ready to take the ... test my friends? well, you're about to get your ... chance.....\\" - Corey, intro to Spit It Out, LIVE! oh, and for those who aren't sure about the parental advisory cuz it says nuthing about it on the description, you can't buy this edited. so worry not my friends.
B00004XMTH|5.0|The first time I saw ''Cats'', I didn't enjoy it that much to be perfectly honest.  I had difficulty following the storyline.  I decided to give it another try and it was so much better the second time.  Now it's a favorite that I hope to own.  I have watched it over and over again, and it's absolutely enchanting.
B000084T18|5.0|If you like In Da Club, you will like this CD. Definitely not overrated--worth every penny. I am the type to listen to a few songs on a CD, then change the CD, but this CD I can leave on and listen to the songs consistently. Great songs--check out &quot;Many Men&quot; if you like In Da Club. On another note, I do not like the song Wanksta, and feel it doesn't reflect on the rest of their album.
0783240503|5.0|You are in for a treat.  The music, costumes, acting, all outstanding.  Donny Osmond is the perfect Joseph.  You will laugh, and have an enjoyable time watching this with your family.<BR>The only problem, you get the songs stuck in your head, and you can't get them out.  You will be going around singing them constantly.  Go Joseph!
B0000542DJ|5.0|In \\"JFK\\", Oliver Stone unleashes the secrets that our government were afraid to tell. They were afraid, and cared more about politics, than they did people, and Oliver Stone came through for us.<BR> Now, much has been said about Stone, in the media, but we must understand that this same media has CIA Agents working for it, which makes the media's opinions pure government Propaganda.<BR>The scoundrels who attack this film are trying to do your thinking for you.<BR> Dont let them.

B00005YW4H|5.0|This is one of those albums that I bought based on one song I heard on the radio, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. With a single and hardly anything else to go on (at that point I had not read anything about this album yet), I decided to give Norah Jones a chance.<br />If you're want a nice, relaxing sound to help you forget about your worldly worries for 45 minutes, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is the album for you. The music is very soothing, smooth and jazzy that would go perfect with a warm, bubble bath and aromatic candles. <br />Norah Jones' voice is sultry, silken, and a nice contrast to the harsh sounds of heavy traffic, fire truck sirens, and obnoxious neighbors in the summer. When I just want to get away from it all, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; takes me to a distinctly warm and romantic ambience with its cool-cat jazz bar sound, sans the second-hand smoke. -- NT
B00005MM01|4.0|The rule of thumb would be that if you remember that Donovan's last name was Leitch then you probably are a big enough fan to appreciate &quot;Gift From a Flower to a Garden,&quot; which was the first two-LP box set to appear in the rock 'n' roll section rather than the classical at your local record store.  Of course now this collection of flower power music appears on a single CD.  Donovan was saddled with the responsibility of being Britain's answer to Bob Dylan, which was an unfair standard, but his music holds up, especially when you realize they are such opposites.  Dylan is American folk music gone poetic in search of dark introspection while Donovan was optimistic psychedelic mysticism (Were the Beach Boys America's answer to the Beatles? Just wond'rin' aloud).  &quot;Gift From a Flower to a Garden&quot; comes across like two different Donovan albums recorded at the same time.  One is psychedelic of the electric guitar outer space variety and the other is a return to folk and blues played on an acoustic guitar.  In terms of songwriter Donovan shows a lot more variety here than you find on his other albums, and the nice thing is that there is minimal overlap between this double-album and Donovan's Greatest Hits collection (&quot;Wear Your Love Like Heaven&quot;).  The second half of the collection, with &quot;Isle of Islay&quot;, &quot;Widow with a Shawl&quot;, and &quot;Lullaby of the Spring&quot;, is better than the first half (or at least more to my taste).
B00005JLR2|3.0|This movie was very well done. The special effects were excellent and the story was good, following closely to the novel Treasure Island. There's just one problem I have with it, in that, it lacks a certain Disney quality. The quality that was in Lion King, Alladin, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, etc. All of these newer Disney flicks (Atlantis, Lilo and Stitch, Treasure Planet) really show us how far we've come in animation but are different as they deal with the future/space/weird stuff unlike the more contemporary films that are based on fairy tales and such. Now that Disney has decided to branch out toward bigger and better things with sci-fi action movies, it's a little startling. I guess I'm just not used to these newer Disney movies with all these aliens and high tech machinery. I'd like Disney to make one more prince/princess/fantasy movie before they bring us into the next generation because the older films, I think, is what Disney did best. But Treasure Planet otherwise was an awesome feature with a wonderful pulsating soundtrack. (I really enjoyed the two songs that are sung and would buy the soundtrack solely for those while they were accompanied by a terrific score.)
B00005YW4H|5.0|I must say that this is the best &quot;new&quot; album I have bought in a long time.  Not only is it original, but Jones mixes new sounds with her smooth jazz vocals.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  The thing that makes her stand out so much is that her style is so different from anyone else's who is out right now.  When you hear her song &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; mixed in with hip hop and r&amp;b on the radio it sounds out of place and hard to listen to... but if you listen to it on its own it's great.  There isn't a bad track on the whole album.  A must for any jazz fan.
B00006J3WH|5.0|WOW!!! This is a great a soundtrack for one of the best episodes of the best show on television. Sarah Michelle rocks as the lead of this all around wonderful cast. The two highlights of this CD are clearly \\"Wish I Could Stay\\" with Amber benson and Anthony Stewart Head, and \\"Something to Sing About\\" with Sarah Michelle Gellar. The classic marriage song, \\"I'll Never Tell\\" is done quite well. \\"I've Got a Theory\\" is wicked hilarious, and \\"Under Your Spell\\" is PERFECT. This CD is a reall triumph for the Buffy creator, Joss Whedon. THIS ROCKS!! BUY IT!!
B00000I07P|2.0|Bon Jovi mixes rock and pop on this album to make something that has a complete 80s sound. This album, especially the hit livin on a prayer, is a complete Bruce Springsteen ripoff. After seeing how well Springsteen had been doing (in particular 2 years earlier with Born In The USA) this band tried to use the same themes in their music but it didn't work so well for them. Buy Springsteen way before this.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Don't listen to those who bash this film.  They simply were'nt willing to look into the meaning of the film.  I found that this movie wowed me more than almost any other movie in the past several years.  Many people complain that it doesnt have a serious plot, and it jumps from person to person.  Well, dur!  This is a movie that is supposed to be like a dream, one in which various new ideas are presented and discussed.  The visuals of this movie are fantastic, causing the viewer to look anew at the world around them.  The ideas presented within are well argued, thought out, and very diverse.  This is not a traditional movie by any means, but if you are willing to try something new, and you want your perspective of the world to be challenged, then please, watch this movie.
B00005AQE8|2.0|This ... was pretty weak. The beats were some of the worst I've ever heard, and 2pac's got a terrible flow. I really don't know what people see in this album. There's only like 10 good songs on this. I can't believe some people think this is the greatest album. This isn't even the greatest double disc.
0140277447|5.0|In research for my own book on the causes of war, hate and terrorism, I read The Rape of Nanking. This book should be required reading for every school age child and politician in the world - no exceptions. The truth of our own human potential for evil drips from each page like the blood from a Japanese bayonette just thrust into the body of an innocent young man. The lesson I got from this timless masterpiece is that our potential for virtually indescribable cruelty and evil exists in each person and all of civilization at every moment. Hell, as the Chinese experienced, is not some place after death, but is found in this world. We are heading in that very direction right now. For this reason, it is vital that our leaders teach peace. We don't need any more experts in killing. We don't need any brilliant minds poisoned by the misplaced values of aggression and death spun out by War College. What can we learn from the Rape of Nanking? War is evil and it begins in the hearts and minds of men. As far as I'm concerned the Rape of Nanking happened yesterday. Enough is enough!

B00005Y7NK|4.0|After the Eternol Idol tour, Tony Martin and Tony Iommi(and Geoff) were the only people in Black Sabbath left. Bass player, Jo Burt and drummer, Terry Chimes left the band in 1987. The band hired bass player, Laurance Cottle and former Rainbow and Whitesnake drummer, Cozy Powell. The band's 18th line-up made Headless Cross. The album starts with The Gates Of Hell then goes right into the self titled track. I like the self titled track. Devil and Daughter and When Death Calls are other metal tracks whitch are worth listening. Kill The In The Spirt World is the same thing. Call Of the Wild is another metal track but somethings different with this one. As we can here in the song \\"Hero\\". Why did they say that? The song's working title was Hero. The title was soon change because someone else had a son called Hero. Black Sabbath's old friend, Ozzy Osbourne. Black Moon and Rightwing are normal metal track. About when the album was to be released, Cottle left the band. The band hired Neil Murray to replace Cottle on the same day the album was released. But in 1990, Murray left and Sabbath went on with the changing line-ups. But in 1994, Martin returned for Sabbath's next album, Cross Purpose. Then later in 1995, Murray and Powell returned for the next album, Forbidden. Of course, Powell left and was replaced with Bobby(who played drums on Cross Purpose) Sadly in 1998, Powell died in a car crash at the age of 50. Headless Cross remains a unrated album but is still good.
0385503954|3.0|I loved the beginning of the novel, but after a while it seems to slow down so much it becomes a drag. It should have been reduced to a third of its length to be enjoyable. Not that I didn't appreciate the descriptions, but too many details can drown the plot and the story seems to lose its power. The writing is pleasing and stylish. Not enough dialogue though. The characters don't seem to sort out their problems and there is no real resolution, which is why it left me frustrated. By the way, is this a book about WW2 or atonement? The story seems to focus on too many things at the same time. It explores the atrocities of war, which have nothing to do with Briony's personal &quot;crime&quot;. Maybe the war added to Robbie's anger. However what doesn't make sense is that first he seems to be willing to forgive, then he reacts totally differently, like another character altogether. It is a bit confusing. I would recommend this book, as it is interesting, but I wouldn't say it's one of the best books I've read.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is one of the most engrossing albums I have ever heard. I have listened to it over and over without concept of time.  I feel that the girls have worked really hard and deserve all the sucess that they acheive. I recomend anyone to listen to this album and challenge modern boundaries and openly accept this album and get a much pleasure out of it as I have.
B000002J09|5.0|Well... haha. It's the greatest album in the history of rock. From the bizarrely wonderful Black Dog to the drums from God in the blues-crossed-with-a-thermonuclear-device When the Levee Breaks, and everything in between (the hyper, upbeat Rock and Roll - aptly named, as it fairly perfectly exemplifies the genre, the supernally spooky Battle of Evermore (where Plant's voice becomes something you'll swear isn't human), Stairway to Heaven (called by many (including me) the greatest rock song ever written) with its flawless Page solo, the loud, majestic, and vastly underrecognized Misty Mountain Hop, the gorgeous folky ode Going to California, and the softly rumbling Four Sticks), it's as if all the music of the entire century was mixed together and distilled into one scintillating 42:35 of glory. You'll like it, I promise.
630522577X|5.0|Based upon the hit play \\"Pygmalian\\" by George Bernard Shaw and directed by George Cukor, the 1964 film \\"My Fair Lady\\" is a masterpiece of story, song and script that earned 8 Oscars and a total of 12 Oscar nominations in 1965.  The film stars Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, Rex Harrison (who won the Oscar for Best Actor) as Professor Henry Higgins, Stanley Holloway (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) as Eliza's father Alfred P. Doolittle, Wilfred Hyde-White as Colonel Hugh Pickering and Gladys Cooper (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress) as Henry's mother Mrs. Higgins.<br />Set in London circa 1900, Henry Higgins is an internationally renowned professor of the English language.  While leaving a show one evening, Henry meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, who planned to meet with Henry and vice versa.  After being interrupted by a poor young woman (Eliza Doolittle) selling flowers and who has a dreadful accent, Henry begins a discourse on the defilement of the English language and how one can identify an individual's origins through their accent and dialect. Eliza, of course, is insulted.  Henry and Colonel Pickering leave for Henry's home, but Eliza thinks seriously about a proposal that Henry said in jest: that he could teach Eliza how to speak properly and improve her station in life.  The following morning, Eliza (who overheard where Henry lives) arrives at his front door.  After coming in, she asks Henry to give her English lessons that she'll pay for.  He initially rejects the idea, but changes his mind with the assistance of Colonel Pickering.  Eliza is whisked away upstairs by his maid, Mrs. Pearce (Mona Washbourne), to be cleaned.  A torment of screams ensues as Eliza is stripped naked and bathed.  Her tattered clothes are burned per Henry's orders, but new clothes are purchased for her.<br />Thus begins Eliza's training in the proper use of the English language through the skills of Henry Higgins.  Eliza sees Henry as an overbearing misogynist, but Henry sees himself as the exact opposite and he gets the opportunity of meeting Eliza's father Alfred.  Eliza learns over time, and a mutual love-hate relationship develops between her and Henry.<br />The numerous wonderful songs in the film were written by Frederick Loewe and directed by Andre Previn (who received the Oscar for Best Music Adaptation).  Audrey Hepburn did not get to sing in the film; instead, Marni Nixon dubbed her, as was Jeremy Brett (who played Eliza's would-be young suitor, Freddie Eynsford-Hill) by Bill Shirley.  The songs in the film include:<br />* \\"Why Can't The English?\\" (5+/5, Rex Harrison and Marni Nixon) In front of the opera house.<BR>* \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\" (5+/5, Marni Nixon) In front of the opera house.<BR>* \\"I'm An Ordinary Man\\" (5/5, Rex Harrison) At Henry's home, after Eliza comes.<BR>* \\"With A Little Bit Of Luck\\" (4.5/5, Stanley Holloway & ensemble) Eliza's father prior to meeting Henry.<br />* \\"Just You Wait\\" (5+/5, Marni Nixon) Eliza angry with Henry.<BR>* \\"Servant's Chorus\\" (4.5/5 ensemble) Henry's servants lamenting him teaching Eliza.<BR>* \\"The Rain In Spain\\" (4.5/5, Rex Harrison, Marni Nixon & Wilfred Hyde-White) Eliza finally getting a pronunication correct.<BR>* \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" (5/5, Marni Nixon, Mona Washbourne & ensemble) Eliza excited over celebrations with Henry & Colonel Pickering.<BR>* \\"Ascot Gavot\\" (4.5/5, ensemble) At the horse race.<BR>* \\"Ascot Gavot (Reprise)\\" (4.5/5, ensemble) At the horse race.<BR>* \\"On The Street Where You Live\\" (4/5, Bill Shirley) Freddie thinking of Eliza outside Henry's home.<BR>* \\"The Transylvanian March\\" (4/5, instrumental) At the ball.<BR>* \\"The Embassy Waltz\\" (4.5/5, instrumental) At the ball.<BR>* \\"You Did It\\" (4.5/5, Wilfred Hyde-White, Rex Harrison & ensemble) Henry & Colonel Pickering congratulating themselves.<BR>* \\"Just You Wait (Reprise)\\" (4.5/5, Marni Nixon) Eliza upset.<BR>* \\"On the Street Where you Live (Reprise)\\" (4/5,Bill Shirley) Freddie still outside of Henry's home.<BR>* \\"Show Me\\" (5/5, Marni Nixon and Bill Shirley) Eliza & Freddie leaving Henry's home together.<BR>* \\"The Flower Market\\" (5/5, Marni Nixon) Back at the flower market.<BR>* \\"Get Me To The Church On Time\\" (3.5/5, Stanley Holloway & ensemble) Alfred celebrating before his impending marriage.  The song is somewhat too long in my opinion.<BR>* \\"A Hymn To Him\\" (5+/5, Rex Harrison & Wilfred Hyde-White) Henry extolling the virtues of men.<BR>* \\"Without You\\" (5/5, Marni Nixon & Rex Harrison) Eliza putting Henry in his place.<BR>* \\"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\\" (5/5, Rex Harrison) Henry feeling alone.<br />\\"My Fair Lady\\" deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture, as did George Cukor for Best Director.  The film also won Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costumes and Best Sound.  I rate this film with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys superb acting and musicals.
B00006690H|5.0|This CD is awesome! He expresses himself way more, and also more serious! His last CDs were mostly him having fun, but 'The Eminem Show' tells a lot about his life, it's great! Anyone who has a problem with it jut has a problem with themselves! All of the songs are awesome!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you've seen the film, you'll know how wonderfully wacky and off-beat it is. This album follows the same direction....from mainstream pop songs like Rhythm Of The Night to the excellent version of Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend, this album is a great way to re-live the magic of the movie. Of course, the biggest drawcard is the chance to hear Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sing, and they measure up very nicely. Their vocal talents are showcased on several tracks, but the highlight would have to be Elephant Love Medley - a collage of many love songs, where Nicole and Ewan really shine in their vocal abilities. Another standout track is Diamonds Are A girls Best Friend, with Nicole in lead vocals. This would have be the best version of this song - a throughly modern version of a wonderful classic. A slight disappointment is the exclusion of 'Like A virgin' - if you've seen the movie, you would know how hilarious this version is. Do yourself a favour - go and see the movie and buy this CD!
B000077VR3|4.0|This movie is a real ride!!!  Its a combination carnival, opera, Broadway musical and a little MTV thrown in.    Its a clever and imaginative film that uses the camera to move constantly. Zooming in and out and sweeping around  circa 1900 Paris cityscapes.  It presents itself in ever moving visuals.  The ever familiar  songs and lavish production numbers seem to be perfectly sequenced, much like some of the old MGM musicals. This, of course,  attributed to the filmaking genius of Australian director Baz Luhrmann.<br />This is not a dialogue driven film.  In fact, the plot is familiar and not overdone, and deliberately meant to be that way.  Its enough to keep you apprised of the story going on in the background while it spins and creates a fantasy land presented in glitz,  frenzied energy, glamour,  and classic  popular songs.<br />Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and the rest of the cast are no slouches, either.  This couple really throw sparks as the hopeless romantics in the film.  All the actors sing their own songs and are quite talented at it in a not so perfect Broadway kind of way....  <br />This is by no means an adequate or ordinary film.  Its unique and yes, familiar.  Its meant to be a crowd pleaser.  Even though the pace of the movie is frenetic, it is also comforting, for most people anyway.   Kind of like a ride at Disneyland!
B000089RV6|5.0|Put it in and crank it up!!! This album is a masterpiece of style, rhythm, attitude and sexual innuendo's, oh yeah and all the booze references.   This album is far above a 5 star album, but that's all they would let me rate it at so 5 stars it gets, and deservedly so.<br />\\"Back in Black\\" is AC/DC pure and simple.  If you want to hear what AC/DC is all about, and what Rock & Roll should be, then this is the album.  This album encapsulates the very essence of the band.  There are not enough great things to say about this album, buy it and I swear you will not be disappointed!!
0449002632|4.0|When I started this book, I couldn't put it down. I loved the first characters and reading about how they lived, etc. When the first storyline ended, I was so disappointed because I was enjoying that story so much! However, then next story was just as wonderful, as was the next and the next.  But I didn't like ending one story only to have another one start hundreds of years later. I also had difficulty keeping track of the families...whom was seeking revenge on whom, etc. But I love historical fiction and overall, I have to give this book good marks.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Okay I have to admit, I wasn't at all interested the slightest bit for this group...I've read about them in an article in a magazine about two years ago and I was like \\"Who the hell are they??\\" and \\"What the hell is going on in Russia?\\".  But I've heard clips of the song \\"All The Things She Said\\" on the radio, and it literally got me to buy the c.d.  After listening to it for the first time, I truely fell in love with the album and with the two girls who consist of this group.  The songs on this album are very unique in sound and are all very listenable and it takes you to a whole new world that is true;y blissful.  <br />Track 1 \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\": When I first heard this song, I thought it was alright, but the more I listened to it the more I absolutely love it.  It's now one of my favorites, I love the beats of the song as well as the chorus. Very good! Such great upbeat song! 9.5 out of 10<br />Track 2 \\"All The Things She Said\\": By far one of the best songs on this album.  The whole song is just sooOOOoo good, man words cannot describe this song.  It's just so catchy and...AMAZING!  10 out of 10<br />Track 3 \\"Show Me Love\\": Another outstanding song!  The beginning starts off with a phone conversation and then starts the beats.  The music itself is very brilliant.  I love these girl's voices...it's just soo intimate sounding!  Very good song, and very good chorus!  9.8 out of 10<br />Track 4 \\"30 Minutes\\": My favorite song on this album.  This song is like no other...it's truely brilliant.  A great ballad that has some atmospheric taste to it.  10 out of 10<br />Track 5 \\"How Soon is Now?\\": This is a also a very good song on this album but is the least of my favorites.  It's a cover of the song by the band The Smiths and somewhat changes the style of the album.  I don't really know why, but as soon as I heard this song...I immediately thought that it didn't really belong on the album.  I guess it's because it's too much on the happy/poppy level but it really is a good song though, the chorus is very good and up to par.  9 out of 10.  <br />I can't review every single song b/c I will just say the same thing over and over again and I'm sure no one wants to read a trite review.  But seriously, every song on this album is beautifully and craftly done.  These girls (Lena and Julia) are very talented and have such unique voices.  This album is not like any other album; if i would have to classify this album under a certain genre...I guess I'd label it \\"dark electro-pop\\"?  The lyrics of these songs are very impressive and have such meaning behind it that everyone should listen to this group.  So what if these girls may be lesbians or not, it's the music that counts, not their sexual preference....so hit this album up! <br />This album is also ENHANCED, so you can pop it in your computer and watch BEHIND THE SCENES footage of the group as well as watch the MUSIC VIDEO of the song \\"ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID\\".  What a bargain huh?? SO GET THIS ALBUM EVERYONE!  THEY ARE TRUELY TALENTED....!!  Absolutely amazing
B00006RU5B|5.0|It's about time that something this great has come along and kicked the music industry in the... In a time of manufactured pop bands and teen queens, Audioslave is a welcome and much needed band. The combonation of Chris Cornell and the ultra-tight playing of former members of RATM: Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk is nothing but spectacular. With Chris Cornell's powerful voice and the groovy, melodic playing styles of Tom, Tim, and Brad, I really hope that Audioslave sticks around for more than just one album, if not it would be such a waste of talent.<BR>Get this CD before you miss out...!
B00005JLZL|4.0|i was shocked to find that 80% of the reviews of this film emply the word \\"sanctimonious\\"...the only thing i can assume is that people consider it \\"sanctimonious\\" when you make evident to them the immorality of their judicial system's dogma of retribution...this film is, and this needs to be acknowledged, enormously anti-american...and no doubt that is going to make for bad press...americans by disposition are not martyrs...we are confused and morally-outraged by people who are willing to give their lives for a cause..a story of a man who hs traded in his sad, pathetic life to further the cause of a political/moral belief strikes at a cultral nerve which runs back to 9/11..we as a society can't comprehend this...we live in a victor-culture..the only martyr we halfway admrie is jesus christ--and even he is dubious in this role b/c he had a resurrection....doesn't count if you don't stay dead<br />this film in no way is agenda-free...but why should it have to be...when the gross majority of films being made try desperately to say nothing, it is of great comfort to know that someone is still willing to moralize, be controbversial and \\"sanctimonious\\"...god bless...you made us think.
0553382179|5.0|For the past few years I have read many books on getting organized, decluttering, and the like.  This is the ONLY book that has given me the information I needed to get my house in order.  After reading this book, my house is literally 100% more organized than ever before, and I have taken all my other decluttering books and thrown them out!  They were only making clutter, and clutter was what I was trying to get rid of.<BR>A must read for anyone who wants once and for all to get the CHAOS (can't have anyone over syndrome) out of their lives and really start to live!
B00005YW4H|1.0|I had heard this CD was just wonderful and I do like the title track &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; that I have heard playing EVERYWHERE...but after that one song this CD falls flat. Each song is very similar and not necessarily the jazzy sound I was expecing, in fact, I found most of the songs on this CD to be boring. I like Norah's voice and agree she has great potential but this CD is a snoozer.
6303418287|4.0|I haven't read the actual novel in years, but my roommate sat me down and had me watch this movie (I believe the words \\"Shirtless Kenneth Branagh\\" were heavily stressed) at about 2:30 the other morning, and I was blown away. It sticks closer to the novel than other versions, as far as I can remember, and while Kenneth Branagh's performance, as amazing as it was, didn't seem up to his usual intensity the two other lead actors blew me away. Robert De Niro was so adept at portraying the pathos and later sinister threat of the Creature that I forgot this was the same man I saw in \\"Meet the Parents\\" a week ago. :) And Helena Bonham Carter, always one of my favorite actresses, is responsible for carrying the last twenty minutes of the film. Purists be warned, there's a serious deviation in these last twenty minutes; but to me, it seemed to add to the story, not detract. However, they're worth watching just to see some absolutely AMAZING acting. All the horror and humanity in the story comes to a brutal, beautiful climax. This is a film that will stay with you.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|At last, the &quot;Metropolis&quot; film restoration project is complete, and the results are brilliant. One of the greatest and most influential science fiction films in history has been rescued from oblivion, and now it can survive in digital glory to amaze and capture the imaginations of future generations.<br />The first time I purchased a DVD of this film, it was the &quot;Hollywood Classics&quot; version, and I was so terribly disappointed by the scratchy print that I could hardly get past the first 20 minutes, and ultimately I donated the disc to my local public library. Sure, I knew that surviving prints of &quot;Metropolis&quot; had deteriorated badly, but I had assumed in the age of the DVD that something watchable would be available. The &quot;Hollywood Classics&quot; version is NOT watchable.<br />But now the definitive version is out, and it's FANTASTIC. I suspect most people who purchase this disc are already familiar with the film and venerate it like I do. But there's much more to recommend this DVD than just the fact that the film has been digitally restored as closely to the version that originally premiered in Berlin in 1927. The extras on this disc are amazing. You'll want to pore over the extensive photo galleries. You'll also enjoy the &quot;Metropolis Case&quot; documentary about Fritz Lang and the place of the film in German Expressionist film history. The short feature about how the film was digitally cleaned up is also interesting, though a bit academic.<br />But when you finally decide to settle in and watch the film itself, I would highly suggest watching it with the excellent commentary by Enno Patalas ON. It's very well-scripted and provides the film with a great deal of extra meaning and resonance. You've already seen the film a number of times, right? You'll enjoy the commentary, trust me. It doesn't distract from the viewing experience, nor is it like commentary tracks today in which cast and crew watch the film and just throw in offhand observations and an occasional chuckle. Enno Patalas' commentary in contrast is well-paced and highly respectful of both the film and the viewer.hand observations and an occasional chuckle.

0316666343|5.0|All I have is complements about this book.  My mother suggested that I read this book.  I am glad that she suggested it to me because it is one of the best books that I have read.  I am not an avid reader, in fact I don't enjoy it.  THE LOVELY BONES had my attention the whole way through.  I could barely put the book down.  I finished it within days.  <br />This touching story about a girl's family, friends, and community after she dies is very imaginative.  I like how Alice Sebold relates her characters together and how they were connected with Suzie Salmon.  <br />WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!!!!  This is a must read!
B000002UAX|5.0|It has great music!  I especially like Blackbird.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck's You Had It Coming is a great album. There is plenty of thick guitar tone and emotion to go around, and no one executes this the way Jeff Beck does. Mr. Beck also takes over most of the songwriting here, and it is nothing short of excellent. Overall, Jeff's musicianship makes up for the whole record.<br />Once again, Jeff Beck proves he is the master of guitar. &quot;Earthquake&quot; is the perfect opener for an album of this genre, and Jeff's ferocious guitar work leaves the listener either trying to do it himself or packing the guitar in forever (because no one's as good as the master!). &quot;Roy's Toy&quot; is the perfect song for the hot rodder (aka Motorhead) and Jeff's guitar phrasing and tone do not disappoint. Great beat as well. Next we come to &quot;Dirty Mind,&quot; one of the highlights of the record. This song is absolute wah bliss, and Jeff's phrasing is amazing. He packs so much power and feeling within his playing and still manages to be technically amazing as well. &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot; is the next track, and is perhaps the biggest surprise of the album. It is the only song on this album that features vocals, and Imogene Heap pulls them off with amazing skill. Her voice complements Jeff's guitar quite nicely.<br />Next we come to &quot;Nadia,&quot; the climax of the record. &quot;Nadia,&quot; as said by many others, is the standout and is one Mr. Beck's best tracks, ever. Everything fits here... his tone, his technique, his emotion, his delivery... this is the perfect guitar performance. It is not only astounding, it is also very beautiful, while not leaving you bored with a great beat backing Jeff up. An amazing song by an amazing guitar player that is worth the price of this album alone. Truly a 5 star song. After &quot;Nadia&quot; comes &quot;Loose Cannon,&quot; another excellent song. If you think your guitar tone and playing is mean and tough, give a listen to &quot;Loose Cannon.&quot; Jeff tears up the fretboard, while adding emotional quality. The solo in the middle and end of the song leaves one wondering if Mr. Beck is actually a human. &quot;Rosebud&quot; dispells that, proving that he cannot be to pull off such a fine performance. Jeff still has funk in his blood, and &quot;Rosebud&quot; has one of the best melodies and beats on the album, and it is sure to get you dancing, as well as singing along with it afterwards. &quot;Left Hook&quot; is next, and is one of the best songs on the record. Jeff's playing on this track is so very excellent, especially toward the fadeout. I'm guilty of turning my stereo up every time to try to get every note that Mr. Beck throws in. The next song, &quot;Blackbird,&quot; features some of Jeff's most awesome slide playing, ever. Here he jams along with a feathered friend, and neither disappoint the listener. &quot;Suspension&quot; is the closer of the disc, and is second best only to &quot;Nadia.&quot; Jeff's playing is so emotional and graceful on this track, and the backing instruments really do a nice job of complementing the playing. Astounding.<br />Overall, this is one of Jeff Beck's best, as well as one of rock guitar's best.. ever!
0743233832|5.0|I have read several translations of this great work..and without a doubt this is the finest available. What makes this the best is its ability to seem both classical and modern at the same time..in other words its not overly stuffy--nor is it distorted into &quot;New Age&quot; drivle. Don't think twice about buying this..you won't be dissapointed.
B0000026KQ|5.0|Guitar Shop is on par with the rest of Beck's work, and fits in nicely with \\"Wired\\" and \\"You Had It Coming\\" especially. It features some marvelous playing by all three band members, as well as wonderfully crafted songs.<br />Straight up, the best track on the CD is \\"Where Were You.\\" Ironic that the best tune on the album only really consists of Jeff and a little keyboards, but it is one of the most beautiful songs Mr. Beck has ever released. \\"Savoy,\\" \\"Behind the Veil,\\" and \\"Slingshot\\" are also worth mentions, and \\"Slingshot\\" is the perfect tune to close the album. A kick butt rocker to end a (much too short) kick butt album. Terry Bozzio's drumming and Tony Hymas' keyboards fit with Jeff's playing nicely, and they do a marvelous job complementing his playing (and adding to it). The dynamics of this CD are truly wonderful, to the high powered \\"Big Block\\" to the beautiful and tear-inducing \\"Where Were You\\" to the tough and awesome stomp of \\"Stand On It.\\" There is not a bad track on this album and it truly is an awesome outing by awesome players.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This is still one of the funniest movies ever made. It spoofs spy movies, World War II flicks AND 1950's musicals. Somehow this all works. Completely ridiculous and laden with sight gags, many have tried to emulate the formula of this film. See the atrociously unfunny \\"Spy Hard\\", the appropriately named \\"2001: A Space Travesty\\" and more recently, \\"Not Another Teen Movie!\\" and \\"Scary Movie 2.\\" <BR>\\"Top Secret\\" is still the ultimate silly movie. Because you see, it still manages to be funny. And a lot of the humor is completely spontaneous. The cow with jackboots, Chocolat Mousse drop kicking one of the Nazi's/East German Stormtroopers and yelling \\"Vive La France!\\" Hillary bidding everybody goodbye, but \\"I'll miss you most of all, Mr. Scarecrow!\\" Despite somehow managing to spoof three different genres, they still manage to spoof a whole bunch of movies, including \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" and the James Bond flicks. Ah, this is good stuff. ;-)
B00000I924|4.0|This album is perhaps one of rock's best comebacks. Jeff Beck fills his guitar with passion and beauty, as well as being technically astounding, and it's very refreshing, considering much of music today is stale and boring.<br />Stale and boring is one thing Who Else! is not. &quot;What Mamma Said&quot; is an explosive opener and fits with the sampled quote perfectly. &quot;Psycho Sam,&quot; one of the hightlights of the disc, is just what the title of the song says. It is a crazy, rocking song, and features some awesome playing by Mr. Beck as well as Jennifer Batten. &quot;Brush With the Blues,&quot; the third song, is one of the best tracks of Jeff's entire career. His tone is rich, his technique is right-on, and there is tons of emotion. The crazy-yet-beautiful solo in the middle is worth paying the money for this CD alone! Next, we cool off a bit with &quot;Blast from the East,&quot; another good track filled with odd time signatures and awesome tone. &quot;Space for the Papa&quot; is after that, and features some of Beck's coolest slide playing ever, which follows into &quot;Angel (Footsteps)&quot; which features even better slide playing! Beck never fails to amaze. &quot;Hip Notica&quot; is a fun tune and features some excellent organ-midi work by Ms. Batten. &quot;Even Odds&quot; is a great rocker and Jeff has a great, mean tone here. &quot;Declan,&quot; the 10th track, is one of the most beautiful moments of guitar playing I have ever heard. I cannot say more than that. &quot;Another Place&quot; is the perfect closer to this disc and is also very beautiful.<br />Overall, a great disc that proves Jeff Beck is back to stay. Rock on, Mr. Beck.
B000056K04|2.0|I was really disappointed with this. This sounds nothing like Dave. I like their music because it sounds fresh and displays the great talent they possess. This has Dave on electric guitar and sounds way over produced. I hope the next one is back to normal and if not, well I'm still huge fan of the older stuff.
6301934229|5.0|\\"The Hitcher\\" is one of my favorite movies, opening on a long stretch of desert highway, where Jim Halsey (played by C. Thomas Howell) is driving from Chicago to San Diego to deliver a car to some guy in California. On his way there, Jim picks up a hitchhiker, John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), who happens to be a serial killer. This suspenseful opening car scene has two of the most memorable quotes from the movie, starting off with Jim's first line: \\"My mother told me never to do this,\\" just moments before John pulls out a knife and threatens Jim with it, insisting he repeat four little words--\\"I want to die\\"--if he wants to live. With some quick thinking and reflexes, Jim narrowly escapes the knife-wielding lunatic, but is later tormented by John again, and is even mistaken as the serial killer by an army of police officers in their cruisers and helicopter.<br />While it's obvious John had wanted to kill Jim at first, he's now more interested in having Jim stop him, which is the basic drive of the movie, particularly at the end. He leaves a long trail of dead bodies, yet, at the same time, never harms Jim or the young waitress Jim befriends, Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh)--at least, not at first. But after some time, John uses Nash in one of his final attempts to get Jim's attention, by using a semi-truck as a rack and stretching her like a human turkey bone. This is one of the more memorable death scenes in this movie, though not visibly gruesome.<br />After this scene, I generally turn the movie off, even though there are several minutes left. The ending's a little out there, but it's a good example of character development on Jim's part, who matures from a naive young man into someone more bloodthirsty, almost a duplicate of John. His actions go far beyond survival; he becomes obsessed with physically stopping John. It makes you wonder how deep Jim's mind cracks at the end, which might be answered in the sequel (\\"The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting\\"), to be released next month, in March.<br />\\"The Hitcher\\" is a great psychological thriller, complete with a good cast--Hauer and Howell are perfect for their parts--and plenty of action, scares, and car chases. I wouldn't consider it a slasher film, since most of the killing occurs off-camera and is left up to the viewer to imagine--a much more effective method, I thought--but it does have its moments, like the human finger in the French fries bit. This movie will definitely make you think twice (if that much) before picking up a hitchhiker.
B000021XS0|5.0|I think the title explains it well enough. This album is the greatest album of all time. Every time i listen to it I'm blown away. Every time i listen to it i get chills because it's so good. First off i think concept albums are a fascinating concept (ha) and i really enjoy them. This one is definetly the best one i've ever heard. Dream Theater is a PHENOMENAL band. The guitar, drum, bass, keyboard, and vocal work on this cd are amazing. One reviewer (i THINK for this album) said, &quot;Grammy? Ha! This is worthy of a Nobel Prize!&quot; It's true. The talent is unspeakably good, all the songs are incredible, and they tell a story.<BR>1. Regression - 2 minute accoustic song, nice and relaxing to start the album<BR>2. Overture 1928 - GREAT instrumental song. Very catchy guitar work.<BR>3. Strange Deja Vu - awesome song. Nice and heavy, kind of haunting (There's a room at the top of the stairs/ Every night i'm drawn up there) i love that line..<BR>4. Through my words - very short song, just piano and vocals, but beautiful anyway<BR>5. Fatal Tragedy - spooky, heavy and melodic. Good lyrics (Write more songs, Myung!) EXCELLENT guitar and keyboard solos. 2nd best song on the album<BR>6. Beyond this Life - very heavy.. if you look in the cd pullout the lyrics are actually exactly whats written on the newspaper. Very cool. Great solos as well.<BR>7. Through her eyes - Call me soft, but i LOVE Dream Theater's slow songs just as much as the heavy ones. Fans dont seem to like this song if you look at other reviews.. but I do! check out the live version, its amazing.<BR>8. Home - VERY catchy chorus.. the indian citar kind of effect is weird but i like it, the only thing wrong with this song is the vocals in the beginning get to me (The ones where LaBrie holds the notes for like 7 seconds)<BR>9. The Dance of Eternity - Better instrumental than Overture 1928.. lovin the ragtime piano and the bass solo!<BR>10. One Last Time - Good song. There are better songs but this one is solid.<BR>11. The Spirit Carries on - FANTASTIC slow song. Killer solo and vocals.<BR>12. Finally Free - best song on the album. I love every note in this song. I'm not even exaggerating. <BR>There you have it, the best album of all time. GO GET IT! NOW!
B00005JLZL|3.0|This movie apparently has three goals. First, to provide a venue to oppose the death penalty. Second, to provide another offbeat role for Kevin Spacey. Three, to bash Texans in general and George W. Bush (by implication) in particular for their support for the death penalty and the number of executions carried out in the state.<br />Spacey plays David Gale, a former philosophy professor and supposedly outstanding teacher with a first class intellect who is on death row in Texas. Gale grants reporter Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) three interviews with him in the days before his execution. Ironically, he has been convicted of raping and murdering Constance Harraway (Laura Linney), his friend and fellow activist in Death Watch, a group opposing capital punishment. Bloom initially assumes Gale is guilty. However, as the interviews proceed in the three days before the scheduled execution, to the surprise of no one in the audience, she and her assistant Zack Stemmons (Gabriel Mann) uncover evidence that leads them to question the official version of events. The story unfolds in the form of flashbacks during the interviews with Gale, a technique which other reviewers have found distracting but that I felt was quite effective. As the movie unfolds, we learn additional complicating information, such as Harraway was dying of cancer at the time of her death and most importantly that Gale was an alcoholic who had already ruined his career and reputation due to an incident that occurred during a university party.<br />While this story relies on the dual mysteries of how Harraway really died and whether Gale will be executed, there is no mystery at all regarding the motive of the  director - to make a blantantly emotional and political appeal against the death penalty. He uses whatever techniques he can, including sexuality, strong language and reenactments of the crime almost at the level of snuff films. Kevin Spacey's performance is quite good, and as a whole I enjoyed the moviemore than AMERICAN BEAUTY (I am sure to be in the minority with that opinion) but not nearly as much as K-PAX. The rest of the characters were pretty unidimensional, although Leon Rippey as Braxton Belyeu, Gale's attorney, and Matt Craven as Dusty Wright, a shadowy figure around the edges of DeathWatch, were well cast for their ambiguous roles. As the movie unfolds and the convoluted details get sorted out, the general shape of the only possible outcome for this impassioned sermon becomes clear, but the exact nature of how the events transpired is kept secret until the end and a few of the details are actually quite clever.<br />If preaching about the immorality of the death penalty or the propaganda of liberal filmamkers will irritate you, don't see this movie. However, I am not a liberal and am not a blanket opponent of the death penalty, although I certainly recognize that it suffers from the problems of all human institutions. As a Kevin Spacey fan, I still found this movie entertaining, but felt that it's cleverness actually made it a less effective witness against the death penalty than the real life stories of people wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated and freed, including someone with whom I was personally acquainted. So this film is worthwhile if you are willing to simply watch a film with an interesting story while accepting the idea on which it is based at face value - it is a quite tense action movie. But if you want a great story, wonderful performances, moving screenwriting and a movie likely to inspire multiple viewings, this is defintely not it.
0060955775|4.0|When Veronika decides to commit suicide it is not from profound depression but from boredom and emptiness. When she wakes up from her overdose she finds herself in an old fashioned literary \\"asylum\\" where the treatments are--to say the least--unorthodox. There she learns that she has damaged her heart and will in fact die in little more than a week. And from there, the parable unfolds.<br />Faced with the real possibility of death, Veronika begins to appreciate life. The author develops his theme artfully. Follow your vision, he says, live in the moment, make the most of your fleeting time. Do not waste your life trying to meet the expectations of others, but do what you have always dreamed of doing.<br />Unfortunately the author is just a bit heavy-handed in making these points. The story of Veronika's commitment to a mental hospital is a very personal issue with author Coelho--indeed he himself makes a brief appearance in the story to underline this point. I wish he had been more subtle and let the readers draw their own conclusions. Still, the book is readable, lucid and charming. I recommend it. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I loved this movie!!  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. My all time favorite movie is Sabrina with Harrison Ford and Emma is now right along side.  This is a movie that just makes you smile all the way through and leaves you with a tingle when it is over.  It's not a movie for anyone other than those who like the light romantic movies of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts.  I fell in love with Jeremy Northam.  He is absolutely gorgeous! Buy this movie--you will watch it over and over and love it more each time!
B000002H97|5.0|I'm tired of everyone saying \\"this is the end of Metallica as a metal band\\". Metallica started playing classic style metal instead of speed. Yes it's metal. Thrash is such limiting a style, Metallica wanted to change. They knew they could be one of the greatest heavy metal bands ever, up there with bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Van Halen, and Aerosmith. They didn't sell out, they got MUCH better. Metallica reached their best level with this classic. It's good traditional metal. Lars Ulrich is a good solid drummer. The guitar solos are superb. The band learned that if you play mid-tempo songs with groove and melody, you can be great. The people who hate this album don't like good heavy metal. They like thrash metal. Metallica was always different from bands like Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, and Exodus. They were always more like bands like Motorhead then the above bands they got compared too. THIS IS THE REAL METAL!!!
B000001A3H|4.0|This is an amazing album.  When I first heard of Kyuss, I heard the buzz words \\"stoner rock\\" and \\"queens of the stone age\\".  So when I picked up this album I was expecting a sloppy unprofessional sounding albeit fun album.  Much to my surprise this album turned out to be a very strong mixture of well-rehearsed KILLER rock songs.  There are very few parts on this album that sound improvised.  There are also very few lame lyrics.  This sounds more like Tool meets The Smashing Pumpkins than traditional \\"stoner rock\\" such as The Black Crows.  And thats a good thing.  My favorite tracks are  the fun \\"Thong Song\\", the deep instrumental \\"Apothecaries' Weight\\", the pretty \\"Capsized\\", and the rockin' \\"Green Machine\\".  However I only give this album a 4 star because some of the songs seem like filler, or perhaps I should just listen to it more.  Well, Rock and Roll Kyuss!
B000002OMN|5.0|Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell 2 is an excellent summer masterpiece with classics like Wasted Youth, Everything Louder Than Everything Else,Lost Boys and Golden Girls,Life Is A Lemon,I Would Do Anything For Love,Objects in the rearview mirror,It Just Wont Quit, Rock And Roll Dreams come through,Good Girls Go To Heaven and Out Of The Frying Pan and Into The Fire.Just all of the songs basically. The dialouge before Wasted Youth is hilarious and then it kicks up with a killer rythm and Meat Loafs emotionally dramatic and awesome voice.Life Is A Lemon is a nihilistic little masterwork. I Would Do Anything For Love is long and fantastic but the song Objects In The Rearview Mirror is an excellent story and Meat Loafs masterpiece despite the corny title.

B00006JKON|1.0|It's really a pity Ian Anderson took the unfavorable reviews of &quot;A Passion Play&quot; to heart. It's true its play-within-the-play is a bit tedious, but over all each Jethro Tull record from &quot;This Was&quot; to &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, very much including &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, was an improvement on its predecessor. (I'm not counting &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, a collection of out-takes.) <br />Not so with &quot;War Child&quot;. &quot;War Child&quot; is much worse than any previous Jethro Tull record (including &quot;Living in the Past&quot;). I assumed at the time--and nothing that has happened since has convinced me otherwise--that the group was simultaneously giving up artistically and cashing in (selling out) commercially with the insipid single &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;. <br />If Mr. Anderson was THAT upset about the reaction to &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, he ought to have disbanded his group rather than subjected us to the sludge we find here.<br />Note: I'm not familiar with the &quot;bonus tracks&quot; (what an ugly term), but it's reasonable to assume that since they were cut from the original release that they are likely inferior to the &quot;tracks&quot; that were not cut, disingenuous liner notes notwithstanding.
0425173755|4.0|Murder on the Orient Express is one of the best books I've ever read.  This book is exciting from the beginning and only gets better.  Hercule Poirot has to work through the evidence to find the real murderer or murderers of the crime.  With alittle help from his friend M. Bouc, Poirot decides who's telling the truth and who is guilty of murder.  If you like mysteries and you like justice you will like this book.  I recommend this to all readers.  It is an easy book to read that you never want to put down.

B000002VDW|5.0|Some have praised this album while downplaying the two hit songs it contains, but I think they each fit in nicely.  &quot;Time Passages&quot; is the perfect opener, inviting you, the listener, to open up your mind and listen to Al tell some stories.  &quot;Song on the Radio,&quot; while it may be a bit of a stretch thematically, provides a nice uptempo kick near the end of the album, gently bringing us back into the here and now.  I was not a fan of either of these songs when they were hits, but after buying the album years later I was able to appreciate them much more.  <br />And they are not the only great songs here.  &quot;Palace of Versailles&quot; and &quot;The Man for All Seasons&quot; are excellent examples of how Stewart was able to fuse American folk and rock styles with distinctly European themes.  &quot;Almost Lucy,&quot; &quot;Acadian Skies,&quot; and &quot;End of the Day&quot; are mostly acoustic, and harken back to Stewart's earlier, more personal work.  <br />I love to listen to Al Stewart's music, particularly this album, while travelling.  Stewart is obviously an observant, enthusiastic traveller who also has an appreciation of the comforts of home, and his attitude is infectious.
B00005JL3A|5.0|First off, for all the real Resident Evil fans who love the video game. You will not be disappointed by this movie. The detail gone into the sets like the mansion, the zombie dogs, the sound effects, even the way some of the characters talk is like Resident Evil-the game. The music is innovative, exciting and moves the movie along nicely. Each scene is filled with action and there is not a scene in the movie that is slow or bogs the movie down.Mansons music is great.Milla Jovovich is perfect as the lead kick arse character Alice. Michelle Rodriquez is excellent as the tough as nails Rain. Not one actor is miss casted in this film. I'm so glad director Paul W.S. Anderson did the film right, justice has prevailed. When I first heard that a Resident Evil movie was getting made I instantly thought that some hot new upcoming actors would be cast ie( No this can't happen), but no I was over the moon and over joyed when I found out that Milla Jovovich- one of THE BEST ACTORS around and of her generation,was going to play the lead. I then knew that this film had a chance of being grouse. So if your thinking of buying this film, it is a diffinite must for any fan of the genre. The extras are worth it and the commentary is excellent and very funny.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|The air of creepy dread in \\"Donnie Darko\\" is pitched just right.  The movie plays with the conventions of teen comedy and teen horror movie without falling into the traps of either.  Jake Gyllenhaal generates real sympathy for a character that could have easily been just another Holden Caufield variant.  The tricky plot keeps you guessing.  The movie is also the first period piece whose period is the late 1980's, which has got to count for something.  \\"Donnie Darko\\" is totally worth watching once.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of watching it twice within the space of a few days, and the second viewing diminished the charm of the first.  Suddenly the teen angst was too heavy, and the loose ends I had found teasingly enigmatic seemed merely sloppy.  Then I made the even worse mistake of watching a few scenes with the commentary turned on.  Director Richard Kelly is a young guy with a dopey voice who clearly identifies with the put upon Donnie.  The gap between what he thought he was doing and what actually came across killed whatever mystery was left.<br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" is Richard Kelly's first movie, and I'm eager to see what he does next.  He's got more visual panache and interesting ideas than most people out there.  If \\"Donnie Darko\\" doesn't hold together, it's mostly because he tried to put too much of a good thing into one package.  You can still get your money's worth out of this movie, but you have to know what to do with it: watch it once, and take it back to the video store.
0884271536|5.0|This book was absolutely phenomenal.  The storybook style of Goldratt made this a superbly easy read, much UNLIKE typical tech manuals.  The ideas can be implemented in any business &amp; I loved the examples of various project types that crossed numerous boundaries too!
B00003CX9S|5.0|A sentimental, touching and inspiring movie.  Marvelous performance by John Hart as the disfigured John Merrick - the Elephant Man and by Anthony Hopkins as Dr Fred Treves.  The movie was shot in Black & White as determined by Director David Lynch, although it was produced in 1980.  I guess it's to establish the mid 19th centuries atmosphere and to give it much impacts to the audiences.<br />Imagine you're the Elephant Man and visualize how you survive in this cruel world !
B00006RAKP|4.0|This is a great collection of Elton John songs.  Think of what it does include, not what it leaves out.  No Greatest Hits CD will ever please everyone.  This one, however, does a pretty good job.  Most of his greatest songs from the 70s are included.  Great songs from the years after that are included as well.  Elton John fans will not be disappointed.  You can't find two discs with a better collection of hits.
B00006C7G9|5.0|You want a lump in your throught at times,maby some goose bumps,and tears.You will get to know some real Americans,who did their duty.A few of them are still alive.I can only say thank you to the ones that gave all of their future,so we could have today.
B000001FO5|4.0|With songs like &quot;Gypsy Road&quot; and &quot;Take Me Back&quot; it's hard not to like the album. From first song to last it is a great album. Some songs like &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; are a little bit too light for me and that's what keeps me from rating it higher, but that's just my opinion.
B000068TSI|5.0|This is a must see.A very moveing film.It touches all of the right feelings.Not a film for left wingers.
B000001DVE|3.0|The album has a few shining moments but what I heard was lacking overall. &quot;Bringin on the Heartbreak&quot; was good and some of the other songs I was starting to feel for but I just couldn't fully get it. With more time I may have liked it better. Not a bad album at all, a sign of better Leppard to come.
B00003CXE7|3.0|This movie was a little to bloody for my taste. The performances by Russel Crowe, Connie Nelson and Joaquin Phoenix (spelling?) were really good though. It's a good action \ drama movie. I especially liked the music and plan on getting the soundtrack. I recommend this movie to people who like action movies that take place in Ancient Greece \ Roman times.
B000000OQG|5.0|This album is what rock is all about. Enough can't be said about it. If you haven't heard it yet you've been missing out on a lot. Every song is excellent and makes you want more. Every song takes you on a new journey and in a different direction. Axl, Izzy, Stephen, Slash, and Duff make a lineup only most bands can dream of.<br />The sooner you get it the happier you'll be.
B000001FS3|5.0|This album is simply their best in my opinion.  &quot;Bullet The Blue Sky&quot; is amazing as is &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;.  &quot;In God's Country&quot; is hauntingly beautiful and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; is another classic.<br />This is one of the best albums ever made by any artist, period.  They're all great songs.  Excellent from the beginning to the end!
B000002INS|3.0|I got into Skid Row because I heard songs like &quot;Youth Gone Wild,&quot; &quot;18 and Life,&quot; and &quot;I Remember You&quot; on the radio quite a bit. The songs are great but I've heard them so many times it takes away what was great about them. A few other songs like &quot;Piece of Me&quot; are good but just not enough to make it great, not a bad listen if you're into Hair Metal though.
6305428522|4.0|The most shocking American scandal of the late 1950s was the revelation that the top-rated game shows on television -- especially NBC's \\"Twenty One\\" -- were rigged to provide maximum drama and to keep ratings high. Today, events from boxing matches to political \\"town meetings\\" to wars are routinely scripted to...well, provide maximum drama (or propaganda) and to keep ratings high. The ruckus over fixing quiz shows seems positively quaint by comparison.<br />But it did happen, and provides the basis for Robert Redford's excellent \\"Quiz Show.\\" The movie centers around three characters: Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a Jewish Everyman from Queens who rules \\"Twenty One\\" for seven weeks until he is ordered to deliberately flub an easy question as his appeal has \\"plateaued;\\" Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a poetry teacher at Columbia who is seduced by the lure of money and fame into being the show's new favorite son; and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow), a Congressional investigator who digs deeper into the muck.<br />Turturro provides a tragic figure as a man who can't accept that he has been tossed aside like a used dishrag. Fiennes provides another sort of tragic figure as a man who is pathetically eager to embrace his newfound fame, even if he did come by it dishonestly. David Paymer and Hank Azaria, as the show's anything-for-ratings producers, almost (but not quite) make the deception sound like a harmless embellishment as they tempt Van Doren into throwing away his ethical standards. All are terrific. Morrow, however, just isn't very convincing, especially not with an exaggerated and clearly fake Boston accent, and he ends up undermining whatever scenes in which he appears.<br />For his part, Redford claims to have recognized that Van Doren was acting a part when the show was originally on the air, and that it was thus faked. True or not, it gave him the inspiration to make a movie about the time when TV lost its innocence, and the way we look at the idiot box has never quite been the same.
B00000DFMN|5.0|My mother purchased this album (LP format) for me in 1984.  I played it so much that I literally wore out the label, the album cover and some parts of the vinyl itself.  Luckily I was able to get another copy and my only disappointment was that the label design was not of the style that was on the vinyl when the album was initially released (Island Records had gone to a new graphic design).  This was the beginning of my fascination with England (I had seen the music video for &quot;Beat Box&quot; before getting the album and was amazed!)  At the risk of sounding just like the other reviewers &quot;Moments In Love&quot; has to be one of the greatest slow songs ever made.  I would be keen to use the song at my wedding!  The awesome thing about the album is the group's ability to take ordinary sounds and generate really good musical compositions.  My other favorite is &quot;Who's Afraid (Of The Art Of Noise)&quot;.  It is so much fun to listen and dance to!  The same goes for &quot;Realization&quot;.<br />Get the album.  You'll love it!
B000001Y5J|4.0|Very good NIN ep that you could really just call an lp. I mean, there are alot of lp's with 9 tracks, and this has 8. Anyway, like others have pointed out, Trent seems a bit angry on this one. Broken reminds me of Ministry's album &quot;Psalm 69&quot;, in that it's mostly fast and loud with alot of guitar on it. Definitely the most &quot;metal&quot; sounding overall of NIN's output. Some copies of Broken come with tracks 1-6 on the disc, and tracks 7-8 on a 3 inch mini-disc. I assume the initial copies. Cool to have unless you want them all on the same cd. Either way, Broken is as essential as any NIN before or afterwards.
B00007JMCX|4.0|You really can't get more '70s than this film by Nicolas Roeg. Made in 1976, it really captures much of the futuristic and negative aspects of 1970's thinking along with other '70s classics as &quot;Logans Run&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. All of these films have a decidedly negative flair until &quot;Star Wars&quot; was released a year later and a new positive style of adventure was introduced in a more traditional manner.<br />This new &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD is a beautiful print - sharp focus and deep rich colors. There's hardly any grain and the soundtrack is full and rich. I'd never seen this movie look so good to be honest with you, and the dull muted VHS versions out there do not do the film justice. I never really liked this movie UNTIL I saw the DVD version that was just released. Suddenly, it took on a whole new meaning for me.<br />I recommend this film, although a bit too &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; for its good at times and certainly a bit too cerebral (it may have done well to learn a thing or two from Star Wars if it had been released just a year later). Sometimes simplicity works best and this story is anything but simple. Parts of it do work however, and Bowie gives a brilliant performance considering this was his first ever acting role in major motion picture. He looks better than he acts, but then this role needs a more interesting looking person than a well-acted one.<br />Interesting, fascinating film that encompasses much of the attitude of the 1970's. I highly recommend it to the curious.
B00006CXGM|1.0|I have the original DVD version of this movie and the Superbit version. I cannot tell the difference between either. Resolution and sound are equal, at least to me. My rating is not for the movie, which is hilarious. It is for what I perceive to be a lie perpetuated by Columbia that Superbit is a superior DVD choice when, in fact, it appears to be nothing more than a re-packaged version of the same. I have not compared all original DVD versions currently available in Superbit, but again, where is the incentive since I already feel ripped off.
B0000524CY|4.0|Now, without a doubt, The Exorcist is one of the greatest horror films ever made.  This film showed that horror films could actually be &quot;good&quot; oscar-worthy, and epic.  I love schlock and B films, but Exorcist gave horror a good(or bad depending on the person you ask)name.  I find this to be one of the finest the genre has to offer, but I'm not so sure about the new version.  I think I'm in the same category of hardcore Star Wars fans who didn't care much for the special editions.  If you ask me, it's pretty ballsy to mess with a classic, coz you really run the risk of upsetting alot of people.  I didn't think it was too bad really.  In fact, most of it I could deal with okay, but there was one thing I just couldn't:  The dreaded &quot;Spider walk.&quot;  I think that really ruined it.  Not only was it totally out of place at that point in the movie, but it looked so corny.  Having Reagan come out of her room and attack was premature.  Why didn't she do it again, or any ol' time she pleased?  Why did she do it the first time?  How did they get her back to her room?  Did she voluntarily go back to her room?  Since we're dealing with an old film that we can't reshoot, there is no footage in the original film to explain that scene.  Why was it never talked about again?  Don't you think Ellen Burstyn would have brought up this rather bizarre episode to the doctors or the priest?  Well, like I said, I could deal with the extra dialogue, spooky phantom flashes and the hint of CGI, but that spider walk has just got to go.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Disney and PIXAR strikes gold yet again with &quot;Monster's Inc.&quot;, the story of what happens in the world behind the closet door. There, you'll find Monstropolis, a place where creatures of all shapes and sizes live everyday normal lives, where all the energy in the city comes from screams, and where human children are considered toxic. The plot is set in motion when a big, blue monster named Sully brings a little girl named Boo into the monster world and turns it upside-down. Like in &quot;Toy Story&quot;, PIXAR brings a nostalgic twist to the film which makes it not only a &quot;kiddie movie&quot;, but equally enjoyable to grown-ups who remember when they thought there were monsters in their closet. The DVD also features an assortment of special bonus features, most notably deleted scenes, art galleries, theatrical trailers. and a full version of the original story concept for the film which only somewhat resembles the final product. In all, I would defiantly recommend this DVD, but it does not quite compare to their previous &quot;Toy Story&quot; film
1400031362|5.0|Mma Ramotswe and her assistant, Mma Makutsi have a problem--or rather a series of problems. Thanks to her impending marriage to Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, Mma Ramotswe has a chance to move the office of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, saving money. But even so, the agency is losing too much--and Makutsi would hate to have to let her assistant go. When Mr. J.L.B. Makekoni loses interest in his auto repair shop, Ramotswe sets up Mma Makutsi as assistant manager--but that doesn't deal with the issue of why Makekoni has lost interest in his shop (problem one). Then there's the government man who's convinced that his sister-in-law is trying to poison his brother (problem two). Next, there's a child found with the scent of lion on him, speaking no known language (problem three). Finally, a beauty contest manager comes to the agency with the problem of deciding which of his contestants is least likely to be connected with vice, theft, or other sponsor-offending defects (problem four). Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi definitely have their hands full.<br />Author Alexander McCall Smith uses an almost fairy-tale touch to tell his story of families, culture clash, and ordinary people in Botswana, Africa. Smith emerges the reader in African urban culture immediately, letting the western reader come across differences and similarities to their own background in a natural and convincing way. His light touch (I especially liked Mma Ramotswe's description of herself as having a 'traditional' figure) adds frequent smiles to the journey.<br />MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is not a complex mystery. In particular, I would have liked to see a better integration of the lion-child into the story. It is, however, a charming story of Africa, women trying to make their way in a culture that is quickly changing yet that maintains many of the values of the past, and of simply getting along with one another as they gain deeper insights into people. MORALITY is a quick read--but if you're like me, you'll find yourself thinking about it again and again once you're done.'ll find yourself thinking about it again and again once you're done.
B000001EHS|4.0|Being in high school in the late 80's, I thought Def Leppard was  matched only by Motley Crue and Van Hagar. Truly great pop-metal. Overall a good collection. I realize that Def Lep wanted to present the &quot;hits&quot; only, but I think it's too bad they didn't show the whole picture. Though I like them all, SIX tracks from Hysteria? That's half that album. And nothing from the first record? I would haved loved to seen &quot;Hello America&quot; or something from that. You'd think it's inclusion would benefit everybody. Just 1 from High n'Dry too. At least Pyromania is represented by 3 songs. Plenty of ballads, though I'm sure somebody wishes there were more. But on the positive side, what IS here is mostly classic Leppard that will make you def. Now where did I put my British flag muscle shirt?
B00005JM1D|5.0|This movie was great. It was a laugh a minute movie about a guy who just bought a house near a university with his two friends. The college dean realizes that those three guys picked on him whem he was little so the dean says that the house is the universitys property. In order to save his house he starts a sorority. Over all it was hysterical and I recommend it to anybody who would love a good laugh.
0375414053|3.0|There were a lot of moments in this book that working moms (including myself) could relate to, many of which were just laugh-out-loud funny. But there were also moments where I just wanted to slap Kate and tell her to either get a new job, get her lazy husband to help, or just relax and not get caught up in the whole status-parenting trap.<br />I mean, OK, so Kate Reddy has a high-stress job that requires long hours and frequent travel. She also has a husband whose job doesn't seem so demanding. Why can't he pick up some of the workload at home? When the baby cries in the middle of the night, if I were her, I'd whack my husband in the ribs until he woke up and I'd tell him to go give the baby a bottle! If one spouse--male or female--has such a demanding, high-paying job, then the other one should handle most of the work at home!!!
B000000H40|5.0|This is the way Death Metal was meant to be.... Ok if his voice was to high for Death Metal,than so is Chuck Schuldiners voice,Cause John Tardy did basically the same vocal style,half scream,half growl,which we all know Chuck Schuldiners voice was awsome,so Johns is just as good if not better,I mean Chuck was a great vocalist,and im a big fan of his,but Tardys vocals just own,This is the way Death Metal was meant to be,along with Suffocation,Malevolent Creation,Death,....,Grindcore is just boring,and repetive,I love ALL Obituarys albums,but Slowly We Rot,and Cause Of Death are my favs,Also check out some old Sepultura,Suffocation,Death,Malevolent Creation,peace.
B00006GEXQ|3.0|THis is avery good British movie, with the American Pie directors handling the wheel.<br />Hugh Grant plays himself one more time, but, in this one, he manages to be at least likeable and sympathetic.
B000063DFN|5.0|I love iron maiden and no one's collection will be complete if you don't own this. It's a great cd and I have no intention in ever throwing it out. There is not one bad song on it, so that means this album is one of my favorites. I really would have givin this ten stars if I could. I recomend this to anyone who is an iron maiden fan.
B00005YW4H|3.0|...Diana Krall for a real jazz experience. I love this womans voice but give me some range. Please just stretch a little out of the soothing, cool, raspy voice, sultry as it is. I can't wait for the next several CD's to see if she has legs to keep the pace at a run.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I bought this CD and while I found it mildly enjoyable - it is hardly deserving of the effusive reviews nor is Miss. Jones to be compared to Billie Holiday. She lacks the sophisticated improvisations, versatility, and interpretative talent of a true jazz musician. While she is certainly talented her delivery is uninspired at best. <BR>I understand that this is her first album and perhaps her potential will be developed on future releases or perhaps not...<BR>At any rate, I've put aside this CD since I found it disappointing and have taken refuge in the exceptional talents of her label mate - Cassandra Wilson.....
B00005JLXC|4.0|I recently had the chance to see daredevil and i thought it was great maybe not quite as good as spider man but very close. i loved the fight scenes and thought Affleck portrayed daredevil very believable. Jennifer Garner was very good and also very hot and Colin Farrell also had agreat performance. Over all it was a great movie and i would recommend it to anyone
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is without a doubt the best record of 2002 and so far the best album of the 00's, hands-down.<br />This album is at the same time exciting, boring, prophetic, gripping, and just plain good.  It seems that many negative reviewers didn't give this album a chance.  Saying that it has no good riffs or rhythms is a joke (listen to the 1-2 punch of Heavy Metal Drummer and I'm The Man Who Loves You).<br />YHF is everything you loved about the NoDep movement combined with the sonic adventurism of Radiohead and Sonic Youth.  The songs are moving (another 1-2 punch is Jesus, etc. and Ashes of American Flags), and some are meant to frustrate you, but the whole of this album makes it worth it.<br />Keep listening to it until Poor Places blows your mind, then maybe you'll understand what every critic in the world is thinking.
B000003CMB|5.0|The Allman Brothers Band blended jazz, blues, and southern rock to create some of the finest rock ever recorded, and Live At The Filmore East is a testament of their powers.<br />The concert at Filmore East, NY in July '71 shows the Allmans playing tighter than any band before or since. There are three long improvisational pieces on here, all exceeding 10 minutes--You Don't Love Me, In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed, and an incredible 23-minute rendition of Whipping Post. None of them drag or feel overly long, and this is coming from a person that was raised on a steady diet of three-minute punk and radio rawk. So by that estimation, I can say that this album is VERY good. The rest of the album consists of blues jams (Statesboro Blues, Done Somebody Wrong) and blistering instrumentals (Stormy Monday, Hot 'Lanta). Duane and Dickey Betts lay down some of the best guitar performances ever, Gregg's vocals and piano work are great, and the two (!) drummers never let up for a second.<br />While this recording is great throughout, my favorite moment is toward the end of You Don't Love Me, where the band suddenly drops a few bars of &quot;Joy To The World.&quot; It's another spark of brilliance in an album full of them.<br />Live At The Filmore East has few equals in the live album category. This one ranks up there with The Who's Live At Leeds, Jimi Hendrix's Band Of Gypsys, and The MC5's Kick Out The Jams as far as I'm concerned. If you love live classic rock, Live At The Filmore East is essential listening.
B00008BXJ6|3.0|The new digipak &quot;High Voltage&quot; release was remastered by Sony.  Does it sound good?  Yes, it does.  Does it sound any better than the 1994 remaster?  I can't tell a difference, other than it being a little louder.  The pictures in the liner notes of the original Australian &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;TNT&quot; album releases are nice, but how often do you look at liner notes?<br />Hardcore AC/DC fans be warned!  The track &quot;It's a Long Way To the Top&quot; has been shortned by about 15 seconds.  If you have the 1994 release, stick with that.  The sound is just as good, and you'll have the full version of the song.
0553801511|5.0|Robin Hobb has been my favorite author ever since I picked up the first Assassin book. I didn't particularly enjoy Fool's Errand as much as I did her other two series, but Golden Fool was a wonderful improvement! Many new surprises were revealed just when you think there couldn't be anything more, and I'm looking VERY forward to the last book.. although things are starting to seem like the last book will be a bit rushed like the last one was in the Assassin series. I don't want it to end!
B00001NFCY|5.0|Since I brought this record in 1999, I haven't stop listen it, for many years i was listening a lot of music, but when i saw Higher video for the firs time, they got me and i said &quot;I definitly need to have this record on my collection&quot; ,and  yes it's there best album the first one it's very good, also Weathered made me think that there's nothing beyond creed in music............
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is the best CD ive ever listened to. Its fun, emotional, and it caters to many tastes. Listening to it makes you wanna dance, and fills you with happiness. The russian songs are jsut as good or better than the english ones, and the english ones are mind blowing. You must buy this CD, you will be very sorry if you dont.
B00003CWL6|3.0|With an opening voiceover stolen directly from Sunset Boulevard, this film is pretty typical of undeserving movies that win The Big Prize. Spacey and Bening are a fairly loathsome couple, only sympathetic intermittently. The truly compelling aspect of the film resides in the family next door: father Chris Cooper, mother Allison Janney, and son Wes Bentley. What goes on in this household is the true stuff of moviemaking. Janney who has achieved much-deserved fame as a result of her role on The West Wing has been around quite a while, turning in flawless performances each time out of the gate. But what she does in American Beauty, with only a few lines of dialogue, is simply awe-inspiring. I came away from this film positively stricken by her performance which is a masterpiece of understated acting. The same is true of Chris Cooper (who is, at last, getting much-deserved recognition for his fine talent) in the role of a man trying to contain massive fears about his true identity. And Wes Bentley is terrific, dark and defiant, as the son of this household.<br />If you take a step back and look closely at the Spacey character, what you see is perilously close to pedophelia--a man lusting after an underage girl. That it's covered in rose petals doesn't make it any more palatable. Yes there are some good scenes but it doesn't alter the core thesis that a middle-aged man, fed up with his awful family, makes drastic changes to his life because he is hopelessly drawn to a teenage girl.<br />Watch this one for the Janney, Cooper, Bentley performances. They're worth the time. The rest of this prize-winner is derivative--an apple with a worm at its core.
B000059MEK|5.0|This is my first Daft Punk cd but not my last.  Unbelievable music, I can't stop playing it.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|Memnto is impressive but in the end it dosen't leave much of an impression. Like a day in Leonard's life, it slips easily from memory, favoring sensation over insight and frisson of artificial confusion over any contemplation of human reality. Leonard's tatoos and photographs are a poor and unreliable substitute for the thick confusion of memory and Memento for all it's undeniable formal dazzle, is a triumph of mind in the absence of matter.
B00006F83Y|4.0|i've never written a review for an album before...but after reading a guy saying this ablum is overhyped i had to chime in.  i too bought into the hype after waiting months for a friend to mail me the cd...i couldn't wait any longer. i was afraid because i think dave grohl IS overhyped and predictible and so i figured it was going to be very foo.  its not foo.  but the haters are right, these guys aren't taking a lot of chances or breaking a lot of rules.  and i like rule breaking.  but they have a right to be cocky, they are better than the ... that is on mainstream radio.  they do hard and catchy SO GOOD.  if you want rock n roll to die or you refuse to listen to anything that you didn't know about the day it came out DON'T BUY THIS.  otherwise, crank up songs for the deaf ITS STILL OK TO ROCK ! ! !
B000089CKH|5.0|There is a world where music equals canned fast food, unquestioned mass consumption, apathy, and ideological and emotional void. Where records proprietorship is meant to keep up with the Joneses and show off. In this world there is a total lack of intellect and taste. What prevails is the vulgarization of  human nature in order to sell more. Simply brand a marketing product without a real need of artistic expression. If you belong to this part of the world, if you do not understand the difference between playing music and making music, I highly advise you not to listen to Nada Surf's Let Go.<br /><br />Let Go shows a mature and cultured band in one of their best moments, it is not for all, not for the banal and vulgar but for the sensible, sensitive, and wise. Let Go fulfils the space within: our innermost nature, human and sensible.<br /><br />Lyrics and chords intertwine to paint a clear picture of feeling and emotion, the kind we all feel when looking inwards. Each one of the 13 tracks will bring the listener to a particular catharsis, a new dimension.<br /><br />Every time I play the Cd, I hear details I haven't heard before, a higher sustain, the back vocal, echoes, undertones to a brilliant songwriting. I can sense the performance of Ira Elliot's at the moment, and its drumming geniality, Daniel Lorca's bass creativity permeates all and transpires in La Pour Ca, and finally Matthew Caws' weeping guitar and earnest voice sound sometimes joyful,  always dreamy, and yet furious and truthful to all the emotion it meant to convene.<br /><br />Each song is a surprise. I predict this Cd will be a collector's item; a rare and polished gem of what our culture produces best.<br /><br />Music for thirsty  & wise souls.
B00007K08H|4.0|Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tatou) is an attractive but introverted young woman from a highly dysfunctional family; in flashbacks we see her parents give her a camera and then tell her after a car accident that her photography caused it. Her family life is so bad even her pet goldfish has suicidal tendencies. But Amelie finds herself finally freed from these burdens when her mother commits suicide.<BR>Flash forward five years later to late 1997 and Amelie is working as a waitress. However hearing the news of Princess Diana's death changes her life forever and she decides to devote herself to being a self appointed guardian angel, subtly changing people's lives for the better (or worse) without their knowledge. But despite these noble (Yet somehow, below the surface; megalomaniacal) efforts, Amelie remains living in her dream world. Can she find the love and happiness for herself that she so passionately seeks for others? <BR>AMELIE is sometimes pretentious, but mostly a very unique and charming fable which effortlessly mixes fantasy and whimsy, with a wonderful lead performance from Tatou. Directed by Jean Pierre Jeunet, best known for DELICATESSEN and ALIEN RESURRECTION. This is well worth your time. I avoided renting AMELIE for ages because the cover and concept screamed ARTHOUSE CHICK FLICK, but thankfully the movie is far from it. Normally I'd hate this type of movie, but AMELIE is different. I'd even go so far as to say it's actually quite special. Well worth checking out.
0684801558|5.0|The genius of F.Scott Fitzgerald shines brilliantly in this vastly underappreciated classic novel of moral depravity.  The pervasive themes of Fitzgerald include moral corruption, profligate behavior, agnosticism, selfishness, narcissism, egocentrism, and of course, a sick obsession with money and alcohol.  These themes permeate all too well throughout the beautifully written The Beautiful and Damned(pardon the pun).<br />Released in 1922, 2 years subsequent to the seminal This Side of Paradise and 3 years prior to the magnum opus The Great Gatsby, incomprehensibly, The Beautiful and Damned was not well received critically nor financially.  As a result, history has erroneously filed it under the dubious sophomore jinx category.  Strange it may seem, I vehemently disagree.  As you read this book, you witness first-hand the maturation of an amazing writer.  No American writer of the 20th Century can compare to the profound power and unwavering genius that is F.Scott Fitzgerald.  If you enjoyed The Great Gatsby, you will no doubt enjoy this work - an equally beautifully writen and tragic tale of aspiring morally depraved young Americans in pursuit of The American Dream.<br />\\"Remarkable that a person can comprehend so little and yet live in such a complex civilization.\\"

B000068G9X|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums,as well as one of Danzigs best! After Samhain Bassist Eerie Von and the mighty \\"Misfit\\" in black, \\"Glenn Danzig\\", teamed up with producer Rick Rubin, (& his Def American label) as well as former Black Flag,Circle Jerks, (million other punk bands) drummer Chuck Biscuits and an unknown,(yet accomplished) guitar player named \\"John Christ\\" to make what is one of the very best hard rock/Blues albums of the eighties. I love every song onb hear but the faves are Am I a Demon,Twist of cain,She Rides,not of this world and soul on fire,and of course everyone knows about \\"MOTHER\\"!! I think the production could of been better (ya know some more bass) but other than that I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000WFF|5.0|This cd is one of their best. It has great tracks (Stop, Too Much, Viva Forever). The songs have fantastic lyrics and great beats. Some are good to dance to and some are slow and relaxing. This cd has something for everyone...as long as you still like the Spice Girls. Some songs could have had more meaning and been deeper but overall this is a great cd. It has the lyrics with it so u can sing along and have fun. Ya gotta have it!

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is one of the most diverse and powerful albums I've ever heard. With tracks like \\"I'm OK\\", \\"Beautiful\\", and \\"Stripped (Pts. 1&2)\\", Christina basically shares her entire life with you, which she didn't do on her debut album. On the flip side, theres fun party songs like \\"Dirrty (Featuring Redman)\\", \\"Infatuation\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us Down (Featuring Lil Kim)\\" and then there is also 'half&half' songs like \\"Fighter(my personal favorite)\\" & \\"Cruz\\".

B00000272N|5.0|With the age of grunge far gone, there are albums that are just pure nostalgia, and Alice In Chains's album 'Facelift' is one of those albums. With this being of those records that is pure American rock and roll, you can just put this on and enjoy it. Layne's vocals are perfect, Jerry's guitars are great, and the whole all around feel of the albums is great. This is one record that I can still listen to after I have had it for an ungodly amount of time. I guess that I will never get sick of Alice In Chains. Song wise, every single track is great - my favorite being &quot;Man in the Box&quot; (also one of my favorite songs of all time). Listen, if you want a break from your everyday musical choises (mine being metal) and want something simple and great listen to this. Alice in Chains can do no wrong.
1878424319|5.0|I met this book at a time when my life was at a cross-roads.  My marriage was falling apart while my career was soaring.  I realized that there was a huge disconnect between my apparent happiness at work and the malnourished soul within.  I read this book in a period of 2-3 days, underlined key phrases, and went back to it during times of self-doubt, like many put their faith in religious texts. <BR>The first aggreement, Be impeccable with your word, is the most powerful one of them all.  It has changed the way I conduct internal dialogue with myself and my relationships with friends, family, and even strangers.  I have abandoned gossiping about others and taking pleasure in hearing scandolous stories.  Now, I am more honest with myself and the world I live in.  I am happy and fulfilled and this little book continues to inspire and guide me. A MUST READ! The only pre-requisite is that you have to be willing to change.
B00005YXZH|3.0|Alright, all lyrical, complex rock pretty much begins and ends with Bobby D. That's Dylan to the uninformed. So, we end up these days with Tweedy, Ryan Adams (Gold has 6 or 7 songs that reek with talent!), and some other \\"heir-apprarents.\\" (Pete Yorn's album, for example - very cool).True, somewhat of an unfair comparison, but I see alt-country, for lack of a better description, and it's genre, as possessing a truly American, intelligent take on rock music. So that's my bias, right up front. <br />So, I buy this highly-touted cd. It's always fun to see who the critics \\"darlings\\" are at any given moment. They are, historically, a graveyard of forgotten artists. So, Wilco puts out an arty album. Radiohead has obviously influenced the intelligent bands of this era. Tweedy remains a midwestern, soulful voice, spouting Stipe-like, obscure lyrics that are at times poetic, at times oblique and oddly simplistic. But where they score big points is originality. Wilco is following an original vision, whether you connect or not. And in this day and age, that is HUGE. Sing-song rythyms ...catchy yet obscure stuff, but it will stick in your head. If you like a little edgier, rebellious, cocky sound, try Ryan Adams, or even Jesse Malin. But Wiclo is slick, yet earthy, and pretty cool. But my rockin' friends call it sissy music, but they've got Van Halen and AC/DC hangups from the 70s. This cd is thoughtful, smart and pretty tight, but it's not going to grab you by the throat, unless you're the extremely thoughtful, sensitive music type. It's Subtle - I keep thinking of REM classics (one of my favorite bands). It's a groove you either get or don't. But -there is no doubt, Tweedy is a sincere, authentic talent. And kudos for these guys shopping this record when their label blew them off. Dumb-a&& record execs! If it had had more of a barroom edge, lie their earlier stuff edge, maybe 4.5 stars. Worthwhile, but you really have to listen to get it.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|Gepetto, a kindly old woodcarver, creates a little puppet boy of pine and names him Pinocchio.  Because the old man, who has been generous and good all his life, loves children - but has none of his own - the Blue Fairy brings the marionette to life in order to be a son to him.  She tells Pinocchio that in order to be a real boy, he must exhibit the virtues of truth, courage &amp; selflessness...A timeless excursion into the world of classic childhood fantasy, this 194O Disney picture will no doubt be treasured in 2O4O: its theme is too timeless to date badly. The film cost the Disney studio 2.5 million dollars to produce &amp; out of the total 2 million (!) drawings, a mere 3OO,OOO were ultimately used in the finished film. Dickie Jones, who was a child actor who infrequently appeared in OUR GANG comedies, lent his voice for the title character, while Evelyn Venable provided the Blue Fairy with vocal chords.  Frankie Darro vocalised Lampwick &amp; Cliff Edwards, as Jiminy Cricket, sang the AA winning song WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR.  The original story was adapted from the 1882 novel by Carlo Collodi &quot;La Avventure d'Pinocchio&quot;.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This album has been my favorite of all of PJs offerings since about 1 year after owning it... I bought it just a week after it came out. Pieces of it I've always loved, but the album as a whole has grown on me moreso than any of the others, though I love them all (the new one included - Riot Act)....<br />This is the one I pull out most often, and like many reviewers here I've never understood why more folks don't feel similarly. Looking at the average rating of this album here on Amazon though, maybe I've only been hearing whining.<br />What I do know is that huge number of more casual PJ fans don't even KNOW of this album - it came in under the radar more than any other.<br />Well, scope it out kids!<br />This one never misses. Not a track!<br />Cheers,<br />KPR

John Ipe, great-grandfather of main characters Rahel and Estha, was renowned for the blessing bestowed on him by the Patriarch of Antioch when he was just seven years old. \\"Long after he grew up and became a priest, Reverend Ipe continued to be known as Punnyan Kunju-Little Blessed One-and people came...with children to be blessed by him.\\"<BR>Then there was Pappachi, Shri Benaan John Ipe. He was known in the community for his integrity and poise, but in his home he was the thrower of brass vases, and his wife, Mammachi's continual abuser. With his death he left a stale bruised house of memories. Ammu and brother Chacko were left in the wake of his fury, and they led to even more regression of the family honor. <BR>Ammu was once a dream-driven youth, but all that changed when she married her husband. \\"He proposed to Ammu five days after they first met. Ammu didn't pretend to be in love with him. She just weighed the odds and accepted. She thought that anything, anyone at all, would be better than returning to Ayemenem.\\" Soon after Ammu became pregnant and gave birth to Rahel and Estha wide-eyed \\"two-egg twins.\\" Her increasingly alcoholic husband started beating her and \\"when his bouts of children began to include the children... Ammu left her husband and returned, unwelcomed, to her parents in Ayemenem.\\" In the Syrian Christian heritage, this made the children practically illegitimate.Ammu continues tarnishing the family's reputation by having an affair with the family carpenter, Velutha, an \\"Untouchable Paravan,\\" very low in the social structure of Indian society.<BR>The main story stems from the visit of Sophie Mol, Chacko Ipe's daughter, and Margaret Kochamma, his recently widowed ex-wife from their home in London. Sophie Mol becomes an instant idol to her younger cousins, \\"loved from the beginning.\\" She's woven into their crazy games, and often trials along with their adventures. However, Sophie Mol never makes it back to her home in London, for she is tragically drowned in one of the twins' excursions across the river to visit Velutha. It was a dark night, and the boat simply tipped over, \\"she was gone. Carried away on the muffled highway.\\"<BR>After her death, the twins stay in their hideout contemplating spending the rest of their life in jail. They become witnesses to Velutha being fatally beaten by policemen under the premise that he has kidnapped the children. <br />These tragedies are followed by the defeat of the family's \\"Paradise Pickles and Preserves\\" pickling company to communist revolutionaries. All this is done in a simple yet horrible conversation between Chacko Ipe and Comrade K.N.M. Pillai \\"`Of course the proper forum to air workers' grievances is through the Union... it's a shameful matter for them not to be unionized and join the Party Struggle,' `I've though of that,' Chacko said. ` I am going to formally organize them into a union. They will elect their own representatives.' `But comrade, you cannot stage their revolution for them. You can only create awareness. Educate them. They must launch their own struggle. They must overcome their fears.'\\" Then Pillai \\"deftly banished Chacko from the fighting ranks of the Overthrowers to the treacherous ranks of the To Be Overthrown.\\" In this one act Comrade Pillai destroyed Paradise Pickles forever, and it became just another building empty of a future.<BR>The real strength and beauty of this plot comes from the description of each character's past and present. Through shadow-like vignettes the reader is brought into the Ayemenem house, and into the life of each family member. This timeless transcendence makes every character seem alive. And although the poetic language of the story makes it very beautiful, it is a weakness to the plot. With such rich Indian dialect the reader is at times confused with the meaning of the text and some experiences are lost in the translation.<BR> This novel could also be seen as a window into the world of the Indian Communism Revolution. The children of Ayemenem start questioning the politics of the revolution when they see that their own friend, Velutha is part of a Communist demonstration. The wave of Marxist idealism leeches onto the Indian lower-class, bringing mass uprising and the formation of worker's unions. This very rebellion tears at the family's pickling factory, and eventually leads to its demise due to the impossibility of the establishment workers union.<BR> This novel renewed the definition of beauty. It speaks continuously of the greasy, fading society that the characters live in, yet the language with which it is presented speaks so that the reader can't help but love the calluses of Chacko's elbows or the wrinkles on Baby Kochamma's age-worn face. The poetic little nursery rhymes and nonsense language of the seven-year-old narrator add a spice to the informal structure of the plot. Arundhati has a way of transforming the reader into their seven-year old self, then to an enlightened, jaded youth, then to a passionately corrupt adult; all through the realness of the experiences of the Ayemenem house.

B00004SPYJ|5.0|I viewed this movie in my Freshman English Class after reading the play. I was a bit disappointed that my teacher chose this version...because all of my friends were watching the Leo DiCaprio version in their classes. I soon realized, however, that this movie was a much better choice. It stays true to Shakespeare, retaining most of his lines. It also takes place during the Renaissance in Italy. The Leo DiCaprio version is not very traditional, and is not an accurate portrayal of R+J. I loved this movie because the scenery and costumes were beautiful, and the actors and actresses delivered wonderful performances. I really enjoyed the fact that Romeo and Juliet were played by young actors, because it made it more realistic. I still want to see the DiCaprio one (and I am upset that I can't find it in Blockbuster), but this movie more accuratly portrays what Romeo and Juliet should be. I am thinking about buying this version, I like it so much.
0151006903|5.0|Umberto Eco's novels are so full of ideas that after finishing each of his three greatest ones--THE NAME OF THE ROSE, FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM, and now BAUDOLINO--I immediately read it again. THE NAME OF THE ROSE drew me because my own Medieval studies have focused on fourteenth century heresy and social justice movements, because I too love Sherlock Holmes and &quot;got&quot; the humorous references, and because Eco's heart and soul are so clearly liberal and humanist, my own chosen path through life.<br />The dazzling FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM, which I consider his greatest novelistic achievement, is the most penetrating study in fictional form of our sad and comical human propensity of drawing conclusions out of nothing more than our imagination--a view of history as the product of multiple con-games. Eco's latest, BAUDOLINO, follows in the path of FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM and is the wittiest of the three, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  It has the ambience of a science fiction novel about &quot;wonders to be visited out there.&quot; Even so, its historical setting is real enough, the time of the Fourth Crusade and the destruction of Christian Constantinople, but like FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM, its primary theme is not history but the enormous power of the imagination to make history.<br />Although in third person, Baudolino, the greatest con-artist of all, is telling his story to another, much as Marco Polo did.  That's where his picaresque imagination takes off, and ours with him.  We travel from wartorn rural Italy to scholastic Paris, then on to Constantinople and a Central Asia of the imagination.  We meet the Old Man of the Mountain and his hashish-eating Assassins, and nearly all the strange human-monsters of Pliny and Mandeville, who in this novel have personalities and motivations that are quite human--but never the sought-after Prester John.  The conclusion is seamless with the story, and entirely satisfying. To present his hero's travels (and we are free to conclude that Baudolino never truly traveled anywhere beyond Constantinople except in his head), Eco weaves together the related Medieval accounts of Prester John, Sindbad the Sailor and Sir John de Mandeville, and to some extent stirs in Marco Polo. It's a wonderful conceit to make Baudolino and his friends the authors of Prester John's Letter--although in a fascinatingly roundabout way.<br />The Prester John, Sindbad and Mandeville legends clearly owe their wonders to Pliny the Elder's gullible reports of the Mysterious East.  Marco's travelogue is soberer, but many historians doubt that he ever went to China, and attribute the book to his father's and uncle's stories plus self-aggrandizing imagination.  Yes, we always come back to imagination!<br />BAUDOLINO is a troubling, joyous book, which is no contradiction.  It discloses every human weakness, but also every kind of courage and persistence.  It will cheer you and give you hope that dreams and imagination might just change history.
6305171769|3.0|This movie was not that bad. I liked. It ignored Part 6 and Part 7,but those parts [were bad] anyway. If you sit back and watch you will probably enjoy it. Jamie Lee Curtis is drunk and that is pretty funny. Micahel Myers escapes but what else is new.DO NOT watch Halloween: Resserection it just makes no sense. This was a good solid movie.
B000059TFO|4.0|I have read reviews of Mississippi Burning that range from waxing poetic about its power to those that despise its use of disturbing images to elicite an \\"autonomic response\\" of disgust and anger from the audience.  Having viewed the movie several times, I realize that the latter's claims are not entirely without merit.  That being said, Mississippi Burning is one of my favorite movies.  <br />I don't know much about the situation in the South before the present day.  For that matter, I don't know much about it now.  I have no idea if things were as bad as they were portrayed in the movie.  Having seen pictures of lynchings, though, as well as the festival-like atmosphere that accompanied them, I can't imagine that the film was too far off base.  The atmosphere of fear and hate that pervades the film is almost visible.  It's hard to imagine anyone being able to survive it with their humanity intact.  <br />Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as the two FBI agents are an interesting study in contrasts.  Hackman, as a former Good Ol' Boy sheriff, sees stublety and patience as the necessary tools to solve the three civil rights workers' disappearances.  Dafoe, as a Kennedy recruit from the Justice Department, sees an intense show of federal strength and sheer investigative force as the way to go.  Dafoe is an idealist, Hackman is a realist.  The one thing they have in common is a disgust for the way blacks are treated in the South.  I must admit I found Hackman's performance more convincing than Dafoe's, perhaps because his was a more complex character.  A product of two worlds, one of racism and one of unity, his must not have been an easy life.  And of course, Frances McDormand is brilliant as the long-suffering wife of a Klan member/Sheriff's deputy.  She is disgusted with what's going on with blacks in her town, but cannot do anything about it.  Her sense of fear and entrapment in a prison of hate have a claustrophobic feel to them that is palpable.<br />I do wish the movie hadn't used quite so many stereotypes in its potrayals of secondary characters, particularly blacks.  I don't think there was a single scene in the movie that didn't show blacks as being the victims of some hate crime or other.  It got so bad I couldn't see a black face without getting nervous for his or her continued good health.  Surely *someone* in the black community decided to say \\"enough is enough\\"?  <br />Also, the idea that everyone in Mississippi was (a) in the KKK, (b) black, or (c) a passive, approving bystander is an injustice to human nature.  Situations are always more complex than they seem, and this one was no different, I'm sure.  Oh well, it's not entirely the director's fault.  He only had two hours.  <br />This movie understands racism, is able to dig into the wellspring of hatred and sniveling and air it to the world.  I've never been able to completely comprehend racism on anything other than an intellectual level.  That it existed, I never had any doubt, but it's one thing to know it, but it's something else to really *know* it.  And once you do know it, it's like staring in a funhouse mirror.  You can see the image, but you're unable to force the shape you see into the shape you *think* should be there.  This movie provides you with that gut abilty.
0800196473|4.0|After reading the excellent book I just had to go out and get the movie.  I would say that except for a collapse at the end, this film does capture the essence and spirit of the movie.  And that's not an easy thing to do.  Carl Hiaasen's novel about the topless business in Florida walked a very fine line.  On one hand, just about everyone but Erin, played very well by Demi Moore, was portrayed as a loser to some degree under the biting pen of the author.  Yet he told a story that made these characters seems realistic.  <br />The movie does  a much better job than I thought could be done with the subtle attitude of the story.  A lot of the reviews I've seen show that the reviewers who saw it just don't get it.  Yes, most of the characters are dumb and or evil, but they are done so in a sly, elegant manner.  Just about every character in the movie nails the book, except Stuart Pankin's dull portrayal of the sleazy lawyer.  <br />There are two factors that keep it from five-star territory.  First, Hollywood does wimp out on the ending.  One of the fine things Hiassen does while keeping his characters funny is also to make some of them realistically dangerous.  These are nasty people, and while there is death in the movie, there was a lot more in the book.  Were they thinking of making a sequel?<br />The other factor, and I have to be a stickler about it, is that the book portrayed a nude club, and there's just not enough shots of the ladies the way I'd like to see them.  Some plot is just too important to leave out.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|My first introduction to T.A.T.U. was when they played &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; during the last episode of &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;.  From that moment, I knew that they had to be great.  This is just a wonderful CD.  As for the enhanced CD part, it includes the video for &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and a behind the scenes thing on that video.  Each of the songs is great and they all have extremely well thought out lyrics.  The best song on here is probably &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;, followed very closely by &quot;30 Minutes&quot;.  The CD as a whole seems to have the theme of two girls trying to decide whether or not to tell their parents that they're lesbians.  Even the two tracks in Russian are good.  I like &quot;Nas Ne Dogonyat&quot; better than &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;, quite honestly.  Also, one fo the songs on here is &quot;How Soon is Now&quot;, a song many people would recognize as the &quot;Charmed&quot; theme song, but both this version and the &quot;Charmed&quot; version of the song are covers of a song by The Smiths.  All in all, this CD is simply wonderful.  I cannot stress that enough.
B00003CY0U|3.0|This movie goes through great pains to make us believe that there are super-secret organizations, sanctioned by the government, to keep our way of life intact.  They have absolute power, unlimited resources, and if innocents get in the way, well, it's the greater good that has to be taken into consideration. <br />Well, something like this probably does exist to some degree, but losing any sleep over it is not going to change a thing.  And as silly as this movie can sometimes make it, such as having the resources to literally lift a bus out of traffic with a helicopter shouldn't bring out too much of a cynical streak in us.  For in the case of this movie, the execution of a taut thriller is what matters.<br />The movie works because John Travolta carries it.  Whatever you think of his career, the man's a born movie star.  He convincingly portrays a man who will kill civilians to get his point across.  And he will so convincingly give his justification that you might actually buy it.  <br />The plot centers around a convicted computer hacker, played by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman.  He is not allowed to touch a computer as part of his parole, and is also banned from seeing his daughter.  Enter Mr. Travolta, who makes him an offer he can't refuse.  He does this with a combination of fear and incentive.  The fear is on his life, and the incentive is via money and Halle Berry.  <br />The movie works because it keeps you guessing who are the good guys, and who are the bad guys.  Jackman has to not only use his hacking skills, but wits and physical ability to overcome obstacle after obstacle.  This include Ms. Berry, in one of the finest nude scenes of a major star you will ever see in a movie.  If Jackman needed a final push to get his cooperation, well, it would probably work for me, too.  <br />But all through it swaggers Travolta, who is unbending through the whole movie in his utter confidence.  While you one cannot condone his methods, one can probably concede there may be a use for him in our world.  Ms. Berry, I mean the movie, is definitely worth seeing.
B0000640VO|5.0|This film was my first time ever watching a foreign film, and I was surely impressed.  I've already watched it countless times, and it has yet to grow old.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet certainly has a talent for story-telling, as evidenced by this film.  Audrey Tautou is absolutely wonderful in her portrayal of Amelie Poulain, a lonely girl who has decided to become a do-gooder.  As she continues her work, she will find that what goes around really does come around, and that if you stop looking for love, it will find you.
B00005JKNB|4.0|This is a well-done, well-intentioned feel-good movie that I wouldn't mind seeing more of.  It shows that basic human decency can prevail, as long as not done in a hokey way by<BR>Hollywood.  While not in Forrest Gump territory in it's imagination, it's B-team Gump just waiting for it's shot in the big leagues.<br />Jim Carrey shows his incredible versatility once again by playing possibly his most likeable  character.  Only the character doesn't start out so likeable.  He plays a very shallow movie writer in the 1940's who isn't a Communist, but is willing to smear other people's lives in order to play Hollywood's game in those days and keep his job. <br /> That is, before he gets in one of those neat Hollywood plots where he gets amnesia, and wakes up in a town that thinks he's someone else.  Since just about everyone in the town says he's such a swell guy, well, he figures he must be, so he becomes one.  He single-handedly revives a town decimated by losing a lot of it's citizens in World War II.  He brings joy to the man who thinks his son has returned.  And he even gets a shot at the original guy's girl.  <br />All of this would make it standard if it weren't for the final act of this fairly long, but very interesting movie.  Inevitably, his memory starts coming back,  coincidently at the same time the government and Hollywood track him down to return to play the Commie game.  Will he play the game and get a cushy job for life, or will he stand up for truth, justice, and the Real American way, go back to the town, and get the girl?  I bet you can get it right with one guess, but that's OK.  It's that kind of movie.
B00000K2UX|5.0|The music: Out of the thousands of soundtracks produced, Top Gun is the one many people pick as their favorite. Full of the signature sound of the eighties, this album contains such smash hits as Take My Breath Away, Danger Zone, and Heaven In Your Eyes. In fact, not one of the songs on this disc fails to live up to its potential, from the seductive Lead Me On to the rocky Playing With The Boys to the haunting Destination Unknown. The Top Gun Anthem, a stirring instrumental, is one of my personal favorites. Also included on this album are Jerry Lee Lewis's Great Balls Off Fire, Otis Redding's The Dock Of The Bay, the Righteous Brothers's You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling, and a dance remix of Playing With The Boys.<br />The booklet: A long unfolding affair with all the lyrics printed clearly, even if some in Hot Summer Nights are incorrect (I'm not quite sure what happened there!). It also contains \\"A Musical Conversation With Jerry Bruckheimer,\\" an interview with the movie's producer in which he answers questions about the secret to his success, the ease of putting together a multi-artist pop soundtrack back in the eighties, being Tom Cruise's springboard, and more. On the other side of the unfolded strip are nine color photographs of the lead actors in Top Gun.<br />In summary: A brilliant and poignant and thoroughly American classic. Sure to complement any collection.
6301966988|4.0|I just saw the Righteous Brothers in concert, where, for me, the highlight of course was \\"Unchained Melody\\".  Bobby Hatfield, at \\"fifty twelve\\", as he puts it, can still belt out the song, and he takes obvious joy in doing it.  If you can catch their act, it's worth it.<br />Of course such an occasion means pulling out our copy of \\"Ghost\\" and giving that another watch.  I am going to go out on a limb by saying that as much of a financial success this movie was, it would not have been that big without the immortal scene of Demi Moore and Patrick Swazye attempting to make a marital aid out of a lump of clay.  <br />When Hollywood does a terrific job of creating entertainment for entertainment's sake, there's nothing wrong with that.  While it may be true that much of the plot may have been put together by a marketing team as much as a writer, in this case, it's ok, because they hit the right buttons enough.  <br />We've already talked about the \\"Unchained Melody\\" number.  But there is the marvelous comedic presence, anchored by Whoopi Goldberg, who earned her Oscar.  And at the other end of the spectrum, there is enough tear-jerking to get though a box of tissues.  <br />Not that it's perfect.  Demi Moore takes too long to be convinced of the genuineness of the \\"Ghost\\", despite being repeatedly given things only she and Swayze could have known.  And while they have a right to portray an afterlife of their choosing, sometimes it seems the rules are there to support the plot, and were probably changed as filming occurred.  But if you want a movie to snuggle up with your significant other, you can't go wrong with this one.

B00003CXC6|5.0|Criterion deserves praise for it's presentation of Kurosawa's \\"Rashomon.\\" Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography is incredible in it's use of camera movement, light, shadows, rain and wind effects. I enjoyed the bonus excerpts from Miyagawa's documentary. I was intrigued by the film's approach of story telling from 4 difference sources i.e. the Woodcuter (Takashi Shimura), the Bandit (Toshiro Mifune), the raped Wife (Machiko Kyo), and the dead Husband (Masayuki Mori) told thru a Medium. The viewer must play detective to piece together the \\"truth\\" of what has taken place. We learn from \\"Rashomon\\" is that we all have our own personal vision of \\"reality.\\" In this study of human nature, the characters see what they want to believe. Donald Richie's expert commentary was essential in understaning the film's structure. Richie discusses the films use of visual triangles in portraying the three main characters (Mifune, Kyo, & Mori). It's a must-see film for anyone that appreciates great art.
B00005JKGI|5.0|The ultimate michael cain/mini movie.this is the only movie which is played every year in the UK that nobody complains about being repeated all the time.a classic,just like the cooper s itself.<BR> Unfortunatly I am now in  Canada and am unable to get a copy.If only the DVDs from the UK would work here,I have told so many people about it,they want to see it.
B00005JL78|5.0|There are very few movies out there that can make you smile. I'm not just talking about happy go lucky movies, but movies that rivet you with something magical that no other movie contains. The Star Wars trilogy did this, The Matrix did this...Minority Report does this.<br />John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a police officer that works for a futuristic unit called Precrime. This division uses three individuals called the Precogs that can see the future to stop murders before they happen. Cruise firmly believes in the ability of the Precogs, as well as their accuracy, yet is fed a taste of his own medicine when the Precogs predict a murder that he, himself, will commit. As a morality tale and as far as the message behind the whole movie was concerned, I was unimpressed, but this was taken away from the sheer magic of the movie's visual effects and the rich individual stories of the characters. <br />Every element of this movie is spectacular. There are fine performances from Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell, the special effects are some of the best since The Matrix, the story is spectacular and it holds your attention for the duration. You feel caught up in the story, a part of it, which is why you can't turn away, wanting to see what will happen next. <br />I predict you are running out the door right now to buy this...make me right.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|When I first heard about T.A.T.U, who are these two Russian teenage girls who are apparently lesbian, I thought this would be just another gimmicky pop thing whose music would be on the level of the CHEEKY GIRLS (&quot;Touch My Bum&quot;). So I was really surprised when I heard the two singles &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; and &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;. This music is more like PRODIGY-lite than the CHEEKY GIRLS. In a way, you could compare T.A.T.U.'s debut to BRITNEY SPEARS, although BRITNEY's music and her videos were a lot 'happier' than this duo's. Anyway, all the songs in this album are great for club-play and are really well-produced, but somehow I felt there was a mis-match between the music and the band's image. It's not quite as 'fun' as you'd expect a teenage lesbian pop act to be. My advice to these girls would be to either lighten up a little and make their music (and videos) a little more 'fun' to go with their 'teen-lesbian' image, or to simply get rid of the whole lesbian facade and become a hardcore club-play band.
B00005JL78|3.0|Tom Cruise is a futuristic detective (literally - he solves crimes that haven't occurred yet) in \\"Minority Report\\".  It's 2054, and Cruise is Anderton, an emotionally scarred (and substance abusing) detective assigned to an elite detail called \\"Pre-Crime\\".  Using human oracles called \\"Pre-cogs\\", Anderton receives visual clues to murders that haven't occurred yet - clues of the crime come in disconnected, dreamlike scenes.  The \\"pre-cogs\\"- two men and a woman, each ironically named for a famous mystery author - are accidents of nature and the addictions of their mothers.  (Their power is something of a curse: the pre-cogs' life boils down to floating in some sensory deprivation tank while involuntarily channeling repeated episodes of grisly murders).  The pre-cogs are themselves victims of a sort and, being the crucial elements of Pre-Crime, can't expect help from the cops.  It's not clear how the pre-cogs work, but the fact that there are only three of them - and the female \\"Agatha\\" is linchpin - implies that Pre-Crime is on shaky ground (aside from the dubious morality of arresting and imprisoning people for crimes they haven't actually committed). Pre-Crime effectively deters premeditated murder (which can be detected up to 4 days ahead of time), leaving Anderton and his crew with crimes of passion which, being spontaneous, are only detected hours (at best) ahead of the fact.  \\"Pre-Criminals\\" are given \\"Halos\\" - headsets that put them to sleep until they can be placed in a more permanent form of suspended animation (due process, like law enforcement, works ahead of the crime, so that \\"punishment\\" is immediate).  <br />Anderton is already in trouble when the story starts - though professionally respected, he's scarred by his son's disappearance years before, an event that wrecked his marriage and turned him into a career hog who jogs through the worst parts of old D.C. and buys his illegal drugs from the homeless and hopeless that stubbornly inhabit the future.  Nevertheless, the Pre-Cogs keep Anderton too preoccupied to dwell on his horrible past.  When Agatha mysteriously beams visions of a long past (and \\"Pre-Solved\\" crime) Anderton unwisely digs deeper.  Before he can dig deep enough, the Pre-Cogs get another vision - one of a man nobody has ever heard of losing his life to man nobody in Pre-Crime can forget: Anderton himself.  Now Anderton must run, knowing full well that nobody - once tagged by Pre-Crime - can ever run far or fast enough.  Instead, he tries to stay out long enough to learn how Pre-Cogs work.  Tracking down their mysterious \\"engineer\\", Anderton will learn a shocking truth: Pre-Cogs, while never wrong, will, on occasion, disagree.  Because this happens so rarely (tell that to the poor sap who gets haloed anyway) instances of \\"pre-cog cognitive dissonance\\" (okay, I made that up) are called \\"Minority Reports\\".   Convinced he was set up and that a minority report exists that will clear him, Anderton uses every trick he knows to elude capture and also sneak back into Pre-Crime, the only place he can conceivably find his own minority report.<br />Though visually cool and perfectly starpowered (I don't hate Tom Cruise movies), you can't get past \\"Minority Report\\"'s biggest flaw - it's a thriller that doesn't thrill.  The film tries to work like a mystery (the Pre-Cogs don't solve the crimes, only present cryptic clues to those that haven't occurred - old fashioned detective work is still crucial) but frustrates itself.  Nevertheless, the script is stubbornly un-thrilling - piecing together clues before it gives itself a chance to appreciate what the clues are.  Rather than give our hero the tools to solve the crime, the film just tosses the clues together.  The mystery is thus solved less by the intelligence of its characters than its compulsion to fill in its own gaps.  By the time Anderton has confronted his purported victim-to-be, you're more likely to have \\"pre-cogged\\" the twist ending yourself.  What's left is too reminiscent of \\"No Way Out\\" (man who can implicate those in power is himself implicated in a crime) and, even more unfortunately, the first \\"Mission Impossible\\" (Cruise must sneak back to his own headquarters) suffering by comparison to each.  Showing that there's still some Kurbick left over after \\"A.I.\\" Spielberg liberally sprinkles his story with all sorts of weirdoes meant to herald the end of human civilization: to elude the cops, Anderton has his eyes replaced by a seedy underworld doctor played by Peter Stormare (Hollywood's hardest working character actor); Pre-Crime prisoners are kept in upright coffins and stored in a cross between a prison and a morgue, presided over by a certifiable weirdo who plays a church organ and refers to his inmates as \\"his flock\\"; the Pre-Cogs' caretaker evinces an apparently unprofessional interest in Agatha; the Pre-Cogs themselves are the result of their parents' drug addiction.  But these characters do less to advance or detail the plot than merely confirm a dark opinion of humanity (like the guys who ran the \\"Flesh Fair\\" in \\"A.I.\\" or the lawyer who gets chomped in \\"Jurassic\\" - they exist only to remind us how much humanity has it coming to them).  If \\"Minority\\" doesn't excel as a thriller or sci-fi epic, it's nevertheless immensely satisfying as both.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Kansas is one of the forerunners of American progressive hard rock movement while showing their brilliant pop rock sense as often found in mid western bands. The first half of this compilation shows pop side of the band such as pop hard rock hit gCarry On Wayward Son&quot;, excellent moody ballad &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; and melodic rock hit gFight Fire With Fire&quot;. But as this compilation moves on you will be a bit by bit enchanted by baroque flavored &quot;No One Together&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot; and well-crafted<br />tracks, which are main part of their appeal, follow until &quot;Closet Chronicles&quot; recorded live originally &quot;Point Of Know Return&quot; track. It is by no means the best collection because you are missing great tracks such as &quot;Nobody Home&quot; and a number of &quot;Leftoverture&quot; tracks. If you want more of Kansas, get &quot;Leftoverture&quot; and &quot;Point Of Know Return&quot; which is almost equal to this compilation. After the original release of this compilation in 1984, they put out more and more greet albums get it if you are interested.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I find it hard to understand how this film has managed to score so high by many standards with out being available as a DVD in Europe. Now it is being issued as an DVD special box edition in the US and Canada only.<br />For years, I have been trying to get it here in the UK and nowhere in Europe seems to be in a DVD format. <br />Fine, I have it in VHS but the art of this film is worth preserving with the finest technology available.<br />I cannot accept the argument that there is not a market large enough in Europe to issue this film in a DVD format. <br />I would like to bring this to the attention of the high executives of Amazon. I hope I can get some guidance to acquire such a piece of Beaux Arts to share it with my family.<br />Kind regards,<br />Enrique,<BR>Manchester, England
B00006SFBD|3.0|Opeth is a band full of geniuses. There is no disputing that.....however, with this release I found it very difficult to enjoy. I loved most of their albums, but this one had a problem that really irritated me. Each song is very long (which is okay) but half of the song will be really cool, while the second half is boring, plodding, and tedious to sit through.<br />I saw pick up pretty much ANY other Opeth album but this one. Blackwater Park is a good starter, and build from there. This should only be picked up by the hardcore fan of Opeth.<br />Sadly, I considered myself a hardcore fan......but I just can't get into this.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album has the best of both worlds for Beatles fans because it retains much of the early Beatles' charm and strong band songwriting skills while moving them into their studio period with more experimental ideas being used. Is it just me, or did the Beatles become more pessimistic in their life views as time wore on, until at this album, at least lyrically, they started to fall into a world of imagination and make- believe? There was much wisdom in the lyrics of many of their songs, but later they seemed to just give up completely on reality and try to paint a more trippy picture of things. Anyway this album is what I like to call a doorway from their reality into their more isolated fantasy of their later period, even though I wouldn't miss any of their albums for the ride!
B00005ARDC|5.0|This is my favorite CD.  I have been hungry for some good old American rock-n-roll and this band satisfies my cravings.  While it falls into the category of &quot;garage rock&quot;, it has a much more complex and full sound than punkish bands like the Hives or the Vines.  Like a good live album, this CD has a vibe to it that draws the listener in.
B000002UAU|5.0|Whether you have quibbles with the many-colored offerings the Beatles put on this trippy album, you have to admit that it signaled a permanent change in the way rock album music was perceived. Before Sgt. Peppers, the Beatles dealt largely with down-to-earth subject matter. This album brought in full force their creativity, to a completely different level, lyrically through much more imaginative poetic visualings, musically through extending the possibilities of music by use of the studio as another instrument, and visually by raising the bar for an album cover that was colorful and artistic yet more functional than past rock albums with the introduction of a complete lyric sheet. The fact that it is a Beatles album guarrantees it should be awarded 5 stars, because if you haven't heard it you don't know why music is the way it is today. What a boring world of music we'd have without the Beatles!

B00007L4MJ|5.0|There are many things that make this version great, but I will mention only 3.<br />1. The film is painstakingly restored to (probably) the cleanest graphics since 1927 in Berlin (if even then). Gone is the graininess, dirt, smudges, water spots, and scenes that are too light, or too dark. According to the restoration documentary, many of the scenes were restored frame by frame. WOW. What a labor of love. Keep in mind that 1/4 of the film is gone forever, so...<br />2. The original script is used. This film has probably been the most butchered, massacred, botched, and misrepresented script ever. The 45 minute documentary that comes with the DVD explains why. What Keno did is use the original script, scenes that were gone forever were told via a storyboard (which makes this version probably the most coherant Metropolis ever). Example: If you watch the cheap PD production of Metropolis, it makes Rotwang look like a faithful servant of Joh Fredersen, whereas the Kino version not only shows that Rotwang dispises Fredersen, but why (It seems that they shared the same woman, named Hel (another fact not mentioned in all other versions). She was originally Rotwang's girl, but was lured away by Fredersen. She dies giving birth to Freder). There are many other small scenes that make the film look like a different, better & more complete movie.<br />3. It has the original 1927 Orchestral Score. All the other versions of this film have background music (lets see... The Media version is the same music over and over again. The Platnum version is mood music from standard classical music which abruptly changes when the scene changes. The Georgio Moroder one (which would probably be the lowest rated for tackiness alone) plays Dat Ol' Time Rock 'n' Roll). It is so refreshing not only to hear the original score (of course, newly recorded), but to be able to hear it in dolby 5.1 surround.<br />The only thing left to ask yourself is this. What do I do with my old cheap version? The only answer I can come up with is that fortunately, the cheap disk is still round and therefore has the perfect shape for skeet shooting.<br />If you've never purchased Metropolis, this is the one to get. This one may cost more, but is proof (just like many Criterion releases) that you get what you pay for.<br />Kudos to Kino, and Transit Films.answer I can come up with is that fortunately, the cheap disk is still round and therefore has the perfect shape for skeet shooting.<br />If you've never purchased Metropolis, this is the one to get.

0140186409|5.0|Before I read this book, I was told that it is a slow and boring read due to not having much action.  Well, the action part may be true (depends on what you consider to be &quot;action&quot;), but the boring part is definitely not the case.  I literally couldn't put this book down.  In a nutshell, it tells the story of a depression era family that is driven from their family farm and describes the hopefullnes and heartache that entails their journey across the country to California in search for work.  I realized the degree of struggle of which we today do not, and could not, understand, yet it was so real to those living just a couple of generations earlier.  If you stick with this book and give it a chance it will definitely prove to make you think.  If you're pondering whether or not to buy it...I say what are you waiting for?
071198042X|2.0|I am searching high and low, for a book that wasn't as badly written as this one. I have been a fan of Queen and Freddie for over ten years and from time to time I get into my collecting bug. For example, tapes, cd's obviously, very rarely would I be able to find a book! Back in the day when the internet wasn't as fast, as commonly used, or for that matter things were as easy to find..I would be on it constantly looking for bits and pieces of information about my favorite, although somewhat defunct Queen.  Now, with this plethora of information I have now, etc., I was still surprised to find this book at my local bookstores, not once but twice! Go figure, not taking any chance at all, I bought it.  I was a little hesitant at first, being that because of all the information I didn't know about Freddie, personally I mean, he didn't give many interviews, etc. would this shatter my naivte about his personal life? Would it effect the way I viewed him? Well, the answer to that my friends is no.  I will tell you why, because this book went into depth about nothing.  From here to there it was a list of Freddie's friends and lovers, nor does it disspell so many rumors at all, they're was maybe a page about that.. until this choppy, &quot;safely written&quot; memoir, basically goes on about the bars, clubs and people they frequented all over the world.  It doesn't go into much about really freddie at all.  It seems that this book is a bit superficial, at the end is probably the most infomation you'll get out of it.. well, perhaps the beginning as well, but as for the middle, i say, read the first twenty, then the last twenty pages you just about have the book summed up.
B000021XS0|5.0|Sometimes when I buy an album after hearing a lot of hyperbolic praise for it, it's somewhat of a letdown at first, victimized by high expectations.  \\"Scenes From a Memory,\\" however, is not one of those albums.  The first time I heard it I was enthralled, and my appreciation has only grown since.<br />This album is flat-out amazing, doubtless the pinnacle of progressive metal.  Telling a murder mystery in two parts, it's a seventy-seven-minute tour de force of unmatched depth, virtuosity, and creativity.  More than any other DT album, \\"SFAM\\" demonstrates their ability to write complex, innovative, and grandiose songs.  On heavy tunes like \\"Strange Deja Vu\\" and \\"Home,\\" John Petrucci's punishing riffs slice through James Labrie's swirling vocals, with Mike Portnoy and John Myung keeping rock-solid rhythms on drums and bass.  Even the ballads \\"Through Her Eyes\\" and \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" are great songs, filled with swelling music and impassioned vocals.  And the closing epic \\"Finally Free\\" ends the album on the best note possible.  If that's not enough, the instrumental passages are among the best I've ever heard, maybe equalled only by Symphony X in the metal world.  The first time I heard the interplay between John's guitars and Jordan Rudess's keyboards on \\"Fatal Tragedy,\\" I wound up lying on the floor of my room, twitching from pleasure overload.  So to sum up, you've got great music, great vocals, and most importantly, great songs.  What more is there to know?  If you haven't heard this album, consider yourself warned: you're missing out on some essential stuff.

Perrysburg gives a thumbs up!
B00005JM1D|5.0|I was expecting a good movie when I went to see \\"Old School,\\" but I wasn't expecting something THIS good.  This movie is, simply put, absolutely hilarious, and it's got lots of brains and heart to go with the goofball humor.  I'm not really into lowbrow comedies, but \\"Old School\\" is a very intelligent take on the typical fratboy fare.  The humor is goofy, but witty at the same time, and there are even some real emotions on display.  The plot revolves around three thirtyish friends who start up a fraternity with some local college students, and it gets a nonstop stream of laughs out of the idea of guys trying to reclaim some of their lost youth.  Will Ferrell is especially great as the loopy Frank, whether he's shooting himself with a tranquilizer dart at his friend's son's birthday party, setting himself on fire trying to jump through a hoop, or belting out an unforgettable rendition of Kansas's \\"Dust in the Wind\\" at the funeral of an elderly pledge.  The underrated Luke Wilson makes a perfect straight man as Mitch, and Vince Vaughn is the picture of intensity as Beanie.  It's really too bad this movie doesn't seem to be getting much attention.  I don't go to the movies much anymore, but this one was more than worth the trip.
B0000640SA|5.0|The idea of creating a story from end to beginning is not new.To create a convincing film that starts with the ending and to make it worth watching is much harder in film than on paper. Christopher Nolan succeeds at this daunting task.<br />Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss do terrific work. Essentially an ugly film on multiple levels Pearce in particular creates a memorable person who has short term memory loss. Excuse the play on words but his performance is essential to pulling off the backward plot convention. Joe Pantoliano's character Teddy is immediately (the word greasy comes to mind) not likeable although we do not find out exactly the nature of his relationship with Leonard until the film unfolds it's twists and turns. Similarly Carrie-Anne Moss's Natalie is cleverly plotted and the general theme of the film is equally well concieved and developed. Memento's themes take a bit of time to develop besides the obvious short term memory loss. I won't discuss the themes as they are best seen and experienced by the viewer.<br />Christopher Nolan's dual screenwriter/director duties serve him well as he allows his cast to work with the material and feed off one another, not a simple thing to do when every scene is essentially new to Leonard also called 'Lenny!'. <br />The city is generic enough and the look of the film is mostly seedy, film noir. The pace is fast and the script tight. You care for Leonard as his life unravels like a backwards train wreck and in the end you are left stunned. <br />Exceptional overall filmmaking and acting.
630522577X|3.0|Having never seen My Fair Lady before, I got to see it for the first time on DVD. Yep, the color looks great, and sound is good, all the trimmings that go with the DVD.<br />But the movie! I know this is supposed to be the classic movie comparable to Sound of Music and Oklahoma, but I did not find it to be a very enjoyable movie. Yes, the songs were good. At times I had no IDEA how the lyric writers could rhyme the words so cleverly. The story plot was certainly a good one. There were a few surprise curse-words that I didn't expect: more than a dozen D-words - most coming in a rapid-fire salvo - and one use of the not-so-nice synonym for horse rear.<br />So what was my beef with the movie? How about IT DIDN'T HAVE AN ENDING? So after Eliza is passed off as the duchess, she finds that that's all she is needed for. Professor Higgins doesn't actually love her, as she supposed. So she leaves. Higgins has a talk with her, and decides he can live without her. And yet her face was \\"like a second nature\\" to him, so he pines after her after she's left. Then she comes back into his house and re-delivers a line she'd said at their first movie. And he says \\"Eliza. Now where in the devil are my slippers?\\" And ta-da! The movie ends! Right there. Did she stay, even after she'd blown up at him because he treated her like luggage? What about Higgins' friend Pickering? He made some sort of mysterious phone call, and departed from the scene, and we NEVER FOUND OUT WHY. In my English, they taught me that a good story has all the elements. Exposition, conflict, rising action, climax, resolution, and ending. This movie don't got no endin'.<br />The movie also winds around a little with rabbit-trails (like Mr. Doolittle's Getting Married in the Morning dance routine, which is totally out of place). It's also awfully long, and I found it hard to keep paying attention.<br />Yes, the songs are great fun. The dancing is okay. But I don't think I'll ever find just cause to watch this movie ever again.
078401213X|4.0|$60,000. That's not most film industry grunt's pay. To make a film on this kind of budget is incredible. To make a good film and create some charater to the look and sound is amazing. I take exception with the main review's sound and film quality scores of 2 out of 5. The quality of the film is grainy and the music is brash along with dark ambient washes of sound. <br />While not breathtaking in terms of technology their effectiveness is central to the film. The other critical remark that really puzzled me regarded how accurate the mathematic models were and thus the film was poor.<br />Let's step back. We aren't watching the story of applied mathematics with a $6 million dollar budget, we are watching a deeply personal work that exploits it's budgetary compromises.<br />The 16mm format is grainy and frequently overlight, we follow a genius who is searching, or perhaps tormented, by the hypothesis that all life can be broken down to a mathematical formula.<br />Sean Gullette's character Max is hounded by a Wall Street parasite and Hassidic Jews, both interested in his work for different reasons. His one friend, an old professor and seeming mentor is his one place where he can unwind but even that gets poisoned as the film progresses and results in tragedy.<br />Max stared into the sun against his mother's advice as a child. After regaining lost sight he experiences headaches which as the film progresses are discussed and happen off camera but build in intensity and are visualized as torment.<br />Nothing is as it seems in this mildly science fiction like film and in the end the resolution is as extreme and personal as the build. <br />Pi is a difficult movie to explain, the film has a lot of interesting shots and visualizations of what Max is going through, much of it representational rather than the typical hollywood film that would smack you over the head with exactly what is happening because you are too stupid to figure it out from the story. Think the last scene of Minority Report which guts an otherwise good film.<br />See Pi for the multilayered performances, philosophies and craft that went into this film. The person that transferred the graphic on the DVD probably made more money than Pi cost to make. That impresses me but it's Darren Aronofsky's at times impressionistic, sometimes surreal approach that combines with good acting to make for a terrific film - at any cost.
B00005JLXC|4.0|I saw this movie twice and its a very cool movie, it was decent and ben affleck did good with daredevil. I thought it was gonna be like spider-man a little bit but it actually turned out to be different from spider-man, it was more hardcore and had its own style, it was also a dark movie too. This is a movie worth seeing right here and everyone will enjoy it and this is the year of marvel since they have X-men 2 and the Hulk coming later this year. I like comic book movies and they're entertaining and next year in 2004, Spider-man 2 will be out and i hope they make a punisher movie now that ill pay to see!.
B00005V9HH|5.0|One of my favorite films of all times, The Usual Suspects is an exeptionally strong ensemble cast work. In particular Gabriel Byrne's cynical and beaten down reformed criminal gone bad role is played so ernestly that you forget you are watching a film. Kevin Spacey's Verbal Gint character is terrific to watch as well. Benicio del Toro steals scenes with his bizzare choice of character in an otherwise nothing role. Even Steven Baldwin turns in a good performance as does Kevin Pollack in a somewhat different role than he usually plays.<br />All the acting is terrific and more importantly, the script is nearly flawless as is the direction. The plot moves along in it's multi-threaded fashion while keeping viewers entertained and involved enough to pay attention.<br />The ending will either annoy or delight you depending on how you view films. I loved it and on second viewing the forshadowing of events are right in front of you like a good murder mystery although The Usual Suspects is much more than a mystery film or buddy flick or crime caper film while being a little bit of each.<br />It's great to see a film that isn't high budget and relies on acting and a good script to move the film along. Although embraced by hollywood this is as independent as you will find in it's easy tone and believable characters.<br />There is simply nothing worth complaining about. Get this DVD, it's additonal content is a lot of fun to watch and helps understanding The Usuual Suspects as more than a film but a project and labor of love that works on all fronts.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Poses&quot; is hands down one of the best records I have come across in a very long time .  If you enjoy big theatractial music then this is a must have in your collection. Rufus Wainwright has painted an amazing, beautiful picture that takes my breath away each and everytime I listen to this record.  I get so caught up in the twists and turns of each song that I lose track of time and place.  Such a work of art makes me wonder how one person can be so creative, how someone can create something so hauntingly beautiful. Such great driving music.   If you have a long drive ahead of you this is one record you must have with you for the long haul.
B000000W3G|5.0|Quite simply, this is a CD that any Smashing Pumpkins fan should have gotten right away without prompting.  My review, therfore, is directed more toward the casual listener or those not familiar with Smashing Pumpkins.  This set represents the music of an era.  It is what alternative is about.<br />The first disc contains your electronic and new age style music.  Mostly in the form of electronic augmented covers of 80's new age songs.<br />The second disc is your mellow strolling alternative rock.  The stuff like mid stone temple pilots and any of those other light and enjoyable tunes.<br />The third disc is where you see your more hard boiled rock (with the exception of pennies which would find a better home on the second disc).  Great songs to be found here, but the last song really is just for the Smashing Pumpkins fans, as it is a 25 minute compendium of stuff off of the cutting room floor.<br />The fourth disc is music to slit your wrists by.  This is the sad, the emotional, the accustic.  Good break up music.  Good music for whenever you want to remind yourself that other people experience sadness too.  This is my personal favorite, each song is fragile and fleeting.<br />The last disc is the more esoteric artsy-fartsy side of alternative music.  This disc takes effort to listen to.  It's weird and a little world unto itself.  Not my favorite part of the set as it goes a little too far with the art rock whim.<br />On a personal note, this was a set I sort of re-discovered.  I got it way back when it came out, but haven't listened to it for years.  Lately I have been listening to a lot of the mid-90's music that I miss so much these days.  Finding this set in my closet was like finding a time capsule.
2070364232|5.0|Bought this to develop French reading skills. It's a kids' book, of course, and I'm a grown-up, but it absolutely cracks me up. Each chapter is a little short story following Nicolas and his gang of friends. Imagine Our Gang or Peanut, but in French, and ten times funnier because of the cultural incongruity. Nothing like reading a chapter before lights out and stumbling across, \\"Bouge pas, Oklahoma Kid!\\", \\"Tu le regretteras, Joe!\\" And the tiny little cartoons that go along with the story -- cracks me up!
0812550757|5.0|Aalii, obviosly you have not read this book to its full potential. You are ready to discredit a genius writer whom has written many a great book. You are also not afraid to use big words to frighten potential readers who might love this book! Please, do not shoot down a book which other people enjoy. You notice that other people have given this book very good reviews, but not you. So please, think before you type, and just quietly accept that this is a book which you don't like. I loved this book, and I would appreciate it if you didn't maim another one of O.S.C.'s books. Thank you.<br />-A reader of SciFi
B0000640VO|5.0|I absolutely adore Amelie.  I came across it in an interview with Elijah Wood without even hearing about it so, I went out and rented it and fell in love. Since then, I've bought the movie, the poster and the soundtrack all of which are fantastic. I give it a 5, a movie that will be cherished for years to come.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie is downright FUNNY.  As an 18 year old I found this a very amusing movie.  Although some parts were rediculously dumb I find myself watching it over and over.  This is kind of in the genre of The Emporors New Groove.  It has puns for both the older and younger audience.  Heee funny.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|As I watched the movie &quot;The Hours&quot;, I knew I had to have the soundtrack.  The music just flows and is so moving. As a former piano student I especially like music (classical and pop) where the piano is predominant.  When all the tracks are so beautiful, it is hard to say any one is my favorite but I am partial to &quot;Morning Passages&quot;.  The soundtrack helped make the movie and Philip Glass should win an Academy Award for it.  Hearing this soundtrack makes we want to get to know Philip Glass' other music as well.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|This album actually surprised me because most soundtracks these days suck. anyways...<br />Lose Yourself - 4.5/5 - I'd give it 5, but this song gets boring. The beat is good though, although it very closely resembles Till I Collapse on The Eminem Show.<br />Love Me - 4.5/5 - A great song by Eminem and the newest members of his Shady Records label.<br />8 Mile - 4.5/5 - This would've been better if Em made it a bit shorter. (it's six minutes) but it was good anyways.<br />Adrenaline Rush - 2.5/5 - Obie is setting a bad image for himself and his upcoming album. He is always outshined by 50. This song isn't good, he should've had a different one to go with it or even better, instead of it.<br />Places To Go - 3/5 - This is okay...the beat isn't the greatest, but it's better than Adrenaline Rush.<br />Rap Game - 4.5/5 - D12's addition to the cd is pretty good. Em makes a good verse using pig latin. pretty funny actually...you might be expecting bizarre to ruin it, but he doesn't....at least, not as much.<br />8 Miles and Runnin - 4/5 - This would be a near perfect song without Freeway...his voice is just annoying. The beat is so-so, but Jay-Z has a great flow on this track.<br />Spit Shine - 3/5 - meh...Xhibit could've done better than this...(should've)<br />Time of My Life - 0/5 - I never listen to this, it's just bad.<br />U Wanna Be Me - 2/5 - Actually not a dis to Jay-Z...it's not a very good song.<br />Wanksta - 4.5/5 - This song was actually on one of his older album, funny how it becomes a hit right now....anyways, it's a good dis to Ja, and an even better song.<br />Wasting My Time - 0.5/5 - This and the Macy Gray song are both useless to the cd.<br />R.A.K.I.M. - 1/5 - Ughh.....(that pretty much sums it up)<br />That's My N***a Fo Real - 1/5 - Just as bad as R.A.K.I.M.<br />Battle - 5/5 - FINALLY something good! The end of the cd was beginning to seem like total garbage until this one. Can't wait till Gang Starr's next album...<br />Rabbit Run - 4.5/5 - This is a pretty good song.<br />-->SAMPLER&lt;--<br />Three songs here are from Shady Records, and three are from Aftermath Entertainment.

It also uses bits of the hook from Drips.<br />*SHADY* Stimulate - 5/5 - One of tracks that was cut from The Eminem Show, this is a great song. Talks about how people take him too seriously, and how he's only here to entertain.<br />*SHADY* Till I Collapse Freestyle - 4.5/5 - Nothing really new, 50 freestyles over Em's Till I Collapse. It's a great freestyle though.<br />*AFTERMATH* Gangsta - 1/5 - Really sounds like Snoop when he says Gangsta in the background...anyways, like obie, if this is how they're gonna promote him, I don't think I'm lookin forward to his debut much.<br />*AFTERMATH* The Weekend - 3/5 - An okay song from one of the recently-signed-to-Aftermath artists.

B000056VIY|5.0|In July 1999, Jennifer Lopez burst onto the music scene with her debut album On The 6. Her debut single If You Had My Love stormed straight to No.1 in the US where it stayed for 5 weeks and sold more than 1 million copies. 1999 was the year of a worldwide Latin explosion with Ricky Martin leading the pack - Ms Lopez was also a big contributor to this phenomenon and firmly established herself as a female superstar with the X-factor. Jennifer returned in January 2001 with her second album J.Lo. She was back with a new sound, a new image and a new attitude. Needless to say, the album sold more than 10 million copies worldwide and was teaming with countless worldwide No.1 hits. The public loved the album's title and soon started calling Jennifer Lopez \\"J.Lo,\\" a nickname that still stands today, or should that be \\"Jenny\\"?<br />J.Lo opens with Love Don't Cost A Thing (10/10). The first single to be taken from J.Lo, this superb and downright funkadelic R'n'B monster topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic in January 2001. The video is superb and was quick to capitalise of Jennifer's stunning body - one that every man drooled over, yet every woman envied. Ms Lopez was even rumoured to have secured her now legendary bum for a whopping $300 million - $700 million for the rest of her flawless body! Track 2 is I'm Real (9/10). This was the fourth and final single to be released from J.Lo in November 2001 where it peaked at No.4 in the UK. This is not the Ja Rule Remix version, yet is still as good. Track 3 is Play (10/10). Quite simply the greatest Jennifer Lopez single to be released...ever, this superb and insanely catchy dance/pop track was released in April 2001 where it peaked at No.3 in the UK. The video is superb - her best to date infact. Track 4 is Walking On Sunshine (10/10). This brilliant song is (in my opinion) the greatest non-released track on the whole album. The whole upbeat mood of the song is undeniably funky and the bouncy bassline will have you jigging along in no time. This song always reminds me of summer 2001 when I used to listen to the song non-stop, day in day out throughout the 6-week holidays! Track 5 is Ain't It Funny (10/10). This superb Latino monster hit was released in August 2001 where it peaked at No.3 in the UK and was another massive hit worldwide. This was actually the song that made me buy this album. Track 6 is Carino (10/10 - how on Earth do you put the darn swigly bits above the letters?!). This is a superb Spanish song - sung entirely Spanish. I don't understand the lyrics, yet (like with some of the songs on Shakira's Laundry Service) the beat takes over and the lyrics become superfluous. Track 7 is Come Over. This is slow and saucy ballad, with some very naughty lyrics if I do say so myself, Ms Lopez! Tsk! Tsk! Tracks 8 and 9 are We Gotta Talk (10/10) and That's Not Me (9/10). The former has a superb R'n'B bassline while the latter has a insanely supersonic chorus. Believe me when I say it'll take you quite a few listens to master the lyrics!<br />Track 10 is Dance With Me (8/10). This is an average, mid-tempo song with a portion of Latino-flare. Nothing to really rave about! Track 11 is Secretly (7/10). Quite possibly the slowest song I've ever heard (even the laughable Westlife sing faster!), this song has to be the worst on the album. I suppose it's OK if you want to relax, but I bought this album to get my groove-thang on! Track 12 is I'm Gonna Be Alright (10/10). Aaaah, J.Lo back on top form is what I like to see with this superb slice of pop/R'n'B. This isn't the single version which was released in July 2002, but a much more up-tempo version. Track 13 is That's The Way (10/10). This is yet another excellent R'n'B track - instantly recognisable as a Darkchild production with the deep voices and funky trademark bassline. Track 14 is Dame (9/10). A lot of people hate this song, but I actually quite like it. She repeats the \\"Dame\\" word a bit too often, but it's J.Lo - and she's a goddess, so we can forgive her! Track 15 is Si Ya Se Acabo (10/10 - where's those darn swigly bits for the top of foreign words again?!). This is the best Spanish song on the whole album in my opinion - the beat is fast and funky, while the chorus is catchy and brilliant. A great song to close J.Lo!<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />All in all, if there's one Jennifer Lopez album I would recommend, it's definitely J.Lo because it is just so full of superb dance, pop, Latin and R'n'B monster songs. This was the album that made Jennifer Lopez become one of the leading ladies in music along with Britney, Madonna and Kylie. Let's hope she keeps on producing great albums like this in the future.ddess, so we can forgive her!

B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah Carey's sixth album Daydream was released in October 1995 and literally ruled the charts; topping the US chart for 10 weeks and selling more than 22 million copies worldwide - 14 million of that in the US alone. At the time Daydream was released, it was definitely Mariah's greatest album to date and contained some amazing singles - which is probably the prime reason the album did so well. Like Music Box, Daydream is very ballad-heavy but also has that superb hint of up-tempo material that blends so perfectly well to make such an excellent album.<br /><br />Daydream begins with the superb lead single \\"Fantasy.\\" The first single to be taken from Daydream, Fantasy is by far my all-time favourite Mariah Carey single. It topped the US chart for a lengthy 8 consecutive weeks and was the first-ever single to go straight in at No.1 by a female artist...just one of the many records Mariah has broken this past decade! The song just simply swings with its bouncy and pure pop theme. The bassline is deep and mysterious and that superb sample of the Tom Tom Club's \\"Genius Of Love\\" is unforgettable. Fantasy is one of those rare songs that still sounds as fresh today as it did back in 1995. \\"Underneath The Stars\\" is up next and is such an amazing mid-tempo ballad. The song is about young love and how good it feels to be in love for the first time - very innocent and cheeky. The song has a brilliant and catchy vocal arrangement in the verses and the bit where Mariah croons, \\"Weak in the knees\\" at the beginning of the second verse is very classy. Well, what can be said about \\"One Sweet Day\\" that hasn't been said before? The words phenomenal, mind-blowing, amazing and superb all spring to mind. This duet with Boyz II Men became Mariah's 8th US No.1, but what's even more amazing is that it topped the US chart for a record 4 MONTHS! Yes, this superb ballad topped the charts for 16 weeks and is officially the longest-running No.1 single in the history of the US singles chart - and deservedly so.<br /><br />\\"Open Arms\\" is the song on track 4 and is another brilliant Mariah ballad, which peaked at No.4 in the UK. The verses are dramatic and the choruses are sweeping - and the lyrics? Don't even get me started on how superb they are! \\"Always Be My Baby\\" was the fourth and final single to be taken from this album and peaked at No.3 in the UK in June 1996. It was also Mariah's 10th US No.1 single - surprise, surprise! This superb mid-tempo ballad is very popular amongst Mariah fans, and it's easy to see why; the beat is warm, the verses are breathy and the choruses are catchy. \\"I Am Free\\" is another superb song, on the endless list of ballads. The lyrics are the most praise-worthy factor of this song, which give off strong suggestions of Mariah's relationship with her then-husband Tommy Motola. \\"When I Saw You\\" is a very emotional ballad with some tear-jerking lyrics. \\"Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me/Transcending space and time/And I was rendered still/There were no words for me to find at all/As I stood there beside myself/I could see you and no one else,\\" croons Mariah in the first verse. The song builds up to a splendid climax towards the end, when Mariah just lets loose and warbles her heart out with that other-worldy voice.<br /><br />\\"Long Ago\\" is an absolutely brilliant song, and is a welcome change from the ballads that previously set the scene for the majority of Daydream. This song has a very R'n'B feel to it, and is a strong indicator of the style Mariah would thrust herself into on her next album Butterfly. Infact, the song would sound perfect on Butterfly. The bassline is deep and sort of muffled and Mariah's vocals are strong and distinctive. \\"Melt Away\\" is another ballad from Mariah that is well above average. The song starts off sounding like Whitney Houston's Saving All My Love For You, but comes into its own when Mariah's vocals enter - Mariah's vocals are better than Whitney's aren't they?...Of course they are!<br /><br />\\"Forever\\" is a rather unusual type of song from Mariah. It's obviously a ballad, but has a rather catchy beat to it - the vocal arrangement definitely helps this along. \\"Daydream Interlude - Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix\\" is quite different. This superb dance interlude of Fantasy is a welcome change of pace from the rest of Daydream. The beat is reminiscent of all those no-good one-hit wonders from the early 1990s, but is much more acceptable than that twaddle. \\"Looking In\\" is the perfect song to close Daydream and is a superb ballad about how Mariah addresses all those critics and haters who just see her as a rich girl with money to burn and a great pair of lungs. Mariah tells it like it is through superb sounds and emotive lyrical writing. Superb.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Along with \\"Music Box,\\" \\"Butterfly\\" and the excellent \\"Charmbracelet,\\" I definitely consider Daydream an essential Mariah Carey album for your collection. The way the deep and sweeping ballads are integrated with the dashes of R'n'B, pop and dance makes for one of the most consistent albums of the decade.f song from Mariah.

B000084T18|5.0|This is the sweetest CD ive ever heard. It just like downloading songs off the internet and making a custom Cd. Everyone that likes rap should have this CD.  Every song is as tight as the next. you have to buy it!
B00007KWI9|5.0|Other reviews of this album have pegged it as sort of an embryonic precursor of things to come from Yes.   I suppose that's fair--but for my money, that is one of the beautiful things about the album: The sweet vocals, catchy melodies and potent Squire_Bruford rhythm section don't get buried behind overly complex arrangements, synthesizers or too many chords in too few seconds.  It's fair to call this a pop album with a progressive edge, and this reissue not only brings it out in crisp sound quality gloriously superior to the 1994 Atlantic reissue, but also boasts six bonus tracks (two versions of each of three songs.)  Both versions of Stephen Stills' &quot;Everydays&quot; are superior to the &quot;Time &amp; A Word&quot; album version (not to mention miles ahead of the Buffalo Springfield original), and both versions of &quot;Dear Father&quot; have a driving, urgent quality absent from the version previously available on &quot;Yesterdays,&quot; and now on the reissue of the above-mentioned second Yes album.  About the only disappointing thing I can come up with regarding this cd is: I had hoped when I learned it was being expanded and remastered that one of the bonus cuts would be the &quot;Yesterdays&quot; remix of &quot;Survival,&quot; which features some pretty psychedelic phasing on the choruses.  That aside, I could not recommend this product any more highly for fans of late Sixties-early Seventies British progressive pop/rock.  _I love it; think I'm going to throw it on again right now.
B000062Y98|4.0|I'm torn between my irrational love for Blind Guardian and my love for metal when I say I was a little disapointed with \\"A Night at the Opera.\\" We see much evidence of Hansi being a born-again Christian(the truth!) in these lyrics, and there is that theme and the Trojan War in \\"And Then There was Silence,\\" the best song on the album in my opinion. It is 14 minutes long, but it seems barely a minute over 6 or 7. Memorizing the lyrics is easier than you would think, even though there is only a pseudo-chorus that is repeated 3 times. It might be because I've listened to it so many times. <BR> Anyway, if you want to hear Hansi scream his lungs out, get \\"Imaginations from the Other Side,\\" or something of the sort. If you want more uplifting music, get \\"A Night at the Opera.\\" Also something I don't like is the fact that Hansi is no longer playing bass, or at least not on this cd, and guitarists Andre and Marcus aren't singing backup. If you've been a BG fan and you know them well, this is probably worth the money.
B00000J7JO|4.0|This is a great album, but their are a few weak tracks about halfway through. If you are new to the Chili's this is a good album to start on. This album is not as good as it's predessor One Hot Minute or successor By The Way. Their best album without a doubt is One Hot Minute, but again, this is a better album to introduce yourself to the band.
B000084T18|5.0|I bought this CD and i am absolutely amazed at how many good &quot;single&quot; possible songs there are on here. For anyone to say they hate this CD...they are just haters. I think 50 cent and Dr. Dre teamed up brilliantly to put together this awesome album.  The best songs include...patiently waiting w/ eminem, if i cant, u like my style, lifes on the line, in da club, P.I.M.P, and 21 questions, and this is only a short list of the best songs on the CD, they are all very good, and if you download these and check them out you will be very impressed, 50 cent has tight lyrics, mixed with Dre's beats, and eminem, this is a must have CD, go out and buy it today, im tellin you, you wont be disaapointed!
B00005YW4H|4.0|She has a great voice and make cute songs, but her music is not so fantastic as people think. Of course she's gonna win the Grammy Award for best new artist, cuz she is better than posers like Avril Lavigne . It's a good cd,the songs she made are well fit, but the original versions of the other songs are much better.

It's about a 30 year old woman working at a dead end job with a loser, pot smoking, husband who doesn't treat her right and she falls in love with the guy at work. She ends up pregnant and instead of telling her pot smoking husband that it's over she lets him believe he is the father of the baby. Why in the world would she want him to raise her child? She found her true love with the guy at work who worships the ground she walks on. When she dumps him he ends up dead and she couldn't care less. She continues to work at the job she hates, stays married to the drug addicted husband and raises the dead guy's baby with him. That's the ending. What the...?
0694003611|5.0|This must be the most classic storybook of all time. It was my favorite to read to my son at bedtime when he was younger. Margaret Wise Brown tells us in her book of the great green room (where a little rabbit is going to bed), describing first many of the delightful things around the room, and then we hear the little rabbit saying goodnight to the room, the moon, the cow jumping over the moon, and the other things that are in the room. I really like the part where there is a blank page and it says \\"goodnight nobody\\" and the next page is \\"goodnight mush\\".  If you have a small child, this book is a must for bedtime reading! I was reading this book to my son when he was an infant, so it is never too soon to start. As a toddler, he never tired of hearing \\"Goodnight Moon\\" each night.
6305531374|1.0|Having seen all 6 of the previous Halloween films, I can safely say that H20 was by far the worst. It even \\"borrows\\" scences from other Halloween films - the dumbwaiter scene from 5?, the \\"we shot the wrong guy\\" scene from 4, the \\"Micahel being thrown off the truck and then hit\\" scene from 4, among others. Rather than devloping the characters, using their traits, any carefully and artfully killing them off, as in the original films, here Micahel just stumbles in and starts slashing, like in the case of this movies \\"sexually rambucntious teens\\" who get slashed up looking for a corckscrew in the kitchen (not spoiling any suprises here, its completely predictable).  Rather than appearing in shadows with abrupt and ominous music, you see Michael walking down the street in plain view. Myers is so pitiful, he even gets punched out in one scene. People have said that 4-6 were terrible, and they really dont match the original, but this movie was just pointless garbage, even with Jamie Lee Curtis.
0553381709|5.0|With his brilliant &quot;A Game of Thrones,&quot; George R. R. Martin established a tremendously high expectation for the rest of his series, and somehow, things just keep getting better. This, the third book in &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire,&quot; is even more engrossing than its predecessors.<br />As we've come to expect from Martin, the various plotlines in the story continue to move in completely realistic, yet not at all predictable directions. This series has a level of suspense to it that is unmatched by any of the other epic fantasies currently out there. We become closer still to many of the masterfully constructed characters, and of course, we have to let a few of them go. Some of the mysteries that have been with us since the first book are resolved in this volume, and some of the answers are not what you'd expect. This is particularly true of the very last chapter (not the epilogue); you'll be awed when you realize the enormity of what a certain character has accomplished...<br />This book has two POV (point of view) characters that did not appear in the previous books: Samwell Tarly of the Night's Watch, and more interestingly, Jamie Lannister. Even though events on the Wall are quite interesting, I don't much care for Samwell as a character, so I don't think much is added there. The insight into Jamie's mind is wonderful, though. We certainly know something of the Kingslayer's infamy from the first two books, but here we get a better look into his motivations, and his thoughts on honor, and on the way other people see him. We find that Jamie is not at all black or white, but somewhere in the gray area in between, like his brother Tyrion, though not as much so. Martin has stated that book 4 will have Cersei as a POV character, which should be interesting as well.<br />We also get to spend some time with Sandor Clegane (though not from his POV), who fled from King's Landing after the Battle of the Blackwater. This was something else I really enjoyed, since Sandor is one of my favorite characters. While he certainly seems more of a villain than a hero, he does have a curious sort of honor to him as well, and is a very well-drawn character.<br />The only complaint I could level against the book is that for me, some of the plotlines have become less interesting than others, which can be a little frustrating since Martin jumps to a new POV with every chapter. I find myself going through Bran's chapters as quickly as possible so I can get onto someone else, likewise for Daenerys, and to a lesser extent, Davos. It's not that these elements of the story are not well done, but I find Bran irritating, Daenerys scarcely less so, and Davos is surrounded by characters whose deaths wouldn't displease me. The stories taking place in southern Westeros and on the Wall are just more interesting to me. That's my only complaint, though, and it's not a big one. The series just wouldn't be the same if it were done any other way.<br />If you haven't read the first two books, make sure you do before reading this one. It's necessary to have a full appreciation for what is the finest of the epic fantasies. The only bad part is the wait between volumes; abandoning the Seven Kingdoms for reality is such a disappointment!
0156012197|5.0|An 80 page book, that when you read for the first time you would think it is only a kids book. I have read this book at least 10 times now, and every time it teaches you something new about the little prince travels, his experience with the different planets, and people he meets.<br />The little prince adventues leave the bigest influence on the adults, and the way they look at life. He shows how people have changed so much, and how they have lost the value in seeing the beauty in the small things. Everything seems the same to them, and their actions demostrate that.<br />The little prince left his planet, to understand the people more, and to find the best rose he can ever find, after all the travelling he did, and the questions he asked, he discovered that being content and making the best of what he had is the right way to approach life, he just wished everybody saw it the same way.<br />If you never read any other book in your life, make sure you read this...
0151003084|5.0|The Gashlycrumb Tinies is for those with a macabre, but light sense of humor. It is an A to Z tale of children meeting their doom.<br />WARNING: Please buy this book ONLY if you understand Edward Gorey. He has an odd sense of humor and it is certainly one-of-a kind. The content in this book is not meant to be taken seriously.
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent is really a great rapper. He's been underground for a while but now his first album under Shady Records is really good. Although it is not like the classic Big and Pac album, all the songs are quality. My favorites are 'In Da Club' 'Paciently Waiting' 'Heat' and '21 Questions.' I strongly recommend buying this album if you like Eminem, Dr. Dre, Tupac, Biggie Smalls, or any major rapper.
B00005QXDD|3.0|The show was great... the CD is OK. Jack Black and Kyle Gass created this outrageous duo and the HBO show was a definite riot. Their inflated self-importance and over the top folk/metal worked very well with the visual components their show gave the viewer. Left without Black's mugging and Gass's bemused reactions the CD has only the music; music that can wear thin after repeated listening. There are some clever tunes and bits here. \\"Kielbasa, \\"is fine example of Tenacious D's preoccupation with sex (a topic that appears many times throughout the CD.) \\"Tribute\\" is an excellent example of how funny this band can be when their inflated self-importance reaches new heights, and \\"City Hall\\" the lengthy closer which deals with a world ruled by these two maniacs ends the only way it could; with mutual betrayal. Other songs like \\"Lee,\\" \\"Explosivo,\\" \\"Double Team Supreme,\\" and \\"Rock Your Socks\\" wear out there welcome almost immediately. I still smile when I listen to this, but I find I skip through about half the material.

B000002LFZ|2.0|If all you want is a collection of Fleetwood Mac's hits this one's fine. All the hits are here (from 1975-1988) and if that's all you expect from a greatest hits collection, you won't be disappointed. But even a casual fan of the band (like me) found this to be a little less than I expected. The liner notes are the pits; a behind the scenes look at a 1988 concert (w/o Buckingham) with no insight into the songs in the collection. There aren't even songwriter credits (although there are production credits)! I'm not reviewing the songs here, but the packaging. I feel a band that is this talented and popular deserves a better package for their best material.
B000001FYL|5.0|Its hard to believe that this came out 13 years ago and yet at the same time i cant imagine what the last 13 years of my life would be like without this cd. It has got me through a lot of tough times.When I was angry at school I would listen to it at lunch and let jons words sooth my soul enough to get me through the day.When I was angry at work I would run to my truck and again I would let jon get me through the day.&quot;Bang a drum&quot; means so much...Thanks Jon for writing a great record that stands on its own 2 feet to this day
B000059PPX|5.0|Many have written poorly about Candy.  Perhaps, they took the movie too seriously because there are many moments that are genuinely amusing: the soldiers doing a dance number and eliciting a tear from their commander, Candy's uncle unplugging his brother as he recuperates in the hospital, the concept of a \\"Post-Operative Bash\\", McPhisto's made up stories, and the entire Brando scene.  <BR> What I think is the main reason for people disliking this movie is that it wasn't what they expected it to be.  It's trippy and a little weird at times.  The music is also amazing.  If you don't like Steppenwolf or the Byrds, perhaps you shouldn't bother.  <BR>The Bottom line: this movie is a riot if you have the right mindset watching it.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This intimidating two-disc set seems to span Dream Theater's talent from low to high, from soft to hard and from straight to progressive. The 42 minute title track rests on a seperate CD that I found myself to initially play more than the first disc, which had to grow on me. It's not that much of a surprise coming from DT that their 2 disc longest studio album contains only 6 songs, keeping with an interesting theme of six degrees of inner turbulence.<br />Degree one, \\"The Glass Prison\\" is one of DT's most experimental and heavy tracks ever. Soaring riffs and melodies showcase the insane talent of Petrucci and Portnoy, as the lyrics range from short quick growls to LaBrie's usual soaring operettics. This complex track comes in three pieces and spans 14 minutes, but is over way too soon, as it gets progressivly better as the track moves along. The time signatures in this song change quite rapidly and sometimes lead to an odd sound more apropos to Rush than Dream Theater. To make matters short Glass Prison is the best track to be found on the first disc, an epic soaring prog metal anthem that will be a future classic to all progheads.<br />Degree two is \\"Blind Faith\\" which despite it's 9 minute legnth and soaring choruses, would sound more at home on DT's 1997 release \\"Falling into Infinity\\" as it presents a more straight edged metal with pop sensibilities. Not bad by any means, Blind Faith is remarkable as the weakest track on the entire album, it's agnostic lyrics being the strongest stregnth. Blind Faith rambles on a bit too long, a shortened version on a different album (such as Falling Into Infinity) would have been much more apropriate)<br />Degree Three is \\"Misunderstood\\" a solem ode to a diminished ego that is brilliantly stoic, LaBrie's mechanical vocal approach in this song highlighted by a more subdued Guitar melody from Petrucci and some of the best Drumwork on a softer song that Portnoy has ever done. Somehow far more rousing than DT's more hard edged epics, Misunderstood is unforgettable.<br />Degree Four is \\"The Great Debate\\" a fence sitter of a song about Stem Cell research, which if it isn't obvious enough from a quick glance at the lyrics, is apparent in the sound bytes that appear during the intro and outro, somehow strangely musical, and even building to a crescendo in the outro. Rush inspired structure, but with far better vocals, The Great Debate comes very close to the greatness of The Glass Prison. Thought provoking and beautiful<br />Degree Five is probably the least listened-to track on the album, \\"Disapear\\" Which showcases writing by LaBrie, something almost unheard of from Dream Theater. This haunting track is subdued but still soars, the perfect companion to Misunderstood. The instrumental pieces create a moody atmosphere that make this song almost spooky in it's ambience.<br />Degree Six is the 42 minute tour de force with the theme of insanity, spanning 8 sections and 6 stories of 6 people with 6 different mental inflictions such as bipolar disorder, autism, post partem depression and such. The song starts with an orchestrated intro, the musical fireworks being an interesting segue to the more pop sensible second part with it's catchy chorus and slight subtle reprises of the intro. Then an excellent metal section and a softer one, with an excellent instrumental ending to that one. DT switches back to catchy and references several other musicians, most notably Rush and Queen. The song ends in a building crescendo and a final note that is at least 2 minutes long, leaving the listener spent and exhausted. This long title track brings you to soaring peaks and leaves you exhilarated and tired, comparisons to the sexual act are hard to avoid, this song is just plain orgasmic in just about every way. <br />With these five songs and one that could only be described as a progmetal symphony, DT has put together one of their most ambitious works, experimenting with new techniques and being progressive, as they should be. For anybody who has ever even HEARD of prog, this is a must own.
B0000797IO|1.0|I think Jennifer Aniston is a great actress but this movie doesn't do her justice.  I thought I was going to be watching a great movie and was very disappointed to find out how boring and uneventful the whole movie was.  There was absolutely nothing good about this movie and anyone wanting to buy it I would have to say if you really want to watch the movie rent it or borrow it from somebody before you waste your money!!!
B00006ALGL|5.0|Never having heard of Damien Rice before, I was so moved by The Blower's Daughter, I bought the CD and it's all I've been listening to since. I have not been this impressed with new artists and their music since first hearing many of today's legends back in the sixties. Every single track on this CD is excellent. Damien's voice and passion, the strings, the orchestration, and Lisa's sweet and extraordinarily pretty voice combine to make a true masterpiece. I've always had a \\"favorite\\" movie (Citizen Kane) but never a favorite CD/album -- until now -- and I could not recommend it more highly.
B00006GA4C|4.0|If you consider yourself a fan of Grand Funk Railroad, I highly recommend this album for several reasons: <br />First, I've always had a lot of trouble reading liner notes on remastered albums, but this one contained a lot of fun anecdotes and little-known facts about the recording sessions (the band's drummer, Don Brewer, tells a lot of great stories).<br />Second, it sounds great! This was the first remastered GFR album I bought, and I had bought four albums before it: On Time, the Live Album, Closer to Home, and We're An American Band. I have to say that I was disappointed with the audio quality of each, especially Closer to Home. Don't get me wrong, the music was great, it was just hard to hear without turning the volume on my stereo up high. With the remasters, the band is finally being heard the way they were meant to. If you have a pacemaker on, I'd use caution, because Mel Schacher's bass guitar just might cause complications.<br />And finally, there's the music itself. It seems funny to put it at the bottom of the list, but I like to save the best for last. In all honesty, I'd have to say that the A-Side of the Red Album sounds too similar to the A-Side of &quot;On Time&quot; (High-Falootin' Woman is almost a dead ringer for High On A Horse or Time Machine). They're fun songs to listen to, but it's not until track number 5 (In Need) that the band members finally burst out of their shells. &quot;In Need&quot; has a magnificent &quot;jam session&quot; feel to it, something that carries over to the better half of the album, the B-Side. &quot;Winter And My Soul&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot; were early attempts by lead singer/guitarist/songwriter Mark Farner to blend meaningful lyrics with the vibrant rhythms and nasty guitar licks of downtown, gritty rock, something which he does well (Paranoid contains one of Farner's best guitar solos ever). Before I go on, I just want to add that Paranoid should not be confused with the Black Sabbath song. GFR just happenedto record an original song that happened to have the same title.<BR>Anyway, the B-Side finishes with the band's first cover, Inside Looking Out (a song originally written by Farner's favorite British Invasion group, the Animals). This song, to put it simply, rocks! The best thing about it (and the three songs before it) is that it meanders in every direction, almost as if the band is not sure where they're going to go next, but all the while, Mel Schacher and Don Brewer manage to keep it on some sort of track. <br />I find it hard to listen to an album all the way through if it has a series of long songs on it, but the first time I sat down and played the Red Album on my discman, I stuck with it till the end. It's not their best album, but it did set the standard for Grand Funk Railroad's high time: that period between 1970 and 1973 (before keyboardist Craig Frost joined the roster) when the band recorded all their best music.
B00006ALGL|5.0|I was so moved by the Blower's Daughter, I bought the CD and it's all I've been listening to since! The first review on here described the music very well. While lots of music touches the soul, this music gets in there and wrings it! I can't remember being this impressed with artists as well as their album/CD since Cat Stevens back in the sixties. EVERY SINGLE CUT on this CD is excellent. The combination of Damien's voice, his passion, the strings and orchestration, Lisa's sweet, haunting voice... This is truly a masterpiece..! I've always had a \\"favorite\\" movie (Citizen Kane) -- now I finally have a favorite CD...!
B00005JLZL|1.0|I was an extra in this film. I live in Huntsville, Texas, and I played an anti death penalty protester. Now, I'm a liberal in real life and also against the death penalty (probably the only person IN Huntsville who is, it seems sometimes), and even though the message of the film seems very anti death penalty itself, the film's moralistic, preachy message made me uncomfortable. If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church. This is typical, liberal Hollywood propaganda. If I want to see a film addressing a controversial issue, I prefer for the film to use valid points from BOTH sides of said issue, in order to gain more understanding of what is being presented. This movie not only preached, it was mind-numbingly BORING, and the \\"twist\\" was easy to figure out way, way before it was revealed. It's the kind of manipulative Hollywood tearjerker that tries to make the audience sob and howl at the \\"poor plight\\" of this wrongly accused man, and it's shallow, pointless, EXCEEDINGLY cliche (ripe with horrible dialogue), and did I forget to mention BORING? I had fun as an extra, and I was looking forward to seeing it, but ultimately I am disappointed. Not to mention, Kate Winslet was a complete and absolute spoiled primadonna, VERY hard to work with, and totally self-centered. But that's another story.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fight Club is a wonderful movie.  Even though it gets a little weird and past itself at the end, it is still great to watch.  Fincher is one of the best directors around and never compromises.  Norton and Pitt are top notch as usual.  <br />The first half of the film is really the best.  \\"The things you own, end up owning you.\\"  The scene where Pitt threatens the 7-11 clerk to follow his dream of being a veteranarian or he'll kill him.  Why men join the \\"fight clubs.\\" These are themes that I wish the movie would have explored more.  Instead the second half takes us on a rollercoaster plot to blow up a bunch of office buildings.<br />Another great Fincher film.  Doesn't hold a candle to SEVEN though.
0375414053|1.0|Was very disappointed with this book after reading such great reviews. Yes, it is well written- the Brits have a way with comedic writing- but my God. Throughout the book Kate Reddy struggles to balance a high powered job as a financial advisor with husband and 2 children, railing at the Sloaney stay-at-home full time mothers who deride her for her working mother status. This group is very well characterized and described- appalling types- and bright beautiful Kate suddenly at the end joins them. Quits her job, buys a home in the country with a paddock, and joins the PTA while her husband works on building a rock wall. Its as if Allison Pearson stopped writing this book several chapters from the end and it was completed by her alter ego, a stay at home wealthy mother. Extremely disappointing- and in fact, unrealistic. The majority of women in this country need to work- it is not a luxurious option to be tossed away when its time for a change. Ms. Pearson does a wonderful humorous job of describing the conflict this role provides- then provides a completely unrealistic sappy pat solution, one not available to those of us who do not have the luxury of having a husband who can provide. And why on God's earth did she become one of \\"them\\", the very group she so delightfully disparages, the minority of women who take pride in their cooking, their ability to get their children into tony prep schools, who spend all of their time arranging play dates and sending thank you notes? She leads the reader to believe this is the only solution to a happy life. Its appalling.<br />Save your money. This book will inevitably make you angry...

(except maybe a clansman <remembering frank>)  this movie is beautiful,tear jerking,  witty, inteligent, and downright funny.  wether your a rebellious teenager or a 67 year old woman or man, i dont care who you are, this movie is for you..  for any mood your in its the right mood to watch friend green tomatoes...  i guarentee you will love it...  though of course if your the mother of a small child you might wanna hold your hands over your kids ears during the trial scene where idgie starts off saying \\"thats right you <a bunch of words that would be quickly censored off this sight>...\\".  its the story of 3 people.  as its shown directly its of 4 but its known that idgie is actually ms ninny threadgood though evilyn begins to realise it ninny never offers to say it either..  but its the story of an overweight housewife with a low self esteem and how hearing a old woman from a nursing homes story about the life of 2 young rebels from alabama.  its not a depressing movie.  its too funny to be though it is sad from start to finish but they have a humor about things that makes you laugh reguardless...  you go through murer trials with them,  wife beatings, poker games, getting drunk at the local honkey tonk, playing baseball drunk on whiskey, train hopping, and just about everything imaginable as well as a love between two best friends...<BR>it starts out with idgie as a little girl and her brother buddy, though buddy is only in the movie for one or 2 quick scenes, he is a strong character in the movie because it is about what came after his death and how he was idgies mentor, brother, and basically she becomes a female buddy as she grows up, also taking on his biggest trait, she became a compulsive liar...  she hated ruth because ruth was buddy's love and idgie wanted buddy all to herself and it takes almost a decade for her to even talk to her but what unfolds is a story of love and friendship that cant be broken.<BR>if you havent seen this movie you need to...  its worth whatever you have to pay for it..  -Lacy Thomas
B00004Z4WR|5.0|For all those people who knock this movie so badly, I have to ask.  Why do you take this movie so seriously?  Gone in 60 Seconds was not meant to be Oscar material.  It was meant to be an exciting action movie with impressive stunts.  Starring Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, the movie boasts an impressive cast that is underused.  Still the movie is great at what it set out to do.  The car chases are some of the best since Bullit.<br /> The plot is a simple one.  Memphis Raines, a famous car booster, has to steal 50 exotic cars or else his kid brother(Giovanni Ribisi) will get taken out by a mob boss.  It isn't the deepest plot but it works in this movies.  Memphis(Nicolas Cage) puts together a team to help him steal the cars.  Obviously the plan doesn't go perfectly as Memphis and crew run into rival boosters, police chasing after them, and the ever elusive \\"Eleanor,\\" Memphis' unicorn.  <br /> Gone in 60 Seconds is a fun movie to watch with good performances, exciting action sequences, and an awesome soundtrack.  Sure the movie isn't great moviemaking but it succeeds at what it set out to do.  The movie has its mistakes but anyone who goes through and makes a long list of them needs to lighten up.  It is just a movie.  The DVD is great with piles of extras that talk about the cast and the stunts.
B000055XMF|4.0|This is basically the same story as Saturday Night Fever.  Two gangs, hanging out and one guy (focus of the story) likes Girl A but Girl B is the one that likes him.  He won't have it and will do anything to get Girl A.  This is a bit more dark than Saturday Night Fever.  Is it the grey English weather?  The 60's film?  I don't know - but Sting is a stylin' mod on a Vespa GS and is the envy of the entire Mod community.   It shows how old he really is.  Watch this to truley see the historic rivalry between the Mods and the Rockers.  Plus it has tons of scooters and a riot in Brighton.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I bought Fiona Apple's first release, 'Tidal' and loved it. Then I bought 'When the Pawn' and found it awesome! Fiona has really grown and matured as an artist on this record. Tracks like &quot;A Mistake&quot; and &quot;Get Gone&quot; show Fiona's angry and hurt side, and &quot;Paper Bag&quot; shows that Fiona loves too. <br />&quot;When the Pawn&quot; is so much different (and better) than &quot;Tidal&quot;. The only tracks that sound anything like Fiona's previous release are &quot;Love Ridden&quot; and &quot;I Know&quot;. &quot;I Know&quot; is my personal favorite on the album. It has a blusey, Ella Fitzgerald sound to it.<br />All and all, this disc is great. Don't hesitate to purchase this if you are a fan of just general music!
0812550757|2.0|I was reading though the reviews and couldn't help but notice that so many people were giving this book  5 stars. I also noticed that the only people who seemed to have some sense in figuring out the obvious flaws in this book were the ones giving it lower ratings. <BR>    I, like others was completely enamored  by Enders Game and rushed out to get the sequel, only to find that it was 3,000 years later with over 90% of the main characters completely different from the first book. Not only that, but the Ender Wiggin that we knew was completely different.  In  the first book I found myself admiring Ender for his invincible genius and insight. There's not a spark of that brillance in this book. Instead, it focuses on the empathetic side of his personality, which made me feel like OSC  cut me off from a side of Ender which I came to know and respect. In a sense, Ender is a complete stranger that  you have to get to know all over again. This is a serious error on OSC's part. Unless the character is a villian , the author should never transform the hero so much that loses the qualities that made the character what he is in the first place. Also, there were other characters in EG that I also liked , so to place the book so far in a future in which none of the previous characters are even alive is a bit depressing. I found that I was incapable of sypathizing with the new characters like I did with the old ones. While reading this book I found myself saying over and over again, (hence the title of my review)\\"Who Cares?\\" Sure, I can feel sorry for Battle school kids who were made to grow up way before their time, but how can OSC really expect anyone to care about pequinos or buggers? I mean, come on!  This is on a planet that is God knows how many light years away and in a future so distant that I can feel absolutely nothing. OSC attempts to give these aliens a somewhat human persona but I find that it just didn't cut it. Call me cold-hearted, but I feel that the author tookthe whole \\"Ender must redeem himself act\\" a bit too far. Even after reading the reasons for his supposed guilt, one still feels that it really wasn't his fault. So.... what was the point of this novel? The only entertaining factor was the mystery of the pequinos but other than that, the plot was quite lacking. Many aspects like, \\"oh my goodness, she's my sister!\\" and  \\"she had six kids with her lover!\\" I felt were soap opera material. Overall, this book was much too emotional for my liking. It just wasn't what I was looking for in a sequel.  <BR>      I know that OSC actually made this book before EG and that EG only served to fill in a gap that was made in  SFTD. But honestly, after reading EG and finding out that it was the better of the two, I feel that OSC should have trashed this book and wrote a different sequel that readers can relate to. I sympathize with the people  who thought that  this novel was too slow- moving and understand their dissapointment. Maybe some many people can deal with the changes that this book has brought about in the Ender series, but I am obviously not one of them.  For readers who agree and feel that they were sadly cheated when reading SFTD, read The shadow series. Those books are much more like EG and redeem this poorly written novel.
1590710037|5.0|...because once you crack it, you will end up reading the whole thing, cover to cover.  Never have I read a book that I felt was written *for me* the way this one was.  Many books on this subject tend to be flowery, fluffy drivel that implores you to \\"find your inner child\\" or some other pretentious [stuff].  This book is the opposite.  It's about shutting up, sitting down and doing the work that is your art, whatever that is.<br />I was in tears more than once.  Absolutely amazing book that should be read by anyone who ever wants to do *anything*.
B0000048V8|5.0|A terrific story.  Very sweet.  My &lt;1 year old niece loves this film.  One of the few truly pure stories you can find.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Knowing how Hollywood has a tendency to butcher a book's adapation to the screen made me very leary to see this film, but, for once, they got it right.  Knowing there is only so much you can put into a 2 hour movie, the deleted scenes (which, by the way, don't make it so difficult to get to) could have been put in the film which would have extended it by about 5 minutes, but they also would have provided some nice transitions and/or more needed background (Dursleys).  The acting was where I would have expected it to be, the sets so realistic I wish they offered tours.  But the basic charm and magic that is found in the books was transferred to the screen intact.  In all, my only real complaint is that it wasn't long enough.   I really look forward to the next installment (provided the same attention to detail is kept).
6304362498|5.0|A movie based on George Orwell's '1984'?  No, the movie IS 1984!  From the air of defeat in the bombed out streets and buildings most people would call 'ruins' to the characters played by such great actors as John Hurt and Richard Burton, Michael Radford REALLY brings the work of literature to the big screen. Filmed during the same time period as the events in the novel it is a story about freedoms, fears and love.<br />Still, the book IS better.<br />NOTE: Have now seen the DVD version.  The music from Euryhmics has been removed, which would not be bad if it had been replaced by silence, but it was replaced by a soundtrack that is bland and feels almost lazy.  Like an after thought.  Book is still better.
B000006NXP|5.0|It's interesting to note that, in the 5 or 6 reviews preceeding mine, and maybe in all of them (I didn't check beyond the first half dozen or so) the fact that this CD is only 40 minutes long is not mentioned by anyone.  You know why that is?  Because the music-making on this disc is so powerful.  It's because this is and will continue to be one of the definitive versions of this symphony.  Kleiber and the VPO never fail to amaze, no matter how many times you've heard this recording.  This recording (along with Kleiber's recording of Beethoven's 5th and 7th) belongs in any serious classical music library.
B00005JL78|4.0|This DVD is good enough to see, especially if you like Tom Cruise flicks. Set in futuristic looking Washington, DC, Minority Report takes you on a wild ride of pre-knowledge crime solving. Police, in the future, have developed a way to know how and when crimes are going to take place, so they arrest people before the crimes are committed. This leads to a 0 murder rate in DC, and seemingly the world the way we want it. Tom Cruise is the chief officer in charge of this program and he is a borderline burnout who struggles with drugs. That alone, the fact that Tom Cruise plays a burnout, should make it worth seeing this film. With that said, this movie plays like cops and robbers and the action is intense. Cruise is a great main character and the end will leave you guessing. Overall Grade B+<br />Joseph Dworak
B000002BE9|5.0|Tidal is the debut album from Fiona Apple.  With all the talk about the 90 word poem title of her second album and considering how outspoken she is about any subject that comes into her mind, it may be easy to forget her talent.  Apple's music is incredibly good and this is the album that got her noticed with a ton of critical acclaim.  Fiona Apple sounds like nothing else on the radio.  \\"Sleep to Dream\\" was the first single, but it was \\"Criminal\\" that made her popular.<br />Fiona Apple sounds weary through much of this album, like she's been through too much and is tired of dealing.  Even so, there is a melancholic beauty to this piano based music.  \\"Never is a Promise\\" is the song that defines the album.  While most of the songs have Apple singing with a deeper voice, on \\"Never is a Promise\\" she hits higher notes, sounds quite sad, and the song has a haunting beauty.  Not to be missed.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This much hyped DVD/movie was worth the wait. I am not a big fan of Tobey Maguire (what were his parents spelling-names challenged?), but he does a great job in this flick. William Dafoe is the perfect enemy for spiderman, and Kirsten Dunst does a great job of being the flighty romantic lead woman. All in all, they did justice to the Spiderman legend and this was a great work. The special effects displayed in this movie were dazzling and the Computer Generated Images were cutting edge. The sequel, which I am sure they are hot to make another few hundred million dollars on, will be good as well. This movie rates as an A- in my book.<br />Joseph Dworak
B000001ED1|5.0|When Alanis Morissette was cleaning up at the Grammy's with her album Jagged Little Pill, the other top female artist at the time was Joan Osborne with her single \\"One of Us\\".  While \\"One of Us\\" started getting pegged as fluff, I always thought that Osborne's album should have been getting some of those awards Alanis was taking home.  While I thought Relish was the better album, I really wasn't playing it very often and it quickly got lost in the shuffle.  Every so often I pulled the cd out and was surprised by how good it is.<br />It is now back in rotation on my cd player.  If memory serves me, the only singles off this album were \\"One of Us\\" and \\"Right Hand Man\\" (I remember seeing those two performed on Saturday Night Live).  However, favorites of mine also include \\"Lumina\\", \\"Crazy Baby\\", \\"St. Teresa\\", and \\"Ladder\\".  Actually, to be honest, this is a very solid album and while I haven't heard much from Osborne's other albums, this one stands up over time.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator, I have seen it 5 times. Each time I see it, it only gets better. Russell Crowe was the perfect pick for this role, he shines as usual as he effortlessly flows through this role. Although this movie is probably not 100% historically accurate, its principles of leadership &amp; passion are undeniable. People will follow passionate leaders and this movie demonstrates that principle with great clarity. You really cannot go wrong with this DVD in your collection.<br />Joseph Dworak
0061020710|4.0|The Color of Magic is the first of 27 (at the moment) novels set in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. Discworld is a strange world. On one hand, it reminds me of Piers Anthony's Xanth , but Pratchett's tone is more serious and the world is less childish than Xanth . They share the concept of taking ideas from the real world and twisting them into something else. Anthony twists real life things into puns, Pratchett twists them in order to satirize them. Pratchett is much more effective this way as a writer. After reading countless reviews that make mention of Discworld, I finally decided to start the series. I began with the understanding that it is the later books that are best, as Pratchett had not yet hit his stride with the humor. That's fine, I knew what I was coming up against. Sort of.<br />Pratchett doesn't just take aspects of the real world and twist them, he twists much of the rules of conventional fantasy. Everything is a farce, even as he tells a story. At times, I wasn't sure what the plot was, but everything was interesting. During much of the story, I found things mildly amusing, and on several occasions I found something funny. Nothing to compare to what I've heard about later books.<br />The plot follows a failed wizard named Rincewind as he acts as a tour guide for Discworld's first tourist, Twoflower. Twoflower is somewhat of a bumpkin and Rincewind has incredibly bad luck, so along with luggage that follows them around, they end up in predicament after predicament. To attempt to detail the plot out would be folly as it would make no sense to anyone who hasn't yet read a Discworld novel.<br />While not quite as good as I had hoped, it is enough to keep me reading a few more novels in the Discworld to see if things are really as good as everyone seems to say.
B00005JKDR|4.0|While I was skeptical of going to see another mediocre cartoon in theatres, I walked away from this flick really surprised. The animation in Monsters Inc. was great. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are a great on-screen vocal duo of the two main characters. I know my three year old niece loved this movie, and so did I. This movie translates well for DVD and the smaller screen with the sharp sound quality and out-there animation. I don't think this movie will leave you with any dissapointment. I give it a B+.
B00005IC2H|3.0|but a bit too much filler on here for me.  some of the tracks really bring you into a little sigur ros world, others just leave you outside, cold, isolated, unable to connect with whatever your trying to get to.  but, in reference to something a previous reviewer mentioned, the vidrar...luftrasa video.  it is singurlarly the most provoking video ive ever seen.  its 10 minutes of bliss, i was dumbfounded.  u can see it at launch.com if ya go searching.  <br />good album nonetheless.  imo they just need to sharpen up and get some body to most of the tracks.
B00005JM1D|4.0|Old School with Will Farrell, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson is childish, sophmoric, low brow, slap stick, and moronic comedy, and I LOVED every minute of it.<br />For all of the stupid fraternity house comedy, it is also smart, witty, and clever in the way that they tie several story lines together.  There is a cute love story that really works well on screen.<br />In these times of high anxiety, turn off CNN and take a few hours to go and relax, and more importantly, LAUGH with this very funny movie.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I am huge Disney fan, and went into this movie not expecting to enjoy it nearly as much as I would have a Disney film, but my son wanted to see it, so I of course obliged.  I was pleasantly surprised, and had no trouble adding this film to the presents under the Christmas tree.<br />Sherk is a ogre and a loner to the highest degree.  He doesn't believe in fairy tales, and that point is made clear within the first 10 mintues of the film by a very outrageously funny scene in the out house.  Sherk isn't prepared for love, or friendship, but he finds both.<br />This is a film that the whole family can enjoy.  It is laced with adult caliber humor that is easily hidden from the children in your company by making them laugh at the same time due to a facial expression or action placed at the same time as the witty remark.  The ending will not dissapoint the romantics, and for those of you who aren't, don't stop or leave or rewind too soon. You will love Shrek's Kareoke in Swap.
B00000IFP6|5.0|Although I still enjoy Karl Bohm's VPO \\"Pastorale\\" and still have some fond thoughts about Karajan's circa-1962 cycle (although no fond thoughts whatsoever about his two later cycles), by and large I've lost patience for the stately, well-upholstered (or, if you're not feeling charitable, paunchy) Beethoven of many conductors (particularly those of a couple of generations ago). At the same time, I'm not sure the \\"period instruments\\" timbres allow Beethoven's symphonic cycle quite enough heft, so a period-instrument approach on modern instruments seems like a good compromise. This Zinman manages very well. The whole cycle is like a clean blast of air and makes you sit up and take notice as surely as these works' first audiences must have. My only quibbles are a slight lack of oomph in the finale of the Seventh (my favorite among the Beethoven nine) and a certain stinginess in the liner notes when it comes to explaining just what it is about the Barenreiter editions that make them so revelatory.
B00003CX7L|5.0|It is very rare to find a sequel that is just as enjoyable as its predecessor, but this is one of those rare cases.  Since the first film, Buzz and Woody have become the greatest of friends and all in Andy's room has been happy go lucky until the day of the family garage sale.  At the garage sale Andy's ends up inadvertantly putting himself up for sale, and even though Andy's mother finds him and tells a prospective buyer that he isn't a sale item, Andy still ends up going home with a collector believing in five finger disounts.<br />This is a touching story, with some great twists.  The animation is flawless as usual and the enjoyment level, and humor are at any all time high.
B00006F7S4|5.0|With heart-felt lyrics and underwater vocals, Beck delivers depth at the expense of his long-time relationship going awry. This is an album where the master chameleon wears his stylistic acoustics on his sleeve; instant therapy for those who need to purge from pain in the privacy of their own home. <BR>As for those that are dissapointed with this album, Beck belts out only loud enough for those that want to listen.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird deals with the theme of racism in a prejudice society. The main conflict in this book is the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the alleged rape of a Miss. Mayella Ewell a white girl.  The dilemma throught this book is whether or not the fair trial of a black man is possible in the deep South, and if justice truly does prevail. The novel is narrated through the eyes of Scout, a seven year old tomboy who is quickly learning of the existance of prejudice in the society she lives. Her father, Atticus Finch is a well-respected lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson. <br />Aside, from the obvious theme of prejudice the author has also created a mysterious character that is the center of intrigue to the population Maycomb. The purpose of this character, who is Boo Radley, is unknown to the reader and to both Scout and her brother Jem.  They become obsessed with him and won't give up their struggle to discover his true identity, aluckily for the reader they do.  This mysterious character ends up playing a very important role in the outcome of the novel.<br />Regardless of age, this novel will touch people on a personal level.  It will make the reader think and xplore the ramifications of hate and discrimination.  At least this will be the case if there is to remian the hope that racism, predjudice and discrimination will someday be irradicated.  This is a nvael that has a lot to teach if only the reader is willing to listen.
B000071ZZI|4.0|Other than a few bits and pieces, this movie strays badly from Ludlum's artistry.  However, if you've never read the Bourne series, or if you're willing to forget the books, then this is a great little movie.  Matt Damon does a fantastic job playing the part of the amnesia suffering hero, Jason Bourne, who at every turn finds out things about himself that leaves him increasingly aghast - like the book, the movie makes a hero out a character that would be a murderous thug in any other setting.<br />Franka Potente plays the part of the mystified free-spirit who befriends Bourne (enticed initially by some cold-hard-cash), and eventually becomes an enthusiastic confederate.  I suppose it is too much to expect a movie to capture all the intrigue, maneuverings, clandestine subterfuges and treacheries that Ludlum wrote into the books - and it is probably proper that the movie really doesn't try.  It never could capture 10% of the first book in the length of the video - let alone the whole series -- but still this well worth seeing.  I do miss Ludlum's Jackal, but there's still lots of action, good technicals and not too much gratuitous vulgarisms, as well as superb acting.  Good high-drama flick!
0140177396|5.0|&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is certainly a tragedy, and I would certainly not recommend you read the book if you aren't a place where you can cry openly.  Steinberg has written a powerful book that will touch on very sensitive emotions as you follow the character George and Lenny through a short section of their lives together.  The relationship between Lenny and George is related to the reader almost entirely through dilouge, allowing the reader to provide much of their own interpretations.  Their relationship is the basis of the novel, and is only further developed through the use of other, very animated characters.<br />This is not an action packed adventure, or a steamy  romance, or even a suspense filled mystery, but instead a story of a very simply kind of love between very simple characters looking only for a simple existance.
B0000542DJ|5.0|Great DVD, more than six hours of intrigue included in the full package.  Donald Sutherland's character sums up the most essential questions for understanding the events of 11/22/63 and also the events of 9/11/01: why did it happen? who benefitted? and who has the power to cover it up?  Just as the Kennedy assassination was immediately followed by a military adventure into southeast Asia, we now seem unable to stop our runaway war bandwagon leading to Iraq.  And based on what happened in Dallas to JFK, it might not be such a great idea to try.<br />One factual error Stone misses in both the movie and the editor's cut is the purpose of sending Gov. Conally's bloodied suit to the cleaners, which Lyndon Johnson ordered.  The film implies that this was done to destroy evidence.  In fact, Lyndon knew that the Governor's suit -- with a bullet hole in the back of the jacket, one just under the right front lapel, and then a third bullet hole in the left leg -- was Big John's lucky suit.  Compared to what happened to the guy riding behind him, Nov. 22, 1963 was Conally's lucky day all around.
B000069HK2|5.0|THE USED is freakin' awesome!!! They're lead singer has a vioce like no other and every song is a HIT!!!! Let's get the band rockin' the charts because I can't barely explain how much i love their music, I heard their song \\"Taste of Ink\\" and fell in love with their muic, their my number one band on the list and they should be yours too..!
0783226063|5.0|Sorry to all those who are eagerly awaiting the 4 hour version of Dune, but having a copy of both versions I can say without reservation that the theatrical version is vastly superior (and to those who suggest that anyone who says they have the extended version is either lying or they taped it from tv - send me an e-mail and I can provide the production details from the DVD case to you: you can contact the distributor yourself). <BR>I disagree with those who say it strays from Frank Herbert's vision of Dune: it is suitably dark and full of atmosphere. <BR>Yes, it is complex and, being so ambitious, it is at times difficult to understand  - for those not familiar with Dune - but not impossible (and for me it was reason to read the book in the first place). <BR>The production and sound qualities are first rate. If you have a good surround sound system then the DTS sound is sure to impress (or even a good stereo system will do the trick) - to me it is what makes this movie so powerful. <br />The extended version - here in Australia at least - is only in mono sound. In addition it is an &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; production, meaning that David Lynch wanted nothing to do with the butchered end product. It is not, repeat, NOT a Director's Cut, and boy does it show. Stock scenes are used again and again, and very crudely inserted in an attempt to add more detailed story telling. Even the Guild Navigator's voice has been redubbed, and lacks the threatening undertones which make it so ominous in the theatrical release. <BR>The extended version was crudely put together to satisfy a television audience, and relies on an overkill of exposition.<BR>So...if you want a good movie with high quality sound and picture, then buy the theatrical version!!<BR>(PS  the miniseries is equally enjoyable - just a different interpretation of a very complex story. A valid comparison of the two is difficult and ultimately futile: just approach them with an open mind and you should be able to enjoyboth!).
B00000K31Q|5.0|Heath Ledger is gorgeous in this film! Alongside Julia Stiles - one for the guys - they put some chemistry into the film. The best part of this film is where Patrick Verona - played by Heath Ledger - sings &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You&quot; to Kat Stratford - Julia Stiles. This is one of my all-time favourite songs, and it's so sweet! When he sacrifices his reputation for her. This could put people off watching this film, as of the whole Shakespeare link thing, but it's total nonsense. It's a modern story, with only subtle hints about Shakespeare about it, which won't instantly hit you.<br />Heath Ledger is the new ... Mel Gibson? They're both Aussies! Julia Stiles is definitely the new high school sweetheart, and after Kirsten Dunst's crown.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I have struggled to find words for this CD.  I am moving towards 50 and grew up hearing Johnny Cash songs as just another cowboy act.  As my life continues to change with age I look for watermarks that reflect my feelings for what I have experienced.  Music has so often been the language to express those feelings.  Soundbites that briefly exhibit my times, my heart.  I was exposed to this CD by a young man in a music store just off campus when they had recieved an advanced copy and am grateful to have paid attention to this moment.  The voice of Cash, the production work and the song selection are a perfect moment in music history.  I introduced this CD to my children and they were blown away.  The music crosses all boundaries and binds all ages and tastes with its depth and emotion.  Cash takes a powerful song (Hurt) and elevates it to important, a testimony to a life that moves me to tears each time I hear it.  His life weary and haunting takes on Danny Boy, The Man Comes Around, In My Life and I Hung My Head are similarly moving.  The entire CD is a take on life, one of hope, of loss and of sustained faith.  An extraordinary performance from an inspiring individual.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Una pelcula fuera de serie, irreverente, excntrica, inteligente y maravillosa. Con grandes actuaciones y una crtica fina a la educacin equivocada y las &quot;modas&quot; de las nuevas &quot;filosofias&quot; para enfrentar la vida llenas de falsos valores innecesarios. Gran moraleja que nos recomienda no complicarnos demasiado porque al final nos llega la muerte a todos.
B00005JLXC|2.0|This movie is disappointing because it's not exactly bad....& it's not exactly good either.<br />The visuals are great (especially the showing of Daredevil's \\"radar sense\\") & most of the fight scenes.  (I liked the bar fight & the fight in the church, but the shoolyard fight between Matt Murdock & Elektra was just plain ridiculous & corny!) Matt Murdock's character & background were fully developed (though illogically changed from the comic-book original.  He doesn't save a blind man anymore.  He just gets caught in a loading accident.)<br />But everything else about this movie is RUSHED.  Fast-pacing for an action film is necessary, but everything else, from the Kingpin's introduction, to Elektra's relationship with Daredevil (& no, she's NOT a ninja in this movie the way she is in the comic-book, because she doesn't live elong enough to become a paid mercenary!) is just way to quick.<br />If they have a sequel, let's hope they'll get it right the second time around.
B000084T18|5.0|Alright, hold the F@#K UP! I don't know what's up with all the shots being taking at 50 but give credit where credit is due. THE ALBUM IS TIGHT! There wasn't any extra ordinary marketing campaign; face it, like 50 said in his song basically, now that he's down with Dre and Em' he gets love in the club.  Dre has the freaking midus touch, don't hate! Add that to the fact that every track on the album is banging, and that's extremely rare these days, now its easy to see why he sold 900K copies in 4 DAYS! Look is 50 the best lyricists, NO, is he one of the best HELL YEA! Come on now. Every single track, EVERY single track is off the hook! Like the man said, you'll never stop bobbing your head when listening to the album.  If you like hip-hop, you'll love this album. If you can appreciate top-notch beats, you'll love this album! This album is by far the Greatest Album of 2003!  Anyone who hates this album is not a true hip-hop fan and wasn't there in the early days.  Also, the 2 hot singles on air now are by far NOT the hottest tracks on the album, that's what really tripped me out! If you like the singles, you haven't heard nothing yet. Just make sure you have a good sound system!
0151008116|5.0|The selection of Yann Martel's \\"Life Of Pi (LOP)\\" as 2002's Booker Prize is an unusual choice but it comes like a breath of fresh air. It's hard to say what it is. At the most basic level, it is an epic adventure story about an incredible shipwreck and the struggle for survival on the high seas by a motley crew consisting of one human being - our hero Pi - and the most unlikely assortment of animals (from his family's zoo in Pondicherry) you can possibly imagine. Yet it has all the elements of a fable. The simplicity and directness of Martel's language masks the duality and complexity of his insights into the human condition. Are human beings so very different from animals, he seems to ask ? Probably not, as you will conclude watching Pi's relentless bid to outwit and establish supremacy over Richard Parker, the Bengali tiger he's left alone with on the life boat in the Pacific Oceans. Even Pi discovers a few surprises about himself. His courage in the face of adversity is simply awesome and gives faith to us all. Conversely and in a beautifully lyrical passage, Martel tells us that the underwater world of sea creatures - big and small - too has its own traffic system that rivals ours. How's that !<br />LOP also says something about the place of faith and religion in human society. Did it help Pi survive his ordeal ? Ecumenical to a fault - he bows to the gods of Christianity, Islam and Hinduism in random order - he buys insurance from across all religions to cover the risks and by and large succeeds and reaps his rewards. However, Martel's take on religion is perhaps the weakest and least convincing aspect of his novel. He plants the seeds but doesn't water them, so they don't flower. His ideas on religion remain tentative and undeveloped.<br />As if conscious of this lack of closure, Martel engineers a twist at the end of the story that should leave readers scratching their heads in wonder. Have they been taken for a ride ? Should they cry cheat after it is revealed that Pi's account of his adventure on the high seas may be less than reliable ? I don't really know. But read the ending carefully. Herein lies Martel's message. I hear him asking \\"Is anything less than true only because it falls outside the realms of belief ?\\"  \\"Does something become more true only because it is witnessed and corroborated ?\\" <br />But let's not get too intellectual pondering these questions. Read \\"Life Of Pi\\" any way you like. Just remember to enjoy it. \\"Life Of Pi\\" is a treasure that will appeal to readers young and old. An absolutely delightful novel. Unique.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Since George Lucas seems intent on waiting until completing his current trilogy of prequels before issuing the original &quot;holy trilogy&quot; on DVD, unless you own a LaserDisc player, this is the best Star Wars you can get.  The box set includes on VHS each of the first three films--Star Wars, Empire, and Jedi--in the Special Edition versions re-released in theaters for the twentieth anniversary of this cultural phenomenon.<br />Like or hate the updated effects and footage of the Special Edition films, the cleaned-up video and sound quality resultant from the restoration of the original prints are a necessity for the true Star Wars fan.  Older versions of the films watched side-by-side pale in comparison, and televised, pan &amp; scan versions cannot compare to the theatrical widescreen presentation.  Simply watch for the Sand People scene in Star Wars when Luke says, &quot;I can see one of them now,&quot; to see WHY films should always be presented in their original aspect ratios!<br />Finally, what true Star Wars fanatic can be without even a single edition of the films?  If you sleep on Jedi sheets, named your dog Boba Fett, or have a life-size cutout of Han Solo, these videos are required inventory for your collection!
B00007L4OM|5.0|rented it yesterday.............ordered it today
B00005JLRR|3.0|Although this movie did have some good aspects and a few good scenes, it was obviously just an attempt to just get one last next generation movie out there.  Crusher and La Forge are blatantly overlooked, which is insulting, considering both LeVar Burton and Gates McFadden are both wonderful actors and it would have been great to see more of them.  The plot was fairly weak, especially the addition of Data's \\"brother\\", which seemed totally unnecessary, even though they tried to connect it to the plot.  The special effects and music are awesome, though, and as an avid Janeway fan, I must say I enjoyed Kate Mulgrew's acting talents, even if I wasn't (and still am not) sure that I wanted her away from the captain's chair.<br />I'd have to say its a fun movie to watch once or twice, but it's not something you want to see repeatedly.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan, and I certainly didn't think he could pull off an action role, but I was wrong.  &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is a fun movie loaded with great action sequences and scenery (the farmhouse scene in particular).  Franka Potente was absolutely wonderful as Damon's female sidekick.  Hope to see more of her.
B00005JLXC|5.0|Growing up and collecting comics Daredevil was my favorite.  I don't know what it was about him, but I liked him the best.  To see the comic come to life on the screen is a great thing!  The movie does stay true to the comic.  Same dark style.  I enjoyed this movie very much!
6305537798|5.0|This was a really good movie. Me and my brother watched it 7 times after we first saw it. It is really funny, and of course Heath Ledger is so hot!! lol you should see this.. that is, if you're not sick of teen movies already!!
B00007K08H|4.0|I don't think an artwork, whether a movie, a book or a theater play can change a man's life; it can change your mood for a few minutes, at least, and/or it can make you reflect about many things in your life, at most. \\"Le fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain\\" is one of those movies that can make you laugh, feel good and reflect about how many little and seemingly unimportant things can change your life or at least the way you see it. This is such an uplifting and heartwarming piece of art that it makes you want to get out of your appartment and go talk to your next door neighbour whom you've never said hello to.<br /><br />Luckily enough, the director has no pretention for his movie to be very deep; it's about redemption, about trying to find a reason to live and enjoy your life, even when it doesn't appear to make sense to you.  Although it tends to flag a little towards the end, despite a somewhat sensory overload and the fact that there's whimsy to be had just about everywhere (hey, it's a french movie!), the voiceover brilliantly summarizing most of Am&eacute;lie's life, the giddy accordion strains, the beautiful colors, the rare but breathtaking landscapes of the whimsy magic town, the fabulous performance offered by Audrey Tautou make of Am&eacute;lie a wonderful film.

B00006LFGD|5.0|this is a FAB album! Trust me, I'm a BARBRA pro!! A beautiful collaboration of songs, from the old standards, to her two NEW songs with Barry Manilow and the new and GORGEOUS voice Josh Groban! These two songs are heart warming, and I think the Streisand fans will LOVE them!! To all who are contemplating buying this album.. DO SO!! You WON'T regret it! This album is still fairly new, and already been certified Gold!!<BR>GO BABS!!! Thanx for a GREAT album!<BR>Barbra, Sydney Australia.
B0000041Z5|5.0|While I'm not very fond of Solti doing Mahler (escept for #8, wow) he really pulls every detail out of the masterful Brahms symphonies. The Chicago Symphony is wonderful and the sound for a 30 year year old recording is phenomenal. I'm not going to draw out this review as you can clearly see by the rest of the reviews that this is a marvelous set and to sell it for only 30 bucks seems criminal. Buy it. Now. I'm serious.
B000003TA4|5.0|What is there to say about Nirvana's now classic Nevermind? Almost 13 years after it originally came out, it's still going strong taking more space in your local CD store than the new releases of many other bands.<br />If you're reading this and thinking of getting into Nirvana yourself, then don't listen to what the naysayers are saying. The truth is that seemingly many of them have only the slightest clue of what they're thinking about. Cobain's death or otherwise, anything that's stayed this good for more than a decade must have something to it.<br />Many of these people's arguements just show how uninformed or illogical they are. Cobain has a harsh voice? Since when did you have to be a quire boy to do rock and roll? I know of a fellow named Bob Dylan who's not exactly the best singer in the world. And since when was Nevermind full of obsceneties? Last time I checked it had 5 at most, and the only one that was clear was when Cobain claims, \\"nature is a whore\\" on \\"In Bloom\\".<br />And what about the meanings of these songs? At first glimpse, Nevermind's lyrics seem to make no sense at all? Mosquitos? You gotta be kidding me!<br />But if one would take a little time and think a little differently about what Cobain was trying to say, they'd find that Cobain often used complex metaphors in Nirvana's songs.<br />Either way, whether you're more inclined to believe the critics or the supporters, Nevermind changed the face of rock & roll for better or for worse and was a monumental album that should be in anybody's cd case of \\"essentials\\".<br />When you first push the play button, in a matter of seconds you'll hear the now classic introduction to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", right before the instruments all-together explode. Soon after, the storm of the introduction calms and Cobain's voice comes through. \\"Load up on guns and bring your friends, it's fun to lose and to pretend\\" he states as he starts up the song that is to attack the apathy of his own generation through adouble metaphor of going to a party. And soon afer that, the memorable chorus comes up. \\"I feel stupid, and contagious\\" and \\"A mosquito, my libido\\", the perplexing words are actually references to STD's and the early 90's careless attitude towards them.<br />This continues for about 5 minutes by which time you'll be suree to be screaming alongside Cobain as he shouts \\"a denial!\\" several times in reference to the chorus to end the song.<br />But no time to rest. Up comes \\"In Bloom\\", Nirvana's message to all those who claim to be fans of their music because it's the cool thing to do, but don't understand any of it. This is one of many of Cobain's attacks on the stereotypical \\"macho man\\".<br />The other big song, \\"come as you are\\" comes next, as Cobain sings of numerous contradictions, and our mindset of wanting to change things for the better, but not acting out our thoughts.<br />In bloom is the worst out of the big 5, but it's still great compared to the rest of the garbage that was popular before Nevermind. However, you might be tempted to skip the track in order to get to what many consider the real highlight of the album.<br />\\"Lithium\\" is an amazing song about going insane with great lyrics, and a simply fantastic chorus. Clocking in at about 4 minutes, you'll have plenty time to enjoy it.<br />The next track, Polly, is one of those songs you can't really appreciate until you know the story behind it. In 1991, a 14-year-old girl was kidnapped, raped, and killed in the Seattle area. Polly, is Cobain's metaphor for the girl. A very sad song with a great acoustic guitar, once you understand it it will become one of the highlight tracks on Nevermind.<br />Territorial Pissings is the most punk-like of all the tracks here. As one reviewer said, 'classic punk melt-down', about as fast and heavy as punk will get.<br />Drain You is Nevermind's great Love Song. With a great opening (One baby said to another, I'm lucky to have met you), the only complaint I have about it is the highly medical secondary theme that might confuse those trying to figure out what Cobain's talking about.<br />Lounge-Act, is a great, and I believe, very under-rated song about ego-maniacs.<br />Stay Away, is as the title suggests a song about getting away, <BR>but once doing so, regretting it.<br />On A Plain might be the worst song on the CD but it's still very good. No real theme but a number of nice quotes. Sort of like a closing to the main part of the album.<br />Nevermind finally closes up with Something In The Way, a song about 3-year-old Cobain running away from his parents and hiding under a bridge. A very slow song that some feel goes on for too long, one can argue that it's appropriate for a song ending a relatively fast album otherwise.<br />So there you go. If you already have it, good for you. If not, go get it as soon as possible. This is an essential for any fan of modern rock. These guys in some way inspired many of these current-day bands, including \\"The Vines\\" among others.<br />Check it out. Chances are 99/100 that you'll love it too.
B000088E6M|4.0|Nothing groundbreaking or greatly original but 50's deffinitely got flow and he's real catchy. The album boasts great production and has 2 notable features from Eminem and also features Nate Dogg and the GGGGG-Unit. Most the tracks are real street and gutter and 50 seems to have the credibility to go along with what he's saying. If you don't go into it with super high expectations you'll enjoy and it's worth the purchase.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah has beautiful, soft voice that will help you forget your troubles.  If you like piano and soft mellow music then Norah Jones &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; is what you should have in your CD player.  The more I play this CD the better I like it.  She is a great talent - I can't wait to hear more from Norah Jones!
B0000024LN|5.0|One of my very favorite hip-hop albums of all time and in my opinion Redman's best. Banging from begining to end. Reggie Noble hits us with 17 brick city punches and 3 humorous skits. Features Method Man on Do What Ya Feel Redmans's brother K-Solo on It's like that and fellow Def Squad Members Erick Sermon on Whateva Man and Keith Murray on Da Ill Out. If you don't already own this album go cop it and I gurantee your ears will be locked like you swallowed the key.
B00004YC2F|4.0|I bought this after hearing the rave reviews and have to admit that I'm a little disappointed. The performance is very exciting and his playing is sensational throughout. However, if you're looking for a sensitive and lyrical account of the slower, more beautiful and melancholic moments, they're sadly absent, even more so than in  Lang Lang's recent recording. But this is nonetheless a tauter recording than the latter's. Kissin tried to avoid this kind of showy approach, but despite elegantly slower tempi, did not quite come across convincingly. And Berezovsky ruined his early recording by playing the last movement with cuts.<br />Volodos plays the larger cadenza, which I love. I disagree with Horowitz's view that it unbalances the piece. It is really an integral part of the recapitulation which the short cadenza fails to satisfy as such. The playing itself is virtuosic rather than profound.<br />As a whole, the profound sadness of this concerto is glossed over for its more brilliant side, in this recording. I've not heard the definitive performances yet of this work (trying to get the Gavrilov and the Weissenberg). But the closest I know are the Horowitz and Argerich (both playing the short cadenza)on one hand, and Ashkenazy's on the other if you like to dwell on the more introspective side of the work. Of course there's always Rachmaninov's vintage performance albeit with the short cadenza to allow him to fit it into the old 78 rpms, if you can tolerate the sound quality. But you might still like Volodos, like the others below! It really depends on your taste.
B00000K0DV|3.0|i have seen several Fulci movies and have been shocked by something in each one.  In \\"The New York Ripper,\\" i was somewhat disappointed.  Part of it, i think, is that i saw it took place in New York City, and was expecting New York actors and well written English dialogue, instead of the poor dubbing that is associated with his movies.  That was probably my fault for expecting that from an Italian director.  However, that aside, i found the murder and gore to be sub-par compared to the things i've seen in \\"Zombie,\\" \\"City of the Living Dead,\\" and even the apparently horribly butchered version of \\"The Beyond\\" i own entitled \\"Seven Doors of Death.\\"  With this movie, what i was really hoping to find was a gritty, more reality-based Fulci movie with the same brutal viciousness and gore offered by his other more supernatural-themed movies.  However, what it lacked in gore it more than made up for with blatant misogyny, which was ever-present and strong throughout this movie, ensuring to stroke the woman-hater in all of us. (What, \\"there's no woman-hater in [you],\\" you say?   Right, and michael jackson only had two nose jobs.)  i guess Fulci was trying to focus more on sexual excess and perversion that can sometimes be a prominent aspect of human nature,  than on the excessive gore that typified his movies in this one, but it just didn't really seem to work very well.  <br />Overall, the characters are as shallow as in any of his movies, the plot is somewhat hackneyed, and the gore is not nearly what i had come to expect from a Lucio Fulci movie.  However, it did have its moments, such as the razor blade bisecting the nipple, and is definitely worth the watch and probably the purchase too, especially for the Fulci fan, as well as any other disturbed individuals who enjoy gorging themselves on violence and the humiliation and degradation of other people, namely women (not that i condone that sort of thing.)
B00005JLEU|5.0|Not only was this film very amusing, it was beautifully animated with backgrounds often reminiscent of impressionist paintings.
B00005RFVL|4.0|You wouldn't think of Robbie to be one to do a Swing album, but really his voice suits it quite well.  A number of piano-driven and big band swingin tracks fill up this cd, and check out the liner notes they have the cutest little anecdotal stories in there.  Taking cues from Sinatra, Bobby Darin, and Sammy Davis you get a real feeling that your in a jazz club.<br />The album starts with an original orchestral song called &quot;I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen&quot;.  Not the best song and it differs from the rest in that you can tell it was written in modern times (Cameron Diaz and Spielberg are big hints).  It then goes on to the classic track &quot;Mack The Knife&quot; also not my fave track but it sets the tone for the rest of the cd so I can see why its there.<BR>After that is the Nicole Kidman duet of a Frank and Nancy Sinatra song where they both sing all the words in perfect harmony the whole way through.  Catchy and the spanish guitar gives it a unique twist.  &quot;Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me&quot; is a very very swing club track that makes me think of old movies from the 40's, a pretty good track and Robbie does it justice.<br />After that you move onto the sub-duet with Frank Sinatra himself(It was a very good year) where by the wonders of modern technology, the two sing on the same track, but never at the same time.  The orchestra bits are very well done, and its sung with a nice realistic reminiscent tone.  Then we have the very very fun and catchy track &quot;Straighten Up And Fly Right&quot; about a Monkey and a Buzzard.  To continue the fun theme they jump into &quot;Well Did Ya Evah?&quot; A duet with comedian Jon Lovitz.  This funny song is a convo. between two ppls at a party where they gossip but play it off with teh lines &quot;What a swell party this is&quot;<br />We then move into a serious set of two songs, Mr.Bojangles, a very classy jazz piece about the famous tap dancer of the 30's with a nice guitar background.  Then there is One For My Baby, the ultimate in late night lounge tracks I love this one, since its just piano and singing.  Then it moves onto a fun track, Things, another female duet with a British actress.  After that is &quot;Aint That A Kick In The Head&quot; another basic swing track like &quot;Mack The Knife&quot; for example.<br />The last few songs of the album in my opinion are the best.  My fave fave track is &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me&quot; A duet with a famous broadway star, which just has a lovely melody and cute words.  The inspiration for the album is next, &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones&quot; and promises a big classic booming swing track.  Then we have &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot; a cute duet with Robbie and his 'roomie' that talks about the relationship between best buds, a real rat pack track.  Finally we end with &quot;Somewhere Beyond The Sea&quot; A nice chilled farewell track but not my fave.  If you stick around for half an hour after all this, or just scan through it, you can catch outtakes and such from the recording sessions.

B00007G207|5.0|I became aware of the existence of over 50 minutes of additional scenes in this film in the past two years. The original, pruned version received the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1990. I have owned the video for a decade. Then, last summer, the \\"new version\\" was shown in limited release, and a DVD was promised. With the addition of the deleted scenes, an entirely different film is created. Owning this DVD is owning a brand new version of the film's events.<br />Initially, the film was considered too long, and massive scenes were cut, removing any and all references to whatever happened to Salvatore's great love, Lina. The original version of the film focused mainly on the young boy, fatherless in post-WWII Sicily, bonding with the childless cinema projectionist, Alfredo. The young Toto grows into the teen-aged Salvatore, who falls in love with the beautiful and unattainable Lina. They are parted. That is the last we see. Salvatore returns to his village many years later to attend the funeral of Alfredo, and the film is told nearly entirely in flashback.<br />In this version, Salvatore is reunited with his lost love when he returns for the funeral. To think that this entire plot was removed from the film initially is almost unthinkable. There are other parts of the film that could have been edited to keep these additional scenes in. I don't know what the producers, directors or the studio were thinking when they edited a huge part of the movie out.<br />Well, now the film is complete. Whereas the original version focused mainly on the relationship of Toto and Alfredo, we now see a conclusion to Toto and Lina as well. And, we understand the ending of the film in an entirely, much less sentimental light. Salvatore has spent the bulk of his life mourning his lost love, not returning to his village, and not knowing of Alfredo's hand in the matter. He is facing life-changing decisions, and must ultimately dip into a pool of acceptance and forgiveness. Without the addition of these scenes, the point is lost.<br />This was an excellent film to begin with, now it is nearly perfect. It is bittersweet and touching, and all the more realistic with the deleted scenes returned. If you own the original version, you must own this version. You will see this film in a completely different light.ithout the addition of these scenes, the point is lost.<br />This was an excellent film to begin with, now it is nearly perfect.

B00004T8RK|5.0|I love Pearl Jam. I honestly can't say I love any rock bands that are around today. Can one even find coherent album based-not singles based albums-today? I think of perhaps The Strokes, who stand out, yet would have been just another punk rock band in the late 70's; like maybe Black Flag.<br />But Pearl Jam still amazes me. My favorite album was No Code (I never liked Ten), and it seems the more unpopular their albums are, the more I love them. They're not just poseurs who fight the system (I used to think that, back in the Ticketmaster duel). They are bonafide alternative musicians.<br />I find that the albums I dislike the most on first listen, are the ones I end up listening to for years (like No Code, again). This album feels like a sequel to No Code. There are no hits. It's just a complete statement.<br />I won't point out the songs since I don't even know the titles, nor do I care. I turn it on, sit back, and listen to the whole thing. The only song that annoys me is Breakerfall; and since it's first, it's easy to skip.<br />So I love this. And I love that others don't love it. I guess it's what separates the true fans from those who long for a return to \\"Jeremy\\", and their earlier catchy immature stuff. I guess this is for true fans only; but also for anyone who will listen to an album repeatedly without dissing it and throwing it under all their other CDs.
B000001FMC|5.0|I've just put this into my CD player again after not having listened to it for a couple of months and it still sounds as fresh as ever! Brilliant production, uplifting and catchy tunes and beautiful vocals. If these songs don't cheer you up, nothing probably will! I've never heard of them again after this release, got no clue why. This CD will remain one of my favorites!
B0000025T6|5.0|This is an excellent piece of music--please don't get me wrong.  I will be sure to sing its praises insofar as I am able.  First off, though, I must preface this review with a warning.  If you are new to Bruce Springsteen and you think you like his music, you need to stick with the more mainstream material for a while.  You're not going to warm up to this one quickly.  You may not ever make it.<br />The reason why you're going to have that difficulty is because there is nothing in this album that relates at all to what makes other music from Bruce Springsteen good.  The E Street Band was excused, so that means no saxophone, no piano, and no gargantuan wall of sound.  Indeed--I think you'll find that you can't even listen to this CD in your car because it occasionally fades so low as to be overwhelmed by the sounds of traffic.  There is no way to even distinguish this as a Springsteen album, were it not for his grating, raspy, loveably awful voice on the tracks.<br />Honestly, it's hard to say what makes this album good.  I've always considered people who believe that any piece of music which sounds like an old drunk playing a kazoo into a tin can were stupid.  I still do.  You should not come to this show for its production values, because it sounds like something your neighbor would record in his garage.  Fortunately, that works here, since Springsteen is the only performer and the sound itself is a lot more akin to that you would expect from a performance by a single person.<br />I will confess that I hated this CD the first two times I played it.  It moves slowly, there's little in the way of catchy tunes, and it's so quiet that you really can't do anything other than sit like a lump and listen to it.  Over time, however, it has grown on me, mostly because of the brilliant execution of theme (harder to define in this one than his previous albums, but justice and the law play big roles) and the relatively uncluttered nature of the album.  This is essentially whatyou get when you put Bruce Springsteen into a pressure cooker and sweat him down to a guitar and a harmonica, and there's a lot to like there (unlike Tom Joad, which pales in comparison to this effort).  While I do think the disc gets slow at points, I still can't think of any fundamental flaw with it, and so it gets my somewhat unconditional recommendation.  Just don't expect it to sound like Born in the U.S.A.
B000000WJZ|5.0|After causing a stir with their debut &quot;Gish&quot;, The Smashing Pumpkins topped that excellent debut with &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;; an album that is everything the definition of incredible stands for.  Every song on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; is truly something, and as corny as that might sound, any fan of the band or anyone who has listened to the album will tell you that a truer word has never been spoken.  The rocking open &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, along with the hypnotic &quot;Today&quot;, and the mournful yet amazing &quot;Disarm&quot; would all become rock radio staples are still heard in abundance today.  &quot;Mayonaise&quot;, &quot;Quiet&quot;, &quot;Geek USA&quot;, and &quot;Soma&quot; are some of the best songs I have ever heard and all really set the album apart from many of the alternative bands clogging the airwaves at the time, and helped propel The Smashing Pumpkins to worldwide fame.  All this would be topped however, by the unforgettable landmark &quot;Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness&quot;, both of which are essential landmark albums that it is a true sin not to own no matter what kind of music you listen to.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I love this cd! I mean, IT ROCKS! System of a Down has always been my favorite band since I bought their first self titled album. It was good, heavy stuff. I then bought Toxcicity. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!! All the songs sounded the same and it wasn't that heavy. Don't get me wrong, I liked the album, It didn't just give up to their normal standards.<BR>I thought that STEAL THIS ALBUM would be just like TOXICITY. I was wrong!! This cd has some very thought out, powerful lyrics with melodic beats and thrashing music. Any fan of SOAD will make this cd a must own! Go now, BUY IT!!!
B00005YW4H|2.0|Alright. Honestly. I think Norah Jones is overrated.<br />I don't think she should have won album of the year, and I am not itching to see her in live in concert.<br />Don't get me wrong, I think she is a great artist and she has good music, but there are LOTS of other artists that I'd rather listen to than Norah Jones. I also am a jazz afficianado. I have her album and at first I was pretty impressed. Don't Know Why is a great song and she has a classic voice but her album sounds ALL THE SAME - her sultry voice and her soothing piano can't really hold my attention for longer than 4 songs max.<br />How about some rockin jazz Norah? How bout you show what you an REALLY do with that piano? Jazz is not entirely mellow and soothing. How 'bout you break it down for me? I like artists who can sound more than ONE sound, who can be versatile and reinvent themselves in ONE album. Honestly, she doesn't do that at all. She just sounds like Norah Jones - sultry jazz singer. <br />She doesn't bring anything new to the table. She doesn't really have a sound that grabs you and makes you say \\"Oh stuff, WTF was that? I want to hear more.\\" When I hear her music, I feel like I've heard it before, it doesnt impress me. Hearing her music makes me want to go back and find her influences, find the originators of jazz singers. <br />I'd rather listen to Ella Fitzgerald. <br />I dont think she should have won Best New Artist, maybe Best Femal Vocal Performance for Don't Know Why because it is a great song..but not best NEW artist. <br />Norah Jones is nothing new.
B001CC7PKS|3.0|If you must have a copy of this movie, then this is the version to get.  It takes a weak movie and makes it much better.  Ben Affleck is a decent  actor, but he is not a good fit for this part.  His voice, mannerisms, and acting style scream romantic comedy not tortured dark super hero.  It's a bad match.  I consider the original film pretty bad, but the new scenes really make a difference.  I don't want to spoil anything, but there's a scene with the Kingpin that is much better in this version.  One thing that you just can't escape though, is the producer's obsession with unmasking Daredevil to basically everyone.  It's like some movie writers just can't grasp the idea of a secret identity.  More of it probably has to do with making sure the main actor's face isn't covered with a mask as much as possible.  Makes no sense to me, but whatever.  This movie would definitely get another star if they could remove one of the worst fight scenes I have ever witnessed.  Yes, the blind lawyer fighting with an expert martial artist in plain view of many witnesses.  Yeah, what better way to protect your identity than by giving a very public martial arts demonstration.  What moron signed off on that scene?  Still, if you have the original version, dump it and get this one.
B000068TPN|2.0|They compare this movie a lot to Braveheart because it was written by the same guy and stars Mel Gibson.  Well, in my opinion this movie was no where near close to Braveheart.<br />Mel Gibson's acting is decent but I dont' think he'll ever do better than Braveheart.  The Patriot was better than this movie if you want another Mel Gibson war movie.<br />If you want another war movie from the 20th century, check out Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers.  Also, Platoon kicks this movie's butt as far as Vietnam movies go.<br />Overall this movie was too drawn out.  The action was great, was very random and long.  The beginning seemed like it took forever.  I got really sick of Mel Gibson talking about God and never leaving his soldiers.  It just seemed cheesy and out of place.<br />There are better war movies out there, so try something else.  If you want some pretty decent action and blood and guts and gore, check this one out.  I suggest renting it though.
B000001E29|5.0|I think it's Based on Weber's 'Der Freishutz' but I could be mistaken, the idea for it may be a common theme. A Bit like Faust in that he sells his soul and comes out poorly in his dealing with the devil. You also get to hear the Late William S Burroughs sing! The track \\"Just the Right Bullets\\" might be my favorite, but they are uniformly good, I don't find myself clicking through tracks on it. Tom Waits uses different voices through it, it's a good recording, I think you should buy it. I just want you to be happy, that's my only little wish.
0792844882|3.0|The story of the movie is not bad saying that two women are some how fighting for 'fame' in the show. One of the woman is having sex in the personal swimming pool with the guy that is what is in the script for I think is the purpose of fame. The movie makes a good laugh out of it in terms of sex being protrayed in these movies as it tells people that sex is good for adventure, very good and encourages people to try. It makes a good day.
0676973779|3.0|I enjoyed this book it was a fun read.  I read in three days. I couldn't put it down but at the same time there were scenes that I found gorry.  I would definitely recommend reading this book, and I would read more books by this author again.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle may be Kurt Vonnegut's best book, and John -- the main character who is not mentioned by name beyond the first page of the book -- may be a bit like Vonnegut himself, a man swept up by events, an involuntary protagonist.<br />Vonnegut's characters, as always, are eclectic, unusual and extremely funny. The general subject matter is at once irreverent and relevant to the world we are in today, and the insight into human nature is timeless.<br />Without giving away the story, the end of the book is biblical, one way or another. I see it as apocalyptic, which is an easy interpretation, but a friend sees similarities with the Great Flood, a cleansing event. Now I wonder if the first and last books of the Bible have more in common than I first thought. Thanks, Kurt, John, Ice-9.<br />For those who don't know much about Vonnegut himself, the man never meant to become one of the leading writers of his generation. He was a short story writer in the 1940s and 1950s, when that was still a viable profession, and he turned to novels reluctantly. According to his biographies and interviews he's given, he saw himself as a simple story teller, a catalyst for readers to live in a different reality for a few pages, to chuckle a little on the bus home. But his longevity, the importance of the then-contemporary issues he has written about and the impact he had on generations of young people (who later became middle aged and then old people while remaining influenced by the writer from Indianapolis) have solidified Vonnegut's place in the American literary canon, and Cat's Cradle is the best example of his work.<br />Enjoy.
0312305060|2.0|I was disappointed in the book, I didn't feel there was enough story in this book.  I think there were too many characters in the book to gain a true understanding of the characters.  The book felt like it was written for the movies.
B000069AUI|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal album. I could listen to this disc for hours and not grow tired of it. A little edgier than Parachutes, but still just as great. Scientist is one of my favorite songs ever-- absolute must own.
0452282152|4.0|I enjoy reading books that have a historical context to them and bring you into the worlds of the past.  I enjoyed the way a painting by Vemeer was interpreted to create such an intricate story.  One of the best reads of 2002.
B000000W6F|5.0|I don't think any band's first album has ever been as good as the Pumpkin's debut.  Already with many of the trademarks in place that would elevate them into rock valhalla with Siamese Dream, Corgan, Iha, D'Arcy, and Chamberlain create a wonderful mutation of garage rock and the burgeoning grunge scene.  Corgan's vocals on this album are surprisingly gritty and caustic, as his psychedelia-tinged lyrics create the canvas on which ringing, sputtering guitars and thundering precussion leave their mark.  The songs are inspired genius, one after another, and though borrowing from much of rocks past take enough left turns to keep the listener enthralled.  &quot;I Am One&quot; leads off the record perfectly with apocalyptic bombast.  &quot;Siva&quot; takes that one step further with perfect loud-soft dynamics that would become the Pumpkin's trademark.  The lyrics convey a shadowy, understated sense of doom while sounding ephermeral at the same time, especially prevalent in &quot;Rhinoceros,&quot; an almost otherworldly epic with perfectly timed melodies thorughout.  Devotion, loss, and perseverance also surface, like in &quot;Suffer&quot; where the protagonist searches for an ambiguous sort of salvation while at the same time seeing its &quot;too late to discover piece of mind, too late to recover.&quot;  The overall message, however simple, is elegantly stated and perfectly complemented by the loud but tuneful music:  Hope prevails above all.  This is especially evident in the second to last song &quot;Windowpane,&quot; which builds to a crescendo of guitar crunch as Corgan intones &quot;Do what you've got to do/And say what you've got to say/Start today.&quot;  The Pumpkins always had a sense of hope and perseverance at their core, and with their best music it was powerfully conveyed.  Essential, along with Siamese Dream.
B00005JL78|5.0|This movie has it all...special effects, action, drama, thriller, who done it, suspense and futuristic scenery and ideas. There's probably more, but I just couldn't think of 'em all right now. GREAT MOVIE!
B00005JLXC|4.0|\\"Daredevil\\" is an excellent action movie circling around the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who was left blind as a child when radioactive waste sloped over his eyes - but the same waste which took his eyesight granted him superhuman sharpness - and all his other senses are haywire. He eventually learns to adapt to his new gift, by \\"kung-fooing\\" and learning to defend himself with the use of his other senses. As an adult, he's a successful lawyer in the small neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, by night, he's the dark, aerobatic vigilant known as Daredevil, who silently brings justice to the streets of New York. He meets and falls in with love with the lovely martial arts master Elektra Natchios (Excellently portrayed by the very talented Jennifer Garner) - who thinks not so highly about Daredevil after she comes to think that he killed her father - when it was really the assassin-for-hire Bullseye (A wonderful performance by Colin Farrell), who was sent by the evil Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan, who, unfortunately, is badly cast), who has also sent other people to be murdered. Once Daredevil finds out that Kingpin is the culprit, he must face him and Bullseye in a final showdown - in an attempt to complete his vow of bringing justice to his city. <br />Personally, I enjoyed \\"Daredevil\\" a lot - and I was quite surprised because I really expected it to be like \\"The Phantom\\" with Billy Zane - a flop and a cheap imitation of \\"Spider-Man\\". And it wasn't like that at all! I also didn't have much anticipation for Ben Affleck's performance, and it wasn't bad - it was actually very good and he had a lot of physical potential. Oh - and I loved Jennifer Garner. She was a great leading lady. She's definitely bringing on the girl power to the movie. Colin Farrell was so good, I think he stole the show. He was evil. Pure evil. Though I can't say much of Michael Clark Duncan, it really looked as if he wasn't really enjoying the role. He didn't sound or even look evil. The special effects were a teensy-weensy too fake for my taste, but they were fine. I also think that they should've laid off the rock music. It was just annoying to hear people talk and hearing some rock band singing in the background when there isn't even a radio in the scene. This movie was not for that type of scenario. The story and directing were great! It was orginial, on track and very darn good- - bravo for Mr. Johnson. <br />In conclusion, \\"Daredevil\\" is yet another great adoption of a comic book. Though I enjoyed \\"Spider-Man\\" more than this one, it certainly is your time's worth.
0064407667|5.0|It is no doubt a great wrong to take such pleasure in reading about the misery of the three Beaudelaire orphans in \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" the first book in A Series of Unfortunate Events, but that seems a natural reaction to this tale by Lemony Snicket. Violet is fourteen with a real knack for inventing and building strange devices; Klaus is twelve and very well read; and Sunny is a mere infant who likes to bite and to exclaim single words with great depths of meaning. But none of that seems to matter when their house burns down along with their parents while they are enjoying a day at the beach. The law dictates that the three children be raised by their relative, which turns out to the odious--the word \\"odious\\" here means \\"deservedly hateful\\"--Count Olaf who supplies them with a single bed and cold porridge for breakfast. While the Baudelaire siblings dream of a better life, Olaf saddles them with a multitude of chores and plots to steal their family fortune. From a bad beginning, things just continue to get worse for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny.<br />Young readers of A Series of Unfortunate Events can prosper--the word \\"prosper\\" here means \\"benefit\\"--from paying attention to the details of the story. There are slight glimmers of hope in the story, although they never last long, and you can anticipate their brief appearances in the narrative if you read carefully. They will also expand their vocabulary because in telling the depressing story of the Baudelaire orphans author Lemony Snicket tends to use unfamiliar words; granted, he explains what they means, just as he translates Sunny's inarticulate outbursts. Young readers might be depressed and despondent-the word \\"despondent\\" means \\"depressed\\"-when they have finished reading \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" but they will have learned some new words to help express their despondency.<br />The only complaint that one (or more) can have about \\"The Bad Beginning\\" is that it is relatively short. But then, to be fair, there is only so much about disaster lurking around every corner that a young reader can bear. True, the story comes with a strong warning that it lacks a happy ending, beginning or middle, but there is something to be said for discovering that somebody else's lot in live is worse than your own. A gentleman by the name of Brett Haelquist has been hired to provide illustrations that provide a sense of the despair without actually showing you the evil face of Count Olaf or the man with the hook. There is a handsome cover picture and the book is hardbound, as befits a tragedy of this sort. Against all common sense I have a flicker of hope in my chest for the poor Baudelaire orphans as I procede to the second book, \\"The Reptile Room,\\" but I fear the worst.o much about disaster lurking around every corner that a young reader can bear.

B0000028M7|5.0|This is not only Alice's best album but the best album ever released by one band.  Every song is well thought out and very well played.  The harmonization between Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell will continue to be imitated but never duplicated. No other musicians have ever been able to fuse such a complicated and unique style and also a kind of &quot;I wish i would have thought of that&quot; simplicity.  From the hits that almost everyone has heard like &quot;Rooster&quot;, and &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, to the songs that could've easily been number one hits had they been released, like &quot;Junkhead.&quot;  Alice in Chains helped to birth the revolutionary grunge style.  They were pioneers that helped to bring about some of the most talented bands today.  This album captures them in their prime.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is nasty. Every time you watch it you get into it and it is just insane.
B0000635NG|5.0|Norah jones has the greatest voice ever.  she is so awesome! I reccommend this for anyone who can appreciate great voices and also a mellowed out tune.  This Album really chills you out if your having a bad day.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is absolutly insane. Nasty fight seens cool even after watching it 100 times
B00006RU5B|5.0|I've not enjoyed an album as much as this in 15-years.  Near flawless.
B00006LIRI|4.0|While I don't think that the reviews in this forum on U2's latest greatest hits album have been overwhelmingly negative or that they have dismissed as unacceptable U2's offering for this past decade, I don't hear the praise and appreciation from anyone here that I would expect of a loyal and patriotic(if you will) U2 fan.<br />I have been a fan of U2 ever since their Joshua Tree album and have learned to appreciate the band's music prior thereto and afterwards as well.  I listen to U2 because I like what they DO offer; not because of what they don't.  With this new greatest hits album, the band has put together a compilation of songs that they want you to reflect upon as the style of music that they believe best represents what sound or style of music they have tried to produce during this past decade.<br />I feel that since we don't know the members of U2 personally, a good way to understand more about their personality and creative genious is to listen to the tracks that are included in their album and reflect upon it for a few moments and analyze it to get a feel for the mood, rhythm and whatever else they use in their songs. Then, make a decision for yourself whether or not U2 is putting its best foot forward or if they are indeed living up to the hype that has surrounded them for the majority of their musical existence.  <br />I guess if I had my say in the matter, I would have supplanted some of the songs on the most current greatest hits album for some of my favorites from 1990-2000.<br />But then I suppose that would make it an album of greatest hits compiled by me, NOT by U2.<br />In closing, I freely accept any offering that comes from the greatest band in Ireland.  Keep up the good work, U2.
0151008116|4.0|THE LIFE OF PI is, on the surface, a simple story:  Piscine Molitar Patel, the son of an Indian zookeeper, clings to a lifeboat after a cataclysmic shipwreck as his family and part of its zoo emigrate to Canada.  Unfortunately (and also fortunately, as the reader comes to understand), Pi finds that, although he is the only human aboard the lifeboat, he shares his craft with several animals from the zoo, both prey and predator.  Whether he survives this ordeal depends highly on his wits, the meager supplies on board, and his ability to understand the innate behavior of the animals.<br />This is not merely a story of survival at sea; it is an allegory not easily defined.  Martel devotes the first part of his book (roughly 100 pages) to the childhood of Pi as he seeks to understand animal behavior and the world's major religions.  Pi is drawn hungrily to faith and God, worshipping devoutly in the traditions of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam.  When confronted by his three spiritual advisors and told he must choose one religion, he refuses because he finds comfort in them all.  He tells them he just wants to love God, and he quotes Gandhi: \\"All religions are true.\\"  This is the most important key to understanding the significance of Part 2, Pi's story at sea, which comprises the bulk of the book and which is rich in symbolism derived from many religions.  Most of this section is surprisingly riveting despite the mundane facts of survival.  When occasionally the narrative lags, Martel quickly rights it with a new insight or adventure.  The third part of the book is brief and humorous as two Japanese men interview Pi about his ordeal.  Through their skepticism, they force an alternate story from Pi.  While some people have criticized this final section as being tacked onto the book, the pivotal moment is contained here, with the stunning revelation that it doesn't matter which story one believes, as long as the beginning and the end are true.<br />This book can be enjoyed on two levels, the literal and the philosophic.  Martel's writing is engaging and detailed, containing a wealth of knowledge about a variety of topics.  The spirituality here is not heavy-handed but instead gentle and gauzy, brushing up against the narrative without showing its seams.<br />I highly recommend this for a general readership.  Book clubs will find much to discuss and decipher. Avid and casual readers alike will delight in the unusual mix of simplicity and depth contained in this award-winning  novel.oyed on two levels, the literal and the philosophic.

B0000214F0|1.0|I saw Caligula when it was first in theaters.  It was one of those movies that all my friends said we had to see, because it was so controversial.  Controversial it is.  Good it is not.<br />I've heard through the years that Sir John Gilgud did not know that the part he was playing would be in a film showing explicit sexual acts and degredation.  I find this hard to believe, given the producer of the film - it was Penthouse magazine.<br />That said, Caligula is dull, dull, dull.  It is only the scenes of horror and sexual predation that make this film rise above the sublimely mind numbing - and that's really sad.<br />You know you're going to watch it, because you're curious, but just know this: after you watch this repugnant film, if you're anything like me, you'll want to bathe afterward.  It's really a creepy gross film.
B000089CPF|3.0|Feast of Wire comes closest to capturing the excitement and atmosphere of Calexico's live performances than previous releases--meaning it's not quite as dull as Hot Rail or Black Light--and there are a couple of surprises along the way. <br />I commented on another Calixico review that the band may be painting itself into a musical corner, but Feast of Wire contains a lot more variety than we're used to from the band. I don't think they're done yet.<br />Joey Burns sounds more confident at the microphone, although the vocals are still the weakest aspect of this band. Paul Niehaus (Paul Burch, Lambchop) adds some nice steel guitar.<br />This, plus the debut release Spoke, is really all the Calexico you need to hear.
B000084T18|4.0|Well we know dude is rich. I mean dude was one of the biggest drug dealers in the NY. He got 1 mil to sign with Eminem. He has already made about 1 1/2 mil from his independent CD \\"Guess Who's Back\\"(he got 5 dollars for every CD sold and he's sold abt 250,000 copies already) and This CD has sold about 1.8 million copies in a week and a half. So yeah dude is rich. Is the bang to hype ratio right should be the proper question. I'd have to say yes. Listening to this CD to me is like the first time is saw \\"New Jack City\\" or heard the infamous GETO BOYS. It's just unadulterated thugism! Being shot 9 times and havin such a horrible childhood really proves to be a backdrop for this CD. The CD starts with \\"What up Gangsta\\". A cool lil song settin the tone for the rest of the CD. Track 3 \\"Patiently Waiting\\" features Eminem.. They go real hard on this one. Great sound effects on this one. One of the better cuts on the CD. Track 4 \\"Many Men\\" is cool but I was really feelin the lyrics, especially when he talks about dude that shot him. Of course track 5 \\"In Da Club\\" probably will be the club song of the year. I've never heard a song looped so much in the club. They play this song for 10 minutes straight and the club stays hype! Track 6 \\"High All the Time\\" is his tribute to the sticky icky! Good cut. Track 7 \\"Heat\\" is classic Dre production. This song is just raw! A gun cocks in the background on the wholeeeee song. Track 8 is another Dre staple song. Track 9 \\"Blood Hound\\" is a cool song with a nice little chorus. He sounds alot like Bushwick Bill on this one. Track 10 \\"Back down\\" is one of the CD highlights. Dude rips Ja Rule apart!!!! Track 11 \\"P I M P\\" is another banger. Track 12 \\"Like My Style\\" features his crew G UNIT. My  2nd favorite cut on the CD is track 14 \\"21 Questions\\". It's a Dre production with Nate Dogg. This song is essentially a song talkin to a girl and askin her questions to see where her mind is at. Great song and Nate Dogg hasn't sounded this good in a longgggg time. The beat is off da hook. Track 15 \\"Don't Push Me\\" features Eminem again and once again is STRONG. Track 16 \\"Gotta make it to Heaven, I'm going thru Hell\\" pretty much sums up this CD. Just raw East Coast Gansta Rap! \\"Wanksta\\" makes an appearance here but really it's just a playful radio cut to me. Overall this CD is great. He puts his foot down and even steps to Nas and Jigga. My favorite tracks are 2-11, 14-16. I personally haven't heard anything this raw in a long long time. The hype for this dude is incredible and fortunately the CD comes about as close as it possibly could to that. After a few earchecks this is a must have for the true hip hop fan..
B00005JA2B|5.0|I'm not going to go into much detail because quite a few of these reviewers wound up doing a better job than I ever could. First off, the music on Leftoverture is something to behold. The inspired lyrics, the inventive arrangements, the passionate playing and vocal performances, the crisp, clean production, it really doesn't get any better than this (and I'm really not that all into rock music, mind you!). But I did find myself enjoying this album more and more with every listen. I'm not sure if Kansas were as big as they should've been at the time this creative gem was released, but something tells me they were as talented and imaginative as any band that was around at the time they hit their creative stride, rock or otherwise. Carry On Wayward Son may have been the primary reason for the album's multi-platinum success, but don't be afraid to play the entire set. IT'S THAT GOOD.
B00005JLZL|5.0|this was a very good movie...i would be suprised if someone did not enjoy it. It kept me on the edge of my seat and wondering what would happen next. The casting was perfect and Kate was wonderful. I couldnt have picked a better person. The twists at the end left you comtemplating the whole movie and the motives. I recommed it for a friday night...this isnt a relaxing movie to see though, it is not a chick flick :-)
6304806426|5.0|I would say, after looking at the reviews below, that this is a film that one either loves or hates. No middle ground. Some are bored. More (including myself) are mesmerized by it's sublime beauty, thought-provoking story, and wonderfully sensitive acting performances. But, words can't convey the feelings I have for this film. I love it passionately. The DVD is fine, but is a bare-bones edition. The many fans of The English Patient deserve a &quot;loaded&quot; edition.
B00005JLRR|5.0|This movie was the best of them all. It took off in a bang with an adventure down on the planet and then got a little more serious with meeting Shinzon, Picard's Nemesis. Then it finished off with the best and most ultimate battle scene that Star Trek has ever seen, and then the death of a beloved friend. This movie outdoes them all by far!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was so happy to see this CD receive so much praise at the Grammy Awards. Lately there has been a significant amount of SPAM (Stuff Posing As Music) released. For those of you who are disgusted with the state of pop and rock music, you know what I mean. It is refreshing to see an artisit who breaks the rules of what is considered popular to rule supreme!<br />To some, this CD may appear simple, but if you listen closely you can see the many layers within each song. Don't compare it to some of jazz's greats. Norah is not trying to copy any of them. She captures the essence of each song and runs with it.  Each track she sings comes forth velvet smooth. The layers of piano, bass and guitar comppliment her nicely. <br />Bottom line: if you into the run of the mill pop (...), do not buy this CD. If you enjoy a well made, polished music whithout the (...) attached, you will enjoy this beautiful disc.
B00005N5RM|5.0|This 1988 version of The Blob is fantastic. I Love this movie so much, words cannot describe. Shawnee Smith, Kevin Dillion, Donovan Leitch, erika eleniak, candy clarke and the always georgeou Ricky Paull Goldin are all perfectly cast in their roles. The effects are great. I adore the music. Chuck Russell made the best movie. One of the best movies around.
B00007JMCX|5.0|I don't give a darn about special features on DVDs.  I haven't even bothered with the second disc of this newly released Special Edition.  I want the best picture and sound quality I can find, and this Anchor Bay release trumps the previous edition on both counts.  This movie looks superb, like the creme filling in a Hostess cupcake:  sharp, with vibrant colors.  The DTS surround mix is a gem, too.  <br />The movie is very atmospheric and not for those with a short attention span.  I babysit my friend's kids, and they dozed off far before the ending (give 'em a break, it's 2 hours and 20 minutes!).  But yes, you will see full frontal nudity from David Bowie and (briefly) Rip Torn.  That's gotta count for something!!
B00005V9HA|5.0|Re-Animator is excellent. There's so much that I love about this film. Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna did a fantasic job. Barbara Crampton and Bruce Abbot are perfect as Meg and Dan. The love story blends beautifully with the gore and horror that is going on. This DVD is packed with extras, a definite must for all the fans out there.
B00003CXXM|5.0|At first I was skeptical at the thought of Matt Damon playing any kind of spy at all. It had me nervous that he was in a Doug Liman film as well. Liman usually has fast paced cool movies, that have a huge element of cool to them. But when it came out, I waited in line for a first night viewing because of Liman's direction.<BR>I am so glad that I did. Damon as the amnesiac Jason Bourne was a great casting choice, all my fears went unnoticed in this movie. It was fast paced and great. Franke Potente as the love interest was also good, as she played off of Damon's Bourne very well. The love story was not really a key point to the story and through out Bourne had a certain coldness toward Maria as he tried to get his life back together. The ALWAYS great Chris Cooper was in the movie as well and he played the leader of the orginzation very well. <BR>The presentation knocked me out too. The country side and city wide scopes of Europe were a great back drop to this story. The car chase scene through the streets was not as great as Ronin but was fun to watch. <BR>The only negative I really have in this movie is the \\"What the Heck?\\" casting of Julia Stiles. She seemed too cardboard in what could have been an important role.<BR>Bring on Bourne Supremacy!!!
076780421X|3.0|More Suzanne Snyder. One of the most excellent actress' of the 80's. I love her .
B00005YW4H|5.0|she has a great voice and nice song.  a shoe in at grammy time.
B00005K3O4|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, 'Killer Klowns is the best movie.I only brought this rare gem a year ago because I hadn't seen it since I was little and had some memories of it. The verdict- I now have a new appreciation for this extremly creative, witty, fun, exciting,creepy in parts with the superb musical score. As soon as I brought a copy and got home on a Thursday afternoon, I prepared myself for the good or worse. Once the credit sequence began and the delicious song 'Killer Klowns'started by The Dickies, I had a good feeling about the time I was in for. Not to mention it doesn't hurt that Suzanne Snyder- one of my favourite actress is one of the leads. This film is excellent. A must have for any fans.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Even though the movie was cool, I hated how dark it was.  I couldent see anything because the lights were always terned out.  I dont think the movie is as good as other superhero movies like X-men and Spiderman but it holds its own.
B00006SFBD|4.0|Opeth is a band like no other. Their progressive metal sounds have sprouted forth from their backwoods Stockholm, Sweden beginnings and blossomed them into the amazing and powerful musical force they are today. Opeth has gained immense popularity because they dare to be a little different. Plus they have enormous listener potential. Their growing prog/metal fan base easily encompasses fans from Metallica to Morbid Angel; from King Crimson to Kataklysm; from Captain Beyond to Cephalic Carnage, and beyond.<br />Deliverance, the bands sixth release, is a journey thru colorful musical landscapes. Songs flow one to another. At points it resonates on the same wavelength as the great 70s prog bands, then again it effortlessly turns contemporary and ferocious while smoothly howling with death metal glee. The dynamics are amazing as always. I've seen this release on more than a few Top 10 metal lists for 2002.<br />Song lengths on Deliverance are epic. This just means it takes a bit longer for the songs to grow on you as you become familiar with it.  Only one of the 6 tracks listed on the sleeve clocks in at less than 10 min long. This is nothing new for the mighty Opeth tho. In fact, their 2nd album Morningrise, boasted a 20+ minute track! Wowzers!!<br />One of Opeth's early notable Stateside shows was playing for a packed room at Milwaukee Metalfest in 2000. I was there. It was amazing to behold. On Jan 27, 2003, I saw them again in front of a packed Chicago House of Blues audience. Stunning. Be on the lookout for these rising prog/metal giants. You won't want to miss them. <br />Deliverance certainly delivers the goods. Spring of 2003 will bring us Damnation. Recorded at the same time as Deliverance, it is the second part of what Deliverance started. I can't wait!  Andrew Frey
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's &quot; Lateralus&quot; is way, way difirent then their earlier stuff,  such albums like  &quot;opiate&quot; , &quot;undertow&quot; , &quot;aenima&quot; but it still sounds good as ever ! Well, on tool's &quot;lateralus&quot;I love songs like &quot; tick and leeches&quot;  , &quot;the grudge&quot; ,  and , &quot;lateralus&quot; because those are realy great tracks! The rest of the album isn't bad at all ! Buy, its worth it!

I love \\"wait and bleed\\" , \\"liberate\\" , \\"eyeless\\" , \\"sic\\" , \\"surfacing\\", and, \\"spit it out\\" because those are realy the main songs i enjoyed on this wonderfull disc! i basically  got  slipknot's  long sleeve,hoodi,t-shirts,hats, and, dvds... Because i think they deserve it!! I realy hope that these guys can come up with a new fresh disc that what im waiting for, laters!
B00005YW4H|5.0|While people certainly are entitled to their opinions about Norah Jones' talent and musicianship, people who peg her as part of a trend of &quot;putting a pretty woman behind a piano&quot; couldn't be more wrong. No one &quot;put&quot; her anywhere. It's unfair to slag her just because she happens to be a pretty woman who plays piano. Her music and its production are honest, simple and direct, and most of all, totally devoid of pretension, which is so refreshing in this day and age. That she passed up major labels in favor of the smaller Blue Note says volumes.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Considering that this album was released nearly a year after his death, it comes as a pleasant surprise that this is generally an upbeat collection. It helps that many of these tunes were written before George became ill. George's good friend and fellow Wilbury, Jeff Lynne, stepped in after George's death and helped complete the CD, along with George's son. Jeff showed restraint by not re-creating either the Cloud Nine sound or the Traveling Wilburys. Instead, this collection evokes memories of many different facets of George's solo career. \\"Any Road\\" certainly has the Wilbury sound, and \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" reminds one of the Cloud Nine era. For fans of George's early 70's work, they will enjoy \\"Vatican P2 Blues\\", which sounds like it could have been on All Things Must Pass. Similarly, George's acerbic wit is in fine form on \\"Brainwashed\\", which reminds one of the writing on \\"This Song\\" from the 70's. This is an excellent addition to any George Harrison fan's collection.
B000005HNQ|5.0|A long time ago this was my first purchase of The Gathering's catalogue because the general consensus seemed to indicate it was their best. I have all of their albums now and often feel torn about which album of theirs I like the most. However, it's easy to make a case for _Nighttime Birds_ as top of the line.<br />The Gathering left the whole doom metal thing behind before _Mandylion_, and with _Nighttime Birds_ they continue their exploration of beautiful female vocals with the heavier backdrop. _Nighttime Birds_ shows the lighter, more ethereal side of the band taking hold more strongly as well. &quot;On Most Surfaces&quot; opens the album surging through heavy riffs and moody atmospheres, and it has a soaring vocal that would probably be dismissed as bombastic were Anneke van Giersbergen's voice not so incredible. Hers is a voice of diamond and ice, beautiful but chilling. It is not surprising that when she sings, &quot;I am the snow falling down on you,&quot; the spine-tingling kiss of her words are as soft and light as falling snowflakes. Songs like &quot;Kevin's Telescope&quot; and the later parts of &quot;Confusion&quot; climb to great heights, heaved up by powerful epic billows of keyboards and electric distortion. Cryptic lyrics go well with the aura of mystery painted by ethereal guitar lines and penetrating vocal melodies of the title track, as well as the inconspicuous layer of stark percussion which hides behind guitar and keys. &quot;The May Song&quot; is interesting, juxtaposing the warmth of a mellow Hammond organ (love that sound) and softly strummed guitars with a confrontational vocal backed by a more aggressive arrangement on the chorus. &quot;Shrink&quot; is a haunting piano ballad with van Giersbergen's voice bleeding onto the floor in the prettiest way. &quot;I shrink and shrink until I'm gone,&quot; she sings sadly as an understated eighth-rock beat enters with a vaporous guitar line snaking through the arrangement. Beautiful.<br />Although I think I prefer the experimentation and atmosphere on _How to Measure a Planet?_, _Nighttime Birds_ is an excellent work. I probably listen to it more anyway since it's not as long, also (it can be hard to squeeze in a double-album sometimes). Really though, you can't go wrong with any album of The Gathering's that involves Anneke van Giersbergen. That voice is the audio equivalent of Tropicana orange juice: pure, rich in vitamins, and tasty.I think I prefer the experimentation and atmosphere on _How to Measure a Planet?_, _Nighttime Birds_ is an excellent work.

B00007KWHP|5.0|This is the third CD release of this album and it begs the question, why couldn't Atlantic have tacked on these two bonus tracks when they originally remastered this album several years ago? Answer: record company greed. You can't tell me these bonus tracks weren't available for the first reissue. That being said, this is perhaps the best place to start if you are just discovering the band. &quot;Roundabout&quot; and &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot; were the FM radio favorites, but &quot;Heart Of the Sunrise&quot; is the song where Yes really flex their muscles. &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot; is one of the most underrated songs in the Yes catalog and one of many highlights here.
B000002H70|5.0|I've been lucky enough to own a well-worn copy (which has been nicked to the point where I now must replace it, and will gladly do) for over 13 years now.  While not normally compelled to put up Amazon reviews, I'm compelled to make an exception on this one -- it's perhaps the one album that I'd probably remember and respond if asked a favorite, and I wouldn't consider myself a huge fan.  It's simply their best work, and I've been completely disappointed in everything else they've done since.   Robert Simth's pure genius in manipulating the emotional psyche is both subtle and unique, and he captivates the imagination of the listener through the dark ambience of the piece -- it wends through hopelessness, despair and emotional torment as craftily as it bends back to spirit and hope.  Not an easy task.<br />Assuming you're already a fan, I'd be speaking to the converted.  For those who aren't fans, it's best described as a very brooding, melancholy, and gothic album, very thematically composed, and the Top-40 single on the album is by far not the best track (although among the few under 5 minutes).  The remaining 11 tracks are much more listenable, creative, and inspired.  \\"Same Deep Water as You\\" and the title track I'd consider the standouts, \\"Prayers for Rain\\" boasts a more brooding flare.  <br />Smith's songwriting skills and the depth of the arrangements are most evident here, his earlier and later works not demonstrating the emotional depth or the mastery in which he guides the listener down his chosen path.  To experience exactly what that means, do yourself the favor of listening to the entire work.
B000003TAW|5.0|(laughs) ok, ok! I know im some one who likes metal but i realy love weezer i been to  one of their concerts and i realy enjoy it! I mean its music so i guess i have the right to like both deathmetal and this genre of music, right ? Well, i think so ! I  realy  enjoy the song &quot;say it ain so&quot; great complex  sound  with some nice 80's guitar soft riffs!! Laters !
B00005JM1D|4.0|old school was absolutely hilarious, my wife and I saw it opening weekend and its the hardest I've ever laughed in the theater.  Will Ferrell is outstanding and although the plot is very average the movie brings many laughs.  Anyone above the age of 26 will appreciate the humor old school offers.
B00004S8Q9|4.0|I love both of Badlands other albums and they were a seriously underatted band that was very tight. Jake E. Lee was/is still one of my favorite guitar players and &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;Voodoo Highway&quot; are still some of my favorite albums. If you find either of those albums dont hesitate to buy them they are well worth it. This one is good, but a little raw and trite. Still considering we have very few albums/ and songs from this band, you should get what you can. Keep it up Jake we are still listening. God bless Ray.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Heavy Metal with a childrens qoir, opera singer, string ensemble and ancient german nursery rhymes. Some of the best lyrics ever on a heavy metal or any other musik CD ( I am german by birth <BR>and have always avoided german musik as the language usually doesn't lend itself to good lyrics or phonetic pleasures ) These guys exaggerate the harsh german sounds and surprise surprise enhance the musik by doing it. They takle issues way beyond the normal scope of other JOCK ROCK metal merchants. They are very tight as a band and are an awesome live experience.<BR>I am a guitar nut and applaud RAMMSTEIN for avoiding guitar solos. Their reason according to their lead singer was trying to avoid the cliche metal sound and format. They have succeded and <BR>created an original sound that is intelligent and challenging.<BR>SEHNSUCHT their 2nd CD is almost as good and shows the progress from their 1st CD as MUTTER advances the band from SEHNSUCHT.
B000000H66|5.0|Incredible,just incredible,KILLER CD,BRUTAL,Chuck Schuldiner was a god,and will be missed dearly,stand out tracks &quot;Symbolic&quot; &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; &quot;Empty Words&quot; &quot;Crystal Mountain&quot;,also check out &quot;Sound of Perseverance&quot; Death's last album,it owns!
B000002KIQ|5.0|I bought this album years ago (I have it on vinyl) after watching a special with Ry Cooder on PBS playing this music.  I was hooked.  I love all the songs.  The gospel quartet is awesome.  At the end of the TV show, he sang &quot;Coming in on a Wing and a Prayer&quot;  and I wish it was on this album.  Otherwise, I highly recommend you get this CD and if you know where I can get a recording of that last song, let me know.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I really wanted to like this album. Being an audiophile wannabe, I read all the critics' reviews and really expected a treat. I like straight-on songs without meandering meaningless intros. YHF does not fulfill on this criterion. I'm not sure what the long, boring 1 minute plus intros seek to achieve - other than provide a contrast for the approximately 4 songs that are catchy and listenable on this album. It seems like we are being set-up for audio torture for the bulk of this album and the few redeeming songs provide such relief that we are fooled into thinking this is really a work of \\"genius\\". Maybe Tweedy should have fired himself as a singer and hired someone who has a decent voice. Get someone to burn cuts 3,7,8 and 9 and trash the rest.
0060930187|5.0|Initialy i read this book based on the fact that a friend had read it and felt that she had either (a) misunderstood the book or (b) had been very unsympethetic toward the main character and was completely unsympathetic to her situation. Taking it upon myself to see if the book did indeed reveal the mystery of Sylvia Plath's disease (for that is truly what it is), I found it to pleasantly display her feelings during the book's time frame. Between Esther's high's and low's and her continual obsession with the thought of suicide until she finally tries it for herself, and then the eventual downfall of her friend, to the release of her from the confining spaces of the institution and the horror of shock therapy. I have heard many people voice a disatified emotion toward the somewhat abrupt ending of the book. I myself, while looking at the end of Plath's life, could easily see the path that Esther would soon follow. It shows a fantastic look into the unpredictableness of mental illness and describes, in detail the uncomfortableness of being trapped inside the distorting effects that the bell jar can produce upon us. For those of you who are fortunate enough to not know the tragic effect produced by the bell jar, you are truly the lucky ones.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This production is a national treasure.  This package does it justice.  Get this set.  Put a day or two (max) aside and watch this epic in two or fewer sittings.  This production does sacred honor to the incredible sacrifices made by the greatest generation of WW2.  It could have gone Hollywood, instead it stays true to Ambrose's glorious prose.  It is steady, solid and utterly, totally overwhelming in its scope, sensitivity and completeness.  You will be exhausted and moved to tears by this epic.  It stands among the very best of storytelling and movie making.  My only regret is that it's not 100 hours longer.<br />Thank you, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, for making this project all that it could possibly be.  We will never know the equal of the men of Easy Company.  And we will never see the equal of a Band of Brothers.
B00005YW4H|1.0|The Grammy's were kind to Norah.  Her style is soothing but there is something missing.  BORING is the word that comes to mind.  Each song sounds the same.  I'll bet anyone with a little training could sound as good
B000000W5L|5.0|Sometimes called the greatest Rolling Stones album, Exile On Main Street was released in 1972 and hit number one in both America and England. Though infamously recorded mainly in Keith's filthy basement of his French villa, the album is mainly known for its grittiness.<br />In 1971, the band left to France after tax problems. Jagger and Richards composed new material and of course rummaged through old blues covers. While it was mainly recorded in the basement of Villa Nelcote, songs like Tumbling Dice, Stop Breaking Down, and Sweet Virginia had already gone through rough draft recordings during the Sticky Fingers sessions, while Loving Cup was first performed live at their 1969 Hyde Park concert, three years before the album was released.<br />Kicking off with the fast, agression-filled Rocks Off, Exile rocks harder than other Stones release. Mick Taylor and Keith Richards' styles become essentially one here, with their axes in perfect unison on Tumbling Dice, All Down The Line and Happy. And despie its naysayers, Turd On The Run is pretty good once you get used to it. Sweet Black Angel is Mick's rather strange tribute to [famous civil rights leader] Angela Davis. Shine A Light is a beautiful gospel song that is uplifting and raises your spirit with love for God, yourself and those around you. Sweet Virginia evokes the sweet southern comfort of the country.<br />Its promise is fulfilled at the end, allowing the whole band to join in on its sing-a-long chorus. All Down The Line is probably an attack on America's working class system that people like Gloria Steinem were against because of their treatment of women.<br />Happy is a steamroller rocker sung by Keith Richards that is always great live, but this original studio version kicks so much butt! Tumbling Dice is the album other classic, an uptempo tempo with the guitars in the same key. Mick Taylor's bass lines go head to head with his awesome guitar solo.<br />Exile On Main Street is the one album the band could probably never make another one of. Perhaps one day, Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Charlie will return to that French villa's filthy basement and record another sprawling two-disc album of classic material.robably never make another one of. Perhaps one day, Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Charlie will return to that French villa's filthy basement and record another sprawling two-disc album of classic material.
B00006DEF9|5.0|With all the extra stuff, this dvd is tops. The movie is so great b/c of the dance scenes. The story is okay, but the story alone makes it a chick flick. The dance stuff is awesome, and this is a good deal
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It isn't often that a film makes full use of the medium.  MR does just that.  It's a wild, thought-provoking, kalidoscopic tour de force that leaves you utterly exhausted and completely satisfied by the end.  You get the double whammy of a great story (with great music and choreography) and a mavel of technology in the how'd-they-do-that vein... without being overwhelmed with cheesy special effects.  I think you'll find this film to be highly polarizing.  You'll either love it (i.e., &quot;get it&quot;) or not.  This is a film that, for some, is an acquired taste and I strongly recommend that you give it that second or third chance -- as it WILL enchant you ultimately.  <br />Great &quot;extras&quot; on the second disk, by the way.  Worth wading thru.<br />Enjoy this E ticket ride.
B0000019HU|5.0|I bought the Spiderland CD in the spring of '92, after hearing about the band from various people and being told that it was one of the \\"scariest\\" albums around.  At this point, I was barely done with my freshman year of college, and had been getting into pop-punk & underground rock after my initial upbringing of hardcore since '87.  Slint was a band that opened up a completely new universe for me and my few friends lucky enough to be turned on to the band through me.  (Keep in mind Slint was REALLY unknown then in comparison with today, and my locales were Carlisle, PA and Cape Cod, MA.)  Some of the highlights of the calmer moments of that fall at college were lying on the floor of my townhouse room listening to \\"the album\\" in the dark with friends, or alone with headphones, and having it send chills down our spines...  Having been into Squirrel Bait since I heard them on local college radio in '87, I was so amazed and satisfied that this offshoot had taken such an unprecedented direction in style.  By my senior year, it seemed that Slint was a household word just about everywhere, but there will always be a place in my heart (and subconscious) for them.  ** A little-known fact: the first issue of the Spiderland CD (of which I have one) was released WITHOUT the white strip on the back cover which cautions: \\"This album is meant to be listened to on vinyl.\\" I think the strip has been on all pressings since 1992. Someday it will be worth millions...(ha ha) I salute all individuals who took an active interest and sought out Slint, and didn't just consume them like the \\"buzzword\\" their name had become.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Need there be any doubt about Norah Jones' talent, just look at her debut: a multi Grammy winner ... this is impressive when you look at the talent she was up against (i.e. Eminem, Bruce Springsteen, etc.) This album is rather good. I like 'Don't Know Why', the title track, the list goes on. All of the songs keep getting better and better with repeated listens. I remember the first time I heard 'Don't Know Why' on the radio, I was hooked. I didn't know who was singing this fresh sounding song on the radio. For some reason, I thought of Billy Holiday, hmmmmm.... It took me awhile to finally realize that it was Ms. Jones. Best of all, she is in her early 20's. I'm sure there will be a lot more to come. After buying 'Come Away with Me' and listening to it several times, I'm really impressed. A four star album
0060934719|5.0|This is a really great book. I would classify it as modern fantasy. The way that Neil Gaiman writes is fun, and never, ever ever boring. The book's protagonist is Tristran Thorn, from the town of Wall. His adventure through the land of Faerie is a wonderful one, although short. You could probably read this book in one or two sessions. It's not the most original story, but what it gives us is like being a kid again, but at the same time still being older. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and/or comical wit.
0811826848|5.0|This book straightens out the entire history of The Beatles.  After reading this book front-to-back, you will possess the ultimate Beatles knowledge.  I didnt know many things in this book, so it changed the way I look at them.  But, it also answered a lot of my questions about them.  With stunning photographs from the fab four's archives, this interview tells all in a first-hand account.  The one and only negative thing is that it may leave you disappointed, finding out some of the things that they have done.I highly reccomend this book to any Beatle fan.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Nemesis was a really good movie but it was nowhere near as good as the old-school Star Trek films. There was just not enough emotional closure in the film. This is billed as the \\"Final\\" trek film but we don't really see Picard truly say goodbye to his \\"family\\" on the Enterprise and we don't get the feeling that anyone cares that they will be split up. I would have liked to see Picard finally end up with Doctor Crusher and I would have liked a more sincere and heartfelt goodbye scene with Picard and Riker. Data's wake was also kind of emotionless and rushed and the crew didn't really seem to be that sad that he was gone. The continuity in the film was also poor. Worf became an Ambassador to the Klingon Empire in the end of Deep Space Nine but he somehow ended up as a Security officer on the Enterprise once again. There was no mention of his Klingon post at all. It was like we were just forced to pretend that Deep Space Nine was not part of the Trek Universe in that aspect. Wesley Crusher's appearance also affected the Trek continuity negatively because he left Starfleet in the final season of the series yet he was in a uniform at Riker's wedding. He was also given incredible superhuman powers that would make his appearance at a mortal wedding ceremony impossible. Tom Hardy, on the plus side, was excellent as Shinzon. He truly made the film worth watching. The scenes with Picard and Shinzon were great and I wish there were more of them. I hope the DVD fixes the timeline errors and I look forward to buying it. It's not a great Trek film but it is not the worst in the Trek series. It's nowhere near as bad as one and nine. (What the heck were they thinking when they made nine?)
B00005YW4H|5.0|O.K. I was very skeptical about her CD.  I, too, said &quot;What's the big deal about her?&quot;  After listening a few times and watching her on, (of all channels, MTV) I was sold on her.  She is a talent.  Unlike Brittney &amp; Christina, she has a beautiful voice and can play her own music.  &quot;Don't Know Why?&quot; is a classic.  I predict it will be sung by other artists for years to come.  My personal favorite is her cover of the Roxy Music classic, &quot;More Than This&quot; as it is sung with such smoothnness.  Whether this trend will continue is anyone's guess.  But it has put Smooth Jazz on the map!!  Like her or not, she's going to be around for a long time, unlike Brittney &amp; Christina who will be on a what ever happened show on VH1.
B00005JLXC|3.0|I suppose I expected too much. A lot of critics holding this one up higher than it deserved, too many people saying Ben Affleck made his finest performance yet. Anyway, there where a lot of problems, but most of them come from a tired cliched super hero plot line and very poor direction and editing. The man who killed Owen Meany needs to make a few more movies before he can handle the action genre. Didn't have a fraction of the fun and excitment of Spider-Man, or the mood of Batman.<br />Decent performances by the cast, a little campy on Colin Farrel's part, but what can you do. Jennifer and Ben did the best they could be expected with such a briefly scripted romance, another weak point. <br />In my humble opinion, the script needed a few more rewrites and an experienced director.<br />As it is, didn't hate, didn't love it.  Just disappointed.<br />God . . . no one is going to like this review . . .
0375703861|5.0|This was a great novel!  I read it while I was traveling and could not put it down.  Zadie does a great job bringing out race relations and the difficulties often faced by immigrant parents trying to bring their children up in a culture that is not their own.  Her writing was contemporary yet classic.  I was very impressed with her accuracy and her ability to really give you a sense of her very human characters.  I could see how some people might not appriciate it because the book focuses on subjects that aren't experienced by everyone, just people who grew up in interracial homes or homes with immigrant parents. There is no fairy tale, she recognizes that the world looks different from that angle and describes it with all it's beauty and ugliness very elegantly.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone!
B00005JLF5|5.0|I hate to think of DS9 because Trek Fans are so quick to dismiss it. You can always find repeats of Voyager and TNG on five or six channels but you will rarely find DS9 on any station. DS9 deserves so much more because it is the best of the Trek shows. Voyager was awful (I can never understand why they found such awful actors for the series)TNG was too confusing and Enterprise just hurts the continuity and timeline of the overall Trek universe in addition to forcing us to watch such bad actors. DS9 was purely political science fiction which, in my opinion, is the best Science Fiction. You weren't forced to endure plots that only physics majors would understand (I hated learning about &quot;quantom fissures&quot; or &quot;neutron disruptions&quot; or &quot;dimensional folds&quot; on TNG and Voyager)and you didn't really have to think about confusing (and often nerdy)Science plots. You were just given intelligent stories that cleverly refleceted the real political issues we face today (I thought the Bajoran/Cardassian relationship was always eerily similar to the Israel/Palestine relationship). You were also given more straightforward action episodes on DS9 that were, in my opinion, superior to any Enterprise/Borg battle episodes on TNG. I could see a Deep Space Nine future more than a TNG future. The characters and events on DS9 are more real than they were on the other Trek shows. The crew would argue and fight and they would rarely have happy endings on the show (which is how it will really be if a DS9 station is ever made one day in the future) and the tone of the series was more dark and epic than the other Trek's. You have to buy this set if you love Star Trek. It is SOOOOO nice to know that they finally are making these box sets. Why buy TNG DVD's when you can see all the shows on TNN?
B00006AULI|1.0|From start to finish, I really could not stand this movie. It was amazingly predictable and the acting was horrible. I was never a big David Caruso fan before, but this movie made me like him that much less. A shoddy performance in a shoddy film to be sure.<br />This movie had a good idea and concept, but it didn't try hard enough. I don't get where the Blair Witch comparison comes in...maybe it was a marketing scheme.<br />All in all, a general waste of time. When the closing credits started to roll, I yearned to have the previous hour and a half of my life back.
B00005YW4H|3.0|This isn't a bad record.  Heck, I gave it three stars because it is musical and Norah has a pretty voice.  It is also impeccably produced.  But let's get this straight.  This is very, very sophisticated elevator stuff.  That it's so popular is more of an indication that Americans are looking for simpler, calmer music at a time of great stress, perhaps, than any intrinsic merit in the stuff.  It's also so different than the drech we've been exposed to in recent years--INSYNC, Eminem, Kelly (is he awful or what?)--that discovering something with musicality to it must be like a blinding, &quot;Eureka&quot; moment for many listeners.<br />I must say that I've never been a fan of country music or &quot;standards,&quot; the sensibilities of both of which are heavily infused into this record.  It just sounds like baby food tastes (the fruit flavors, anyway)--easy going in, easy going down, and leaves you feeling empty and unsatisfied.  Predigested, in other words.  Prechewed.<br />There's so much awful stuff out there masquerading as music that I suppose we would do well to encourage Ms. Jones, if for no other reason than to take airplay away from those who are really terrible.<br />But that doesn't mean we have to say this stuff is great.  Or even very good.  Sleepy Norah just isn't.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Exceptional - Norahs father, Ravi Shankar has lived in the Central Coast of San Diego for over 10 years and I think this is where Norah grew up.  This area is like &quot;Hawaii turn left&quot;. in life style, music and quiet talent like Norah. Her style is reflective of this with a personal touch of worldliness, simple compassion and provacativeness . sensual , alluring and a very real expression of everyones thoughts at one time or another.  I recall her father playing benefits at local schools. Pearl Jam grew up here, Blink 182 , Jewel lives here amongst many musicisians all the way way back to the 40's - in quiet retirement.  Several contemporary jazz artists as well. So I'm not surprised . She has the capability of being a female Sting if she continues to broaden her scope.  who doesn't have some of his music !!? Hope to congratulate you at Moonlight Beach, Norah!
0060278250|5.0|If you've read the other two, well, I don't need to say you'll love it. Garth weaves a great tale, it's not a pre-ordained outcome and well I still like that dog.
0064471837|5.0|Even as an adult reader, it was impossible not to be struck by the talent of Garth Nix who has created a tremendous trilogy of books, beginning with \\"Sabriel\\". Authors who write fantasy novels are often carried away by the worlds they create and shamefully neglect their characters. However, Nix manages a deft mix of a facinating world and magical system while simultaneously turning out extrodinarily well rounded characters. Well done, Mr. Nix!
B00003CXXM|4.0|The Bourne Identity doesn't really do anything new as an action film. It just does what it does well.<br />This is just one of those fun flicks to watch, enjoy and quickly forget. In telling the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA super secret agent who loses his memory but retains his spy training and knowledge, the film doesn't break any new ground. It covers all the standard spy genre staples without getting too clichéd (no outrageous spy gizmos a-la Bond), it tells an interesting story that isn't too overused, but formulaic enough to not be too stimulating, and provides ample excuses to bring on car chases and explosions.<br />Matt Damon adds a star to this flick, his presence always seems to raise the bar of any film he's in. It may not stretch his acting abilities, but it is fun to see him in the role of an action hero, even though his character doesn't remember he is. That amnesia is part of what makes Bourne work as a character. He isn't that confident, self-assured spy you usually get, he's confused and frightened by his physical and mental abilities. This theme of identity adds a lot to the film's atmosphere.<br />In a nutshell, don't expect anything but a good time with The Bourne Identity. It's not a memorable film, but it does it's job well.
0785813500|5.0|It doesn't seem to matter how many other horror writers I read (Stephen King included) I keep returning to Poe.  There is a mystery that pervades his poems and stories, and a mastery of language that puts him in a class all his own.  Besides, there are lesser known stories in this collection, such as &quot;William Wilson,&quot; and &quot;A Man of The Crowd,&quot; which are utterly mesmerizing in both design and implication.  But if you're looking for the commonplace you won't find it here.  Poe was a surrealist before the word was invented, and it is quite obvious that he abhorred the commonplace.  <br />Actually, his life is also quite interesting - dark and shadowy and full of contradiction.  Even the circumstances that surround his demise are interesting to ponder.  We had to wait until the advent of Kafka to find another writer who was as intriguing as Edgar Allan Poe.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Reviving the musical with a bang, Chicago brings back the fun of the all but lost genre.<br />Its simple story satirizing the judicial system and media through a pair of man-murdering women allows the film to flaunt the main intent of musicals: Singing and dancing. The cast is great in their showy performances, especially John C. Reilly in an Oscar nominated supporting role as Roxie's (Renee Zellewager) husband (Reilly though, in my opinion, is the only one really worthy of the golden statue).<br />The numbers all have electricity sizzling through them, especially a number with Roxie and her lawyer (Richard Gere) doing a ventriloquist act mocking the attorney/client relationship, and Reilly's lonely and heart felt \\"Mr. Cellophane.\\" The film feels elaborate even though the musical numbers are all on stripped down sets. The simple environments help put focus on the numbers and not on extravagant sets. It is a nice departure from the usual, and fits the film's jazz era. <br />Still, for all the good the stripped down story does for the performances, the film seems to lack a certain depth Oscar-winning films usually have. Despite of how wonderful and enjoyable the film is, I don't feel it's quite worthy of best picture, but that probably won't stop the academy from declaring it so (though I feel The Pianist or The Hours is more worthy of the distinction). However, it is still one of top 10 films of the year that, if wins, at least will likely rejuvenate the musical genre (If it's decent box office doesn't by itself).<br />Chicago is a great film for repeat viewing. It's fun, well made and well worth at least one theater experience. Don't miss it on the big screen.
630339406X|5.0|&quot;Big&quot; is a funny movie and it is Tom Hanks at his very best. Josh Baskin (David Moscow), a young boy, made a wish to be big at the carnival, and when he woke up in the morning, he found out that he was an adult (Tom Hanks, Oscar-nominated). He and his best friend, Billy (Jared Rushton), go to New York to find a machine at the carnival, to make him go back into a kid. I have this movie on video, and I strongly recommend it.
B000003S2K|5.0|This is my favorite album ever.  Listen to this turned way up or or simple play as subtle background music. It works well either way.

B000002J09|4.0|When the uninitiated (i.e. radio listeners) hear the name Led Zeppelin, the song that immediately comes to their mind is invariably Stairway To Heaven. While it's certainly a great song, it is NOT Led Zeppelin's best.<br />Hell, right on Led Zeppelin IV (Zoso, Runes, Four Corners etc.) there are at least two songs that give Stairway a real run for its money. The thundering, sinister jam When The Levee Breaks and the ethereal Tolkien-inspired ballad The Battle Of Evermore are epics in the best sense of the word. And I'm not even counting songs from other albums. Dazed And Confused, No Quarter, Kashmir, In The Light, Ten Years Gone, In My Time Of Dying, and even Achilles' Last Stand are better demonstrations of Led Zeppelin's work.<br />Now that I've gotten all that out of the way, I have to say that IV is a very consistent effort, and I'd rank it about even with Houses Of The Holy. Four Sticks (notable in that genius drummer Bonham plays using four drum sticks at once), Rock And Roll, Going To California, and Black Dog are all highlights. The only track that never did it for me was Misty Mountain Hop, but I'm in the minority.<br />If you're introducing yourself to Plant, Page, Jones, and Bonzo this is a great first album. Do yourself a favor and pursue Led Zepellin II, Houses Of The Holy, and Physical Graffitti as well.
1565847032|5.0|I work at a factory in South Carolina which is a &quot;right to work&quot; state, a total double speak term which means that my employers have the right to fire me without cause.  I am definately a wage slave who works 12 hour rotating shifts with no provisions for breaks nor ability to participate in regularly scheduled events.  This book is a bit of an introduction for me as I have tended to believe in the right wing talk radio view of unbridled capitalism as the foundation and salvation of our country.  I would recommend this book particularly to those most likely NOT to be reading this review.  It's well edited, thought provoking, logical and easy to read (though it took a good while to read due to the amount of thought provoking).  Another piece in the puzzle of my alienation and &quot;quiet desperation&quot;.
B00005JLO2|4.0|Being of Irish descent, my views about British Imperialism are not neutral at all. This remake went further to present this compelling story free of the Brito-mania of the 1938 version. However, this remake fell short of the full condemnation of imperialism as it deserves.  I would therefore give it four and a half stars. It makes me wonder if there were deleted scenes that would have made this statement but were taken out for concerns about losing box office tickets.  However, Djimon Hounsou's strong support role (as usual) made the difference for me even wanting to watch this remake. The other strong support role was that of Kate Hudson.  I would have to say that I have much more respect for Heath Ledger after seeing this movie. Care is taken to be historically accurate in period clothing, props and set. The other compelling asset of the movie is it represents real story telling, something that is rare in current movies. How about a sequel with Djimon in a lead role?  Why is an absolutely 100 percent African in a lead role politically incorrect in 2003?  The &quot;Amistad&quot; had Djimon in a support role.  However, his role was what made the movie work.  He was in a strong support role in &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  How about Abou continuing on his nomadic journey?  God puts someone else in his path.  If treated with the same nobility of character, this would be a viable box office draw for any diverse audience. In the extra material interviews, Shekhar Kapur impressed me as the type of director that could do this type of sequel and make it work intelligently.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. First fo all, the translation is just awful. I kind of liked their music when it was in russian (At least it made sense).
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is by far the best war movie/miniseries that has ever been made on this period of WWII. While Tom Hanks \\"saving Ryan's privates\\" was a good movie, this has something that that one lacked, a true story. This was not made up, color coated or told to fit someone's story, and this was the way it happened. And in response to that girl from Sweden who would not know a good movie if it fell out of the sky and hit her, this one did tell the truth. And to make one correction, the Americans did lose several battles in this movie, and the German tanks also did take out some of those shermans as well. and the Germans did plenty of killing our own soldiers after they became prisoners, so get your facts straight, and rewatch the movie and write a better review. I would highly recommend this to any one who wants a better idea of what our soldiers went through.
0316666343|5.0|I've waited several weeks after reading this book to try and write a review.<BR>My expectations of The Lovely Bones was it was a mystery novel from a very unique viewpoint - namely from the victim's narrative from an afterlife. I'm enthralled with the process of crime scene investigation and quotes \\"that the victim herself would tell her story\\" that come from investigators and law enforcement. So, obviously, I got something more and different than I expected! <BR>After reading Lovely Bones, I can say that it is a book that hit me on many different levels. In a secondary way, Lovely Bones is a mystery. But it's more. In an odd way, because of the perspective of the narrator being in Heaven, it's a coming of age story. <br />Somewhere, in the critical reviews from 'PAID\\" reviewers, this book was compared to \\"To Kill a Mockinbird\\". And it ISin the same league, or very close. \\"To Kill a Mockinbird\\" showed Kit, the main character in TKAM, the adult's world of hatred, violence, bias.  And the ways different people both are affected and deal with hatred and violence.<br />The Lovely Bones shows us another child, Susie Salmon, and her family dealing with violence.  <BR>And seeing how  each member of Susie's family has to deal with her death, and how a whole town eventually comes to grips with the violence and loss. Each person healing from the grief and anger. <br />I enjoyed the perspective of \\"heaven\\" that Alice Sebold describes. I found it broke my lifelong concepts of heaven in a reassuring way. I guess what I'm attempting to say is \\"Yea! That's what heaven should be like!\\"  Susie was able to see how others (family, friends, even her killer) dealt with her death and overcame the tragedy. Thus, helping her to come to terms and to \\"move on\\" on her journey.<br />I must say that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is an all time favorite book AND movie of mine. I can honestly say I've read the book probably 50 times and viewed the movie almost the same amount. So, I had to wait a bit to review The Lovely Bones in comparison to the all time classic. <BR>There are a few uneven parts to Lovely Bones. It isn't perfect, but The Lovely Bones can be favorably compared to Mockinbird. And Bones could very well become a classic with time. <BR>I enjoyed it on many levels. I cared about the characters. The \\"plot\\" was unique and interesting. And I can say I'll pick my copy up many times in the future to read the story again. Lovely Bones has so much going for it, most readers will forgive it's shortcomings.<br />A Happy Reader<BR>John Row
B000002LQR|5.0|Poetry doesn't get more cocky than this. Literally. Very hot, very artistic, very surreal and not offensive - always a treat, a break from the norm or even the abnormal.

B00008DDXC|4.0|I've read all the Harry Potter books 3 or 4 times. I absolutely loved the first movie (it's still one of my \\"feel good go-tos\\") and eagerly awaited the Chamber of Secrets. <br />Some of these reviewers who weren't happy with the movie but loved the books seem unsatisfied because the movie didn't follow the book \\"perfectly\\". Frankly I can't think of too many movies that have been adapted from books that do follow to the exact word (Lord of the Rings 1 and 2 are perfect examples). Books are meant to feed the individual reader's imagination, therefore everyone \\"views\\" the story uniquely, whereas a movie provides a single interpretation to many, many people.  Unless a movie maker truly butchers a film-to-book adaptation to shreds...which this movie WAS NOT...I don't see anything wrong with a filmmaker using creative license in order to create a great film.<br />Is this movie as terrific as the first? For me it started a little slowly and took some time for the \\"magical\\" quality to set in, but I enjoyed it immensely nonetheless; I have already pre-ordered the DVD. I have only seen the movie once, so I look forward to watching it again (and again!!!) to catch the nuances I missed in the theater. <br />All in all I think the characters, both old and new, were true to the characters in the book. I enjoyed seeing the Weasleys and Draco's father...I think the movie did a good job of providing a little insight as to the nature of Ron and Draco's characters. If I had anything to complain about at all, the voice of Moaning Myrtle was pretty obnoxious and it took a little getting used to the fact that the young actors aged more than a \\"summer vacation\\" from school would allow.  <br />A word of caution to those with weak stomachs: The slug scene(s) (after Ron's spell on Draco backfires on him) are pretty nauseating. Keep one hand over your eyes and peek through your fingers to watch...And...if you don't like spiders, the spider scenes are kind of scary too.<br />If you've read thebook and absolutely want the movie to be a perfect adaptation...well, you may be disappointed. But If you love the magic of all the books and enjoyed the magic of the first film...and can allow yourself to let go of the necessary differentiations between the written and filmed versions, you'll enjoy COS...it's definitely worth getting the DVD.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Like Sheryl Crow, Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan, John Mayer does not have the best conventional-sounding voice. But as is the case with these particular artists, it's actually quite appealing in it's own way, and so are these songs. So it's a little on the poppy side? Big deal-it does what music is supposed to do-either make you feel good or make you think. On both terms, this CD is quite a success. Any one who has doubts about John Mayer's talent should have caught his accapella (just himself and his guitar) perfomance of &quot;Your Body's A Wonderland&quot; on the 2003 grammys. He'll certainly be around for awhile.
B00004Z400|5.0|White Pony is an offering that shows a maturity added to the bands show of emotion, primal rage, and melody.  Lyrically, a lot of the lyrics are quit vague, which can give a listener an actual opertunity to find a meaning to each song.  This, the third offering from the band, is more melodic than the first two albums, but still offers the primal rage, and raw emotion.  It shows more maturity in their writing, and composing. At the end of this amazing ride, only 2 questions.......What is in store for their next offering, and why not put out all their different acoustic versions of different songs?????  An amazing offering, truly an album for any hard rock fan to own, along with Adrenaline, and Around the Fur
B000001TVD|5.0|anyone who fails to rate this one a perfect score has got to be a bit of a rook.  loose hard rock with gospel etc.....money.  if you don't like the effect....what are you thinking?
B000002N2Z|4.0|This, the beginning of an original, heavy and at the same time, melodic band, is an honest, and worthy effort.  The cd kicks off, and gets more primal, and more powerful as you get further and further in.  The Deftones are unfortunately grouped with rap-metal all too often.  They have a unique blend of primal rage, melody, and emotion that will captivate any listener along the ride through each album.
B000001TVD|5.0|anyone who fails to rate this one a perfect score has got to be super stupid.  if you don't like the effect....what are you thinking?
B000002NIW|5.0|This, the second installment so far of the Deftones, is masterful, emotional, and an extremely well writen album.  High intesity, powerful emotions, and a bit of art and poetic expression make this a truly unique and powerful album.  The mix of these elements may be most noticable on &quot;Be Quiet and Drive(Far Away)&quot;.  It's unfortunate the way pop music is too simple with no true emotion, otherwise, this could be one of the biggest bands in the world.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This strange, hypnotic film is one of the best and most original I have seen in awhile!  The first time I watched it I was blown away and thought about it for several days afterward...I had to run out and buy it.  When I watched it the second time I noticed so many more things that I hadn't seen the first time.  It is so worth seeing and evening adding to your DVD collection.  It has a great cast, and Jake Gyllenhaal is so amazing in this haunting performance.  I am a huge fan!
0151008116|5.0|I listened to this book on tape.  The narrator's voice of Pi brought him to life.  The character, Pi was endearing, inquisitive and intelligent.  I wanted to go searching for him in the ocean and adopt him.  I wouldn't say that &quot;it made me believe in God.&quot;..but it did make me believe in the human spirit and the choices we make it life.  It made me believe in the resilence of people.
B00005YW4H|2.0|This is my first negative review that I have posted on Amazon. I guess I finally had to voice my opinion that I totally wasted my money buying this album.<br />If there ever was an artist that was overhyped for what you get then this is the album.  The fact that MTV and VH1 kept playing that video (and She actually does look good in the video) made me think that I was going to get something special and really enjoy another new artist (maybe a more mature Vanessa Carlton or Michelle Branch, artists who at least deliver on their initial promise). <br />After that one song it was just one monotonous drone. Yes it might match some smoke filled club as background music while I still have an ongoing conversation with someone else, but if I wanted tunes that should be played in a supermarket then I would have thought it would be labeled as such.  I do not want to sound evil or mean-spirited but I was sooo disappointed when I got this CD home.<br />Except for \\"Don't Know Why\\" and maybe \\"Come Away with Me\\" there is no other song on this CD that isn't a word jumble of every other song on the CD.  And all that other song is some tired drone that should be played to calm down hyperactive children.<br />I give this album 2 stars because \\"Don't know Why\\" is an interesting song that should be listened to for itself but the rest of the album is just not worth it.  If you can't record it off of the radio then by all means buy the CD for that one song. Just do not expect a whole CD of great songs because you will be disappointed.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Re-Animator is a classic gore film, with great effects and an original story. This Millenium Edition DVD makes the movie even more enjoyable. A second disc is loaded with great extras and the first disc gives you Re-Animator in spectacular quality, in its uncut glory. If you're a gorehound who still hasnt seen this, I highly reccomend it. Its not your stereotypical zombie flick, but its one with a twist that you'll enjoy nonetheless.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I liked Wilco before this album, but YHF made a believer of me. Merging Tweedy's deservedly admired lyrics and what you  might call a wall of sonic sound, this album doesn't disappoint. It's pensive, rocking, mysterious, and ultimately, I can't stop listening to it. Why it wasn't even NOMINATED for a Grammy is beyond me..it's this year's Pet Sounds, and will be bought and talked about for years to come.
B0000844IT|5.0|Yes, This movie is quite incredible. Its another must for any horror fan, and just like the other Evil Dead films, it delivers quite nicely. I love everything about this movie. The combo of comedy and gore and the one-liners that Bruce Campell delivers are classic. \\"This is my boomstick\\", \\"Gimme some shuga baby\\", and \\"Hail to The King\\", are all great. I also like the story and Ash not saying the words right really added to it. Gory?, very. Hillarious?, Very. My favorite scenes include the battle with Ash and Evil Ash, the attack of the tiny little Ash's and when the skeleton army shows up. The effects are good as well. JUST BUY IT!
B00005JLZL|3.0|Although I did enjoy watching the movie, when I walked out, my first words to my husband were, \\"Liberals are stupid.\\"  To begin with, even though he is obviously being cuckolded by his wife, David Gale does nothing to rid himself of her and keep his beloved son.  Instead he does something so terribly stupid that he loses everything: his son, his reputation, and his job.  Even a moron would have been suspicious when she asks him to bite her shoulder, let alone to tear off her pants and to be rough!  <br />Secondly, is there any real reason why two such attractive actresses as Kate Winslet and Laura Linney have to look and dress so unattractively?  Is it because they believe they won't be taken seriously if they're pretty?  What harm would a few minutes with a curling iron do to their causes?  Linney's character says, \\"I've tried so hard not to be a sex object.\\"  Good God, why?<br />Third, it is obvious practically from the beginning that one character is not who he/she appears to be.  Thus it is not much of a surprise when it is revealed at the end.<br />Fourth, if Winslett is indeed a serious writer, why does she call herself \\"Bitsey?\\"  And why would a smart woman not return the obviously defective rental vehicle for another one?  Can't she anticipate her dash through the rain in a \\"climactic\\" scene?<br />Fifth, I hated the thinly veiled portrayal of then-governor George W. Bush.  Why didn't they just make him leer and twirl his mustache like Snidely Whiplash?  His point of view was a valid one, but the deck was stacked against him.<br />Sixth, when the rape charges against David Gale were dropped, why was the deck so stacked against him?  Why the disgusting motel with the \\"mud pool?\\"  Where were his friends and supporters?  For all his intelligence, how did he allow himself to fall so far?  <br />Seventh, why did Berlin set up the \\"rape?\\"  <br />As for the denouement itself, I did understand the noble motives of all concerned.  However, the nudity, I felt, was gratuitous and was repeated more than was necessary.  <br />On the plus side, I feel that Spacey, Winslett, Linney, and especially Gabriel Mann as the young intern Zack did a good job.  The point of view about capital punishment was one that deserved to be expressed.  It was, as I said previously, an enjoyable two hours, but, even though I'm a big fan of Kevin Spacey, I do not want to sit through it again.<br />The title of this review refers to a quote David Gale uses in his debate with the governor.  Churchill was definitely right!
B00000IMCW|5.0|I love this movie. The gore is spectacular, the story is good, the characters are likeable, and I'd say its preety high quality for the run of the mill Zombie epics out there. This film belongs in every gorehounds collection. Night Of The Living Dead was great as well, but I still favor this more. It's actually hard to believe that this is a sequel. DOTD will always be one of my favorite horror films and one that continues to bring a twisted smile to my face. If you like horror, this is essential.
0316666343|1.0|The only word I can use to describe this book, is &quot;disturbing.&quot;  This author obviously has some serious emotional issues that she needs to deal with.
6305841861|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. The combo of gore and comedy is great. If you're a fan of movies like Re-Animator or Street Trash, you need this in your collection. I actually like this better than Evil Dead. For a sequel, I say this is one of the best ones I've ever come across. The effects and story are incredible and this is one of the movies I can never get sick of. Its not your basic Zombie or Living Dead movie, but its one with a twist. For any horror fan, this is a must.
0553277472|4.0|the story of one man's journey to the origins of modern occidental thought, pirsig attempts to diagnose modern man's vapid condition and find a cure. zen and the art... is the tale of phaedrus, \\"the wolf,\\" who favors intuition before reason, concluding the foundation of all thought is emotion, the primary reality. the problem is, so few today recognize the importance and value of emotions.  having deified reason and demonized passion, individuals have lost any authentic zest for life; they are mere sheep. simply adjust the definition of \\"what is good?\\" and recognize that which is good cannot be rigidly defined rationally by some shepherd--i.e. jesus--who knows best, but rather must be intuited and expressed naturally--like a wolf--beyond the bounds of what the shepherd deems safe. the wolf is liberated, living dangerously, free to wander in solitude wherever, slave to none. <br />pirsig has a real eye for beauty and an almost-hemingway skill with words. the book is an excellent read, but the author is not as revolutionary as he makes himself out to be: his epiphany is shared by many, especially by nietzsche and the existentialists. another re-valuation of values, updated.
068484267X|4.0|I believe Angela's Ashes is a great story and very worthwhile to read.  Frank McCourt's dreams of growing out of poverty and making a better life for himself sends the story on a whirlwind of tragedies and hilarious happenings.  He is such a strong character for supporting his family, his dreams, and himself.  Without Frank, I do not believe the McCourt's would have survived the way they did.  His story is truly inspirational and proves that anything is possible as long as you keep your dreams alive.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've been playing music all my life and know a great artist and song when I hear them. It is very refreshing to hear beautiful songs like &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and just relax with a great arrangement and the sound of a mellow voice that is not screaming in my ear. There aren't many true love songs to just dance and listen to at the same time. I think Norah Jones brings a new fresh touch to easy listening music for any age. Thanks. Ken Filardo
0375410341|5.0|\\"The house of Leaves\\" is not a half-ass read. This Novel is groundbreaking filled with beautiful as well as dark imagery. Remember the telephone game when you were little? That is what this book is about, A story told by someone who heard the story from someone else who heard the story from someone else. The main character Johnny Truant becomes obsessed with telling this story which he heard about through the notes of a dead blind man named Zampano about a family whose House is larger on the inside than the outside. Hallways appear out of nowhere and the father feels the need to explore. With that said read the book. I liked this novel because it breaks a lot of literary rules, for instance there is a part where the characters are lost in a hallway and to read it you literally have to flip the book around, the text is sometimes written backwards, in reverse, written  so that you have to place the book in front of a mirror to read the mirror image. This allows the reader to really get lost in the book. WHile reading it I started to have strange and bizarre dreams and from others I have talked to the same thing has occured. This book is not an easy read, but once you finish you feel as if you have truly accomplished something.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Everything about this rules:  The packaging, the booklet, the sound of the cd.  This is the ultimate edition of this classic album &amp; I haven't had a chance to access the additional stuff by computer yet, but I bet it's killer too!  Very well done, Legacy!

B00003CXE7|5.0|I loved this movie!  The acting was not just great, it was consummate acting without peer.  Phoenix was fantastic as the perverted, maniacal Comodus.  Crowe was utterly fantastic in his roll as Maximus.  The story held together from the opening sequences, and Scott's brilliant artistic direction made this an all-time classic.  I have to admit that I actually cried at the end.  Awesome.
0316666343|3.0|This book kept my attention, but I was a little &quot;let down&quot; in the end. Flowery and wordy...but OK.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This CD is awesome.  This band is unique.  Often times wierd, but definitely a keeper.  The title track is inspiring and was written for a friend of the band, who passed away.  Very intresting lyrics that can be interpreted many different ways.  This album is great and I encourage the purchase of it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"Beggars Banquet\\" represented a high water mark for the Stones! This was the Stones first album where they outdistanced their old nemesis The Beatles on their eclectic \\"White Album.\\" <br />After the controversal \\"Satanic Majesties Request,\\" the band returned to their bluesy roots. Jagger and Richards wrote their best songs here: \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\"\\"Street Fighting Man,\\"\\"Salt of the Earth,\\" and \\"No Expectations.\\" <br />The main themes of the album references the Bible, good versus evil, social injustice, lost love and despair. <br />Brian Jones made his last significant contribution here via the slide guitar.<br />This classic 60's album is a must have for your collection!
B00005QZWI|5.0|A very good soundtrack.  If you loved the music from the movie, get this.  Great for relaxing at home.
B000002J1M|4.0|This album marks the start of Genesis' really good period, and after this album they went on to produce some true classics. But this one, which is somewhat simpler in scope than &quot;Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; and not as technically perfect as &quot;Selling England..&quot;, is my favorite. Throughout the record the interplay between the musicians is stunning, as they weave in and out of complex time signatures and demanding arrangements. Anyone who has ever heard Phil Collins sing will be pleasantly surprised to find out htat he actually has musical talent when in charge of the drums.<br />A common complaint about Genesis is that Gabriel always has to write those really stupid songs (re, &quot;Epping Forest&quot; from &quot;Selling England&quot;). He does that on this one, with &quot;Get 'em out by friday&quot;, but it isn't really too annoying because the music is so good, you don't mind the dumb plotline. There's also &quot;Time Table&quot;, a song that several people thought was stupid but I kind of liked it. But the real standout is &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;, a (nearly) sidelong epic opus that starts out with two people eating dinner and ends with the apocalype and the return of Christ. Far out.<br />If you've heard &quot;Selling England&quot; or &quot;Lamb Lies Down&quot;, or Genesis' earlier records, you'll enjoy this one. It's also a good album for any fan of Prog.

I had the single but sold it awhile back. I think Dream Dancer is one of their finest moments but felt it belonged on the Transcendence release not the premiere. Go search the web for the cd single for Lonely and good luck! I have the tune on tape from the cd as well and try to take care of but hey everything must die!<BR>Good Luck and let me knwo if ya find it!
B00007GZQI|3.0|It's a pity : the audio is often very bad, and the are no extras (like trailers), and the presentation is not in widescreen... I hope that someday someone will issue a better DVD-release
B0000640VO|5.0|After watching trailers for this movie and trying to find someone to go to see it with me (and failing), I eventually rented this movie a few weeks after it was released on DVD. I have never been more impressed with a movie before. The filmmaking is stunning, the story captivating, and the characters... well... damn. Amelie is hands down the cutest character any movie has ever had, and also one of the most interesting. More so, the character is so wonderfully played by Audrey Tautou.<br />To show you somewhat how much I loved this movie, I've started learning French again just so I can enjoy this movie without the subtitles. Of course, I hope to use it for so much more (travel, other films, etc), but this movie was what spurred me to finally study it again.<br />So I recommend you buy this immediately. If you're not into artsy, foreign films, rent it first, but I feel confident you will enjoy it.
0385720920|4.0|chuck really hits the nail on the head with this portal into the head of a sexaholic.  i am personaly a member of 12step groups and this picture of an addict in the grip of his addiction is very accurate. not only does he capture this but in the meantime he manages to comment on the american society as i see... hypocritical in an comedic/disturbing fashion.  this dark little story is a genuine gem from the author of fight club.  my only complaint is the slow start into the actual plot... which is rather hard to figuer out.
B00005JLF5|4.0|While Deep Space Nine is *not* the best Trek series, in my opinion, as stated here in other reviews, it is amongst the top three. The characters were fantastic, especially Sisko, Kira, and Bashir.<br />The series is easily the best post-Roddenberry Trek to date, with Voyager and Enterprise not even worthy of the franchise. Sisko is so far the only captain (or commander, depending which season you're watching) which has ever made me reconsider Kirk as the best ever (though I still go with Kirk; Sisko is a tough challenger, but he just can't stand up to Kirk's evolution through the series and movies).<br />I would recommend any fan of Star Trek give this series a chance. The only problem is, like many shows, it changes from more episodic storylines to continuing ones as it got older. This typically reflects difficulty in writing more original, contained plots, but even these desperate attempts are played well. All in all, the episodes make for great entertainment, just be prepared for a show that's based more around politics and religion (and a lot of battle nearer the end) than any of the other Treks.<br />I would love to see the DS9 characters in a movie, especially after the disgustingly corny, predictable, and boring mess that was &quot;Nemesis.&quot;

I am a member of twelve step groups and have been working on bettering myself for 2 years now.  i have read a number of books, so called self-help books, that read like the bible and have no practicle value, in my humble opinion of course.  i came upon this book a year ago and it has catapulted me into a world i never dreamed existed.  if you truly want to change your life, READ THIS BOOK... it probably saved my life, mabey it will save yours.
B00008973A|1.0|\\"A Chorus Line\\" is probably the worst Broadway-to-film adaptation ever, ripping out the heart and soul of the stage version and making it into a Michael Douglas Movie.  For the most glaring example, try Paul's monologue, which shifts the intensity away from the subject at hand and emphasizes Douglas as a Sensitive Guy when he should be totally forgotten.  The only redeemable movie-ized bit is the opening sequence, in which the shots of long lines of auditioners is kind of fun.  The new songs add nothing.  Someone should record a competent stage version of this show to capture more of the experience (but not all; it's impossible for film to replicate the intimacy of a live performance in a theater), as the original cast recording is brilliant but incomplete.  Until then, the worst thing about this movie is that many unsuspecting souls will see it and believe that they've seen \\"A Chorus Line.\\"  I usually believe that any kind of documentation is better than none, but I'll gladly make an exception here.
0446530573|5.0|This is a hilarious book for fans of the Sopranos and, perhaps surprisingly, an actually rather good Southern Italian cookbook too.<br />If you or anybody you know was born in Avellino you will recognize the recipes as authentic and good.<br />We made the Veal Picatta substituting chicken for the Veal last night and it was excellent.  Can't wait to find a job so I can afford to buy some veal!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Lynch establishes a foreboding yet very palyful narrative here in this crazy, confusing tale.  The thing I love most is how Lynch tricks you into paying attention,(the whole movie is 1 scene, and no you can't fast forward) these little touches made it great.  Don't expect to understand this movie the first, second, or even third time; I still don't after several viewings, maybe its just that theres no clear cut ending, but it makes you think.  I can only give this my highest recomendation, buy it, emjoy it, and if you can please explain it, I sure can't
B00005YW4H|1.0|Arif Martin had a huge hand in both recordings - producing the string and horn arrangements in Dusty In Memphis over 30 years ago.  The recently released re-mastered version on Phillips is amazing. Rarely have remastered albums convinced me that the ordinary listener could tell the difference. <BR>Norah had a fine first outing with this CD, but awarding it - album of the year - is like the Sports Illustrated cover jinx. <BR>Let's give Norah another ten years to see how this album holds up and see if she can gain some soul in her life experiences which will translate to her music. For now - give Dusty a listen if you want music from the heart and soul.
B00003CWTI|5.0|THe third release from director Paul Thomas anderson ( Boogie Night, Punch Drunk Love) is a classic as his other works.  13 people in the San Fernando Valley are having a hell of a day; and this book follows them all.  This is a movie you have to watch when your REALLY awake it clocks in at over 3 hours; but its worth every minute.  For fans of the genre, P.T. Anderson fans, or hell anybody I highly reccomend this.  Buy Magnolia, sit down, and be prepared for one of the best treats in cinematic histroy.
0060930187|4.0|basically, this chick is really messed up. the society around her has all these double standards. society always has and always will. she get's messed up by everything. She hates men. Basically she follows the rules and gets hurt and decideds its mens fault or someone elses fault. Basically, she is a player hater. THis book should be called player hater. She needs to drink a 40 and try to cheer up and stop being dark and spooky. it was alright though. she writes really good and is honest.
B00005YW4H|5.0|but more likely has only 3 million fans....<BR>It's easy: Faith Hill (you'll listen to her, not to me... :) said it like it is:  &quot;I have one of her CD's in my car, another in my home&quot;  And that's exactly what has happened.  Never in my life have I conscientiously gone out and bought two exact CD's of the same artist, let alone another 5 (for my family members)....yet Norah.  She is not hype, she is not anybody to compare to, she's her talent, her ability, let her ride this wave...she has shared with us her incredible soothing and relaxing interpretation of absorbing songs.  I'm ready to go out and buy my third CD, to wake me up every morning
B000001FS3|2.0|\\"The Joshua Tree\\" starts off good with its best three songs in a row, and the excellent \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\" is of course the albums highlight. After this great introduction things go downhill and at the end of the album I'm pretty bored. I think (like at least some others) that this album is over rated - it's far from THAT good. But if people actually believe that albums like  Jay Farrer's \\"Sebastopol\\", Beth Orton's \\"Daybreaker\\", and Coldplay's \\"A rush of blood to the head\\" is worth 5 stars I guess the same goes for this one.<br />Take my word, a \\"best of\\" U2 will be enough.
0345440900|5.0|I purchased  the books &quot;the Baby Whisperer&quot; and &quot;Babytales: A Pregnancy Companion&quot; together and found both books to be wonderful and amazing...

Highly rercommended as is &quot;Babytales&quot;
B00004LN16|3.0|AC/DC keep their musical direction intact, so you won't be surprised. The material on \\"Stiff upper lip\\" is better than on the previous \\"Ballbreaker\\" since the band seem to have put more effort in the song writing. But singer Brian Johnson is not in top form on this release, and the fact is that his voice have gradually got worse ever since \\"Back in black\\". When it comes to AC/DC - what you see is what you get - and critics may say that the band is writing the same song over and over again. In some way that might be true, and if you're not a dedicated fan, I believe you'll do fine with just a couple of albums from this band. Try out \\"Highway to hell\\" (the last album with Bon Scott) and \\"Back in black\\" (the first one with Brian Johnson). They represent AC/DC in the prime!
B000069AUI|5.0|I was knocked out and floored by the exquisite, angst-ridden energy, sincerity and energy of this band on the Grammies, last night.  Coldplay, augmented by a full string section, banged out this phenomenal &quot;Politik&quot;.  I wish I had a recording of THAT performance.  I haven't witnessed so much angst since Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;.  Coldplay made the tribute to The Clash (I'm sorry to say, as I loved &quot;London Calling&quot;) seem like starving alley cats begging for an open mike.  I rarely rave so absolutely but, what I've heard so far of this band and record is an essential relief from the absolute oatmeal the record industry gets behind and shoves down your ears and your eyes.  What's with the guy wearing the bra, anyway?  Coldplay doesn't need cleavage, long legs, (though I'm not knocking those two attributes under other circumstances) attitudes, known-in-advance success. Nora Jones and associates, the eminem and ganster gang could really take some lessons from Coldplay.  Finally, a band that really HAS IT!
0316666343|4.0|Desite the popular opinion...the ending was strong in my opinion. I dare you to start this book and even try to put it down.
0060090383|4.0|Rachel's Holiday is a light, heart felt book. It has more substance and better researched than many of the British chick books out there. The book is slow to start, but when you get to the end you find out that reading it was well worth your time. The characters are well developed and so so the story. This book will make you laugh and it will also make you cry (for joy). A great quick read and highly entertaining! Now I want to read the other Marian Keyes novels.
B00007JVBI|5.0|very pleasantly surprised with this album. like another reviewer after seeing chan at a show in october [sort of] performing tracks from this album it was hard to know what to expect. however every track on this recording has something that hooks you in.  my favorite so far is 'good woman', love this track. the different layers of vocals are amazing. i usually like vedders voice but it could actually do without it, the male vocal seems a bit out of place put luckily its left muted enough not to intrude into the beauty of the rest of the song. 'free' is great too. light and fun. more girly-alt and even cheerful than one might imagine chan would be but she pulls it off. 'names' sounds like something off of her earlier albums...very melancholy.  though a fan of cat power's before i actually like the songs that sound less like past releases. 'maybe not' is slightly uptempo and gorgeous. 'he-war' the track with grohl on drums is again faster paced than the usual cp and great. the most stylistically varied CP release and the best to date.
B000005AYM|5.0|If anyone every wanted to set an IZM to their name, producing an album like this is the way to do it.<br />Baduizm is one of those perfect neo-soul albums that serves as a good yardstick for any neo-soul essentials list.<br />If you are into neo-soul and you haven't got this one you missed something pivotal.  If you just about to start a collection, this is a perfect one to start with.  <br />But be warned against getting into neo-soul as a fad; it's not for everyone!
0375823360|5.0|These books were awesome! I got them for Christmas and didn't start untill mid Jan, because they looked boring! My Mom told me it would be nice if I read them and they were awesome! You can't put them down! I reccomend them at this price anyday!
0316096199|5.0|Ms. Sebold's account of her rapeand the effect on her life is tolddirectly and honestly with little left to the imagination. Despiteher degredation, I could not helpbut feel the remorse expressed bythe rapist himself who apologizedto Ms. Sebold after the initialact, telling her he was sorry forhurting her becau she was a nicegirl.  That in direct contrast asto how he treated her during therape.  When he meets her on the street a yearlater he speaks in afriendly voice and acts as thoughshe ight be a friend, He shows nofear of her tuning him in to thepolice.  He does not know the painhe has inflicted on her.  When heis arrested and faces a policeline-up, he becomes a coniver andmanages to confuse her.  Duringthe trial he is almost amused until he hears what damage he hascaused this girl.  Is he trulysorry for his wrong doing?Another point regarding rape: whatare the effects on a male  victimof rape by another male, or even by a female?  That is a subject tobe covered by a male in anotherbook but it poses a question andassumption that all rape victimsare not females.
B00006690G|5.0|I think Slim needs to feature more artists in his songs. 50 Cent, Xzibit, and more Dr. Dre would have been nice additions to the raps. Here are reviews for each of the songs:<br />White America - 9/10 - Nice raps, nice beats. Chorus is good too.<br />Business - 10/10 - This song is far better than \\"Without Me,\\" and I don't see why it isn't a single.<br />Cleanin' Out My Closet - 8/10 - Very good rhymes, some were so ingenious that I was startled by them.<br />Square Dance - 9/10 - A comic song with a nice beat. Em's hillbilly voice is hilarious.<br />Soldier - 8/10 - Very fast rap. It'll take a few listens to get the words down. The chorus is mediocre, so you can listen to that easily.<br />Say Goodbye To Hollywood - 6/10 - Em messed up on this song, and the chorus is far too long. Worth listening to a few times, but not the best.<br />Drips - 10/10 - Very well done chorus. Obie Trice could have done some better raps...Nevertheless, his raps are nice and somewhat funny :) Slim has a nice, fast rap.<br />Without Me - 9/10 - You liked \\"The Real Slim Shady?\\" You'll love this one! The first single from the album that everyone heard months before the album even came out is one of the best on the CD.<br />Sing For The Moment - 8/10 - It's Slim rapping over Aerosmith's music. Nice rhymes and beat here.<br />Superman - 9/10 - Drips II.<br />Hailie's Song - 8/10 - Very catchy, nice to listen to.<br />When The Music Stops - 9/10 - No chorus, but D12 doesn't need one to be some of the best rappers around. Swifty McVay of D12 has the best part, Eminem just does a little catchy rap at the start.<br />Say What You Say - 12/10 - Definetly the best on the CD! A little reverse of what usually goes on when Dre and Marshall rap together. Dre goes slow and Marshall goes fast, and you'll find yourself rapping this song to yourself in public.<br />Till I Collapse - 9/10 - Simple beat, and Nate Dogg at his best. Em does some nice rapping, too.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy - 10/10 - Comical and serious raps put together with Marshall's daughter Hailie Jade. A perfect combination! Fun to listen to. Has a nice, catchy beat too.<br />All in all, this is an excellent CD. I also recommend Man vs. Machine (Xzibit) and Get Rich or Die Tryin' (50 Cent) to go along with this CD.
0792106989|5.0|Even thoe this is a fictional western you do kinda wounder could this realy have happend or simuler situation's in the real west. True john wayne movie good.
B000000I0H|3.0|This is a unique album, I purchased the original vinal record when I was in West Germany in the early 80's. The CD is missing a lively instrumental piece at the beginning of track 3. I thought it was one of the better parts of the album. I used to play tracks 1 &amp; 2 to put me to sleep at night. Track 4 is where the best parts are. The drums are great!
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris has the gift.  He knows just how to use understatement to pack the biggest bang into every laugh.  You don't see the punchline coming around the corner, so when it gets there you're surprised and tickled at the same time.  He's particularly hilarious when talking about his redneck brother who has adopted the nickname \\"The Rooster\\" and when discussing his trials in dealing with a stopped up toilet at a civilized dinner party.  Those two short segments alone are worth the price of the book.
0671027344|5.0|WOW......what a book....I am a book fanatic and never have gotten so emotionaly attached to a character like I did Charlie!

Your soul deserves it!
B00004VXF2|5.0|Well, If this is either a 1 or 5 star album, put me down for five.....No, I do not appreciate this as music, but I'm the type who, every now and then, must listen to the most awful din that I can get a hold of. This used to be the Yoko Ono side of LIVE PEACE IN TORONTO, 1969...Thank heaven's lou reed spared me of that. Its just the right kind of noise for me. Like a TV on the static channel...but a lot more interesting...you get the white noise aspect...and then thrown in here and there are some little dancing things. It nice. Its no great thing. No brilliance, just a fortunate coincidence I think. I like my Metal Machine Music.
0783229321|5.0|National Lampoon's Animal House has gotta be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life! This crude parody of college life in the '60s spawned many imitations, but none could match the fresh-faced talent or bad taste of this huge box office success. Each time I see this movie, I feel like throwing a toga party! If anyone likes any of National Lampoon's movies, I definately recommend this, because in my oppinion this is their best! Buy it today!!!
B00005JLZL|1.0|Watched this mostly bad movie last night. Kevin Spacey is interesting playing a drunk, but he doesn't play effectively seductive, particularly villainous or necessarily vague ever. He's shown more depth and more believability in other roles. The always-bankable Laura Linney was decent in it, but, on the whole, the film absolutely blew. Kate Winslet was completely annoying, doing wildly implausible and ridiculous things.<br />I'd figured out their big, special twist five minutes into the first flashback. Since the film is so clearly anti-death penalty, it doesn't even bother to notice that the State of Texas and the Death Penalty itself are not villains at the end because of the odd twist.<br />Before the key flashbacks, as well, there were quick cuts to words on paper, in chalkboards. Then, the camera would spin. That was the most annoying bit of editing I'd ever seen.<br />RAPE, REPUTATION, ACCUSATION, MURDER - the signs would flash.<br />In my seat, I wanted a notebook to hold up to the screen. BORED, SILLY, PREDICTABLE, TEDIOUS, IRRITATING, PREACHY.<br />There have been good, interesting movies made about the death penalty. Rent THE WIDOW OF ST. PIERRE or DEAD MAN WALKING. Don't bother with this.
B00005MP58|5.0|I am going to cut to the chase here: this movie is stunning. If you love Jane Austen, you must see this.
B000002W9Q|5.0|Hi! I loved this movie and I loved this soundtrack! I have the second soundtrack too! I love the songs, &quot;Time of My life&quot; and &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot;. Ok, well I love all the songs on this CD! And to the person who said this CD was missing a song. The song that you're talking about is either &quot;Do you love me?&quot; or &quot;Loveman&quot; They were both played when Baby noticed the Dirty Dancing. And both of these songs are on the 2nd CD! I suggest you buy the second CD because its as good as this one!! I loved both CDs!
B00001MXXH|5.0|I originally saw this movie on June 27th 1986 when I graduated from High School and loved every second of it. This is the kind of movie that I have quoted scenes from to my friends ever since. And while the story forces you to distend belief quite a bit, the central focus should be something we all take to heart; That is &quot;If you don't stop to enjoy life every once in a while, you might just miss it.&quot;
B00005MAM2|5.0|The plot of this movie isnt those simple annoying unorigonal ones such as....Terrorists kidnapped your daughter/son and gotta get him back, gotta catch them all, stoping a killer and such and such.  <br />     The plot goes very deep and you have to be those careful and not wandering TV watchers to understand why this and that is going on. <br />     This movie is very hardcore in action and may be a bit to brutal, bloody and disturbing to young viewers, this movie suits young adults, or wide-eyed teens<br />     IM NOT TELLING YOU JACK ABOUT THE MOVIE BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO RUIN IT FOR U, but 2 words, BUY IT!!!
B000001OAA|5.0|Garbage is my favorite band, they're amazing. Shirley Manson is amazing, that voice is so dark, and enchanting. (Get this, she dosen't think she sings good at all)<BR>I first bought &quot;Version 2.0&quot; And it BLEW me away, I was amazed, and my opinions of music changed forever. Back then I used to listen to poppy stuff, once I got that CD, I was obsessed with depressing, dark, Rock music.<BR>Then I bought &quot;BeautifulGarbage&quot; and was very very disappointed. &quot;BeautifulGarbage&quot; was an awful album, it's too happy! It's nothing like thier other albums.<BR>Then I bought &quot;Garbage&quot; And I was reminded of a darker &quot;Version 2.0&quot;. This album is so beautifully dark and depressing, I absolutely LOVE it! Every song is great. My absolute favorites are &quot;Supervixen&quot;, &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot;, &quot;Vow&quot;, &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;, &quot;Milk&quot;, &quot;Fix Me Now&quot;, etc. They're all spectacular!<BR>Buy this!
B00008DDXC|5.0|This is one of my faves movies of all time, its even better than the first one, Theres just one thing that I dont like, Why Chris Columbus didnt put the scene of The ghosts party, anyway, the movie is great, now well see if the DVD is just as great as the movie is.
B000002LR6|3.0|This record definitely to me lost some of the industrial magic that made &quot;Mind is a Terrible Thing&quot; so creative. On the other hand though, the production on this record is a lot better and this really does sound more like Metal to me. The guitars thrash heavy and distorted, the bass will give you a whipping, and as usual Al Jourgeson's passion in his singing will help you to appreciate the anger behind all this music more. Overall, there's a lot more guitar playing on this one. <BR>Yes, this record is definitly meatier then it's predecessor, but like the previous, it will not suite everyone. It's again a lot like the previous record, each song consists of about 2 guitar riffs, 3 at most and they just repeat over and over, although this record does have more variety in terms of its lyrics. This is just what Ministry's music is all about though, and even though most people will discard it by just saying &quot;these guys have no talent, it's just the same thing over and over,&quot; the music is begging for you to look deeper, b/c even though it may not seem like there's much variety to each song, each song is VERY unique and it seems an equal amount of work went into each one. So that in turn tells me, No song could be released as a single, or EVERY song can be released as a single. <BR>To those who have never heard anything my Ministry before, I'd highly recommend listening to &quot;Mind is a Terrible Thing&quot; FIRST at least 2 times, then that'll show you what this band is all about, what they're trying to express. If you end up liking it, then you can pick up &quot;Psalm 69&quot; and it'll be the same band, but experimenting with their own sound and musical idea further, and most likely you will like this one too. <BR>Ministry is definitely very very original, and Al Jourgeson is definitly what I call an artist.

B000001FS3|5.0|I still like this as their best.
6302814782|5.0|Yes, it's a bit predictable. Yes, it was a showcase for teen-idol-cute-boy type stars. Having said that, it's really a great movie. Typical teen angst scenarios (my folks split up, I'm the new guy in town, I'm trying to impress the pretty girl who is more interested in the bad buys than me)are given a macabre twist with the revelation that the bad boys -- along with the pretty girl -- are \\"lousy bloodsuckers!\\" (movie quote, edited.)K. Sutherland does a fantastic job as the lead bad guy (with a momentary lapse with a tear for what he is...)Jason Patric is a troubled Jim Morrison doppleganger, and the two Corys are, honestly, hysterical as they try to save Santa Clara. The cinematography on some of the end scenes is really excellent. Is it a deep, thought provoking, heart wrenching film of love and loss? No. If you want that, go get Titanic. This is pure fun, with a bloody twist. Enjoy!
1573229725|5.0|I have read all three of Sarah's books, starting with Tipping the Velvet then Affinity and this 3rd book, Fingersmith. WOW is all i can say. Gripping and twisting plots, unexpected turns in the story but very workable. Her gift of dscribing everything down to the stench of London streets and the poverty of the day , the villians, the asylums, the powerful thoughts of the characters is brilliant.No 220 page book for this writer, certainly value for money and great great reading !!!! Im waiting impatiently for her next book.Better still someone make a movie of these books, they are excellent.
0385335482|5.0|This book is hilarious!  Sadly, I could relate to some of what was said (but I am not that bad!).  I could not put is down and I highly recommend it to anyone that ever bought something they couldn't afford or loves to shop.
B00006JDVV|1.0|This is one of those films that you sit and watch and say to yourself,&quot; Who was dumb enough to spend x millions of dollars to make this dud.&quot;  Other than the writing, direction, and acting, this is a fine film.  The dragons are cool so that's where the one star comes from.  With the stars in this film (who I won't embaress by naming) you wonder what happened to the plot.  There is no effort to get you to care about these characters and the dialogue that spills out of their mouth is laughable.  The premise of the movie is that dragons are discovered underground and then proceed to kick the butts of humans until one of the stars figures out a way to destroy them using the same weapons that mankind had around for the thirty years or so we were getting trounced.  I was willing to suspend disbelief, but the writing was so silly and the plot turns so contrived, I had to give up.  I am not sure who is to blame here but I am guessing it can be shared by the studio and the director.  It struck me as a film that got made by committee, and we all know how those often end up.  I am convinced one could make a very cool flick about modern day dragons, but I suspect it will be a long time before any studio ponies up the bucks for that concept.  The DVD has got good video and sound (try the DTS) and the extras...well who cares when the movie itself is so bad.
B000059XUO|5.0|\\"The Crow\\" staring Brandon Lee was released in 1993-94. It was a huge hit when it was released in theaters, but for some reason, kind of faded out as the years went by.  People soon completely forgot about \\"The Crow\\" and what a great movie it was. Now people these days have never even heard of it! <br />The story and plot are very basic and predictable, but somehow you find yourself liking it that way. The scenery is very dark and gothic like, somewhat like the original \\"Batman\\" movie, and at times--it is even darker.<br />The movie is about a musician, Eric Draven, and his fiance who are to be married on October 31st, Halloween. But the night before Halloween is even more dreaded in the city then Halloween night itself. Every night before Halloween, a gang of drug-dealers and killers run about the city and set fires to hundreds of buildings every year. This night is known to the city as \\"Devil's Night.\\"  This year, however, Eric and his fiance, Shelly, are victims and are brutually killed, the day before their wedding.<br />Legend has it though that if someone dies without peace, the soul cannot rest until it is fixed. People believe that if this happens, a crow can ressurect the body to set the wrong things right. So a year later, Eric is ressurrected and watched over by a crow to seek revenge on the gang that killed him and his fiance. <br />I'm not going to give away what happens throught the movie.  But I will tell you that this is one of the greatest films ever made. Brandon Lee was not noticed a lot before this movie so no body really knew of his acting abilities. Sadly, he was killed during the filming of this movie. He did a great job, and quite possibly, could have been one of the biggest stars to date if he were still alive. <br />\\"The Crow\\" is about 1 hour and 50 minutes. It is rated R for extreme violence and distruction, very strong language, some explicit drug content, and some brief sexual content. Definatly not reccomended for children under 15.
0451191153|5.0|This is a great book----It shows that individual fredom and liberty is under an assault by socialism.  This is an anti-socialist book and it speaks on the philosophical level-----the most scary to those who have bought communism/socialism.  When individuals are free to reject the rules of others liberty is attained.  When the group makes people conform it is bad.  istory shows this.

B000002LUB|4.0|In review to the person who said that if you liked \\"Strange Highways\\" this is for you. Well, just go back into the Dio catalog to the ELF days! Dio added a more commercial sound to Sabbath at that time. Granted, it's not one of the strongest albums from that period of Sabbath. Strange Highways was most horrible for Dio fans.

I love their music when they had Sid Barret, then when they had David Gilmore, and I even like thir music after Waters left.  Pulse males the listener feel like he is in the crowd and makes you wish that the band would tour again.  I get goose bumps every time I listen to the crowd sing a long to &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.  This is a definate must have.
0066214122|4.0|The more I read about the possibilities of the future, the more I embrace our past. Now it is nanotechnology which poses the threat and Michael Crichton has done with it as he has done with other similar themes, i.e. he makes terrible things sound reasonably possible. While I must admit this technology was not on my radar screen before I picked the book up, it surely is now and if you would like to spend some discomfiting time getting entertainingly educated, this is your opportunity.
B00006JIAF|4.0|I really like this CD.  It's catchy, fun and isn't brainless. &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; are infectious, but &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot; is the favorite. You only have to hear one or two songs of this band to know they know what they are doing.  As for the big hype about the band, I don't read the music mag and rarely watch MTV, so I wasn't aware of it.  I heard &quot;Last Nite&quot; on the radio and decided to give this CD a try.  All the songs are good independently, though they tend to sound all alike in first couple of hearings.  Overall the album definately has a great feel to it.  And best of all you will not be bored if you like any one of their songs.  Yes, the sound does remind me of Velvet Underground, Television, Ramons..but I can't say they are music of my generation.  No doubt the Strokes is influenced by these band just like my musical taste is influcenced by them.  You can borrow Velvet Underground and Nico or Marquee Moon CD from your older brother's collection and if you like what you hear, you should give this CD a try.
0553573403|4.0|But not of the caliber suggested by other reviewers on this site, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I started and finished this book in a reasonably short amount of time, and I would say it occupied my dreaming mind for a short spell or two while I wasn't reading it, but I fail to see the \\"epic\\" grandeur others seem to find within its pages.<br />The book is indeed rather dark, peppered with rape, violent murder, and other generally disgusting behaviors that, yes, may have been prevalent in feudal society. But how is this a redeeming feature? This is not a book of history, it is a book of fantasy. I don't necessarily mind that main characters get hewn down, children repeatedly get used and abused, and the plot just generally seems to go down a dark road, but I did find myself occasionally wishing for something nice to happen to someone.<br />I am not trying to be unfair to this book, as I have since picked up and quickly read its sequel. I can definitely say that I enjoy the narrative style of the book, which shifts from character to character, thereby seamlessly elaborating on what become multiple interesting plots and subplots. I enjoy the tidbits of magic and mystery, which in this book are merely harbingers of what's to come in later installments, I feel sure. And I find many of the characters well-drawn and interesting.<br />This is a solidly good book, and I enjoyed it, but I just wanted to add my voice here and indicate that I don't see it as the glowing piece of miraculous fiction others speak of. I do recommend it, but keep in mind that neither it nor its sequels offer many pleasant or uplifting plot turns.... so keep some other lighter fare at hand as well if you are, like me, a little on the empathic side. :)
B00006L9ZT|3.0|I've watched the Ring cycle live in the Metropolitan Opera in this very same production. To be frank, the Met's Ring cycle isn't one of its best productions - it's rather blandly directed and there're a few weak links in the cast, including some in the major roles.<br />Having now watched this DVD transcription, my impression remains largely the same. One of course misses on the TV screen the grandeur of the opera house, however, one can become more attentive to the details. Yet, on the whole, both the staging and the direction are still rather unimaginative. The cast that the Met has assembled isn't to notch, and they're not particularly good in acting, too.<br />The production is worth watching. But one shouldn't place high expectations on it. And also prepared some a few stretches of boring drama and disappointing direction on the way.
0553579908|4.0|And the second book, A Clash of Kings, is a great, fast read. Like other readers, I appreciate the complexity Martin lends his characters, and I think Tyrion, the Imp, is the most interesting character in the book-- simply because he is the conduit through which we learn of much of the action in the book, which centers around the intrigues at King's Landing (where he seems to be the only figure with any moral tendencies at all). I also enjoy that some of the foreshadowed developments are finally beginning to take place, i.e., the rediscovery of elements of magic in the world, what with Daenerys with her dragons and the delving into what mysteries lie behind the Wall in the north (after a disappointingly long time without any information about the mysterious \\"Others\\", who, alas, aren't really that elaborated on in this installment either)<br />However, I want to point out to all those interested in comparing this series to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, or to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, that the comparisons of \\"realistic\\" or \\"fast-paced\\" versus \\"prosaic\\" or \\"stilted\\" do not necessarily sum things up. I am not, by the way, agreeing, as I adore Tolkien, and have enjoyed the Wheel of Time series. I would simply point out that the main point of difference here is that we are reading in the Song of Fire and Ice series what seems to be a story about essentially human conflict, which takes shape in a very convoluted, complex, unfailingly grey-shaded world. Tolkien and Jordan write, on the other hand, about very black and white, metaphysically important conflicts. In Wheel of Time or The Lord of the Rings, what is at stake is the universe itself and \\"life as we know it\\". Reality is under attack. In Martin's world, what is at stake? Well, the stewardship of the land. Yes, the conflict does mean life or death to many of its characters, but not to the whole of humanity or existence (at least yet, it's not been finished yet). <br />So, there is a point to keep in mind. It is not in any way a failing of this series, it is rather a strength, as you can see from the many reviewers who would rather read about a gripping, human struggle than some striving that takes them away from the human plane and toys with metaphysical ideas of reality. I myself prefer the more idealized versions, but I will definitely give A Clash of Kings a solid 4-star rating as a very enjoyable read, and I look forward to picking up the next book in this series.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is the best movie no one has seen.  The theatrical release had zero promotion, and was only a \\"limited-release\\", however, Christian Bale, Emily Watson, Sean Bean, and Taye Diggs all deliver excelent performances.  It is my fervent hope that the DVD will become as big of an \\"underground\\" hit as The Boondock Saints.  Now, as the other reviewers on this site will tell you, it is very easy to make assumptions about this film in comparison to The Matrix.  Yes, these films are both action films.  Yes, they both show distopic futures.  No, this is not a Matrix clone.  Give it a try.  When you love it, as I know you will, show it to your friends.  Make them buy it.  Make them show it to their friends.  This movie is awesome.  Period.
B00005JLKN|5.0|this movie kicked soooo much ...!! i was on the edge of my seat tho whole time. besides that, edward norton is the sexxiest man alive. i think this is by far the best movie dealing with hannibal lector & it is one of my favorite movies!!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem is truly in his prime on this record. His rhymes as well as those of his collaborators are very very good, and the beats are very appropriate. Very few hip hop artists can match the intensity seen on songs like \\"Kim\\" or \\"The Way I Am\\". And if you share his sense of humor, tracks such as \\"Amityville\\", \\"Kill You\\", or \\"Remember Me?\\" will make your sides ache. I was also impressed when I learned that he played guitar on som of his songs (\\"Marshall Mathers\\" comes to mind). In my opinion, this is one of the best albums of this generation; definitely worth a listen to say the least.
B00000HYXB|5.0|When I first popped this Cd into my stereo, I thought, \\"hey, this is kind of cool\\" now, after almost three weeks of non-stop listening, I am hooked.  I bought this album because i am a HUGE fan of LOTR and Middle Earth, and enjoyed their Lord of the Rings song immensely.  I was not a power metal fan, and I was a bit uneasy buying a CD from a group that was referred to \\"as the gods\\" of this genre.  Nonetheless, I bought it.<br />I was stunned at the complexity of their music, and the depth of their lyrics.  This album puts all of the modern musicians to shame for writing pathetically predictable songs.  If these men had been alive five hundred years ago, they would have surely been the greatest of the Bards.  These artist are defiantly my top pick for the greatest word wizards of modern time.<br />I enjoyed everything about this album (even the narration.  it makes the CD seem more epic, and helps those not familiar with Tolkein to understand the meaning of the discs)  Here are some of my favorite Highlights:<br />War Of Wrath:  This is the first track on the Cd and is one of the greatest \\"talking tracks\\" on the entire CD.  It sets the dark overtone of the CD by introducing the main villains in the story.  from the sound of the elves breaking the gates, to the evil Morgoths voice, this track will grab you from the start.<br />Into the Storm:  Don't let the sometimes Nintendo sounding guitars fool you, this is a song worth listening too.  its catchy lyrics are a great intro into the BG feel.<br />Nightfall:  Defiantly my favorite song on the entire CD.  Going from a peaceful beginning to the anger filled climax, this shows the talent of this group in making great music.  Mt one friend called this \\"heavy bard music\\" and i agree with him.  after a few listens, you hear the different \\"actors\\" and feel the drama.  I would have bought the CD for this track alone, but there are so many other tracks that I could say this about.<br />Blood Tears:  One of the slower songs in the CD.  A nice contrast, but not for long.  This piece has some of the angriest lyrics in the piece.  Awesome chorus.<br />Mirror Mirror:  Sure to be a classic in its own right.  This song has an interesting feel to it, while not one of my favorites, this song is a favorite of all of my metal fan friends.<br />Noldor (dead winter reigned):  Another classic!  This is my second favorite song out of the entire CD (after Nightfall).  The lyrics are very sad and sometimes depressing, but you cant help but sing the chorus.<br />Time Stands still (at the iron hill):  A battle song.  This is another song that has multiple \\"actors\\" in it.  Awesome chorus and interludes.  You can feel the battle surging around you, and see the heroic elf king battle the treacherous Morgoth.<br />Thorn:  I think this song captures the essence of the elves.  They know that all is hopless, and that they will lose, yet they fight on.  Tolkein called it \\"the long defeat\\" and that is how BG portrays it.<BR>\\"Let us march on<BR>Though there's no hope at our side<BR>Let us be brave<BR>Though by glory we are denied\\"<br />The Eldar:  By far the slowest song on the entire CD.  Another great example of how talented this band is.  Although some metal purists may not like this song (it is basically a piano and a singer) it shows the range of this truly unusual band.  You also hear the range of the singer, from his falsetto to his high pitched screams.  This guy can hit notes that I have never heard a many reach before.<br />There are many other great songs, but these are my favorites.  This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard, and I recommend it to ANYONE who enjoys: fantasy, metal, great lyrics/story, or anyone who wants to hear what music should be, full of emotion and meaningful.  Also, in the back of the cover, there are several small monologues that follow the same theme as the CD.  They are awesome as well.  I recommend this musical masterpiece to anyone.  It made me a fan of metal, and I can'twait to order my next CD.
0451196716|4.0|When I first read this book, I thought this would be one of King's worst works due to the rumors he had lost his touch, but I learned i was very wrong.As soon as I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The concept of the walk is defiently an amazing idea the King has come up with, and puts out a very powerful message to the reader about... nah, just figure it out for yourself. BE SURE TO READ IT, OR YOU DEFIENTLY WILL MISS OUT ON A GREAT BOOK.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD stands in place with the great records in my collection that have stood the test of time.  Dylan, the Stones, the Who, Springsteen, the Clash, Talking Heads, the Replacements, Steve Earle, etc etc.. OK Computer is in that league.  <br />Notice there's no Pink Floyd on that list?  Pink Floyd is an inapt comparison to this band.   Radiohead has all the imagination that Gilmour &amp; co had but none of the false pretense; there's not a gratuitous note on this CD.  This album, as others have noted, is about dehumanization and disconnectedness in modern society.  That doesn't mean that this is dehumanized music.. quite the opposite, in fact.  These songs are as passionate and humanistic (and, in their own subtle way, even explosive) as the best work of The Clash or U2.<br />But don't let all these comparisons fool you:  Radiohead is its own band with its own unique and inventive sound.  Unlike their earlier CDs, this one takes a few listens too set its hook.  But don't be surprised to find yourself in the shower one morning singing in falsetto &quot;where you are... where you are..&quot;
B00003CXE7|5.0|Most people who do not enjoy this movie are those who are too dense to realize its depth and mastery or those who become easily bored.  However, any true movie critic knows that behind this title, is a story with heart and mind to it.  In my opinon, I believe that Russell Crowe gave one of his most outstanding performances ever, aside to The Insider.  The battle and fight scenes are simply amazing, but I also found the story to hold true genuity.  Quite simply put, this is one of the best modern-day films around...watch it.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|... I can't. I don't know what to say... this album is simply that amazing. 19 songs of pure excellence... not just a worthy follow-up to the selftitled, but quite possibly the best rock album ever recorded. Perhaps the gorgeous sarcasm of &quot;The Right Profile&quot; or the anti pure-capitalistic rocker &quot;Koka Kola&quot; can say what needs to be told for me. ... I guess I'll just stop here. Prepare to enjoy this record, if you're just purchasing it now... I know you will (enjoy it).
0793927501|5.0|This movie is well written and carried out. The film shots and scenery in Alaska are wonderful. Anthony Hopkins is such a convincing actor. I don't use the word &quot;excellent&quot; too often - but his performances in most things he does are truly excellent.<br />What I liked most about this movie was the journey that Hopkins' character was on. He learned about himself and others and I believe became closer to fulfillment. We are all on this journey, and I think when things get tough true character is what separates people. In this movie it was evident that &quot;character was king&quot;. <br />The interview at the end and the response by the person being interviewed is my favorite line - buy the movie to see it!<br />My second favorite character is the bear! What a face!
0440237688|5.0|The Giver... um how do I start? Well my teacher assinged us books to read and i was assigned this one. When i first got this i didnt think it would be that good but i soon leared wrong. Lois Lowery is the best author and like all the other books she has written they keep you guessing. This book is so good you cant stop reading.It really teaches that you dont really know things til you live them. it is ssooooooooo good it really is a story of determineation and love. So i strongly advise you to read this!!!!!!!!
B000001IPL|5.0|Hard to believe that it's been almost a decade since the Offspring released what was to become their best work, \\"Smash\\". Brewing with Dexter Holland's so-cal voice, clever lyrics, and nice all-around punk energy, Smash represents the prime of one of the Epitaph labels best bands.<br />But to label the Offspring as just another Epitaph band would be wrong. This is a punk album, make no mistake about it, but if you're looking for something along the lines of noFX, Randcid, or Pennywise, you might be in the wrong place.<br />Not to say that \\"Smash\\" isn't up to par with \\"Punk In Drublic\\", \\"...And Out Come The Wolves\\", and \\"About Time\\", but it definetly has a sound of it's own when compared to those three.<br />If I could, I'd rather give this 4 1/2 stars, but unfortunatly, Amazon.com only allows me a 4 or a 5 so I'll go with the latter, because though it's not exactly a 5 star CD, it's definetly not a 4 star. Here's a quick track by track listing.<br />1. Time To Relax: Simple introduction. Kind of pointless, but it's not bad as far as introductions go.<br />2. Nitro: Very fast and energetic track. It sets the tone for the rest of the album very well. As the chorus states, it's about \\"living like there's no tomorrow\\".<br />3. Bad Habit: Like many other Offspring songs about serious subjects, Bad Habit's take on road rage is surprisingly up tempo (save the first 50 seconds or so, and somewhat comical.<br />4. Gotta Get Away: Arguably the best track on the CD. Very nice, but somewhat slow and monotonous. Still manages to have one of the best choruses ever. It's about a person suffering from paranoia.<br />5. Genocide: Fast song. One of several on here dealing with political issues. As the title suggests, it's about genocide. \\"Dog Eat Dog, every day, on our fellow men we pray\\".<br />6. Something To Believe In: Self explanatory. One of the more pointless songs on the album. It sounds almost exactly like all the songs around it.<br />7. Come Out And Play: The unreleased single turned hit. For a song about gang-violence, it's surprisingly up tone and seems better suited for a party than such a serious issue.<br />8. Self Esteem: At this point you reach the peak of the CD (although Smash helps bring it back to that level near the end). Come Out And Play and Self Esteem might be the two best songs on the CD and they come right after each other. It's about a guy being abused in a relation ship.<br />9. It'll Be a Long Time: Yet another political song. Deals with how world leaders may never set aside their differences for the greater benefit of all.<br />10. Killboy Powerhead: About as significant as the title leads you to believe.<br />11. What Happened To You: Poppiest song on the album. Deals with a guy's best friend turning into a druggy before his eyes and him not being able to help him. Once again however, very uptone for a serious subject.<br />12. So Alone: Quick fast, swearing. It wasn't meant to be anything deeply meaningful, and it doesn't have to. It's great just the way it is.<br />13. Not The One: Voice of a generation. Scoffs at youth being labeled as causing the problems in society while so many of the worlds problems were caused by past generations.<br />14. Smash: As good as any of the other songs on this album. In my opinion the best. An anthem for all of those who don't fit in and don't care what the \\"mall-ratts\\" think about them. I'm sure that if it wasn't for the constant swearing, this would've been their first single.<br />So there you have it. The Offsprings Smash. Very good, but not Great. But still, good enough that I'd recommend it to you. Check it out. You won't regret it.
0884271536|2.0|This book is as painful to read as The Goal is delightful.  As the old saying goes, &quot;If you've got a good thing, you might as well beat it into the ground.&quot;  Can we consider a critical path in a project similar to a bottleneck?  Sure; now let's move on to bigger and better things.<br />The writing is third rate and the application isn't enough of an extension of The Goal to lead the reader through the number of pages offered.  Between thumbing his nose at academics, big business and anyone else he's been slighted by, Goldratt forgets that his primary mission is to let the reader in on his secrets of project management.  If you can't check it out from your public library, then you're better off not bothering with it.

B00006F83Y|5.0|I can't say enough about how good this cd is...and, oh yes my longing for the days of Soundgarden have finally been put to rest (No ill feelings towards Chris Cornell or Audioslave intended).  It's hard to describe the style of music this band plays, which is one thing that makes it so good. I suppose the best definition is hard rock (alternative would do as well)--be that at it may, the songs are interesting, original, and catchy all at the same time.  When's the last time you ran into that??  I like the jabs they take at the current state of radio in the U.S.  (thank God for the local Jazz station and NPR) and the bland, overplayed oldy rock that we mostly get to hear (Man I loved Led Zepplin and  Aerosmith in their day too, but enough already).  So, get this album, enjoy rock at it's finest and give a sigh of relief that there are still bands like this one that give us hope for rock music's future.
B00006F1IJ|4.0|Like a lot of people who went on to become big fans of Acoustic Alchemy, I first heard songs from \\"Natural Elements\\" on the radio in the late 80's. In those days, they were a guitar act first and foremost, a beautiful combination of nylon string and steel string acoustic guitars, with all of the other instruments very much in supporting roles. As the years went by and the albums kept coming, they developed a much lusher, very produced, sound and the guitars were not so much their raison d'etre. This album has a good sampling of both the early and the late eras.<br />I would say that one of the defining characteristics of Acoustic Alchemy's music is how well it holds up over time. I have listened to Red Dust and Spanish Lace and Natural Elements literally hundreds of times and they are as fresh and exciting today as the first time I ever heard them. To my mind, the later albums are spottier, two or three great tracks and the rest just good. I think this is particularly true since the death of founding member Nick Webb. <br />So, if you don't know Acoustic Alchemy, this album would be a very good introduction. If you like what you hear, I suggest you pick up one or more of their first three albums, Red Dust and Spanish Lace, Natural Elements or Blue Chip. If you love what you hear, try some of the later albums - I would say Reference Point, although others might disagree - just be aware that it's a very different band and sound on those albums.
B00005JLZL|2.0|\\"The Life of David Gale\\" is an equal opportunity offender in that it makes both those who support and those who oppose the death penalty look equally venal, conniving and foolish.  I don't think that was the INTENTION of writer Charles Randolph and director Alan Parker - since the theme of the film is based on the premise that an innocent man can indeed be falsely executed - but that is the unfortunate impression we are left with once the bizarre plot twists and convolutions have played themselves out.<br />It is four days before David Gale (Kevin Spacey), an ex-college professor convicted of raping and killing a female colleague (Laura Linney), is scheduled for execution.  The twist is that Gale used to be one of the most vocal opponents against capital punishment in all of Texas, and now he is on Death Row.  Catch the irony?  Gale has decided to open up to a single reporter, \\"Bitsey\\" Bloom (Kate Winslet), in an attempt to have her go out and prove his innocence, if not for his own sake, at least for the sake of his young son.  The film becomes a typical race-against-time melodrama with Bitsey and her cohort, intern reporter Zack (Gabriel Mann), piecing together the clues as to what actually happened on that fateful day years earlier, in an effort to stave off the inevitable while the clock ticks down and the wheels of Texas justice grind inexorably on.<br />\\"The Life of David Gale\\" is a reasonably entertaining thriller provided you don't apply too much common sense or logic to the matters at hand.  In fact, the film's admittedly absurd plot contrivances do manage to keep us guessing most of the way through.  Spacey, Winslet and Linney give it their all, even if that means occasionally going over the top to match the overheated nature of the material they have to work with.  My biggest complaint with the film is that the overly clever denouement, though it serves its purpose as an acceptable \\"shocker,\\" really undercuts the entire film we have just sat through since it turns Gale into a complete and utter liar in terms of everything he has said up to that point.  What purpose is served by having him pour out this tale of innocence to Bitsey if he knows she is going to find out the truth later on anyway?  It's really a case of a convicted man inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on an innocent party who just wants to help him.  (Protecting the son's memory of him seems a tenuous reason at best).  Besides, the duplicity underlying the abolitionists' actions would more likely turn the general public AGAINST their cause than win it many new converts.  Even though the filmmakers' sympathies obviously lie with those upholding the anti-capital punishment position, the \\"sincere\\" protestors depicted in the film don't always seem like the sharpest tools in the shed.<br />\\"The Life of David Gale\\" has its moments as social drama fantasy, but for a real, serious study of the death penalty issue, check out the great \\"Dead Man Walking\\" instead.ce it turns Gale into a complete and utter liar in terms of everything he has said up to that point.

0316666343|3.0|This novel is one I would recommend to a friend with some hesitation.  It starts off with a portrait of family pain so crisp and expertly written that your own heart and gut will feel the wound.  However, that novel with its dramatic realism and captivating portraits (Susie, Lindsey and their Dad) veers off into a landscape I disliked:  the characters of Mr.Harvey and Abigail are essentially not well-described and the tone for both is indefinite.  But the real flaw of the book is an ending ... that reads as tacked on, almost compulsively Cheerful. It is a false cheer and the opposite of the rest of the book.  Nevertheless, this book is a cultural touchstone now and it is fun to argue over.  Overall, a good book but not a great one.
B0000683DH|5.0|The Star Trek films are among my top favorites in the science fiction genre, and the Director's Edition release of The Wrath of Khan tops my list as my favorite Trek film of all time.  Conceived as a sequel to the Original Series episode &quot;Space Seed&quot;, The Wrath of Khan is a story about the adventures of Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and the rest of the Enterprise crew as they attempt to stop genetically engineered 20th-Century madman Khan (played by the ever-delightful Ricardo Montalban) from using a stolen top-secret device called Project Genesis to ignite universal Armageddon in his quest for revenge against Kirk.<br />The thing I enjoyed most about the Director's Edition was the inclusion of several scenes that had been filmed for the movie, but which were cut in the theatrical release.  One of these is a scene between Kirk and Peter Preston (Ike Eisenmann) that serves to define the relationship between Preston and Scotty (James Doohan).  While it was ultimately deemed unnecessary to the plot, it helped clarify certain reactions from Scotty later in the film.  There are also some extended scenes with Dr. Carol Marcus (played by the late Bibi Besch), her son David (the late Merritt Butrick), and the crew of Space Station Regula One which serve a similar purpose.<br />I also liked the fact that the Director's Edition had enough extras to warrant the inclusion of a second disc, which is a rarity from Paramount.  The Feature disc has a spoken commentary by director Nicholas Meyer (while I'm not normally a fan of these types of commentaries because they distract me, I enjoyed hearing what Meyer had to say about the film) and a text commentary by Star Trek Encyclopedia author Michael Okuda.  The Special Features disc includes some very insightful interviews with Meyer, Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and writer/Executive Producer Harve Bennett, as well as two featurettes (Designing Khan and The Visual Effects of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan), original interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and the late DeForest Kelley, and plenty more.

B000063V8U|4.0|Well I love TNG but I won't give another list of my fav episodes. But I will tell you, the packaging of these box sets is much better in the Region 2 version. Also, the region 2 sets are a virtual Rosetta stone with audio tracks in German, English, Spanish, French, and Italian, an astonish 10 languages in subtitles: Danish, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish. Kind of like a univeral translater, you might say.  And to top it all off, even with the declining dollar, the Region 2 sets are cheaper.  So if you've got a region-free player, skip the us version and get the R2.
0140042520|4.0|Kerouac has often been forced into a narrow paradigm in which to work.  The casual reader delights in reading about Kerouac and Snyder climbing the Matterhorn; the same holds true for Teh Kerouac/ Cassady relationship in On the Road.  Still I think that the underlying truths of this book, which lie dormant to the casual reader, greatly outshine the aciton.  <BR>Kerouac's prose aims to draw the reader away from the worldly cycle of Work-Consume-Work-Consume and so on.  He aims to show us a different path, one for the people who meditate and defy social convention, not simply for the sake of defiance, but for the sake of self-enlightenment.  <BR>The long-haired, tea smoking, judge killing, terrorist supporting outsiders of today, so villified by the present and past governments, find in Kerouac much overlooked philosophy a separate peace, one away from the wired up fast paced world of dead technology.  When Kerouac goes on his long beautiful tangents about children singing a ditty of their own imagination, it's like being eight years old again and having ice cream and cookies in the kitchen and laughing about the nonsense that happened at school that day.  Kerouac reminds us that we do not live in a world enclosed by the suggested rule of society, that we are each our own to create and experience what we will for ourselves.  <BR>TTFN<BR>Dr. Gonzo
B000002HAJ|5.0|i enjoyed this cd rather much.  i first got into the cure after i fell in love with the crow, and read many stories about james o barr and his inspirations for creating such a magnificant series, and one of his inspirations was the cure, so the first cd i bought was disintegration.  i remember friday im in love, so i picked up this cd, and however i feel the best listening experience is &quot;the edge of the deep green sea&quot;<br />&quot;i wish that i could stop, i know another moment will break my heart.  too many tears, too many times, too many years i cried for you...&quot;<br />the cure is music you can get lost in.  robert smith is by far one of the most talented songwriters ive ever known.
B00006F7S4|2.0|I have long been a Beck fan, but as many times as I tried to get into this album, I just couldn't.  There are about four or five songs that are good or great, but the rest of the CD just fails to get the blood flowing.  As a whole, the lyrics may be worthwhile, but the lyrics can't carry the too slow, too uninteresting melodies.
B0000635NG|5.0|The stupid reviewer below me who doesn't know why this \\"junk\\" is selling should take a hint from all the Grammys she won! All of the tracks on this album are excellent and they all come together splendidly to create one immensely enjoyable CD, and What Am I To You? is a great non-commercial track available on this disc only.<br />Here is my review of the standard disc:<br />This debut is unspeakably outstanding. Norah is the best new artist to come out in 2002; she is neck-and-neck with Avril Lavigne. Make no mistake of course, their music is very different. (Incidentally, I bought both their albums the same day.) Norah's amazing voice permeates this exquisite album; she has the absolute best voice to emerge in the music industry for a very long time. It is descriptive and lush, relentlessly upbeat while at the same time beautifully laid back and relaxed. Her band is also wonderfully fresh-sounding, making this album likable even by fans of acoustic folk rock. Jones ebbs in and out of excellent new songs written by other artists for her, excellent new songs written by herself (including the outstanding title track), as well as fantastic standards such as the outstanding closing track THE NEARNESS OF YOU. Other excellent highlights include FEELIN THE SAME WAY \\"Another day that I can't find my head My feet don't look like they're my own I try and find the floor below to stand I hope I reach it once again\\", SEVEN YEARS \\"Fragile as a leaf in autumn falling to the ground without a sound Crooked little smile on her face tells a tale of grace that's all her own\\", and NIGHTINGALE \\"Tell me your tale Was your journey far too long Does it seem like I'm looking for an answer To a question I can't ask I don't know which way the feather falls If I should blow it to the left\\". Of course, all the songs are excellent here; there is no filler, but I thought I'd just give you a taste of what YOU SHOULD be purchasing. Don't purchase this album at your own risk is all I have to say.
B00005YW4H|4.0|At last.  A new voice that's worth hearing.  Come Away with Me by Norah Jones is well worth the money you'll lay down to have it.  New compositions by Norah  include the cover title Come Away With Me and Nightingale certainly blend well with the more well known songs by Hoagy Carmichael and Hank Williams and others.  The overall experience is restful with just enough melody to keep the ears interested.  Jones voice is familiar at one time and completely new at others.  What an experience.<br />Negative criticism of this CD is unwarranted.  Most artistic endeavors need time to massage the soul.  It takes time to become a classic and not all classics are immediately recognized.  Read some to the reviews of Aaron Copeland's music and you'll see what I mean.  Critics of the day couldn't see beyond their noses.  Read reviews of any Faulkner book written by his contemporaries; same deal.  If you hear it and like it then enjoy it.  Norah Jones will become a great artist and the CD Come Away with Me will become a classic; a wonderful first effort.
B00005JM1D|1.0|What does a mild-mannered thirty-year-old businessman do after he catches the early flight home and discovers his woman in a sado-masochistic tryst?  Why, the same thing you and I would, of course--he starts a fraternity!  All those New Age philosophers who think the key to manhood lies in the \\"inner child\\" have found their cinematic manifesto in this bomb.  Stuffed start to finish with farcical crudity and tasteless \\"jokes,\\" \\"Old School\\" caters to that inexplicably loud & proud American caste that believes sobriety and responsibility are the great evils of society and that everything is okay as long as you can make it to the next party.  Unfunny and offensive, \\"Old School\\" is a sad waste of celluloid.
6305508550|4.0|For anyone who has ever worked in a cubicle farm, this is a must see movie!  You will find painfully real examples of work life that are skewered marvelously by Judge and crew.<br />When this film was first release, I don't recall it even managed a blip on the radar screen.  Thankfully, DVD/Video release gave this film much-needed exposure. <br />My favorite performance is Gary Cole as the boss, Lundberg.  He has the corporate clone down to a T, and he perfectly embodies the boss who knows nothing but how to navigate corporate politics.  And Stephen Root is a scene steeler as Milton.  <br />The DVD, on the other hand, is just a DVD.  No extras to make it worth your while.  I recommend renting until it's re-released. (And films this popular generally are).  It's too good a cult film for Judge and Co. to ignore this, and I can only imagine how worthwhile the deleted scenes would be.
B00000DC10|5.0|Like the album very much one of the best I ever heard. Listend to Machine Heads song &quot;Nothing Left&quot; on the Burning Red album just nu and fond out that is very similar to the Refused song &quot;New Noise&quot; on this album. Anyone else who heared this similarty, also checked the release dates on these two albums Refused released in 98 and Machine Heads album in 99,
0671781383|5.0|I re-read Man's Search for Meaning after my mother passed away.  She had suffered in her final month, and had left me and my siblings without a mother at a fairly young age.  Being able to think about the meaning of one's life, the purpose of suffering, and the spiritual drive that transcends us was very comforting.  I now realize that every challenge I face is a new test, and every time I pass the test I can become a stronger human with more gifts to give.<br />As much as Frankl's message, I also appreciate his brevity.  Many would have been compelled to write a 1000 page tome, but Frankl kept it brief and to the point.  Because of that, I think each word carries even more significance.<br />If you haven't read this book, it should be the next one on your list.

B00006RIO7|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this CD. The whole tone follows that of the movie, running from upbeat finger tapping tunes to slower thought provoking options. However, I think the Queen Latifah rap tune with Li'l Kim and Macy Gray could have been done without. While Queen Latifah really belts out \\"When You're Good To Mama\\", the rap just doesn't fit this CD. The Anastacia song is a nice \\"pop\\" sounding tune, but really doesn't belong here either. That said, those are the only 2 down notes on an otherwise stellar CD.  A DEFINATE BUY!
B00005JLRR|2.0|I went to see the latest STTNG movie looking forward to seeing the characters again. The movie started well with the wedding scene and some nice moments with the Next Generation characters.<BR>But that was it for from then on it became a \\"Die-Hard\\" style of film with little characterization or plot,and the plot made no sense. Why would a police-state like the Romulans possibly allow a human to rule them? How come he's got a ship that no-one else can match?Where did they get the idea that Shinzon looks like Picard? They don't look alike at all and in fact Shinzon looks kind of strange. The photo of Picard as a young man looks ludicrous,it does not look like him at all.<BR>And why destroy Data,Star Trek's most appealing character?<BR>This was a huge mistake. By doing this,they turned the film's triumph into a very flat end to the film.<BR>This was unnecessary and copied ST:The Wrath Of Khan,only not as well done.<br />The big problem with this film is that it doesn't have a heart,it is just an action film,nothing more. STTNG was a warm hearted family series and this is where Nemesis fails. Nemesis is just a cold hard action film. I much prefer the previous Trek film in ST:Insurrection because that film retains the warm-hearted philosophy that the cold ST:Nemesis lacks.<BR>And there is another Trek character that isn't treated with much respect,the Enterprise itself. Is there anyone out there that can't penetrate the security of the Enterprise? Once again,the shields fail and to top this off the ship runs out of ammo after one battle. ...<br />Would it be too much for fans to ask that Rick Berman make one Star Trek film where the Enterprise is shown to be a strong ship?<BR>It would be a Star Trek fans dream if they could make it so.<BR>Just imagine a STTNG film where they say \\"the shields have held captain\\".\\"They did not penetrate our security captain\\" or \\"we have outgunned them captain\\". How about just one film where the Enterprise takes on an enemy ship and actuallywins the battle?<BR>The Enterprise is a main character,weaken it and you weaken the film.<br />And for the second time in a row,the incomparable ILM has not done the effects for a Star Trek film. Why not?<BR>...<BR>The Film Galaxy Quest used ILM and their effects were superior to the last two STTNG films.
B000002GJH|4.0|If the early-90's Seattle scene (I am NOT gonna use the G-word here!) had a soft side, this disc is probably the best example of that.  Of course we all know that most of this band eventually became Pearl Jam, but here it was just Andrew Wood's former bandmates and his ex-roommate eulogizing him on record.<br />And quite a nice record it is.
156224003X|5.0|This book is great as it has helped me realize why i play the trumpet and helps me drop any ego i have. I enjoy playing the trumpet and it is truly easier to sit down and just practice something now because of the books great view points and explanations. great book for any musician

B00005JKZT|5.0|even, after reading the books, so many times I have them memorized, I still sat there in awe and wondered how the heck they would manage to survive the battle of helm's deep. If a movie can do that to me with a story I know so well, I have to believe it is one of the best fantasy movies I have ever seen.<BR>I can't wait for the extended version to come out on DVD!
B000003B6J|1.0|This CD is absolutely deplorable but will unfortunately appeal to like-minded yobs.  These young ruffians brag about inexcusable acts of violence and the dubious manner in which they earn their income as if they are proud of it. As a highly successful lawyer (double first from Oxford) I for one have managed to 'get paid' without having to resort to such thuggery and am quite appalled by the behaviour of these vicious brutes who should know better (one of them is a qualified doctor!). Check out Will Smith's Greatest Hits if you want to hear some quality rap music.
B00007G207|5.0|The New Version is great.  The added scenes in which Toto meets his teenage love, Elena, are wonderful and add a soulful richness that was lacking in the US version.  The resolution of their relationship completes the film as a whole and makes the final scene where Toto watches the missing kissing scenes even that more powerful.  The film is filled with such a warmth and genuine feeling of nostalgia; like so many great Italien films, this movie is very moving and touching on many levels.  Simply put, this is a great film watching experience.  The DVD transfer is excellent; it is extremely sharp, and the color is rich and very natural.  If you loved the US version released in 1989, I highly recommend getting this expanded version.  You will not be disappointed at all; just make sure you have a box of Kleenex for the ending!
0553573403|4.0|Well, what can I say?  This book is a truly brilliant package of paper and ink.  Unlike a lot of authors who invent their own worlds, Martin has used a wide vocabulary to create this fantasy world so that it is very believable.  We as the readers can connect with the actions of several of the characters and also with the setting because it is so like our own history, yet not exactly.<br />  It was heart breaking what happened to Eddard Stark.  I nearly cried.  I found the incestuous relationship between Cersei and Jaime Lannister somewhat disturbing, especially since they have three children together and having sex was something that they had chosen to do.  I mean if they had some sort of custom to inbreed like the Targaryens then I might not be so disgusted.<br />  I enjoyed Martin's detailed descriptions for the most part, but was it really necessary to give us the low down on what everybody who made an entrance was wearing?  I think not.  Did we have to be privy to every pissing break that a character made?  I definitely think not.<br />  Don't be intimidated by the size of this book.  Once you get into it, it's really not that long because the story grabs onto you and never lets go.  You could be like me who skipped all the chapters having to do with the dragon queen, Daenerys (or however you spell the dumb name).  I gather I did not miss much in doing this from other reviews that I've read.  Besides, reading about a fourteen-year-old girl who has sex with and gets pregnant by her barbaric, late twenty-something-year-old husband<br />does not appeal to me.  That's not sexy.<br />  This book does not disappoint.  It's got everything:  drama, adventure, action, romance (I guess), mystery (though minimal),<br />and a small look at the fantasy monsters to come in the next two books.  So enjoy.<br />C&iacute;ao,<br /> Rahil
B00005Q66T|5.0|I just bought this album the other day, and I must say that I was not disappointed!  While this album doesn't include &quot;This Used To Be my Playground&quot; or &quot;I'll Remember&quot;, that doesn't matter because I already own &quot;Something to Remember&quot;.  I have been a Madonna fan for longer than I can remember, but this album is special to me because I can remember when these songs were new. I can remember hearing &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot; on the radio incessantly.  I love this album, even if it isn't in chronological order.  It leaves out some songs, but so did &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;.  These are only minor problems when you look at the album overall.  If you are a Madonna fan, you must buy this album. I'm also excited about her forthcoming new album!
B00005MP58|2.0|By all means buy A&Es exceptionally delightful production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but do NOT get this Special Edition DVD.  As others have rightfully pointed out the image quality is so poor that it's difficult to watch.  Washed out colors, grainy resolution, blurriness, contrast problems, and uneven sound quality all contributed to a disappointing and, in all honesty, annoying experience.<br />I watched \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" on television when it was originally aired.  I immediately bought the VHS set and enjoyed it immensely.  Then I purchased the Laserdisc version (so that I'd have a copy of P&P that would hold up given how many times I like to watch it) and again saw no degradation of quality, in fact the Laserdisc format provided better picture quality than the VHS format.  Therefore, I'm comparing this DVD edition to those I've already seen and it definitely lacks!  As much as I would like to have the series in the widescreen format I'll be returning my copy for a refund, and I'm going to wait and see if a better edition is produced.  This one does not offer the high quality visuals that this high quality production deserves.
B000069AUI|5.0|you know, i just got this CD a day ago and i'm already CRAZY about it, it's one of the best rock CD's i've ever listened to or owned, excepting Dave Matthews Band and Phish of course.  But anyway, i was especially spurred to get this CD when i saw their Grammy performance, it was unbeliveable that he(the lead singer/piano player) could be in to his music that much, with that much intensity. It's quite refreshing to see that enthusiasm in musicians today in this age of pop and meaningless music.  So if you were at all convinced by this amazing Grammy performance of the first track on the album, &quot;Politik&quot;, then i suggest you buy this album.
0792837614|5.0|Let me start off by saying that of all the musicals I've ever seen, West Side Story will always be my favorite. I first watched it in one of the high school English classes, and have been hooked ever since. The cast of the movie is incredible, with Natalie Wood as Maria, Richard Beymer as Tony, Rita Moreno as Anita, and George Chakiris as Bernardo. But the actor that I'm most impressed with is one that is hardly ever mentioned. Russ Tamblyn plays Riff, the leader of the Jets and Tony's best friend. He puts so much passion and life into Riff, that it broke my heart when he died. Also this musical has some great songs in it. Whether the characters are singing about love, (Tonight, Somewhere) agrueing about where life is better, (America) or just making fun of the adults, (Gee Officer Krupke)the characters bring it all to life. I would recommend this musical to anyone who is in the mood for a great movie about love and life, and bring a hankie, trust me, you'll need it

B00007L4MJ|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3MV5Q4YZTWK5G]]**1/5/13: ADDED REVIEW OF 2011 KINO \\"GIORGIO MORODER PRESENTS METROPOLIS\\" BLU-RAY (ASIN: B005J7K964) AND DVD (ASIN: B005J7K950) **<br /><br />**12/9/10: ADDED REVIEW OF 2010 KINO \\"THE COMPLETE METROPOLIS\\" BLU-RAY (ASIN: B0040QYROK) AND DVD (ASIN: B0040QYROA)**<br /><br />**12/9/10: ADDED REVIEW OF 2010 REGION-B EUREKA \\"METROPOLIS\\" BLU-RAY (Amazon UK ASIN: B0041SMF50)**<br /><br />**2/24/03: REVIEW OF 2003 KINO \\"METROPOLIS\\" DVD (ASIN: B00007L4MJ)<br /><br />I'm lumping my reviews together, just like what Amazon is doing!  The above 4 video editions of the German silent classic will be covered in this review.  Also, see my video clip on the left to see  disc covers, film clip comparisons, etc.  (Those who can't see my video clip, especially iOS users who can't see flash video, please go to Amazon's FULL site and look under my review for the comment section, where I posted an external link to the video.)<br /><br />Released in 1927, amid the golden age of the silent film era, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is a stylistic tour-de-force that has remained influential for the rest of the century, inspiring films from \\"Frankenstein\\" in 1931, \\"Bladerunner\\" in 1982, to \\"Dark City\\" in 1997. With its imaginative set design, elaborate photography, bold editing, and its then groundbreaking special effects, this German sci-fi silent classic exemplifies the highly inventive period of German Expressionism, which also include such film masterworks as \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligaru\\", \\"Nosferatu\\", \\"The Last Laugh\\", and Lang's \\"Die Nibelungen\\".<br /><br />In 2011, Kino released the 1984 \\"Giorgio Moroder\\" version of the classic on Blu-ray and DVD.  This version controversially contains a rock score accompaniment which, to many people, myself included, is quite inappropriate for the film.  Moroder, a record producer and an Oscar-winning songwriter (\\"Take My Breath Away\\", \\"Flashdance... What a Feeling\\"), deserves credit for restoring the previously butchered film to a presentable 82-minute version, but he added a few butcherings of his own.  Intertitles were replaced with subtitles.  Additional special effects were added.  And instead of a traditional score, Moroder naturally used what he knew best: a pop rock score with pop rhythm and beats that don't really mesh with the images.  His score is not just intrumental, but it comprises of fully-written songs sung by Pat Benatar, Freddie Mercury, and others, essentially turning the film into one big music video.  What Moroder didn't understand was that in a music video, the song is the centerpiece; but in a film, the IMAGE has to be the center.  A piece of film has its own rhythm and beats too.  Every cut, motion, close-up, etc, gives the image its rhythm, which Moroder has to understand is not always four-quarter time.  There are a few instrumental passages in the score, and they fare better and are less detrimental to the flow of the images.  But most of the score are songs.  The chapter listing shows the song titles and artists' names, but no subtitles are offered for the lyrics.  The quality of the songs vary, with Benatar's \\"Here's My Heart\\" seemingly the most effective, showing that Moroder at least paid attention to the movie's theme about the heart being the mediator in any struggle.  The picture quality is presentable, but Kino makes it clear on the back cover that this is an unrestored, straight transfer from an old print.  The Blu-ray does not look as good as other Blu-ray editions.  There are a fair amount of print damages and the picture looks a bit dark at times.  But the details of the high-def 1080p picture does come through, making this Blu-ray the best-looking edition of Moroder's Metropolis.  The score is offered in lossless DTS 5.1 on the Blu-ray (Dolby 5.1 on the DVD) and it sounds fine.  The Blu-ray also offers a lossless LPCM stereo track for those with legacy equipments.  Bonus features include a 17-minute documentary (in English with no subtitles) that providesa cursory coverage of the German silent film history, the history of \\"Metroplis\\", and Moroder's restoration.  Two trailers and 11 high-quality scans of publicity stills are also included.<br /><br />Currently, the \\"go-to\\" version of the Lang classic is the 2010 Kino Region-A Blu-ray edition and its corresponding Region-1 DVD edition.  They are titled \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" to avoid confusion with other editions.  They contain, to date, the most complete, two-and-a-half-hour cut of the film, combining the two-hour version from the monumental 2001 restoration effort by Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation (previously released as the 2003 Kino DVD), and about half-hour of footage discovered at Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2008 that had been unseen for decades. This previously lost footage has been edited back into the film to create this new \\"Complete Metropolis\\" edition. The added scenes are sprinkled all over the film, improving continuity, clarifying storytelling, and thus heightening the impact and yielding a result that is greater than the sum of its parts, as they finally restore Lang's full vision to its near complete form.<br /><br />The HD picture quality of the Blu-ray ranges from sparklingly clear in some footage, slightly softer in others (especially the special fx shots), to severely battered and damaged as in those newly-discovered shots.  All the \\"good-looking\\" footage came from the 2001 restoration.  With the upgrade to HD, the sharpness and the clarity over the DVD counterpart is readily apparent, and therefore this Blu-ray represents the best that the film has ever looked on home video.  Unfortunately, the half hour of new-found footage, originated from 16mm film, looks severely damaged and sometimes barely watchable, and it doesn't benefit much from the HD picture.  As the new footage is sprinkled all over the film, the picture quality oscillates between good and bad, normally an uncomfortable experience but a small price to pay for finally watching the most complete version yet of the classic.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc contains a lossless DTS 5.1 audio track of the original orchestral score by Gottfried Huppertz, performed by Berlin's Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra.  Many people would have preferred the newly-composed score by the Alloy Orchestra, who have actually toured North America with their excellent live accompaniment of the complete \\"Metropolis\\".  I contacted Alloy Orchestra and they said the German distributors would not allow Kino to use their score on the new edition.  Thus, Alloy Orchestra is selling their score on a CD disc, albeit in lossy MP3 format with only a 192 kbps bit rate.  Google \\"alloy metropolis order\\" to order it.<br /><br />The intertitles for the 2010 Kino edition, just like in the 2003 edition, are in English only.  Whenever there is on-screen German text, English subtitles are provided and not removable.<br /><br />If you are a purist who wants to see original German intertitles, the same thing German audiences saw back in 1927, you need to get the British Region-B \\"Masters of Cinema\\" Blu-ray or its corresponding Region-2 DVD edition by Eureka, titled \\"Metropolis\\".  They can be ordered at Amazon UK.  North American viewers would need a multi-region player to play Region-B or 2 discs, however.  The intertitles on these discs are in German only and supported by optional English subtitles.<br /><br />Supplements on Kino's 2010 edition do not contain any from the 2003 edition (so save that disc).  Instead, we have a pretty good 50-minute documentary titled \\"Voyage to Metropolis\\", shown in HD on the Blu-ray and narrated in German with optional English subtitles, about the dramatic history of \\"Metropolis\\" up to its re-discovery in Argentina.<br /><br />The TCM channel has also broadcast another excellent, 50-min documentary on the same subject titled \\"Metropolis Refound\\", but it is not available on any home video.<br /><br />The Eureka Region-B Blu-ray's HD picture qualityis virtually identical to the Kino Blu-ray edition.  Both editions have the same Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra score in lossless DTS.  Both have the \\"Voyage to Metropolis\\" documentary (shown in HD on Blu-ray).  The Eureka disc also contains an excellent full-length audio commentary by David Kalat and Jonathan Rosenbaum, while the Kino disc has a 9-minute interview with Paula Felix-Didier, curator of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires.  The Eureka disc also comes with a 56-page booklet of essays, interviews, and restoration notes.<br /><br />**BELOW IS MY REVIEW OF THE KINO 2003 DVD EDITION, originally posted Feb-24-2003**<br /><br />This Kino Region 1-only DVD offers an almost pristine-looking video transfer of the film. The untinted, black-and-white image is clean and sharp throughout, the result of a mostly manual frame-by-frame restoration started in 1998 by Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation. The included jacket essay gives a brief account of its efforts, as well as the work of other restorationists in the past, notably Munich Filmmuseum and film historian Enno Patalas. The DVD supplements also include an excellent mini-documentary that explains some of the technical details in the restoration.<br /><br />The film's running time on this DVD is 118 minutes (not 124 as printed on the case). It is shown at the speed of 24 frames per second, an unusual frame rate for a silent film. But according to F.W. Murnau Foundation, this was the projection speed used at the film's premiere in 1927. Some viewers may find the motion a bit too fast at times due to the high frame rate. But some believe this was director Fritz Lang's way to intensify some of the action. (For those who want to watch METROPOLIS at a slower speed, there is a PC DVD player called WinDVD 4.0, which lets you extend or shorten a DVD's running time without affecting the pitch of the audio.)<br /><br />This DVD only has English intertitles (supported by French and Spanish subtitles). The style, typeface, and the occasional animation in the intertitles were all re-created according to the original film. The original score by Gottfried Huppertz was also \\"adapted\\" from its 153-minute original length to the current, shorter length. This is the first time I have a chance to listen to Huppertz's elaborately orchestrated score, and it sounds terrific.<br /><br />This latest restoration, unfortunately, did not recover a lot of film footage that had been missing over the years. Major sequences that were lost, such as Maria's escape from Rotwang, are still lost. To make up for this, and to make the film's plot more coherent, new intertitles were inserted to summarize the story lines of the missing footage. These intertitles are frequently seen in this restored version, a constant reminder of the large amount (a quarter of the film) of lost footage.<br /><br />I did a brief side-by-side comparison between the Kino DVD and a few old video versions, and discovered the DVD actually has \\"alternate scenes\\" that were utilized for this restoration. In other words, Lang apparently shot some of the scenes *twice* (probably for domestic theaters and abroad), resulting in two versions of a scene looking slightly different. For instance, in the running competition early in the film, the winner wins by a bigger distance in all older video versions that I have seen than he does on the Kino DVD.<br /><br />The DVD's audio commentary by Enno Patalas is mild disappointment. As in the Kino DVD of THE BLUE ANGEL, the comments are too sparse and not too in-depth. And long stretches of silence are frequent. The commentary is largely analytical, and it points out some of the key themes and visual motifs of the film.<br /><br />The other DVD supplements include an involving 45-minute documentary that covers the making of the film, the German Expressionist period, the \\"unmaking\\" of METROPOLIS by censors and Hollywood, and a few interview segments of Lang. The still gallery contains about 90 production photos and design sketches, including about 27 photos taken from missing scenes.
B0000039QA|5.0|This album showcased the versatility of the late great BIG. It truly makes you wonder what the hip hop world would be like had we still been able to line up at stores for his next release. He set the tone for all albums with this one. Every artist to this day is still trying to duplicate this winning formula. BIG had asong on this album for each and every individual in the world. By far the best Hip Hop album I have ever expierienced.
B00005YXZH|4.0|FM radio is so full of boring, unimaginative fluff.  It's nice to know that a few artists are still interested in making good music, push the envelope, and are not willing to sell out to corporate thugs.  So goes the story of Wilco and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  If you haven't heard the story, Wilco was dumped by their label, Reprise, because their new album wasn't mainstream enough and didn't quite fit the band's marketed image as alternative-country popsters.  Wilco ended up distributing it through sister company, Nonesuch (both Reprise and Nonesuch are owned by AOL-Time Warner).  <br />I'm glad they didn't give in to marketing &quot;experts&quot; at Reprise because the end product, YHF, is by far their best work to-date.  Wilco fits in the artist mold of Radiohead or Beck, who also try to change their musical styles frequently and avoid repeating past successes.  While it may not be the best way to find your market niche, which is what I think concerned Reprise execs, it is a good way to challenge yourself and music listeners.  YHF tries to break barriers by combining different musical genres.  They put a little of the unfamiliar with the familiar.  At times you swear you're listening to the Beatles with Clapton grinding away on guitar and on other tracks you are mellowing out in outer space with Radiohead or Bjork.  I'm a big fan of taking risks and I guess that's what intrigues me about this album.<br />It's a shame Grammy didn't nod Wilco's way on this venture.  In my opinion, the quality of musical production on this cd outweighs many of the big winners and/or nominees.  No offense to the Boss, but if his album hadn't been about post 9/11 America, there is no way his album would have been such a heavy nominee.  Bands like Wilco deserve attention they don't get, and they certainly deserve a fair listen from any true music fan.
0060977493|2.0|I laboured with this book, I really did, which explains my poor rating and why Roy's first novel found itself parked on my coffee table for most of its tenuous existence with me.  I am certain a great story exists within the pages given the recognition Roy has received, but after each chapter I kept asking myself: &quot;Please Roy, just where are you going with this plot?&quot;.  This verdict may be unfair and it is a shame because there's some great, imaginative writing here - wonderful visualizations and anecdotes.  Unfortunatly, I just kept counting the pages until I was finished.
B000002VCU|5.0|A great album, though the occasional disco influence catches a bit, and distracts one very briefly a couple of times.  Is this a concept album about gambling?  Hmm...  Think &quot;metaphor&quot; and look at the album cover.  One of my all-time favorites.
B0000024UF|5.0|Cohen followed up his debut album with another masterpiece, this collection of magnificent songs of solitude, despair and resignation. Besides The Partisan, a song about the French resistance with its beautiful French verses and female vocals, all compositions are by Cohen. The most popular number here is Bird On A Wire that has been covered by artists as diverse as Johnny Cash, Joe Cocker, Judy Collins, Rita Coolidge, Tim Hardin, The Neville Brothers and Jennifer Warnes. For some reason, the opening lines of Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes makes me think of Frodo's journey to Mordor (in Lord Of The Rings): \\"A bunch of lonesome and very quarrelsome heroes/Were smoking out upon the open road.\\" Other highlights include The Story Of Isaac and The Old Revolution, in both of which Cohen's characteristic Biblical imagery surfaces, and the somber Lady Midnight with its many levels of meaning. Seems So Long Ago is a wistful confessional dirge whilst You Know Who I Am is a delicate love poem with esoteric undertones:\\"I am the one who loves changing from nothing to one\\". The mood lightens up on the closing track Tonight Will Be Fine with its catchy melody, driving rhythm and erotic lyric to end the album on a more optimistic note, although even here the sadness is just a sigh away. Cohen's sublime music has a transcendent, spiritual quality. These haunting songs \\"from a room\\" have lost none of their poetic impact after 3 decades; their grace, elegance and beauty shine on.
0812548094|5.0|I was not sure I would enjoy this novel, but after reading the first couple pages I was hooked.I never put it down, Terry Goodkind has one of the best creative minds. He knows how to grab hold of your mind and keep it there with these novels.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Just like XXX would be James Bond for the MTV drones, The Fast & The Furious is Days of Thunder minus the NASCAR label for the MTV drones.  A forgettable plot, sloppy editing, ethnic stereotypes, and characters you just can't care for are abound here (just about all of which director Rob Cohen would bring to XXX), and the sappy, cheesey dialogue won't bowl you over either unless you listen to Ja Rule or Linkin Park music and wear Fubu clothing.  Vin Diesel, who has actually put on half decent performances in Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room, and Pitch Black, is just here to brood around and show his muscles, nothing more.  Any talent that any of the actors have is beyond wasted, and in the end The Fast & The Furious is stupid and almost unwatchable (and I thought Gone in 60 Seconds was bad...).  All in all, those with a functioning brain should check out good films like Minority Report, Blood Work, Reservoir Dogs, Frailty, or The Royal Tenenbaums if they actually want to watch something worthwhile; just skip this.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Vocal: Typical MK voice hasn't changed, maybe even improved with age.<BR>Lyrics: Brilliantly crafted to tell the colorful stories which abound on this CD. One of MK's best if not the best at meaningful story description without the slightest hint of being trite or forced.<BR>Songwriting: quite basic folk-based songs but with the familiar twists and style MK brings to the table. The writing is solid and the melodies easily digestable. Even some traditional piano-bar sounding tracks.<BR>Instrumentation: simple but stylish, acoustic guitar, bass, some drum tracks, some minimalist electric lead guitar<BR>Production/Recording: Top shelf. Rich sounding with huge dynamic range. Outstanding clarity and presence. The mix allows listener to clearly hear every instrument with detail. Doesn't get any better.<BR>Comments: Overall a must for MK fans, and for absolutely anyone that enjoys folk music. This CD is both intelligent and relaxing. When you combine that with superb songwriting and sound quality you've got a great music investment.
0316666343|3.0|I enjoyed reading the first half of this book. The second half becomes (as my friend called it) &quot;a barrage of emotional woo-woo&quot;.<br />Since I'm not crazy about it, I wouldn't recommend buying it. Instead I'd say to check it out from your local library since the odds are slim that you'd read it more than once.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I haven't been as disappointed with a film people have raved about since THE DOOM GENERATION. THE DOOM GENERATION was a piece of junk from beginning to end, while DONNIE DARKO does have some witty dialogue and some great acting. But overall it just did not remotely live up to the raves. A lot of the movie is terribly contrived. If you raved about this film and haven't seen THE DOOM GENERATION, you probably should. That's an inverted recommendation, I know.
B00000K19E|5.0|This film is so full of symbolism, it can be interpreted in many different ways. If you don't find any meaning at all in this film it says more about you as a person than it does about Keanu's bad acting. The only places this film falls short is in its attempt at pleasing action film junkies.<BR>It is an action film, not an idiot flick.
0312305060|5.0|I will try not to sound prejudiced. Michael Cunningham wrote a novel which seems as if forged by a woman's mind. Reading the emotional heartache and struggle, one would think a woman wrote this book. But Michael Cunningham is superb, psychological, profound. He definately knows Virgina Woolf, who had a life full of emotional crisis, who gave the literary world stream-of-conscious novels and beautiful writing. Virginia Woolf's verbage was always striking. In \\"The Hours\\" ( the title suggests the theme- the hours of our lives must be taken seriously, enjoyed, to really LIVE THEM), Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep in the movie) is a strong, independent 50 plus woman who is married to an author dying of AIDS who also happens to have some mental disorders. She is preparing to throw a party for his honor. At the same time, we look back at 1950's suburbia where a pregnant Laura Brown and her son prepare a cake for her husban'ds  birthday. Virginia Woolf, in the English countryside, is brainstorming to write her short story, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".<br />For those who have read Virginia Woolf and in particular, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" the series of events that occur in \\"The Hours\\" should strike a familiar bell. Mrs. Dalloway reappears in the lives of Laura Brown, specifically, but one can make the argument that Clarissa Vaugn is also Mrs. Dalloway's reincarnation. The tragic parts express human suffering, particularily the sadness of loss, the poignancy of living with a terminal illness, the fleeting sense of living. The lives of the characters are complex, vivid and remarkably true to life. Cunningham will be a noteworthy writer on my list. Some of the things are very dark, but poignant. The contemplation of death and life, transience, loss and the madness and despair at human nature is best expressed with Virginia Woolf's eccentric, melancholic persona. Two suicides in the book. Virginia Woolf said it best, \\"To look life in the face- to love it. And then to put it away.\\"
B00005YW4H|3.0|A multi-platinum seller on Blue Note? Huh? Norah Jones has become a true phenomenon.  The young jazz-pop singer has topped the charts and swept the Grammies, maybe next she will attain peace on Earth.  What does this mean to me?<br />Well, I am stuck in the middle on this new artist.  On one hand, I pull for anyone today who does not seem to be the product of some assembly line of over-singing, attitude-in your face singers that stink up the charts. I admire artists who don't come accross as a marketing scheme. On the other hand this seems a tad slight to be a mega-selling classic.  There are some good songs here and nothing really sticks out as being bad or truely uninspired, but I found myself wandering while listening.  There is nothing as eccentric or passionate as artists like Billie Holliday or Nina Simone, whom Jones has been compared to.<br />Anyways, I do see alot of promise here.  If she does not succumb to releasing COME AWAY WITH ME parts I through V and pushes herself artiscally, she could become a true force.  She obviously has eclectic tastes, a seductive voice and seems tastefull on the piano.  She doesn't have to go into free jazz, but a few curveballs and dynamics in her arrangements would do wonders.
B0000524CY|5.0|This is the best film ever produced.  Ellen Burstyn was robbed by the Academy for her role.

B00005JLSC|2.0|\\"Chicago\\" tries oh-so-hard to be energetic but comes off flat as a pancake.  I think the main problem is the music: too repetitive, too harsh, too tuneless, and too much of it.  And the casting-largely against type-just can't overcome the lack of energy in the music, choreography, and script.  Richard Gere deserves credit for taking on a musical role: his acting is superb and gives it everything he's got.  Unfortunately his singing is rather weak, which undermines the powerful arrogance he's trying to convey.  Renee Zellweger performs brilliantly, but she's just not edgy enough for her impossibly sinister role.  On the other hand, Catherine Zeta-Jones is perfect as a malevolent murderess: she looks it, acts it, and sings it.  Queen Latifah's character confused the heck out of me: one minute she's gentle as a lamb, the next minute she's the warden from hell.  John C. Reilly, one of the most versatile actors around, does a predictably fantastic job as Zellweger's witless, gullible husband.  Overall, this simply does not live up to its hype.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I have listened to this cd a millon times since I bought it.  The music is great.  She is the best artist out there if you ask me.  I have been a die hard fan of hers since the first time I saw her on tv.  This cd is another reason why I love her so much.  fist of all,  most of the songs have a good beat.  I cant say that for all...  I love boys the most out of all the songs and second I love lonley.  Those songs are the best.  Bambastic love and cinderella are okey.  Nothing wild about them.  What it's like to be me is a great song that represents how she has grown over the past years.  One of my favorete songs on the cd is one I cant tell you about because I hade it flown in from Japan so not all the songs are the same, but I have all the ones on the american version.  I would recomend this cd to anyone pireod.
0066214122|5.0|In the beginning, our narrator, Jack Forman, ominously reveals that \\"Things never turn out the way you think they will\\". Jack is a Bay Area high tech manager who has recently been fired, for exposing corruption in his company. His wife is in charge of a team that has been developing a kind of nano-spy plane.  These nano-planes are intended to be a swarm of micro-robots that can fly to remote places and, acting in concert, send back a visual image.  The team is using a piece of software that Jack wrote to control the swarms of nanoparticles, and hence when they get out of control he is called into the Nevada desert to try to help reign them in.  As the battle rages, the nano-swarm begins to demonstrate what is referred to \\"emergent behavior\\", ie their tactics evolve.  <br />As the plot twists & turns, I found myself drawn in and glued to this book.  While it may not be fine literature, it is a tremendously enjoyable read.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|I thought Rajaz was the best Camel album in years, but when I played \\"A Nod & A Wink\\", I changed my mind. This album is INCREDIBLE! DO NOT MISS IT! The album is a beautiful, stirring tribute to the late, great Peter Bardens. You'll find lots of flutes, as well as slicing, thick Moog sounds reminiscent of Camel's classic albums. Guy LeBlanc is the best Camel keyboardist since Kit Watkins. The shimmering keyboard trills in \\"A Boy's Life\\" remind one of Bardens' in the middle section of \\"Echoes\\" from \\"Breathless.\\" Elements of  \\"I Can See Your House from Here\\", \\"Nude\\" (especially \\"Docks\\"), \\"Moonmadness\\" and \\"Rain Dances\\" can be heard, as well. My favorite track is \\"Squigely Fair.\\" It has all the best Camel elements: soaring Moog synths, flutes, the guitar virtuosity and sensitivity of Andy Latimer, and a new, enchanting melody with every changing passage. \\"For Today\\" is marvelous, as well. Susan Hoover's lyrics are deeply moving. \\"Fox Hill\\" is a lot of fun, while still being a very complex but melodic musical composition. Colin Bass' moaning, mournful fretless bass can be heard on a number of tracks - his playing is very artistic and emotional. Denis Clement is the best Camel drummer since Andy Ward. Need I say more? If this album is missing from your Camel collection, BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM AT NEARFEST 2003!!
B000002HAF|5.0|The pixies saved me from the torments of social isolation. <br />The pixies are so awesome they make me want to eat people.
0449002128|1.0|I enjoyed \\"The Marching Season\\" and \\"The Mark of the Assassin.\\" I read the unique and brilliant thriller \\"The Unlikely Spy.\\" With that much going for him, I was really looking forward to a crackling spy thriller in \\"The Kill Artist.\\"<br />Unfortunately, I was bitterly disappointed. I still love Silva's writing style, and I'll say that up front. His prose is easy to read; you'll consume large chunks of text in one sitting. <br />However, his plotting in this novel is amateurish at best. A painter-master spy (Gabriel Allon) is a cool concept for a protagonist, but then you put him on a surveillance mission? The most exciting thing he does is reprogram an alarm clock! You think I'm kidding, but I guarantee it!<br />So most of the action revolves around Jacqueline Delacroix, who is a supermodel on par with Cindy Crawford or Christy Turlington. And lucky for Jacqueline and Gabriel, the Palestinians never think to look on the cover of any magazine when they're trying to figure out who she is! No, but they happen to notice she's the same chick from some grainy photo of an operation that took place twelve years before! Crickey!<br />One other thing I found annoying about this book is that the first three chapters do not use names for the main characters. Unfortunately, Silva thought it would be cool if he didn't give any of the characters names until later. He thinks it builds suspense, but to the reader it is aggravating reading about \\"the stranger\\" who paints, or \\"the man\\" who is trying to assassinate a Israeli foreign minister.<br />The underlying moral value in the book is that people have many faces, both private and public. Nobody really knows someone else's identity. In the first chapters of the book, he tries to slam this home so that you feel like you know no one in the book. Things clear up later, but you have to be patient.<br />Unfortunately, patience never pays off for the plot. The action is few and far between. When the climax comes, the result defies logic.The impact on the protagonist is vague. I don't want to spoil it for you, so I'll leave it at that.<br />An untapped resource in this book is the Israeli Intelligence Chief Ari Shamron. He is the most intriguing figure as a gruff and calloused spymaster using agents as pawns, but he was under-utilized.<br />I just can't put a positive spin on this book besides this: Silva has so much potential that I hope his next works harness the imagination we saw in \\"The Unlikely Spy.\\"

B00005JKCH|4.0|Spiderman is a great movie, though the first time I saw it, I had to laugh at some of the effects and acting.  But it's still entertainment.  Many people disparaged the movie because they didn't like the villain.  I thought his argument with himself was one of the best parts of the movie, a scene used later in the year by Gollum in Two Towers, again one of the best scenes in that film.  The worst part of Spiderman was that last monologue given by Kirsten Dunst.  Didn't look real.  Looked like acting.  Real people don't spend five minutes reciting lines about how they love someone without interaction from the other party.
0805062971|4.0|While not the best book of all time, definetely worth a purchase.  The book is filled with great one liners, and an involving story line.  If you haven't yet seen the movie or read the book, I suggest reading the book first... I think the shock is better that way, but even if you have seen the movie, pick this up.  It's far better, with a better ending, and the jokes are more developed.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Launched to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the Japanese bombing of the American Navy, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; tries to capitalize on American sentiment by releasing a movie that has more to do with a typical Hollywood love story than a historical film.  The visual effects and the recreation of December 7th save this movie from what is otherwise a long drawn out and highly cliched love story (did I mention improbable? -although I'm sure at some point during the war it happened...)  Overall, I can't help but feel that Hollywood lunged to capitalize on an American tragedy by commercializing the deaths of Americans (the DVD was released on December 7, 2001) ...enough said.
B000088E6D|4.0|This guy is one impressive singer.  He's one of the more smooth swinging singers with a voice that easily channels the great Chet Baker.  It's a great CD as well.  If I have one complaint, it's that there are no dynamics in the song selections.  All cuts are slow to mid-tempo.  Where's the smokin', in-your-face, swing-out tunes?  However, there are a few stand out cuts.  I love these versions of &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Summer Wind.&quot;  But it's covers of Morrison's &quot;Moondance&quot; and especially George Michael's &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot; that are tops.  I can't wait to see how Buble's career evolves.
B000002WU9|5.0|Raekwon the Chef, of Staten Island's Wu Tang Clan, has made what may very well be one of the greatest quasi-solo hip hop records of all time with his banger, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. The 18 cuts are studded with all-star production from the group's leader, RZA (Robert Diggs), and his counter part, Ghostface Killah, who delivers equally praisable lyrical flow. The plethora of neck - snapping beats mixed with Raekwon's narrative rhymes and Ghostface's staccato nonsense emerges into a hip hop masterpiece for the ages.<BR> As opposed to the group's other solo releases, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, offers consistent greatness and a rugged beauty. In the scheme of hip hop as a genre, Raekwon's album is what should be considered the Wu-Tang Clan's finest work to date and would therefore put the album itself on the top 10 scale of greatest hip hop records of all time.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Let's get this straight. I was of the mindset that nobody could EVER replace Steve Perry, frontman for one of the greatest rock bands of all time. In fact, even though I thought &quot;Arrival&quot; was a very solid album, it was this mindset that kept me from buying the Journey 2001 DVD. I mean who would want to watch somebody else sing &quot;Perry's&quot; songs?! Sacrilege!<br />Man was I WRONG. As this concert proves, these weren't Perry's songs, they were Journey's songs, and from start to finish, this is one of the most enjoyable concert DVD's I've watched to date. Terrific musicianship, terrific sound and visuals, thoroughly enjoyable.<br />Steve Augeri is flat-out fantastic vocally. You are really doing yourself a disservice by getting hung up on how much you think he does or does not sound like Steve Perry. The guy pulls off every song brilliantly and he cohesively blends in with the band, not as a frontman but as an equal. This DVD is all about the music, and let me tell you, the MUSIC IS GREAT.
0385720920|5.0|This is my second favorite book of Chuck Palahniuk, (behind Lullaby) the stories great, the characters are all well developed, and of course, the twists are there and well done.  Definitely a book I would recommend without reservations.
0451169514|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read. it is a little slow but always pretty scary, the characters are very likable and believable. the movie was fair, it left out a lot of the book. A great book to anyone who likes a good horror story.
0790729628|5.0|I first saw this film on video in the mid '80s, a few years after the theatrical release and was immediately a fan.  Then in the early '90s, the Director's Cut was released.  Here is where my opinion differs with the other reviews so far.  The voice-over is a distraction and completely unnecessary.  With the voice-over this film was reduced to a Dick Tracy detective story with a very Hollywood ending.  The directors cut has a darker less certain ending with suggestions that Decker is a replicant.<br />If the SciFi genre can be defined in a single statement, I think it would be \\"an exploration of possibilities\\".  Many of the SF movies put out by Hollywood are just the same old stories in an unusual setting.  Blade Runner is a dark story where much is conveyed though the setting and visual elements.  Notice that the only place that the sun shines is when Decker goes to the world of the replicants.  The Replicant world is more \\"human\\" than earth.  This switch in context is a common aspect many SF stories and makes you question your own frame of reference.  These elements come through much better without the voice-over because the voice-over attempts to force the viewer to associate with the human aspect of Decker.  In the original theatrical version, all hints of the possibility of Decker being a replicant is removed.  To me, this negates the core meaning of the film.<br />The original theatrical version is a good Hollywood movie with a sugar coated ending.  The director's cut is a deeply complex film with film-nior elements.  The ending of the director's cut alone raises questions of existence and reality that the theatrical version does not.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Once upon a time, Paddy Chavesky wrote a movie screenplay. In it, he envisioned a television network which, in search of higher ratings, puts on shows about Marxist revolutionaries, psychic soothsayers, and, to hold it all together, a certifiably insane man who threatened to blow his brains out on the air. He intended the film to be a scathing satire on the world of television and how it would do anything for a 30 share.<br />Now, a quarter-century later, \\"Network\\" seems much more than just a satire; it has become prophecy. The most popular programs on TV are so-called \\"reality shows,\\" featuring people who are willing to eat bugs, relinquish every shred of privacy (and dignity) and expose their most personal dreams -- all for the chance of getting on that magic box. <br />Shows like \\"RealTV\\" and \\"Cops,\\" while perhaps not quite up to the movie's fictional \\"Mao Tse Tung Hour,\\" are not far behind as they revel in mayhem and chaos. The psychic beyond-the-grave \\"Crossing Over with John Edward\\" echoes the movie's \\"Sybil the Soothsayer.\\" And any of the ranting, bullying pundits who infest the airwaves can sound an awful lot like Howard Beale himself.<br />When it was first released back in 1976, moviegoers took comfort in the fact that the wild excesses of \\"Network,\\" while fantastically exaggerated, could never really happen. Today, with \\"Joe Millionaire\\" and \\"The Bachelorette\\" firmly lodged at the top of the ratings, one has to wonder whether Chayevsky was on to something. He just had to let the world catch up.
B000066NW0|4.0|(...)this is an awesome CD if you love variety. Again, she has her own unique style. Avril has a great attitude about life and she expresses it great within her lyrics. So I'll give you my opinion on some songs: <BR>Losing Grip and Unwanted-great attitude within these songs! Turn them up full blast to experience them fully. <BR>Compicated-Well I don't know anyone who has not heard this song so this one is self explanitory.<BR>Sk8ter Boi-Very Cute story if you read the lyrics.<BR>I'm With You and Tomorrow-Two very pretty and slow songs. (a big contrast with Losing Grip) <BR>Nobody's Fool-great song, very true, with a bunch of attitude<BR>Too much to ask-Another slow song, I think it is a very sad and emotional song. It's about loosing someone who chose drugs over you. Just read the lyrics to really feel this song.<BR> <BR>Try this CD and see for yourself. There is another side to Avril than just Complicated. but two to three years down the road we aren't going to want to hear it again.  Here's hoping for some much needed maturity into a promising star. whats possible from Avril in the future.t be hitting the skip track that often
B00005JKES|5.0|What happened to you guys out there in the DVD world. Did you forget that there are still more episodes to release? What good is the first session with out the rest of the sessions? Think about it - if there a x ammount of people who bought the first session - then there is x amount of people who want the rest. Get it together folks - start working and do something right for once.
B00006AW2P|5.0|I'm usually pretty skeptical about these higher priced \\"remastered\\" versions of the albums that were the soundtrack of my youth. But this ABKCO series is the best thing they've ever done. On first listening I thought--\\"Wow, they really did Charlie justice!!!\\" Then I realized that everyone sounds better than ever. There are nuances in Jagger's vox that aren't apparent on the original vinyl or the pretty horrible original ABKCO CD releases from the '80s. By all means, go for these if you've got the scratch.
B00005YW4H|4.0|These days we are often bombarded with a slew of female singers touted as being the next this or that.  99 % of them fall short, being nothing more than the products of good marketing, supported by a team of make-up artists, dressers, slick Vanity Fairesque photographers and other image-makers.  Listening to the radio is not as much fun as it used to be.  Those of us who grew up with older parents and listened to the true greats of jazz, or appreciate the musicianship of some singers and groups of the 70's and 80's know what is good and what is not.  Still, good music does not have to scream or resort to slick videos to be effective nor does it have to go at the speed of sound.  It can be quiet and soothing and still make a point.  It is in this sense, Norah Jones delivers.  She is very talented, and does take the craft of music seriously.  She understands that gimmicks do not work.  She simply sits at the piano and sings and presents her musical thoughts in a  quiet, direct way.  I would not call her a jazz singer, or even dare to compare her to the greats of jazz because that is going a bit too far.  In fact, she is an interesting m&eacute;lange of musical influences and styles.  In some ways, she reminds me of Julia Fordham with a tinge of Rickie Lee Jones.  She is very good, but is still very young and has a way to go yet in her development, but the possibilities are endless and her future bright.  The very first time I heard her on lite FM here in N.Y.C., I stopped what I was doing to listen because the lyrics and music were good.  Her music is soothing, relaxing and she seems to be inviting you out for a lazy Saturday in the park with a picnic lunch and a good bottle of wine.  I am looking forward to her next cd and to seeing her develop as an artist.
B000002H97|5.0|This CD Is Great one of the best pieces of recording work in the metal genre ever however i do not reccomend this CD to any pop music fans because this cd is full of nothing but pure metal.<BR>The stand out track from this album is definitely ENTER SANDMAN<BR>followed by the equally impressive SAD BUT TRUE and then followed by the musically unique HOLIER THAN THOU whitch is truely one of the best metal songs ever written.Some other fine examples of great music include the adventurous WHEREVER I MAY ROAM and the influencing THE UNFORGIVEN and the softer more light hearted NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.See Below for a step by step review of all the songs<br />ENTER SANDMAN- 8/10<BR>SAD BUT TRUE-  7/10<BR>HOLIER THAN THOU- 10/10<BR>THE UNFORGIVEN-  6/10<BR>WHEREVER I MAY ROAM-6/10<BR>DONT TREAD ON ME-6/10<BR>THROUGH THE NEVER- 5/10<BR>NOTHING ELSE MATTERS- 9/10<BR>OF WOLF AND MAN- 9/10<BR>THE GOD THAT FAILED- 5/10<BR>MY FREIND OF MISSERY- 6/10<BR>THE STRUGGLE WITHIN -9/10
B000068MKZ|5.0|This album is one of the best to come out of France in the past few months.  It is classical french:  a bit folky and surprisingly tender.  It is one that you can listen to over and over and never get sick of.  Surprising from an Italian ex-supermodel
B000000WJZ|5.0|Possibly the greatest album of the 1990's. Remains fresh to this date, and every song is solid. The previous review is an irrelevant Billy Corgan hating post.
B000075BFK|4.0|2Pac is a rare phenomenon in music.  Being shot down in 1996, he has released more albums dead than alive.  He has an amazingly loyal fanbase who stick by him;  almost to cult like behavior.  Such an amazing and controversial character, his lyrics make you care; his music is undeniable and his charm and personality is likable.  A troubled man people struggled to understand; sometimes very angry and at other times sincere, busting nines and riding on enemies while paying respects to his moms and educating the youth.  This guy was real.  Just like any person , he contradicts himself...changes moods and feelings on certain subjects.  Able to speak through his lyrics and touch every single fan without changing his style.<BR>This 2Pac recording is, on a whole, better than Until The End Of Time; even though all off the songs aren't unreleased.  For example, \\"Late Night\\" and WHo Do YOu Believe In come straight off the Chronic 2000 album.  \\"My Block\\" was featured on the The Show Soundtrack, and \\"Thugz Mansion\\" and Fair Xchange appear twice on the album.  So Out of 26 tracks, 23 are new and two of those are remixes.  Leaving 21 for the listener to digest.  BUT if you know the underground, you have undoubtedly already heard When We Ride On Our Enemie and Life I Lead.  NOt to mention 'Military Minds\\" appeared on the ONe Nation album.  So that actually leaves 18 new tracks, minus the intro, which would make it 17 tracks.  This tells me that the well is running low.  This also tells me it should be the last 2Pac album.<br />I won't go through each song because 2Pac is/was a visionary and I could spend forever talking about the songs.  There's a couple things you should know.  The beats are good beats but some of them don't particularly compliment 2Pac's style, particularly the Jazze Pha beats;  his beats are too smooth for Pac, he needs rugged street beats.  Second, obviously, the material is dated which may be a turnoff for some.  Third there are many guest appearances whetherit's the Outlawz or Ronald Isley.  MOre modern names make it to the album such as T.I., Trick Daddy, Mya, and Tyrese, and some may question if he would have worked with these artists.  Most of the songs are remixes, and the loyal fans may be angered that the originals were altered.  If you can get past these minor 'problems', the album is riding.  I'm feeling it.  If you like Pac you will like the album...it's more of that Pac style...great lyrics, tight beats, and incredible choruses.<br />I would definitely recommend this cd, despite its flaws.  Every rapper in the game respects Pac and his music and it seems as if every major rapper out today has been influenced (Eminem, Nas, 50, Jay-Z, Ja Rule, DMX, Freeway, etc etc.).  Tupac is a legend and this is just a piece of his legacy.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I might not have quite the same emotions about this as the folks at the Mernau Institute when they first realized that the Argentines had indeed come up with a genuinely complete version of this masterwork, but tonight I remain quite moved by both the grace of the complete film and the satisfaction of finally witnessing the culmination of an exhaustive decades long search.<br /><br />The version that Kino distributed a few years ago did a great job suggesting the added complexity of the original work, and there are no \\"new\\" scenes presented that greatly change the thrust of the story.  But the power of the story, and the sophisticated interplay of all the characters as originally conceived is quite stunning.  Some of the new shots reinforce those we are familiar with.  Others give us hypnotizing glimpses into the darker aspects that the original american cut sought to negate.<br /><br />I might caution that the first newly discovered footage doesn't start appearing until nearly a half hour into it, but from the point where the monument to a woman who was wife, mother, and assumedly lover, of the three male leads is revealed, the story surely inherits a primal underpinning that I never experienced in any prior viewing.  The new footage then continues to reveal and refine the intricacies that nudge this from broad parable to a more intimate connection with the viewer.<br /><br />To those who have longed to experience the complete Metropolis, your time has come.
B0000033P0|5.0|This is the very best album ELP ever recorded, no doubt about it.  If you do not like this album, you have a head like a coconut, go listen to some Janet Jackson tough guy.
B00007JVBI|4.0|When I first heard You Are Free, I was running a 102-degree temperature and, in the ripe self-absorption of a good flu, didn't think myself long for this world. A perfect time, then, to sit a spell with Chan Marshall and her first album of new material since 1998's classic Moon Pix. <br />Like they say, things have changed, but you're still the same. Ms. Marshall's assertion two years ago that Free was going to be lighthearted and &quot;happy&quot; was a remarkable proposition, yet proves predictably false from the first note. Songwriting remains a cathartic, cleansing experience for Marshall, and potent enough that many are confused that the manifestly dark songwriter remains a breezy interview. <br />Still, Ms. Marshall seems to have a brighter disposition on Free than ever before, while the focus and force of her angst has eased moderately from the unbelievably dire straits facing her earlier records. As a famously shy and reticent performer, it follows that the first two songs on Free revolve around simple riffs on fan expectation and idolatry (&quot;Don't be in love with the autograph / Just be in love when you sing that song all night long&quot;). On later tracks, Marshall considers unhappy children and half-dead lives, but without the serrated edge of her earlier work. <br />Free finally finds Marshall comfortable in the recording studio. The album is full of quirky, subtle colorings via David Campbell's strings, Dave Grohl's remarkably practical drumming, and Marshall's own guitar overdubs. &quot;Good Woman&quot; works a familiarly &quot;Cat Power&quot; chord progression to haunting effect, as the surreal combination of children's harmonies, Eddie Vedder's mumbling, Dirty 3's Warren Ellis' violin and the string arrangement of Mr. Campbell (who sired one Beck Hansen) poke their heads around Marshall's overdriven guitar figure and resolute vocal. <br /> The album's last third slows to the glacial pace of 2001's Covers Record with underdeveloped song fragmentsrendered in a numbing, spare style. But the album's first half more than makes up for it with Marshall's inimitably concise songwriting painting roses on demons and frowning children alike. Ms. Marshall is a superbly gifted storyteller whose soft, forgiving moan rolls as clear and sweet as warm honey, and her songs elucidate the beauty and inevitability of human suffering in a way few others can. Let's just hope it doesn't take five years for the next one. <br />Ben Sterling<BR>Junkmedia Review
B000007T1M|1.0|This release has to be the single worst album in the history of music by the single worst band. No band has ever come even close this kind of atrocity.<BR>Not a single band member is at all talented at his respective instrument, and the songwriting is even more pathetic. They toggle between a few simple power chords at all times and the vocalist, who sounds reminiscent of a goat with laryngitis, shouts out-of-key rants in a horribly simplistic rythem. As for the lyrics, they certainly are nothing to rave about. You can get the jist of the intent, but the delivery falls short of what would be expected from a remedial-level high-shool teacher. If you want senseless teen angst, then by all means buy this garbage, but if you want quality music, look elsewhere.
B000002MTU|5.0|Eric Clapton returns to his roots on this album, dropping the seven-minute solos for a more traditional blues standards. Instead, he covers sixteen great blues tunes from the likes of Willie Dixon, Elmore James, Eddie Boyd, Sonny Thompson, and Freddy King. Clapton's voice is ragged and bluesy, something he could not have done early in his career. His guitar playing in dripping with stereotypical blues phrasing and turnarounds. There's nothing but the blues here. <br />Every song on this album is a great song, and each has appeared on many different albums throughout the years. These are classic blues tunes that should be in any guitar blues enthusiast's collection. Clapton starts the album off with the great Leroy Carr's \\"Blues Before Sunrise\\". Slide guitar blues ensue, and Clapton's newly discovered gravely voice is fitting. \\"Third Degree\\" is beautifully done slow blues full of pain, and one of the best songs of the album. Other greats are \\"Reconsider Baby\\", \\"Five Long Years\\", and \\"It Hurts Me Too\\". <br />This is like the greatest hits of blues as performed by Clapton. He shows class and respect by playing these tunes the way they were written. There are no extended solos here, or a studio quality sounds. These songs were recorded live with a full blues feeling of the musicians. It's different from what mainstream Clapton fans might expect, but for those that are fans of the blues, this is a stellar hit.
6304025831|3.0|Although I never saw the 1990 blockbuster 'Goodfellas'; and am not a huge mob movie fan, I do have to say that I enjoyed Martin Scorsese's 'Casino'.  And the cast here also contains some of the main components of 'Goodfellas', including Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent.  And the stand-out performance goes to De Niro, who plays the role of Sam Rothstein; or as he's known by many: Ace.  This movie may be very long (somewhere around three hours running time), but the length is what adds to the greatness of the film.  It's not too long and it's definitely not boring.  Getting back to De Niro's main character, you soon see the life of Sam.  It's a life that has as many ups and downs as that of a roller coaster.  One of those downs, as you begin to see partway into the film, is Joe Pesci's character.  Pesci, who took home an Oscar for his supporting role in 'Goodfellas', assumes the role of Nicky Santoro.  Nicky's a bad guy.  It's as simple as that.  But nevertheless, Sam and Nicky are good friends.<br />The story basically tells us how the mob attempts to take over the gambling scene, which in the movie is controlled by Robert De Niro (who owns a casino).  And being a three hour film, you get a good look at how this alleged capture is done.  Often times such a long movie bores people and slows the story too much, but not here.  Scorsese's direction and De Niro's acting will not even begin to bore you.  In fact, the first tape seems to end rather quickly.<br />And besides the acting of De Niro and Pesci, actress Sharon Stone gives a brilliant performance that earned her an Oscar nomination.  She plays a dazzling young Ginger who catches the eye of De Niro; and Pesci for that matter.  By the by her role is so different from the rest that you can't help but appreciate her acting.  The only reason that I gave 'Casino' 3 stars (it's really about 3.5 or so), and not more, is because I was a little disappointed with the turnout of Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein's character.  But the movie's acting and directing is certainly worth your time.  If you like mob movies, or even if you don't, then see this movie.  It's very well done.character.

B000003TAW|5.0|If I used one word to describe this cd it'd be classic.  This cd is so amazing every single song is good and a handful of them are immortal.  I will never get tired of listening to this cd.  And if I had to listen to one cd for the rest of my life this would be it, and i dont think that id get tired of it either!!!!!<BR>This is a must have cd for anyone that ever listens to music.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|This DVD restored version is the best version of this classic movie that this reviewer has seen.  It does has its good and not so good points, but what doesn't?<br />Firstly the picture transfer and restoration can be considered a success.  I compared this version to the Laserdisc Moroder(spelling?) version.  My conclusions are that the reduction in the frame rate speed and the inclusion of additional footage make this DVD preferrable.  Whether or not the film was shown with color tints,  I definitely think that this film works better with the tinting, which adds to the the effect of having two separate worlds - that of the workers and that of the elite who inhabit the surface.<br />The frame speed as played back here has been controversal.  I tried several experiments using the variable playback speed.  At 20 frames per second the action is still not true to life.  One has to get to .65X to make it so.  This speed would be the most preferrable.  The audio, however, does suffer at these reduced speeds.<br />The audio is  a disappointment.  The score adds little value to this film.  I felt myself not being drawn in emotionally as much as with the Moroder version.  In this case - and I may be in the minority here - I think that a modern (read pop or rock)score, in particular the Moroder score works much better than the classical score, after all it is a futuristic vision we are being shown.  Also, Moroder's use of silence and sound effects are much more effective and at times stunning.<br />The most useless part of this new release is the commentary.  Granted I did not hear it all but what I heard was someone describing what they thought the religious symbolism was during a  scene.  This was, in my opinion, not appropriate.  This is only someone's impression or opinion.  Commentary on *how* the film was made or what happened during the shot is what should be the commentary subject.<br />I'm glad I bought this for the study but I'm keeping my Moroder version for the impact.
6305079811|5.0|Quite simply the finest translation of the look and feel of a classic comic book/strip into film.  While we expect outrageous costumes, questionably obvious plots and characters inhumanly polarized along the lines of good and evil from a comic book, most film directors wouldn't have the guts to make such a literal translation as this.<br />This film delivers the look and feel of a comic book, and if we are even a little bit willing to allow ourselves to be taken on the journey, we soon find ourselves reading under a blanket with a flashlight at age 10 again, fantasizing about being the hero and about having the gorgeous heroine all to ourselves, even if we weren't exactly sure what we'd do with her, and even if she would still have cooties around our friends.<br />If you are willing to be taken on this journey back to your childhood, you'll love this film.
B00000AOUD|5.0|All I can say is this is the BEST album ever!!! I mean the absolute best!!! The only album I've heard that compares to taab is the Who's Tommy. The album cover is enough to keep a person amused. The lyrics are very poetic and meaningful. The music puts anyone with a taste for good talented music in a state of awe. All other Jethro Tull albums don't compare. Over 12 instruments played by 5 people. FLute, acoustic guitar, violin, sax, trumpet, lute, electric guitar, organ, piano, harpsichord, bass, timpani, drums, and other percussion.
0345448898|4.0|I loved the first two of these books, but the last one I didn't enjoy as much as the first two. The first book (The Golden Compass) introduces Lyra Silvertongue. You learn all about her life and world and it's very interesting. In the second book (The Subtle Knife) the author introduces Will Parry, a boy who finds Lyra and they stick together until the end of the series. The second book is very good as well and I thought the whole deal with the subtle knife was awesome! The third book (the amber spyglass) was okay, but I didn't like the whole plot and it just didn't seem as good to me as the first two. But if you want to understand the whole series then I suggest you read all of the books. It confused me for a while who the good people were and who the bad people were. All in all, the books are pretty good.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This album is truly showcasing Barbra's wide range of duetting attitudes: you have Streisand goin' country with Vince Gill, disco with Donna Summer, easy listening with Frank Sinatra and Barry Manilow (on a new song written by Richard Marx), R'n'B with Ray Charles, AC with Celine Dion, Kim Carnes and Bryan Adams and pop with Barry Gibb.<BR>But then let's not forget that she is an actress as well as a singer, so it ain't that peculiar finding a duet with Don Johnson or Kris Kristofferson.<BR>Yet, Barbra is not only a silver screen star, she's also a huge theatre stage talent, so here comes a duet with Michael Crawford and Johnny Mathis.<BR>With such a stellar resum, it is only fair TV gurus would give her due recognition thru TV specials, and so you find also a gem of a duet with the late Judy Garland.<BR>Barbra proves to be an everchanging work of art, one of the new duets is with Josh Gorban - although I know it should have been performed by Barbra and Andrea Bocelli...and i am still wondering why it did not come off like that at the last minute? Easy answer: Gorban is along-time David Foster proteg.<BR>Anyway: this album is very nidce collection of diverse genres and artists that put a feather in their caps by duetting with the most talented performer alive!

B00006JJ1O|5.0|The two girls in t.A.T.u. are great.  I read a review that said they are like prodigy, but the vocals and original music that these girls rock to is incredible!  They make music come alive and embrace it unlike anyone I've heard.  &quot;All the things she said&quot; was an instant catch when I heard it on the radio.  I had to find out who it was and where to buy it.  I had no idea the beautiful voices were matched by these two georgious girls.  Thier music is unmatched even by those who came before them.  I recommend t.A.T.u. to everyone who wants to enjoy a great new group!
B00006LLLN|5.0|Beautiful harmonies.  Rich, clear sounds for every voice and every instrument.  Perfect balance of tunes.  No matter what music you usually listen to, you should give this a try.

B00006AFUR|5.0|This album is a definate work of art. I was a fan of 30 Seconds To Mars for about two years before it came out and I had even heard the songs online before it was released, but that had no effect on me purchasing the album. Ever since I heard the first song by them I was telling everyone in my path about them. Believe it or not, this is one of the few albums that actually comes out and grabs your attention. To call this album perfect would be an understatement. I know a lot of people that aren't even into the whole rock music scene and they are fanatic about 30STM. The hardest thing about writing this review is explaning why it is so great and what artists are similar, because this is just one of those things you know? Trust me on this one, you won't regret this purchase!

B000077VR3|3.0|What a frustrating movie! This may be remembered as the film that hastened the return of musicals, and it features dazzling costumes, sumptuous colors, and imaginative film techniques, but there are so many problems that I came away feeling cheated.<br />It was a creative and daring idea to set a musical in 1900 Montmartre's famed \\"Moulin Rouge\\" using contemporary music of the late 20th century. Unfortunately, the film is seriously undermined by the lack of plot development, a contrived romance, and the have-it-both-ways mocking and celebratory treatment of the \\"Bohemian.\\"  The movie alternates between a tongue-in-cheek farce and a serious declaration of the importance of love and other ideals. When the company performs Madonna's \\"Material Girl\\" or \\"Like a Virgin,\\" it plays wonderfully as camp (except for the Duke's ridiculous mugging in the latter song). However, only Jim Broadbent as the master of ceremonies and manager of the nightclub consistently understands the difference between witty camp and lowbrow, diluted, burlesque.<br />The movie's very promising opening has Toulouse-Lautrec and Satie writing an absurd, avant-garde play, but their original idea for \\"Spectacular, Spectacular\\" is co-opted by the financier, the Duke (a buffoonish caricature who is simply too broadly loutish to believe). And yet, Toulouse-Lautrec and Satie still seem to love the production as much as the one they had originally planned. It would have been intelligent and fun to satirize the commercialism of the eventual play, but that opportunity is never taken. Musical tastes will differ, of course, but as the two lovers exchange snippets of love songs of the last 30 or so years, it feels like the pending CD was in mind. The songs that fit best (e.g., \\"Nature Boy\\") are repeated ad nauseum. OK, we get it! Kidman and McGregor are excellent given the material (although their characters' romance seems contrived). Both sing well, though Kidman, who often sounds too amped up, is best when singing softer, more intimate songs.<br />The art direction and sets are beautiful, and there's a luminescent caricature of Montmartre that recalls \\"Babe, Pig in the City.\\" Techniques reminiscent of early photography and silent movies are superbly done, but limited mostly to the beginning. There are also redundant shots of our woeful hero and the Paris skyline, and so much forced glitter and dazzle that it's like an overdose of the Disney electric parade. Conversely, the cuts are sometimes too quick; one yearns to bathe in more atmosphere. The moments of magic and beauty are too often offset by a banal plot, as well as hollow, self-congratulatory celebrations of freedom, truth, and love. As Satine declares, \\"diamonds are a girl's best friend,\\" but it feels like box office receipts have the upper hand here.ing softer, more intimate songs. <br />The art direction and sets are beautiful, and there's a luminescent caricature of Montmartre that recalls \\"Babe, Pig in the City.\\" Techniques reminiscent of early photography and silent movies are superbly done, but limited mostly to the beginning.

B000002HPV|4.0|This is the album that defines Bjork, they lyrics, the music, and every other aspect of it.  Though it can be rather monotomous at times, many songs are just to pure, true, and emotional to not love.  Pluto, is one of raw emotion and insanity, where the artist takes about a minute of screaming to show the audience the depth of her insanity and pain.  Many don't like her voice, but they can't deny the originality, emotion, and brilliance of her.
B000001DU5|5.0|This was a great collection when it was released in 1992 and musically, it still is, but now when I think about it, it could've been better. With only 12 songs and no altered versions of their hits especially the single version of &quot;I Believe&quot; this collection seems more like a cash-in but still it still is great with the title track. I think that the 2001 release collection is an improvement upon this one. Not a bad CD though.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|There really wasn't the best acting in this movie, but the impressions, camera work, and direction were amazing!  The use of sound and color really added something special to the direction.  For anyone who's actually done drugs before, this movie is like a chemically-induced experience.  It makes you understand and feel like you're involved with the movie.  There was a lot more here than just Jennifer Connelly's pretty face (although she is the most attractive junkie I've ever seen).  Check this movie out, it's great!

0425107469|5.0|This was an excellent book by Dean Koontz. Nomatter what age or genre of books you like this is a classic. This is about two escaped lab experiements, an human intelligent monster and a dog with human intelligence. The dog is being hunted by the monster and his ability to locate the dog. It has very great details and is a great story. I will continute to read Dean Koontz and his stories.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris hits the mark with this collection of essays on his eccentric childhood and even more eccentric adult life.  He is openly gay and his style could be offensive to some people -- he is very up-front about sex, swearing, drug use and so on -- but he doesn't set out to shock.  These are simply the facts of his life and he is happy to share them with you.  The stories about his drug use are very matter-of-fact about the real ups and downs of drug addiction.  He admits all of his own faults and almost dares you to disagree with his conclusions about his uselessness....and does it in prose so lyrical, so sweetly amusing, that you feel the world would indeed be a worse place without his skewed perspective.  Anyone who can read this book without howls of laughter is devoid of a sense of humor.  Highly recommended -- even if you are, as I am, a dyed-in-the-wool conservative.  I gave four stars instead of five only because I don't think I could re-read it repeatedly and still find it as funny.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Like every big movie star on the map Ben Affleck has his share of bad movies that no one cares about. Daredevil is not one of those movies. I was surprised to see that DD was entertaining from start to finish. Keep in mind that I'm hardly a comic book freak, in fact I've never read a comic book in my life. A sin perhaps..but oh well. It didn't stop me from enjoying the cool characters and style of this comic book turned film. Ben Affleck was surprisingly effective playing a super hero. I didn't picture it at first. He plays the title role. And causes no room for complain here. Colin Farrell plays the villian Bullseye. And although he wasn't on screen as much as you might think, he was quite a presence when he was. Now Jennifer Garner was a scene stealer as Elektra. She was worth the price of addmission alone. Rounding out the immpessive cast is Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin. I've heard others say he's about as scary as a giant teddybear. Well he is a great actor in my opionion and I thought he played the role very well. Once again not on screen as much as I expected. The main thing that DD does right is that the hero is the main focus like he should be. One complain about the Batman films was that the villians always outshined and over shadow'd the hero. That's not the case with Daredevil. FINAL WORDS: DD is an excellent action adventure film that can be enjoyed by old fans and new ones.  ..MOVIEBUFFS: Look for Kevin Smith in a cameo.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I could go in depth about how Yes has lost their youth and innocence since The Yes Album, or about how they hit a self-proclaimed rock bottom just a few months before this show, or about how the band has been altered so many times with the revolving door at the keyboard position.  When you hear the first overture of the orchestra, and the sounds of nature that open up Close to the Edge, none of this will matter to you.<br />This was the second of two shows played on back-to-back nights in Amsterdam featuring Wilhelm Keitel and the European Festival Orchestra, and the programme features Yes playing on a particularly good night for them.  Beautiful song selection and sequence, coupled with the depth and presence of the orchestra, make for a very exciting listen.<br />Epics, there are a few.  The aforementioned Close to the Edge, had it been sans symphony, would have been nothing in particular to cheer about.  Add the forty or so musicians behind then (many of which are cute ladies!) and a beautiful arrangement of strings, horns, and percussion, and you've got the makings of a truly breathtaking opener.  Steve's clean guitar tones and a mildly slower tempo give the song a mellower feel, albeit with reduced attack.<br />Gates of Delirium is another song that greatly benefits from having an orchestral arrangement behind it.  The substitution of synthed horns for a real horn section in the hectic middle section makes for a moving experience.  And just wait until you hear Soon with real strings behind it!<br />Both these songs, however, take a backseat to the night's magnum opus, Ritual.  Being a big fan of percussion, and having heard that the song featured not only an extended Alan White drum solo, but also a very Ritual-istic performance of the remaining band members banging on various drums, I could not help but sit at the edge of my seat throughout the thirty-minute performance.  I won't spoil anything, but this song will move you.  There is a part in the song where the camera angles purposely cut Steve out, and when he finally does come back in, it may bring you to tears!<br />Other highlights of the programme include a lilting version of In the Presence of, from the new Magnification disc, and a funky orchestra-driven Long Distance Runaround.  And You and I, though it has been a staple of most every Yes concert for the past thirty years, deserves a second listen with the orchestra behind it.<br />And I haven't neglected to mention Steve's guitar interlude in the middle of the evening.  We are treated to a live Mood for a Day, and a Steve Howe arranged version of Vivaldi's Lute Concerto.  Just watching Steve's fingers gracefully and precisely move about the fretboard is enough to inspire any prospective guitarist.<br />Low points, few as they may be, must be mentioned for the sake of contrast.  Owner of a Lonely Heart and Roundabout, the two songs that Yes typically closes EVERY concert with, have been done better on other live albums, notably House of Yes.  At some points the stereo mix favors the bass or vocals over guitar and keyboard.  Sometimes I find myself straining to hear Tom Brislin, tour keyboardist, above the symphony.<br />And about Tom: He seems like his life depends on an over-enthusiastic performance.  He bangs on his poor keyboards during Gates, and is overall too melodramatic.  Of course, this is given with the fact that he was probably just some kid who loves Yes, who was sitting in his basement plugging away at Wakeman's riffs when he got the call.<br />This concert shows Yes at its most grandiose, yet between songs at its most down to earth.  The documentary included is also a welcome reminder that Yes aren't just music making machines, they're just four (five) mortal men with incredible talent who put on a hell of a great live show.
0679411585|1.0|The review title says it all. Johnson-Nixon war drafts the<BR>poor or poorly educated youth from all over America's poverty<BR>stricken lands to venture over into an even more imporverished<BR>region of southeast Asia to punish an Asian people who<BR>more than anything else wanted to be independent (like we<BR>once were in l776). The Vietnamese hated French colonial rule!<BR>Were we so blind? And they hated America's betrayal at the<BR>end of WWII after Ho Chi Minh had fought alongside American<BR>forces to defeat the Japanese Imperial Army, an army that<BR>left 2,000,000 Vietnamese dead from starvation. But that's<BR>another story. The Japanese forced Vietnamese farmers to<BR>plant hemp for the war effort, effectively reducing the rice<BR>harvest to starvation levels (the pig share of the harvest<BR>going to Japan's brave imperial troops). And then we invited<BR>the cowardly French to return to Vietnam and rule once more.<BR>How many Vichy French who had bent over for Hitler came back to<BR>'rule' Vietnam we'll never know, but the U.S. gave these sick<BR>cowards the support they needed to fight the Viet Cong until<BR>'54. And then we began dumping bombs and agent Orange on<BR>the entire population 'to win the hearts and minds' of the<BR>freedom loving people of Vietnam. What a joke. The movie<BR>version stars Mel Gibson, an actor whose father fled with his<BR>family back to Australia in the early l960's just so his sons<BR>(including that grinning clown Mel) could not be drafted into<BR>Johnson's poor man army. How sentimental we are about this<BR>conflict in 2003!! Does anyone remember the deaths of possibly<BR>5,000,000 Vietnamese who died in a senseless ten-year long<BR>struggle for a nation state? If the U.S. had honored its <BR>wartime agreement with Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam would never<BR>seen such a bloody quagmire. And oh, those French, how loyal<BR>they proved since l945. Now they won't join us in our attempts<BR>to start Vietnam II, the Baghdad story. AnotherBright, Shining<BR>Lie.
B0000032LS|5.0|This album is chock full of catchy tunes that will stay in your head and keep you singing for days. From the hilarious &quot;Eddie&quot; (When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy you knew he was a no good kid) and &quot;Touch-A Touch-A Touch Me&quot; (Then if anything grows *giggle* while you pose) to the bawdy &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot; you will be on a wild ride. These people can SING! And let's not forget the all time classic dance anthem Time Warp. If you like rock and roll or just a good time this is a definite recommendation.
B00005A46T|4.0|If Slipknot had made IOWA any softer or exactly the same as the self titled. Sellout would've been labeled even more than it is is now. What i think makes Slipknot so appealing in the nu metal world is that Corey's lyrics aren't whiney. Instead of talking about how his dad hit him or mom grounded him for curfew. \\"I Am Hated\\" is the best example with his lyrics basically bashing those of the whiney, and saying his band just might be the savior for this genre. While it seems like a good idea for a song it doesn't really come out that great. \\"Disasterpiece\\" is definetly my favorite track on the record for Corey's (sic) lyrics, and the catchy guitar riffs you'll be humming to yourself the rest of the day. \\"Metabolic\\" is also another great and extremely underrated song on the album. Corey's lyrics are pretty good (for him)... \\"Heretic Anthem\\", and \\"Left Behind\\" I think try to hard to be scary and just come off lame if you ask me. One thing that just leaves me puzzled is how they need 9 members. Seriously 5 people in the band could make the same exact sound with 9. Yet overall a great album that anyone looking for aggression should be pleased with.
B000002KMY|5.0|I am sure glad to see I'm not the only one to prefer this over &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; the first Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio. That was a good album, but this is better--in fact, this is really, really good.<br />I've always found the drum and bass on Sabbath albums a bit sluggish, and while it always seemed to match the dark brooding songs, Vinnie Appice is a bit more energetic and I like that. The real star, though, is Tony Iommi, who is at his best on this album, whether on the slower tunes like &quot;Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; or the faster ones like &quot;The Mob Rules&quot;--wait, that is the only up-tempo song on the album, if you don't count &quot;Slipping Away,&quot; which is a throwaway standard rocker.<br />Someone on this page mentioned Dio's 'Dungeons and Dragons' thematics, and they were right. But I can live with it, it doesn't bother me too much, and fortunately Dio has the register and the volume to pull it off. Tenacious D may have claimed to have taken the torch from RJD, but they can't touch the vocals on this album.<br />I honestly can't tell if my CD is remastered (so it probably isn't), but I can tell you that it sounds great--sure you can do rock and roll using all the perks of studio equipment. Twenty-two years old now, &quot;Mob Rules&quot; stands as a classic, not as a replacement for the old Sabbath, but on its own. Bravo Martin Birch, bravo Sabbath--long live rock and roll.
B00005U2JL|3.0|I love Manson and i was really looking forward to showing my friends who hadn't seen him live what they were missing. The combinations of the three shows in songs were really annoying and frustrated me very quickly. I want to see just one show like Korn-live, Nine Inch Nails - And All That Could Have Been, or Metallica's S&amp;M where it showcases their energy and you see what their doing the whole time. What made up for this is the odd 30 minute documentary that was filled with backstage clips, interviews, and live footage. Overall i wouldn't recommend this DVD but to only the greatest Manson fans.
B00005LK94|5.0|The multiple chords struck by Carrol Ballard's heartbreaking work &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; are so universal, it is difficult to imagine a person of any gender or any age not being touched in some way by this genuine family film. Make no doubt, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is a true classic, timeless in beauty yet timely in theme. So many subjects are tackled, from estranged family dynamics to environmental messages, it is difficult to fully grasp this film's important impact from just one viewing. Each time I view this movie, I come away with new ideas, and a new hope for our common man and woman.<br />Film director Carrol Ballard has achieved such lofty heights before with his debut film &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; and his stunning follow-up &quot;Never Cry Wolf.&quot; Amazingly, he has once again climbed to the top of a very high mountain with &quot;Fly Away Home.&quot; The story is anything but simple, but its a tale of a mother, lost in a car accident, thereby forcing the reunion of a daughter and estranged father. He's an eccentric Canadian, living in the country, working on multiple sculptures and experimenting with flying machines. She's a lost soul, seemingly homeless without the guidance of her late mother. Yes, father (Jeff Daniels) and daughter (Anna Paquin) bond, but it's due to the nature which surrounds their rural homestead. In this case, an orphaned flock of geese Paquin raises from birth after the destruction of their natural habitat by encroaching development.<br />Paquin's character becomes a surrogate mother for these geese, and eventually she must learn to fly to enable the lost birds to travel south for the winter. Daniels accompanies his daughter out of love, and eventually understanding that this has become a rite of passage for his budding, maturing teenage girl. And somewhere along the way, a girl becomes a woman, and a father becomes a man.<br />Much of the credit for &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; goes to the brilliant cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who also worked with Ballard on &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; and &quot;Never Cry Wolf.&quot; Certainly the musical selection of Mary Chapin Carpenter's haunting &quot;10,000 Miles&quot; is an inspirational if not brilliant choice. But the story is the key, and during a time of changing family dynamics amidst a society of shrinking nature, I can't imagine a film utilizing both themes with such skilled and relevant ease.<br />&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is such an important film, not only because a female protagonist breaks away from traditional bonds to find herself (no boy and his dog here), but because a self-centered man/father overcomes his weaknesses to find not only himself, but the person/daughter/child who defines his soul. &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is about us finding our spirit during a trying time of divorce and misguided independent values. By bonding with the land, and as importantly with our family, we find our true spirit.<br />And finally, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; will bring a tear to the most hardened spirit, causing us to hug the ones we love, human or animal. Is that not the purpose of art - film, book, music or otherwise? I have applauded Carroll Ballard before. After &quot;Fly Away Home,&quot; I not only applaud this extraordinarily gifted director, I salute him.
0140067477|5.0|This was one of those rare books purchased for a college course that I simply refused to sell back.<br />Hoff's Tao of Pooh is a wonderful, easy to understand book on the basics of taoism. Pooh is the ultimate uncarved block, as the book illustrates.<br />It's so simple and easy to read, yet conveys concepts that takes other books on taoism several hundred pages and weeks of reading to even begin to understand.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I think that the new T.A.T.U cd is really good and worth buying. The cd is a new twist on dance/pop music. I think that these girls are going to be really big in the U.S. really soon
B00005A1PR|5.0|I love this CD, she is a great singer, song writer, and musician! The songs have great lyrics with deep meaning, the beats are all good, and the feel of this CD is one that makes me smile and wanna dance! She's very positive and smooth! I'd highly recommend getting this CD if you like even 1 of her songs! The whole CD is good in my opinion, and that is hard to find today!
1573225517|4.0|It's strange what happened with \\"High fidelity\\". Everybody talked so much about this book, saying it was excellent, intelligent, funny, etc; the movie was very good; most reviews at Amazon.com praised it as being an instant modern classic of the 90s. Well, I guess I was expecting too much, and, in the end, I was a bit let down.<br />In \\"High fidelity\\", Rob Fleming is author Nick Hornby's alter ego. Rob is in his mid-thirties; his friends, his girl-friends, a promising carrer, everything got stuck in his past. Now he's the owner of Championship Vinyl, a store that sells old albuns and records for rock-afficcionados, and his store is not doing so well. And, to top it all, his present girlfriend, Laura, has just left him for another man, older, hairier and who wears leather pants.<br />To face this separation, Rob starts to analyse what went wrong in his life. His mania is to make \\"Top 5 lists\\" of everything, and he tells the story in the book by reviewing the \\"Top 5 toughest break-ups in my life\\". Along with that, he reviews his relationship with his parents, with the only two co-workers at the store, and with an american folk-singer trying to make a career in London.<br />Nick Hornby writes freely, I felt his narration almost like a speech put into words, and that's nice. But Hornby created Rob as a too much bitter person, and sometimes I got tired of his winning and complaining about everything; that's why I didn't give \\"High fidelity\\" 5 stars.<br />What I think is good is that Hornby didn't attempt to analyse male life in the 90s too deeply (that was not the book's proposal, anyway). Hornby just exteriorized his own feelings and transformed them in this book.<br />Grade 8.1/10
0887306101|3.0|I bought Market Wizards because I am working at an Ibank trading bonds this summer. But what I found is not so much a book that tells about stochastics, models, spread swaps, or other technical stuff , but what I did find is a book that takes you into the mind of a trader. Some of these guys have made and lost millions in a day, and the thoughts that must go through their head are mind-boggling when you control millions of demanding investors' money. The value of Schwager's book lies in its potential to teach you about what mental qualities these guys all possess that make them such good traders. Using real-life examples, they preach seemingly easy tenets all traders should follow but often do not. A lot of these psychological mindframes are difficult to maintain - cutting losses, trading without emotion, confidence in positions, and above all, not to be greedy. The interview with Ed Seykota (consummate yet eccentric trader) almost makes the book worth the money. A lot of what they say seems very simple and straightforward, but until you manage millions like these guys have, you will have to settle with a vicarious lesson that teaches you these important mental traits. All of his lessons should be absorbed before you step onto the trading floor thinking you are going to own Wall Street.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Nemesis is a darker trek but yet still maintains the Star Trek spirt.  The ending will have you on the edge of your seat for the last 40 minutes, and it ends with a bang.  If this is the end of the TNG crew their will no disopointments, hopefully not thoe.  However I do think it is time for DS9 film!  It does lack the Undiscover Country sighing off at the end but the producer had no idea this would have been the next TNG movie. Nemesis has action, humor, romance, suspense and action again!
B00005U1YO|3.0|I feel that Come with Us was easily the most anticipated Chemical Brothers CD, but was also the most disappointing. I tend to like electronica albums that create a pattern or a theme throughout the CD that is chained together by a common vibe and sound. If you have ever listened to Underworld's Second Toughest in the Infants or Aphex Twin's selected ambient works, then you know what I am talking about. Electronica that spans so many different styles like these producers do cannot be seamless like Digweed on the decks, but it can be unifying and complete. This one just lost me halfway throughout the CD and never grabbed my attention again. There are some standout tracks that deserve some praise: I love Star Guitar and Come with us is definitely a good song. But these guys have done much better in the past, and they are even better playing live. I just hope that these veterans of electronica who have contributed so much to the genre aren't over the hill because this one sure gave me that impression.
B000075BFK|5.0|tupac is the greatest mc of all time and will always be the greatest. nobody is even on the same level as him. when somebody can drop albums like pac did 2 or 3 in a year, and then every song on every album is good. then you can start comparing them to pac. but nobody can be like pac. if pac was still here half of the fake rappers like jay z, ja rule etc. wouldn't be successful, cause pac would clown on them and take over everyone!! and if he was sill here i know for a fact jay z wouldn't be taking some of his music for his songs, and that goes for nas too. anyways the cd is awseome, if you don't have it go get it, and i can't wait for pac to make his return he's going to rule the world again!!!!!!!!!!!! peace!
B0000020C4|5.0|If you only buy one Les Mis CD then BUY THIS ONE!!  Granted it is not the complete version (ok so you'll have to go buy that one too) but just the raw talent of the performers on this recording is amazing.  <br />Philip Quast has one of the most powerful voices that I have ever heard and it fits perfectly with Javert's character.  &quot;Stars&quot; is my favorite song mainly for that reason.<br />Colm Wilkinson of course is the best Valjean out there.  Sometimes his little rips at the end of a sustained note are annoying but his performance of &quot;Bring Him Home&quot; is the best.<br />And finally Lea Salonga is simply perfect as Eponine.  She has a powerful yet very sweet voice that conveys Eponine's sadness without sounding whiny.  Her performance of &quot;On My Own&quot; is nothing short of FANTASTIC and is giving Quast's performance of &quot;Stars&quot; a run for its money in my mind.  Lea Salonga is quickly becoming one of my favorite singers and this recording is what first got my attention about her.  <br />Overall, this recording is the best Les Mis recording out there.  To get the whole story buy the Complete Symphonic Recording but for just pure enjoyment in listening, you MUST get this one!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones, one of the most amazing pop singers of all time, won 5 grammys. She deserved every single one of them. She has a wonderful voice, great lyrics, and an amazing score of music. The most amazing album of the year!
1563890119|5.0|This was a very good book that I would recommend to anyone. As of writing this review I haven't read any of the later volumes, but based on how good the first one was, and some of the other reviews here, I can't wait.
0066214122|2.0|This is the first M.C. book I read. It was kind of fun, especialy liked the cliff-hanger parts on the end of the chapters. I almost expected a commercial after each.<BR>Michael Crichton delivers a fun book, but not a very well written book. I frowned. She frowned. They frowned. GET IT!?<br />If anyone is a Next Generation fan (Star Trek), you will be able to guess most of the book. Those crazy &quot;Nanites&quot;, were able to do so much in such a little time.  I kept expecting to see the Terminator 2 robot pop up somewhere in this book. <br />Once again, just like alot of his work, scientific advances go haywire in a secret isolated environment. I read the book. I frowned.<br />The ending is pure Hollywood.

B00006JJ2Y|5.0|While ex-Velvet Undergroud mastermind John Cale was spilling his drunk soul and Guts on a smaller stage, a drunker VU mastermind Lou Reed found new ways to dump on his loyal fans. This is Reed at his absolute worst - musically this is a live non-show - Lou never gives his great band a chance. As a live comedy document this is unforgettable corny fun. It must be a comedy record. It HAS to be, as the music seems an afterthought. I can't imagine how the backing band felt - they probably felt \\"just play\\". And they do, quite well. Lou would rather heckle the audience. Constantly.<br />And it IS funny. Reed's quips and barbs are the equal of any 'Hee-Haw' episode. It's a live laff riot. I loved it when Lou Reed (being drunk and all) slurred and mentioned Groucho Marx. I didn't think he would but BAMM! classics speak for themselves. He gives Rupert Pupkin (Scorcese's \\"King of Comedy\\") a run for his money.<br />The cheap jokes here are funny in their bitchy and cheap way. But you wanna good one? That same year Johnny Rotten & the Sex Pistols were launching a punk revolution, inspiring countless bands to express anger/helplessnes/isolation. Very much Velvet Underground material. I just wish Lou Reed was there to see it. I guess he was already booked, playing a drunk burn-out. He performed that role exceptionally well. Betcha he doesn't listen to this blasted diary much. But I do - you haven't heard a \\"Walk On the Wild Side\\" like the version here.
B00003CY0V|3.0|You remember that Berry, Travolta and Hugh starred in it but that's about all you will remember! It's an entertaining movie but it's not a great film that demands repeated viewings.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin's BBC Sessions to me is as essential as Zoso. This two cd set shows how good Zeppelin gets live and all the energy they pack with it. Some of these tracks I almost prefer to the studio such as: Immigrant Song, Heartbreaker, etc. For me, hearing and seeing Jimmy Page whip out the bow and do his thing on Dazed And Confused is almost heaven. This cd is great for Zeppelin fans who want to know how they were live and what made them one of the greatest bands of all time.
B00003CXCK|5.0|This is a triumph for Spielberg and a cinematic masterpiece that will inspire for generations to come. Watching this black and white movie was an extremely unforgettable experience. The story, the cast, the scenes, the tragedy, the emotions - they were absolutely compelling. The irony of Oskar Schindler, entrepreneur and womaniser, becoming a saviour to the Jews bespeaks the goodness inherent in the corrupted human nature. Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes do superlative work here ably supported by the splendid supporting cast. There are scenes that are forever etched in our hearts and minds:<BR>1. Naked women awaiting their fate in a large room.<BR>2. Ralph Fiennes with Jewish maid in the kitchen.<BR>3. Girl in red being victimised.<BR>4. Children hiding in sewage pits.<BR>5. New factory worker escapes death.<BR>6. Oskar witnessing the massacre.<BR>7. The typing of Schindler's list.<BR>8. Random killing of people.<BR>9. Hosing the people in the train with water. <BR>10. Oskar's emotional outburst at the end and his accountant's equally emotional reassuring word. <br />Virtually everything is top-notched.

But listen to what Amazon offers you for clips, and make up your own mind.<br />After not listening to Nada Surf for years, this album makes me reconsider my earlier and self-indulgent dismissal of the band as fun, but Sebadoh-ulacra. They also put on a really good show in New Haven circa the maligned \\"Popular\\" (an indie playah-hatah song that even the playah-hatahs hated...what gives?).
630512762X|5.0|This movie is fabulous and bears repeated viewings. It showcases what John Woo is capable of. Travolta and Cage has never been better. Joan Allen was a delight. It's action-packed and has a story that you won't forget for years. In this film, you have to identify with the characters more than you identify with the actors, an incredible change. It works!
B000088E6D|4.0|Could this CD be the breakout product that will indicate the advent of a new musical trend? Will 2003 be the year marking the end of the &quot;boy band&quot; trend in the music industry? Due to massive success of NORAH JONES and now MICHAEL BUBLE, pop appears to be heading in a new direction. Michael Buble has a superb vocal style. His vocal style is closer to legendary MEL TORME than HARRY CONNICK JR. However, there is one negative comment about this CD...the musical production by DAVID FOSTER. The arrangements have not enough RAW emotional imput and are over the top dripping in far too much sugar! What could have came been a cool new &quot;POP/JAZZ&quot; CD only sounds like a &quot;LOUNGE ACT&quot; from  the FLAMINGO HOTEL thanks to Mr. Foster !
B00005YW4H|1.0|This artist is the absolute epitome of a corporate marketing machine at work.  <br />Norah Jones is no different (and no better) than the average coffee shop singer/songwriter that you can find on a Friday night at the local coffee joint in your city.<br />But...because she has big record industry backing (ie. money), a popular musician father, and most importantly...the good looks...she's winning the Grammy's.   Pretty sad, that our musical tastes are not richer than this as we settle for whatever is shoved down our throats.  And then, you add a cover of a Hank Williams Sr. tune?...well, that's a no brainer.<br />I am not a disgruntled musician trying to get my break...just an avid music fan, who is really disappointed in the state of the music industry and tastes of today.  <br />I'm also not an old fuddy-duddy who only has classical tastes.  Or a teenager who's mad at the world.   But as an example, I have to say, Eminem's latest c.d. was absolutely remarkable in originality, production, and design.....and should receive much more positive attention than a bread and butter Norah any day.  Or how about all of the the remarkable jazz recordings that hit the shelves this past year?<br />Dig deeper people, you'll be surprised at what you find...
B00006IUNN|1.0|This movie is not an appropriate movie for teenagers or anyone who doesnt like violence or gore.  Its far to bloody and gross in my opinion.  Seeing some guy getting his head chopped off or people getting blown up is a sick thing to show.
B0000797IO|4.0|Jennifer Aniston breaks out of her \\"Friends\\" persona to play a bored housewife desperately trying to make a change in her life. Aniston totally transforms herself to play this role. Not just in terms of adopting a southern accent, but also in terms of body language. Jennifer moves and behaves in ways that we have never seen her before and should be commended for it. Another notable aspect of her performance is her ability to get the audience to root for her despite some questionable choices her character makes in the film. She deservedly got an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead.<br />The film is peppered with a host of interesting characters as a result of Mike White's off beat screenplay. He's written some very funny lines here. Tim Blake Nelson, who plays \\"Bubba\\" in the film, get one of the bigger laughs with the line, \\"I want to be a slut. A lesbian slut.\\" Another one comes after \\"Justine\\" (Aniston) when she asks Jake Gyllenhaal's character why his parents call him \\"Tom\\" instead of \\"Holden,\\" that she knows him by. You'll have to see the film for that one.<br />There some intriguing plot developments that take the viewer on an unpredictable ride to the finish. Without giving away the ending, I'll just say that it is not a \\"Hollywood\\" one. This may not sit well with the crowd that likes formulaic \\"by the book\\" stories.<br />Overall, \\"The Good Girl\\" is a film for someone looking for something off beat, off center and very funny.
B00005RHGK|5.0|At a time when the &quot;Scream&quot; wave has left every teen horror film in its wake awash in tongue-in-cheek tributes, self-aware teen heroes and killers who learned their trades from movie monsters, &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is an eerie return to old-fashioned scary movies. You get the sense writer/director Victor Salva really takes this seriously. People got bent out of shape because they showed what the creature looked like, but that is rediculous, it didn't take away from the film's atmosphere. BUY IT!!
B000071ZZI|5.0|Great movie. Learning about the hero as he learns about himself makes it far more interesting than the average movie.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is an old-fashioned spooker that owes as much to Steven Spielberg's Duel as it does to Tobe Hopper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Behold the film's mesmerizing opening sequence: a car, a Winnebago and a rusty truck partake in a maddening game of highway peek-a-boo. When the film's terrifying Mr. Creepers starts shedding his skin, the film is compromised by cheeky climax best appreciated by fans of camp. Trish (Gina Philips) and Darryl (Justin Long) are the poster children for the Curiosity Killed the Cat generation. They head back into Creepers territory once they've successfully dodged his road rage. Director Victor Salva keeps the excitement going despite fumbling with the been-there-done-that self-reflective humor (&quot;You know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it? Well, this is it&quot;). Surely, the film's rest-stop set piece must count as one of the more impressive moments of the year. Mr. Creepers plays tongue-hockey with a police officer's severed head. In the background: a sign celebrating the deliciousness of meat. This is seriously underated, and all because they revealed what the monster looked like. Come on people, that didn't completely destroy the atmosphere, you're overeacting. Anyway this one you must watch with the lights off.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen.  This is all I will say for fear of starting to spill and going over the 1000 word limit.<BR>Yep, simply the best.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Yes there are some flaws in this film, but who cares, they're not as big a deal as some pathetic 1 star reviewers try to make it out to be. They let one little thing ruin an entire movie for them. Listen to me and watch this one alone in the dark!
0553103547|4.0|I must admit I almost stayed away from this series after noticing the length of the books.  However, I finished this one in just a few weeks. By contrast, LOTR took me almost a year to read when I first read it.  For the modern reader, this book flows nicely despite the length.  Much going on and it is surprisingly fast paced.  Very well done.  The uniqueness is the blurred lines between good and evil.  I find myself rooting for the Imp, even though I know he is supposedly on the wrong side.  However, shy away from this if you can't stomach a more blunt and graphic style of writing.  By this I refer to the detailed scenes involving sex, rape, and a few of the battle scenes.  However, it makes this series seem more realistic and makes it stand out from the author's contemporaries.  And if you do not like the \\"all points of view\\" style like the movie \\"traffic,\\" stay away from this one (the shifting back and forth can be disruptive when something good happens right at the end of a chapter, and the story moves to another character). It's not for everyone, but finally a quality fantasy book is available that is not meant for children.  I like it, and if what I hear is true about Clash of Kings, I'll fly through that one even faster.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers was a surprise to me, I didn't know what to expect in this movie. The plot holes of the movie are there to allow the director to make a sequel. Along with the intense atmosphere, and with confident style and low-budget ingenuity, Jeepers Creepers gets under your skin, provoking spine-tingling horror when college siblings Trish and Darry encounter a flesh-eating demon along a barren rural highway. After a harrowing car chase that sets the movie's nerve-wracking tone, they investigate suspicious activity near an abandoned church, where a corrugated pipe leads to unimaginable horrors. This is a great and SCARY horror film that I would recommend to anyone. Watch it alone in the dark!

B00005RHGK|5.0|This is a very scary movie, and a heck of alot scarier than that crappy Scream, Valentine, and I Know What You did Last Summer. This isn't some stupid hip teen flick, no this is the down and dirty good old fashion horror film. You must watch this film alone in the dark!
0151008116|3.0|The book was an entertaining read; however, I thought the author failed to select one theme and follow it through.  For example, prior to his shipwreck experience, Pi becomes intimately involved with a variety of religions.  The shipwreck, lost at sea journey, could have been a journey into each such religion resulting with the young man finding himself and truth, or not.  Instead, the religion theme is left on the shore, and the shipwreck experience becomes a story of man versus animal, taming venture.  Also, I thought the book, although fictional, was believable, until the carnivorous island scene.  The author had many good thoughts, just too many for one book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Smooth.....Jazzy....Original!  I don't know if her first release deserved the acclaim it received with awards, I just know that I like it very much!
B00008HCCF|5.0|NOTE: There are two extras on this DVD that aren't mentioned on the Amazon.com discription - an encore of \\"Tennessee Waltz\\", and the music video for \\"Come Away With Me\\"<br />Norah Jones is one of those great music success stories - blessed with talent (and looks), seriously approach to her art, and knowing of her strong points. All of these factors, and more, come together in this live show.<BR>Recorded at the House Of Blues in October 2002, Norah and \\"The Very Handsome Band\\" don't stray too far from what worked so successfully on her incredible debut. Most of the songs from \\"Come Away With Me\\" are presented, along with 4 tunes added for this show.<BR>This is a very quiet show, which allows the focus to remain on Norah's gorgeous singing and wonderful piano playing. Favorites like \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"Nightingale\\" and \\"One Flight Down\\" sound great in a live setting (as if there would be any doubt). If you are a fan of the album, you'll truly enjoy this show.<BR>Of the four new tunes, Norah is at her vocal best on \\"Bessie Smith\\", a wonderful blues tune with great drum work by Andrew Burger. \\"Something Is Calling You\\" is a beautiful song as well, with an excellent bass line. And the version of \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" which Norah uses for an encore sounds much sadder than many versions of this song, but works wonderfully.<BR>This is truly step 2 in the making of a major star - with a new album (supposedly) coming this fall, this DVD makes a nice in-between step for those of us that have been captured by Norah's talent. You won't have a moment's disappointment watching this show, but definitely catch her live this summer if you have a chance.
0316096199|4.0|I am an East Boston High School student from Massachusetts and I personally think this memoir is fairly interesting. It is difficult to understand how the people around Alice handled that situation. I feel that there was not enough explanation for the reader to comprehend their reactions. It is awesome how the author is not afraid to express her thoughts and feelings. By the end of the book, my disappointment was in that she did not give enough information about what happened after her obstacles with struggling were gone. Overall, I would recommend this memoir; it benefits people in that it helps them to express their feelings comfortably and helps their understanding of others.
B00006NSGX|5.0|An excellent album! Nice transition from acoustic to electric. The DVD was breathtaking, such talent is truly awe inspiring. I think Layla truly stands out on this album as one of my favorites, particularly the intro. Wow! Great CD/DVD combo, rush out and buy it, you won't be sorry.
B00005JLZL|3.0|\\"The Life Of David Gale\\" is a captivating account of one man's life in prison, where David Gale is serving a sentence for a horrendous sexual crime. Although Kevin Spacey pulls off a believable performance in a starring role, this feature contains a lot of loose ends left for the viewer to tie together - therefore, with the plotline containing several huge, gaping holes. In short, the storyline will leave the viewer thinking \\"What the hell?\\" in certain points of the movie. The various adjectives (sprayed in graffiti form), such as \\"ANGER\\", \\"FEAR\\", \\"ECSTASY\\" (whatever), etc., that appear between the plot sequences and the interview scences do not help piece everything together very clearly, either. This, as well as \\"...David Gale\\"'s\\" dragginess quality will not win many popularity contests with the average viewer, neither. So, even though this picture's negative points far outweigh what little it has going for it, the positives contained within are the horrific and disturbing scenes, which, unfortunately, are the only ones that are most likely to grab whatever brief and undivided attention this film will afford to give you. The only other bright spot which gleams the brightest here, are the Oscar-caliber performances of its two stars, Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet, whose performance (of the latter) here hasn't been this stunning since the 1998 monster flick \\"Titanic\\". But, despite these two actors' outstanding performances, it stil isn't enough to save this picture from potential gloom and doom. That spells trouble (with a capital \\"T\\") at the box office, which makes \\"...Life...\\" that much more unfulfilling.
0066214122|2.0|The premise is promising--a secretive startup firm becomes the first company to manufacture commercial quanitites of simple nanobots that can perform a complex funtion as a swarm, and they get loose. However, the kind of havoc they wreak increasingly strains credibility, despite the author's repeated descriptions of the \\"emergent behavior\\" that a rapidly evolving swarm is capable of. The ending is so outrageously over-the-top that it reads like the script of an amateurish B movie. What a shame because Mr. Crichton could have concocted a less fantastic, but ultimately more deadly and interesting menace.
B0000640VO|3.0|This movie is shot beautifully, and is very cute,<BR>but the main character is a stalker.<BR>The film tries to pass off Amelie's behavior<BR>as socially acceptable and unthreatening,<BR>even romantic and charming,<BR>but the movie only works because <BR>Audrey Tautou is so cute.<br />While watching this movie in the theater,<BR>I had to constantly repress the urge to yell<BR>\\"Run!

B0000203YT|4.0|It´s a lovestory with convincing actors, especially the two main characters(played by Joseph Fiennes&amp;Gwyneth Paltrow) and Judi Dench in her role of Queen Elizabeth I. <BR>The audience gets an relatively realistic insight into the Elizabethan Age and its culture as far as this is possible in a movie. <BR>The lovestory with Shakespeare has parallels to &quot;Romeo&amp;Juliet&quot; that is written by Sh. during the movie.<br />Result: Not my favorite one but quite nice
0767812166|5.0|Though made almost 20 years ago, this incredible movie never fails to move me every time I view it. John Carpenter has shown his multi talents and ability to create a masterpiece outside of his traditional genre and the stars Karen Allen and Jeff Bridges gave Oscar-deserving performances (at least the community had the smarts to nominate Bridges for Best Actor). A somewhat implausable theme of an alien visitor assuming the body of a deceased man allows Bridges to enchant his audience with his &quot;becoming human&quot;. His teacher (Ms Allen) exemplifies the purity of the true human spirit in all of its kindness and truth. Starman is able to appreciate the purity of spirit and in the supporting cast we see our foibles mixed with what makes humankind so special in it's purest form. This is a love story that transcends all others and a masterpiece that might make you feel good about being a member of the human race...Bridges sums it up when comparing humans to other life forms he has observed in the universe with &quot;what makes humans different is... that you are at your very best when things are at their worst&quot; So true...so thought provoking! We owe Ms. Allen's Jenny Hayden character much thanks for showing us at our best and Mr. Bridges for showing us how to acknowledge the heart and grow to feel human love.

B000001A3H|5.0|I first became aware of &quot;stoner rock&quot; when I purchased the first Queens of the Stone Age cd.  This of course led me to Kyuss.  &quot;Blues for a Red Sun&quot; is the quintessential &quot;stoner&quot; CD of the 90's.  It is a must have.  I don't beleive anyone has done it as well or better than this CD (and that includes QOSTA, and UNIDA, and Hermano etc.)  The only problem with the CD might be its production.  Although stoner is supposed to be fuzzy etc, I believe this CD could benefit greatly from remastering.  I think the overall recording level is a little low, and your listening experience can be greatly enhanced by listening to it on a quality stereo system and tweaking the sound a little.  I generally listen to it in my car on a Bose 7 speaker system and turn up both the treble and the bass a little and push the volume to 11. Awesome.

B000084T18|5.0|This album is pure heat.  Of course if you like Ja or anything like that radio mess you ain't gonna like it.  That seems to be the case with all those out there sayin it's average at best. Y'all need to put the LL Cool J album down and look for your inner thug.  50 wasn't tryin to make stuff for you to listen to on you 6x9's as you cruise around in your Chevy Malibu, this album is for the thugs rollin' through the hood in the Caprice with the tinted windows on dubs.  So if that ain't you, stay off here dissin' a album that's pure gold.  With tracks like 4,6,10, and 18, this album tells bout the life in the hood.  So suburbians with white picket fences and flamingoes in the yard beware.  Eminem, Dre, Nate Dogg all on one album with 50.....it don't get better than that.
0385335482|5.0|I picked this book up while searching for a little something to read because its bright colors caught my eye. Boy, am I glad I did. From page one until the very end, I found myself routing for Becky to pull through. Through the times when it's inevitable that she is going to completely embarass herself, I found my eyes squinched and face blushing, as though I was there suffering the same embarrassments. With it being around 310 pages, you may find yourself thinking \\"well i just don't have time for this,\\" but trust me, you do! I picked it up last night, started reading it, and after finally being able to unglue it from my hands to go to sleep, I realized that I had read over half of it, and I definately didn't want it to end. I then completed it this morning after a dreaded standardized test, and it definately brightened my day. All in all, I would say that it took me about 5 hours total to read. If you want a book that'll keep you going, laughing, flushing with embarrassment, and feeling as if you are there with the character, than this is the book for you. I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND!
038572179X|3.0|What has made this novel so appealing to many readers is clearly lost on me.  Alot of it is quite slow, especially the middle section, and I felt no empathy for the characters.  Although a great deal of the book is internal monologue (a technique which I usually enjoy and when used well, as with Woolf, can be invaluable), I still ended up feeling that the characters were 2 dimensional.  The only exception being possibly Cecila.  I didn't hate the character of Briony (I wish I had!), I just didn't care about her or her problems.<br />The end of the novel does contain the punch.  The only problem is, for the punch to have any effect, you have to have something invested in the characters.  Unfortunately I didn't.  Worth a read, but not on the top of my list.
B00003CXXM|4.0|The story of 'The Bourne Identity' for me is Matt Damon's complete believability as title character Jason Bourne.  I didn't doubt for a second his 'fit' as a top-notch secret agent, capable of all manner of physical confrontation and quick-witted mental acuity.  He also sold me on the all-important case of 'amnesia' that drives the film.<br />I also thought Damon was eye-openingly good in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' especially given it was essentially the polar opposite of the celebrated South Boston poster boy he portrayed so perfectly in 'Good Will Hunting.'<br />Then, I try to imagine buddy Ben Affleck in each of these roles.  Laughable.  Keep your distance, Matt.  Smart career move.<br />The other story here is the continued maturation of director Dougie Liman.  [Son of late legal titan Arthur Liman, he of the famous unruly combover...and unlikely star of the Oliver North hearings.]  Liman takes a huge step here.  His previous films were 'Go' and 'Swingers.'  Nice *little* pictures, but Dougie has obviously been called up to the majors.  He hits a bases-clearing double in his first at-bat.
0060090383|5.0|Keyes proves herself a mistress of the understated romance - this is a great book, and a great fun read at the same time. I found it hard to put down simply because it was so much fun.<br />There are two parallel stories - we start with Rachels' Accidental overdose in New York. Her panicked parents whip her back to Ireland to put her into the Cloisters which Ireland's answer to the Betty Ford Clinic. Rachel decides she'll go for the holiday (and to meet famous people, and have sea weed wraps) - after all - how can she be a drug addict - she isn't thin enough!<br />The parallel story which is told in conjunction with her time in the Cloisters - is one which started 6 months earlier in New York when she met Luke.  This is the lovely story of the development of their romance. The wonderful thing about this story is that it deepens as the novel goes on and more is revealed about what is real and what is imaginery both for Rachel and her fellow inmates at the Cloisters.<br />Keyes has a very light and humourous hand, but she can also write the rest when it is necessary and she handles this story with incredible dexterity. I have great affection for her as a writer, and the characters she writes of. I am thrilled to find, to, that she has written at least one other book about the characters in Rachel's family - I'll be looking out to read that one next.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This CD brings out SOAD pushing open the envelope on its music ability.  Of course there is the usual SOAD fare, brought out on many of its songs.  But there is a tender side to this band of raging musicians, brought out on HIGHWAY SONG, ROULETTE, and STREAMLINE.<BR>SOAD can be described as this century's Black Sabbath.  Like the British kings of metal, SOAD boasts a carismatic and unique lead vocalist, a searing, very able guitarist, a pounding, unrelenting bass and drum section, and songs that change pace and beat often without much or any warning.  The best thing that SOAD has is its message, which many of my peers has derided as too simplistic for &quot;our complicated world.&quot;  I would'nt say that a SOAD world is utopia, but our country and our world would do well to pay attention to its simple message of better policy on the issues.
0738206679|5.0|In &quot;Linked&quot; Barab&aacute;si takes us on a winding journey from the beginnings of graph theory to the new science of networks advocated by him and his peers. This book examines all manner of networks, ranging from the Internet and the World-Wide Web to social and economic networks to gene regulatory networks. What is fascinating about the work conducted by Barab&aacute;si and others are the &quot;universal laws&quot; that tie these seemingly disparate networks together. This book brings together the work of Barab&aacute;si's research group and the work of others in the field of network science.<br />Barab&aacute;si writes with a clarity that some would argue is rare in works of a scientific nature. He explains his work in clear English, relegating any mathematical equations to footnotes for those who are interested. Power-law degree distributions and their relation to scale-free networks are at the core of his research, and thus he devotes much of the sixth chapter explaining what power-laws are, and how to identify them should you come across one in a plot of your data.<br />Of course, this is a book for the masses. It is not a text book. As such, he glosses over many of the intricate details and mathematics essential for a deep understanding of scale-free networks and related topics. But the book loses nothing at all by omitting these details. Rather, it allows the reader to see the much bigger picture (the underlying relationships between all kinds of different networks) which was obviously the overriding goal of this book. The book is concluded by more than thirty pages of notes, which the curious reader may peruse to obtain references to scientific publications which examine some of the concepts in much more detail.<br />The book is slightly repetitive, but this is perhaps inevitable when one considers the central thesis of this book: take any naturally occurring network, and the chances are it is scale-free. Thus, every direction the book takes leadsback to scale-free topologies!<br />I would have preferred to see a little more detail. But that said, Barab&aacute;si succeeds in his stated goal of taking the reader on a trip across disciplines and challenging the researcher to think in terms of networks.

B00005N5VO|5.0|Along with the less-gritty, fashionably crafted \\"Bullitt,\\" \\"The French Connection\\" set the stage for many crime dramas that followed, and epitomized the genre of the brutal detective story.<br />A slightly fabricated account of a true drug bust made by real-life New York City narcotics officers Eddie \\"Popeye\\" Egan and \\"Sonny\\" Grosso in the early 60s, \\"The French Connection\\" stars Gene Hackman as Popeye Doyle, a gruff cop who hates drug pushers with a passion, paired with his loyal, sensible partner Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider in one of two breakthrough roles landed in 1970). After a \\"hunch,\\" the two ruthless narcotics officers tail a greaser (Tony Lo Bianco) whom they find is connected to a big-time drug broker (Harold Gary). Soon, Popeye and Cloudy have stumbled onto what appears to be an imported heroin deal headed by French gentleman-brute Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), dubbed Frog One. The plot unfolds to reveal a complicated conspiracy to smuggle 120 pounds of heroin into New York City from France. Once Popeye grabs the case, he doesn't let go, even at the discouragement of his boss (played by the real-life Popeye Egan), all leading to a vigorous and relentless investigation.<br />\\"The French Connection\\" is brilliantly directed by the then-great William Friedkin (he won the Best Director Oscar), using a unique 'induced-documentary' style that captures the seedy underbelly of New York City, and the real-life story itself. The flawless improvised dialogue is what makes the film so real, topped off by the gritty Oscar-winning performance of Hackman, aided faithfully by nominee Scheider. The movie is one of the most realistic, genuinely engaging crime dramas ever made, capturing the tension among the officers in the beareau, and sheer passion and frustration of the 'good guys,' obsessed with getting their man. Though \\"The French Connection\\" seems heavily fictionalized when compared to the real case, it remains as real as a crime drama can get...despite a gripping pure-Hollywood car chase that sent the film over-budget.ollywood car chase that sent the film over-budget.
0805211063|5.0|Translation means everything! Over the years I've read much of Kafka especially during adolescence and into my early twenties when his worldview spoke most directly to my own attempts to understand how the world really worked. Of all his books only The Castle totally defeated me. I must have begun it five times in my life, only to abandon it partway through. Now I know why. It wasn't Kafka. It was the translation.<br />Mark Harmon's translation brought Kafka close to my ear and heart, the way he used to when I was younger. I could see the darkness of his interiors, feel the cold of his snow covered wind blown exteriors, smell the stale beer of the taproom, taste the small meals and strong coffee served, sense the animal []attractions of his characters. Most of all I could really hear the voices of his people as they simultaneously revealed and concealed themselves through their stories.<br />Sometimes I laughed out loud. Sometimes my hair stood on end at the dark realities which this book unveils. The Barnabas family stories in particular chilled me. Especially in this time of fear and shunning by powerful majorities of the 'others'in our societies and in the exhaustion of the 'cleansings' and genocides of the last century, the fall of that family made me feel like I was inside a hateful part of our past, present and future.<br /><br />I've now lived part of my life within bureaucratic organizations, even as an 'official' and I understand as I couldn't as a youth how absolutely Kafka has gotten to the deepest truths about how our power structures work. What it's like to be enmeshed as part of them, and-or to be at their mercy. It is hard to find free space in the world.<br /><br />I used to think Kafka was a genius and an artist of the highest rank. Now, reading him in an excellent translation I understand that he was also a prophet.

B00005JLF5|5.0|In 1993, The creative elements of Star Trek The Next Generation sought to capture lightening in a bottle for a unprecedented third time, and see if they could launch a successful third Star Trek series. Buoyed by the runaway success of the earlier Star Trek The Next Generation, the creative team sought to provide viewers a look at the Star Trek universe that was different from the typical Federation point of view.<br /><br />  Towards this end, the new series, Deep Space 9, was set on a space station orbiting the war-ravaged world of Bajor. A planet whose inhabitants are a bit leery of their provisional government inviting the Federation to oversee the station as they attempt to rebuild their planet from 50 years of brutal occupation by the Cardassians.<br /><br />  If this sounds a bit complex for a star Trek series, you are right, deep Space 9 was easily the most complex and diverse Star Trek show ever created, as characters and storylines unfolded over the shows seven seasons with many twists and turns, keeping viewers guessing. The idea of the show was to introduce conflict back into the series, as the Trek creator Gene Roddenberry insisted prior to his death that there would be no conflict between humans in the 24th century. To honor the late creators wishes Deep Space 9 centered on a multi-species cast, many of whom had very different value systems and beliefs that caused friction between the characters as well as set the stage for character development.<br /><br />  The show was lead by Avery Brooks as Commander Ben Sisko, a career Starfleet officer who is struggling to raise his son after the loss of his beloved wife to the evil Borg. He is a disillusioned man who is not happy about being assigned to a station in a remote system and is even less happy with the conditions facing him at the station.<br /><br />His second in command is Major Kira (Nana Visitor), a former freedom fighter who is assigned to be the Bajoran liaison to Starfleet on the station, and not happy at all with the Starfleet presence in her system.<br /><br />Jadzia Dax (Terry Farell) is a young science officer who holds a symbiotic organism with the experiences and memories of 800 years and several lifetimes. A past host was a close friend and mentor to Sisko.<br /><br />Julian Bashir (Siddig El Fadil), a bright, yet cocky young doctor who desires to make a name for himself on the wild frontier of space.<br /><br />Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney), the former Operations officer on the Enterprise who is assigned to head up the operations of the station.<br /><br />Odo  (Rene Abuerjonois), A shape shifting security chief of the station as well as the only known member of his species. Odo is a caustic loaner yet faithful to justice and determined to jail Quark and find the nature of his origins.<br /><br />Quark (Armin Shimmerman), a scheming and opportunistic Ferengi bartender who has his hands into everything and never misses a chance to make a profit, even if it means bending the law.<br /><br />  The first season set includes a number of classic episodes such as the classic \\"Duet\\" where Kira confronts a suspected war criminal played by Harris Yulin. The parallel the Holocaust is evident and the story and acting combined with the way controversial and sensitive subjects are handled make this a powerful episode. Other episodes dealt with spiritualism, racial relations, abuses of power, and more allowing the series to take a look at topics in a hard hitting way, and unlike past Treks, events did not have to be wrapped up in an hour and were free to carry over to future episodes and seasons as many did.<br /><br />  To this cast a myriad of strong supporting actors and actresses mixed with a vast and complex storyline allowed for some of the best moments in science Fiction to be created.<br />The Season One DVD set is a well-crafted set that in many ways surpasses the outstanding Next Generation series.

0316666343|5.0|This book touched me right from the beginning. I did not have trouble getting into it, I actually started reading it very late at night and had to force myself to stop so I could start with a clear head the next day.<BR>For anyone who has lost a loved one, this book can allow you to see death in a different light. This is the kind of book that makes you pause and think about things you may not always think about, each character has their own way of touching you. <BR>The only thing I did not like was the ending. I've seen a few reviews stating the same. Just a matter of opinion I guess.
B000089CPF|5.0|There are a few reviews here that do a better job describing the music than I can, but I couldn't help but write a rebuttal to the \\"music fan\\" whose single star rating for this band seems to come solely from his opinion that \\"gringos\\" can't or shouldn't have Hispanic influences in their music.  All I can do is roll my eyes.  If you flip back through your history book, and you only have to flip a few pages, you'll see that with the exception of possibly food, music is the main blending point between cultures.  Sure, sure, the cynics will call it musicians ripping each other off, but in reality, there's a ton of cross pollination that goes on willingly when musicians from different backgrounds meet.  Whose to say what's \\"valid\\" or not?<br />Anyway, if you listen to Calexico I think you can say it's flavored with plenty of south of the border flourishes and instrumentation, but it certainly isn't trying to ape another style.  The singing has this romantic, kind of creepy low key feel.  I was pleased to see (hear) the improvement in the singing.  While I still think that Black Light is the most exciting and exotic of their albums, Feast of Wire is made very accessible by singing that's in tune.  Rather than sounding like inter-scene music for a southwestern themed film, this album has actual songs -- something that should appeal to folks who like such things.  But what do I know, I live over 1000 miles from the (southern) border.
1402511787|3.0|Let me start by apologizing right up front for giving this novel 3 stars. I already know that some of you are going to be upset that I gave this critically acclaimed, award nominated book such a low score. WAIT before you get mad and let me explain. I listened to the book on tape. The audio version. Some 36 hours. But it's not the length of the book that's a problem - longer is usually better actually. It's the intense imagery that was problem. McEwan spent so many words describing the intimate details of everything in this novel. I literally drowned in the descriptions sometimes. If I had been reading the novel, I am sure I would have \\"skimmed\\" places (yes, we all do it, but only some of us can admit it) and hence felt the full impact of the wonderful plot. The three points of narration are masterful. The characters are incredible. If I had read this book. I'd probably have scored it a five. But I didn't. And on audio, even though it is very well read by Jill Tanner, it was too much of a good thing. Like eating a very, very rich dessert... after awhile you have push the plate away because it's too much.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie has a lot more action than the fellowship of the ring, for example the 40 min. battle at the end.All the charecters are good and play their parts perfect and if you thought the fellowship got slow at parts don't worry about this one because this one is only slow about 2 parts for like 2 seconds each.There is not much more I can say about this movie but it's better than the first so see it.
6305922756|1.0|If you're going to make such an excellent documentary, why make it about about a band that nobody has ever heard of?  <br />Getting similar behind-the-scenes footage on the Who, The Stones, or Genesis would have been a monumental achievment in documentary cinema.<br />But Spinal Pap?
B00005JKZT|5.0|This part 2 series is one of the best movie which I have found compared to fellowship of the rings(part 1). The exciting part in this movie is the war between Gandalf(leading a group of fighters)and the orks. The war between the tree wizard and the evil saruman is also very interesting and exciting.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I can't remember enjoying music over and over more than I have enjoyed this CD by Norah Jones.  Her voice is great and the music is perfect from everything to making love to cleaning your house!  Highly recommended to all who love really great music!
0393312836|4.0|In Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, we meet Alex, a nasty 15-year-old hoodlum living in a not-so-distant dystopian future who narrates his story to us in an invented slang called Nadsat (basically a cross between Russian and English). During a botched burglary, Alex accidentaly kills an old woman and is sent to prison to serve a 14-year sentence. A couple of years into said sentence, his jailers offer him a proposition - sign up for this experimental treatment which only lasts for a few weeks, and you're a free man. Alex, of course, does just this, much to his later chagrin - it turns out that this treatment takes the notion of \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" to undreamt-of extremes.<br />The first thing that clues you into the fact that A Clockwork Orange is not your run-of-the-mill popular fiction novel is the Nadsat. It may seem intimidating at first (I know it was intimidating to me, to the extent that I waited several months after I purchased the novel to actually start reading it),  but it actually only takes a chapter or two until you get the hang of it. If you have trouble with it, simply do a search on Google on \\"Nadsat\\" - you'll find at least half a dozen links to Nadsat-to-English glossaries. <br />The other thing that stands out (once you dig in a little bit) is the book's thematic complexity. A Clockwork Orange asks many difficult questions, none of which have easy answers: To what extent are we willing to punish criminals? Why have we always felt the need to dehumanize them? And finally this: if a man no longer has free will, is he truly a man?<br />One to put on the \\"challenging reading\\" shelf, and highly recommended (by me, anyway).
B000002KBA|5.0|My all-time favorite Deep Purple album. This album is a rocker. Speed King, Child in time classic songs. Flight of the Rat, great tune. Living wreck, we've all had mornings like that, especially after drinking. LOL. THis album is truly Heavy metal.
B000084T18|5.0|I don't know what you guys are talking about, this Cd is tight.  Anyone who says different must be a poser because if you really like 50 Cent you would know that this is the best Cd YET.  They are explosive on this Cd.  The tight beats with the fresh lyrics make this a great cd.  Peace
B00005JKJA|3.0|In reality, I really enjoyed Mulholland Drive, the movie.  It is typical David Lynch, thought provoking, beautifully filmed, but somewhat difficult to understand, especially the first time through.  <br />I would have rated the DVD much higher, however, whoever put this DVD together really shortchanged the buyer.  The \\"Special Features\\" are neither features nor are they special.  At a minimum, I expect any DVD worth the price to have scene selection capability.  This release does not even offer that basic facility. The other \\"special features\\" are production notes and the trailer, whoopie.  You might as well buy the VHS version. <br />In addition to scene selection, I would have liked to have had a director's commentary.  It would have been nice to have some insight into the thought processes that went into the filming.<br />In conclusion, Universal really cheaped out on this DVD.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I saw Metropolis for the first time in an architectural history class. The film was about an hour long, and it was so badly deteriorated that it was hard to watch. I could tell that it was an incredible film when it was made, but time had taken it's toll.<br />All I can say about the restoration is WOW! The visuals are incredible, and there is now enough original footage that the story makes sense.<br />For it's history and pioneering visual effects, this is an absolute must-have for any film buff.
0802136834|5.0|Alison Wier does a remarkable job taking us into the life of Henry VIII. The book is well researched and the language is clear for everyone to understand.Mrs Weir presents every wife of Henry VIII clearly and full of details.Also, i was very impressed with how Mrs Weir was able to explain a little bit about the politics of Europe without getting the reader bored with minor details.I was also impressed by the details of everyday court life brought into life by Mrs Wier.Excellent book for everyone!
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley-<BR>wow, cannot say much more than that...<BR>I always thought, upon hearing Jeff's voice, that if ever there were a male 'Judy Garland', then Jeff would be it. His voice sends shivers down my spine, one notable moment during 'Lilac Wine' when he sings 'Isn't that she, why am I so Hazy'...that one moment is the one where I hear Judy! But I remember hearing 'Last Goodbye' many times on the radio and loving it so much...JB's rendition of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah' brings tears to my eyes, every time...<BR>JB, wish you could have been here to sing more...
B00005NTJK|1.0|1) Sorry, a decision not to &quot;schedule&quot; &quot;Living in the Past&quot; in &quot;the remastered catalogue&quot; does NOT &quot;justify&quot; the &quot;inclusion of those tracks from [&quot;Living in the Past&quot;], here&quot; or &quot;in the other remastered CDs&quot;. One crime against art does not justify another. Two wrongs don't make a right.<br />2) Even if it is true (and I'm dubious) that the ordering of the songs we find here was the original &quot;British&quot; ordering, in contradistinction to the U.S. ordering, it is still very reasonable to fault the ordering we find here. The &quot;U.S.&quot; ordering, if U.S. ordering it be, is distinctly superior to this.<br />3) Contrary to what one may hear from the Jethro Tull camp (or hear from those who claim to hear it from the Jethro Tull camp), the &quot;Living in the Past&quot; songs were originally excluded from various Jethro Tull records because they were judged inferior: Jethro Tull didn't suddenly discover anew at each recording session that a vinyl disc can only hold so many songs. They are not so inferior that that they aren't worth owning collected together onto one record, but they are inferior to the original (and TRUE) &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Benefit&quot;, &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, and &quot;A Passion Play&quot;.<br />4) Neither Jethro Tull, nor its record company, nor anyone, is authorized by the Gods of Time to rewrite the past.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|<br />1. Not Gonna Get Us- A really good way to start out the album. 10/10<BR>2. All The Things She Said- The first single keeps the album going for a while. The chorus will stay in your head for awhile but it will be worth having in your head. 10/10<BR>3. Show Me Love- A really beautiful catchy song. 10/10<BR>4. 30 Minutes- A cute, romantic song. 10/10<BR>5. How Soon Is Now- Also really good! 10/10<BR>6. Clowns (Can You See Me Now?)- Fast and catchy. 10/10<BR>7. Malchik Gay- I thought this would be a song about a gay guy named Malchik, but it is a Russian saying that I have yet to decifer as of yet. 10/10<BR>8. Stars- Half of the song is in English and the rest of the song is in Russian, if the lyrics would have been translated into English it would have been better. 9/10<BR>9. Ya Shosla S Uma- The Russian version of \\"All The Things She Said\\" sounds much better here! 10/10<BR>10. Nas Ne Dagoniat- The Russian version of \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" as always sounds much better this way! 10/10<BR>11. Show Me Love (Extended Version)- the only low point of the album, doesn't really add much, I wish they would have put something better as the last song, but only affects the CD a little. 6.5/10<br />As you can see the album pretty much has really good songs on it, and not many bad ones. The overall grade of the album is:<BR>106.5/110 points which on my scale averages the CD at about an A-Still enough to warrant a 5 star on Amazon.com standards. Anyway, thank you for reading my review. Pick up this great CD now!
B00003CXTG|2.0|It's funny--I remember reading an interview with Michael Bay, part of a little press junket for the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\", a movie that I had waited eagerly to see since viewing the trailers some months before. In the interview he overtly admitted that James Cameron was one of his biggest influences as a filmmaker. So it is not very surprising to discover that this movie more or less follows the formula presented in the much better \\"Titanic\\".<br />In the movie, two Army pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) fight for the affections of a nurse (Kate Beckinsale), and to complicate matters, the Japanese attacks Pearl Harbor. Bummer.<br />The movie is filled with flaws: <BR>1. The trailers for the movie gave the illusion that the movie would be \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" with better special effects. It was not, and only after watching the movie would one be aware of it. I liked \\"Titanic\\", but then again, with that movie I KNEW what I was getting into.<br />2. Love triangles are cliche, and a movie like this one could probably get away with it; however the filmmakers chose instead to foolishly make all three corners of the triangle likable. Such a spin should be reserved for a more artsy movie that is trying to make you think.<br />3. The tragedy of the air raid at Pearl Harbor is trivialized by using it as a means to further a love story as opposed to presenting it as the catalyst to America's involvment in WWII. At times this is disappointing, at other times, appalling.<BR>I'm trying to ignore historical inaccuracies but I can't help it--hey, I didn't know they had Spruance-class destroyers in 1941! Also, there's no such place as downtown London. I always thought there was a Central London. Shows what I know.<br />4. The movie, which would have ended on a stronger note by concluding with the air raid, drags on into a perfunctory depiction of Col. Doolittle's raid on Tokyo--a scene which did not have the intended impact. It also lacked the visual flourish and detail of the 30+minute-long air raid sequence.  It is in the movie for no other reason than to knock a corner out of the love traingle.<br />5.  Finally, the gore of the movie is sort of out of place.  Since this was a PG-13 movie that was angled at teenyboppers (and yes, Michael Bay, it would have been nice if I knew that!!), the effects of being shot/blown up are toned down to a 1950's filmmaking sort of level.  We see Japanese planes strafe helpless sailors trying desperately to hold on to their ships and defend themselves, and when they get shot, the bullets don't punch huge holes in them and send blood flying everywhere, but instead leave a clean, fun-looking hole; the sailor clutches shot part of body, screams and falls over.  When someone is too close to an explosion, the body is not torn apart by the concussion but merely lifted into the air and placed elsewhere.  I half-expected some of the sailors to immediately get up after being thrown by an explosion, brush himself off and say to the camera, \\"That one was a doozy!\\" before rejoining the battle or getting a fun-looking hole punched in him.<br />So if we follow the movie's logic, the hospital scene would be impossible because there was no bloodshed in the battle scene, at least, not the kind that warrants the need to dump spare blood into Coke bottles.<br />Now, the DVD extras on this movie are something of an oddity--they're fantastic. <BR>A documentary of the Pearl Harbor raid is included. It's almost like the filmmakers knew the movie lacked a lot of historical context (the motive for attacking Pearl Harbor, we are told in the movie, was something so simple it could be surmised in a single line of dialogue) and threw these in to supplement the lack of historical information in the movie. <br />The \\"making of\\" featurettes are good, as you would imagine, but the unintentionally reveal a paradoxical fanatacism on the part of the special-effects house to \\"get the facts down\\" by looking at photographs taken of the raid inprogress, which is bizzarre, given the historical gaffes in the movie's script.<br />This movie is a definite \\"take it or leave it\\". The movie is ostensibly for teenagers; history buffs will no doubt hate it, as will military movie fans (not all of which are history buffs). Those people would benefit more from watching \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" and looking for a Pearl Harbor documentary, sold separately.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This is such a great movie. But I do have to say that I liked the first installment in the Harry Potter series better. I think it was better made and represented the book more. BUT, I agree that you cannot compare the book and the movie. The books are just so spectacular! I wish I had more time and less homework (if any of my teachers are reading, look at that last comment!) I would definitely read all four of the books over again. I will definitely read the 5th one as soon as it comes out. Now, the movies cannot be criticized for not following the books exactly or for leaving parts out, because how can you fit all those details into a movie? Do you want to be sitting there for 5 hours watching the movie? NO!!! Well, at least I don't. Nonetheless, this movie is still worth checking out, as it is a very nice representation of the books (without comparing them) and are a great experience of the book (again no comparing) without having to read it again. I would still recommend reading the book first because the books are so exciting that all the movie does is give away the ending and all the exciting parts! I do think that the special effects are better in this one than the first one, but I still liked the first one better. Maybe it's just cuz I'm scared of spiders, but anyway, I recommend checking it out, also. I give this movie 8/10 for book representation, 10/10 for special effects, 9/10 for plot (it's a bit scary) and 9/10 for overall effect. I really recommend this DVD to anyone! ENJOY!!!!!
0440234743|5.0|I remember I was 13 when i read it last year. I started reading it and thought it was gonna be a boring book, as i got going i couldnt put the book down, the mystery, the wondering its a great book for anyone to read you'll love it.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! Norah Jones is a breath of fresh air amidst all these image-conscious singers. Norah isn't about image at all, she's just about her music. And she also doesn't have to sing the hell out of her songs to prove that she's extremely talented as a singer and a musician. Her mellow, soothing, and relaxing music takes me to another place. But I can't totally relax, b/c I'm so into the depth of the emotion-laden lyrics. She deserved to win all those Grammys. She's a top-notch artist, and I can't wait to see what she puts out next!
B00005JK8K|3.0|For all the expectations and hoopla surrounding this film, I was never quite sure what the point was. As a war film, it's the usual Hollywood shoot-em-up-bang-bang extravaganza, with meatball waving Japanese soldiers and digital aircraft making precision bombing runs that even modern JDAM weaponry would be pressed to beat. As a story about the Navajo \\"windtalkers,\\" it starts off decently and then sidetracks into an exploration of racial bigotry - not an unworthy subject, but it just hangs there. <br />Cage is Cage, proficient acting - but the character \\"Joe\\" could have been played by almost anyone - no serious dialogue. The story explored in the most depth, unfortunately, is Joe's - silently weighing whether to treat his \\"Windtalker\\" as a fellow human being, let alone a fellow Marine, or whether to treat him as a military commodity that must be kept away from the Japanese at all costs. Woo and Cage work their way through the usual Hollywood themes as the film meanders along.<br />All in all, not the best Woo film I've seen, and \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is much closer to real combat life. But, an entirely acceptable film, if you look at it as just entertainment - offers no special insight into the Navajo code effort, the military or the WW II in the pacific.
B0000072KY|5.0|this is my favorite nirvana album.  in my opinion, it buries, nevermind.  if you stop and think about it, all in utero is the indie version of nevermind.  there are some great songs here such as heart shaped box, rape me, milk it, scentless apprentice, pennyroyal tea, tourette's, radio friendly unit shifter and all apologies.  <BR>     this album is produced by chicago's steve albini which gives it a abrasive and harsh sound unlike the slick nevermnd.  kurdt said this sound was very natural to him.  i think the band itself, by this time, had been around long enough and had their \\"shtick\\" down so the music is tight and the dynamics are on the money.  i saw them live and they were just as tight and awesome as on album.  they had a certain something, a magic that made them special.  this album is amazing.  <BR>     with nevermind, i loved the fact that ten minutes later, they come back with the noise jam.  in fact, i have something i want you people to do.  anytime you see nevermind in a jukebox, play track #12 (something in the way)<BR>   i do it for kurdt.  after the song ends, the cd continues to play but no one realizes and then BAM!!!  the cd explodes with the noise jam.  <BR>     i loved it so much, i did research and found that in utero had a similiar trick but this time he has a song called <BR>\\"gallons of rubbing alcohol flowing thru the strip which is part spoken word, part noise jam.  violitle and schizophrenic, melodic and quiet with explosive drums and spoken words for lyrics.  its an amazing trip
B000088E6D|5.0|This cd is absolutely wonderful.  I only recently received it and I have spent hours lost in the voice of Michael Buble.  This cd is a definite must have for any lover of music.
B00006V9A0|3.0|if you were alive and kicking and screaming in the early nineties than you probably have most of the songs on this cd.  it is a well produced cd And YKYR is one awesome song(yes i bought this for YKYR alone) but if you already own nevermind, in utero, bleach, and/or the unplugged, then you have this cd.  i find the songs are great but if you want to get into nirvana then this is a fine begginning,(although i say buy the actual albums starting at bleach)<BR>     i think we can sum up a review of this album in two sentences.  if you own a handful of nirvana albums then skip this (unless you want YKYR).  if your just starting a nirvana collection, then this is a well worthwhile purchase.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Give me Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones or even David Lee Roth over this, it has no appeal, it is mindless noise, how the hell can you call this rock, Cornell drones as annoyingly as Kurt Cobain, this band is trying to emulate a time that left long ago in the 70s and 80s, and isn't coming back unless the true rock legends wake up and blow these fools off the stage, they are no better than Korn, Slipknot or even Rage themselves... check your ears this album [smells], there is no true element of rock and roll in it, its BORING, i thought rock and roll was a mirror of the times, we must have pretty...boring times to produce this!!! BRING BACK THE REAL ROCK!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!
B0000035E7|4.0|... so this is nirvana's first album.  most people dont own it and should.  with standouts like the beatlesque aboout a girl and the dynamic negative creep this album is great.  one stroke of genius is the song school where cobain sings the same word somewhere between ten or fifteen times but you never notice because of the different ways he sings/screams it.  <BR>     the music is gritty, part melody, part noise and somehow always good.  kurdt had a knack for taking pop-like melodies and combining them with his altenative/punk side and making really different songs.  i felt he was a true artist and bleach is a begginning.  there is room for improvement but for a first album ...it is a a fine piece of work.  from the punk rock political song of downer to my favorite in floyd the barber, bleach is one album that rocks
B000002KAT|5.0|a lot of people think this album is [bad]. and i can understand that. i'll never think i'll like bands like the clash or nirvana or any other critically acclaimed band to a great extent just because i don't really feel it. just as some of the people who don't like this album because they aren't feeling it. so this albums not for everybody. but if you're anything like me you'll thoroughly enjoy astral weeks. i remember when i first heard about how good it was, i download a few songs off the internet. the only one i remember getting was madame george. and i thought it was ok . had a different sound but it didn't do much for me. some time later i found the cd for real cheap so i bought it. and when i put on the first song \\"astral weeks\\", the title track, i was literally blown away. it gave me that feeling inside that you get when you hear that special music that you really connect to. it was like an orgasm hearing that one part \\"could you find me, would you kiss a my eyes, lay me down, in silence easy....to be born again\\" i've listened to this album probably 50 or more times since then and i still love it. it doesn't seem like an album i'll ever get tired of. i love all the tracks but the weakest i think is \\"the way young lovers do\\". which is the track coincidently  most people you don't really like the album think is the best song. so go buy this album either way, just because if you are one of those you like it, it's well worth it.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|ok, this gimmic of theirs is clever because they're both pretty damn cute, but aren't very talented in the singing area. one of my friends bought this CD several days ago and i thought i was going to insane because of how they sounds. in \\"not gonna get us\\" they sound like a couple of off-key chipmunks. some of the lines in \\"all the things she said\\" just plain don't make any sense. <br />maybe i'm one of the few who can see right through this gimmic for what it really is....an attempt to sell [bad] records with hot girls who claim to be \\"in love with eachother.\\"
B000001DTM|5.0|I have a very tough time saying which is my favorite U2 album, as at any given moment I could pick any of four (this one, Joshua Tree, All You Can't Leave Behind, and Unforgettable Fire), with Zooropa and War tied at a very, very close fifth. But you know, it doesn't matter. This is an incredible album.<br />U2 developed the sound they're known for somewhere around or just after War -- Bono's often-raw vocals, Edge's echoey guitar, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen's pounding rhythm tracks. They created not one but two epic albums during the 80s, and even where they didn't quite measure up (as on Rattle and Hum) they still managed to show a stunning creativity and awareness of their roots. And then Achtung Baby hit like a small nuclear blast.<br />The grinding guitar (remniscent of the beginning of \\"Purple Haze\\") that opens \\"Zoo Station\\", the first track of the album, sets the tone for an album that is all about intensity, emotional roller coasters, and above all, RAWK. The emotional stress that nearly tore the group apart during the album's production comes screaming through in the results, from the dizzying anticipation of \\"Mysterious Ways\\" to the gut-wrenching agony of \\"One\\" to the danciness of \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\". It's an amazing listen, never falls flat.<br />And yes, it's an excellent album to work out to -- a gym I used to go to played it all the way through once, and it managed to provide just about the right tempo.
B000088E6D|5.0|Rich, rewarding - absolutely wonderful! The arrangements compliment Michael's beautiful and rich voice --- a perfect match and a must have disc... Without doubt, the calibre of this album sets a new standard - and for that I say THANK YOU!!! <BR>I only wish I could give it 10 stars!!!
0345347951|5.0|They came, in huge ships the size of cities.  The Overlords came with power and a mission.  A mission that was unknown to mankind, but mankind had little they could do about it.  The aliens stopped war, ended want and even brought an end to animal abuse!  They were all-powerful, all-knowing and staggeringly brilliant.  Yet, EVEN they answered to an even greater power.<br />By the end of this book, mankind goes beyond the Earth and the reader even feels a little pity for the Overlords themselves.
B000069HKH|5.0|It helps if you are a long time Springsteen and E Street band fan and can reach back to the Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town era. This song involkes memories of the tremendous sound Springsteen put out in that era and the poetry of words that his pre Born in the USA work envolked. <br />All of the songs have a September 11 theme, touching and materfully written.  Like poetry set to music.  One of the most prototypical E Street bands songs in Further Up the Road, which gets stuck in your head for days if you are not careful.  The drum beat from Max Weinberg is incredible on this. <br />The CD gives the E Street band to show off their tremendous talents set to the lyrics of redemption and hope that came from Springsteen's heart. <br />I think Born to Run is the greatest rock album ever made but The Rising would be right there behind it.  In the same category as Darkness on the Edge of Town or the River. <br />Don McNay...
B000067CPX|5.0|Over the past 30 or so years that I have been listening to rock, I have always found that the best, most lasting discs are the ones that take time to grow on me. This is one of &quot;those!&quot; The Peppers really reach a wide range of sounds on this disc. By the Way has one great song after another. I find myself listening to what I think is the best song on the disc only to find another I like even more. The song writing is strong and more mature than past discs and the sound is still fresh and new. A strong follow up to Californication.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|On the spur of the moment I rented The Time Machine the other night. I had heard mixed reviews but I'm a sci-fi fan and a H. G. Wells nut so I thought what the heck. I was extremely surprised how much I enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect but it had so many things to like that I would most sincerely recommend it.<br />Probably the weakest aspect of this movie is the plot. It's not bad but average at best. It follows the book relatively so, although they made the time traveler's purpose much more compelling. We're taken step-by-step through his tragedies to his travels into the past and future. The movie doesn't really hit it's stride until about the half-way mark when we're introduced to the Eloi, a race of humans 800,000 years in the future. The pace begins to build to a exiting but predictable climax.<br />What makes this movie a must see is the way it was put together. The cast is first rate. Guy Pierce plays a lost but dedicated scientist wonderfully well. Samantha Mumba deserves credit for her performance, considering this was her first major picture role. Jeremy Irons is just excellent in a limited role as the ultimate \\"villian.\\" His portrayal of the uber-Morlock could have been just a straight forward \\"I'm-evil-and-you're-not\\" villian but instead we're treated to a very complex character. Both likable and detestable. Orlando Jones plays a computer-generated figure who somehow has survived all the years, first meeting the traveler in the year 2030, then again after 800,000 years. Although the concept is a little weak Jones' characher is necessary to bring the good Dr. (and us) up to date. It was an neat addition.<br />The very best part of this was the music. The Klaus Badelt score was awesome at the very least. He has the talent to capture the mood without overpowering the scene. His soundtrack coupled with Simon Wells beautiful vison makes for a great experience. Also the very last scene showing characters in two different times showed real imagination.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who goes to the theater to escape. As long as you try not to out-think yourselves you will enjoy it.uld recommend this movie to anyone who goes to the theater to escape.

0783240287|5.0|This DVD is adored by everyone in our house.  My 8 and 4 year-old girls sit through the whole thing, totally entranced and my 2 year-old son gets through 20+ minutes (a minor miracle).  For myself, the songs are very catchy and each is a different genre.  I enjoyed seeing the celebrities like Sir Richard Attenborough and Joan Rivers but the 11 brothers really steal the show.  Donny Osmond has an incredible voice and really shines in this adaptation of the biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors.  Its a great addition to any DVD collection.
B00006690G|5.0|I think Eminem's new CD has some of the best lyrics ever in a CD. While its more mild than his last CD, the words still pack a punch. In another review, a guy mentioned that he didnt like the song \\"til i collapse\\" beacuse it had too simple of a beat. While the beat is simple, the song isnt about the beat. It is about the straight up rap. My favorite track has to be \\"say what you say\\" ft. dr. dre. The only song I've ever heard with a better single dis on an artist is Nas's \\"either\\" where every single dis is a classic. You can't beat Dre dissing Jermaine Dupri. \\"Over 80 million records sold, and i aint have to do it with ten or eleven year olds\\" As for the rest of the CD i think every song is a gem cept \\"my dad's gone crazy\\" Hailie Jane saing, i think my dad's gone crazy, is the single most annoying thing i've ever heard.
0380729407|3.0|I hate to say it...but Bradbury's writing style on this book was not for me.  There were passages I skipped and I felt that the ending was way too rushed.  I would have loved to learn more about the Illustrated Man and his crew - how did they get their powers?  Where did they come from?  The best part of novel was the library scene...otherwise, it was just OK for me.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|There are movies where you notice the soundtrack, and others where you don't. The latter is usually considered ideal, and yet it's impossible to ignore Philip Glass's pervasive, all-encompassing soundtrack while watching Stephen Daldy's celebrated follow-up to \\"Billy Elliot\\" (the same could just as easily be said of Elmer Bernstein's majestic score for \\"Far From Heaven\\"). This isn't such a bad thing--far from it.<br /><br />The piano-dominated score, incorporating motifs from \\"Satyagraha,\\" \\"Glassworks,\\" and \\"Solo Piano\\" is, by turns, lush, sumptuous, and stirring. Nick Ingman conducts, Michael Riesman plays the piano, and the Lyric Quartet provides the strings. The fruits of their artistry add depth to the action without ever quite overwhelming it.<br /><br />Based on Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, and inspired by Virginia Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" the storyline compels enough that it doesn't really \\"need\\" music to make an impact. And the actors--Nicole Kidman (Woolf), Julianne Moore (Laura Brown), and Meryl Streep (Clarissa Vaughn)--breathe such life into these distinct characters, living in different time periods, that they don't need it either.<br /><br />But it's always there, like a ghostly presence in each woman's life, helping to tie their divergent storylines together as much as the themes that are common to each. In the end, the score is as much a unifying force as Peter Boyle's deft editing and Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", which was originally to be called...\\"The Hours.\\" The CD booklet includes liner notes by Cunningham (focusing on his admiration for Glass), excerpts about each character from his novel, and film stills.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips really treat the listener to a sonic wonderland with this release.  It rewards repeated listening, and alternates between great humor and pathos, simplicity and profundity.  The electronic sounds and sampling add and never detract from the basic band unit.  The music is perfectly crafted and suited for Wayne Coyne's distinctive singing voice. Overall, YOSHIMI is one of the best releases of 2002, and one of the best alternative music releases of the past decade.
B000002H72|5.0|So many of today's acts always seem to cite The Pixies as a major influence, and justly so. I always find that it is either \\"Come On Pilgrim\\" or this record that gets the most nods. From Pavement to U2, from The Hives to OK GO, artists sing Pixies praise a-plenty. You should find out why everyone should own at least one or two Pixies' records.<br />I picked to review this particular release because it is not only one of the high water marks for the band, (there are plenty) it is a good place to start if you are unfamilar with them.<br />\\"Doolittle\\" really sets the bar quite high for what was going on outside of the grunge grumblings of the late eighties/early nineties. They have a style all there own (now often nicked), but it's never as good as the original blueprint. Songs like \\"Debaser\\" carry enough alt-punk angst to get street cred in any city. The main difference is the intelligence of the lyrics and the ever changing dynamic from song to song. Yes, their one sudo-hit is on here (Here Comes Your Man), and \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven\\" is a great single too. It might be the worst tune on the whole disc though. I prefer the quiet power of something like\\" Tame\\", it's beautiful and just as powerful as anything ever written. The more up-tempo version of \\"Wave of Mutilation\\" (not the one in Fight Club) rings as true  as the more popular version from the film world. And \\"Crackity Jones\\" echoes back to the earlier \\"Surfer Rosa\\", with it's start stop, high energy and whacked out vocals stylings. I really can't find any fault with this album. Tough and pretty, and cold and warm at the same, \\"Doolittle\\" carved a very influential niche in the alt-rock landscape of today.
0385503954|4.0|This novel's impact is in its ending, which is a thought-provoking spin on the idea of 'Atonement'.  <br />Briony, the imaginative youngest child of the family, is an avid writer of childish plays and melodramatic stories.  She witnesses an ordinary event - an exchange between her sister Cecilia and a family friend, Robbie, by the fountain.  From this, Briony cultivates the seed of her imagination that will culminate in a tragedy that changes the lives of everyone she loves (Do I sound like the book jacket?  That's because that was a fantastic summary anyway. You don't need any more than that).  <br />The beauty of this book is the irony of Briony's 'atonement', which the reader will see is an act directed at relieving her conscience rather than to make up for what she has done.  She uses the very tool (her imagination) that caused all this heartache to atone for her sins but by this very act, diminishes and denies the true impact of her transgression.  McEwan separates this book into primarily four sections, making leaps of several years in between to show that sorrow can persist and ferment with great tragedy, consequences linger for a lifetime, and sometimes, foolishness lasts beyond childhood and into old age.  <br />Several people will have different opinions of Briony, I'm sure, which is why this book is a great read because it sparks divided views about how McEwan wanted to portray this complex and hopelessly flawed character. The ending will generate a maze of thoughts about what it is to 'atone', whether Briony accomplishes this, and how do people live with their mistakes and tragedies?  On the other hand, the book is slow in some sections, encompassing depressing passages on war.  It is however, a rewarding journey for the reader.

I have watched the anthology every year since it's original release. You will not be disappointed.
0151008116|5.0|As I was born in Canada, grew up in NYC, and am of Indian descent, I could identify with much of this book.  No, I have never been shipwrecked with a Royal Bengal Tiger! In simple terms, I suppose Martel is trying to say what many people believe:  there is no way to absolutely know if God(s) exist(s), but life is much more liveable if we believe He(they) does(do).  I enjoyed Pi's discovery of Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism.  Again, keeping things simple, there are aspects of each we can all incorporate in our lives (a la Rodney King).  It is perhaps a stretch to say that Pi and Richard Parker represent not two different species, but two people from different religions:  if a boy and a ferocious tiger can coexist harmoniously on a lifeboat for months, why do humans have such difficulty coexisting with other humans with different religious beliefs?

0060523794|5.0|At the outset, it is important to understand that this volume is not an autobiography; rather, in response to apparently substantial curiosity, Gerstner offers his explanation of how he and his associates achieved what he calls \\"IBM's historic turnaround.\\" In process, he also explains how and why he became CEO, what his initial assumptions about the company were, to what extent they proved wrong (and why), and finally, what he had learned by the time he resigned as CEO after guiding IBM from April 1993 until March 2002. Having carefully observed Gerstner during the infrequent interviews to which he reluctantly agreed, the book seems to have been written by him without assistance except stenographic. The style and tone as well as the observations are clearly his. This is important. More often than not, a book bearing the name of a CEO as its author has been rigorously edited and thoroughly sanitized by one or more \\"manuscript doctors\\" before publication. Not so with this one.<br />Its title was perhaps suggested by that of a book written by Rosabeth Moss Kanter (When Giants Learn to Dance, 1989) and implies that it may be unlikely but is nonetheless possible for an organization as large and as cumbersome as IBM once was to become \\"quick on its feet\\" again. Soon after becoming CEO, Gerstner realized that IBM's culture -- not its core strategies -- prevented it from being able to \\"dance.\\" As Gerstner observes, \\"[IBM's] decades-long run of uninterrupted success ties in with the other closely related, and vitally important, aspect of IBM's recent history. This is about its corporate culture -- specifically, the kind of culture that arises in an environment without intense competitive pressure or threats.\\" By the time Gerstner had become CEO, the company and its people had lost touch with external realities. It was widely believed that what was happening in the marketplace was essentially irrelevant to the success of the company. \\"IBM's dominant position had created a self-contained, self-sustaining world for the company. IBM had ridden one horse, and ridden it well. But that horse could carry it only so far before it broke down.<br />This was the corporate culture which Gerstner encountered as he assumed his duties, a culture the product of two predominant forces: the runaway success of the System/360, and, the impact of the antitrust suit filed against IBM by the United States Department of Justice on January 31, 1969, the final day of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. \\"For thirteen years IBM lived under the specter of a federally mandated breakup.\\"<br />It would be a mistake to assume that most of the credit for what was accomplished at IBM during Gerstner's tenure as CEO should be given to him. He dedicated this book to \\"the thousands of IBMers who never gave up on their company, their colleagues, and themselves. They are the real heroes of the reinvention of IBM.\\" This book explains how that was accomplished, a transformation whose objective was to re-establish \\"the high-performance cultured that animated IBM under both Watsons.\\"<br />Having relinquished his duties as CEO to Sam Palmisano, Gerstner suggests that his successor has an opportunity to make connections to IBM's past which Gerstner had not. \\"His challenge will be to make them without going backward; to know that the centrifugal forces that drove IBm to be inward-looking and self-absorbed still lie powerful in the company. Continuing to drive change while building on the best (and [in italics] only the best) of the past is the ultimate description of the job of Chief Executive Officer, International Business Machines Corporation.\\" It is probably too early to take full measure of Gerstner's performance in that position. However, now having his own account of those critically important years in IBM's history, we can at least appreciate the nature and extent of what he and his associates experienced...and what together they eventually accomplished.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Kevin Maney's The Maverick and the Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM as well as Thomas Watson, Jr. and Peter Petre's Father, Son & Co: My Life at IBM and Beyond.share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Kevin Maney's The Maverick and the Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM as well as Thomas Watson, Jr. and Peter Petre's Father, Son & Co: My Life at IBM and Beyond.

B00006IUL7|4.0|In between the Godfathers I&II, Francis Ford Coppola came out with a wonderful movie called \\"The Conversation\\". Though not as groundbreaking as either Godfather film, \\"The Conversation\\", in my mind, was one of the better movies from the 70's. I feel the same way about \\"Insomnia\\". Though not as revolutionary as \\"Memento\\", it is still a fine film in its own right and should not be compared to it. I mention this because a lot of people seem to unfairly criticize it as well as director Christopher Nolan because it's not \\"Memento II\\".<br />By revealing early on in the film who the bad guy is, \\"Insomnia\\" adds a nice twist to the suspense genre. The suspense is held up by the protagonist's inner conflict of right and wrong. As you probably know, Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective Will Dormer who is brought Alaska to investigate a murder. It's also a chance for Dormer to escape some professional problems he is dealing with back home. Accompanying Dormer is Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), his partner from L.A. who can potentially make things worse for Dormer back home. Through a sequence of events, the problems that face Dormer back home are minimized, but not without consequences. The murderer in Alaska now has something on Dormer and wants to negotiate. What will Dormer do? These pressures coupled with Alaska's white nights keep Dormer up at night. The whole thing induces quite a bit of tension. Al Pacino is his usual amazing self. Definitely a satisfying suspense flick.
B000002H97|4.0|I've been arguing with several of my friends who think this is the best Metallica album. They are quite mistaken, as most of you know. That honor most definetly goes to Master of Puppets, one of the greatest albums EVER. To say that this one is better is sacrilegious. Is this album bad? No. Is it great? Not really. I used to love it to death because i didn't know any better, but now i listen to better music (Dream Theater :P) and have realized how talented musicians can get.. and now i know that MOP was there pinnacle.<br />That's because Metallica changes so much on this album.  The songs are much slower, Hetfield's voice is different, Ulrich's drums are far too loud. Newsted just does what he does, and Hammett's solos aren't what they used to be. They just aren't. <br />Take the power ballads from Master of Puppets (Sanatarium), Ride the Lightning (Fade to Black), ...And Justice for All (One) and The Black Album (Unforgiven). Unforgiven is a decent song, but nowhere closes to the aforementioned masterpieces. This is an accessible, slower, calmer, more mainstream album. I know a girl and she doesn't like any hard Metallica but she says \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is her favorite song. That's how much they've changed.. she doesn't even like their defining sound but she likes a song from this album because it's quiet and PRETTY. So this album is good for Metallica newbies and some girls. Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning are still the best, check them out, metalheads.
B000002J1O|5.0|This CD continues the farytale theme of NURSERY CRYME and betters it.  We start on our journey with &quot;Dancing With The Moonlit Knight&quot; which contains the CD's title.  &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; is the story of a slow-pated lawnmower man who gets unneeded (and unheeded) advice.  &quot;Firth Of Fifth&quot; is the CD's most beautiful track.  Check out that chord progression in Steve Hackett's solo!  &quot;More Fool Me&quot; features Phil Collins' plaintive voice.  &quot;The Battle Of Epping Forest&quot; tells of a gangland turf fight.  &quot;Afer The Ordeal&quot; can be said to have served as the previous piece's postlude.  This is an instrumental piece.  &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; is a tune about dating.  It bleeds into the CD's epilogue &quot;Aisle Of Plenty&quot;, a comical song about supermarkets.  It features the same chord progression found on track 1.  SELLING ENGLAND is definitely the best of Genesis' early work.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I love John Mayer! His music is really sensual and sweet. A lot of people compare him to Dave Matthews and there is a simmilarity in style, but they are both amazing on their own. I am frustrated that he is never on the radio or anything, well not the stations I listen to. He goes back to the roots of music where you write and play and preform your own songs, but he doesnt go crazy like a lot of other pop artists. He has the smoothness of country with the catchiness of pop. If you like DMB or country music I reccomend this. It's the best.
B000002J1L|5.0|Speaking as a musician, I have always striven to find what has been lost in the commercially-driven music of today (art) and bring it to light once again.  Such art exists in this, Genesis' third CD (and the first with Phil Collins and Steve Hackett).  &quot;The Musical Box&quot; tells of the outcome of a bizarre croquet game.  &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; is about two who pray for those they love--and have lost.  &quot;The Return Of The Giant Hogweed&quot; is a supercharged number about menacing plants.  &quot;Seven Stones&quot; is a tender ballad about an old man who leaves his life to chance.  &quot;Harold The Barrel&quot; is a comical song about a restaraunt owner who flees his home after cutting off his toes and serving them for tea.  &quot;Harlequin&quot; is the odd duck here.  The CD closes with &quot;The Fountain Of Salmacis&quot;, which has an infectious bass and drum groove, the best since The Crusaders' &quot;A Message From The Inner City&quot;.  NURSERY CRYME should appeal to fans of prog rock, and lovers of good tales.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|Fleetwood Mac has far too many songs that deserve to be placed on a compilation then 2 CD's can handle. I have the 4 CD set they released and even that missed afew key songs (including Seven Wonders, how did that happen when you have over 90 songs?). After the 2003 CD is released and the radio play on that CD is done and the truely great songs are clear I believe it is time for a new Box set to be released with songs from the early days when Fleetwood Mac was a blues band and through to the recent stuff from &quot;The Dance&quot; and the new CD to be released in April. I can name a huge number of songs that this compilation has missed even from the Nicks/Buckingham period and on that deserve their place on a compilation. &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;, &quot;My Little Demon&quot;, &quot;You and I&quot;, &quot;Not That Funny&quot;, and alot more.<br />It is time for a 8 CD compilation covering the entire span of Fleetwood Mac's existence and covers all the songs of note. If possible it would be great to even get notible solo endevours of the members as most of them had some hits outside of Fleetwood Mac that are related to the band in various ways still.<br />This CD I gave 4 stars since it is a decent collection for the casual listener. Even though these people will enjoy the CD though they will not relise all the great music that they are missing. 2 CD's just does not cut it for this band, it hardly scratches the surface.

B00008BLB8|5.0|Caught in the act is basically a Greatest hits Live CD, that features GFR (Mark Farner, Don Brewer, Mel Schacher and Craig Frost) at there hard rock peak in 1975. This may very well be GFR best live album. The CD is 24 Bit digitally remasterred, has excellent liner notes and great artwork. David Tedds and his staff did a wonderful Job restoring the concert to its rightful form. No longer is half of Don Brewer's Drum solo cut out, and no longer is there a fade out in I'm Your Captain. This CD rocks and it is a must have for every GFR fan and would be a great first CD if you want to try GFR out, and take a ride on this Railroad.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|First of all I love the Moulin Rouge DVD. After seeing it I had to get the soundtrack and was not dissapointed, although some of the songs are a bit of a dissapointment. Nature Boy, Because We Can,and Rythm of the Night are not some of the best songs on this album, and frankly, in my opinion they should be left out. Ewan McGregor has an awesome voice which is at its strongest in Your Song, and is great in all of the others. Nicole Kidman for the most part does a pretty good job although I prefere the movie version of One Day I'll Fly Away to this one. The two best songs on the album by far are Complainte de la Butte (mostly in french) and El Tango de Roxanne both add a mixture to this CD. Complainte de la Butte is more of a laid back song, but still beautiful, whereas El Tango de Roxanne is an awesome dance mix with different rythms mixed throughout.
B00005JL78|5.0|This is now one of my most favorite movies. I think this is one of Spielberg's best. It's not focused on action, science fiction, or drama. It is a freaky look into the future that has many twists and interesting dialogue. This movie will, or should, make you think. If you like movies that you can't guess what will happen next and where the main character is not perfect; all with an awesome sci-fi twist, than you will love Minority Report.
0792157869|5.0|The third and more than likely the best of the Indiana Jones sage brings the archaeologist fighter hero full circle from the Palaces of the tropical jungles of India, back to the now Nazi controlled Germany and the deserts of the Middle East and is a return to the atmosphere of \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\" but with a slightly more Apocalyptic feel. Sallah and Marcus Brody are also back after their absence from \\"The Temple of Doom\\". The adventure begins with a large Nazi band lead by the villain leader Walter Donovan captures Marcus Brody and is on a quest to find The Holy Grail in hope of gaining eternal life and immortality.<br />This movie is probably the best of the three movies, although I might say that about \\"The Temple Of Doom\\" as I sometimes feel that it's a toss-up between these two movies in my opinion but I cannot deny that \\"The Last Crusade\\" has the most substance and the most fun of all of the three IJ movies while \\"Temple Of Doom\\" suffers a little bit from it's negative portrayal of India and it's people and I feel for these reasons, The Last Crusade is the better one in my opinion and easily the best of the three Indiana Jones movies and is Spielberg's crowning achievement in his entire directing career.<br />Indiana Jones finds himself reuniting with his father Henry Jones Sr. (played by Sean Connery), and Henry Sr. vanished during his quest for finding the Holy Grail. At first when asked by Walter Donovan and Elsa Schneider to help acquire the cup of Jesus Indiana refuses, but he then reluctantly agrees when he finds out that the archaeologist who was missing was actually his father Henry Jones Sr, who he hadn't spoken to much in 20 years.  Donovan is the leader of a Nazi band who is after the Cup of Jesus to use for their evil purpose of attaining the gift of eternal life. Indiana's longtime friend Marcus Brody is kidnapped by Nazi crusaders. Indy realizes that the Nazi's are planning to use the Grail to become immortal and Indy must stop them from gaining ahold on them but then, the Nazi soldiers who are after it have no idea of the Grails power and the possible consequences.<br />The father-son relationship in this movie is probably the best father-son relationship that I've ever seen in any movie. Both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery steal the show with their roles. No other movie in my opinion shows such a great father-son relationship. There are a lot of funny lines in the movie especially with some occasional arguments between Indy and his dad and it's especially funny with Indy expressing his resentment of being called \\"Junior\\". I just wonder whatever happened with Indy's mother. Did she die or simply leave the family a long time ago? That's the only thing I think that was missing but oh well. Sean Connery does such a wonderful job in bringing out the character in Henry Jones Sr. Henry Jones Sr. and his son Indiana Jones make the best father-son action duo in any movie that I've ever seen and it shows that one is never too old to be a hero.<br />I must say that Elsa was a great and charismatic character. I definitely prefer the evilness of her over the annoying cowardice of Willie from \\"The Temple of Doom\\" any day. Elsa, despite being evil, she shows a lot more strength, courage, and wisdom than Willie did which I thought was hard to detect in her. I would much rather see Indy face-off against a villain hottie than fall in love with a helpless damsel (Evil tone of voice comes in).  The odd 'ally yet enemy at the same time' relationship between Indy and Elsa is great. Allison Doody did such a great job playing Elsa. I think that Elsa is almost as good as Marion Ravenwood from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and far better than the helpless Willie Scott from \\"Temple Of Doom\\". I'd rather see angry female villains or rebellious female characters any day over helpless damsels in action movies.<br />This script I think is just about perfect and Spielberg outdid himself on the directing of the action sequences, and theintelligence, depth, and emotions are strong and crystal clear. The action sequences and the scenes throughout the movie are eye-popping and still captivate me even after watching this amazing movie countless times since the young tender age of 7 when this movie was new and they captivate me more now as I pay more attention to the action scenes. I think that the combination of awesome action scenes, funny lines, a fun and exciting atmosphere, and wonderful and intelligent storytelling all magnify each other and that is definitely the recipe for a modern day classic. The background music during some scenes is stunning as well. I can now say that \\"The Last Crusade\\" is the best of the Indiana Jones movies and was a great movie to close out the movie trilogy. It's just unfortunate that this was to be the last of the series but it was a great movie though to close out the trilogy and the legacy that these three marvelous have created continue to define action adventure movies to this very day. If there is a fourth IJ movie, it would be very difficult as the actor who played Brody is now sadly deceased. Perhaps what I think that there should be done is a spin-off of this trilogy being made involving a descendant of Jones in postmodern times like in the 2020s where that descendant would go on major action adventures in modern and futuristic times similar to what Indy went on but that was just an idea I came up with. Get all three of these movies, they're all awesome.d the intelligence, depth, and emotions are strong and crystal clear.

B000007T2Z|4.0|Godspeed you black emperor! are perhaps the most interesting and diverse of the contemporary experimental acts. This album celebrates their ability to create beautiful, atmospheric sound, and also real honest rock music. f#a# could be described as the soundtrack to the apocalypse, with the opening lyrics, and the gloomy, even depressing sounds found in east hastings. One shouldn't think of these three tracks as seperate works, i think, for there is a general mood for the  whole album. As I've said, f#a# can become a little depressing at times (especially when played repeatedly in midwinter), seeing as its main theme is the end of the world. What I feel saves the album from being overwhelmingly depressed is Godspeed's ability to really rock. This adds an optimistic element to the otherwise pessimistic piece. The build ups in the middle of East Hastings and at the end of Providence are remarkably well constructed, although simple. With f#a#, Godspeed demonstrate their ability to compose powerful rock music out of seemingly simple melodies or loops. Their ability to rock reassures me that Godspeed are not entirely dead with depression and it is this ability that many of Kranky's other bands lack. <BR>I must give some credit, however, to the way that these more dark  parts of the album are able to create pure emotion and a sense of beautiful melancholy. The commentary of Dead Flag Blues creates a lanscape for the imagination, with its simple, powerful imagery - &quot;a car's on fire but there's no driver at the wheel&quot;. For the amazingly alternative style that they have made for themselves, Godspeed certainly deserve more attention than they have received. This is good music, but be careful not to overdose.
B00006RIO7|3.0|I give it three stars because I can't listen to it from afar.  I have to get up and move my player to the next disk when it comes to the last two songs.  Why the producers put a hip-hop piece and a quasi-disco song \\"inspired\\" by the movie is beyond me.  Aside from that it has great music.
B000005ALP|1.0|I bought this CD back in '96 when I saw the video for \\"Novocaine for the Soul\\".  I listened to the rest of the album back then and found it pretty boring.  Recently, I found it again and decided to give it another try...A lot of people say that this is the kind of album that \\"grows on you\\".  Because of that, I decided to drop it into my CD changer and listen to it several times.  I did and it actually failed to grab me at all.  I still love \\"Novocain for the Soul\\" but the other songs simply sound pretty boring to me...One word review: BORING!
B00004XONN|5.0|I bought this a couple of years ago when it was first released and thought, not bad, an interesting new avenue, but not something that would bring me back for many more listens. I was convinced that alot of the buzz about this was hype.  But somehow, I do keep listening and appreciating it more and more as time goes on.  Kid A is definatly meant to be listened to as a whole rather than as individual songs. Though several of the songs are good isolated on their own, they do lose some of their power when taken out of this context.  Despite it's more instrumental nature it does not fade into the background easily, you have to listen to grasp it's pleasures.  I've seen my rating for this raise from 3.5 stars to 5.  The most exciting aspect for me is to see what I think about this 5 to 10 years down the line.  Ditto Amnesiac, which I would recommend, although it is not quite as good as Kid A.
0375414053|4.0|\\"I Don't Know How She Does It: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother\\" by Allison Pearson was a novel I really enjoyed,  because I thought it was a really accessible and poignant portrayal of the issues women still cope with as they try to \\"have it all.\\" (They struggle with sexism and male chauvinism at work, while still feeling responsible for doing everything traditionally a mother's duty at home. No one asks men how they manage to combine career and fatherhood, writes Pearson.) While the book has been compared to \\"Bridget Jones's Diary,\\" (for its colloquial tone and semi-daily-diary form), Reddy is not Jones. Jones was kind of a lovable buffoon, but Reddy is a high-ranking fund manager for a major investment bank in London. A Cambridge graduate married to an architect, Reddy tries to make sure that everyone in her life gets her 100 percent. Of course, she fails and feels herself going under as she drowns in all her commitments.<br />What I thought was most effective about the novel was the way that Pearson so clearly lets us in on the emotional conflicts that Kate has about her job and children. Reddy e-mails a friend (but doesn't send it) that though her job is very stressful, she almost views it as a vacation because her children's emotional need of her is too exhausting. She writes that in a weekend or miniholiday together, she lives through the throes of an entire relationship with her daughter Emily and son Ben, they need her, they love her, she's beautiful, they hate her, they rebel, they want intimacy, they want to be left alone.<br />Reddy performs all her duties at work and some of them at home, but it all is in an attitude of \\"I have to do this.\\" She doesn't seem to enjoy playing with her kids or doing her job; everything, including her marriage seems like an incredible burden. I thought Pearson did a good job of letting us into this woman's stressful, overextended life.<br />I did think, too, that Pearson portrayed VERY well the competition that exists among women. Reddy is very intimidated by the women she calls members of the \\"Muffia,\\" who stay at home full time, make everything home made and book entertainment for their children's parties years in advance.<br />I did not enjoy the \\"Court of Motherhood\\" sections. I thought they were redundant and boring. I also thought the ending was a little bit of a let-down, although there was still a ring of truth in the final turn of events.<br />The book is nearly pitch perfect, from my perspective, and it's funny and engaging on nearly every page. I recommend it.among women.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|If you're easily emotionally disturbed, dont watch this movie. If you have good taste in movies and havnt seen this yet, you simply MUST. I saw it probably 4 months ago, and I still think about it during my everyday life. Its without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen. <br />With nothing but Hollywood action garbage, cheesy chick flicks, and Rob Schneider movies out these days, 'Requiem for a Dream' captured my interest like no other film has done. The trippy visual effects, the repeditive sequences, and the score written by the great Clint Mansell makes the viewing experience simply mindblowing. The story is so real, the acting is so good, that I still somehow believe that the characters played are actually real people living in Coney Island. I'd recommend this movie to anyone thats sick of Hollywood and wants to experience revolutionary film making.
B00000255F|5.0|Simply stated if your 17 to 25 years of age and feeling a bit desperate or perhaps a bit confused on where life is leading you...please do yourself a favor and buy Born to Run!<br />Bruce was 25 when the this piece de resistance appeared in the racks. He sounded different ..from the previous 2 recordings (Greetings &amp; Innocent)...but this was the breakthrough.<br />It's the anthem of that particular time of your life... that you know it's out there (Thunder Road) but you don't know what it is (Night) and it might be scarier then hell (Jungleland) but you know eventually you have to try (Born to Run).<br />There have been thousands of reviews of Born to Run (147 right here)...and there's a reason for that. It's simple. We've all experienced every emotion that is explored on Born to Run.<br />My kids who are in college now often asked me what I thought were the greatest rock era recordings made (I was in the music business for 15 years). I gave them 3 recordings.<br />The Beatles - Sgt. Peppers<br />The Rolling Stones - Exile on Main Street<br />Bruce Springstenn - Born to Run<br />I can't for the life of me think of 3 greater recordings that express the art, depth of character, joy and sorrow, fun and craziness in a more poignant matter than these recordings. They may not be perfect, but that's the beauty and the soul of rock n' roll.<br />I'm 50 now, I've seen Bruce 23 times, meet him and the band on 2 different occassions. Yes, I'm a life long fan, but it all started here.<br />Enjoy it someday!
0151006903|4.0|Historical fiction is where Umberto Eco found narrative success in The Name of the Rose, and it's where he finds success in Baudolino. The Europe of centuries past provides Eco with room for both flights of fancy and detail-rich history buff trivia. This book divides nearly in half along those lines: the first half is straight -- albeit fanciful and amusing -- historical fiction, told by a narrator with a talent for embellishment. But the second half of the book drops the reader into pure fantasy-land as the character Baudolino and his archetypal ragtag group of adventurers go on a quest to the edges of the medieval maps -- into the region of the margins, where fantastical creatures and perils limited only by imagination await the traveler. There are nods to Gulliver here, and all the utterly invented history of travelers eager to entertain and impress the folks back home with their feats of daring, turning the exotic into the ever more exotic. Of course, Professor Eco's observations on human nature, politics, and philosophy shape his story as much as his desire to entertain. In the last chapters of the book, philosophy threatens to overwhelm narrative, and there are moments of new-age corn that challenge all but the most sympathetic reader. Of course, long, nerdy descriptions of European micro-politics occasionally swamp narrative too, as they did in Foucault's Pendulum. But the book's sheer joy in telling its fabulous yarn makes those missteps moot.
B00005JM1D|5.0|I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell and of course I had to go see \\"Old School,\\" his first movie since he left Saturday Night Live. I was really worried about seeing this movie I was hoping that it wasn't going to be a bad movie. Well I was pleasantly surprised. Will Ferrell went far beyond my expectation.<br />Old School is a very funny comedy about three thirty something guys who are trying to settle down with their lives but when that fails they try to recapture their college days. Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) moves into a college house and is talked into starting a fraternity by his friends. <br />The movie was great. The comedy was brilliantly unpredictable. It is really hard now a days to come up with a comedy that hasn't been done before. Old School accomplishes just that. Of course being a fan of Ferrell I am going to go out on a limb and say he made this movie what it is.<br />I give this movie a 5 out of 5. Take my advise don't listen to the critics review on this movie. Critics don't care for comedies and have judged all comedies I have seen totally wrong. If that doesn't sway you then just remember that Old school came in second in its debut weekend at the box office.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I simply love this album from start to finish. It's a melancholy, haunting exploration of heartbreak and loss, and while I don't envy Beck his obvious pain, I'm very glad he decided to share it with us. I've listened to this album four times now, and it continues to astound me with its beauty and complexity. &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; is perhaps my favorite track because of the orchestral flourishes and the way it hypnotically builds in intensity. Beck's voice on &quot;Sea Change&quot; has been described by some as droning, muddled, and muted, and to some extent, I agree. He's not a happy camper and it shows in his introspective and restrained delivery. Yes, this effort is a downer, but what a beautiful downer.
B00005U122|5.0|I have been a big fan of Pink Floyd for years. But when Roger Waters brought out his solo projects, they just did not impress me much, therefore I placed his work in the back of my mind.<br />What a mistake. This DVD looks and sound incredible. Not a flashy stage show like Pink Floyd, but Roger Waters are skilled musicians and it looks like they are having fun.<br />I will also be using this DVD to show off my home theater. It's that good.
0767817648|5.0|BLUE THUNDER is an outstanding action film that holds its own, and even surpasses some of today's Hollywood escapists fare. <br />The futuristic premise concerning the ominous prospect of the L.A. police experimenting with military hardware in preparation for the Olympics is even more profound in this day and age then it was twenty years ago.<br />The hero, played by veteran actor Roy Scheider of Jaws fame, is an L.A. police helicopter pilot assigned to test pilot an experimental attack helicopter. Later he becomes disturbed by the implications of the department using such a monstrous attack vehicle in an urban setting. Which puts him at odds with the projects secret sponsors. <br />Blue Thunder does an excellent job of combining elements of the action genre with the police thriller. Famed N.Y. film critic Pauline Kael described the film as \\"elegantly kicky\\" and that John Alonzo's night time cinematography gave the film's night shots \\"a psychedelic, futuristic quality like (the film) Alphaville.\\" Alonzo's hard photography does give the night scenes on the DVD a particularly radiant and atmospheric mood. <br />The film's only few setbacks are mainly in the first half. After a great, documentary like opener, the plot shifts into low gear. And only glosses over the intrigue and socio-political implications when it would've fared much better had it delved deeper into them. Like in one clever scene at a military demonstration site. <br />Fortunately, by the middle of the film things take a turbo charged turn as the hero and his side-kick uncover the sinister goings on and are forced to take drastic action. The aerial combat scenes are exhilirating. While the car chases on the ground provide an amusing counterpoint to an action convention. <br />All in all, a great DVD. Providing great acting, an intriguing premise and thrilling action.

B00005JLXC|2.0|I was rather dissapointed by this movie; it just did not live up to my expectations or the hype. There was not enough character developement, and Dare Devil's \\"partener\\" was greatly misadvertised in the previews. I don't want to spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it, but Elektra and Dare Devil do not team up to fight evil like the previews suggest.<br />Visually, the movie was good. The fight scenes were very well well choriographed and the special effects were above par. It's no Matrix or Lord of the Rings, but then again, what movie is? Visually it was about equal to Spiderman.<br />As for the casting, Michael Clarke Duncan plays a very good Kingpin, and was a very good actor to pick for the role. I don't think Ben Afleck is someone I would imagine as Dare Devil, though he does play the role well.<br />I would not recomend seeing this movie, especially if you are expecting an equivelent to Spider-Man. Dare Devil fans might enjoy it though.<br />One other thing to note, especially for people who think the movie is like Spider-Man: this is a rather violent movie, especially for younger audiences. Compared to other Action movies, there's not as much killing, but it seems that everyone who dies or is injured is brutally stabed, not just shot or punched/kicked. So if that kind of thing bothers you, definatly don't watch it.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|This disk can serve as a model of how to do it right. The restoration is virtually flawless. I can't imagine the picture looking any better at its Berlin premiere so many decades ago. Missing passages (about 30 mins.) are filled in with narrative cards so that now the plot makes sense. (It never did in earlier versions that I'd seen.) The symphonic score, which survives, has been orchestrated and joined to the film, a most moving impression. With excellent features on the making of the film and its restoration, plus a splendid commentary by a leading Lang scholar, this DVD will long hold a high place in my library. If you love \\"Metropolis\\" as much as I do, you owe yourself the pleasure of owning and viewing (repeatedly, as I already have) this splendid disk.
B00004SCS1|5.0|Ok, So the clean version is not the best.  After i go this I bought the explicit version and its better.  Ddevil, Sugar, Suite-pee, War?.  Some of my favorite songs are on this album.  Serj Tankians lyrics, Daron Malakian on guitar, Shavo Odajian and the bass, and the amazing John Dalmayan on set.  System of a Down represents everything that Metal should be today.  If it weren't for them, theres no way I would listen to the radio at all.  Armenian metal is by far the best idea in music today.  BUY THIS ALBUM!!!  NOW!!! STOP READING, JUST GO!!!  WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS?!?!?!?!
B00005JM1D|5.0|I laughed for a good 60 to 70 minutes during this film. It starts right at the beginning and really does not let up. Critics are really funny about this film ... they seem to take shots at the movie because it's not some stuffy MIRAMAX-let's-buy-us-an-Oscar-type film, yet they all admit that they laughed?!? <br />It's a film can not be a comedy for the sake of being a comedy. Films that make an audience laugh this much should be hailed and not pilloried.
0805062971|5.0|This book is one of the most incredible analyses of the concept of Nihilism from every aspect. While the movie concentrated on a love story, the book concentrates on a truly incredible idea. Nihilism as a concept must be somewhat understood before one can truly understand the statement of this work.<BR>One should note that the very conclusion of the book suggests strongly that Palahniuk does not wish one to embrace Nihilism. Even in an interview he explained some of his ideas and essentially if not exactly that. <BR>But the focus is not the avocation of a belief system, or even an attack on a belief system, but a complete analysis of Nihilism. Even the style and structure of the book was inherently Absurdist, a literary style that arose from Existentialism, of which Nihilism is part. Down to every detail this work is finely crafted, and the greater one's understanding of the concepts the more apt on is to enjoy this work, though it is enjoyable for nearly all. However, the greater the understanding of the concepts involved the more valuable the book is. Without understanding the essential concepts of this book it can create reactions retrograde to the author's own intentions.<br />By the way, I love this book and I acutally first read it just a few hours south of Portland. Some may know that Palahniuk lives in Portland. For some reason reading a book about something farmiliar so near it's source has quite an impact on someone and I do believe the impression left by Fight Club has only become deeper with my greater understanding of the subject.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie is the of he best war films out, and the only true Vietnam War movie my family and I have seen. This movie stayed very close to historical facts, and made the open-field battle in the Ia Drang valley seem so real, my father was in Cambodia, right across the border when this happened, so he knows a thing or two how real it was, a must see if you think RAMBO, or in that case, ANY OTHER Vietnam War is the best on this war out there...

I need someone to sit me down and walk me through this like I'm a 2 year old, cause I just don't hear what all the fuss is about.<BR>Laconic to the point of being audio Sominex, I don't know how the band stayed awake for the whole concert. There's no point in referencing the audience reaction. The French will clap for anything. I've watched the DVD on really expensive Bang and Olufsen plasma gear and I still don't find my pulse doing anything other than slowing down. This is the soundtrack for plays by Samuel Beckett, and makes one just want to snap one's fingers and tap one's toes to John Cage's \\"Three Minutes of Silence.\\"<BR>Much hoopla was made about her rendition of \\"Look of Love\\" and \\"A Case of You\\", PUUHHHLLEASSE! Dusty Springfield she aint, and Joni Mitchell should sue. No sensuality and no tragedy stains her delivery. <BR>If necessary, close the border. That's enough of lifelessness posing as music. Diana Krall makes Cowboy Junkies sound like a hyper-kinetic punk band. At one point I thought the worst record I ever heard was Philip Glass and Ravi Shankar (who thought that up?), but I got a new nightmare: Diana Krall and Crazy Horse.....
B00006JDSI|3.0|Instead of 5 stars i give 3 to this edition, and here's why:<br />I am a fan of the original stuffs, in this case, i bought this edition thinking about the entire classic movie, with a new and improved transfer and without modifications, you know what i mean, just THE apropiated subtitles, additional opcional bg music and the DVD original special features. <BR>I have to tell you that this is transfer of a 'colored version' of the movie. Sometime long ago,  someone gave color to the movie: instead of the original black &amp; white, there's black &amp; red when the scene happens during the afternoon, black &amp; yellow in the morning, black &amp; blue in the night...etc.<BR>Another thing, for example: when a caracter reads a letter , this edition replaced the original close ups of the letter and it's contents for a computer generated draw of the letter and its's content, as you can imagine, with funny word fonts in english. This makes a great contrast between the really old movie and the clear old-simulated texts. I think this is a lack of good taste. <br />If you don't care about this little details, just buy it, it's a good and improved editon. A really new way to see and apreciate this classic.
B000031XCR|3.0|The first 2/3rds of this CD is packed with hits!  Unfortunately the end has songs I  never heard before... but still worth buying.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne's Let Go is a very well rounded soundtrack. From ballads like \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Tommorow\\" to catchy pop songs like \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" to powerhouse pop-rock songs like \\"Unwanted\\" and \\"Losing Grip.\\" Though the lyrics are sometimes unthoughtful and forced, the messages show strong meaning and shine through the songs. Most of the songs don't get old and are very listenable multiple times, except for the radio friendly songs \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and \\"Complicated.\\" <br />Lavigne is off to a great start with this album and it has been named \\"soundtrack to my life\\" from many teenage girls, but I'll be expecting more mature lyrics and more input from her on her next album.<br />And do not base your opinion of her music based on her personality and apperance (even though most of it is WAY overblown), her album is very worth a try...
0312305060|1.0|This is one of the very few time I can say -- skip the book and see the movie!  I hated the book because it was contrived, badly plagurized and difficult to read.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|a lush, mournful feeling all its own. The soundtrack to [[ASIN:B000005IXM Mishima: A Life In Four Chapters (1985 Film)]] has long been one of my favorite CDs by Philip Glass. The Kronos Quartet delivered a richly emotional performance then that finally revealed the emotional potential of Glass's compositions. With The Hours, the Lyric Quartet and Michael Riesman deliver in the same vein.<br /><br />I bought this because it was the latest from PG. So I haven't seen the movie and can't comment on how it works for the movie. But I can say with all candor that listening to this soundtrack has given me a powerful desire to see the film. Something that I wouldn't have imagined ever wanting to do.<br /><br />There are some recycled bits of music in this soundtrack (notably from Satyagraha), but even that track is transformed from a largely choral piece to a purely instrumental one and benefits thereby.<br /><br />For those whose only exposure to PG is [[ASIN:B000005J28 Glass: Einstein on the Beach (1993 Recording)]] (ugh) or [[ASIN:B00000AEDU Koyaanisqatsi (1998 Re-recording)]], this will be a pleasant surprise. The tone is warm and emotional, the pace langorous rather than forced.<br /><br />Judged purely as a composition, The Hours will be placed as a footnote in the PG canon. Little, if any, new ground is broken. But I can't say it enough - this is passionate, powerful music that is moving and eminently listenable. I know I've already listened to it more than anything I've heard in the last six months.
B00005AR3G|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a Disney animated feature this much since ALADDIN.<br />Instead of a single standout performance (Robin Williams in ALADDIN) carrying the show, this one features an outstanding ensemble voice cast supported by some of the most frenetic animation ever to come out of Disney. This just might be my favorite animated film, ever.<br />Definitely a Disney film at heart (no jabs at anyone are intended to be taken seriously), THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is peppered with the kind of sight gags, action and dialogue that we're accustomed to seeing in classic Warner Brothers Looney Toons--it particularly shows in the diner scene, complete with the monotone career waitress who wouldn't get excited if her hair was on fire, the disgruntled chef who's heard one too many critiques of his greasy-spoon cooking, and heroic, sweet, dimwitted Kronk taking over in the kitchen in the midst of flapping doors and shouted orders.<br />Credit goes to David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton for making this odd collection of circumstances and locations pull together into a madcap film the whole family can enjoy. It all feels like the animation is there to support the great performances--to deliver on the promise of the masterful voice tracks. Of particular note are Kitt's wonderfully manic Yzma and Warburton's Kronk...the huge, hapless, genial guy who just happened to end up working for the wrong side.<br />Ultimately, this oddball buddy picture feels like something out of the Hope & Crosby heyday, poking fun at itself as it goes and firing off throwaway gags that hit more often than they miss.<br />It ends with the requisite Disney happy ending with moral, but it handles it with subtlety, without leaving that cloying Disney after-taste.<br />Not to be missed, but not for everyone: people who like this one tend to love it. If your tastes run to the wacky side, this one's for you.
B00005JM1D|4.0|Walking into the theater, I honestly wasnt expecting much though I was looking forward to it. I thought I was about to see a predictable, episodic movie of stupid jokes and gross out gags. By the movie's end, I was thrilled I spent money on it. Not only were the jokes and situations funny but it was also acted well. Luke Wilson did a good job in a role that doesn't call for much, which is fine. It was easy for me to assume, even though I have aspirations for him, that Will Ferrell would recreate some whacky SNL character he has played before.  However, he was not only hysterical but he played his character with sincerity and proved he can do much more than a random SNL character. Fast talking Vince Vaughn was terrific as usual, his lines delivered with sharp and accurate timing and all deadpan.  His character, as well, was humanized and not a caricature or redundant character that a film of this kind could too easily churn out. Jeremy Piven gleefully waltzed through all his scenes as the antagonist dean with ease while making the audience hate him but be able to laugh at the same time as opposed to way too many comedic \\"villians.\\" Ellen Pompeo adds just the right femininity to an otherwise mostly male oriented film to not oversaturate it and make her love interest into an obligation by the end of the film. <br />Very funny, very worth it. Not a masterpiece but much better than many of the other comedies that would seem to be similar but are only so on the surface.
B00006JSS8|5.0|What an amazing CD - what an amazing artist.  This Stevie Wonder collection is just the perfect thing for drives home, cleaning the house, getting ready for a night out, or hanging out by a fire with friends.  This CD will actually put you in a great mood and you will start singing the lyrics to his songs and swaying your body to his music.  Great buy!  Thanks Stevie!
B00005YXZH|4.0|I really don't see what the big deal is. I don't think this is so demanding. This is a very listenable album, plenty catchy, hooky, etc. -- all one asks from a rock n' roll record. No one will ride with you in your car and object, my friends. <BR>   In fact that's the only problem I have with this record. I was expecting something &quot;experimental&quot; and way, way far out. Instead I can play this for any party and ignorant folk assume it is the Beatles. And why not? As if there aren't 50 other Jim O'Rourke-twiddled-with albums out there by so many bands all doing the pop thing with &quot;jarring&quot; sonic effect overlay. &quot;Big deal&quot;, people. <BR>     However, this is a cut above whatever the latest Stereolab album is, or new band with members of Tortoise (Jim O'Rourke producing), etc. because it really is a very good pop album with strongly written songs that are enhanced by the overlay and not &quot;adjusted&quot; by it. One asks though when we are going to get a real band where the Rock and the Beeps/Bloops are indistinct and one identity, the way a band like Can was.
B000002U8A|4.0|Super strong album, but a bit overdone. For perfection, try RIO.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol was the best of the lot in the 80s. Other excellent bands were there (New Order, Psychedelic Furs), but Idol is the most original and the most rebellious. This CD ties all of his best stuff into a CD of palatable length. He did some really good remixes of a couple of his songs (Don't worry, folks...he didn't take a sledgehammer to the remixed songs!) The acoustic version of \\"Rebel Yell\\" recorded in '93 is superb, especially through good speakers. Billy Idol is a talented guy, no doubt. This CD is your best bet if, like me, you have room in your collection for only one Billy Idol CD.
B000088E6D|5.0|My gosh!   What a rich, posh, fun-filled sounding CD.   I own a Bikram yoga studio, and for fun, I played it in my reception area as well as in the changing rooms.   And I gotta say, all my students loved it!   The swinging sound was such a wonderful change from the quieter meditative stuff that I often play (and what most people expect to hear) at my Bikram yoga studio.   &quot;That's All&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; are my personal favorites.   My students like &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love.&quot;   I even gave a copy to Mom.   She loves it too.   Grab a copy.   You'll be glad you did!
B000021XS0|5.0|I had only by accident gained any interest in Dream Theatre, and without hearing any songs I purchased this album.  I really should do that more often because I have done that with three or four CDs in the past and all have turned out to be stellar examples of music.  <br />Being the first album that I heard from Dream Theatre I was quite ecstatic to find that there was a band who had managed to do what I have always wanted to hear.  And that is tell an intelligent story, with the backing of an absolutely incredible band, or &quot;orchestra&quot; in this case.  The first thing that I noticed with this album was how they managed to bring all their instuments into what can only be described in the ironically inferior term, &quot;wall of sound.&quot;  John Petrucci is on par with the greatest guitarists of our time, including Joe Satriani.  John Myung has been doing superior bass lines since the band started out, and allows for more depth.  The speed that Mike Portnoy plays the drums can sometimes be staggering, and while he may sometimes fall into nothing more that a montone beat, it never lessens the impact of the music, and when he plays, he really plays.  Jordan Rudess has been showing some amazing keyboarding to the world for a while, and he fits well into the Dream Theatre crew as well.  And James Labrie may not be the best vocalist, in fact I won't lie, he's only half decent on vocals, but he still seems to compliment the rest of the band excellently.  <br />I'd say that any band that can carry you for over 74 minutes with music that remains in the top of the grade of all music ever created has a rare gift.  And the only band that I've ever seen that even come close to these guys for sheer progresive metal length and depth would be, Tool.  Who also happens to be the only band that I consider to be on the same level for craftsmanship and depth in their music as Dream Theatre.  While there are other groups who can continually surprise me with spectacular music, such as Pat Metheny and his group, and Silverchair who have crafted a masterful record with Diorama, while not on the same page, or even attemting to be as Dream Theatre, they still have managed to get on the same page in quality, none have yet to impress me more that this album.  The most basic thing I can say to show how much I have grown to adore Dream Theatre would be that all prog rock or jazz albums I hear now I compare to Dream Theatre's albums.<br />Awake is also a very good album, as is, A Change of Seasons.  I have not heard all of their other works, but I have heard their new album, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, and it is not as good as I had hoped.  Althought it does sound very much like a Tool album, especially Anima, and that never made any group sound bad.
B000002MFN|3.0|This CD is good, but personally, I think out of all of Madonna's CD's, 'Ray of Light' was absolutely the BEST!!
B00008K78M|5.0|There are 2 types of great singers...The ones that sound great in a CD...others are better on stage. well, Laura is definietaly in both categories. <BR>The first time I saw her Live, I was shocked by just listening to her... She is such a great performer, and finally I have a chance to keep a little bit from this experience at home. This DVD will transmit some of her excellent performance. Her voice will reach your heart and soul. She can sing anything she wants to sing... is so much strengh...sweetness and feeling at the same time. I recommend this DVD 200%. So buy it,enjoy it and I'm sure you'll want to be on her concert!!!

He saves a girl, Kagero and is drawn in to a web of treachery facing dangers only gods should face.<br />My advice: By the movie to find out more, and you will see one of the greatest animes of all time!
B00006IX0R|5.0|This has got to be the best album that came out in 2002. Even if one's not a Cranberries fan, this album has a little bit of something for everyone. All best songs from the past are included (even though there are still some other great songs) and the latest single - &quot;Stars&quot; is just simply great. I couldn't help myself listening to it for several times everytime. The song is a true Cranberries trade mark - beautiful, melodic, good beat and just pure simple music. Very addictive. Every music lover should have this CD. One of the greatest 'best of...' albums of the decade!!
B00005AAFS|5.0|Once again the German band Rammstein has done it. (For people who dont know a word of German and don't get the joke above, Mutter translated in English is Mother) I'm not one to complain but Out of all their albums Sensucht has to be their worst by far. Mutter coming in first and Herzeleid coming in second. Live Aus Berlin is OK if you like Rammstein live. (Personaly I like their studio recordings better)<br />When it all comes down to it this is Rammstein's best! With hardcore lyrics and great melodies, there is no time to waist buying this album! <br />Next we come to Reviewing the songs<BR>Mein Herz Brennt: 10/10 One of the best songs on the album!<BR>Links 234: 8/10 OK if you like German march songs<BR>Sonne: 10/10 loved it completly and totaly!<BR>Ich Will: 10/10 Watch this music video!<BR>Feuer Frei!: 10/10 Well it has to be great to be on a movie as great as Triple X!<BR>Mutter: 10/10 Loved it because it was a nice slow change<BR>Spielphur: 10/10 Great song! One of the best on the album!<br />Zwitter: 7/10 Could have been better..<BR>Rein Raus: 7/10 [worst] song on the album<BR>Adios: 10/10 Great song!<BR>Nebel: 9/10 Not bad, still good, but could use some work<br />Summary of the album:<BR>Great and awesome!...To sum it all up I love this album! This will be a great album to those who love Techno-Rock or are just HARDCORE RAMMSTEIN FANS! It is in my opinion that stop denying yourself a great album and go and buy this CD!
B00001ZULV|5.0|Genesis were indisputably the 80's version of the Beatles, racking up an impressive number of gold records, starring in a handful of slapstick musical comedy films (\\"Genesis Meet Dracula\\", \\"The Illegal Aliens\\"), and breaking concert attendance records at such notable venues as Shea Stadium, the Hollywood Bowl and Madison Square Garden. Often the incessant screaming of teenage girls rendered the band's live performances inaudible (a phenomenon documented in the \\"Three Sides Live\\" CD.) Even a \\"Phil Collins is dead\\" hoax circulated for a time, prompted by alleged backwards messages buried in the song \\"Abacab\\" and suspicious album cover artwork. This CD does a good job representing this intoxicating period of Genesis-mania and nearly all of their biggest hits are accounted for. It would have been nice had this compilation included the live version of \\"Turn it on again\\" (which Phil Collins often performed shirtless to the delight of his female fans), as the \\"Duke\\" version here is somewhat anticlimactic. Only one Peter Gabriel-era track made the cut, the eccentric \\"I know What I Like\\", and perhaps a separate compilation is warranted for the band's early progressive years. Not for the hardcore Genesis fan, but more than adequate for the average listener.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD. It is unique, warm, pleasant, romantic. Norah Jones brings back quality, and class to the music industry.
0316666343|3.0|Although the story dragged a bit at times, it held my interest in spite of the gore.  What I think I wanted to read was Susie's return, which of course was impossible.  I could not understand why Abigail left the family. Seibold's definition of Santa Rosa, CA as &quot;upscale&quot; is laughable, as it never was and to this day not.<br />I final part of the book was slow and boring, no answers and no direction.
B00006830P|5.0|Pay the extra $...bucks and get this version over the American one.  The American version is skimpy, with less than an hour on disc 1, and just barely over an hour on disc 2, while this Australian version has over 77 minutes per disc, and includes more of his best material, including \\"I Want You\\", a hit that was left off of the American version.

0385486804|5.0|I found this book on The Ishmael Community under Daniel Quinn's recommended reading list. Quinn put this book on there to let his readers know that going off into the bush by yourself ill-prepared isn't a good idea. This book opened my eyes to what it would really be like to &quot;walk away&quot; from civilization by myself, and live off the land hunting/gathering by myself.<br />It also gave me some insight into what Christopher McCandless was thinking, and searching for. As you read Into the Wild you will find that McCandless wasn't your ordinary man in his early twenties. Like a lot of people who live in this civilization/taker culture McCandless realized there was a lot of things wrong with this way of life and wanted something different. Krakauer lays out the reasons why McCandless wanted something different very well for the reader. He also sheds some light on the similarities between himself and McCandless, and why he wanted something different at McCandless's age. After reading Into the Wild I don't think anybody could have told the story any better than Jon Krakauer.
B00005JKG9|3.0|Let me say that this is a really solid movie with great performances. I'd give the film itself 4 stars, but docked one for the purposes of this review due to a rather lackluster roster of extras.<br />Two disc set? Come on, some of this stuff is just boring. The all-new \\"documentary\\", ABC, is not even about the movie! It's just a bunch of salesman rambling on about their jobs. The commentary from James Foley wasn't worth my time, too dry. But the actor's commentaries are really entertaining and enjoyable. But the Jack Lemmon tribute is a fairly embarrassing piece, one that I will never watch again. That's how I feel about the entire second disc, it'll never come out of the case again.<br />But the movie will, and when all is said and done, that's what matters.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Movie was in great condition!  Just like new!  Highly recommeneded!
B00003CWTI|1.0|Stay away from this movie.  The whole movie was pointless and boring.  Reading some of these reviews you might get the idea that the movie has a deep plot.  It doesn't, it is about as deep as a van damne movie.  Ohhh and the ending is terrible. Please don't waste three hours of your life.
B00005JLZL|4.0|What's your stance on capital punishment? Whatever it is, The Life of David Gale probably won't change it; It is, however, enjoyable for what it is, which is basically a whodunit.<br />  Kevin Spacey plays David Gale, a death-row convict with 4 days to go until his execution. He agrees to spend two hours a day speaking with Reporter Bitsy Bloom (Kate Winslet), and as he tells her his story, we learn the reason he's about to be executed. Gale, formerly a high-profile opponent of the death-penalty, has been convicted of the rape and murder of his Death Watch partner Constance (Laura Linney). Bitsy believes Gale is innocent, and sets out to find the evidence that will overturn his conviction.<br />  The film is told mainly in flashback, and the many twists and turns the plot takes will have you rehashing those scenes in your mind for days trying to uncover clues, much like another Spacey film, The Usual Suspects. I can see the \\"Twist Ending\\" of a film coming a mile off, and after I solved the mystery here, the filmmakers threw in one more twist that I didn't see coming at all. The ending revelation is pretty far-fetched, but it's a neat twist nonetheless. The film goes a little overboard with it's anti-death-penalty politics at times, but never to the point of annoyance. The Life of David Gale is worth a look for all the armchair detectives out there.
B00000K19E|5.0|Simply put, this is a great movie.  Everything from the acting to the special effects is perfect.  The storyline could not have been written better.  The directing does things we had never seen before, now unfortunately everyone is doing it.  If you haven't seen this movie, go and see it before the second one comes out.  If you want to know what it is about read one of the other fifty reviews.
0151008116|5.0|This book and &quot;9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power&quot; are the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had in the past 18 months. &quot;Pi&quot; was pure entertainment, while &quot;9 Free Secrets&quot; was both entertaining and enriching personally on the deepest level. My highest recommendations on both.
B00005JM1D|4.0|I am a huge Animal House fan so when they compared Old School to it I was very excited.  Will Ferrell is hilarious in this movie.  He practically carries it.  Ohhh and Vince Vaughn is pretty good to.  Not a must see, but go see for some great laughs.
B00000JRTX|5.0|Classic Hugh Grant.  Loved this movie so much I had to purchase it.
B00005JL78|5.0|Awesome !  Beautifull graphics-photography, <BR>   Dark utopic history and a superb action movie<BR>   by Tom Cruise
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese is perfect in this.  Loved this movie so much I had to purchase it.
031286504X|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is not to be thought of as anything other than a masterpiece. Unfortunately, I had to give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because the accompanying short stories that fill out the other half of the book aren't remotely as good. It doesn't matter though, because \\"I Am Legend\\" is just too powerful a story to pass up.
B000002HMH|3.0|My one advice for this cd is the quicker you realize that Metallica is no longer a thrash metal band the better. If you put this cd up against a majority of rock cds out there, you'll actually find that this is still a good album. I know I might get some negative feedback from this, but I thought this is better than the Black Album. I thought Jame's lyrics were much better, and I thought the production was a lot more solid. \\"Ain't My B****\\" is the first song that makes you realize the new transformation. From the get go you can tell that the metal days are long gone, and that the hard rock/alternative style is the way to go. If you thought \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" was a soft song wait until you hear \\"Mama Said\\". It could be classified as a country song by many. \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"House That Jack Built\\" shows that they can still jam for 6-7 minutes like the old days. \\"Waste My Hate\\" and \\"King Nothing\\" still shows they can rock out.  Overall i'd give this more like 3 and a half but i can't do that. I'd say if your just getting into rock i'd start here or on Garage Inc. ReLoad was pure [junk] sorry to say.
B000006045|5.0|I have all of Massive Attack's albums (including 100th Window), but this is far and away their best, and in my top ten albums of the 90's.  Don't think -- just buy it.
B00000AFGM|4.0|A lot like Metallica once you realize that these artists plan on evolving their music, quicker you realize the sheer brillance of this album. This is the second part of Manson's brillant trilogy that ended with Holy Wood.<br />Manson's lyrics are just as breathtaking as Antichrist Superstar. Some songs deal with the material world that we live in and the life of love then betrayal. I thought \\"Speed of Pain\\" is one of Manson's best written songs ever. His vocals on \\"Speed of Pain\\" and \\"Coma White\\" shows that Manson is more than a repititive screamer.<br />Musically is where and why this album was so controversial. Many fans were appauled by the new sound and its what later lead to Manson's poor album sales of Holy Wood and Golden Age of Grosteque. The sound is very David Bowie-ish type of 80's sound that is really catchy. What many fans don't realize is that Manson had this type of sound mapped out before Antichrist Superstar came out.<br />I'd say this is my third favorite Manson album behind Holy Wood and Antichrist Superstar which were monumental albums in my opinion for his music career. I'd say this has better lyrics than Golden Age... and i'm not a big fan of American Portrait... simply because its just not good sound. I'd recommend this only if your open minded and truly grasp what Manson was trying to accomplish.
0066620996|5.0|This is probably the best business book I have ever read. Too many business books today are related to who can be the most popular CEO, a loving/touchy feely manager, and end up on the cover of business week the most. This research shows the opposite. You need to be modest, work hard and get hard working people around you. You don't try to change people or sculpt them. You boot them off the bus and get someone on board with the same work ethic. <BR>And Collins backs it up with an unbelievable amount of research. If you're a manager or any level, you must read this book. We've implemented many of the principles discussed already and have seen impact.
B000066C6Z|3.0|The Movie (5 stars):  A classic comedy by the makers of AIRPLANE!  Watch it several times and try to pick out all of the humor, even in the credits at the end.<BR>DVD Quality (1 star): I am currently returning my second &quot;Top Secret!&quot; DVD due to problems with quality.  If you buy a DVD, make sure you watch it right away!
0684803356|4.0|The political passions that drove Spain to the brink and over the brink of national insanity have almost been forgotten now, but Hemingway's great novel of those times remains.  Both fascism and communism have been consigned to the ash heap of history, but we still get here some sense of how the people of that nation were clawing at each other for barely understood reasons.  Hemingway's handling of his material is almost beyond praise; it's a genuinely great novel, and a full workout of his trademark and massively influential prose style.  The only flaw is the character of Maria and the instantaneous love affair the author cooks up between this refugee and the American interloper Robert Jordan.  Amidst the dramatic and desperate events of the story it just doesn't ring true.  I would rate this Hemingway's second best novel, after &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;
B000060P79|5.0|I love Simple Plan. They're just awesome. Not too punk, but just enough. If you're looking for some good music (in general), you should definitely get this CD.
0316666343|2.0|This book was highly recommended to me, even by those who know I am a parent whose only child died as a teenager. I was captivated by it at first, but then was jolted out of the story by clumsy editing, which is an unforgivable flaw in a book like this -- especially when the author thanks so many people for proofreading it for her to catch errors. But how did they miss a description of people leaning on the dishwasher in the kitchen --which precedes a whole scene of the mother and grandmother washing dishes manually?? And the same twosome take a post-Thanksgiving dinner stroll in Pennsylvania where one of them listens to crickets and admires fireflies clustering over flowerbeds. In November?? In Pennsylvania?? Beyond editing flaws, there are serious flaws in the depiction of certain characters' behavior  -- as a bereaved parent, I will tell you that no one who has lost a child through an unexplained disappearance will EVER casually leave their young son at a public play area in a mall while they go to meet a lover. (WERE there play areas in malls in the early 70s??? I never saw one.)Guess she figured he'd be just fine, how could anything bad happen to a little kid by himself in a public play area? After all, she signed him in with the supervisor!!  I'd expect far better editing from a major publisher AND from the author's many friends who seem to have been far too uncritical -- or perhaps the book was even worse before they helped. While the book can't be rewritten, it can certainly be re-edited to fix the most obvious errors in the paperback edition.
B000001OAA|5.0|Shirley Manson is the greatest female artist to grace this planet! Her lyrics are genius and very clever. You can always relate to any of her songs. Whenever i'm in a bad mood, Shirley Manson's lyrics and voice definately make me feel better. I've had this album for 3 years, and it has never gotten old. I listen to it as much as i did when i first got it!
B00005YXZH|4.0|After just a couple listens I think I \\"get\\" what Jeff Tweedy was trying to do, although I can also see why Reprise and the narrow-minded Grammy folks didn't.<BR> <BR>YHF could have easily been a safe collection of conventionally recorded, well crafted folk-pop songs like Mermaid Avenue Vol. 1 and 2, and may have even won some awards that way, but would not have had nearly the impact.  The songs stand up well on their own unadorned. But instead, Tweedy and company have carefully constructed a concept album that sustains an auditory metaphor in a many-layered way that only gets more interesting with repeated listenings.  I heard Tweedy discussing the origins of the title on World Cafe and remembered hearing something about the mysterious shortwave \\"number stations,\\" and that turns out to be the key to the whole puzzle.  (Wasted a couple hours surfing the net and learning about them, too.) The underlying theme of this CD is communication, or the failure of communication, specifically fractured communication in a disintegrating relationship, represented by the sounds of elaborately coded, one-way messages truly \\"broad-cast\\" into the air without any way to determine if they have been understood, let alone received, by their target.  This works well on the surface level of two people trying in vain to communicate with each other in an intimate way, but at the next level it can also represent every artist's battle to reach an audience and have a complex message heard and properly appreciated. (Just remember Reagan adopting \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" or Bush using \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" on the campaign trail to see how easily a message can be twisted to mean its exact opposite.)  That way it also becomes a metaphor for the CD's well-documented difficulties in reaching the market.<BR> <BR>A low tech, cold-war relic technology is also a powerful symbol in these days of instant electronic communication and information overload.  The ghostly sample of the broadcast repeating \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" over the end of \\"Poor Places\\" sounds like intentional jamming of the narrators' message, also a common occurrence in the shadowy world of number stations.<BR> <BR>Then there's \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You,\\" an exuberant, somewhat mainstream love song punctuated by some of the most jagged, ugly, dissonant and downright angry acid-rock guitar ever to appear on a major label record.  I heard that one on the radio and initially reacted, like I suspect Reprise did, \\"this would be a great song without that [bad] guitar part.\\"  Now I can't hear it without it.  It's as if one side of the conflicted narrator is professing his devotion while the other side is screaming at his lover in rage, \\"Goddammit, I'm the bleeping man who bleeping loves you!  Why can't you understand that!\\"  It's part of the text of the song. In the space of one tune this goes from the exhilaration of Sgt. Pepper to the despair of Tonight's the Night.  The whole record is like that.  I can't even think of another recording that pulled that off in a single song.  Maybe A Day In The Life but that took the likes of both a Lennon and a McCartney plus George Martin.<BR> <BR>Using noise, electronica and dissonance are hip, gimmicky production tricks these days but here they are integral to the songs and the underlying narrative, which is one of loss and frustration.  So much has been made of Beck's love life and the CD it produced, but nobody seems to be asking what the hell happened to Tweedy to produce a work of such emotional depth.<BR> <BR>Finally, I can't help note that despite all the references to the Beatles (especially the White Album and \\"I Want You/She's So Heavy\\"), Radiohead, Pink Floyd, U2's Achtung Baby, etc., nobody seems to have noticed how much Tweedy's voice recalls Ray Davies all over the place, especially in the one song that seems to stand apart from the rest of the concept/story, the nostalgic \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" which could be an updated and Americanized \\"Come Dancing.\\"<BR> <BR>Anyway, this CD won't leave my player for a while and might still be selling briskly in a few decades like Dark Side of the Moon  - it's in that league.
B000024D4R|4.0|Animals is one of pink floyd's most underated albums. It's a powerful pieces of music that lashes out at everyone. It's roger waters simply being roger waters, but in this case, that's a good thing. But don't leave out David Gilmour whose guitar work is classic, especially on &quot;Dogs&quot;. That song is to me, the best on the album. I'm usually a type of person who doesn't like really long songs. I get bored half-way into them. there 's only 5 songs on this one, and 3 of them are over 10 minutes long each. But in this case, the balance between long organ parts, sound effects, guitar solos, and lyrics is extremely good.you can't get bored while listening to these songs.A great album. period.
B00008A7QK|5.0|Marc Bolan was on the verge of superstardom worldwide, and Electric Warrior almost made it big here, but was never able to obtain the American success he wanted. Sure, Bang a Gong was great, but there are so many more treasures in the T.Rex catalog. I still believe that Warner Bros.didn't release the right choices for singles, but that's just my opinion. The sound quality of this reissue surpasses the import remaster on A&M last year. And this time, the wonderful \\"Mambo Sun\\" is not shortened annoyingly like the reissue. The bonus material are all classics and the packaging is superb, also much better than the import version. Included is the cool inner picture of Marc sitting in the chair as a poster!! Well done, Rhino/Reprise. Now release the brown 1971 \\"T.Rex\\" album with bonus tracks i.e. Deep Summer and I will be a truly happy man!
B000002KNY|5.0|Fear of Music challenges the listener to enter an uncomfortable and claustrophobic space, but also a totally listenable, syncopated, driving angular space and asks you to stay with it until the Drugs take over (the last song on the album).  Another reviewer likened this space to \\"madness\\" and I agree -- the album's a song cycle from a paranoid drug trip.  Induce the same state while listening to this album and you'll find its Rosetta Stone.  You won't fully understand the brilliance recorded until you do.<br />This is not casual listening music.  Don't use it as background music.  One quiet night, perhaps when it's raining or cold outside and you don't know what to do with yourself, play this CD from beginning to end in a darkened room with a couple of candles burning.  Concentrate.  Concentrate harder.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
B00004W52U|5.0|Who needs caffiene when there's Operation Ivy? This album is title fits it better than you can imagine, sitting still while listening to Operation Ivy is far beyond my skills.<br />Lyrically advanced music, especially considering how young Jesse and Lint were in their Op Ivy days, is welcome in contrast of the meaningless junk that floods the radio waves in this day and age. Politics, social issues, and of course, the music itself are all sung of in fast, energetic lyrics, accompanied by bouncy rythms on guitar and bass.<br />While Lint (Time Armstrong) and Matt went on to form the much better known band Rancid, I think Operation Ivy is an epitome of everything music should be, empowering, energizing, concious, meaningful... I could go on forver. Operation Ivy influenced a myriad of good bands, and if you can't connect with these lyrics, than you're obviously inhuman...<br />These are timeless songs, as current today as they were in '88.<br />I only regret that the problems Jesse sings of are still present today for me to relate to....
B00005YW4H|1.0|I have to admit. I only listened to her album because of her Grammy wins. Her jazz is really nothing extraordinary and all the songs sound flat. Her voice is pretty monotonous too. If I could give this album &quot;no stars&quot;, I would. Her music gives me a headache.
B000002UY5|5.0|This cd without a doubt is the greatest rock n roll cd ever. Blind melon is extrodinary. Shannon's voice is awesome. The melodies and rhythm is the best I have ever heard. The song &quot;change&quot; is incredible. If you lik Led Zepplin and The Black Crowes you will love Blind Melon. Or If you are a hippy you'll love it more.
0380799006|5.0|I am in love with this book.  When my second child was first<BR>born, I read the first chapter or two of this book and found it<BR>very useful for dealing with my older child's jealous behavior.<BR>Now that my second is 1 1/2 and the two children are playing<BR>together and having so many conflicts, I picked the book back<BR>up and read it from cover to cover.  There are so many helpful<BR>anecdotes.  The book has given me words to handle so many <BR>frustrating situations.  It is one of my favorite <BR>books on child-raising!
B00008A7QK|3.0|The English reissue of this features many bonus demo versions of the songs on the proper album but, more importantly, it was re-mastered by original producer Tony Visconti and George Marino. It is much warmer and stronger than this US version, which was remastered by Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch in their typically harsh, tinny way. Go to amazon.co.uk now! And it's a near-perfect album.
B00005A46T|1.0|The only reason the rating on this piece of .... is so high is because of all you little mallcore fans that think that this is the absolute \\"heaviest thing you've ever heard in your life.\\" These are the same little kids that come to school with their hair parted like a girl, wearing old dirty Slipknot shirts, wearing about 60 arm bands and bracelets, and wearing HUGE black pants with a bunch of metal rings thinking that Hot Topic (Poseur/Mallcunt Central) is \\"The place to be.\\"Well, let me tell you kids, you know nothing about metal. Seriously, if you think this is heavy, go get a damn Cryptopsy or Napalm Death's new record and you'll realize that this is pure gayness. Total nutsuckage is found right here. And why is Corey Taylor praised so much as a singer? (Whorey Gaylor more like it.) Mike Patton could beat him in his sleep. and Joey Jordison couldn't be half of Pete Sandoval or Gene Hoglan. If you'd get rid of about 33 members, then you'll have potential to be an actual death metal band. But, Slipknot is breaking up soon. Yup, getting the boot by Sellrunner Records, and thank God. It's about time.
0930289455|4.0|This is a tragic story of showing how people are...well...different. The story is decent, art is great. BUT BE WARNED this book has some very scary looking people and they are compared to \\"The Average Man\\".It also tells the tragic story of jokers never before seen origin. The story is 3 1/2  star. Butthe ending fight is fanaminal. So it's worth buying. (If your a fan of batman).<br /> Not suitable for younger children.
6304994540|5.0|The Big Lebowski, without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made.  Jeff Bridges plays the shaggy-faced, pacifistic deadbeat Jeffrey Lebowski (Known to everyone as \\"The Dude\\"), who gets his nutrition from White Russians made with Half & Half and gets his excercize from bowling with his friends.  His best friend, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman in his best comic role), is a rage-prone Jewish intellectual wannabe who can't get over his Vietnam days.  Steve Buscemi plays The Dude's other friend, Donny, who can't get a word in edgewise because Walter constantly rebukes him (SHUT THE ... UP, DONNY!!!)  John Tuturro plays a perverted Latino bowler and Ben Gazarra plays a pornographer.  All of this is wrapped up in a strange story about mistaken identity.  This is a great movie.
B000069HK2|5.0|This cd is phenomenal. ill be honest, when I bought it i wasnt that into it, but after awhile it grew on me. Bullimic is one of the best songs ever! and maybe memories is perfect. I saw them live in Pittsburgh and got to meet them and they are the coolest friggin guys in the world. They will chill with you all night. Thats rock and roll right there. buy this cd, you will not regret it.
0783229526|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. It's one of a kind. The acting-job is handled very nicely Johnny &amp; Benficio. It really captures the pictures you get in your head when reading the book. <br />Allthough the book is far more deeper and better than the movie, I truely can recommend watching it! After that read the book.<br />All hail HST and the other weirdos keeping it real.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Among the hundreds of rap/electrical/undefined female musicians tha came out last 10 years or so I had lost my faith in hearing again a good-old pop/rock singer hit the waves... Well, meet PINK. It's music, although commercial to the bone, is as close as you can get to 80's and early 90's well concived and well executed albums destined to entretain people. Almost all songs in this album do that. It's a pleasure to hear a voice so matched with the back sounds of guitars and drums. She really seems to enjoy singing and that joy is passed to us, listeners.
0380002930|5.0|I first read this book when I was a junior in High School. I automatically loved it! I'm now in college, and it still remains my favorite story of all time, no matter how many new books I read! It's beautifully written, constantly entertaining, and is one of the few true page-turners. You will not get bored with this book. Without a doubt, it makes the list of things you should read during your lifetime.
B00005JLSC|5.0|We just don't get enough musicals these days. And seeing the musical talent unexpectedly possessed by Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere. Who knew that these guys had this degree of talent? I have been a big Renee Zellweger fan ever since I first saw her in JERRY MAGUIRE, and for me she just hasn't been in enough films, but not in a million years would I have guessed that she could have danced and sung as well as she did in this film. I had read somewhere that Catherine Zeta-Jones was an accomplished singer, and I knew she was a trained gymnast, so her performance wasn't as surprising, though I am delighted she was given a chance. And what a shock to see Richard Gere sing and dance! I have since learned that he starred in a production of GREASE onstage before making the transition to film, but he seemed so at ease doing both you are surprised he hasn't done it in film before (though he did play the piano in a famous scene in PRETTY WOMAN). Not wanting anyone to think that a modern day Marni Nixon (the marvelous singer who did the singing for Natalie Wood in WEST SIDE STORY and Audrey Hepburn in MY FAIR LADY) was hiding in the wings, near the end of the closing credits are large declarations that the three principals did all their own singing and dancing.<br />The three principals along with Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly are primarily responsible for one aspect of the success of this film. There are two others that I would single out. First, all those responsible for art design, set design, and clothing design. Second, those responsible for all aspects of the music and choreography. All the songs are innovative and brilliant, and they are all exquisitely performed.<br />This film will probably win a bucket full of Oscars, but I hope that Best Director is not one of them. The film does possess one flaw, and one that puts the lie to the oft repeated claim that this film resurrects the musical of old. It does not. Why? Those making the older musicals, beginning with Busby Berkeley and extending on through Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly to the WEST SIDE STORY understood an important principal: busy actors, static camera. CHICAGO instead employs busy actors/dancers and an equally busy camera. Instead of long, static shots with few cuts, there was a directorial and editing decision to make dozens of shots. The camera at times is just out of control, which makes some numbers a tad difficult to follow. Was this done to cover up that the dancers were sometimes not completely professional? I don't think so. I think it was done for artistic reasons. It is not surprising that some of the best moments in the film were those when the camera did become stationary and shot the numbers in long shots, like Roxie Hart's wonderful \\"Nowadays,\\" the musical numbers actually become more compelling.<br />Many of the first films made at the advent of the talking era in motion pictures were musicals, and they were mainstays of cinema until the sixties. I hoped a couple of years ago that the brilliance of MOULIN ROUGE would inspire more studios to produced new musicals, and perhaps it made the making of CHICAGO more possible. I hope both films signal the beginning of the reemergence of film musical. We obviously have a lot of talent, and the lack of vehicles has meant that some of today's most talented individuals-the prodigiously gifted Mandy Patinkin springs to mind (many know him from THE PRINCESS BRIDE or ER, but are unaware that he may be the premiere performer of his generation on the musical stage)-have never been able to put that talent on display in film. Hopefully this is beginning to change.sicals, beginning with Busby Berkeley and extending on through Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly to the WEST SIDE STORY understood an important principal: busy actors, static camera.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Listening to her, you immediately become aware of the soft smoothness of her voice, and the effortless, sultry ways in which she weaves the melodies of her songs.  Some she sings in that unhurried way of a Billie Holiday, mixed with that smoothe jazzy style of a Diana Krall. A little bit of Macy Gray (without the edge) comes through as well, but make no mistake, EVERYTHING is Norah Jones. In other words, this young woman has all the qualities of some of music's best female vocal artists in the type of songs she sings.<br />Her songs carry the full range of a little Country, Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, and lullabies (if you doubt me, just listen to her \\"I've Got To See You Again\\"). They are pure comfort and relaxation; the kind you feel good to just let wash away the hustle and bustle of a hectic day. The kind your soul seeks out for calm. The alternative to headache medicine.<br />Although her songs can be listened to for the sheer joy and pleasure of them, they could also serve as background music that speaks peacefully and non-threateningly to your surroundings, and you'll know they will have started working their MAGIC on you, when unconsciously you find yourself singing or humming their melodies. Bobbing and swaying your head slightly is also confirmation.<br />Babies, likewise,  will find it easy to fall asleep from the gentle and soothing sound of her voice. It'll be a natural lullaby for them.<br />Considering this artist is only in her early twenties, and has already made her singing debut with such a positive and graceful entrance, she has only given us a lovable sample of what's to come.  Like a good wine, she will only get BETTER as she matures!!!
B000001FA4|5.0|This album simply gets better over time. It doesn't have War's aggression or The Joshua Tree's openness, but those records were more structured and hook-laden. TUF has an emotional depth that has never been reached by the band since. The production is muted and ethereal, the Edge's guitar is hypnotic, and Bono's singing ranges from a junkie's mumble to painful confessional.  But what really makes this record brilliant is not the music itself but what the music will reveal about you, the listener. Put it on when you need grounding, when you're empty, when you're excited and about to embark on a big adventure, when you question the world and your life, when you're about to make or have made a big decision.  Sit quietly and listen to \\"Elvis Presley and America.\\" It's sadness and beauty is almost overwhelming.

B00006AUIG|5.0|Session 9 is a smart, dark, chilling feature compared to the otherwise torturous banality found in most horror/thriller films.<BR>To begin, it has a unique plot line; it's a film about an asbestos clean-up crew hired to remove the substance from an abandoned asylum. That is cool enough to get my attention. How many films have you seen about asbestos workers? But it gets better...<BR>The crew has it's various characters, all a bit extreme in one way or another: the mid-life crisis, the dense teenager, the jealous ex-boyfriend...and a few others. These characters set up the tension of the film at the start. You can see they each have some form of conflict and anguish going on in their lives at the start. Which causes them to be a little bit on edge. On top of that, they have to work around this intensely hazardous material on a daily basis. And still further, their current hire is to work in the creepiest place you can think of.The abandoned insane aysylum. It only gets creepier from there.<br />It's full of surprises,and INCREDIBLE cinematogrpahy.It' just a pleasure to absorb using all your senses.<br />The actual location was an old insane asylum. No sets were used. And that is half of what makes the movie as great as it is. If you are fortunate enough to watch the DVD version with all the extras such as commentary, and featurettes, you will learn that the actual location had a serious effect on the actors while they were there. The more you listen to their actual experiences the more the film takes on a new light and may very well make you watch it again with a different perspective. You begin to realise that a lot of the actors didn't have to do much \\"acting\\" when they were supposed to be frightened in their scenes and that has such an amazing effect on the film. I found it to be so much more entertaining to watch a film where the actors were just as creeped out as the audience. That gave it a realism most films will never have. It's over-all just the most pleasure you can derive from being freaked out!

Her voice is So beautiful and unique, bluesy, jazzy, soulful, it just gives ya the chills! Her Very Handsome Band's dynamic musicianship is brilliant. As for the DVD, the production is perfect, outstanding Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, crisp & clear!! Very colorful video and well shot camera angles and mixes! 9 of 15 tracks performed are from the 'Come Away With Me' CD. If this performance is any indication, Norah has quite a bright and hopeful future ahead of her!!!!

This is a good up and comming band and with Dave Grohl drumming your going to have a great band for years to come.  The best song would be No one Knows, I know I know the radio is playing the [air] out of it but its still good to hear.  If you like Nirvana and Foo Fighters I would recomend this

B000068TPN|5.0|This DVD has the usual guts, guns and glory adventure that will please most males.  It also has the gut wrenching, scenes that show what happens at home after men die doing their job.  This will bring the females in.<br />I liked this movie because 1) I had read the book and, 2) I am a Vietnam Veteran.  I was a crewman on a helicopter like the one you will see inserting the troops, supplies, bullets, and removing the wounded and dead.  I liked this movie because, while it was about the First Cav, it was also about how the war was fought by use of helicopters when I was there.<br />This story is about the first time the North Vietnamise Army stood and fought with the Americans.  This is a story about how American forces - who were vastly outnumbered - were able to fight back again and again while doing what we do best.  Utilizing the best equipment in the world to cause much pain and suffering on the choosen enemy.<br />This story is also about the first major use of helicopters in battle against a strong, well dug in enemy force.  After the first group of troops were inserted, ground fire was intense.  The brave sky soliders kept comming back, by day and night, until the enemy withdrew and would fight no more.    When you see this movie, try to watch for and remember what the aircrew were doing and remember that each of us were there because we wanted to be.  No one can force anyone to fly.  You do it because you love to do it.
B00006CXGH|5.0|This movie is great, in my opinion any River Phoenix movie is great. And if you are a tru fan of River Phoenix than any movie with him is worth seeing and as for wasting his talents... he wasted his talent just being in this world with us no one could ever completely understand how deep his talents were. River will alwayz be loved and missed. Now if you are truly a River fan then I defintly recommend this movie to you.
B00006J9OT|4.0|This disc is copy protected.....you will not be able to rip a backup copy.  The copy protection is not labeled on the package.  Really a shame, I will never again purchase music from the Universal group, had the copy protection been disclosed I would not have a problem with it.  The copy protection utilized to protect this disc definitely degrades the overall sound quality. I feel really sorry for Ms Krall, for this could have been a stunning recording (mastered by Doug Sax)that was butchered by the copy protection (massive insertion of digital artifacts that produce read errors).
6305907145|1.0|As an enormous fan of Jane Austen, Mansfield Park is one of my favorite books. The emphasis on integrity in the book and it's innocence is completely destroyed by vile additions in this movie. How can anyone be so egotistical to think they could improve on a Jane Austin story by adding \\"politically correct\\" modern elements never even hinted at in the origional story? Jane would roll over in her grave to see the shocking, in your face sexuality gratuitiously added to her beautiful love story. I enjoy Jane Austin so much mainly because I don't have to worry that my senses will be asaulted by the kind of immorality Hollywood loves to depict so graphically. Shame on the makers of this film.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord of the Rings: Two Towers is certainly much better than 2002's other sequels.  Attack of the Clones had some good character development, but lack of good screenplay and overabundance of special effects.  Chamber of Secrets had just enough special effects and a not so bad screenplay, but lack of character development.  Two Towers has just enough of everything and a good screenplay.<BR> There were several things I liked in particular about TT.  I really liked Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, they put such emotion and presence into their roles as possible and greatly improved my opinion of them.  All the other actors did a good job too, especially John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, and Brad Dourif as Wormtongue.  <BR> Secondly, the special effects, which perhaps barely outranked those of FOTR.  The beginning fight with the Balrog, the cool Ents (especially at the end, when poor Saruman met his match: kung-fu trees), the Wargs battle (though added scene was well-done) and the Wraiths on Wings were very good.  And of course the brilliant Andy Serkis doing the movements and excellent voice for an equally brilliant CG Gollum.  He was robbed an Oscar nomination.  Helm's Deep was a really cool battle scene too.<BR> Now for the complaints:  what in the world was up with Faramir?  While I understand the reason for changing his character according to the words of Galadriel, I was still upset with them.  I always admired the nobility in Faramir of the books, but they've gone and ruined that.  The exorcism of Theoden wasn't as bad as I heard, but it was still a little weird.  The scenes of Arwen and Elrond always made be uncomfortable, because Arwen wasn't supposed to be there and Elrond was too un-elven.<BR> But in general, the movie is really cool and the music is excellent.  Go and see it, but make sure you saw the first movie first.
B000066JES|4.0|dude...who knew fabio was such a [great] bassist?!?!? and the harp totally rocks...they can break it down like no other has been 80's metal band. hats off manowar for sounding like the 80's for 20 years. brothers everywhere, raise your fists into the air!!!!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I like this CD it is good. I think the editor's review was a little biased, he needs to lighten up.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I'm no grandma, but after enduring the scream-fest that was the 90's I am a little weary of \\"angry\\" singers. (Sorry, Alanis, I love ya but you sound a little bitter and whiny as I stare down the barrel of age 30). Norah's voice sounds wise, sexy and girlish all at once and her album is a jewel of lush simplicity. The second track, the name of which escapes me, is almost eerie in that Norah might as well have been peeking in my childhood bedroom as I contentedly listened to my favorite song over and over. (It was \\"Hey Jude\\", if anyone wonders.) Her original lyrics are thoughtful and certainly much more impressive than the junk that the Britney clones are screeching out these days. I also appreciate her seeming lack of desire to waggle her belly button in our faces at all times, though I'm sure it's lovely. Congrats on the Grammys, Miss Jones! Give yourself a gift, folks --buy this album.
B000088E6D|5.0|Absolutely a great CD from beginning to end. Listen to it on a romantic evening for two with a bottle of wine, or alone with a cup of tea.  Either way it is truly one the best CDs in my collection now. Shucks, I especially love dancing around in my living room to it. Who knew I could rumba? You will too when you listen to Sway and swinging version of The Way You Look Tonight.  Excellent production,  obviously...can't do wrong when you have David Foster & Humberto Gatica in your corner. Hope we get more from this young man. He and Norah Jones prove there is still hope for the sake of good music. Enjoy!!!

B000002UEB|1.0|If you love music with every ounce of joy and emotion wrung out of it, then this record is for you.  This is a perfect example of a band that takes themselves far too seriously.  Queensryche is obviously inspired by Pink Floyd, but everything that makes Pink Floyd great (good taste, humor, originality, pop sensibility) is totally lacking in this record.  OK, I will concede that if you are a Metal junkie who likes theme-albums for their own sake and musicians with good chops that like to show off (for the sake of showing off) then this is a must-listen.  I had a neighbor that thought this was the greatest album ever.  He once said to me, &quot;Music isn't supposed to be FUN; music is supposed to be SERIOUS!&quot;  I guess you are pathologically impaired from enjoying music, then you won't mind listening to music that brings no enjoyment to the listener.  But, on another level, this music can be enjoyed.  That is, for the sheer hilarity of the stupid, over-bearing story that goes with the songs.
B00006YXEK|5.0|George's son Dhani plays a big role in making this final album of his father's possible (he contributes vocals and electric and acoustic guitar) as does ELO mastermind Jeff Lynne.  There are no liner notes as to when each individual track was recorded but they all run cohesively. \\"Vatican Blues\\" sounds like it could've been recorded with the Travelling Wilburys (incidentally, George was raised Catholic). \\"Pisces Fish\\" talks about the environment. \\"Any Road\\" opens up the CD and features George's trademarked wry humour as well as a jaunty ukelele intro. \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" was probably recorded around the time of his early 1990's tour with Eric Clapton. \\"Marwa Blues\\" is a charming instrumental, featuring a melancholy slide guitar by George.  \\"Never Get Over You\\" is a charming love song and \\"Rocking Chair\\" is a fun song. \\"Brainwashed\\" closes this CD and is one of the most spiritual songs, with the catchy \\"God, God, God\\" chorus. <br />The extra's are nice (I got this edition for collector's sake) with a mini poster, a Dark Horse sticker an autographed guitar pick and a 7 minute DVD. I would've liked more time on the DVD but it does show how hard Dhani worked in the production of the CD. As for the CD, it's listenable all the way through and should prove to fans how talented George really was and how much talent Dhani Harrison has developed.

B00008BLB8|5.0|Stuck between two pop sounding,light weight studio recordings,<br />Caught In The Act stands out as one of the best hard rock<br />recordings of it's time. Even the more pop sounding songs on<br />this live act are done with a hard edge that blows the studio<br />versions out of the water! And the bass,Schacher is at his<br />best. Farner's vocals are a stand out, more refined, yet just<br />as, if not more powerful than on their first live recording.<br />  It's hard to pick a favorite here,but if I was pressed I'd<br />have to say The Railroad stands out with it's great vocals,<br />and excellent guitar work. As always, Frost's keyboard<br />work is outstanding through out,and Brewer's drum solo has<br />been restored. Technical problems from the vinyl release,<br />as well as earlier c.d. releases have been corrected,giving<br />this version a smoother, more natural sound.<br />  Enjoy!!!
B00006J3WH|5.0|After seeing the amazing Buffy musical, I wanted a CD to come out with the songs.  They were amazing, funny, and touching.  You can tell how much work was put into these songs and storylines on the show.  Granted, having seen the episode many times, it makes the soundtrack more understandable and great, but even if you aren't obsessed with it as I am, in side the CD cover, Joss Whedon gives an overview of what had happened that season so far.  My favorite songs on this CD are Rest in Peace, Under Your Spell, and Under Your Spell/Standing.
B00006690G|3.0|I love Eminem for his fearless right-attacha lyrics and song messages.  He's not afraid of telling it like it is.  This album is full of more controversial subjects that he isn't afraid of attacking head-on.  Unfortunately, he has to swear/curse every other word. By doing this he, for the most part, limits his listening audience's age, where his songs can be played (have a little decency), and who's going to buy his cd's (Parental Advisory Warning).  <br />I bought this album realizing that there may be a few swear words (parental advisory label).  But I was absolutely disgusted with his language!  There's one song in particular, I don't even remember which one it is because I have hardly listened to the album after I found this song, that is completely derogitory towards women. In fact I'm going to take my cd in to a local music store and trade it off for that very reason! <br />I bought the album for \\"Without Me\\" after I heard it on the radio.  I really liked the song because it was catchy.  I bought this cd and the cd version of \\"Without Me\\" is different.  Lots of foul language is used.  I live in a neighborhood full of little kids, I can't play this/enjoy this in public!<br />It's too bad - I believe more people would listen to Eminem and take him and his music more serious if he would take himself more serious as well!
078062999X|5.0|Part of the genius of Branagh's interpretation of Hamlet is in the use of the techniques of the cinema to enhance the production.  Branagh has not condensed the acts like some mass market soup, as was done in Olivier's 1948 Oscar-winning production, or in, say, Zeffirelli's 1989 Hamlet lite starring Mel Gibson (both excellent, though, within their scope), but has kept every word while directing our understanding so that even those only casually familiar with the play might follow the intent and purpose with discernment.  Recall that for Shakespeare--the ultimate actor's playwright who wrote with precious few stage directions--interpretation was left to the direction and the actors, an open invitation that Branagh rightly accepts.<br /><br />The use of flashback scenes of things implied, such as the amorous union of Ophelia and her Lord Hamlet abed, or of a vast expanse of snow darkened with distant soldiers to represent the threat of Fortinbras' army from without, and especially the vivid remembrance in the mind's eye of the new king's dastardly deed of murder most foul, helps us all to more keenly appreciate just what it is that torments Hamlet's soul.  I also liked the intense closeups.  How they would have bemused and delighted an Elizabethan audience.<br /><br />Branagh's ambitious Hamlet is also one of the most accessible and entertaining, yet without the faintest hint of any dumbing down or abbreviation.  A play is to divert, to entertain, to allow us to identify with others whose trials and tribulations are so like our own.  And so first the playwright seeks to engage his audience, and only then, by happenstance and indirection, to inspire and to inform.  Shakespeare did this unconsciously, we might say.  He wrote for the popular audience of his time, a broad audience, it should be noted, that included kings and queens as well as knaves and beggars, and he reached them, one and all.  We are much removed from those times, and yet, this play, this singular achievement in theatre, still has the power to transcend mere entertainment, to fuse poetry and story, as well as the high and the low, and speak once again to a new audience twenty generations removed.<br /><br />Branagh himself is a wonderful Hamlet, perhaps a bit of a ham at times (as I think was Shakespeare's intent), a prince who is the friend of itinerant players.  He also lacks somewhat in stature (as we conceive our great heroes); nonetheless his interpretation of the great prince's torment and his singular obsession to avenge his father's murder speaks strongly to us all.  Branagh, more than any other Hamlet, makes us understand the distracted, anguished and tortured prince, and guides us to not only an appreciation of his actions, wild and crazy as they sometimes are, but to an identification and an understanding of why (the eternal query) Hamlet is so long in assuming the name of action.  In Branagh's production, this old quibble with Hamlet's character dissolves itself into a dew, and we realize that he was acting strongly, purposely all the while.  He had to know the truth without doubt so that he might act in concert with it.<br /><br />I was also very much impressed with Derek Jacobi's Claudius.  One recalls that Jacobi played Hamlet in the only other full cinematic production of the play that I know of, produced in 1980 by the BBC with Claire Bloom as Gertrude; and he was an excellent Hamlet, although perhaps like Branagh something less than a massive presence.  His Claudius combines second son ambition with a Machiavellian heart, whose words go up but whose thoughts remind below, as is the way of villains everywhere.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is a remarkable Ophelia, lending an unusual strength to the role (strength of character is part of what Kate Winslet brings to any role), but with the poor, sweet girl's vulnerability intact.  She does the mad scene with Claudius as well as I have seen it done, and of course her personal charisma and beauty embellishes the production.<br /><br />Richard Briers as Polonius, proves that that officious fool is indeed that, and yet something more so that we can see why he was a counselor to the king.  The famous speech he gives to Laertes as his son departs for France, is really ancient wisdom even though it comes from a fool.<br /><br />Julie Christie was a delight as the besmirched and wretched queen.  In the bedroom scene with Hamlet she becomes transparent to not only her son, but to us all, and we feel that the camera is reaching into her soul.  She is outstanding.<br /><br />The bit players had their time upon the stage and did middling well to very good.  I liked Charlton Heston's player king (although I think he and John Gielgud might have switched roles to good effect) and Billy Crystal's gravedigger was finely etched.  Only Jack Lemon's Marcellus really disappointed, but I think that was mainly because he was so poorly cast in such a role.  Not once was he able to flash the Jack Lemon grin that we have come to know so well.<br /><br />The idea of doing a Shakespearean play with nineteenth century dress in the late twentieth century worked wonderfully well, but I know not why.  Perhaps the place and dress are just enough removed from our lives that they are somewhat strange but recognizable in a pleasing way.  And perhaps it is just another tribute to the timeless nature of Shakespeare's play.  The mirrors in the great hall added to the effect of a vast and indifferent castle environment, and in the scene with Ophelia and Laertes returned tended to magnify the focus.<br /><br />There is so much more to say about this wonderful cinematic production.  It is, all things considered, one of  the best Hamlets ever done.  Perhaps it is the best.  See it, by all means, see it for yourself.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\"es the production.<br /><br />Richard Briers as Polonius, proves that that officious fool is indeed that, and yet something more so that we can see why he was a counselor to the king.

B000088E6D|1.0|Maybe I am missing something because I didn't see Buble live on The Today Show, but I don't understand the excitement about this CD. The orchestra arrangements are tinny, the vocals sometimes sound off-key and unimpressive to me, and the artist's scatting is actually quite jarring.  The CD sounds like it was thrown together at the last minute rather than meticulously crafted, which is a shock to me considering the high quality David Foster usually gives us. For a better big-band/return to swing album, spend the extra dough and get the import of Robbie William's \\"Swing When You're Winning\\" with its accompanying domestically available DVD.
B00000I2UC|5.0|Back in 1989 this CD was way ahead of it's time.  Gone are the overdone feedback of their earlier CD's and replaced it with more polish and easier to digest guitars.  I like some of their earlier work, but Automatic is the total package.  This was one of the first successful guitar heavy alternative bands along with the Pixies and both bands are still better than most stuff you will hear today.  Probably the best aspect of this disc is it's uniqueness, I really can't find any bands that have their sound.  Probably the best comparison might be early Catherine Wheel, their CD Ferment comes close.
B0000041A9|5.0|I already owned the famous Ashkenazy/Harrell set from Decca for a long time. One day I decided to try this out. It's stunning. While Ashkenazy is more forceful, Richter is lighter and more lyrical, and faster too. This recording is also clearer than the Ashkenazy set. What to say? Both are 5 stars. I think this set is a shade better than Ashkenazy's set. Buy both if you can. If not, buy this set as the playing is not only a shade better but you get 3 bonus fill-ups in the form of 3 sets of variations written by Beethoven.
B00005YW4H|1.0|If Kenny G. were a female vocalist, his songs would sound like this.
078322947X|5.0|Yes, 5 stars is for the film itself. It is arguably THE MOST nerve-wracking cinematic experience ever filmed. Now with that said, here is the proof that \\"Sorcerer\\" was shot in widescreen:    1. Look at the picture of all five men on the back of the DVD cover. You can see only a trim of the German's face on the right side, and the man to the far left side has his head in full view. Now watch that sequence on this full-frame DVD and you cannot see the German at all, and you can only see half of the man's head on the left. Then after the man tells the others that they leave in four hours, it cuts back to them again, AND YOU CANNOT SEE THE MAN ON THE LEFT SIDE ANYMORE, AND THE GERMAN MAN IS IN FULL VIEW.    2. When you watch the original theatrical trailer, there is a shot from the sequence when the hitman and Domiguez are being questioned about the contents of their truck at gunpoint by a terrorist group. When the two first see the group, there is a shot where you see three men pointing automatic guns at the screen. BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONLY SEEN AS TWO MEN IN THE FULL-FRAME FILM. THE MAN YOU SEE TO THE RIGHT IN THE THEATRICAL TRAILER IS CUT OFF.    3. Supposedly, there was a Laserdisc version of \\"Sorcerer\\" presented in it's original 1.66:1 ratio.    So please, don't gimmie any bull about this film being shot in full-frame. Friedkin may have his wishes to keep this movie in a 1.33:1 ratio, but I say that Universal Pictures is just being lazy in keeping the movie this way.    \\"Ask Jon Mulvaney\\" at Criterion Collection and let's get a proper treatment for this film!
B00004Z459|4.0|This is an exellent cd.the way the rapper and singer/yeller switch around is exciting.the guitars on this album arnt special but not bad.{i think they will be better on meteora since on that they have pheonix the bassist.the drums r kinda hard to hear but not bad either.the sampler makes each song unique and dark.now i know linkin park is not as good as earleir bands such as metallica ac/dc aerosmith or many others.i have metallica and ac/dc albums and i must say if u want the best music can offer get them.but this is a good band for today.sure the singer somtimes sounds kinda poppy but its only in crawling and pusing me away yet it sounds good adn he can take his vocal abillities far from pop normal scream and scream/sing typish.my favs r papercut and one step closer[both probaly the best guitar traks],crawling in the end and runaway but i like all the songs.this is not metal yet it is rap rock with a good message powerful.now also on their new album meteora not yet realeased i heard somwhere i belong.it starts with weird samples acoustic guitar and then goes into a very good guitar part and mike does a powerful rap song and chester in the chorus screams'i wanna heal i wanna feel wat i thought was never real i i wanna get wat i wanted all along somwhere i belong.to tell u the truth that is the only song i hav heard off meteora and that is better then all the songs on hybrid theryy except for in the end.this is worth a buy pik it up.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Sad, because the film has some good ideas and camerawork, but it all adds up to horrible, pretentious arthouse dogdoo. Ellen Burstyn is remarkable as always, and in fact, the acting is not really to be faulted on any count. But this is just another glorification of violence, cheap sex and drugs (and hey-- I like all those things, but I like there to be a justification for their existence in a movie...)that ends up in a big messpile that just left me hollow and feeling dismal. Neither fun nor serious, just pretentious and silly. Don't give this movie two hours of your life. It won't give you anything back and you'll never recover the wasted time.
0316666343|3.0|This book could have ben much better if the author thinned out the line-up of characters.  I kept having to refer back to figure out who was who.  But most of all, the story lost its punch, and ultimiately its grip on me.  The most important characters (minus the protagonist) just fade away and there is no resolution.
0064407667|5.0|...to be able to read these delightful books! Though I was a bit apprehensive at first, reading the Unfortunate Events series has proved to be a truly entertaining adventure. The books are extremely clever, witty and fun, despite their somewhat unhappy subject matter. They succeed in being cute without crossing over to sappiness. I don't find the stories depressing, and though you do pity the Baudelaires, it's fun to side with them and find out what mess they'll next be presented with. I also think they make you examine and feel better about your own life, because no matter how awful your life may seem at times, it cannot be as bad as the life of a Baudelaire sibling!
B000002MP2|5.0|This is the album that really made punk mainstream in the 90s, though I personally consider this 'rock' and not 'punk.' Green Day's infectious blend of punk, rock and pop added a more uptempo atmosphere to the dreary rock of grunge, but Billie Joe's lyrics still contained a sense of apathy and hopelessness that kids can easily relate to.<BR><BR>Dookie has 14 songs on it, all of them brief but excellent. In addition to being energetic, Green Day is also really good at their instruments, especially Mike Dirnt being one of the best bassists of the 90s. The band has an excellent chemistry together, and it has only solidified since Dookie, but this album was their first album to be truly considered amazing and almost perfect. The songs are consistently crafted, and catchy, it's almost impossible to dislike. In fact, the only people who really dislike this album are those uneducated punk'purists' who hate Green Day for the mere fact that they signed to a major label. Whether this was released on a major label or an indie label, it would still be a great album, and probably would be seen as one of the best albums of the 90s either way.<BR><BR>If it weren't for this album, most of these pop punk bands you hear now would have no chance of breaking through to the mainstream or have their mediocrity infiltrate the minds of America's youth. Thanks to Dookie's indeniable impact, 'punk,' or what'sleftof it, is a dominant force in music. Unfortunately, no one has since topped the power, the energy, or the excellence of Dookie. Best songs: Burnout, Chump, Longview, Basket Case, FOD
B00003CY6M|3.0|On the surface, \\"Serendipity\\" could be seen as another formulaic fate movie. Not quite. Whilst it tends to stick to the usual, fairly predictable style of that genre, there are differences for those who want to look further. It is not an intellectual movie: neither is it air-headed and whilst it is a little contrived, it remains, nonetheless, a pleasing and enjoyable little romantic comedy.<br />Previous examples of this genre have included some very poorly constructed films such as \\"Only You\\" and \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\". The underlying philosophy of those films was that everything is planned and there's nothing you can do about anything. Fate will look after you; you just have to believe in it. Yeah, right...This is where \\"Serendipity\\" departs from the norm.<br />Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdale's Department Store a few days before Christmas and share an eight hour romantic interlude they will never forget. Both characters have partners so Sara decides to leave eveything to chance and sends her name and phone number out into the world inside a book which she sells the following day. Jonathan writes his name on a $... note which Sara immediately spends, thus sending his details into the universe. The idea being that if these items find their way into the other person's hand, they can pick up where the evening left off.<br />Seven years later, when both are engaged to be married to different partners, the worm starts to turn. Sara, after being confronted with a reminder of the night and accompanied by her friend Eve (Molly Shannon), makes her way to New York to find Jonathan while Jonathan, having been subjected to similar cues and accompanied by his friend Dean (Jeremy Piven), goes in search of Sara. The plot line is fairly predictable and one can fairly easily guess the rest.<br />What separates this one from the rest is the alternative plot. Both Eve and Dean provide a genuine reality check. Eve's line \\"Life's a mess, Sara. It's chaos personified\\", is one of the best ripostes I've heard in a romantic comedy and fits beautifully. Dean gives the extra impetus to Jonathan and resolves some of his own problems at the same time.<br />Despite the one-sided, romantic publicity angle on which the film was promoted, \\"Serendipity\\" offers a balance between the romantic and the realistic. Not a bad way of looking at life. In fact it is a far better movie for it. Ultimately. in this film, the romantic angle has to win but at least it doesn't attempt to jam air-headed, half-baked, irresponsible pseudo-philosophy down the viewer's throat (I have resolved never to see another Meg Ryan movie as long as I live).<br />The acting performances are for the most part, up to scratch. John Cusack is always pretty solid and Jeremy Piven, Molly Shannon, Bridget Moynahan and John Corbett do their bit; especially Shannon and Piven. Strangely, Kate Beckinsale is rather patchy and it is not one of her better performances. In some scenes she's great whilst in others she's pretty ordinary. She has done better. Eugene Levy is just perfect as the grouchy shop assistant and serves up more laughs than anyone else.<br />All in all, it doesn't quite measure up to my favourite romantic comedy: \\"Before Sunrise\\" but it has many merits. To be honest, I couldn't decide whether to give it three stars or four. In the end I decided it was a genuine three stars but not quite genuine at four. As one who has been lucky enough to experience a similar situation, with all its bizarre twists, I recommend it.
0782008119|5.0|This film is amazing beyond words. It gives all of the infomration one would need about the greatest musical scene of the 90stold by the artists/producers/record company CEOs themselves. A lot of the people interviewed were humorous, others very serious, but either way it was a really candid interview.<BR><BR>It gives insight to the origin of grunge around 1984 or 1985 with bandslike Green River and the U-Men, to the fomration of its core bands like Soundgraden and Alice In Chains, the grunge explosion of the early 90s, and its demise with the death of Kurt Cobain and the fall of other great Seattle bands.<BR><BR>In addition to excellent interviews, and some great live performances, it has the very first performance of Nirvana's classic song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" about 100 tiumes more raw and abrasive than the version on Nevermind.
B00006LPIW|4.0|The boundaries of love and despair have possibly never been granted so desperate a stage as the slowly weakening lines on the ever-beautiful face of Isabelle Huppert in THE PIANO TEACHER.<br />Erika (Huppert) is a middle-aged piano teacher who spends her existence vascillating between torturous control over the lives of child geniuses and the smothering watchfulness of an aging, dispassionate mother.  However, when a young piano-playing engineer (Benoit Magimel) enters her life with his young mind on his lusty attraction, Erika's life begins to unravel.  Trying to maintain control, she continues to seek ways to express her innermost feelings without surrendering to the power of emotion -- having been trapped in an emotionless existence for so long.  Eventually, she cracks under the stress of her two worlds colliding, with equal parts psychological danger and the allure of eroticism.<br />Two haunting performances (Huppert and Magimel) make this story as captivating as it is disturbing.  In the end, both characters are forever changed, unable to return to the solace of the world they knew before and unwilling to sacrifice their outer shells for inner peace.<br />Not for the squeamish, THE PIANO TEACHER is highly recommended.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I couldn't wait for this CD, and almost broke my back on my way to getting it-and it was worth it!  It stands up to repeated listens and CZJ is just AMAZING with her interpretations of All That Jazz &amp; Class, Mr. Cellophane is a stand-out as one of Kander &amp; Ebb's best songs ever and Queen Latifa's When You're Good To Mama is phenominal!  My only complaint are the songs they didn't put into the film, that are key to character development-like My Own Best Friend ect...but still!  BUY THIS CD!
0767830555|5.0|This movie is truely one of the greatest films of all time. Taxi Driver is surely De Niros greatest. Martin Scorsese is an absolute genious. I reccomend tis movie to everyone.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Like the title says, Ms. Aguilera has stripped herself of all her superfluous garb to produce a very intimate and revealing album.  Unlike her flashy \\"Dirrty\\" track, many of the songs in this album are very powerful and cover a wide range of topics from self-esteem (\\"Beautiful\\") to family abuse (\\"I'm OK\\").  Her lyrics are liberating and self-asserting - something our youth could really use now-a-days.  On top of that, the music to the lyrics ranges from slow melodies, to latin flavor, to heavy pop and jazz.  By far, her best album!
6301966562|5.0|I first saw this flim at the cinema in 84 and absolutly adored this tale of a rather odd love triangle. The story revolves around Miles (rather Geeky chap who designes earthquake proof buildings) Edgar, who is Miles new computer who accidently comes alive after Miles spills champagne over it, and Madline, his beautifull neighbour who is a chellist. I wont go into much detail about the story as some of the other reviews have done this wonderfully, but I do have to mention the movies excellant sound track. The music sounds quite dated now but still sends my feet tapping! Artists include P.P. Arnold, Jeff Lynne (E.L.O.), Boy George and others.<BR>On a down side I do find it such a shame that this wonderfull film is not available in the UK or even in the USA on DVD (YET! Fingers crossed.) I don`t know why this is as it is not an old film and was very popular hear when it was first released. Also it has not even been screened on TV hear, well not that I know of.<BR>Please, please, please!!!! can somebody get this film on DVD as I as well as many others would snap up this brilliant film in an instant!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|when I first heard \\"all the things she said\\", it immediately grabbed my attention. It is unique,refreshing,energetic. It sounds different from most of pops/hip pop today. <BR>So I bought the album, to my surprise, every song of it is great. You can listen to it from start to end without skipping.<BR>The vocal of the girls are strong, some times angelic,some times sexy, some times rock&roll. The music/mix is refreshing and electrifying. It is a great pop/dance rock album.<BR>I highly recommend it to everyone.
B000021XS0|5.0|OK... It's time for Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" to take a back seat to Dream Theater's \\"Scenes From a Memory\\".  Not that \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" aren't amazing CD's because they are, Scenes From a Memory is just so mush better.<BR>The low down - amazing music with great re-occuring themes, amazing mix of songs and a great story.<BR>The album progresses musically as the CD goes on with each song digging deeper and deeper into the story of Metropolis Part 2.  The surprising climax at first glance seems like the instrumental \\"Dance of Eternity\\" because the rest of the songs seem to die down after it however when you reach \\"Finally Free\\" you realize the true climax and the true plot of the story.  As the twist unfolds in \\"Finally Free\\" you can here Mike Portnoy's flawless drumming at the end which puts the cap on the greatest concept album of all time.<br />Other highlights of this album include:<BR>The amazing lyrics in Strange Deja Vu<BR>The shrink and grow solo section between John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess in Fatal Tragedy<BR>The \\"Montana\\" Zappa section in Beyond This Life<BR>If you like Metropolis Part 1 then you'll love Home<BR>The bass solo and ragtime piano section of Dance of Eternity<BR>The Roger Waters vibe of Spirit Carries On; and<BR>The genious conclusion of a complete album in Finally Free<br />Overall I think this is my favorite CD of all time and it is constantly playing in my player.  GET THE CD and you will feel the same way.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I straight out loved this movie. Mulan isn't the typical Disney sit-around-and-wait-for-fairy-godmother kinda girl. She's strong, independent, and not afraid to stand up for herself. With Eddie Murphy playing Mushu, there's some great laughs. The ancestors also crack me up. Even though I hate to admit this, some scenes with Mulan and the captain (sorry, brain freeze), made me blush! They were so adorably nervous together....Gawd, I love Disney.

B000002WUA|5.0|This album is true O.G.I would also recommend Genius/GZA's<BR>&quot;Liquid Swords&quot;.This is the album for true Hip-Hop/Wu-tang fans.
B00005JL96|5.0|What better way to let children know there is other types of music (and better in my opinion) then to bring the songs of Elvis Presley to the big screen/DVD in a great animated Disney movie!  Because of this movie, my daughter (9-1/2 years) thoroughly enjoys the music of Elvis.  She likes his songs &amp; singing but she also enjoyed hearing Wynona sing her verions of an Elvis song as well as one of the new kids &quot;pop&quot; groups sing an Elvis song.<br />The movie and characters are adorable!  There is some mild violence (thanks to Experiement 626, aka Stitch) but not enough to really warrant any concern (but this is just my opinion - others may have a different opinion).  Lilo is a lonely Hawaiian girl just trying to fit in.  Her parents are now gone and she is living with her older sister who is having difficulties keeping a job and being a guardian to Lilo.  Lilo is allowed to adopt a dog, unfortunately (or fortunate depending on your point of view) the &quot;dog&quot; she thinks she is adopting is really an alien, Experiement 626, whom she names Stitch and she instantly loves him.  Stitch is trying to hide from his creator but he was created to distroy everything.  But through all of Lilo's persistance and patience she starts to get through to Stitch and he starts to learn about family and what it means to be in a family (in the words of Lilo; &quot;Ohana means family and family means no one get's left behind.&quot;).<br />This is a must have for anyone's movie library whether it's for an adult, children or the entire family!  You can't beat the Disney magic, I grew up on Disney and feel this is one of their best!!
0060254920|1.0|we are huge book readers in our family and we find this book to be painfully poorly written- the illustrations are beautiful, but, in our opinion mr.sendak should have handed over the story writing to someone else- the story is so bland and has no direction it seems- it was almost as if he drew the pictures first and then tried to make a story of them afterwards- in fact, i am certain this is what he did- there is no story really, it makes little sense- <BR>i think he drew each picture separately and then tried to come up with a few sentences that made sense for that particular drawing and because of this, the story doesn't flow- <br />and he keeps repeating (quite annoyingly) that \\"the monsters rolled their terrrible eyes and showed their terrible teeth\\" because i think he couldn't think of anything else to say!- look, we love a variety of book styles and subjects but this one rarely gets picked off the shelf as our kids (and we) are not at all interested in it- it's one thing to have great pictures but if the story isn't there, the kids won't want to read it- this could have been a fabulous book because the illustrations are great, but unfortunately, he chose to write the story too- liken it to great actors being in a lousy movie-

B00005JKZT|3.0|I am appalled at how much Peter devieated from the book.  For starters Farimir never tried to take Frodo back to Gondor with him, as a matter of fact Farimir was nice to Frodo and did not hold him prisoner he let Frodo go with provisions to make it father along on his quest.  What was that nazgul all about (the one they met on the way back to Gondor) that never happened in the book!  Next that fight scene when Aragorn flies over the cliff, Aragorn never flew over any cliff in the book.  Third those talking tree things are Ents.  They played a bigger part in the book.  The meeting that they held was not to decide if Merry and Pippin are Hobbits, in the book they held the meeting to decide weather or not they would go to war.  And Peter left out the extra Ent charachter Quickbeam or Bregalad, with whom Merry and Pippin spent time with during the meeting.  The battle at Helms Deep was well done.  I did enjoy that even though they cut out the part where the fighting ended up in the caves and Gimli and Legolas got separated.  I would have to say they did a very good job with gollum though.  The actor deserves an award for that role.  Over all I was very disappointed that Peter deviated from the book so much.  If you haven't read the books I'm sure you where impressed and enjoyed the movie.  I however have read the books twice.  I hope he plans on redeeming himself with the third movie.
6303407188|4.0|What better man to tackle a biopic of the legendary worst director of all time Ed Wood than Tim Burton?  Master of the weird and wonderful (see Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice) Burton shows a remarkable amount of compassion, relating Burton's career up to the premiere of his fabled worst movie, Plan 9 From Outer Space.  Tracking through his relationships with his girlfriends and aging actor Bela Lugosi, there are equal parts sympathy and wonder at Wood's bizarre life, films and the band of misfits that surround him.<br />Johnny Depp is obviously at ease with director Burton, even to the extent of playing off Wood's penchant for wearing angora blouses and skirts with  panache.  His earnestness lifts the movie from what could easily have been made something far more depressing given Ed Wood's spectacular failure with regards to his career.  Martin Landau, in an Oscar-winning performance, is very impressive indeed as Bela Lugosi, playing his extreme patheticism and drug addiction in a brave and unflattering light.  The rest of the cast are good also, including the novelty of seeing Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's girlfriend.  Clearly a versatile actress she should find no problem finding work once TV's Sex And The City has finished.  Juliet Landau (Buffy The Vampire Slayer's Drusilla) puts in a good turn as one of Wood's leading actresses.<br />Whilst there are parts that drag, Burton's minute attention to detail (which never takes your attention away from the movie itself) makes it seem like you're watching a real 50's movie, especially given the mannered yet somehow realistic performances.  It might not be Burton's most accessible or even most enjoyable picture, but it stands as something of a standout in the genre of the biopic.  It's strange, magnificent, on a grand-scale, in short exactly what how you can imagine Wood wanting his life to be committed to film.
B000002I2G|1.0|I disliked this album when it came out, and I still dislike it.  Lets see how it came to pass (IMO).  The first two Door's albums  are the greatest rock albums ever recorded. Nothing before or since has ever come close.  Unfortunately, \\"Strange Days\\" did not do as well as everyone would have liked.  So, out came \\"Waiting for the Sun\\", and ...it's a hit.  Would the next album go in the direction of great songs such as \\"Five to One\\", and \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\"?  No. It went in the direction of the worst song on WFTS, \\"Winterime love\\".  Well, why not.  If yours fans prefer \\"Hello, I love you\\" to \\"People are Strange\\", then you better give them what they want, good and hard.  ... Well here it is, the Soft (and oh so sticky) Parade.  Thank God it bombed.  If it too had been a hit the wonderful, rollicking Morrison Hotel would have sounded just like so many variations of \\"Tell all the People\\". Tell all the people that you see follow me, follow me down.  ...
B000002HHB|5.0|While many groups today put all of their efforts into the one song on the album that will become the hit single, with TIGERLILY it is the album as a whole that is a masterpiece.  Each song has its own character but fits well into the consistent, mellow scheme of the album.  If you're the type who likes to pop in an album and not have to worry about programming the CD player to skip disappointing tracks, this album is worth a second look.  TIGERLILY is like a good novel that pulls you in at the beginning and releases you at the end.  <br />Some things that you will NOT find on this album are cliches and generic pop.  Being so original, of course your opinion on this album will be subject to your taste, so please take advantage of Amazon's track previews before buying.  I've owned this album for six years and its soothing melodies have never gotten old.  It's definitely my most-played CD.<br />Might I also recommend Ophelia and Motherland; Ms. Merchant continues to grow and evolve as an artist, and these more recent albums definitely each have their own character.  The songs and albums are each very diverse, even next to one another, as a testament to Ms. Merchant's versatility.  If you're looking for something creative, fresh, and always new, these three albums are definitely worth checking out.
6305327041|3.0|I didnt like this movie because it had people with a lot of hair.   whats with all that hair.  my brother Cleetus liked it when that thing happened, and then the other thing right after it.  i have to admit, i liked that part too.  the best part  was when the guy went into the buiding and was talking to the other guy for a while and then left.   that was crazy.   you might not like this movie... but if you like things that happen and people that talk to other people, you may very well like this movie. on a scale of 1-10 i definatly give this movie somewhere between 1 and 10
B000002BBY|5.0|(What's the Story) Morning Glory? Is quite simply one of the best albums ever made. Every single piece of this puzzle comes together perfectly, the songs, the arrangement, even the commonly overlooked song order. <br />As far as the individual songs go, they lack nothing. Whether you prefer long anthems or short tunes, this album has it. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Don't Look Back in Anger&quot; are sure to be some of the more memorable songs you have ever heard, and &quot;Roll With It&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; provide a perfect quick song. <br />Please, do yourself a favor and buy this album. This is one purchase you'll never regret.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This album is a lot of fun. I only see maybe 3-4 albums I play like this each year so it deserves 5 stars. Classic? It all depends on YOUR taste I guess. I just think it's a good solid, fun, album. It makes me want to smoke dope.
B00007BH3Y|4.0|Absolutely beautiful music, riveting, every delightful adjective imaginable that you can think of, I would use to describe the score for The Hours.  The movie was superb, but I feel that the score was/is the best part of this film.  Wonderful, wonderful music.  The first two songs are simply exquisite.
B00005QZWI|5.0|If you like instrumental, moody, music, this is the album for you. but it also has loud, hard-core battle music as well. if you like pure moods, enya, or any other instrumental mood music, you will love this album. it includes a whopping 18 wonderful songs, plus a link to the web! here is a review of the songs:<BR>1.the prophecy-3/5, a pretty good song<BR>2.concerning hobbits-5/5 a wonderful song! great music!<BR>3.the shadow of the past-5/5 really, really good.<BR>4.the treason of isengard-4/5 pretty good :-)<BR>5.the black rider-3/5 it's ok, like concerning hobbits but faster<BR>6.at the sign of the prancing pony-3/5 it's just good<BR>7.a knife in the dark-4/5 pretty good<BR>8.flight to the ford-4/5 good, good<BR>9.many meetings-3/5 well, it's ok<BR>10.the council of elrond-4/5 it's really good<BR>11.the ring goes south-4/5 this song is pretty good<BR>12.a journey in the dark-5/5 really cool<BR>13.the bridge of kazad-dum-5/5 great!<BR>14.lothlorien-4/5 eerie!<BR>15.the great river-5/5 awesome!<BR>16.amon hen-4/5 great battle song!<BR>17.the breaking of the fellowship-5/5 awesome!<BR>18.may it be-5/5 really good!<br />i hope you found this useful! if u like this album, then ull also like:<BR>-pure moods<BR>-pure moods 2<BR>-enya<BR>-the two towers soundtrack
0790729628|5.0|Blade runner is a very special movie in either version.  Both are dark and brooding and thought provoking.  Neither is merely a sci-fi thriller.  The movie influenced fashions in both films and dress that persist; in fact I know of no movie of the last half-century that has so influenced clothing and style.  The steamy film-noir atmosphere is frequently imitated now, but remember this is THE original.  I recently watched then DVD (Directors Cut) and the film has aged not one bit.<br />That said, it was NOT the directors cut that exerted these influences.  It was the original theatrical version with the loved/reviled voiceovers.  I recently tried to find a copy of the original version to replace my lost one and could not!  To let the 1982 version disappear would be a travesty.  I think the Directors Cut may be more watchable to the current generation.  However, to lose the original would be a blow to the sociologic history of recent decades.
6300273199|4.0|Today, I suppose, the borderline-inarticulate interviews would be set aside in a separate chapter on the DVD, but it was produced for presentation as a videotape.  The message was/is the music, and I believe they leave &quot;it&quot; all on the stage.<BR>  <BR>  The concert footage is all solid performance, none of the numbers are interrupted.  I'll buy it again as a DVD (!!).
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Does the song &quot;Stars&quot;, track 8, end abruptly with a strange tone and static, or is this a defect in my CD? Its my favorite song on the CD.  Somebody let me know please. Thanks.
B000068TPN|4.0|I thought this was a very well done movie of the early days of U.S. troop involvement in Viet Nam.  It portrayed Hal Moore exactly as he seems.  One note though:  be sure to watch the deleted scenes.  The Return to Camp Holloway and the Briefing by McNamara and General Westmoreland were wonderful - and disagreeing with the Director, I felt that these scenes should have been part of the movie.  The Return to Camp Holloway was just exceptionally moving.  The debriefing just hit the nail on the head - although I understand the director's comment about not wanting to make it political.  But Viet Nam was a very political war - just like the 2003 War in Iraq - soon to be - is.<br />I took away 1/2 star for the early bit of the French soldiers - the one with the bugle was just a bit too graphic
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norahs voice is sultry, with a hint of jazz and country. It's simply easy listening, calming and relaxing. It's very rare to  find an entire CD of selections that are good. The album is excellent! Well worth the purchase.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|the tatu cd is great i listen to it all the time. the songs are so catchy and great. the cd makes you very energetic. the songs are mostly about their love to eachother. there are all the things she said in russian and not gunna get us in russian and they are great. i dunt kno wat they are sayin (im not russian) but its great. this is definitly one of the best cds out there!!!
0385484518|5.0|I have been on a whirlwind spiritual journey for the last year - trying to become more in touch with my inner peace and develop my relationship with God. I've read many &quot;inspirational&quot; texts and found &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; to be one of the most down-to-earth and realistically inspirational books to date. Realistically inspirational in the sense that many of the aspects of life that you Morrie inspires you to change are easily able to be done. If you've ever been the type to become self-absorbed in the woes of your life, this is a must-read. This book puts into perspective the truly meaningful actions in one's life. Thank you Morrie and Mitch for a wonderful lesson.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Movies are the Opera of today: they combine drama with visual art and music in ways never explored before the 20th century. However, sadly, the quality of movie music is as wide-ranging and unpredictable as movies themself.<br />The Lord of the Rings obviously takes on a high calling to live up to the epic expectations of the book readers. However, I'm sure that the Box-Office earnings prove the movie's achievement of EPIC status. <br />Thank goodness then, Howard Shore knew what he was getting into when he became a part of this team. He has turned out a score not only worthy of the title &quot;epic&quot;, but worthy of comparison to Wagner's vastly scaled operas that attempt to encompass the entire world it seems. Amazingly, with such great room for error, Shore achieved some sense of this overarching archetype of the human pushing through the perilous journey of life.<br />To cut through my generalization mush- the bare facts are: Shore's score is powerful and evokative... it simultaneously paints a very detailed picture of the story, while searing images and melodies into our heads, making the power of the music even more powerful by &quot;sticking&quot; in our heads. It is truly great music, because of its thoughtfulness of atmosphere, tone-color and mood-manipulation that comes off in truly oringinal terms.<br />  Anyone who is a fan of the movie must own this CD. The  music speaks so clearly and uniquely apart from the movie even-- enriching your experience more. <BR>  And, if you are a fan of classical music-- you also must own this CD to understand how beautiful and Romantic modern music can still be- even when it is &quot;commercial&quot;. <BR>  And, if you don't like classical music-- you will STILL enjoy this score because of the remarkable accesiblilty and universality of Shore's communication.<br />So, please, do yourself a favor, and buy some modern music that will touch you in some way- excite you, calm you, take you somewhere and bring you back. Thats what music is for, and that is what this CD achieves.
B00005OAIE|1.0|but there isn't anything that great about this disc. it's not entirely bad...it's just a little low on the replay value. to prove my theory, i am going to wait a year or two and see how many copies of it start appearing on the racks of all my local used cd dealers. unless you absolutely love what you hear of him, resist the hooks and do the same.
0316666343|3.0|...This is an amazing first novel, brilliantly crafted, disturbing in scope. It deals with a shockingly horrible event--the rape and brutal murder of a 14-year old child--and the impact this event has on the girl herself (in heaven), her family, her friends and the murderer. It's a story of healing, of letting go, of justice.<br />I'm not sure if I recommend it or not...the dispassionate, detached way the author deals with intensely emotional events was, for me, disturbing.
B000002OAZ|4.0|I've read reviews of this that have called it a turkey, blues purists SEEM to hate it.  After all, these are white english kids, for cripes sake! Well, a lot of these white english kids helped a lot of American kids learn about stuff they had never heard of.  <br />I bought this album when it first came out.  I knew who Clapton was, I knew who Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts were, I knew who Stevie Winwood was.  I did NOT know who Howlin Wolf was.  So, as a result of this album I learned who Howlin Wolf was and eventually bought more of his albums.  <br />But regardless, this is an album that I enjoy listening too! I believe that the musicianship of the guys playing on this is much better than it's credited as being.  Yeah, the Red Rooster intro is one that probably should have been left out.  I've never been able to figure out why they left that in.  <br />I've read that Clapton has disparaged this album and his involvement in it.  I've never actually heard/read his words on this.  It makes me sad.  I've heard of lot of other stuff that has been released with the blessing of artists that truly sucks.  <br />Anyway, don't pass on this because some music critic panned it.  It's a darn good album.
006441034X|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this the first time and since then have enjoyed reading it over and over.  It makes for a very entertaining read and most of the characters (Calcifer was my fave!) are very interesting and easily understood; which is a must for a good book.  The book was funny, the plot flowed well and, for the most part, was easy to follow.  It is certainly not a masterpiece (not a Bronte or a Shakespeare), and it does have flaws (like an occasionally confusing plot and a rather abrupt ending), but it is a book that makes one laugh and makes one care about the characters, which keeps one coming back for re-reads.  The open ending also allows for the reader to make his/her own assumptions about what will happen to Sophie/Howl.<BR>   Even though this may not be the best book you'll ever read, it is a highly entertaining piece of light reading for in between weightier works.  I recommend buying a copy and keeping it in your desk drawer next to your best pen.
1402528965|4.0|Patricia Cornwell is one of the best suspense writers i have read in a long time.  Her knowledge on her stories makes it all the more better.  The characters are very well written.  I have read many of her beginning books and i think that some of them get better but some don't.  This book was one that didn't get much better from her previous novel. I think that when she writes a book, she really knows how to pull you in and keep you wanting more, but in this one a lot of the situations dragged on. I still enjoyed the book and am looking forward to reading more!
0060278269|4.0|Garth Nix, the almost universally acknowledged King of Fantasy, has done another outstanding job.  Although I personally think that he was at the top of his game with _Lirael_, _Abhorsen_ comes in a close second.<BR>There is a lot (i.e. EVERYTHING) at stake in this final book, which builds a LOT of tension.  I don't believe it's possible to put the book down without finishing it.  We as readers still get good looks into all of the characters, but we don't see as deeply as we did in the preceeding book.  Finally, the mystery of Mogget and the Disreputable Dog has been solved, and that was very satisfying.<BR>All in all, I thought the story flowed excellently well and came to a very natural ending.  I won't say what that ending was, but I will tell you that I think I cried, and not much can make me cry.  This was a wonderful book, but I preferred falling into The Old Kingdom in Lirael.  This book had more action, which I'm sure appeals to a different group of readers.  <BR>You did a great job, Nix, and I congratulate you.  If I ever own a dog, I will name her the 'Disreputable Dog.'
B000035P7X|4.0|Shall I review this film as a work of art or shall I review the actions and behaviors of the young Bob Dylan who is the focus of the film?  These would be two different reviews.  As a film portrait, this is excellent, although not in a conventional sense.  The filmwork is basic, even bootleg in quality, as is the sound.  You will have to turn it up to make out all the dialogue.  However, this lack of polish also lends a sense of intimacy to the film.  If you ever wanted to be a \\"fly on the wall\\" around Dylan as he was coming into his prime, then this film is just that.<br />On the other hand, as a subject of the film's focus, Bob Dylan reveals himself to be brilliant, engaging, and humorous, but also arrogant, condescending and even a little vicious.  The film captures it all without editorial commentary and what you make of it is your own.<br />By the way, I am a huge fan of Dylan's music and own all but a few of his albums.  But I was a little shocked to see his mind-games with interviewers and his moodiness.  This is no marble man at all.  Through it all, I concluded he was and is, in fact, a genius, but one who is both intoxicated by his fame while dismissive of fame altogether.  He walks a razor's edge between acting and speaking like a prophet while all the while mocking the very idea that a singer/songwriter can be a prophet at all.  Like many artists to follow (Cobain?), Dylan seems to struggle against his rising fame, sometimes angrily, sometimes humorously, sometimes cleverly, sometimes snidely.<br />The film is engaging and deserves your attention if you are interested in early Dylan.  And the music is incredible.  Recommended.
006441034X|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this the first time and since then have enjoyed reading it over and over.  It makes for a very entertaining read and most of the characters (Calcifer was my fave!) are very interesting and easily understood; which is a must for a good book.  The book was funny, the plot flowed well and, for the most part, was easy to follow.  It is certainly not a masterpiece (not a Bronte or a Shakespeare), and it does have flaws (like an occasionally confusing plot and a rather abrupt ending), but it is a book that makes one laugh and makes one care about the characters, which keeps one coming back for re-reads.  The open ending also allows for the reader to make his/her own assumptions about what will happen to Sophie/Howl.<BR>   Even though this may not be the best book you'll ever read, it is a highly entertaining piece of light reading for in between weightier works.  I recommend buying a copy and keeping it in your desk drawer next to your best pen.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Once again, Johnny Cash has put out yet another simply incredible cd.  His cover of the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Hurt&quot; is enough reason alone to buy this cd.  This is one of the most emotional albums I have heard in years.  If you're not a country music fan, it doesn't matter - you'll still love this album, as it is alternative in nature as well.  It's amazing!
B00006RIO7|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie for Valentine's Day, and were both just astounded.  Everything about this movie was excellent, but the music has to be the best thing about it.  The songs are all sung by the actors and actresses themselves, and most people will be amazed at the vocal talents of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zellweiger, Richard Gere, and of course Queen Latifa.  The songs are strong, emotional, power-packed, and just plain catchy to boot.  No one who hears this soundtrack will walk away without goosebumps, and humming a tune!
B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Shadow of a doubt, Marnie, Psycho) is one of his most respected films. Practically his first cinematic landmark shot in color, REAR WINDOW is a scary, quality film. A man suspects his neigbor GETS IN AN ARGUMENT WITH A WOMAN (HIS WIFE) and they fight, the lights go out and a scream is heard. He killed her, right? Later in the film, when he sends his girlfriend to go in the house for clues as the supposed killer leaves, the girlfriend (Grace Kelly) gets trapped as the attacker rushes back home, he finds her and grabs her, shutting off the lights, a shreik is heard, you see the girl moving, struggling from the attacker's grip. The boyfriend calls the police, he has a broken leg and can't move, help or do anything but hope they come on time. The scene where the attacker finds out his girlfriend was the one who spied on him, the attacker comes to kill him, who will survive in this suspenseful classic that holds grip, romance, drama, suspense and mystery until the final shot.
B000002J1I|3.0|One of Yes' most maligned albums, and deservedly so if taken in context of the mastery and brilliance of what came before.  However, removed from the understandable disappointment of encountering this odd duck after the string of classics that preceeded it, this is NOT all bad.  \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" would hold up well on many of the classic albums and is one of the best showcases for bass guitar in rock music. It thins out quite a bit after that, but \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" and \\"Onward\\" are both quite good, straightforward songs by a rock band that can play its instruments.  Add to this a couple of listenable songs that don't measure up to Yes' earlier standards, but are no worse than what their imitators were doing at the time: \\"Future Times/Rejoice,\\" \\"Madrigal,\\" and \\"Release, Release.\\"  Some will (with some justification) decry these as lightweight, and even as a Yes fan I think at moments they approach self-parody. I still don't mind listening on occasion.<br />Which leaves you with \\"Arriving UFO\\" and \\"Circus Of Heaven,\\" two songs which could charitably be called whimsical or goofy, but are clearly (along with some of the other song titles) what people most focus on when they say they hate this album. It would be fair to say that Hipgnosis was reacting to these songs when designing the tomato-splattered album cover. They are truly horrible, airy-fairy, failed experiments. This is what people who hate Yes think all Yes is like.  <br />No wonder Squire, Howe, and White went for such a heavy sound on Drama after Wakeman and Anderson split! (Wakeman solo material from this time, like \\"Rocket and Roll Prophet\\" which boasted the song \\"I'm So Straight I'm a Weirdo,\\" actually make Tormato's worst moments sound brilliant. Anderson, on the other hand, was making good music with Vangelis.)<br />I still give this album 3 stars because \\"Silent Wings of Freedom\\" is that good and most is listenable. Just have that remote handy to skip the turkeys.
0783225849|5.0|As the tension builds up to a spine tingling climax, Psycho, directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Marnie, Saboteur, Rear Window) is possibly the greatest scary movie ever and definately one of my top 5 favorite movies ever. Norman bates runs his own motel, but history reveals more, his mother died and she haunts him and the hotel, his psychological problem makes him want to kill women who come to the hotel with a resemblence to his mom. The Bates house is across the road and the mother's corpse is upstairs...and other horrifying surprises, mystery, suspense and drama unfold in this compelling, haunting film that pushed boundaries and broke a wall in horror history!
0780631684|5.0|Its an awsome movie on of my 3 favorite horror movies ever made, Ali Larter is really hott!!! Its bloody (for those who like blood and gore in a horror movie), its got lots of action too!!! SOme othere cool actors in it is Sean William Scott(you get to see him get his head chopped off). Its a good movie i definetly recommend it ot anyone who likes horror movies
B00005JL7Q|4.0|For those who saw Four Weddings and a Funeral this has to be Hugh Grant's redemming picture, after some of the films he has been in.<br />Grant is back to being his usual cad self, who finds his life turned upside down, and his values questioned, after a lonely boy enters his life. Grant fits the role like a glove, and his performance along side his young costar really make this film shine.<br />While comedic in nature, it is also a moving films as we watch these two unlikely companions challenge each other and themselves. Based on Nick Hornby's book of the same name the film sticks fairly close to the story line with a few minor changes.<br />About A Boy is a well made, well acted film that is sure to entertain.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This music CD is pretty old but once you listen to all the songs you will like them so much like one song called the Anthem sounds so cool once you listen to it you'llnever want to stop listening.
0385335482|4.0|I was offered this book by my wife on our holidays after I ran out of books to read.<br />To say this is not an epic novel is putting it mildly, but the story line made it impossible to put down and I devoured the book in one day.<br />A humourous look into the life of a nonstop shopping machine, I think we can all releate to the main character whether we are her, or know people like her.<br />The plot reads like waves on the ocean, as we follow the lead characters shopping sprees, and financial troubles rise and falter as she tries to juggle her persoanl life as badly as her check book.<br />A fun fast read that is sure to please
B00005YW4H|3.0|I bought this CD after Norah Jones was nominated for all of her Grammy's. It's a decent CD, but is quickly becoming a coaster for my drinks. Norah has a beautiful voice, but all of the songs on the CD sound the same. It may as well have had Come Away with Me 10 times over and over again. Norah's voice is very soothing and dreamy, but this CD can easily put someone to sleep. If you want someone who can play the piano with some emotion and range, try Dana Glover.
1587990717|5.0|As a trader and trainer / coach of other traders I have found Randomness absolutely brilliant.  I must add that we day trade the forex market and living with that price action is a lesson in randomness second to none. The section on &quot;noise&quot; is probably the best part of the book. It helped me to clarify many concepts that lies at the heart of short-term trading.  I love it - stand aside &quot;Reminiscences of a Stock Operator&quot; you have been de-throned (at least on my list).
B000002JSP|5.0|I love this CD. I bought this In Through the Out Door when it first came out. I have had it ever since. Tim
B00004TS0E|4.0|This remake is really good!It tells the story of a man put on trial in the belief he's insane because he thinks he is Santa.Mara Wilson,who takes on the role Natalie Wood mand famous is great.The story is much the same as the original,but my favorite part is the trial,which ends DIFFERNTly!How does it end in this one?To find out,buy this remarkable remake!It's good wholesome holiday fun.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Foxtrot Hotel is Wilco's fourth studio album.  With each preceeding album they've dug deeper and deeper to a new level of melodic harmony.  &quot;AM&quot; was a good first album, &quot;being There&quot; was a big step forward and then came &quot;Summerteeth&quot; which was the best album the year it was released.  Throw in a couple Woody Guthrie Mermaid Avenue albums.  Then comes &quot;Yankee Foxtrot Hotel&quot;.  This album is, simply put, amazing.  When I first heard it the first thing that came to mind was Radiohead's &quot;Kid A&quot; and Sonic Youth's &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;.  This album isn't for the faint of heard, nor for those of light musical tastes.  It takes a couple listens to try and get a feel for it.
B0000025DV|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews for this, as stated above I was confused by the need for many people to favor one song over another, or one side of this cd over another. Even more disheartening was the editorial review at the beginning. Basically I'm just surprised there aren't more people like me who recognize this CD for what it is, an utter masterpiece that could not do without a single song. For me which songs are best on this depends on my mood and what I'm looking for at the time, but however I feel, I'm always ready to sit down and play the whole thing from beginning to end and relish the joys of hearing one of those very few, very rare perfect CDs and can put this up there with CDs like Ziggy Stardust and A Night at the Opera where the essence of each CD is to never betray the excellence of the CD as a whole, many CDs won't feel so much like CDs but as a bunch of songs put on a disc, with those CDs discarding tracks is easy... With a CD like this it'd be like plucking out one section of one of your favorite songs, which really doesn't make any sense at all. Anyways, for those of you who want symphonic theatric classic rock at it's most epic, pick this up now or you'll surely regret it.
B0000508U6|5.0|I listen to this CD everyday in my car.  I can't ever imagine getting sick of listening to it.
B000001ED1|5.0|...I hadn't listend to this album in years. Goin' through my collection the other night, there it was. And on it went. And damn. It's really a great album, every track, except maybe \\"One of Us\\". And I can't stop listening to it, again, like 1995. It's her voice. The melodies. The rock. The blues. The piano. The voice!<br />Fans of good music, taste and style, must own this album. It's not pop, except for the \\"One of Us\\" song. You can almost hear the Polygram execs pleading with Joan to record one Top 40 tune for Relish.<br />A note to the dudes: Dudes, buy it. It'll look good in your collection. The ladies will really think you got class. Well, the classy ladies that is.<br />Not enough solo artists, or bands, make music like this anymore.
0679722610|5.0|The story is told by an agent from the Continental Detective Agency. He has been called to the town of Personville or, as he explains, is more aptly named, Poisonville. His client is Donald Willsson, but Willsson is shot and killed before the Continental Op can meet him. He decides to visit Willson's father, Elihu, who until recently ran the town. Elihu Willson winds up hiring the Continental Op to clean up the town by getting rid of the town's 3 criminal bosses. In true gangster-style, the names of the criminals are Max \\"Whisper\\" Thaler, Lew Yard and Pete the Finn.<br />The clean up job becomes the main focus of the rest of the book, although along the way, the Continental Op manages to solve the murder of his original client as well as most other minor crimes that spring up around him. The Continental Op is an interesting character, having no qualms about setting others up, knowingly placing them in mortal danger in order to uncover evidence or confirm his suspicions. He will lie, cheat and double-cross just about anyone.<br />The deaths come thick and fast and are mentioned off-handedly, almost as an afterthought. Red Harvest is fast moving and entertaining and as hardboiled as they come.
B000068PQ0|5.0|After listening to this album about 30 times through over the course of the last few weeks, I have decided this is the best overall rock album of 2002. It has several marks of a great record, there's not a single bad song and every song seems to serve its purpose in a sort of song cycle. The songs are deceptively simple lyrically, and reveal more depth with each listen. The production is simply amazing, combining their own neo-psychedelic style with post-Kid A electronic experimentation and huge, engulfing symphonic orchestrations. Everything seems dense and jumbled at first but in its own way all the instruments take their rightful place in the mix creating a full and varied sound. The best songs are the intro track, Fight Test, Ego Tripping and Do You Realise (which should have been a shoe in for best song of the year). Also notable are Approaching Pavonis Mars... which won best instrumental rock performance at this years grammies, and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt.2 which almost reminds me of Ween. In short everyone should give this album a shot regardless of what sort of music you prefer, and pop/rock fans should snatch this up immediately. This is an instant classic, a visionary album that will likely shape the direction of pop music in the new millenium.
0312305060|5.0|I have always enjoyed Virginia Wolf and her novel Mrs. Dalloway but The Hours blows me out of the water. It is powerful. The character who has aids and throws himself out of the window at the end as he describes what it's like living only for his friend, the hours that pass, the misery is so overwhelming. The way the characters run together through time, this author explores Virginia's non linear style of telling a story that she made so famous very handsomely, bringing in a vibrancy that makes it thrilling and fresh. A must have.
B00006AFF5|1.0|First of all, i don't see any reason for this movie to have been made.  The half-hour cartoon was by far better made and more memorable.  30 minutes is all it takes to tell the story of a Scrooge-like character who get his Christmas comeuppance.  We really don't need all the back-ground fill, childhood experiences, and toilet humor (a sleeping mayor being duped into kissing a dog's backside - and this is a kid's movie?!) to pad out a simple holiday tale.  Not fun.  Not amusing.   Just dull dull dull!
B000003TAR|5.0|Scentless Aprentice is on this album.  Nothing else needs to be said.<br />Except that the rest is still incredibly good.
B000002TYX|5.0|This first Anthology CD has lots of treasures, including the earliest recordings The Beatles made.<br />The spoken word segments are interesting, I think. It is helpful that they have been assigned a track each, so that you don't have to listen to them every time you play the CD.<br />A lot of the material was previously released on expensive bootleg recordings. These LPs, tapes and CDs were often marketed at about twice the price of commercial recodings, and were often only 15 minutes long.<br />The sound quality of the Anthology is vastly superior and much much cheaper than those now superseded pirate recordings. Even if the Anthology series had not been produced, it would still be hard to sell those bootlegs in our peer-to-peer on-line environment.<br />Some of my favourite tracks:<br />Free As A Bird It is great to hear The Beatles together, even if one member was not able to appear personally. Real Love is a better song, but FAAB was a great introduction to the Anthology set, I think.<br />Three Cool Cats and The Sheik of Araby are great fun. I love the \\"not 'arf!\\" in Sheik.<br />How Do You Do It It is interesting to hear how The Beatles, however reluctantly,  performed this song, later recorded by Gerry and The Pacemakers[who, some say, are now geriatrics *with* pacemakers].<br />One After 909 The alternative versions made available in this set are interesting and this one is a real gem.<br />Leave My Kitten Alone is one of the best songs recorded, but not released by The Beatles.<br />I'll Be Back is one several songs on the Anthology series which let us listen to The Beatles creating their masterpieces. It is great to hear this version with a different metre and feel, and The Beatles evaluation of their experiments.<br />Not the best of the 3 sets, but well worth owning and listening to every once in a while.
B000002LQR|5.0|this Cd is full of songs with great rythms and crazy lyrics.  the title track is their best song ever, and is quite possibly one of my ten favorites.  included in my ten are songs from the Stones, Sabbath, Zeppelin, Nirvana, and Metallica
0425173755|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Agatha Christie does a wonderful job of weaving together clues, characters and occurances. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in mysteries. Good job if you can figure out 'whodunnit' without someone telling you how it ends!
B0000035E7|5.0|Bleach is easily nirvana's greatest album.  Blew is their best song along with Scentless Aprentice (in utero).  It has no pop sound, excpet for a tiny bit in About a Girl, Which is by no means even in the top 5 for this album.<br />Bleach is a grunge CD you can listen straight through without a single distasteful song, and triumphs over Nevermind and Insecticide easily.  In Utero is almost as good.<br />You must get it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Before I go on, I have to say that this album is perhaps the first album I've ever heard where each song is as good as the next. Songs like \\"Last Nite\\", \\"Hard To Explain\\", \\"Someday\\", and \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" symbolize the band's pure rock energy, while tunes like the beautifully melodic \\"Is This It\\" show the band's softer side. The Strokes are a wonderful combination of Singer Julian Casablancas' overdriven, emotional vocals, Guitarist Nick Valensi's energetic ryhthms, Guitarist Albert Hammond's melodic leads, Bassist Nikolai Fraiture's bouncing lines, and Drummer Fabrizio Moretti's raw pounding. Each song will leave you crying for more, and I hope to see more from these talented young musicians who are saving rock n' roll as we know it.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast captured our hearts on VHS! Now on DVD the music comes alive in your own living room as if you right there with Belle and all her new found friends. My toddler loves how the music dances from speaker to speak with surround sound. They even have a new song added to this special addition, which is called, &quot;Human Again.&quot; It's now apart of our collection of favorite Disney songs. Buy this DVD and share the magical moments that all Disney movies possess with your family and loved ones.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This is a long overdue DVD, one I have been waiting for, for a very long time.  This was the first foreign film I ever watched and every  felt a true passion for.  I watched this for the first time when I was 18, and it helped open me to a world beyond brain-dead action and mindless horror films.  It is very stylistic and visually stunning, especially 'The Peach Orchard'.  Kurosawa is a true genius, and without a doubt, the greatest film director of all time, and I can not wait to watch this film in fine DVD style!
B00005QDW5|5.0|How can you have a definitive Pinkl Floyd collection without 'Careful With That Axe, Eugene,' 'One Slip,' 'Atom Heart Mother Suite,' 'Dogs,' 'Sysyphus,' or 'The Narrow Way Part 3?'<BR>The only way we could get a more complete collection is a normal style Box Set. Since Pink Floyd has tried to avoid that, we're going to have to live with this.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Best hard core rock in the world, has some awsome lyrics and does have the talent of singing.
B000001FAS|5.0|When I listen to this CD, I'm back in Chem lab in 1972 with my partner Jim. He had the original vinyl album in his bag and while we waited for some reaction to complete, we sat mesmerized looking at the amazing artwork inside of the album jacket - what a trip! This was before walkmen so I had to wait until I got home to listen to the tunes - I get chills thinking about the first time I heard One Way Out. I had it cranked through my headphones to &quot;blood out the ear canal&quot; levels singing like a fool. The guitar work is amazing, the vocals tight - it's all there. This album is a time capsule. One listen and it's back to another time (some would say better time) and a better place - when it was all about the music and love. Every rock fan has to have this CD in his or her collection - even if it's just for Blue Sky.
0393312836|5.0|I loved this book because Burgess manages to do so much to enhance the imagery and feel of it by using a language he invented, known as Nadsat. It is reminiscent of Russian, with gutteral undertones and an English spin, and it is perfect for the characters in the book. While the violence in this novel is profoundly disturbing (made even more so by the words used to describe it), it is disturbing with a purpose. Without making the crimes of Alex (the main character, a violent 15-year-old) horrendous, the novel wouldn't pose such profound moral questions. While the reader is driven to hate Alex by the crimes he commits (which include ...torturing as a way of regular entertainment), the horrible treatment he is given by the government (which causes him to go into horrible spasms and fits of nausea at even the slightest thought of violence ...) inspires some sympathy for him, even if its only on the level of his being a 'victim of the state'. The question arises, should Alex be forced to endure this treatment as a way of 'purifying him', or should he be allowed to choose whether to be a psychopath or a good member of society?<br />Another theme arising in this novel is of the nature of human change and of violence being an activity primarily of youth. Unfortunately, you will not get any hint of this unless you read the book with the 21st chapter added on. Originally, the book was published in the US with this chapter hacked off (it is not featured in Kubrick's movie), but thankfully in subsequent additions it has been added and it really changes the meaning of the book.<br />So if you have a penchant for language and can handle 'a bit of the old ultraviolence', I would strongly recommend this book.
B00003CXXM|3.0|This film is a nonstop ride from beginning to end.  The European backdrop is sublime, the acting performances of Damon and Potente are riveting, and the plot moves along in a dramatic and stylish pace.  <BR>It's just not that believable.  <BR>And spy-thrillers, no matter how well done, are nothing new.  <BR>The Bourne Identity delivers its promise of being a cutting-edge modern day thriller, without the cheesy artlessness of formualaic blockbuster tripe.  Basically, everything is in place for a perfect movie.  <BR>Which is maybe why I can't give this movie four stars.  While it is definitely worth watching, showcasing loads of talent and energy, I came away from the movie feeling unchanged.  It was as if I had just watched a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;North By Northwest&quot;, and while it is truly exciting like that movie, it was done first by that movie.  <BR>In conclusion, this movie will entertain you for two hours, and you will have fun.  It is a rare action movie treat in it's unconventional take on the spy-thriller genre.  We'll just have to wait a little bit longer until the true brilliance of those who worked on this film is realized.
0316666343|5.0|In \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" Alice Sebold captures heartache and tragedy with all the fervor of one who's been there.  As the title suggests, this book is beautiful, full of the exquisite writing found in great literature...and, more impressively, it is gritty, with the earthiness of a classic mystery.  Being a male reader, I feared a melodramatic approach; I found instead a meditative directness.<br />The story starts with an unusual form of narration: a first person omniscient viewpoint.  Susie Salmon, a fourteen year old girl brutally murdered by a neighbor, tells us the story from a personal point of view that, nevertheless, allows us to see into the minds and motives of the other characters as Susie observes them from heaven.  Although the story starts dispassionately, I found this method effective.  As readers, we are able to digest the facts without becoming overwhelmed.  Sebold slowly unveils the emotion and heart in the story, using her unique narrator's perceptions to delve into the details surrounding both sides of the murder.<br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" surprised me in a number of aspects.  It refrained from sappiness, while squeezing emotion from numerous scenes.  It kept me in suspense, while avoiding the obvious solutions.  It confronted me with insights into family and life and the passage of time.  Although I'm not sure that the view of heaven--a somewhat reserved and mundane portrayal--parallels my own views and those I find in the Bible, it does address issues of forgiveness and redemption, of healing and honesty.<br />Finally, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" takes chances.  Sebold uses a bold approach and a tricky act toward the end to keep us riveted in our seats.  Some readers may want a more tangible conclusion, but I applaud the writer's ability to stretch our thinking beyond our finite world.  Only one such as Sebold, one who has confronted horror and pain, could be so exquisitely grounded.  The title says it all.
B000002KIE|5.0|I used to call this the best Aerosmith album they never made, but Mr. Tyler doesn't have a British accent. That being said I view this more as a hard rock album than a punk album.<br />Musically it's pretty good. Thankfully, any playing Sid Vicious did for this album was left off or buried deep in the mix. Most of the bass is by Glen Matlock who was a key songwriter too.<br />Glen, however, was not 'punk' enough for the stage and fired. He did return after being fired to do some polishing in the studio (according to John's bio).<br />I never find this album boring.  It's always one I can turn to for some good rebelious guitar rock. Pretty Vacant, indeed.
B00008977N|5.0|I saw the Secret World tour in San Francisco, LA, San Diego, and Sacramento.  This was the high point of Peter Gabriels concert tours, far surpassing Shock the Monkey and Growing Up.  The visuals on the DVD are somewhat grainy, some of the content has been overdubbed, but the choreography by Robert Le Page are well captured here.  Sound quality is outstanding, and if you have a surround system, you will love the drumming of Manu Katche.  Highly recommended.
B000000993|4.0|Although not a good album for your anger management, this is the first in a series of three great albums by this group. And, how many bands have produced a trilogy of albums that could all be considered classics?  Like Aenima and Lateralus, this album has a couple of songs which are immediately likeable, and although not so much as Tool's later work, the album as a whole can be appreciated with subsequent listening.  While it's not as progressive or experimental as the following two albums, the haunting sounds of Undertow push it beyond it's genre.
0140186409|2.0|The Grapes of Wrath may be to many people a triumph of American storytelling, but I found it to very stale and overwrought. This may be due solely to the fact that I do not enjoy Steinbeck's writing style, but I think it is also because he pushes the story to the limit, and in essence milks all of the entertaining qualities of his characters to death way before the story is over.<br />While the Grapes of Wrath has several 'nuggets' of brilliance (my favorite one involving a Native American chief), they are so swamped in boring sub-plots and narratives that switch back and forth that the novel can hardly be considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 619 pages you hardly care what happens to the Joad family, just as long as the darn thing is over with.<br />In short, while I hate to discourage those who think this book is a triumph of 'American perseverance', I have to say that if you really want to know about the Dust Bowl (which is actually a fascinating period in history) read a history book, not this novel.
B00006LJ72|5.0|First of all I did not buy the box set because for me it would be a waste of money.I already have all her albums and all of her singles,so I dont need this one.However,some of Enya's fans may not.Or someone may just be getting into her music.For those people this would be a great chance to get nearly all of her songs at once at a good price.For this reason I give it 5 stars.Now that thats out of the way one last thing.I dont mind people saying they dont like Enya's music.People do have different taste in music.What I dont like is hearing or reading things like,her music should be pulled of the shelves,and nobody in there right mind would listen to her.GET REAL.Are they saying I dont have the right to listen to her music?I dont like the dixie chicks,pink or Britney Spears but alot of people do and they have the right to listen to it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been around for 20 years and have accomplished a lot in that amount of time, and amazingly have until recently, kept their  style of punk/funk/rap pretty similar to how it sounded when they first started out [which sounded like what you might get if you crossed Faith No More with 311]. However this changed with their 1995 album \\"One Hot Minute\\".<br />That album strayed a fair amount gving them a broader alternative rock sound than they had earlier had and the reaction was split amung the fans. This album, to some extent melds the two styles together. This album definitely has more of an alternative rock feel to it then their earlier albums. Most of all though, this album is far more varied that probably any of their other albums, which is why it's my personal favorite out of their records. if you take any given RHCP album before One Hot Minute then chances are that about half the songs on there are their signature rap/rock breed [such as Suck My Kiss and Fight Like A Brave]. <br />This album offers a lot more variety while still keeping room for some songs that sound like their earlier stuff, such as \\"All Around the World\\" and \\"Get On Top\\". A great amount of this album however is relatively unexplored terrority for the peppers, from the neo-beach sound of Californication to the post grunge feel of \\"Otherside\\", the Chili Pppers prove themselves as a more versatile band then many people would have thought them to be. I own a wide range fo cd's [and three other RHCP ones besides this] and this I would have to say is all around my favorite album of all time. It's so varied that you can listen to it for quite some time without it ever sounding repetative and if you like By The Way or one Hot Minute then you'll rpoabably like this one, or even if you didn't then you out to give it a try because you just might be surprised.
6305014140|5.0|This is an amazing movie, I am a huge fan. I have recently heard that a 10 year anniversary edition will be availible in June. I am looking forward to seeing all the enhancements it will contain. I highly recommend this movie, thought it is a touch violent and definally not aimed at a younger audience. All anime fans I have known have always placed this in, or near there top 5 of all time, and I can agree with that.
B000088E6M|5.0|Any real hip-hop/rap fan out there should pick up 50 Cent's album right now. It's the best out of the new year and no other record comes close.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Unbeleavable. Just when I think I have seen the best movie in the Fellowship of the Ring, then comes two towers... WOW. Now there is one problem.. The movie is sooooo action packed, that any adventure and compeling story are a little watered down. Im not saying there was no real \\"story\\" or adventure in the Two Towers, I just think Fellowship had more. But other then that, this one has outdone it's first installment many times over. Very cool fight at Helms Deep, cool CG character in Golum, and all around beautifull settings. If u still have this movie in your part of the country.. U MUST SEE IT...
B0000797IO|1.0|I was disappointed in the movie.  It was billed &quot;A Comedy of Winning Delicacy and Heart&quot;.  There was nothing comical about it.  I expected something more like Picture Perfect with Jennifer Aniston...that is a comedy.  I lost interest in the middle of the movie. I watched it to the end but am sorry that I bought it.
B00000DOZB|4.0|Along with &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans,&quot; the 1974 album &quot;Relayer&quot; constitutes the third stage in the career of Yes.  The first was the early experimental stuff nobody remembers and the second stage was their glory years with &quot;The Yes Album,&quot; &quot;Fragile,&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge.&quot;  The group was clearly moving in the direction of &quot;suites&quot; (i.e., single &quot;songs&quot; that took up an entire side of a record) and in this third stage they indulged in this approach to the extreme.  &quot;Relayer&quot; had only three songs: &quot;Gates of Delirum&quot; on side 1, and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; and &quot;To Be Over&quot; on side 2.  These suites alternate between instrumental sections where guitarist Steve Howe, bass player Chris Squire, keyboardist Patrick Moraz, and drummer Alan White are given there opportunities to solo, and  vocal and choral sections when singer Jon Anderson lapses into spirutal lyrics.  On the one hand this is what they had been doing before, but now the sense of structure that made the early suites so great is pretty much missing.  &quot;Relayer&quot; comes across more like a studio jam session, which will strike some Yes fans as being pretentious and others as a worthwhile musical exercise.  For others as long as Roger Dean does the cover painting that is justification enough for picking up this album (at least you could use record covers as art; hard to do that with CDs).  It all depends on what you think Yes's music was all about in the end.
B000002LOM|3.0|I have to weigh in and say that this is a damn good record, not his best, but damn good. WAY better than his post-Vauxhall output. T<br />his, Bona Drag, and Your Arsenal make up what I believe to be Morrissey's post-Smiths glory years. He was still young and could back up all of his pretentiousness. The late nineties and 00's have proved that he is a bit of a parody of himself -- Not here. <br />If &quot;Your Arsenal&quot; was his &quot;glam&quot; album (whatever that means) thab this was his, well quasi-retro album of sorts. <br />It's usually anly about 8 bucks at Tower so pick it up if you are at all curious.
B000021YQV|2.0|DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYBODY SAYS! This album is such a letdown after the first. Even their b-sides are better than this! Ugh! This is the perfect example of a band that reahces their haitus, and figures no matter what they do people will buy into it any way, so they make a horrible album. This album is like Nonpoints Development letdown after their groundbreaking Statement. Bad stuff. Keep away from this cliche trendy little cop-out band.
B00005N83M|5.0|I'm a big fan of jenny, and i feel she's acieved alot. I think te first album was better but my favorite song is Aint it funny.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I watched this movie without knowing what it was going to be about. I loved trainspotting, but this is so dark and real, so frightening and extreme, you have to see it!<BR>The movie portrays three conected characters, who all are hooked on drugs. Just one year changes their lives so imense, that it is almost surreal, but the director has the skills to package the whole thing so good, that you believe it is happening and you feel the pain.<BR>It was a real nightmare seeing the missery, especially the things Marion has to go through. This movie makes you wanna stop drugs atleast for a week. <BR>The coolest part are the MTV like cuts and the repeating drug images, they incrase durring towards the end of the movie. <br />The best movie if you wanna quit drugs, at least for a while.
6305531374|3.0|Kevin Williamson ... apparently loves the Halloween movies, or so i heard. If he really does, then he should have kept his hands on his own franchise instead of ruining John Carpenter's masterpiece. The idea and plot for the movie was ok, but dissgarding the previous sequels (from part 3 to 6) was a really ridicoulus idea. Also having almost no murder sequences and attempting to make it more \\"Scream\\" was a biiiig mistake. The actors was to live with, but director Steve Miner, who directed the dumbest entries in the Friday The 13th franchise (part 2 & 3), was a huuuge mistake as well. Buy the six first movies instead, and skip this movie and the 8th one...
B000021Y7X|5.0|Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I find the manic camera movements and rapid-fire edits exhibited in the overwhelming majority of music videos and concert movies not only to be headache-inducing but detrimental to the underlying performance.  Instead of focusing on the quality of the music being played and the musician's presentation, the viewer inevitably becomes distracted by the show-offy angles and technical gimmicks.  What this approach ultimately reveals is the director's lack of confidence both in the performance's ability to stand on its own and in the viewer's ability to focus for more than a few seconds at a time.  It's as if the makers envision their product being viewed predominantly by an audience of attention-deficient fidgeters who are hopped up on Jolt Cola. <br />A stunning exception to this trend is Stop Making Sense--the majestic concert movie featuring the Talking Heads (circa 1983) and directed by Jonathan Demme (\\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" \\"Philadelphia\\").  Demme has the good sense (not to mention, humility) to realize that the music and stage presence of the Talking Heads--and especially the band's leader, David Byrne--are more than capable of carrying the film.  Instead of injecting himself clumsily into the proceedings, Demme unobtrusively and effectively captures the amazing music, the spare but striking imagery, and the unrestrained energy of a Talking Heads show.  And, oh, what a show it is!<br />The concert begins with David Byrne performing a hypnotic, stripped-down version of \\"Psycho Killer,\\" featuring only Byrne's acoustic guitar and pre-recorded beats played on a boombox.  From the moment we first see Byrne on stage--his head bobbing with each beat and looking equal parts stylish, nerdy, and eerie--his mesmerizing stage presence is immediately apparent and becomes the focal point of the film.  Following this stunning opener, Byrne is joined by an additional band member for each subsequent song until the line-up is fully fleshed out.  This simple yet innovative device builds the excitement slowly so that by the time the full band belts out \\"Burning Down the House\\" and \\"Life During Wartime,\\" the viewer is about ready to jump out his skin and dance around the living room (or whatever room the DVD is playing in).<br />Each of the songs in the concert is excellently arranged and expertly played, outshining by far their studio versions (which is saying something).  And the joy and energy with which the songs are played become contagious.  (I dare you to try and sit still through the entire film.)  Subtle lighting and scenery changes ensure that each song has its own distinctive look and feel.  Some of the Talking Heads' lesser-known songs stand out as some of movie's best:  \\"Thank You for Sending Me an Angel,\\" \\"Found a Job,\\" \\"Making Flippy Floppy,\\" and \\"This Must Be the Place (Naïve Melody)\\" are each remarkable.  Other stand-outs include \\"Once in a Lifetime,\\" \\"Slippery People,\\" \\"Swamp,\\" and \\"Take Me to the River.\\"  <br />Through it all, Demme's steady camerawork documents the unbounded excitement of the concert without intruding upon it with excessive quick-cuts, annoying audience reaction shots, and backstage interviews.  Demme's greatest gift to the audience is that we don't even realize he's there.<br />Stop Making Sense is the best concert film ever made and gives Hard Day's Night a run for its money as best rock-n-roll movie of all-time.  This is one raucous musical celebration you won't want to miss.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I have come to believe that no matter how poor the script, or how small the part, If Jean Reno is in the film, the thing's worth watching. Of all the Reno/Besson films, this is the only one I've seen where Reno is TRULY allowed to display the astonishing depths of his tallent and ability. As the character Leon, he granted the space and time to show the world that HE is this generation's MOST phenominally able performer. With the exception some absurd & unsubtle \\"overacting\\" by the performer who played the main \\"villian\\"- all the supporting performances are superb. They team up with Monsieur Reno to make an already amazing story & script into an undisputible masterpiece of filmaking.<br />I heartily wish that Reno would make more American films, and with equal earnestness, I wish he would look to directors other than Luc Besson. Frankly, talent wise, Reno is WAY out of Besson's league; a fact that is painfully obvious in most of Jean Reno's Besson directed films. Generally, the material is beneath him; it is simply not good enough for Reno to even bother with.
0783229526|5.0|First of all, I would only recommend this movie to those who have at some time in their lives had some psychadelic experiences (or those who want to).  Anyone who hasn't is probably going to look down on the film.  But those who have will understand exactly what Duke and Dr. Gonzo are going through.<br />This is one of the greatest movies ever made.  And it's not supposed to be a straight comedy.  Yeah, it's funny, but it's even more realistic.  The director did an excellent job of portraying exactly how it is on an acid trip with peoples' faces morphing and patterns seeming to move.  The reason for this is that Hunter S. Thompson, aka Raoul Duke, was on the set helping, and he has done every drug known to man.  The movie might as well be a true story.  Johnny Depp does an excellent job pretending to be Thompson and acting like he's tripping on acid or mescaline or adrenachrome or ether (And to that first reviewer, you don't snort Ether).  The acting is almot flawless.  At some times it actually seems as if Depp and del Toro are using drugs during the filming.  The book is really good because Hunter S. Thompson actually wrote it, but the movie is still awesome.  Its the best movie to watch while tripping, and it will also teach you a few things about the drug culture.<br />If your a teenager interested in opening the doors of perception, I would strongly recommend this movie.  Or if your an adult who would like to reminisce about your hippie days, I would recommend it to you too.<br />Overall, this is just a great, highly entertaining movie.
B00005U122|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this show live, and was delighted to find the DVD was filmed THE NEXT NIGHT in Portland. It absolutely lives up to my expectations. My fifth row center seats at the Shoreline show were great, but this DVD allows me the luxury of not standing for two hours, not to mention the lack of &quot;aromatic herb&quot;. All in all an excellent film of an incredible evening with an incredible talent.

0679720200|5.0|We are taught, at least through western institutions, to apply sense in everything that happens around us and to us. The \\"sense\\" of things is of course there to begin with. By trying to \\"apply sense\\" to them, that is, to make our own sense of them we might be not seeing them for what they really are.<BR>    The Stranger is a person who is literally watching his own life unfold without taking any passionate or particular emotional interest in it. It is as if he is having a peculiar out of body experience without being in a trance.<BR>    Many of the people who've read this book find it absurd (as is evident by the reviews of it here in Amazon as well). That's because they do what i mentioned above, they try to apply their own sense to it, and that is the real absurdity.<BR>    Life is not one path and it's not monodimensional. The \\"logic\\" that one person applies might be sheer madness for the next and so on. Camous's hero is a person detached from his surroundings. He finds it hard to understand why some people think this or the other thing, he finds it equally hard to share emotions that qualify as \\"normal\\". He is comfortable in his own world of indifference and becomes uncomfortable when the worlds of others interfere with his. That's what he is or how he is.<BR>   <BR> When the Stranger becomes a murderer it really comes as no surprise really considering the process via which this happens. Anything could happen to him as he doesn't resist the flow of things, he avoids friction and paradoxically this avoidance of friction that he so intensely pursues leads him to direct confrontation with his environment because of his crime. And this crime is dealt with by the Stranger the same way he's dealt with everything else: he is a spectator of that too.<BR>    Camous uses the trial of the Stranger brilliantly. The trial is of course nothing more than a platform the author utilises to bring across a clearer image of the Stranger. And as the final curtain is about to fall the reader is subjected to a very controversial view of the world. Which is? It's just \\"let me be\\"...<BR>    <BR>    I think that the reason The Stranger maintains its charm and importance even today (which means that it still touches the pulse of the times) is exactly because our societies are increasingly becoming full of Strangers, full of Spectators, and those who deny it should be accused of hypocrisy. This is not accidental. And, exactly because it is NOT accidental this book remains as important as the day it was first published. Why are we like this? Why have we become what we've become? Is this really our potential? Indifference? Is this all?<BR>   <BR>     Existentialist rhetoric and questions some might say. True, but defining our existence is something most of us are not  good at. The questions might be old but they haven't been answered, not in the past 50 years, not in the past 20 centuries. The Stranger asks them too. He's not the only one.
0316666343|2.0|The opening really made me want to read the book--it was edgy and well-written (and as to the complaints of its being grisly, well, of course it's grisly.  It's about murder!).  But I became increasingly disappointed as I kept reading.  The writing degenerated into sentimental mush and got preachy and extremely strange at the end.  Integrity was sacrificed for a happy ending.  Very disappointing.
0780626966|5.0|... but I'll go for it anyway. I completely agree with the many reviewers who proclaim this collection as the best DVD boxed set available. While I don't really care as much for part 5 or 6, the first four films are absolute classics (yes, even the underappreciated second film), and New Nightmare is decent. The original A Nightmare on Elm Street ranks among the greatest horror films ever made, and Freddy is a horror icon without peer. The extra disc is packed with extra material, and the interactive labrynth is a very cool idea. They don't make 'em like this anymore!
0375707972|5.0|My Mum advised me to read this book and I did, and was more than pleasantly surprised. What a masterpiece! I didn't know what it would be about, as I hadn't read any reviews at all. I didn't even know it would be a book about the Holocaust... but it is also a book about a complicated and tortured relationship between an adolescent and a mature woman. Her crimes are well-defined and as I read on I hated her more and more, not only for what she did during the War, but also for how she treated Michael. I couldn't really work out what his crime was, and why he thought he'd betrayed her, and why he was beating himself up so much. I think she made him totally neurotic. If my own son was underage and got into a relationship like that, I'd probably kill the woman. She basically destroyed him the way she destroyed so many other innocent people before him. I felt like crying for Michael, but I didn't feel one bit sorry for her and was glad when she had the wisdom to do what she did in the end.
B000002J1F|4.0|Whenever most people mention prog rock, you can get weird looks and it is understandable to a degree -- it takes more than a passing interest in music and a little patience to dig into the headier symphonic jazz fusion 'thinking man rock' found within that genre; it is not a genre known for its accessibility.<BR>But if any group can be both listenable and retain its prog rep, its YES. And on Fragile, the band combine stellar playing and complex arrangements with catchy riffs and singable passages.<BR>The album marks the debut of keyboard caped wonder Rick Wakeman. His ease with a various array of keys brought a new canvas of sounds for YES to play against, and the combination works well, like on the hit Roundabout, or on the album's grand opus Heart Of the Sunrise. South Side Of the Sky is a rocker that features a quieter middle section that sounds as if it could have been clipped from an ELP album.<BR>The band continue to build inviting vocal harmonies atop their musical landscapes, led by singer/lyricist Jon Anderson, who was also beginning to truly find himself as a writer here as he paints abstract stream of consiousness phrases that roll and weave their way into your ears without much need of ever really knowing what it all means.<BR>The other members are all tremendously talented at their respected instruments, and they know it; each band member is given a slot to showcase his particular gifts. An indication of artistic merit, or ego? <BR>No matter -- this disc is a classic, and while it isn't as cohesive as its follow-up Close To the Edge, it offers a good starting point for those interested in the band.
B00006AFUR|5.0|After years of study scientist were astonished to discover a new breed of entertainer: the actor turned musician that doesn't stink to high heaven.<br />30 Seconds To Mars is the project of vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Jared Leto (the guy with the cornrows in Panic Room) and his brother Shannon, who provides the drums.  Their self-titled debut album is quite impressive, exceeding expectations not only by the standards of thespian vanity projects, but also those of modern rock in general.<br />Musically, 30STM draw a heavy influence from classic prog rock bands like Pink Floyd, but the Letos have thrown in a healthy dose of synth-rock in the vein of Deadsy (whose synth player, Dr. Nner, contributes his skill to the opening track).  Lyrically, they are even closer to prog, with songs that on the surface are about living in space, but have an underlying message that can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on the listener (a quality that Jared admits is intentional).  If you're looking for something different, you've definately found it.<br />One thing's for sure: these guys DEFINITELY aren't Dogstar.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble was born to sings these songs.

B00007KWHN|4.0|YES proved with The Yes Album that third time is truly the charm. They had already released two modest efforts prior to this disc, but those were missing the guitar prowess of Steve Howe. With the key contributors to YES in place now -- vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire and Howe -- the band were set to lay down some great prog rock. Even if you don't like prog, you will find something to dig about this disc. YES manage to create music that is complex yet accessible, quirky yet listenable, unified yet versatile. It has a warmth and melodious quality that is sometimes absent from prog rock. <BR>The album kicks off with Yours Is No Disgrace, an anti-war song without all the hippy psychedelics. Other highlights are Starship Trooper, Howe's first guitar classic called Clap (not THE Clap, as some album liner notes have mistakenly listed it in the past), the hit I've Seen All Good People, with its great jam, and the fan fave Perpetual Change.<BR>The band also try and balance strong music with strong vocals. Here, Jon Anderson provides most of the vocals (including backing vocal overdubs) as Howe and Squire provide some backing of their own. <BR>YES infuse elements of folk, rock, jazz, country, and classical structures into an album that would go on to be the first in a set of albums the band would be best known for (Fragile and Close To the Edge being the other two). This is the first in the Holy Trinity of classic YES discs, and is excellent listening.<BR>As for the bonus tracks, if you don't own this disc, its a nice addition, but if you already have this disc, I don't know if it's worth buying again.
B00005JLXC|5.0|With the New Year's arrival, there was bound to be a new comic book movie. Luckily for us, Daredevil has taken the spot. Upon its release people often wondered, could it take the place of Spiderman? The answer is most certainly yes and it has proven to live up to Marvel's reputation for making great movies. Daredevil presents an amazing display of animation and as well as superb acting to make it an overall stellar movie. Besides that, viewers can be awestruck by its touching story line. The story begins with 12 year old Matt Murdock, portrayed by Ben Aflek, losing his vision. From this he gains a super strength in his remaining four senses as well as a sonar type vision. After being harassed and bullied by other children in the area he begins to hone his skills and becomes extremely strong. Shortly after this after a boxing fight, an event occurs that will forever change his life. Next thing you know, Murdock is posing as a poorly paid attorney by day and super hero Daredevil by night. As the hero he watches over the city and commits acts of violence against those who deserve it.  Later on he becomes involved in fighting with crime-lord Kingpin, actor Michael Duncan and his deadly assassin Bullseye. Bullseye who is portrayed by Colin Farrell has the ability to accurately throw anything precisely such as darts, paper clips, and pencils all of which he uses to kill.  Alongside of Daredevil, whether she knows it or not, is the attractive Elektra played by Jennifer Garner. Elektra's idea for revenge is because of several unnerving deaths in her family. The animation shown in Daredevil is almost frightening, it's that good. When Murdock uses his sonar vision to see Elektra for the first time you can almost feel the emotion. Besides that, the acting portrayed by all of the main characters in the story is remarkable. In the final fight scenes the viewer will most certainly be awestruck. The actors that were chose for their parts proved to all be perfect matches. Althoughsome of the movie seemed to be far fetched it is important that you realize it is based on comic book. Overall, the movie seemed to have a touching story line and great acting. If you have the chance to see it, you would be a fool to pass it up.
B00008HCCF|5.0|I bought this DVD the day after Norah Jones swept the Grammys, and I wasn't sure what to expect.  As a performer she is talented and warm, but refreshingly reserved.  Unlike most celebrities who use their moments in the spotlight, Miss Jones seems intent on keeping herself to, well, herself.  Good for her.<br />She's got talent, poise, and she's easy on the eyes. Original songs will come in time, and if she continues doing excellent covers, great. (Personally, I'd like to hear her version of Peggy Lee's &quot;Fever.&quot;) I was impressed by her band as well - especially the lead guitarist.  The DVD is well done, spare on the features, and sound quality is better than average.
B000084T18|5.0|\\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is a contemplation of rough ghetto life from beginning to end, but it's also laced with the pop sensibilities that put album co-producers Dr. Dre and Eminem at the top of their genres, which is exactly what this album should prove to do to 50 Cent.  There are tracks like \\"What Up Gangsta\\", \\"Heat\\", and \\"Don't Push Me\\", which are filled with the usual hardcore rap chatter, however 50's delivery is solid and places him above those who may rival him lyrically.  The first single, \\"In Da Club\\", along with \\"PIMP\\" and \\"If I Can't\\" are the album's \\"fun\\" songs, however they do not disrupt the integrity or the flow of the album as a whole.  While still providing controversy in the form of the Ja Rule/Murder Inc. diss \\"Back Down\\",  50 proves he can be more introspective on tracks like thuggish love song \\"21 Questions\\" and \\"Many Men\\", which is a song about a man struggling to keep his faith in God in an increasingly virulent world.  Powerful guest appearances by G-Unit soldiers Young Buck, Tony Yayo, and Lloyd Banks, as well as Eminem and West Coast crooner Nate Dogg make the album complete, and without the use of gratuitous skits and noise making, as has become so common in rap today.  \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is here, and has affirmed 50 Cent as one of the most essential performers in the industry.
B00004U2G4|5.0|One of the best albums made., right next to Jimi Hendrix's Electricladyland(and everything Jimi did frankly was incredible., he's the true KING) as great as Zeps first The Cream Terry Reid.,Let it Bleed. Its a perfect album straight through that sounds as good now as ever. A incredible line-up, this was when Rod was Hot Rod. I saw them play at the singer bowl with 10 Years After then Jeff Beck Group and 10 Years after jammed and Led Zeppelin came on stage and they all did Jailhouse Rock.., it was amazing! Then Robert Plant pulled down his pants and the management pulled the plug and the lights went out! BOOO!<BR>Then Vanilla Fudge came on as everyone was leaving., how could you follow that Super jam.., I heard as we left.., go ahead people leave were gonna play anyway! Sorry Felix<BR>GET TRUTH!<BR>Beck is THE BEST!<BR>Get Beckola too!
B00000IAU3|5.0|An interesting album with a dark feel to it. Her voice never lets that darkness become overpowering or depressing. This one is definitely not the standard pop the record companies are pushing lately.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is a thrilling movie about Shelby Leonard, a widower who cannot form new memories. Shelby is on a quest to avenge the assult on his wife that killed her. This is one of those movies that did not do too well in theaters, but word of mouth has spread making this movie a must see. This is one of those movies you have to watch again when you finish it, understanding the little details which eluded you before. Without giving any more of the movie away, I can only say you need to watch it. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give great performances
B000069CWE|5.0|First off, let me say that I am a big Linkin Park fan and have been since there first album.  Now, to the point.  THIS CD IS EXCELLENT! In my opinion the best tracks would be &quot;Pushing me Away&quot;, &quot;With You&quot;,&quot;My December&quot;,&quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;Krawling&quot;.  The only songs and this CD that I wasn't impressed with were &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;X-ecutioner Style&quot; but the rest of the tracks on the CD easily redeem it back to 5 stars.  I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO EVERY LINKIN PARK FAN.

You will find reload as well as load and all of the rest of metallica's realeses highly disapointing! I consider metallica one of the most talented bands to ever come out , if not the most talented band to ever come out !Now, i happen to find \\"reload\\"  very boring,slow,and,unoriginal... On the song \\"sad but true\\" you can listing to the lirycs and metallica is basically sayng that they don't care any more  which to me is quite obvious because the only  have been realising lately albums that they think will sell and not  playing what metallica is suppost play which is 80's style metal! Metallica's recent sound is boring to death and i can't stand their lirycs let along the sound! Its awful! I been a fan of them and now im not! Metallica is only putting out songs that already been done   and when they do realese albums ? its either another sound... Not the metallica sound or they work with rappers which  in my opinion its something a once respected metal band should never , ever do! Selling out ? i think yes! I realy would rather not say that but metallica isn't giving me a reason not to... So sell outs!!!! If you a fan  of metallica's earliers work you will find reload awful but if you are a fan of horrible bands like creed,staind,pearl jam, limp bizkit,paparoach,and others... You will love metallica's \\"reload\\" I asure!  Laters !!!
B00005O3VC|5.0|BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!  AAAHHAAAHAAAA HAAAA!! HEEEHEEE HEEEHEEE!<br />(If you've never experiened an unbridled reaction of this kind to absurd comedy, brilliant slapstick, or general silliness, then you will never like this movie. Your life will be devoid of humor ever after and will no longer have any meaning. Move along.)<br />If you have, and delight in the antics of the Pythons, you will not be disappointed. It's a wonderfully restored, remastered, re-whatevered DVD. I loved to hear the actors and directors still genuinely laughing -- after all these years -- on the commentary tracks. This movie stands the test of time as a comedic masterpiece.<br />And the extras are outstanding -- down to the nostalgic documentary with Terry Jones and Michael Palin as they retrace their steps to the Scottish locations where they made film history 30 years ago.
B00003CX8J|1.0|X-men the movie is NOTHING like the comic books. While there were changes made for the screen, most of them were for the worst. In the comics the X-men had tight, character driven stories, the screenplay for this movie is juat a bunch of jumbled scenes thrown together. While there are some good casting moves (Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian Mckellen are wonderful in their roles) we rarely get to see ANY OF THE CAST DO ANYTHING  EXCEPT pot and spout cliches with the exception of Hugh Jackman who gets way too much screen time. Characters we've all grown to care about-Cyclops(underused), Storm(who has an on again off again African accent), Rogue(too young) and Jean Grey(wooden) have nonexistent roles. The villans are also pretty useless in this movie too. Mystique has no story, sabretooth no personality and toad is just a spit and tongue gimmick. The years of depth and caracter development of the comic characters are sacrificed for the sake of idiotic stunts and special effects. Rent it, don't buy it because this movie was made for diehard fanboys only. If you want to know who the X-men REALLY are check out \\"Essential X-men\\" volume I and II on sale in the books section.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u. is a very unique duo. Their voices are different from the rest of the music today and that is great. Lena and Julia (the girls of t.A.T.u.) are truly talented and are not just studio creations. The first U.S. released single &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; is the best song on the album. The rest of the songs including &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; and &quot;Clowns&quot; shows their unique voices. This is a must for any music collector. Don't let their image fool you (although there is nothing wrong with their image), these girls are very talented and deservce to have their CD in your collection.
B000000WGL|3.0|I think this album has one great song on it. Where are the great melodies? It's just a bunch of riffs! That one great song is the duet he does with Sara Dash. It is beautiful! I couldn't get into anything else. Give me any Stones album anyday over this(except the ones after 1980.) I just thought it was boring.

014028009X|5.0|Poor Bridget, just can't seem to get any aspect of life right.  Yet we as readers can't help but love her, mainly I think, because no matter how bad your life is, reading this book will make you feel better.  You'll be laughing out loud at the predicaments Bridget manages to get herself into as well as the lunacy of some of the colorful characters in her life.  Fielding's story is so effective because it's, unfortunately, universal.  Most of us women can relate to Bridget's neurotic thought patterns, but what's great about this book is that, just when you think you know which way the downward spiral of her life is going, the story manages to surprise the reader with its tale.  Read this book- you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be uplifted!
B0000524CY|3.0|How can someone find this movie 'too scary to watch'? I've read this a couple of times; and that really amazes me. The Exorcist is an entertaining, interesting movie, but not scary. I even consider it to be drama, not horror. What's there to be so incredibly scared about? Some parts that are supposed to be scary were making me laugh, like all the insults the young girl throws at the priest and the part where she throws up (just a really fake looking green soup spraying out of her mouth) and spits (an orange goo) in the priest's face. I was really amazed that this movie didn't scare me because of it's reputation. I've seen it 3 times but I never got that creepy feeling that horrorfilms are supposed to give you.
B000063UR2|5.0|I've seen all the various versions of Legend. UK release, US release and now The Ultimate Edition. My first viewing of Legend was the US release. At the time I was struck by the sets, costumes, cinematography and individual performances in the film. Still I found the film to be a messterpeice. (A film that is a complete mess with moments of dazzling brilliance) For some reason I kept going back and viewing the film. With each viewing I found the film more hypnotic. The Ultimate Edition, which features the Original Jerry Goldsmith score, along with restored footage and dialogue, laid to rest once and for all my misgivings about the film. Legend is a visionary film. Ridley Scott's inspiration for Legend was Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. Scott has even said he originally had intended for Mia Sara's Princess to turn into a cat like creature after succumbing to temptation. Mia Sara, in her first film role, gives a star turning performance as the young girl whose blossoming sexuality both tempts and beguiles everyone who comes in touch with her, including Tim Curry's Darkness. The scenes between Tim Curry (Barely recognizable under Rob Bottin's incredible make up job) and Mia Sara are among the best in the film. Legend is a picture book fairy tale brought magnificently to life.<br />Preston McClear...
B000002C1V|5.0|Some people don't and won't get this album.  These people are probably the ones that ding Roger Waters' solo career post-Pink, showing their ignorance as to the true creative GENIUS behind the late-great Pink Floyd.<br />There is criticism that the cuts on this album are \\"rejects\\" from \\"The Wall\\".  I guess the question these people haven't pondered is \\"why?\\" these tracks were \\"rejected\\".  I would put forward that these tracks were \\"not commercial\\" enough and detracted from the overall, and extremely powerful, direction and experience of \\"The Wall\\".  <br />This album is also extremely morose and even starker than \\"The Wall\\", leaving me to think that these were the songs in \\"Pink's\\" songbook when he was sitting on the floor next to the toilet in the bathroom stall before the trial sequence in \\"The Wall\\".<br />\\"The Final Cut\\" is one of my favorite Pink Floyd albums, even though one could argue it was Roger Waters' first solo album since the rest of Pink Floyd were at odds with Waters during the entire recording process.  One could even argue, and rather successfully, that \\"The Wall\\" was ostensibly a Roger Waters solo effort, with some wonderful and talented backing rendered by Gilmour and the rest of Pink Floyd and classical session musicians.<br />Since it has been twenty years since the release of \\"The Final Cut\\" we can take a look at the arcs of the Gilmour-led, pseudo-Pink Floyd (lawyers winning the right to use the name isn't the same as being what the name signified) and Waters solo.  Taking their works post-Pink, it is madness to not see that Gilmour is extremely TALENTED, but Waters' is the true GENIUS.<br />As the PA ghostly blasted to an emptying Shoreline Amphitheater after a Roger Waters solo concert, \\"Who's the REAL Pink?\\"<br />Yeah, that's what I thought....<br />Enjoy the GENIUS of Roger Waters and \\"The Final Cut\\" created during the same manic flow that birthed \\"The Wall\\".
B00005JLEU|5.0|I waited and waited to see this film when it was released here in the states. I finally managed to find one theater which was playing the film near me. (If you call traveling 100 miles near me) I saw it on the last night of it's run at the theater. I was thrilled afterwards that I was able to see Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi before the film dissappeared. Shame on Disney for not doing more promotion for this film. Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi was the highest grossing film in Japanese history, making even more money than Titanic. Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi is the story of a little girl named Chihiro who stumbles on an empty amusement park with her parents. When her parents take food which doesn't belong to them from a vendor stand, they are turned into pigs. Chihiro quickly finds out the amusement park is really a spa for Japanese spirits. She is forced into slavery and must work in a bath house run by a witch named Yubaba. During the course of the film Chihiro goes through a journey of self discovery and learns valuable lessons about respect, honor and self reliance. It is only after learning these lessons that Chihiro is able to free her parents and herself. The animation is a stunning combination of hand drawn images and computer animation. Don't miss this film when it is released here in the states on DVD.<br />Preston McClear, author The Boy Under the Bed
0345349571|5.0|Tuchman's A Distant Mirror is not only a wonderful historical book, it is a work of art.  Tuchman avoided the dryness and lack of &quot;reality&quot; that is common to many historical books that merely list past events and describe them from the author's vantage.  By contrast, she used historical events and setting, and related what actually happened through the thoughts and [probably] spoken words of those alive at that moment in time. She humanizes history. Of course she did not have actual transcripts from the 14th century, but with great skill and eloquence she puts words, thoughts, and feelings into actual principles of history that she skillfully brings alive.  This is not a historical novel in any traditional sense.  Rather, I'd say, it's a factual description of the 14th century, as felt and lived by actual people of the time.  In fact I believe A Distant Mirror is the first acclaimed book of this type that most historians acclaim as very worthy.  It's a must-read for all who are interested in medieval times, especially, medieval France.  It's very hard to put down, once started.
B000002J03|5.0|Buy this album if only for the incredible bass playing of Mr. John Paul Jones, His work on the Lemon Song is phenomenal.
B00008HCCF|5.0|If you like Norah Jones, you will love this DVD.  There are several songs on this DVD that aren't on her latest CD, such as Comes Love, Something is Calling You, What Am I to You, Bessie Smith, and Tennessee Waltz (which is only available from the Bonus Features section).  The DVD has Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2 channel sound as the options.  The sound and video are very good, about the same quality as some of the better MTV Unplugged DVD's (excluding the Eagles Hell Freezes Over).  The video is full screen and is very sharp and clear, with a lot of close-ups of Norah.  My only complaint is that's it's rather short at only 67 minutes, I wish she would've added a few more tracks from some of her other live performances.
B00007JMCX|4.0|Time for me (and you) to bury the rancid turkey that Fox Lorber issued a few years ago. This is the edition to buy. The film looks fantastic...Anamorphic Widesceen!! Great sound, and a very good movie indeed. My reservations, meaning a docked star, are with the thin smattering of extras, necessitating a second disc, and the flimsy packaging that will fall to pieces if you watch this as compulsively as you ought. These quibbles aside, the price is right, and hats off again to Anchor Bay for taking a punt on this film
0141301155|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory<br /> The book I read was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. The year it was published was in 1964. The main characters are Charlie Bucket, Grandpa Joe, Agustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, and Mike Teavee. This book is about Charlie Bucket who wants to get a golden ticket in a Wonka bar so that he and four other children can go inside Wonka's factory. Unfortunatly, he can't even afford a candy bar! So one day when he was walking down the street he found some money in a gutter, which was enough to buy a candy bar! So he bought a Wonka bar and what was inside? A golden ticket! This was the last golden ticket. Now he gets to go inside Wonka's factory! The moral of the story is to live your dreams and don't give up. Charlie learns that being spoiled gets you nowhere, because all the other children get such as shrunk or sucked up a pipe. Charlie changes because he gets to own a big chocolate factory in the end. I gave this book a five out of five.
B00005JLXC|3.0|If the entire run of Daredevil comics is viewed as a grocery store, this movie consists of a shopping trip where the sweetest, juiciest offerings are snapped up and tossed into the cart with little regard for how they will complement each other.<br />Everybody in the movie does a pretty good job, and you get a sense that this film was made by people who really liked the character and wanted to make the coolest Daredevil movie possible. Very little of the origin story is changed, and the loss of the heroic feat that resulted in young Matt Murdock's blindness is quickly compensated for by the good boy behavior he exhibits as he learns to make his way in a dark world of overwhelming sounds, smells, touches, and tastes.<br />Most people probably don't notice that 3/4 of the movie is a flashback--the \\"life passing before my eyes\\" framework is quickly forgotten as we're captivated by Matt's tragic tale. I really would have preferred the sort of origin story that Miller presented in the comics series when Ben Urich discovered Daredevil's identity, but this approach was serviceable.<br />And that's my real problem with the movie: the highlights are great--special moments that any DD fan will be familiar with--but they're pasted together with a lot of \\"serviceable\\" material that just barely bridges the gaps.<br />The casting is solid, but not incredible. Colin Farrell is great as Bullseye, Jon Favreau is an ideal Foggy Nelson, and Joe Pantoliano does nicely with a not-very-special version of Ben Urich. Ben Affleck is, well, serviceable, and Jennifer Garner, while delightful to look at, is sadly miscast as Elektra Natchios, who was always depicted in the comics as much more mysterious and exotic: Garner's just too whitebread for the role. Michael Clarke Duncan seems to have taken the spirit of the Kingpin to heart, but his clumsy handling of almost every prop they put in his hands (and he's always holding something) makes this great, mountainous, powerful figure look a bit hesitant and shaky.<br />A lot of this movie works very, very well, and there are some magnificent moments that are right up there with the best the movie superhero genre has to offer. Overall, though, it doesn't quite hold together. A notch below X-MEN, two notches below SPIDER-MAN, but, fortunately, good enough to wash away the taste of the wretched \\"Trial of the Incredible Hulk,\\" which introduced Daredevil to TV audiences back in the 80s.<br />Hm. Maybe if I go back and watch Rex Smith as Daredevil, I'll appreciate Ben Affleck more...
B00003XB8K|5.0|Most artists seem to go downhill as they crank out their second, third albums...but Engima has managed to improve, if anything, as they continue to produce an alluring mix of new age and techno with their fourth masterpiece.<br />The music arrangements alone are fantastic...everything works together and links to itself in the typical Enigma fashion...there are no breaks in between the tracks which only adds to the flavour of this album. Once you take into account the beautiful lyrics and enchanting vocals, it's obvious that topping this creation would be a challenge indeed.<br />While listening to the enigmatic (no pun intended) songs, it's almost impossible to escape a transportation to a more peaceful and loving world...it seems that Engima can bring peace to a listener in both physical and emotional states.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I'm one of those guys who memorized 'Loser' when it came out, tried to memorize 'Jack Ass' and then eventually decided I liked 'Mutations' after all.  By now you may know that Sea Change isn't one of the sooper groovy albums, it's mellow.<br />For this listening experience, you're going to want to have some relaxing tea... or a glass of vodka, and lay on the couch with someone you really like a lot.  By the time, 'Lost Cause' hits, she/he should be snuggled up in your lap, and you should try vocalizing the chorus.  The rest of the disc just keeps on being good, and so too should your evening.<br />I liked Sea Change right away, and also use it to keep help eliminate road rage on the highways.  It's just that good.
0780619587|5.0|Shine is about dreams, love, failure and success. Young David Helfgott wants to go abroad to study piano and take advantage of a grant he's offered against his father's wishes. The emotional stress ends up crippling his dreams of becoming a famous pianist and spending a good part of his life in a mental institution. This movie is filled with magical scenes with subtle messages like the one where the David's father goes to see him after many years and talks very casually and almost apologetic about trivial things and then leaves as we see him walk down the wet dark streets below from David's point of view. The father's message: &quot;I'm sorry son&quot; and all the images-the wet streets(=tears), the fact that is nighttime (shades of blue- blue means trust, frienship) is all to symbolize the sadness and the love that David's father feels inside but is unable to express verbally to his son. It's a powerfull scene and althought there are no tears on screen the viewer of this movie will provide his own. Shine is great film that takes a different path and stays away from the Holywood formula. Geoffry Rush plays Helfgott as an adult and you should see Rush's work in &quot;Quills&quot; playing opposite Joaquim Phoenix who's one the besy up and coming actors today, and who plays Comodus in the Academy award winning movie &quot;Gladiator&quot;.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|The cd 200 km/h in the wrong lane is an exalent cd. My 2 personal favorits is \\"all the this she said\\" & \\"how soon is now\\"!

It inspires them to be Proud and Belive in what and who they are!
6305922756|5.0|Christopher Guest is a comic genius. If you haven't seen any of his satirical, psuedo-documentary films and you want a starting place, This Is Spinal Tap is where to begin. The cast is perfect. Every character is strategically placed to spoof a particular element of the rock industry. Spinal Tap is like a perfect, feature length, Saturday Night Live skit. Any fan of this type of comedy, or of Christopher Guest will love this classic film. Also check out Waiting For Guffman, and Best In Show, both by Guest. Pure comedy.
0066214122|3.0|In Prey, Crichton uses primarily the same formula that he did in Jurassic Park and Timeline.  Replace dinosaurs and Medieval horrors with nanoparticles, and you have Prey.  That is not such a bad thing.  All three of these novels will keep you up late at night trying to get to the resolution of some very exciting sequences.<br /><br />The resolution in Prey does seem a little flat though.  The climax of prey is filled with as much intensity as any of his novels, but the denouement (falling action after the climax) is weak at best.  When you hit the last page, you find yourself wondering why he would end the story at that moment. There is still a little left to be resolved.<br /><br />I was also a little put off by the main character.  We are supposed to see him as being intellectual and yet some very obvious details and clues slip right past him.  At times he is passive to the point of absurdity and other times he is a determined leader.  Crichton's characters tend to be a little flat.  He is usually more concerned with providing background details than he is with developing characters.<br /><br />Having said this, Prey is a fun read.  Crichton's stories hold your attention, and like his books from the past, this one keeps you reading.
0783228317|3.0|This film was a disappointment. I like Terry Gilliam's past work. `12 Monkeys' was a great movie, and `Brazil' is in my top five all time. I also like Johnny Depp. He is great in almost every role he takes. Unfortunately the combination of Gilliam, and Depp did not deliver in `Fear and Loathing'. I'm not sure exactly if it was the story, or the directing, or both, but the movie seemed pretty pointless, and convoluted. I was able to pull a couple redeeming messages from the film though. The downfalls of searching for salvation in drugs was clear. And the superficial nature of modern American materialism also crept in. But I can think of better ways to convey these messages than two hours of rambling, vomiting, hallucinating, nonsense. Overall the movie gets three out of five stars based simply on the reputations of the cast, and the director. While poorly conveyed, the messages of the film also helped keep `Fear and Loathing' from earning only one star. I would recommend this film only to die hard Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, or Terry Gilliam fans, or people who are in an ether, and acid induced haze while watching.
B00005JLO2|5.0|&quot;The Four Feathers&quot; is easily the most underrated film of 2002.  The film is a rolicking adventure from beginning to ending, but its epic battle sequences and action moments don't hamper a story that covers such diverse and emotional themes as friendship, duty, honor, redemption, and love. Ledger gives the best performance of his career thus far, while supporting players Bentley and Hudson do amazing things with the time that is given them. The real gem of the film, though, is Djimon Hounsou, who plays Ledger's &quot;guardian angel.&quot; If you haven't seen this film, see it immediately. You'll not regret it.

B000001GPX|5.0|I have loved these recordings for years.  Carlos Kleiber is without question the greatest interpreter of Beethoven orchestral works on the planet.  I just wish he was more ambitious with his Beethoven repertoir. His German bloodline (father was that historic maestro, Erich Kleiber) mixed with culture of his South American upbringing breeds an incredible combination of power and fire.  I have to believe that Beethoven himself would have annointed Kleiber as Numero Uno. If you only have one recording of these two symphonies, these are the ones to own.
B00000064G|5.0|If one were to write a biography of my life, it would be best separated into two parts.  Before Nick Drake and After Nick Drake.  When I stumbled upon an old vinyl in my parents' huge record collection with the funny painting on the front, I was in 8th grade.  I had no idea what to expect, so, like most of my forays into music, I simply placed the record on my dad's stereo and set it turning.  Upon hearing the first chord, I was mesmerized.  It was like a revelation.  I finally understood why we humans assign so much of our life and emotions to the casual vibrations of sound that rise together, merge, and become music amidst the cacophony of modern life.  I remember coming out of a deep reverie as the last notes of &quot;From the Morning&quot; played at my ears and jarring myself upstairs to find my mother to tell me who this incredible man is and if he had more records that I could listen to.  I was so surprised to find out that my mother had never actually listened to it and that it had been a gift from one of her friends who lived in Manchester.  I was bowled over and made her sit down with me as we listened to the record.  She had the exact same reaction to the music as I did and we decided to buy more of his albums (sadly, only two others existed that had been released in his lifetime.)  Needless to say, here I am, a freshman in college and, yes, I am listening to Nick Drake as I type this.  I could enumerate at least 15 changes in my personality after I began to listen to Nick Drake.  His effect at least on me has been substantial.  Who knew that someone could say so much and radically alter others perception of the world around them with only a mere 30 minute collection of 11 songs?  He speaks to me across the gap of 25-30 years as he will speak to you if you only listen.  Songs like &quot;Things Behind the Sun&quot; and &quot;Parasite&quot; have something totally indescribable that makes your breath catch in your throat as you agonize over the beauty of their haunting lyrics.  &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, &quot;Place to Be&quot;, and &quot;Which Will&quot; all are songs whose hidden meanings will destroy you once you realize what they are trying to say while &quot;Harvest Breed&quot; and &quot;From the Morning&quot; will leave you with an incredible hope for life and the future.  In this day and age of flashy and poppy songs that are mass-produced for a public that is, by-and-large, ignorant of true art and the true artists of the world, Nick Drake offers a refuge in his deceptively simple melodies that draw from your soul everything that music was meant to.  This is possibly the most beautiful album ever made.
B00005B36H|5.0|I may venture to call this heavy metal's \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" You have to listen to this album many times to take in all of its beauty.  If Tool continues with their tradition of each of their albums blowing the previous one away I can't even imagine what the next could be like.<br />Tool gets a bad rap automatically these days because they get played on alternative radio next to [bands]like Linkin Park and Drowning Pool.  Tool is much closer to art/progressive rock gods like Pink Floyd or King Crimson than any modern metal.  As genius Trent Reznor stated, if Tool was just starting up today in this cespool of musical excrement (as opposed to the early 90's when metal and grunge were good) and record labels that only want money, they would never get signed and an album like Lateralus could never get played anywhere.

Songs like &quot;Things Behind the Sun&quot; and &quot;Parasite&quot; have something totally indescribable that makes your breath catch in your throat as you agonize over the beauty of their haunting lyrics. &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, &quot;Place to Be&quot;, and &quot;Which Will&quot; all are songs whose hidden meanings will destroy you once you realize what they are trying to say while &quot;Harvest Breed&quot; and &quot;From the Morning&quot; will leave you with an incredible hope for life and the future. In this day and age of flashy and poppy songs that are mass-produced for a public that is, by-and-large, ignorant of true art and the true artists of the world, Nick Drake offers a refuge in his deceptively simple melodies that draw from your soul everything that music was meant to. This is possibly the most beautiful album ever made.

This cd is one of their best man!All the songs are new and fresh and they rock. Espacially &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot; &quot;The God That Failed&quot; &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot;. Nothing Else Matters is soo so good. Its so classical and deep, the solo is amazing and James' vocals move me. Aight all you TallicaJunkies if u haven't already, BUY this album!!           while your at it pick up some primus.   keep rockin
0440217563|5.0|The story: Claire finds out that Jamie survived the Battle of Culloden and knows she must join him back in the past. She makes peace with her daughter Brianna, ties up loose ends back at the hospital in Boston, and then returns to Scotland to make the journey through time to 1768, Scotland. Once she gets back to 18th century Scotland, she and Jamie have a few days together and then the adventure begins. <BR>     Jamie's nephew, Ian, gets kidnapped by pirates, and Jamie and Claire must sail to the West Indies to find him. Their journey is exciting and frought with peril. The re-joining of Jamie and Claire does not dissapoint.<BR>     This book also tells the tale of what happened to Jamie after the Battle of Culloden. It is a tale of such loneliness and tragedy that it will break your heart! It also tells of what happened to Claire after she reappeared in Scotland in 1948 after being gone for 3 years, and her life with Frank and Brianna.<br />     This book kinda plays \\"catch up\\" for the first few hundred pages. This part of the book is very good, but it does not have the insomnia inducing, page turning qualitites of the first two books. THEN...you get to the adventure once again. Once Claire gets back to Jamie, the story speeds up with a vengence. I mean, come on, arson, sabotage, kidnapping, pirates, voo doo, and hurricanes...what more can you ask for? <BR>     This book focuses less on the love story, and more on adventure and story-telling. Alot can be learned about Jamie and Claire from the tales of the 18 years they were apart.  Another great part of this book, is seeing the beginnings of the relationship between Roger and Brianna. Make sure, you have Drums of Autumn handy because after finishing this one, you will not want to wait to start the next one!<br />JBogue<BR>paper-and-lace<BR>Specializing in paranormal romance and fiction.
B00006SFBD|3.0|I've given this one about 30 spins or so, and it's starting to grow on me.  Still, I look at this as a step backward from the brilliant &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;.<br />My first listen invoked the same feelings I had when I first heard Metallica's self-titled album.  I'm not saying that Opeth sold out, got old, or even worse...worked with Bob Rock.  I'm saying that the songs lacked the musical complexity of their previous works (longer stretches with one riff, fewer time changes, etc.), and that even the lyrics seemed a little weak(the beginning of &quot;A Fair Judgement&quot; in particular).  While, any other band should strive to be this good, Opeth has proven that they are far better.<br />On this disc, &quot;Master's Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Deliverance&quot; are the standout tracks.  For new listeners, I'd recommend that you start with &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; or &quot;Morningrise&quot; before picking up this one.
044022425X|5.0|The story: Jamie and Claire are together and must carve out a life for themselves in America. After reviewing their options they decide to settle in North Carolina. Here they must struggle to set up shelter for themselves and a few of their friends / family. Word spread of Claire's skill with medicine, and she becomes a well known healer. Jamie is happy with their small but prosperous settlement, but bothered by Claire's tales of the unrest that will follow in the \\"American Revolution.\\"<BR>     Brianna and Roger are just beginning their lives together, and then Brianna finds a news clipping that tells of Jamie and Claire's death. Brianna is torn between her love for Roger and the thought that she might be able to prevent her parent's death. <br />     This book was simply great! As much as I love the setting of Scotland, it is so wonderful to see Jamie and Claire come to America and make a new start. Jamie is now an older and wiser man. But, that does not mean that he does not make mistakes. OH MAN, does he make a whopper of a mistake in this book! <BR>     If you have read they other reviews for this series, by now you know how much I love these books. The story line kind of stalled with the 3rd book, but this book picks the pace up once again. Jamie is the stuff that dreams are made of! This saga is destined to become a classic.<br />JBogue<BR>paper-and-lace<BR>Specializing in paranormal romance and fiction.
0671027344|4.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is one of the best books I have ever read.  <br />A confessional of a boy named Charlie who does not really fit in.  The story covers his freshman year of high school.  Charlie is a likable character, with wisdom beyond his age, who seems to teeter on the knife-edge of depression.  Charlie struggles with the normal hurdles of coming of age: crushes, first dates, discovering sex, drug experimentation, loosing oneself in music, parental strife, dealing with death, and making genuine friends.  <br />He finds solace in two senior friends and a teacher who sees his intuition and intellect.  Charlie does fall into depression toward the end but finds himself again.  I was left with a warm feeling knowing Charlie would be okay in the end.  <br />This book is \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" with a more upbeat ending.   A novel that leaves the reader with the ideal that everyone matters.  If your life isn't going how you planned, it's okay to feel bad about it, even if your problems pale in comparison to the problems of others.  Problems are problems and sadness is sadness and we make it through in the end.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Johnny Cash's new album is much like his previous American albums, mostly covers of other people's songs.  This is a good album, but perhaps the weakest of the 4 album series.<BR>A big part of the reason is that these songs go a little more mainstream than the previous records, and Cash's covers of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's Bridge Over Trouble Water (with Fiona Apple) and his cover of the Beatles' In My Life are really not very good at all.<BR>The rest of the songs though are alll solid.  His version of the traditional Streets of Laredo and his cover of Sting's I Hung my head are excellent songs. The highlights of the album are the first two songs (The Man Comes Around, and Hurt) and then his version of Personal Jesus.<BR>If you liked the previous American recordings, the odds are this one won't disappoint you.
B00005JLXC|1.0|I'm surprised so many people seem to like this movie, or only the ones that like it review it. To start I have never wanted to leave halfway through a movie until this one, it was so boring and predictable I really despised watching it until the end. Also you may start hating the characters and wishing the main characters would die too just to mix it up a little, considering  other people are dropping all over the place. I personally wished at the end of the movie, Michael Duncan had taken both Aflec and Garner and broken them in half and stuffed them in a dumpster, smacked his hands together and said \\"That's business\\", I would have died laughing and it would have been worth it, of course this didn't happen as the superhero a Aflec saves the day.<br />For me the problems started when as a little boy daredevil suddenly does a flash kick (back flip kick) when he's like 12. I couldn't figure out why they would put something like that in the otherwise solid movie so far. I knew it was going to get bad, and it did.  The logic behind his super powers makes no sense at all, why this blind guy can suddenly know how to fight and be a little gay acrobat I don't know. Obviously no one expects realism in a movie like this, but it didn't even have the \\"superhero logic\\" that made sense behind this movie. Here goes a guy goes blind so suddenly he becomes 100 times better than everyone else at everything, ... picking up women, smelling people from across the planet, success in the job market, this guy gets everything just because he goes blind.<br />The relationship between Aflec and Garner was cheesy and both characters seemed unbelievable. The plot is absolutely straight forward and it could be told by a hyper 5 year old going \\"This happened, oh and, then this happened.\\" The plot makes sense but, really there isn't much of a story to tell. The whole thing seemed so cheesy to me. It wasn't cool and it didn't do anything new.<br />If you want an action flick, go see Shangri Knights, its Owen Wilson just cracks up the place, and the whole movie is a blast.  DareDevil = not fun, I don't know what they were going for in DareDevil (besides your money) it's not funny, its not suspenseful, it doesn't make you think, the action isn't great, the characters aren't loveable, its just boring and depressing. They tried to make it all serious and yet how serious can a movie be where everyone suddenly can fly and a blind guy kicks the ... out of everyone.<br />I guess overall I'd say don't see this movie unless you like the idea of Super Disability man being superhuman in all areas above and beyond normal people for no reason at all. If you're ok with that, see the movie, it might be tolorable if you can see past that. But it's still a real snooze, Mike Duncan going around picking people up and throwing them across the screen for 2 hours would be so much better than this. (You only get like 2 minutes of it)
B000002IHD|5.0|Many people know Otis Redding for his biggest hit Dock of the Bay, or perhaps they know that he wrote the Aretha Franklin classic Respect.  These people need to dig deeper into Otis Redding's body of work.<BR>Forget the best of collections, or anything like that.  Unless you are desperate to have Dock of the Bay, Otis Blue is the way to go.  Every song here is a classic. You get Aretha's song Respect, his beautiful covers of My Girl, Wonderful World, and his desperate cover of the Stones' Satisfaction.  There are the sad song, A Change Is Going to come, and the slow love song I've Been Loving You Too Long.  All of these are top notch '60s soul.<BR>This is a must have album for any Redding fan, sould fan, or fans of just good music.
B00006LJ72|1.0|I cannot even begin to explain the dissapointment that I have with this box set.<br />Like a previous review said before me, this is basically a recycled &quot;Box Of Dreams&quot; with a few added tracks and different style packaging. This box set had so much potential to be a wonderful gift but that potential was completely blown by merely including almost all of her regular studio album tracks and still excluding non-album tracks. Each of the four discs has enough space left for several more tracks and the leftover space could've been used to make a separate disc for a B-Sides disc. <br />This is a great box set but Warner Brothers completely blew it with this release!!
0060537639|1.0|It is probable that the Chinese (and the Japanese) sailed the Pacific before Europeans did, so I was interested in reading Gavin Menzies book. Unfortunately, the evidence he has to validate his thesis that great Chinese treasure fleets sailed the world and charted the coasts of America in 1421-23 doesn't stand up. Any attempt to independently check his evidence shows that it is based on old anecdotes, extracts from websites devoted to the paranormal, and so forth. Even his citation of the locations of wreck sites is full of errors and the  wrecks that he cites as being \\"very old\\" have turned out to be no more than a couple of hundred years old.
B00005N83M|1.0|This songs on the CD [stink], and I don't know who told her she could sing, but whoever it was should be shot. She tries extremely too hard. My advice to her:  stick to acting only!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Stop what you're doing.  Don't even read anymore reviews.  Do yourself a favor and buy the record.  Listen to the whole thing.  If there is a bit of decency in you, you will feel it.  But there is more heart and melody, more melancholy and meaning in this record than in almost any major label release in five years.
