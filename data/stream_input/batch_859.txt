B000001DVD|5.0|`High `n' Dry' is where it really ended for me with Def Leppard though I did enjoy `Pyromania' and `Hysteria'.  The band's second album and their first to be produced by Mutt Lange was for all intents and purposes their goodbye to NWOBHM and hello to the pop music mega stardom of the latter part of the `80's.  `High `n' Dry' was one of the key records of my adolescence; sealing the deal for all time that I was never going to be a new wave guy but a hard rock/metal guy.  This LP is the best of Def Leppard as a true metal band, which may be hard for metal fans to digest as the band veered from that path long ago.  \\"Let It Go\\", \\"Another Hit and Run\\", the title track and \\"Bringin' on the Heartbreak\\" were just a roller coaster of sheer commercial metal glory! The second half, though not as key as the first included \\"Lady Strange\\", \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" and \\"On Through the Night\\" (curiously not from the debut, although the genesis of this song may have come during the 1st LP); all classic songs that you sure won't hear today.  Supposedly the band disowns this record too except for \\"Heartbreak\\"??? What?????!!! That's pathetic though I did see them in '87 and they did play, \\"Hit and Run\\" (obviously the highlite for me!). Pete Willis would soon be axed for his boozing and Phil Collen would help lead the band to multiplatinum paradise but at what cost?? I will never accept the fact that Lepp was a better band from `Pyromania' on and the Willis/Clark partnership was the band's best as a true AC/DC-Lizzy clone then the Collen/Clark or Collen/Campbell one. True fans of 80's rock will love `OTTN' and `High n' Dry' and will mark `Pyromania' as the beginning of the end...don' t need a reason, reason to be cool!

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|First, I must confess I'm a groupie.  If it were possible to wear out a CD, I would have had to replace In Memory of Trees a dozen times before I finally converted to my iPod.<br /><br />IMHO Enya continues her winning ways.  I wove this album into my very eclectic holiday playlist last Christmas, and every time one of her songs came on I got comments from anyone else listening.  There is such a peace and joy that lies just underneath the surface of her work, and when that blended w/ the general joy of the season, it felt like magic.<br /><br />O Come O Come Emmanuel is by far my favorite piece on this album.  Only four songs on the album are truly \\"christmas\\" songs, so I've included the rest in my year-round playlist.  I have over four hours of Enya, and when I want to feel mellow, that's the playlist I put on.<br /><br />If you love Enya, here is more of her.  And I'm grateful that this album is a more robust 44 mins, versus her last (A Day Without Rain) which came in at a meager 30-some minutes.
B0015519VS|3.0|this cd had good songs on it, but it is not like his other cd's. You can tell he change the style of the music, but there still some good songs like \\"best thing\\", Here i stand, and trading places. I say if you are a fan then get the cd. The shpping was great and the price of the cd.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I am totally fascinated by the Dexter Story. It is different from the sometimes boring every day themes you are confronted with concerning criminal series. Great Story with high suspense and unespected outgoing. I can highly recommend Dexter Season 2 as well and can hardly wait to see Season3! Outrageous.
0757307272|3.0|Such important principles deserve a clearer, friendlier format.  The information and quotes are inspiring and useful but the overall look of the book is cold and does not invite the reader.  I would love to see this kind of encouragement for teens published in an appealing look.
B00005YJMX|4.0|As a youngster, I remember seeing a clip of the original Nosferatu on television - some sort of movie monster documentary, I assume - and I still remember that image of Max Schrek, hunched over and roaming the deck of the ship that brings him to Germany, with his grasping, outstretched claws, and the unreal shade of the sky behind him.  In all the years following, I've never tracked down a copy of the whole film - I'm afraid the impression I have from that singular memory of thirty or more years ago would be dulled by the affects of age on both myself and on the film.    Instead, I have Werner Herzog's vision as a substitute, allowing me to preserve the terrible image I remember, and, I had hoped, to enhance it with a more modern experience.  Unfortunately, when competing against a memory from childhood, the present will almost always fail, and for me, Herzog's 'Nosferatu' suffered in comparison with the tiny scrap of the original I remember.     That doesn't mean that Herzog turned in a substandard effort, or that Kinski's Dracula (Count Orlock in the original) isn't amazing.  But I thought the emphasis Herzog was looking for was not so much horror, but the pathetic inhumanity of the creature, and his even more pathetic longing for love and his own destruction.    What makes both editions of 'Nosferatu' different from the raft of other vampire movies is the portrayal of the creature.  Kinski and Schrek offered us a picture of a demon, a diseased vermin feeding on humans.  Late in the movie, when Kinski bites Lucy Harker's neck, the image is grotesque and disturbing - as it should be.  In more mainstream films, the vampire's more unappealing traits are either subdued, or transformed into innocuous necessities, and the vampiric powers are portrayed in a enviable light (Torch light, I suppose).  Want to live forever?  Be young and beautiful forever?  Join an exciting group of other young and beautiful people forever?  Take this one step further and add an erotic element and you have an very iconic if false image.  No need to worry about that with Kinski.  There can only be a very small, if not nonexistant, group to fetishize his demon.    I was surprised to see how closely Herzog followed Bram Stoker's storyline, as I was under the impression that the original was a quite different story.  Regardless, once again Johnathan Harker is dispatched by his superior Renfield to Transylvania, to Castle Dracula to conclude a business arrangement with the Count.  He arrives and is offered a meal by Dracula, and Kinski is so over the top in his makeup while he looms over Harker (Bruno Ganz), staring at him with such longing that I laughed out loud.  From there, Dracula learns of Harker's wife Lucy, and his obsession begins.  He quickly leaves for Germany, leaving the hapless Harker to follow as best he can while suffering from the Vampire's bite.    In 'Nosferatu', when Dracula arrives, the townsfolk are convinced the plague has descended upon them, and Herzog uses some fantastic imagery of rats and coffins and a town gone mad.  But there also seems to be a remoteness to the film, something that at all times kept me from suspending belief and engaging with the film.  Mostly this is because there are no characters to throw your support behind.  Dracula is too repulsive and Harker is too weak (and foolish).  Lucy is the only heroic character, but her screen time is too short, and Van Helsing plays an ineffectual and disbelieving doctor.  We are left with the true hero of most of Herzog's films, which is the captured image on the screen itself.      Horror fans are likely to be disappointed with the film, but I would consider it a must see for Klaus Kinski admirers.  If you have enjoyed other Herzog movies, then I would also recommend 'Nosferatu' for its departure into genre territory.  And though I enjoyed it, it still pales in comparison to the tiny scrap of memory I have of Count Orlock, stalking toward the camera, looking for his next victim.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Wonderful story composed of and told through Beatles lyrics. If you lived through the Vietnam era you will remember everything that happens here. See how many of the cultural references you can pick out! Takes at least two viewings to catch them all.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|It's easy to get caught up in the origins of this album - Motley Crue's bass player, Rock n' Roll drug addiction, rehab, etc.  However, if you free yourself to look at this as a standalone album, it is one of the most powerful, heartfelt expressions of rock to be released in the last 10 years.      The songs are heavy, but melodic.  Stories of addiction, hopelessness, and recovery are voiced poetically by Nikki Sixx over powerful music.  Others are sung masterfully by James Michael.  The end result?  A moving, nearly flawless rock album that keeps you coming back over and over.  Each time, a new layer peels off.      Enjoy.
0743270754|4.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin  bring life to her characters.  I could visualize The men and their wives.  Their trips on the law circuit and the long conversations they had in the evenings around the fire. I got the feel of the country during this period before the Civil war.    This is a very good book and worth the time it takes to read it.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|I love this movie and I just bought the Blu-Ray version.  It is excellent!  The quality is awesome and all the colors are so bright and crisp while still maintaining the gloomy atmosphere.  I noticed lots more things that I'd never noticed before while watching the movie.  Blu-Ray really made me appreciate the film's special effects.  It has some great making of featurettes too!

B0000AUHPK|4.0|The acting and costuming are very good in this movie.<br />The moor is well done in the desolation.<br />The ghost of Cathy comes to Wuthering Heights to claim a soul after Heathcliff digs up her grave: thus, in this version it has a gothic  slant. Emily Bronte's prose  has a brooding feel that is captured well here.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|This is one of those films that stays with you even after the lights have come up.  Jolie is heartwrenching as the mother of a missing boy in Jazz Age L.A., caught up in a corruption filled old boys network, that wants this all to go away.  Eastwoods period film is beautiful to look at, the way the color seems infused with sepia as if the colors will bleed off the celluloid.  The film follows the abduction and aftermath and I must be honest, its at times a very hard film to watch, some scenes are brutal.  Jolie is perfect as the working mother, whose son is her life, she's a trusting person who wants of believe all is what it seems, but knows in her heart that something is very wrong.  Changeling is a very Eastwood film, in that it is a character study and is very indepth, he really leaves nothing on the cutting room floor so to speak.  It's hard to know what to think as the film fades to black, I was emotionally exhausted.  I do recommend this film, but be forewarned it's not for the weak at heart and frankly if your the mother of a young son you might think really hard before watching this, because you may never let him out of your site again.

B001GJ2ZCA|2.0|After getting off to a strong start with their first three albums, including the excellent 'Aha Shake Heartbreak' and the more mature 'Because of the Times', Kings of Leon have taken a step backward with this clunker.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the vinyl edition is mastered too slow, requiring a considerable adjustment to make it play at the correct speed. Total letdown.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This review is entirely from a perspective of a 26 year old that doesn't have kids but was curious because of the hype the movie created.  I am a big fan of Disney movies in general.  I think they are unique and provide some of the timeless classics that kids and adults watch and remember for years to come.    Wall-E was once again an incredible motion picture created by the people at Pixar.  I constantly wonder how much more realistic an animated picture can get.  This film down to every detail was amazing.  I wish I had watched it on a Blue-ray disc.  At first the movie feels a bit like Cast Away, the Tom Hanks movie where there is hardly any bit of communication.  It was tough keeping my attention except for the incredibly detailed animation that was accompanying the film.      As the movie went on the plot became more apparent and I started to enjoy the movie.  Don't worry there is talking eventually and you start to understand the communication as the movie roles on.  Was it the best movie Disney has created in a while?  I don't know, personally Ratatouille was more entertaining but Wall-E is really almost in a classification by itself.  I may have understood the point a little more if I had read reviews on it but overall it was another solid Disney movie.  I enjoyed it more after I watched it than while I was watching it if that makes sense.  4 & 1/2 stars would be my review but not five.  If you can watch it on the best TV you can and get it in Blu-Ray.  I think you will enjoy
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter explodes with season 3.  If you're wondering how each season can just keep getting better and better, join the crowd.  Each episode in season 3 is absolutely mesmerizing.  The razor-sharp humor is there, of course, but wait until you see Jimmy Smits play Miguel Prado.  You simply won't believe how amazing he is.  The action is gripping, explosive, etc., etc. I know I'm gushing, but it is so very deserving of the highest rating I can give it.  After watching season 3, you won't be able to deny that Dexter rocks!  The entire ensemble of actors, Michael C. Hall, especially, deserve accolade after accolade.  You guys deliver!

B000NDIAWY|5.0|Bob Dylan's story telling wrapped up in Avril Lavigne's contemporary freshness!  Yet Brandi is an original voice, all her own.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I'm a high intermediate/low advanced exerciser who picked up this DVD as I wanted a break from the usual Cathe and Firm routines that I normally workout with 5-6 days a week.  I had seen the results that Jillian obtained coaching folks on TV and was really impressed.  Unfortunately, I did each of the 3 workouts twice (in case the workout made a poor first impression) and this dvd just didn't work for me.  There were two major flaws that made me immediately sell the DVD for something else:    1.  Abs on the floor immediately after cardio segments that have your heart rate skyrocketing.  As I hit the floor, I felt my heart pounding in my head and just wanted to faint.  While some exercisers may have a body more tolerant of this sort of thing, I felt like this was unsafe.  The second time I did the workout, I \\"cooled down\\" a bit more during a pause and didn't feel the incredible discomfort quite as badly.  If you have known cardiac issues, I'd be wary of this one.    2.  High impact with what felt like inadequate stretching and warmup.  Killer on my joints.  The second time around, I had to heavily modify.  Yes, I know that Jillian said she has 400 lb people doing jumping jacks, but really, does just because we can mean that we should?  As I said in point #1, some people may have a body more tolerant of this, but my knees just said no.    Now, there were some pros:    1.  Fast paced, decent enough music, and not dull with a variety of moves.  Jillian keeps you moving constantly, so the workout breezes by quite quickly.    2.  Intense workout and instructor.  I actually got DOMS (the \\"good\\" muscle soreness) in places I hadn't had it before in a long time.  Jillian is also \\"boot camp\\" in style and her cheesy comments are oddly motivating.  :)    But overall, for me, the cons and discomfort this workout provoked outweighed the good and I sold this one.  Sorry, Jillian, I really wanted to love this one!  :(
B001LRJH0U|5.0|It's good to use 'interesting' as a title for a western review. There have been too-few westerns about which one could say 'interesting'. McCabe & Mrs. Miller, High Noon, Unforgiven and Once Upon a Time in the West are a few which come to mind just now. 'Interesting' as in many-faceted, multi-leveled, complex, conflicting and challenging.    Most westerns go for all-out action, supported with maybe some character development. Dandy; that's what most audiences want. In APPALOOSA, character is key; the people, their motivations, natures, complexities and cut-to-the-bone human nature drive all the action. The fast, realistic action makes the points in this fine motion picture so memorable, so impressive.    APPALOOSA's not a psychological thriller, nuanced and sophisticated. It's about simple people living in a time of absolutes and place without precedents. Do or die, black/white, live or die. No spin, no hype, no equivocation. No how-to manual. As such, it comes across as a pretty-sophisticated motion picture.    I collect movies. In the western genre, this fine film is a stand-out, a stand-alone. It is, thankfully, very well done. Understatement everywhere, awkwardness, figgering thangs out and doing what needs be done, direct and fast or else. I look forward to seeing it again. It sure proves Mies van der Rohe's famous line (referring to architecture) \\"Less is More.\\"    ( And if you like for-real westerns, read Annie Proulix's book of short stories, CLOSE RANGE/WYOMING STORIES. If you can get an Amazon look-inside on it, just read page 253. Can't get much plainer/real/essential as that. This movie sorta feels like that. )

159102594X|4.0|This series is a pretty fun read.  It's not the best writing but the characters are extremely enjoyable and Abercrombie's character management is excellent.  He handles a lot of characters and they all possess unique personalities.  Now despite this, the trilogy is just lacking a stronger writing style which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  In fact I almost gave it 3 stars because the writing can be very plain at times.  Thought the third book had a beutiful ending which pushed my 3 stars to 4 stars, but I guess he's come out with a fourth book so the series is not done yet.  Hopefully he doesn't ruin the story.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|I really enjoy nature but I find most documentaries about nature to be very boring because they tend to overdo the same subject to death. Planet Earth is nice because it covers many areas of interest in a compelling way that flows from one thing to another very nicely. Each \\"episode\\" has a theme but that theme is usually pretty broad and covers many interesting aspects of wildlife and the terrain.    Additionally, this movie is quite beautiful in high-def. HD-DVD and Blu-Ray owners would do well to have this in their collection if only to show off the capabilities of their sets. It is something that must be seen to believe. We borrowed the normal DVD release from a friend and it looked good, but the beauty of the places this documentary covers can really only be taken in on HD. Its absolutely amazing some of the things they managed to catch on video, and the angles are absolutely amazing.    I highly recommend this to anyone who wants the definitive nature documentary. If you own only one \\"educational\\" box set, make it this one.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is not only one of the best Sci-Fi shows, it is probably one of the top ten series ever on TV.  And the movie was even better. Hard to believe it was cancelled.

0312383320|5.0|On the whole I think this is one for Plum addicts who are familiar with the characters in the series. As always I'd recommend anyone new to Evanovich to start with One for the Money.                She anchors Stephanie Plum so firmly in the proletarian reality of downtown Trenton that we trust her and believe her when she creates characters and events beyond probability.  That's necessary in this case because the story is more fantastic than usual, with mad scientists plotting to alter the world's weather and hints of the supernatural.  She moves out from Trenton as far as Bordentown and the Pine Barrens.  Morelli, Ranger, Lula, Connie and Grandma are all here. Diesel is back, I think he first appeared in Plum Lucky.               Evanovich is such a great master of the art of writing that she ought to be studied by academics instead of sitting at the top of best-seller lists.  She is supreme at scene-setting in the active voice. When she wants to explain that two rows of houses stand back to back separated by a narrow lane she says \\"the alley cut the block.\\"  Sometimes she breaks the rules by using verbless sentences to put us in the picture \\"Maybe 1500 square feet. The size of my apartment. It looked like new construction. Nothing facy. Utilitarian windows and doors. Tin roof. Single metal pipe chimney sticking up out of the roof.\\"  (My grammar checker went crazy over that passage).
0743270754|5.0|Ms. Goodwin makes incredibly dense historical material immensely readable in this definitive study of the genius and humanity of our greatest president. It's easy to see why our new president remarked that if he could take one book into the white house it would be this. One should prepare to read this slowly, savoring every nuance and absorbing the lucid descriptions of the human characteristics that , along with the historic circumstances, defined the time and the people who shaped it. The quotes from the correspondence and speeches given during Lincoln's period provide a glimpse into a time when the english language was used with much greater richness and meaning that it is today.

B001N44BVQ|4.0|A lot of movies make espionage out to be a glamorous, tuxedoed affair.  BODY OF LIES tells the tale as it is: A world of mistrust and violence, where one minute you're negotiating, and the next you're picking your friend's bone fragments out of your arm.  Roger Ferris finds out the hard way, as he worms his way into a terrorist conspiracy and risks his life--and more--for a cause that he is beginning to question.  His boss back home, Ed Hoffman, offers Ferris advice while eating cereal and taking his kids to school.  Ferris is on his own; his friends are his enemies, and his enemies are everywhere.<br /><br />DiCaprio is perfect for the role; a true chameleon, he can slip into any character and bring them to life.  Russell Crowe is also well-suited for his role; he gained a bunch of weight, and is in fact almost unrecognizable.  He brings out the irony of his character, while also waxing poetic that makes something resembling sense.  But as good as DiCaprio and Crowe are (and they are very good, near the top of their game), the true scene stealer here is Mark Strong, who plays the Jordanian head of intelligence.  He is charming and sinister, who makes the word \\"dear\\" sound like a prophecy of doom.  He is technically a good guy, but we have to suspend our typical definitions of the word \\"good.\\"<br /><br />And that is the main strength of this film: It seems very, very real.  Nobody is a saint, and nobody is a sinner; they are all human, all with motivations and causes, just like in the real world the movie accurately reflects.  The violence is never gratuitous, and often almost too realistic; the torture scene near the end is cringe-inducing, and the explosions--there are several--are all believable, none of that typical Hollywood lights-and-sound show.  BODY OF LIES may not be perfect--there is an unnecessary romantic subplot, and viewers must always question certain facts that are presented to them on the silver screen--but it is a realistic, engaging spy thriller that poses quite a few questions, and lets the viewer judge for himself.  It is an action movie with brains; how rare and precious is that?a few questions, and lets the viewer judge for himself.  It is an action movie with brains; how rare and precious is that?
B000HIVOI2|5.0|I watched this on a 90\\" front projection screen with a full 7.1 HD setup and must say I was impressed with the transfer. The movie was nearly flawless and considering the age of the film that says a lot for the job done. The audio is what one would expect from an early 90s movie and the subtitles are all 100 percent correct. The scenes without subtitles are intentional to immerse you in the movie experience. And they add to the realism of the film. I don't honestly know what was cut from the extended version. It seemed to be very close to the original. Overall a great film that started my favorite TV series. Nicely done. If you like Stargate SG1 then you will like this movie.
B0018PH3L0|1.0|This movie is a compilation of just about every western cliche ever conceived.    Hollywood is in the business of packaging excrement and selling it as entertainment.  This is a good example.  One star only because zero isn't an option.    I watched less than an hour of it before giving up in disgust.
B0018RWD6I|3.0|After reading about this in the context of Coltrane's autobiography, I thought I would either hate or love this.  When I listened I was surprised to find that I just liked it.  It's a good example of avant-garde jazz that sounds good, that's not so far out that it's hard to listen to.  Influences from earlier types of jazz are combined with a classical sensibility.  A spiritual feeling is there for those who can sense it.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|In Clint Eastwood's career timeline, 2008 will be known as the year of GRAN TORINO (the year the film was first released; it was a mere twist of fate it started becoming so popular after the turn of the year).  TORINO is indeed a great film, perhaps one of Eastwood's career highs; however, THE CHANGELING is also a fine film, deserving of all the accolades it has and should have acquired.<br /><br />The film tells the true tale of a mother's search for her missing son, and the police corruption that prevents her from seeking justice.  Months after her son's disappearance, Christine Collins is notified by the police that they have found him.  The only problem: He's not her son.  However, she is the only one who believes that; or, rather, the police refuse to admit they made a mistake.<br /><br />The corruption of the LAPD in the 1930s has been fodder for a lot of films; it's interesting to see Eastwood's take on it.  The shooting and score are glorious; the direction is well-handled, masterful.  No one doubts Eastwood knows exactly what he is doing.  The supporting actors are all well cast: John Malkovich as a radio preacher who has taken it upon himself to battle police corruption; Jason Butler Harner as an insane murderer; Amy Ryan as a sympathetic patient in a mental institution; Michael Kelly as perhaps one of the few honest cops on the LAPD's roster; Jeffrey Donovan as a menacing detective; and pretty much everybody else.  There are a lot of small roles scattered throughout the film; the focus is, of course, upon Angelina Jolie, who well deserves her Best Actress nomination (and if it weren't for Meryl Streep, she'd be a shoe-in for a win).  Jolie manages to hold the film together, as it meanders here and there (I'm willing to argue that the last forty-five minutes aren't necessary; they provide for some compelling scenes, but wouldn't be missed from the overall structure or story).  Jolie is the anchor here, along with Eastwood's steady direction, and together they have crafted a fine film about honesty, integrity, and a mother's devotion.ed a fine film about honesty, integrity, and a mother's devotion.

I loved all the bits of wisdom, almost Zen-like, that were sprinkled throughout the book. Stein had me laughing and crying, and the ending was a nice surprise. Highly recommended, even if you're not a dog lover, or into car racing. It's simply a well-written and entertaining book.
B001EVPBY4|5.0|I can only add to the the chorus of praise for this outstanding production. It unbelievably good. I am a great fan of Baroque Opera and this presentation is a dream come true. The music of Lully is done on period instruments, the sets, costumes, stage machinery, dances and dance steps true to the era, singers who can sing such music naturally, even the lighting by candles and all this conducted by someone who is akin to the spirit of the composer. This is truly heaven-sent. I always approach productions of Baroque and Bel Canto opera DVDs with great trepidation as so often the directors, curse them, will present Romeo and Juliet in a Brooklyn brothel or worse, or some other Eurotrash clap-trap e.g just look over what's been done to Handel's masterpieces. Here at last is what can be done by dilligent and respectful production personel and musicians. I am simply awe struck by the masterful presentation

0375842209|5.0|I don't recall a book moving me so much since [[ASIN:1555838537 Stone Butch Blues: A Novel]].  This novel makes a fine trilogy with [[ASIN:0553577123 The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition]] and [[ASIN:0385333846 Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novel]].  Anne Frank tells the story of the brilliant Jew in hiding, Vonnegut gives a surreal time-traveling spin to an American survivor of the Dresden bombings, and [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]] is the story of the Germans who suffered and knew what they were seeing as it happened.<br /><br />I wasn't crazy about narrator Death's choppy style in this book, but even that reminded me of Vonnegut (e.g., [[ASIN:0385334206 Breakfast of Champions]]).<br /><br />Perhaps it's easier for teenagers to read about suffering children such as Liesel and Anne.  As much as I admired Anne Frank during the many times I read her diary as a teenager, it never affected me like it did years later, rereading it at 35, when Anne had metamorphed from an admired peer to a brilliant, doomed child.<br /><br />And yet, this story must never be forgotten, no matter how much it makes us cry, no matter how much we like to think it could never happen here, wherever our current \\"here\\" happens to be.  I found myself reading it slower and slower, dreading to pick it up again, because we all know what really happens, and that fiction can be truth.
B001N44BVQ|2.0|I was hoping for something interesting from Scott but what I got was a production by an assorted lot of actors, writers, producers and so forth that have probably spent their lives doing nothing more eventful than shopping the boutiques of Hollywood. And, enhanced by their other primary source for knowledge of the affairs of the world - newspapers, they have created another CIA/Middle East fantasy full of stereotypes.  Specifically:   (1.) A couple of cheaply done market street explosions; a couple of cheaply & boring car and foot chases with a few wild gun shots for effect; a couple of tortures or mock (pun?) tortures; desert scene and spy satellite images. That's the backdrop.    (2.) CIA is typically ideological and dumb; terrorists are stereotypically ideological and slightly less dumb. However, CIA always wins in the end because they have one person who is smarter/tougher. Oh, and have better technology/weapons - simplistic.  Dialogue - made up by writers who have no clue as to how conversations actually take place at that level. One smart CIA operative is always smarter than everyone above him and always at odds.   (3.) Another rerun of every spy movie ever made.
0743277708|4.0|I'd always heard that this was one of those must read books.  A classic of English literature.  Yet, despite being repeatedly told to read it no one could ever explain to me what the book was about.  I'd get some vague synopsis of rabbits, coming of age, environmentalism, tyranny, etc.  I could never fit together just how all of that was suppose to come together in a book with rabbits as the central characters.  I got my hands on a cheap copy of the book, still not sure if I wanted to read it, and dove in.  It turns out that Watership Down is a good book.  I think though that other books do what Adams was attempting better.  The story in Watership Down reminded most of the Lord of the Rings, just with rabbits and more expository lore.  I think Tolkien did it better too.  Think high fantasy with rabbits.  I came away slightly disappointed.  Not because Adams failed to engage me, rather my friends and acquaintances had failed to accurately portray the book to me and in so doing inflated my own expectations.

B001EAWMFQ|5.0|All five movies are a hoot. It's not just the sword play and the many liters of blood let in each duel. It's the whole idea. The Lone Wolf and Cub series is about a man trying not only right a wrong, but to defend a way of life that he truly believes in, loves, and is being swept away eroding virtues and encroaching vices. The various situations that he encounters gives us brief glimpses into the mind of an idealist who took a different stance than the legendary 47 ronin. If you like Japanese feudal drama, sword play, and theatrical blood baths, you'll love these flicks.  Peace!

Then eventually describes some useful java features that people are/aren't using explains their logic well enough that you can figure out yourself when to/not use them.  Also gives reasonable tips on when/how to use exception handling and in class design.<br /><br />I would consider some of the tips suicidal in some situations though but still useful.

B000Q9IZ5C|3.0|It seems that while Joss Whedon is a genius where it comes to writing TV series, it seems that his movies aren't always up to par. While it can be assumed that 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer - the move' was a flop since Joss didn't have much control of what was done to it, Serenity had no such excuse. Perhaps writing a plot which will fit a 90 to 120 minute feature film is much harder than writing one that will fit the 40 minutes or so of a weekly episode that can be extended throughout an entire season...<br /><br />Written to tie up the many loose ends of 'Firefly', my main disappointment with 'Serenity' was that it seemed too much like many other sci - fi X File style features. The plot itself was pretty perdictable (including the 'plot twist' at the end), and after a while I stopped wishing for something original to happen and just wanted the movie to end...
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I bought Voyageur in '04, and must admit that I was cool to it after the first couple of listenings. In early '05 I went to Iraq to train Iraqi police, and later asked my brother to send me the 'copies' I had made of roughly 12 CD's, including this one. Listening with headphones while writing home on my laptop, Voyageur quickly became a favorite. Right from the start with \\"From East to West\\" it was easy to forget my environment and become immersed in the unique beats and orchestrations that make Enigma a favorite. While 'Roi' is still the best and most cherished of my Enigma collection, Voyageur will forever hold a place of prestige in my heart. Friends downloaded my CD onto their iPods, some hearing Enigma for the first time, and were blown away by the artistry.  We're talking police trainers in their 50's who were suddenly introduced to a new genre that impressed. -- TM
B00004C8TC|5.0|There are, of course, a huge number of discs with this coupling, but whichever ones you've got, I urge you to add this one (unless you already have it). Lupu's and Previn's approaches are classically oriented, playing the works without fuss or idiosyncrasies. But there are so much to savor here; the loving care Lupu gives to the solo part is truly impressive - every detail seems to shine and stand out as a highlight, yet he doesn't for a moment lose track of the long lines. And the collaboration from the orchestra is no less impressive; soloist and orchestra complement each other with a grace and fluency that is hardly rivaled anywhere else. True, these are not the most dramatically fierce accounts out there, but this is still essential listening. Add a warm and detailed recorded sound and you have a recording to treasure. Strongly recommended.
B001AQWC2C|2.0|2 stars, and I am being very generous.<br /><br />First off I am not a HUGE fan of Priest. I do not own any of their T shirts, I have not seen them live, and no I most certainly do NOT have \\"Judas Priest\\" tattooed across my back. Yet when I first heard the \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" album, I thought it was excellent. I do think Halford is a good, if overrated singer (Dickinson owns him by miles). However, Point of Entry and Screaming for Vengeance are the two only albums that don't suffer from Judas Priest syndrome (the ones that preceded it are still good though)- that meaning \\"songs I can't listen to the album past\\". Then I got Turbo, and once that godawful synth started as well as the stupid Billy Idol sound, I knew I was in for a trainwreck. And RID was worse. Painkiller was only slightly better- it had great music but horrible lyrics. And don't get me started on the Ripper albums.<br /><br />Priest made a comeback with the good-if-slightly-disappointing \\"Angel of Retribution. It was good, but not as good as it could have been. Really the only song that stood out was the opening track, Judas Rising.<br /><br />And now we're at Nostradamus, and I just gotta say- it's time for these guys to hang it up and call it a day. I went into Nostradamus really wanting to like the album, and I'll admit in some bits I did. But for the most part, this album bit the big one. After the first track, the very first thing that entered my mind was \\"What were they thinking?\\"<br /><br />And then it went on and just got worse. All the songs sounded the same. There was little to no vareity. The slow intro approach worked for Iron Maiden's [[ASIN:B000H7JD4A A Matter of Life and Death]], but not here. In fact the slow intros to the songs on this album made the songs feel longer than they really did. And the lyrics are awful! In fact at times they're very unintentionally hilarious.<br /><br />The reason I give this 2 stars and not 1 is because of the fact that this has SOME good tracks- the title track is reminiscent of a bit of their classic stuff, Lost Love is a pretty cool song and Revelations is catchy. But everything else on here is just bad. The tacky and overblown orchestrations ruin everything, the concept is cool but not used to its full potential. Halford sounds tired here, Downing and Tipton repeat the same riffs over and over here, the drumming is boring and simple, and yet the whole album just feels like one big long song, even for a double disc album.<br /><br />In short, it's time for Priest to hang the gloves up. Their career has been long over, and they've just become more and more boring over the years. Hopefully they now when to call it quits.heir classic stuff, Lost Love is a pretty cool song and Revelations is catchy. But everything else on here is just bad.

044024238X|4.0|29 years old Samantha Sweeting is about to become the youngest lawyer ever in the prestigious firm of Carter & Spink. While she paid a high price to get there (especially where her personal life is concerned) - she believes it's all worth it. After all, a modern women doesn't need to learn how to cook if she can just call the closest take out joint (aren't Italian & Chinese cuisines really healthy?) and since the dry cleaners will sew on buttons for free, she doesn't eed to learn how to do so herself, right?<br /><br />But on the day her partnership is about to be announced, Samantha discovers an implicating document on her messy desk that will cost her company 5 million pounds. Instead of facing her colleagues, Samantha just leaves the office, wanders to the closest train station, and boards a random train which drops her somewhere in the country. Insulted into accepting a job as a housekeeper, she now must learn how to cook, clean, iron, and even how to operate a washing machine...<br /><br />When suddenly she discovers that she actually hadn't made a mistake & reveals a secret within her old law firm that would certainly win her the partnership she longed for, Samantha needs to decide whether she even wants her old life back...<br /><br />While raising the question of the price we all pay if we choose a \\"City Career\\", it seems that Kinsella has taken her character to the extreme - either have the\\"perfect\\" career, or be a housekeeper - there's no middle ground of working as a lawyer in a smaller office or a less demanding position that will allow her to enjoy her personal life too, since she obviously connects to both lifestyles on different levels.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|Loved this movie still crack up thinking about it. Though I would have to agree with another reviewer about the 2 disk rental/purchase. You have the optional one with the director's commentary which is beyond hysterical & was quite a pleasant surprise. I loved this movie I would have to say it was probably my favorite movie of the year. Because when I rented it I thought oh gee here we go another one of those movies. It actually turned out to be pretty damn funny!
B00127RAJY|5.0|So...a month ago I realized I'm turning 30 in 6 months. I REALLY need to lose 30lbs. I started a workout campaign called \\"30 by 30\\" (30lbs by age 30). I pulled out the treadmill, I setup my mp3 player with a great playlist and found every excuse NOT to exercise. I rented a different JM workout video and really liked her style but not that particular video...I read all of the reviews about this video and decided to give it a shot. I stared at it for 3 days after it arrived.     Today I attempted my first work out. I took Jillian's advice in the intro and started with Level 1. About 16 minutes in (I pressed info on my remote to see how much longer because I didn't think I was going to make it!!) I was out of breathe, my legs were shaking, my shoulders were sore, I was panting, sweating and about to give up...somewhere around the time when I started moving toward the couch to rest, Jillian started commenting about the fact that we're probably sweating and grunting and feeling like we're going to die but to keep going...because if we want it, we have to earn it...and that if we keep going when it feels like we can't anymore, that was when change would happen...something about that modivated me to finish the video.     It was a great work out--probably one of the best I've ever had from a work out video--and I'm really looking forward to working out with Jillian for the next 30 days. I will post an update in 1 month.

B001IF9WK0|5.0|First of all, there is no official release of this album here in USA, at least at this moment, and the DVD is not in region 1, unless you have a multiple region DVD player so check carefully before you make any purchase. Most of the CD sold by ebay is either from Argentina, Europe, Asia or Australia.     Secondly, this is great album, the additional songs and videos added to the standard edition is awesome. That's all i can say.    Check out the radio edit of track 7 and also the video of Blunt singing live. He is absolutely fantastic.
B001PILRGC|5.0|Purchased this on demand content, but kind of ticked I can't get it onto my TiVo. This was an excellent series, that I am ashamed it came to an end. A crappy end, but an end none the less. I purchased this video and watched it on my computer, and it plays with absolutely no problems. Love the fact, that their is no commercials involved.

1844003213|4.0|Peggy Porschen has many beautiful and creative decorating ideas, and it's easy to want all of them!  However, be aware that this book is IDENTICAL to her \\"Beautiful Cakes\\" book.  I think the \\"romantic\\" version was published for the UK, and the \\"beautiful\\" version was published for the US.  The only differences I saw were in measurements (centimeter vs inch) and the names of some items (rolled fondant instead of sugar paste; decorating bag instead of piping bag).  Beautiful ideas all around!

B00005QW5X|5.0|I've read some reviews where people just didn't understand, and I can understand some of that. It's a story about a world far from our own, and that's why i think it's so amazing. Hedwig is an amazing person, and I found this movie hysterical and touching.    If you are one for indie, documentary-like films then you should see this! The music is amazing, and 'midnight radio' is now a top fav of mine. I think this movie is loved by a select crowd, but still should been seen by everyone.   However I don't think I'd watch this with my parents, lol. Some parts of the movie are odd, nothing wrong with the scenes...just culturally odd. :/  for example, the gummy bear scene. Yet I still loved every minute of it.     Hope all of you will enjoy the movie :)
075640407X|5.0|The story of Kvothe -- the hero, the villain, the street urchin, the master musician and frighteningly talented mage. He is all of these things and so much more. But don't take my word for it, he will tell you himself in this 700+ page story that captures the heart of growing up in a world just as harsh as our own and shows us that we can become whatever it is we set out to become -- through hard work, curiousity, determination and a lust for life.<br /><br />This book is compared to the Harry Potter series. And while that series is great in its own right, the comparison here is completely unfair. This is much darker, sadder and more laden with adult themes. The magic isn't simply a wand, a flying broom and a silly name uttered by lips. You'll have to see for yourself.<br /><br />The writing is tight and flows extremely well -- not too flashy but definitely has finesse infused in the prose. The characters are fleshed out mightily and the protagonist is honestly one of the most memorable I've read since Ender's Game.<br /><br />The best way I can put it is this: The Name of the Wind is like one a sweet song spun on a lute's strings. Touching on the full range of emotions at one time or another during its course, always beautiful, always captivating and never lasting quite as long as you'd like. This book flies by -- much like the wind. I absolutely can't wait for the second book of the trilogy.
B0008JIJ2E|4.0|This is a good movie you can watch with the whole family.  It's one of those feel-good movies.
B000M4RG42|4.0|I agree with some of the previous reviewers comments - particularly in relation to confusion over the main characters. However as with most of Clint Eastwoods films this has a depth to it that is missing from the majority of films. It is beautifully shot. Clint Eastwood has defintely watched John Ford films. There was one shot with a character framed in a doorway, which could have been straight out of the Searchers.<br /><br />The battle scenes which are spread throughout the film are well done and the effect they have on the main characters is profound. I don't want to see 2 hours of continuous carnage, so the jump cuts to different times were a welcome relief from the horrors of war. The sequences where the 'heroes' are dragged round to raise money for the war effort seemed very authentic, and I could feel myself getting angrier as it went along. Having been traumatised by the war, when you return to the US you don't get to be with your family, you are treated like a commodity to raise money.<br /><br />Ultimately it is a rather depressing film, but sometimes I need to watch an honest movie about the awful effects of war rather than a purely gung-ho film (which have their place). See this and then watch Clint Eastwoods companian film 'Letters from Iwo Jima' which looks at the same battle from the Japanese point of view and is probably the better of the two films.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a really enjoyable movie to watch on many levels.  One can not help but be inspired to get fit.  Schwarzenegger is the central figure and he is fascinating to watch.  Not only is his body incredible, he combines that with a terrific sense of humor and a ruthless desire to win.  We see the mind games that the body builders play w/ each other to try and get an advantage.  The pose-off w/ Arnold going against Franco Columbo is anti-climactic, as Franco looks like his son when standing next to him...
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Can't do justice to the reviewing the movie.  Its a graphic sexual violent thing.  It has echos of Sweet Movie or vice versa,  but its not funny in the same way. Its absurd except that its not at all,  its completely decadent, and in the most horrible way, believable.  The edition is very good, additional commentary and essays remarkable... I have never seen a movie that actually listed its own bibliography in the opening titles.   Salo, and this seems forgotten is both a reference to a town in Italy where fascists committed atrocities during their final days under Mussolini. Also,  the movie does what it can to call out Italy's fascist history,  role in WW2,  etc.  Having known Italians and Germans, and visited both countries,  it seems that the Germans have the harder time with their past.  But this movie suggests that its much more complicated in Italy than is commonly understood.  To Italian credit,  there is no such equivalent German or Austrian film,  instead we are given crap like The Reader, which is all but useless.  Interestingly there is a startlingly coherent and not bizarrely crazy fascist party in Northern Italy now,  some version of neo-con's but with a European fascist flare.  So Salo, complicated as it is,  remains an important movie if only to help or to remind  us to keep our eye on where things, like fascism might go,  they don't just go away...  Its not an easy movie, but its an important one, and grotesque enough to compete with a history of political satire from Goya to Daumier.  Good luck.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|This greatest hits serves as a decent introduction to the band,but hardly captures the band's essence properly.  If one really wants to hear this band,than the legendary debut is the way to go.  A greatest hits like this works best for kids and/or Radio listeners who are not very heavy minded.  The tracks included are decent enough,but the deep album cuts and fan favorites are entirely absent including \\"Rocket Queen\\",\\"Mr.Brownstone\\",\\"Night train\\",\\"I Used to Love Her\\" and most of the Use Your Illusion albums are not very well represented.  There's probally too many covers,excepting the well done cover of \\"Knockin on Heaven's Door\\",there is also the pointless \\"Live and Let Die\\" and the boring cover of \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\",both of which serve no purpose on this compilation.  Still,at the price it's not the worst one disc compilation you'll find,and if it's the radio hits you dig,than you could do worse.    Note:The CD's design is a bit funny,all scratched up and beaten.Certainly to raise a few eyebrows to any that gaze over your music collection.

Otherwise, it would not be found in the public schools!<br /><br />So, I read it, enjoyed it, and came away glad that there are still some edgy books like this still in the public schools. Fairy tales like \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" and \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" may be revised to remove the violence and unfavorable portrayals of wolves as \\"big\\" and \\"bad.\\" But what's this?

There is still a book in which one of the heroes (the grandmother), smokes. And right out there on the sleeve, is the concept of mortality and that things do not always turn out right.

B00004YX39|5.0|During the 70s & 80s, friends who were as crazy about music as I was kept me abreast of the Steely Dan albums. Strangely, I never felt compelled to buy any. Twenty-five years later I decided to change that, and purchased the one that surfaced in my consciousness - Gaucho. I could not believe what I heard: music and lyrics so devastatingly sophisticated, complex, disturbing, uplifting, soothing, rewarding... When the album ends, I keep re-playing it and eventually pack it away only to prevent myself from ever running the risk of tiring of it! I could not believe that I had done without it for so long, but then realised that the intervening c25 years of avid music listening would surely have refined my palate too - so the wait was truly worth the while. Viva Gaucho! Every track rates 5 stars in my estimation, and the sum is greater than the total of the parts. The re-mastering has rendered the good music perfect. Get this album now.

B00000IL26|5.0|The Sidewinder is certainly Lee Morgan's most famous album.  The title track was a smash hit at the time and was even featured in a Chrysler TV commercial during the 1965 World Series.  And it has sold well ever since.<br /><br />While the funky title track is highly enjoyable, the other 4 tunes and alternate take of \\"Totem Pole\\" are equally outstanding and full of the blues.  In fact, \\"Totem Pole\\" is probably the most sophisticated and interesting tune and \\"Gary's Notebook\\" is also quite inventive.  \\"Boy, What a Night\\" cranks up the heat for a waltz and \\"Hocus-Pocus\\" closes the album in a relaxed mood.<br /><br />Morgan is outstanding on trumpet throughout and Joe Henderson is just as good on tenor sax.  The sound of the RVG remastering is very clear with plenty of bass and cymbals so that you can hear all the music behind the soloists.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|It seems in the state of California [and perhaps nationwide] you can not return a CD, due to copyright laws, even when it's deceptively packaged.  In the retail store [I knew I should have previewed it on Amazon] you have absolutely no indication that this is not really a Beatle's recording. It was not until I opened it and listened to it and had access to the INSIDE of the jewel case, and voila, the true nature of this CD's origins are made clear - it is a horrible mishmash of sounds and lyrics and junk.  I explained my dilemma to the Target customer service rep, but I had no recourse.  I hate this CD and no one should waste this kind of $ to purchase it - I could have spent my $15 on Magical Mystery Tour.  Lesson learned: Always check with Amazon before buying a product you're unfamiliar with.

B000ION79Y|3.0|The story line of the movie is pretty good.  The problem with the movie, being a staunch Steven Seagal fan, is that his voice was accidentally dubbed over.<br />I see by the DVD case this is a United Kingdom-Romania production.  Some of the actors are not speaking English and are dubbed over in English.  That, of course, is fine and well done.<br />Apparently the voice of Steven Seagal was accidentally erased during this process in some places and dubbed over with a voice that does not even attempt to mimic Mr. Seagal.<br />This was unacceptable, should have been corrected in some way and totally detracted from the enjoyment of the movie.
B00005JL96|4.0|Lilo & Stitch is one hour and fifteen minutes long and was released on June 21, 2002. Lilo & Stitch won the 2002 Artios Award for Animated Voice Over Feature and 2002 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing for Music in an Animated Feature Film. This was first for Disney in a couple ways. First this was Disney first science fiction animation cartoon and second, it was the first movie to be original and not set on a story. The DVD includes: Build An Alien Experiment Game, DisneyPedia: Hawaii, A Stitch in Time, The Young Voices of Hawaii, \\"Burning Love\\": Behind the Scenes with Wynonna, and How-To-Hula Lesson. The movie is about an alien named Stitch who escaped from the Galactic Federation and crashed lands on Earth. Stitch wakes up in dog shelter and is adopted by Lilo. Stitch goes to live with Nani and Lilo. Nani looks to be about eighteen years old and Lilo looks to be about six or eight. Nani is the caretaker of Lilo because we found out the movie that their parents died in a car crash. Along the way Stitch seems to be adjusting to family life. The movie does a great job of combining animation and computer technology. This is a great family movie. I am giving it an AA++.
B001E75QH0|4.0|Owning the entire Indiana Jones series, digitally remastered, is great fun for the family.  The picture and audio are very good.  I have trouble understanding the cost, though.  Would think Amazon could offer this set at a slightly discounted price over many stores like Walmart.  Still, this is a great choice for family entertainment.  Use a DVD Upconvert player like the Toshiba E500 to enjoy a cleaner, clearer picture with these movies since this movie set isn't Blu-Ray.
0618001905|5.0|The purpose of King Leopold's Ghost: to bring to light the events of the past concerning the colonization of the Congo and the horrifying foreign regime of King Leopold II of Belgium, to remember the efforts of E.D. Morel, William Sheppard, George Washington Williams, Roger Casement, and other reformers who brought to light the atrocities being committed in the Congo and organized pressure for eventual reforms, and then to make readers aware of how quickly and ready the world was to forget most of the evil in colonial Africa. It succeeds at least in one important respect, though this and the Heart of Darkness are my only perspectives into this period of African Colonization so I cannot speak authoritatively on all of its veracity, I praise the book for succeeding in the same way the book says the reform movement succeeded, it ennobles and continues the tradition of the human spirit against evil. I praise the book for lighting a fire in my stomach, not to hate anyone, but only to fight to love and protect people. Not only stirring my heart and conscience against thoughtless evil and regret that the human race I belong to is capable of committing evils of such magnitude, but stirring my passions to fight intensely for change in the world, and planting ideas as to how best bring that change about and to banish the ever present apathy in the world.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|Great movie. If you like this kind of action movie, I would highly recommend it.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|While this year's Oscar batch may disappoint the box office, I find the level of the nominated movies quite outstanding. 'Doubt' is one of the excellent movies in the competition; it is a theater play put on the screen with the best cast that you could find for it. Streep and P.S.Hoffman and two more actresses are in the race for acting awards, and that is well deserved.<br /><br />Streep is a self-righteous Catholic school principal in New York, a nun; she runs her shop by fear and mistrust. It is 1964. Hoffman is the parish priest, and he lives by different rules. She dislikes him for his kindness and for his popularity. He takes sugar with his tea! He writes with a ball-point pen! He is nice to people! He smokes!<br /><br />She is out to catch him with something, anything, and instructs one of her underlings to watch specifically for odd behaviour. The young nun reports that she found one of her 12 y old students, the only black boy, an altar boy, visibly disturbed and smelling of alcohol, after a meeting with the priest.<br /><br />Streep's character picks on this piece of incomplete information and blows it out of proportion. She goes head on for the confrontation, and of course nobody can win against the kind of allegations and suspicions that can grow out of it. The two lead actors carry the confrontation. A mediocre cast would have run the movie aground.
B001EO2UKO|3.0|I might be unfair of me to write this, because I haven't been around to really listen to the cd, but every ti me I try, it just doesn't appeal to me like the two first ones. Still, it's very Dido. I'll give it some othe tries!
B001IMFHVG|4.0|Caveat: I grew up a complete fan of Rubinstein. In my day you were either for Horowitz or for Rubinstein. I never had any doubts. And when I heard him the first time at age ten I was so overwhelmed I went home and told my teacher I wanted to learn the whole program he'd played. She relented enough to allow me to learn Villa Lobos's O Polichinello (Polichinelle, or Harlequin) and it became one of my party pieces until well into my adulthood. So, of course, I have collected a great deal of Rubinstein on record. And on DVD, too. The sparse notes for this issue -- a filmed record of a recital Rubinstein performed in 1964 in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory -- make it sound like its value is in the fact that live recordings of Rubinstein are rare, but that's just not true. Just look at what's on offer here at Amazon, e.g. [[ASIN:B0012L0TCA Artur Rubinstein in Concert]], and you'll realize that their statement is puffery. Still, this is a valuable record of Rubinstein's playing in his late 70s; he clearly still had chops and although there are occasional dropped or smudged notes, the Rubinstein magic is all there.<br /><br />The recital proper is entirely music by Chopin, and of course it for Chopin that Rubinstein was best known. I still think he's one of the absolute masters of that Polish master. The recital opens with a magisterial Polonaise in F sharp minor, Op. 44, and the recital proper closes with the 'Heroic' Polonaise in A flat major, Op. 53 in a barnburner of a performance. Rubinstein's dizzying left-hand octaves are still there! Mood-painting is not neglected, either. The D flat major Nocturne, op. 27, No. 2 is like moonlight. The Barcarolle in F sharp minor, Op. 60, is sheer poetry. The highlight of the four included &eacute;tudes is the A flat major, Op. 25, No. 1, which whirls by in a flash. (Interesting fact: Rubinstein never played all of the &eacute;tudes, possibly for reasons of technique.) But the real highlight of the Chopin group is the Second Piano Sonata in B flat minor, Op. 25, the so-called 'Funeral March' sonata. He does not dawdle over the funeral march movement, unlike some, but still conveys its grave mood. The whirlwind final movement may be slightly over-pedaled but its eeriness still raises goosebumps.<br /><br />Four encores follow: Des Abends (Evening) from Schumann's Fantasiest&uuml;cke, Op. 12, is in slightly less clear sound but its poetry comes through nonetheless. Chopin's Waltz in A major, Op. 34, No. 1, Debussy's diaphanous Ondine, and Villa Lobos's O Polichinello conclude the program to thunderous applause.<br /><br />The DVD tacks on a couple of bizarre bonuses, silent film excerpts from a 1928 film made in Canada; the cuts are excerpts from two Chopin &eacute;tudes -- E minor, Op. 25, No. 5 and C minor, Op. 25, No. 12. I'm not clear what watching a silent film of Rubinstein playing is supposed to accomplish, but there you are.<br /><br />The film of the Moscow recital is in grainy black-and-white and fairly acceptable mono sound. Total time: 97mins. Format: NTSC 4:3. Region code: 0 (worldwide).<br /><br />I can't really recommend this as an only DVD of Rubinstein's playing, but it is certainly recommended for those who are Chopin lovers, pianophiles and/or Rubinstein fans.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonnd Piano Sonata in B flat minor, Op. 25, the so-called 'Funeral March' sonata.

B00122KUEG|4.0|When first hearing this album, I was very overwhelmed, with all the power Madonna put in her songs this time---- some songs are very strong, while others are very soft. I'm going to breakdown my review!<br /><br />1.) American Life- 8.5/10<br />Madonna gives a really interesting message in this song, with her whole new attitude. It's interesting to see her critique the \\"American Life\\" without really saying anything offensive directly. I think the song is good but not my favorite from the rest of her songs.<br /><br />2.) Hollywood- 9.5/10<br />This song is so crazy- I love it! She does the whole indirect message thing again (without saying negative things about Hollywood) and it's a fun song to listen to!<br /><br />3.) I'm so Stupid- 9/10<br />I love how Madonna doesn't hold back in this song! This track is so funky fresh! I love the \\"stupider than stupid\\" part.<br /><br />4.) Love Profusion- 9.5/10<br />Another favorite from her album! It's like the happy track of the album! I love the message, along with her breezy/vibrant music video!<br /><br />5.) Nobody Knows Me- 9.5/10<br />Out of all her songs from this album, I LOVE THIS MESSAGE of the song the most. It's totally true, and she does an awesome job mixing techno into her singing! I love it when she says \\"don't want your social disease.\\" It's simply an interesting track.<br /><br />6.) Nothing Fails- 8.5/10<br />This is a soft and rejuvenating song. I like how she's speaking what's on her mind!<br /><br />7.) Intervention- 7.5/10<br />I really don't listen to this song, but it's not a bad song! It's like the softer and more gentle side of Madonna's singing!<br /><br />8.) X-static Process- 8/10<br />This song is very serious, with her even mentioning Jesus in her song, and saying \\"if I should give a damn.\\" It's kind of a good song, but I think the song is too serious for my taste.<br /><br />9.) Mother and Father- 7.5/10<br />Woah! this song doesn't even sound like Madonna! It's kind of impressive, but again not type of song.<br /><br />10.) Die Another Day- 9.5/10<br />This song is so powerful! like \\"destroy my ego\\" and \\"suspend my pleasures.\\" It's a song I think this song is like the most \\"universal\\" song meaning it can appeal to A LOT of people vs. her other songs on the album. I personally enjoy this song, it's just simply amazing!<br /><br />11.) Easy Ride- 6.5/10<br />This song is like too descriptive (\\"blood and sweat on my fingers\\"?) I think this is the only song from the album where I can say she could have done a lot better with this song!<br /><br />-----Overall I love how she stepped out of the box, not only from her typical music, but from the rest of the today's typical music. was it successful? To me yes, but many for some reason don't like it! It all depends on your taste of music!----------pend my pleasures.\\" It's a song I think this song is like the most \\"universal\\" song meaning it can appeal to A LOT of people vs. her other songs on the album.

0345495004|4.0|Usually when I buy a book I know the general storyline and plot however I started this one not knowing anything about the characters or where the story would take me.  In that sense, Loving Frank was a particularly good read.  It's not the kind of book you can't put down but something does compel you to pick it back up to find out what happens next. Nancy Horan does not try to convince you to like her main characters.  She presents them entirely as they are and lets you decide for yourself.  Mamah is flawed but only as much as any other person.  You may not agree with the things she does, but in the end you understand why she had to do them.  One more thing to note is that the ending caught me completely by surprise.  Not knowing much about Frank Lloyd Wright's personal life, I would never have thought this to be the way Frank and Mamah's story ends.
1577314808|5.0|THE POWER OF NOW guides the reader to value and practice living (breathing, thinking, acting) in the present.  Gradually, as a person practices living in the present, painful memories and taunting thoughts are gently healed and the person is more free to experience the moment in which he/she is living. Also, living in the NOW prepares the person to deal with the future.    I believe that the practice of living in the present moment is a way of putting into practice the teaching offered by Christ in the gospels: be sure of your value as a person fashioned by a loving Creator, trust the Creator to be with you NOW and at every now.  In my mind this implies that living in the present moment we won't miss our Creator and we live out the trust that we were accompanied in the past and will be accompanied in the future by our loving, challenging Creator.

B001DEVZUG|5.0|There may not be a thousand songs in this collection but post-Eurythmics, Lennox has produced 4 albums spanning 15 years with songs that resonates so well with any real music lover. Heartfelt and often introspective, she has come a long way. Collected here are the songs and singles that made it big. From the seminal Why, Walking on Broken Glass, Little Bird to No More \\"I Love You's\\" and Wonderful, there's too much to mention. Listen to Why and tell me who the original Diva is. On Songs of Mass Destruction, there's the anthem Sing, a pledge to the AIDS cause featuring a whole host of female artists in pop tody. The videos are nothing short of spectacular except the badly-conjured Pavement Cracks mash-up video. Watch Why, Little Bird and Waiting in Vain and enough is said.<br /><br />For a true Lennox fan, this collection does not replace the joy of owning each of her 4 albums that offer so much more than you can ever find in music today. My favourite will be \\"The Saddest Song I've Got\\" from Bare, \\"Why\\" from Diva, \\"Downtown Lights\\" from Medusa and \\"Lost\\"from Destruction.<br /><br />For a good summary of Lennox's solo career thus far, The Annie Lennox Collection serves its purpose quite well.<br /><br />For hardcore fans, go for the British limited edition with a bonus B-sides CD and two extra videos (the two new songs) on the DVD.<br /><br />Package and selection: B<br />Content: A+
B0012GMX1K|4.0|The band continued to refine an already highly eccentric sound, emphasizing fast, quirky pianistic interplay and articulate vocal sculpting over the receding guitar-rock influence. The results may feel more obnoxious then their first two releases but in fact reveal a sound that much more oddly complete, an album to truly mark GG's distinction within the progressive community.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|The play-turned-movie Doubt has no doubts as to why all four actors were acknowledged for their acting chops at the Oscars. Fallen into the hands of lesser performers, Doubt would have been long and draggy. However, the stellar cast headed by Meryl Streep with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis is superb.<br /><br />From the very first scne where the no-nonsense and rigid Sister Aloysius Beauvier invokes fear in the kids attending Father Flynn's sermons, you know it will be one hell of a show. There's a lot of dialogue and at no time, you have clear evidence of the perpetrator's crime but the dramatic and extremely heated exchange between Streep and Hoffman in her office proves to us why Streep is one of the best actresses this century and why Hoffman won an Oscar a few years back. Amy Adams as Sister James is both precocious and perhaps the only one with doubt that Sister Aloysius is right in her accusations. Of course, the other scene stealer is Viola Davis with her short but impactful appearance as the mother of the boy victim (akin to Judi Dench's 8-minute run in Shakespeare in Love).<br /><br />Doubt is unquestionably one of the best films of 2008.

B000001FW9|3.0|3 1/2    Gentle Giant offered a regal kind of rock with a reputation which you hope adds up to the thinking man's progressive act. Plenty of moments can be cited as proof of that in this oddly calibrated mixture of classic, baroque, and art rock, and ATT is as seemingly solid as anything the band put out. Yet for all the impressiveness I always find myself asking for a little more then what is offered, with inspired passages all too often giving way to self-conscious minor-key embellishments.
B001HN6972|4.0|It almost seems like Kate Winslet has a penchant for appearing nude having done so in Titanic and Little Children. The first hour or so of The Reader might seem like soft-porn but seeing the raw passion between a 30-something Hanna Schmitz and her young teenage lover, Michael Berg (David Cross) is anything but a riveted and emotional ride.<br /><br />The Nazi backdrop is not so much a necessity but more of a setting. Much of the early part of the show has to do with the torrid affair, how Hanna loves being read to and then when Berg as a young law student meet Hanna after her unexplained disappearance, only to find her stand trial for her holocaust crimes.<br /><br />That is where the story gets more interesting as Hanna is actually an illiterate who's too ashamed to admit to her inadequacies. The adult Michael played by Ralph Fiennes shows great remorse and love for the by then elderly Hanna. What follows is a touching tale of transcendental love and heartache. Fiennes' hardhearted portrayal of the tormented adult Berg is both bittersweet and intense. Kate Winslet in her Oscar-nominated role as an elderly let-down woman finds new meaning in life with what she receives from Berg and starts her lifetime of hope from then until they met. Winslet is almost too deserving of the Oscar statute with this performance for all that she has missed out on for the past 5 times.<br /><br />In the end, you find this show a tearjerker that will touch every nerve in your body.

B00005OM4K|5.0|I think pricewise,the casual fan is going to get \\"Green River\\", \\"Cosmo's Factory\\"  and \\"Willy and the Poor Boys\\", or the 2 Chronicles, all of which are great. The individual rereleases exclude \\"Mardi Gras\\" even though there are some great songs on there. They all have bonus cuts, most of which are on the box set.     I know that since this release, John Fogerty has rejoined Concord/Fantasy, so he's put out a collection of CCR and solo songs (\\"The Long Road Home\\" which is great if you like \\"Centerfield\\" and \\"Blue Moon Swamp\\", one I'd get for newbies who want to see him live, and gives you a taste of him involved in the 40th anniv. remasters)    I recently got this because the price came down, and is a fairly complete collection of their music. If you happen to get the Woodstock CD box set, you'll find 99 1/2, Commotion, I Put A Spell On You, and Green River, which to me would've been a nice addition but worth having in its own right (not sure if there's any CCR footage from Woodstock though).     But this collection is where you can hear them developing from a garage rock band with the style of the day into something that sounds nothing like their Bay Area peers except the \\"jams\\" and feedback, there's one or two on the first CD that have been part of the Nuggets box set. From the second disc on the songs are familiar and covers all the albums. The last 2 discs are mostly live, but you can tell the difference between when they were a quartet vs playing as a three piece.     The booklet is a nice,lengthy read that talks about the history of the band with some early pics of the band starting out and some memorabilia in there as well.     I would get this, because with Fogerty part of the label again and having not rereleased \\"Mardi Gras\\", it's possible this one could wind up out of print.

B0015UKX7Y|5.0|I'm nineteen years old, and I hate most current music with a fiery passion. I'm an avid fan of classic rock, and I hardly listen to any music that came out after the 70s. Having said that, this is one of three new bands whose music I actually enjoy.    I'm not a musician. This isn't a review of how the album sounded technically, or about how the influences of this, that, and the other can clearly be heard. I don't know about any of that. All I know is that this music is wonderful. It obviously has influences from older music, but it's also completely original. It's so completely different from all the drivel that the radio and television stations try to cram down my throat. Alex and Miles are brilliant songwriters, and the instrumentation is absolutely beautiful. I can listen to \\"The Meeting Place\\" or \\"Time Has Come Again\\" over and over. Overall, this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I'm so glad Alex and Miles got on so well and decided to record together, and I hope they continue with The Last Shadow Puppets for a long time to come.    I'd like to bring up something that bothered me as I read the reviews. Alex is NOT the only member in the band, and he's not any more important than Miles. Most of the reviews talk about how great Alex is, or compare this album with Arctic Monkeys, but Miles was hardly mentioned at all. I know Alex is more famous, but they did this together. They wrote the songs together, they both sang, and they both played instruments. They made the album because they're best friends and they like the same music, and it aggravates me to no end when people refer to The Last Shadow Puppets as \\"the side project of Alex Turner.\\" They're both in other bands, that doesn't make this a side project. Sorry if this turned into a rant, but I would like to see Miles get some credit and attention for a change.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Elton John already has three of the most essential greatest hits albums out on the market but for people only interested in making one purchase, this is definitely their best choice.  Even more so than the \\"To Be Continued\\" box set, this collection of hits spans his entire career...and I do mean entire career...all 30 years of it.  Note that this doesn't have anything post-\\"Songs From The West\\" Coast as this set was compiled during the early 00s.  Also this doesn't have anything from Empty Sky or before since he didn't have any hits back-then.    Let me stress that this is strickly a hits collection.  Don't expect to find album tracks that weren't released as singles. Example: pretty much everything off of \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\".  In a way, this is a shame because Elton was more than just the hits.   Tracks like \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\", \\"Madman Across The Water\\", and \\"Funeral For A Friend\\" are just as much favorites with the fans as \\"Rocket Man\\" and \\"Candle With The Wind\\".  I know that a third disc would be needed to accompany all these additional tracks but the fact that two discs isn't enough just shows how prolific Elton John's career has been.  For casual fans and even many loyal fans, this is enough.  However, anyone else who want's to know more about what made Elton John one of the most beloved artists of the 70s and 80s is probably going to have to look into purchasing the individual albums: most notably the concept albums like \\"Tumbleweed\\".      This is still a nice overview though.  Its interesting how John went from being a singer-songwriter to a glam rock icon and then to an adult contemporary artist.  In fact this will divide some listeners.  People who enjoy the rock material might wear out the first disc before ever touching the second.  This the only place you'll find \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" along with \\"The Lion King\\" soundtrack.    This package definitely lives up to its name as a greatest hits package.  It's just that there was so much music that EltonJohn made.  A two disc set simply doesn't tell the whole story.  Accept this a sampler if you're new to his music and if you like it, check out his other albums.  You won't be dissapointed.
B000068OCS|5.0|Released in the early 80s, but watched just last night.<br /><br />Those who have seen K probably agree it is even more relevant today (and will be another 25 years from now, assuming we haven't blown ourselves back to the Stone Age).<br /><br />I got the movie from Netflix only because Philip Glass, one of my Deserted Island musicians, wrote its music. I wondered at the odd title, and wondered what the movie would be about.<br /><br />Trying not to spoil your own experience, let me say only that:<br />-- the movie can be equally enjoyed no matter what language you speak<br />-- it should not be watched while tired (the beginning is relaxing to the point of curing insomnia), and<br />-- it demands a widescreen HDTV but with the glorious audio coming out of your sound system.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|Some of the more melodic singing of Springsteen's career.  While apparently light on the surface, the lyrics reveal far more substance upon repeated listens and inspection.
B000002G87|5.0|So many have written superb reviews of this album its music the underlying themes and causes that brought this music to fruition. I was 16 when this album hit the music stores just starting the first of many Rock bands I would be a part of over the years. The other guitar player and I would sit in AWE as we listened to the interaction betwen Clapton and Allman as they spun higher and higher into an atmosphere most guitar players can only dream of and few ever attain!! There are so many reasons to have this album in your collection I won't list them all, but if you ever dreamed of playing guitar, play guitar, or you are thinking about starting this would be the place to start to be able to emulate the emotions that these two superb guitar players evoke with ever soaring notes and riffs each pushing the other to heights the other would very seldom ever acheive again is enough to make this album a part of any collection!!!!  If some of these songs don't bring tears to your eyes with emotion then you must already be dead!!!! ONE OF THE BEST!!! I actually bought 4 copies of this on vinyl I wore the first three out!!! This album along with Dark Side of the Moon, Eat a Peach, Led Zep II, Fragile, All Things Must Pass,In the Court of the Crimson KIng and Bitches Brew are never far from the click wheel of my Ipod
B001BGTWXI|5.0|Everyone knows slipknot from the past as the hardcore metal band that made music that only seemed to address rage. that is, nine members in masks, screaming until the throat bleeds, strumming at light speed at distortion level 10 thousand, and beating the cymbals & double foot pedal so fast the mind struggles to comprehend it. all that equals a riotous, verbal and instrumental massacre of what any non-hardcore metal fan wouldn't even classify as music. i sure dont (with the exception of the subliminal verses). but now slipknot's full out 4 year  effort to create something that more people can actually appreciate has paid off. Anyone who likes iowa, don't even consider this album. you will just end up insulting slipknot. but anyone who has enough sense to appreciate a maturing band's introduction of variety, dynamics, REAL solos, singles worthy of impressing those who dont like their ears bleeding, and even a BALLAD. yeah, take a breath... will be impressed. i'll compare slipknot's evolution to avenged sevenfold's. everyone thinks hardcore mind numbing violence is awesome, honestly, for most, it loses novelty quickly. both of the bands realized that, and in a painstaking effort, released new albums that, if it weren't for the introduction songs, you would think it was a different band. so for those thinking the brutal introduction of AHIG is indicating the nature of the rest of the album, think again. Every song truly is different, and good. and because slipknot turned the intensity level, from the stratosphere, you can really tell! the tempo in particular never stays the same. Dead memories and psychosocial are the most creative tracks of the whole album, and they are on the radio. The rest are right up there. And the selling point for me wih this album was slipknot's  ability to finally create something meaningful. Songs that people are gonna remember. It grows on me more every time. They expanded their portfolio in both directions of intensity, slightly up for some songs, WAY down for others. but the experimentation reequired for a band to keep or get  people interested is what its all about. 5 stars
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great title at a great price for the BluRay series. Amazon dropped the price for a day to $36 and sold a great many of these -- I think. I saw a post on Engadget and was still able to get a copy at 1145PM the night the sale ended.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|After reading Roger Ebert's review of QUANTUM OF SOLACE - the super-critic who gave this film a C rating - I had to determine whether or not I agreed. I didn't. To be sure, I watched this film four times.<br /><br />Gone are the juvenile quips and the soundtrack jokes we came to identify with Roger Moore's interpretation of the Ian Fleming British agent (in his films, the producers descended to the level of using soundtrack themes of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and even CALIFORNIA GIRLS to provide \\"humor\\"). I like Roger Moore (in such serious films as THE WILD GEESE), but as James Bond he was the worst. Many times in his films, a character tells Bond that his reputation has preceded him. If this were the case (as Roger Moore himself remarked in an interview), what would his value be as a secret agent? Why not just give him a Batman costume (although THE DARK KNIGHT makes a Batman story more gritty and cruel than many Bond films)?<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan was probably the second-worst Bond, followed by model George Lazenby. Unfortunately, Lazenby plays Bond in the longest (running time) and one of the best of the Bond stories. Fortunately, he only played 007 once.<br /><br />Many people believe that Sean Connery was the best Bond ever. Yes, he was superb in DOCTOR NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. After GOLDFINGER, however, he became too cutsy with his remarks and the directors each became increasingly sloppy. THUNDERBALL has some horrible post-dubbing in a couple of the scenes. DIAMOND ARE FOREVER is so awful that it hardly deserves mention. Only NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN redeems Connery somewhat in a come-back role. He got rid of the one-liners and faced probably the best-acted villain ever, but he was saddled with a remake of THUNDERBALL for the story instead of something original.<br /><br />Timothy Dalton was a bit slight in stature for the role, but he was probably the most believable 007. He was hampered with a few of the one-liner quips that Roger Moore loved to bring off as well as some Three Stooges antics (a car carrying a barn along on the ice, for example), but his serious take on the role was refreshing. It is unfortunate that he only made two of the 007 films because he was reportedly uncomfortable in the role, but his discomfort was not evident on the screen.<br /><br />Daniel Craig re-writes the role of Bond as a comparatively unsophisticated, non-elitist, violent secret agent, an actor who might appear as comfortable in a car mechanic's work uniform as in a tuxedo. The producers Broccoli (Cubby's daughter) and Wilson evidently decided to start over with the franchise and re-envision Bond as a serious, relentless, emotionally damaged, and occasionally scar-faced 007. Gone are the horrible quips with double meanings, gone are the Q branch gimmicks (replaced by equally effective communication technology accessed by his versatile cell phone), and the romantic clinch endings. This Bond doesn't end up in bed with the very capable main heroine, although he does make a sheet sandwich with a tall but inexperienced British worker who gets the GOLDFINGER treatment with oil instead of gold paint. The only clich&eacute; here is that the secondary heroine is again iced after her bedtime exchange with Bond.<br /><br />Craig does have an extended fight scene with the self-admitted nasty little villain, a scene during an oil fire that is inter-cut with a struggle between the heroine, Camille, and the sadistic dictator general who molested and killed her mother and sister. Craig doesn't really kill the villain as Bond usually does in a spectacular finale. He, in a sense, does something worse, and what Camille does to the general is more than women usually do to men with whom they are fighting. Kicking the villain in the groin is one thing (which she does do), but what she also does to him in the same area of his anatomy is hair-raising, daring, and appropriate in the revenge department.<br /><br />Presenting QUANTUM OFSOLACE as a direct continuation of CASINO ROYALE is inspired. We have new heroines, but the Felix Leiter role, the arch-villain named White, and the misunderstood but forgiving Italian agent named Mathis continue as if the first film never ended. Forget the fact that this Bond is blond. Who cares? Don't you know that we blonds supposedly have more fun? Although having more fun does not appear to be big on Daniel Craig's list.<br /><br />If you want a cartoonish Bond who dispenses cheap laughs, go back and watch the Moore or Brosnan versions. If you want a tough Bond for a tough new age post 9-11, see Daniel Craig in CASINO ROYALE and its direct sequel QUANTUM OF SOLACE. He does not look like someone you would immediately identify as a suave secret agent, which is what makes him more effective than his predecessors.<br /><br />Dr. Charles J.

B000BKVQTS|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  We turned it off halfway through and I have no desire to ever know what happened in the end.  It's not funny.  It's gross, disgusting and repulsive and has not one redeeming quality that I can think of.  Do yourself a favor and skip it.<br /><br />If you want a good fairy tale based movie with some intelligence, try [[ASIN:B00006G8H3 The Company of Wolves]].
B001FB4W0W|2.0|This show seems to have some weird (vampiric gaze?) over viewers that misleads them into thinking it is a great show.  It could have been so much more, but being rooted in the bad source material  is it's greatest foil, I'd have to say.  Some of the acting, including the star, is below what I'd expect from a show with a budget this large.  As a regular HBO subscriber I was looking forward to this show; only to be bored by episode three at the inane plot and meaningless direction of many of the characters and the MTV/slasher/rockstar depiction of some of the 'bad' vampires.    A far better choice would have been to use the extremely superior Ann Rice series or Fevre Dream for a vampire setting; True Blood truly stinks.    HBO, oh how the mighty have fallen. The Wire: gone. Deadwood: Gone. The Sopranos: Fuhgetaboutit.  Hopefully they'll redeem themselves with The Pacific later this year and with A Song of Ice and Fire in the future.
0920668364|1.0|I agree, this is the weirdest book I've ever read.  My lesson learned is never read a book to other kids before you read it.  I thought the crawling on the floor was WEIRD, the picking him up even at 9---WEIRD, the teenage part WEIRDER and when I got to the page with the ladder on the car I stopped reading, read it to myself and then proceeded by skipping those pages to the end where he's with his own daughter.  This book is just WEIRD and not appropriate!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I owned the DVD version of this, the most important mini-series ever. So when it arrive on Blu-ray, it was a must-buy. High definition greatly benefits the beautiful cinematography. The gritty, grainy look of the series comes across more clearly than on the DVD version.    The new Blu-ray exclusive features are well worth the price. The picture-in-picture commentaries--which draw from interviews with the actual Easy Company soldiers that never made it into the previously seen documentary or episode intros--provide insight into the scenes over which they appear. And the interactive timeline feature further enhances the viewing will all kinds of extra information.    In fact, my wife and I are enjoying our evenings spent watching an episode, then going back and watching it with the commentaries, then going back and running through the interactive timeline.
0525951113|5.0|The scariest scenarios are things that could really happen. I'm not a gamer, nor a particularly technical person, but I was so riveted by the \\"what if?\\" aspect of this book that my boyfriend had to compete for my attention during our tropical vacation. And he's hot.    My only regret about owning this book is having to loan it out; I am sure I will never see it again as it makes the rounds of my geek friends.
0143035711|5.0|I picked this book up when I was a U.S. Army vehicle mechanic in Germany in the mid '80s. First off I will admit I was a HUGE helicopter fanatic. This book intrigued me so much that I literally read it in 2 or 3 sessions. And I hated reading in high school and have not completed one book cover to cover since then. Except this one. O.K. to the point. This book takes you through the initial WOC school and wonderfully describes  Mr. Mason's trials and tribulations there, and to the flightline and through graduation and all. But the real draw to me was the incredible detail Mr. Mason goes into about the actual FLYING of the helicopter. He explains all the controls and how they function together and what effect each one has on the others. He really paints the picture of the dificulty it is to keep one of these things under control. Also describing certain \\"tricks\\" used in the field like running take-offs when you are overloaded or if the heat or altitude is severe. Plus his whole account of the missions he flew in Viet Nam and what the pilots lives' were like over there. To cut this off, I will just say that if you love helicopters and stop to watch them everytime you hear one coming overhead, like I do, this book will be highly enjoyed! I promise.
B001FOPODS|5.0|I bought this spur of the moment because of the cover art. It just looked cool. I admit I almost didn't buy it because it's a pretty short story, and I paid full price. But it was so worth it. I'd pay three times that for it now that I've seen it.    I understand that this may not be the exact Peter and the Wolf story that some of the reviewers were expecting. It is, however, a very good story just as it is. It is a story of understanding, consequence, and acceptance.    And visually...wow. I'm not usually that impressed with visuals. It's just not what I focus on. But this is beautiful.    I'm so glad I own this.
B001FEA9QU|5.0|First things first:  The sound quality has turned so many people off of this album I thought I'd like to at least address it up front.  It's not too great.  Yes, apparently it's quite clip happy, like just about any major release today.  If you're an audiophile, you will not like the sound.  (The Guitar Hero III rip alleviates some of these problems, so search it out if you're holding back buying the cd)<br /><br />However, I want to focus on the music of Death Magnetic, not necessarily the way in which it was mastered.  This is the missing album between AJFA and \\"Black\\" that I always wanted.  I never felt there was a true transition period between the two.  ...And Justice For All is my favorite album of all time...not Metallica album, OVERALL, in all of music.  So to say I was dumbfounded when Enter Sandman hit the radio would be an understatement.  In fact, I was right pissed for years.  I dug some of Load, but to my surprise, the heavier hard rock songs weren't the songs I enjoyed.  I enjoyed the softer songs like Bleeding Me and The Outlaw Torn much more than King Nothing or 2 x 4.  And on I went through the 90's, waiting for Metallica to give me what I deserved, a proper Justice followup.  It did not appear.  ST Anger, for all I liked about that album, I found just as much to dislike, rendering it average.<br /><br />Death Magnetic comes at a time where I have found peace with Metallica and had all but given up on hearing the classic Metallica sound.  So I immediately buy the CD and pop it in my truck stereo.  I am completely bombarded with awesome riffage and thundering double bass from the first song on the last.  I love the first song so much, I keep driving around to listen to what's next.  This continues for over an hour until the last notes of \\"My Apocalypse\\" end.  I hop out of my truck, smiling that I finally have a Justice to Black transfer album.  I judge if a Metallica song is a classic by determining which of the songs I would want to hear during a encore at a concert.  I can honestly say there are 5 vintage Metallica stone cold classics on Death Magnetic.  \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", \\"Broken Beat and Scarred\\", \\"All Nightmare Long\\", \\"The Judas Kiss\\" and \\"My Apocalypse\\".  In my book, an album by a band this huge, over 25 years in the business and is still hugely relevant, to release an album of 10 songs with 5 being immediate classics is just about unbelievable, but they've done it.<br /><br />I have two minor qualms with the album, and it's The Unforgiven III and The Day That Never Comes.  While I think The Unforgiven III is a great song on its own, it doesn't truly fit the album, especially where it's slotted.  And on the Day That Never Comes, I wish a vocal performance was laid over some of the final 3+ minutes of the song when the guitars just go insane.<br /><br />Other than that though, you're looking at a top 5 Metallica album.  You can say it's fifth, but I wouldn't have a problem putting it as high as 3rd either.  As with all Metallica records, it will come down to mood or personal preference in that moment you're deciding which to listen to, but ultimately Death Magnetic will be  a legit option, something I haven't been able to say about a new Metallica CD in 17 years.cert.

B001H5X7I4|2.0|I was really hoping with a cast like they had, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr, etc that this movie would be hilarious, but they missed the target in every way with this movie. I love these types of movies, but this one was a wreck from the start and I won't even comment on Tom Cruise's character... that bad. It should be called Tropic Blunder... you'll want to give it a chance but probably will want to turn it off after the first 30 minutes after you realize you haven't laughed once yet while watching a comedy! Give us something better Hollywood!
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|The major part of Woody Allen's body of cinematic work considers sexual matters bordering the perverse.  \\"Vicki Christina Barcelona\\" is more of the same, but done, as always in Allen films, deftly.  The absurdity of the situations was amusing, and I found myself smiling frequently during the film.  Penelope Cruz was outstanding among a number of good performances.  As a guitarist I appreciated the partial renditions of \\"Granada\\" and \\"Leyenda\\" in the background.
B001PP9ALY|3.0|I agree with the some of the other reviewers that this movie while exciting ultimately was more in the nature of a live action cartoon. After a while the  blood sort of got to me, though it was not violent in the sense of heads being chopped off. Just lots of shooting.

B00012QM8G|5.0|The emotions aroused by this movie are varied. One feels loathing for the evil Nazis who treat Jews like animals for the slaughter; admiration for the courage of Oskar Schindler and the few who help him rescue over 1,000 Jews; and a bit of wonder that a man who was obviously no saint (he was  a womanizer, materialist and member of the Nazi party) would risk his life and fortune to help those who would otherwise be sent to the slaughter. It goes to show that goodness is to be found in the hearts of all kinds of people, not just those of great religious faith and virtue.<br /><br />Perhaps the most moving part of this film is the very end, where we see many of the Jews who are alive today (i.e., at the time the movie was made) walking by Schindler's grave in Israel and dropping flowers on it. I was overwhelmed thinking that none of those people would have been there if Schindler hadn't put his neck on the line for them. It brought tears to my eyes to see them paying their respects to the man who made it possible for them to be there.<br /><br />A follow-up book titled [[ASIN:0452273536 Schindler's Legacy: True Stories of the List Survivors]] was published in 1994. It tells us about the lives of a number of the people who were saved thanks to Schindler. Some went on to become pillars of society, others to lead rather ordinary lives, and some to lead somewhat messy lives. But you know what the most important thing is? THEY GOT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES! Just like the rest of us, they had a chance to get on with the business of living. Just like the rest of us, some did better than others; some made good choices and some made poor choices. But the important thing is that they had the opportunity. Their lives were not snuffed out in some Nazi death camp. Oskar Schindler gave them the chance to do like the rest of us are doing: just living. That, my friends, was something worth doing!
B000002KIE|5.0|I stumbled across the Sex Pistols by chance while riding with a friend who had \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" on a mixed disc. I liked it so I checked out the album and was instantly enthralled by its tracks and purchased Bollocks immediately.     Johnny Rottens raw vocals, to me, are what give the Sex Pistols their gnarly almost dirty feeling bang, and its that raw edge that I think scares people off. Personally I think every track on this album is great. I dont think there is a trully weak song on it.      Also in the current musical atmosphere where music sounds so artifical its refreshing to revert back to a band who didn't care what anybody thought and sang about things that mattered to them.     Point is, I would recommend this album and all other Sex Pistols work to anybody. The Sex Pistols did trully create something remarkable here that seems to be greatly under appreciated by alot of folks. Their a band i'll definetly carry with me for the long haul.     Buy this album!
B001NY42KQ|5.0|High School Musical 3 is finally here and it's available on a dvd with many bonus feature!  This is a very unforgettable movie as it is the last High School Musical with the original cast.  The producers went all out there with the movie and used a lot of their budget.  It was all worth it!  The sets, the fireworks, the choreography, etc are all what makes this movie very unique!  This movie shows the hopes and fears of graduating, but no matter what, you'll always have your friends and family by your side.  If you are a devoted fan, this movie is for you to purchase!  It is the best of all 3!  The music is all very catchy and clean so everyone can enjoy it!  This movie is definitely worth any penny.  As Troy Bolton once said, \\"Once a Wildcat, always a wildcat!\\"

This book was bad...and a horrible conclusion to a pretty great series.<br />While I had many qualms about this book most (as I said above) are mentioned so I'm going to take this oppurtunity to say something I enjoyed about this book: Jacob's perspective.<br />I hate Jacob, and have never been a fan of his but I congratulate SM on putting it in. It seemed like she really enjoyed writing from someone else's POV and it was funny, sarcastic and sad in all the right points. It made the middle of Breaking Dawn really enjoyable, enough so that I could continue on and finish reading Bella's disturbing and cold ending.
1433502410|4.0|I received this bible as a Christmas gift. I am new to the ESV and picked this translation after months deliberation. The ESV is a literal translation but is quite easy to read. You need to consult a dictionary every now and then but all in all it has become my preferred translation (studied mostly in NIV, also tried NKJV and though I liked the NLT- I missed the majesty of some ofthe text particularly the Psalms). The commentary and study notes were eye openers- some were redundant but overall very helpful. This study bible had the most detailed rendering of the tabernacle I have seen - you sort of have an idea of how it looked in your brain but it looks totally different in an artist rendering - it also makes the whole reading of Leviticus more meaningful. I got the hardbound edition and am thinking of geting the leather bound version later. THIS IS A HEAVY BIBLE which makes it not practical to carry - I have a thinline ESV bible to carry - which by the way I am also very pleased.  All in all, it is the best study  bible I have owned - and for an ordinary person -I've owned a lot.
1439136653|5.0|I have seen the movie first and read the book latter. Loved both of them. Which version is closer to reality? Both! Frankly, the director retold the story in a version palatable to the west.    First, why do I consider both versions to be closer to reality - In the book, there is a gay priest and a priest with a secret marriage. My hometown in Andhra Pradesh, India had both of them or quite a few of them. As kids, we were aware of teenagers getting gifts and foreign cigarrettes from this gay italian priest. And there is the priest who had sexual relations with the maid and supporting her family with cash. In the movie, the girl Latika getting scarred on her face, although throwing acid is more common in real life.    Vikas Swarup choose to tell the story in a very plain language, the few metaphors used in the book, I suspect were slipped in by the editors. He borrowed the story telling style from RK Narayan's \\"Guide\\", which starts in the middle of the story line, goes the beginning and then the end. Vikas took it to a whole new level by weaving the story between different episodes of the protagonists life in 13 chapters. The author included plenty of observations he made in his life. Every Indian has seen domestic child labor (as maids), blind kids begging on a busy street corner, police brutality etc. There is so much misery around, an average indian gets immune to it. Vikas was courageous enought to write about it and tell a gripping story too.    The author also borrowed a few items from Indian movies, like the double headed coin (from the movie Sholay). Is Neelima Kumari the real life actress Meena Kumari, or is it Parvin Bhabi who committed suicide? My suspicion is, the author borrowed a lot from his observations as a diplomat, world traveller and as an Indian. He wove them into a beautiful story, a wonderful fabric with many colors, details and designs.    It is a shame that this books did not win awards. Boring, long drawn books by indian authors won pulitzers. I guess, they were heavily promoted or had guiding hands from their parents who were 3rd class writers. It also tells a lot about the book reviewers. It took Danny Boyle to recognize the book and create a gem of a movie.    Having said that, except the story telling style, there is no commonality between the movie and the book. The book is very secular, from the protagonist's name \\"Ram Mohammed Thomas\\" to the misery around him. Secular that there is misery and deceit from the priests to the nefarious creatures who blind children, from westerners to indians, from rich to poor. This is missing in the movie. I suspect the changes were made in the movie for two reasons. One, to make it palatable to the western audience such as removing references to gay priests from England or to australlian diplomats running a spy ring. Second, Lovely Tandon (the co-director) and Anil Kapoor (game show host) Bollywoodised the movie with a \\"heroine\\" and also making the role of Prem Kumar the game show host a less nefarious charachter. With the galaxy size egos in Bollywood, it is not unimaginable that Anil Kapoor has demanded a modification of his charachter.    Except for the protaganits winning the money, the movie is a documentary of the plight of the under privlleged kids world wide, not only Indian. It is the story of Ismael Beah in Congo or any other kid in projects close to Manhattan or Chicago.    Two problems with the movie - The scene where Jamaal jumps into human excrement was unnecessary and not in the book. This is what angered most indians, both rich and poor. The second, in all the movies that I have seen so far, only the Hindus are shown attacking Muslims during a religious riot. The truth is, it is more complex. There are idiots on all sides creating trouble for the peace loving majority. I guess, the movie makers are just plain afraid to show a muslim being the perpetrator of a riot.     Other items I see as a correlation to real life are observations from my own experience as a kid: One of my neighbhours, a beautiful young doctor was abused by her husband, a drunk. Only when she committed suicide the rumor spread that she had cigarrette burns all over her body. Second, babies stolen from government hospitals to be sold to beggar mafia, Atleast there are news reports once in a while about stolen babies. You cannot round a busy street without encountering a girl with a drugged baby begging for money. Third, Guides in any tourist spot through out the world giving wonderfully altered versions of the history.     Next, street kids being smarter than kids going to school. There was this nine yeal old banana seller on the street who I met in my hometown a couple of years ago. You should see the sharpness of his mind to be believed, he can not only calculate the profit margin in %, prices, hedging against prices from the wholesale market, interest rates from the money lender a school kid cannot. It is needed for his survival. My family volunteered to pay for his education. He shouted back he makes Rs. 120 a day and has a sick mother, a young sister to feed. Who will earn the money if he goes to school? We tried to talk to him several times after that, but his assessment of the daily needs of his family were as accurate his math.     So, this is a documentary, not a fiction.    Contrast this to booksmart kids from middle class and rich class. It was nicely contrasted in the book, when Akshay a middle class kid knows that there is no Sony PS3 yet (2004), but gives away the survival skill of Ram Mohammed Thomas hiding cash in his underwear.    Great movie, great book.     Now, the ugliest of the ugliest truths, worse than the exploitation detailed in the movie - Child actors who played the roles of Salim and Latika, who were originally from the slums are paid a pittance. Danny Boyle and Fox movies did a PR stunt saying three times the local daily wages was paid. So, is it 150 rupees a day, 3 dollars a day? Sure they can have done a lotbetter than that. Money deoposited in the bank for the actors to cash out when they turn 18? How much was deposited? The truth needs to come out. The children and their families cannot live in a 6ftx6ft dwelling and lead the same life of daily survival as a challenge, waiting for some one to turn 18.     So, who is the best actor in the movie? The young Salim without any question. Better than Benjamin Button and Milk and 18 year Dev Patel combined. He deserves a better living, atleast after he demonstrated his artistic talent.
0441009425|5.0|When Robert A. Heinlein passed away, I wondered who could fill the shoes of a writer I enjoyed since childhood.  Larry Niven has taken the job with his enjoyable Known Space stories and other novels.  However, boosterspice doesn't seem to be around the corner, so who will inherit the throne from Niven? After reading three novels in the \\"Revelation Space\\" universe, I've decided the most likely heir is Alastair Reynolds.<br /><br />The books are space opera, mostly set half a millennium, give or take, in the future.  Humans have reached the stars, but in ships that obey Einstein's laws, so it wasn't easy.  The intrigue among the various factions (and forms) of humans is more complex than in Dune.  (The universe is not an empire, what with no instantaneous travel or anything).  Some humans are quite weird by our own standards, or even compared to *aliens* in other novels.  The few sentient aliens encountered (with one exception) are far weirder--and are mostly not a threat since they don't require the same resources as humans.  In fact, the most dangerous entities in space (with one exception) are certain other humans.<br /><br />The books are full of future technology--think of the things at the edge of development right now, such as nanotechnology, bioengineering, computation, etc. and take them to their natural 500 year or so limits, and not only that, look at how humanity adapts to technology as technology adapts to humanity.  Immortality occurs often in SF, but somewhat less often we find stories rich in the consequences of it, such as boredom pushing immortals to hire assassins...for themselves!<br /><br />There are new kinds of evils, and old kinds in new forms.  It's not so much good versus evil as lesser evils against greater evils and the best not completely innocent.  Then there are the evil in deed but not intent--few SF writers would tackle the possibility that wiping out life throughout a galaxy could be for the greater good...from a certain very alien point of view.<br /><br />I was impressed by the accuracy concerning stellar, quantum, and relativistic physics, as well as biology, chaos, etc.  Some liberties are taken (mostly with super-advanced alien technology who presumably have the quantum gravity and extensions thereof that we lack) and some currently-speculative physics ideas appear.was impressed by the accuracy concerning stellar, quantum, and relativistic physics, as well as biology, chaos, etc.  Some liberties are taken (mostly with super-advanced alien technology who presumably have the quantum gravity and extensions thereof that we lack) and some currently-speculative physics ideas appear.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Just bought a second pair. Here's the short and sweet  Pros.  1. Cannot find a better value for the price  2. Very good sound quality. Blocks external sound decently.  3. Bass holds. I was surprised.  4. Very light.  well made. Its a SONY afterall  5. Will not fall during running. The buds that came with Ipod will not stay in the ear....at least not my ear  Cons.  1. None in my experience  2. Few reviewers report loosing sound in one side after 3-6 months. Hasn't happened to me but if it does. I'll throw it and buy another  one.  Bottom line:  If your ipod buds dont stay in your ear while running...this is one of the best solutions
031606792X|1.0|I loved Twilight and generally enjoyed books 2 and 3.  Suspending belief is not usually difficult for me but during the reading of Breaking Dawn, the only belief that was suspended was, \\"How could she write this lame story?\\"  In my opinion, it was disjointed, characters suddenly acted out of character, and connections from the previous books were not successfully created.  When the author btried to tie loose ends together, it seemed contrived and too far-fetched.
0375842209|4.0|I had picked this up a few months ago to read but couldn't get into it. Attending a new book club was my motivation to try again. I'm glad I did!    The story is narrated by Death. Death is neither good nor evil, it just is. Death normally doesn't pay attention to the living - trying to focus on the souls gathered and the colors they provide. The setting is Germany leading up to and including World War II. Thus, Death is quite busy. But Death has three encounters with Liesel Meminger, the Book Thief, during that time frame.    Liesel lives with her foster family. Her brother dies on the train during the trip to the foster family. At his funeral she picks up a book that falls from the grave digger's pocket. Death witnesses this theft. The thing is, Liesel can't read. Death continues her story of how Liesel learns to read, to love words, to love people, living a very hard life in Nazi Germany. Throw in a Jewish man hiding in the basement, the war, an accordian-playing foster father and it's quite a story.    Author Markus Zusak has written other books that are all categorized as young adult fiction. The Book Thief is also categorized young adult in the United States. While I think teens would definitely enjoy and learn from this story, I think the young adult designation may do the book a bit of a disservice. Some people just discount all young adult books in general - not a good choice, imo, but true nonetheless. And those folks are definitely going to miss out on a very good book by it being classified as young adult.    One warning I have for the book - the beginning is confusing. At least it was for me. I think that's why the first time I picked it up I didn't get very far. It's difficult at first to understand how Death talks, to know what it all means. I'm telling you to push through it. It will get better and you will get to read a unique book that will keep you thinking. And you will definitly enjoy it!
B000YABYLA|1.0|If you enjoy fantastical films that break from reality, then you may enjoy this film. Otherwise you will have to suspend what you know of the authentic world around you.    For example, to find this film worth watching, you must accept that:    *16-year-old high school girls speak like 30-year-old women  *16-year-old high school girls are more interested in sex than 16-year-old high school boys  *16-year-old high school girs are experts concerning home pregrancy tests and abortion clinics but know nothing about pre-natal care and the stages of pregnancy  *and so on...    A clue to how bad this film is can be found in the cast listing. Ever since The West Wing, Allison Janney seems to only get involved with mentally bankrupt, empty, idealogical projects that tend to promote narcissistic behavior. I think she is a wonderful actress, but I wish she would be more discriminating in what she chooses for work.

B00003CX9W|2.0|My parents took me to see Fantasia when I was 5 years old & I was overwhelmed by the experience. Some years ago (how many?) it was reissued in theaters & I saw it again but only remember that I got a blooming headache. I don't remember any \\"intermission\\" that another reviewer refers to & there is none in the VHS copy I have.<br /><br />Now I am 73, & seeing it on TV cannot of course begin to compare with seeing it in a theater. The opening sequences of fanciful fairies, flowers, etc are very satisfying & entertaining & I have remembered Mickey Mouse's bit as the \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" clearly & enjoyed it again though of course for a 5 year old child it would be very much more spectacular - on the TV it was just another well-done animation.<br /><br />But at 73 I have of course an altered perception from what I had as a child & much of the remaining animation quite frankly appears simplistic to me by today's standards. I am not impressed at 73 by the \\"scientific\\" viewpoint set to Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring\\" (pseudo-science, in my opinion), & cavorting hippos & gators etc are a waste of time to look at as far as I'm concerned. I was totally unimpressed by the idiotic mythology that for me spoiled Beethoven's \\"Pastorale\\" symphony & \\"A Night On Bald Mountain\\" was of course not the nightmarish experience it had been for me as a child.<br /><br />But then again - how can any TV acreen (unless it's gigantic perhaps) begin to compare with a theater screen? It cannot. And at 73 maybe at least part of me is a \\"grumpy old man.\\"
0515141429|4.0|This book was highly recommended to me and I found it to be a pretty good read.  I liked the plot but the main character was a little bigger than life.  If you want a fictional book to be realistic, the plot actually was believable and you start thinking this could happen.  However, I felt the main character was disproportionate (superhuman) to reality which takes a little away from the validity of the story overall.  That being said, I still would recommend the book.  It moves quickly and I had no problem staying very interested as the story unfolds.  I could not guess either the plot or outcome so it kept my interest throughout.

1400076943|5.0|\\"Purple Hibiscus\\" is Nigerian writer Chimamanda Adichie's award winning debut novel. I read its follow up, \\"Half Of A Yellow Sun\\" when it came out two years ago, and was totally enthralled by that novel; its story, the texture of the words, and the history of Nigeria told hand in hand with the fictional characters.<br /><br />\\"Purple Hibiscus\\" is in a similar mould, real life events in Nigeria (Corrupt civilian government toppled by a coup, a military leader whose wife was rumoured to have drug links, a dictator that died atop a prostitute) occur alongside a fictional narrative of a wealthy Enugu-based family of four, seemingly perfect and over-achieving to everyone on the outside, but like most families with some dark secrets.<br /><br />Its lead character is Kambili who along with her brother Jaja are shown by their widowed free spirited and opinionated aunt, that there is another life besides the gloomy and tense one they know dictated by their unbending father. Sadly enough, I sense that despite it all, their father does love them all but is himself battling some demons of his own which cause him to relate to his family in the way he does. I know it is difficult to feel any empathy for him but he seems like a lost soul.<br /><br />Much like \\"Half Of A Yellow Sun\\", I find the book features a weak female character (who grows stronger), an admired female character, a charismatic and unbending male character, and some family conflict. At many points in the story, I felt a sting in my eyes as loads of issues raised in the book are so true in Nigeria today, and I truly related with what Kambili and Jaja had to endure, and the inner conflict they felt. Their father, like lots of Nigerians, displayed a seeming religious fervour which does not seem to improve one's character but instead makes one look down condescendingly on those perceived as being different (the \\"Heathen\\", kin included, and even those of their own faith who sing or pray different from them), the importance of putting up a show for the public at all costs, hypocrisy, and greed. I could really relate to events and locations, seeing as I spent some time at Enugu (where Kambili's family lived) and Nsukka (where her aunt Ifeoma lived with her family). Adichie's vivid description of seemingly trivial things, like the feeling of dread and breathlessness Kambili feels when called upon for an opinion, add to the richness of the story.<br /><br />This is simply an outstanding novel, and I look forward  to more from Adichie's gifted pen.

B0006399FS|3.0|Their would-be comeback mixed the scope of their Eighties work with fragments of their Nineties experiments to breathtaking results; its would-be successor arrived courtesy of Steve Lillywhite, their original producer, and took them \\"back to basics.\\"  The songs themselves are linked by themes of love, peace, war, harmony, and death, themes which need the majestic grandiosity of U2 records like \\"[[ASIN:B000WS4PCO The Joshua Tree]]\\" to be fully expressed.  By returning to a raw--U2's version of raw, anyway--sound, similar to the basic grit-ishness of \\"[[ASIN:B000001FRY Boy]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000001FS1 October]],\\" they become more musically conservative, in the process ensuring songs that promise to catapult into \\"Beautiful Day\\"-esque highs barely even reach for those heights.  It's on the exceptions, like the guitar fireworks of \\"Miracle Drug\\" or the midnight sensationalist glimmer of \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" that the record soars.  There's some great material here, but the songs deserve better.  And let's not get in to Bono calling this their first \\"rock and roll\\" album.  Yeah, and the Stones are glam rock.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|In my opinion Vampires and Vampire mythology has run their course during the last 5 years. We have seem them displayed in every possible way in the forms of books, movies and the latest; TV series. With that said, \\"Let The Right One In\\" breathes new life into this genre a true, rare and sensitive movie, yet so real and mesmerising.<br /><br />Tomas Alfredson's carefully adapted thriller from the Swedish best-seller by John Ajvide Lindqvist is done with tender loving care which is why \\"Let the Right One In\\" is such a refreshing surprise: A bloodsucker story that's rich with originality and feeling, a terrific love story and vampire tome that not only rewards the genre's fans but rekindles interest in its virtually exhausted foundations.<br /><br />Kare Hedebrant plays Oskar, a transparent Swedish youth who is tormented and bullied daily at school. In comes Eli (Lina Leandersson) who moves in next door and they form a friendship that is so tender. Soon, Oskar and Eli develop a tenuous romance, even as she is forced to decide whether she will stay with him or retreat from view where she can continue feeding without attracting attention from the authorities.<br /><br />Unlike most of the vampire films that preceded it in recent years, Let the Right One In is truly a unique tale even though the protagonist is a 12-year-old boy obviously changes the dynamic of the story, but it's really the tender romance between him and Eli that gives the film its emotional resonance.

B000UR366S|1.0|I had heard that this album was Joni Mitchell playing all the instruments and singing... which I figured would be at least interesting--- after all, she used to be good.  But, it's not interesting, and she's not good any more.  Her song-writing skills have atrophied, and her voice is a husky shadow of what it once was.  Most of the lyrics sound like they were written by a wealthy woman with way too much time to spend winding herself up watching Fox and CNN news.  Irritating phony liberal whining of someone who can afford a nice house out on the California coast where she can fuss about the environment.  Hey Joni, your nice house destroyed habitat where nice animals and plants once lived, why don't you do a song about that?   I was glad I could check this out of my local library, and save my self the cost of purchasing it, since I wouldn't have kept it, or ever listened to it again.    Joni Mitchell would be well advised to release tapes of some of her early performances... there are good quality recordings of quite a few of her very good early songs (Urge For Going, Eastern Rain, etc...)  There was a time when she wrote memorable songs and sang them in her unique penetrating voice... those days are long gone.  When she lets those songs out, I'll buy then.    Even the opening track, a piano instrumental that I looked forward to hearing, was just kind of meandering.  And that was the high point of the album.    Anyway, a big disappointment, and don't spend your hard earned dollars here...  if you want to listen to a late 60s-early 70s singer song writer who still has it together and is better than ever, go check out Randy Newman's CD Harps and Angels...
B000IOM1YQ|4.0|After a series of albums that seemed to go softer and softer, The Alan Parsons Project plunged back into rock with their 9th album. \\"Stereotomy\\" broke tradition in several ways; an APP album that doesn't open with an instrumental, no Eric Woolfson solo vocal and the first APP album to be recorded digitally. The old DDD code on the CD made some of us squeamish with joy, as the early Parson's CD's were almost stereo soundtest quality, especially [[ASIN:B000JLQSW4 I Robot]] and [[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]]. Parsons even had a notorious lawsuit against Arista at the time, claiming that his CD's were outselling any other Arista catalog artist and therefore, he wanted his contract and royalties renegotiated along with more artistic freedom. (Google Parsons and \\"The \\"Sicilian Defence\\" for more.)<br /><br />It was into this new sonic world that \\"Stereotomy\\" was unleashed, and it was a pure sonic blast. The shear aggression of John Miles' voice on the title track was a harder rock that probably anything the APP had done before. The sound of 80's synths pulsed through the title track and \\"Beaujolais,\\" and the trademark instrumental sound of \\"Where is The Walrus\\" and \\"Urbania\\" just popped from the speakers. In short, \\"Stereotomy\\" was the most insistent APP album since [[ASIN:B000002VCU The Turn of a Friendly Card]].<br /><br />Sadly, the public had sort of moved on by now and \\"Stereotomy\\" met with a middling reception. It's too bad, because there are multiple excellent songs here, and a near-perfect ballad sung by [[ASIN:B000002G5E Procol Harum's]] Gary Brooker (\\"Limelight'). The original album and CD had a fun multi-color slip-sleeve that was fun to toy with (not on this version, sigh). The remaster is even better than the original CD, enhancing the lower-end considerably and sounding great on a surround system. It's been out of my collection for a few years, but \\"Stereotomy\\" is back, and better than ever.
0439023483|5.0|This book was recommended to me after I read Unwind by Neal Shusterman and although I didn't find it as powerful as Unwind, I still think it was an excellent book. The story had just the perfect combination of action, drama, and romance. It has a great message that you can stay human even in the most inhumane conditions. Needless to say, I am anxiously awaiting a sequel. I am sure even greater things are to come in the next book.

The sets and costumes are amazing, the acting superb. All in all another wonderful movie from Eastwood.
B000TGCR38|4.0|I'm not quite sure how I stumbled across this DVD but I sure am glad I spent this afternoon watching the 2 ½ hours of this film.  The story takes place in Holland nearing the end of World War II and the main character is a young Jewish woman, but Anne Frank this is not.  The film opens with a young woman teaching a class in an Israeli kibbutz as another woman who photographs her after exiting a tourist bus recognizes her.  Following a brief interlude, we move into flashback of over a decade earlier, 1944, and we are introduced to Rachel who lives in a farmhouse.  Immediately, we understand that Rachel is Jewish and she lives with a family that is protecting her from the Nazis.  Verhoeven creates in this film a realistic story that apparently is based on true events and since we saw Rachel in the 1956 opening scene, we know she survived WWII and emigrated from Holland to Israel.  This relieves any tension regarding her possible demise as we watch the next two hours of the film, spoiler unnecessary.<br /><br />The photography was beautiful, the acting superb, the story interesting, and it was rewarding to know that digital effects were kept at an absolute minimum in producing the film, \\"Black Book.\\"  Verhoeven's commentary was filled with interesting information regarding the filming as well as the history, past and more current, so I also recommend listening after viewing the film.  Details were exceptional and I was mesmerized by the makeup, although I did find it rather annoying to see van Houten always with beautiful makeup regardless of the fact that she endured some horrible experiences.  Her comfort in the naked scenes was exceptional and done very tastefully in each case.  I describe these as \\"naked\\" rather than \\"nude\\" because I really felt as though I was observing her and not watching from afar.  This film was part history, part war, part romance, part adventure, and a small part mystery.  All in all, watching this was a rewarding way to spend an afternoon.  It has given me much to think about regarding the humanity of people who demonstrate inhumane actions.  Think it's time now to see, \\"The Reader.\\"It has given me much to think about regarding the humanity of people who demonstrate inhumane actions.  Think it's time now to see, \\"The Reader.\\"
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|whoever said this album was classic should be shot. Every single song on this is a big yawn . when i was done sampling this album i was really bored. And the help in this comment is this. don't pay attention to what the critic say its what you think of the album. most people buy  bad albums because the critics said it was fantastic. And back in the seventies it was cool to do drugs. And everybody did it including the critics. So if someone says this album great don't belive it its what you think of it. the advice for the 5 star commenters. And for the 1 star commenters well your right about led zeppelin and some more advice always listen to an album never listen to other people theory. i hope this helped.

B001F0TM5I|5.0|Actual movie:    Death Proof seems hit or miss for some people. Most of the people who tell me that they don't like it complain that there's too much dialogue, but there are three reasons for this: 1. It makes the crash scene that much better of a payoff. 2. Tarantino meant this to be like a true grindhouse movie, and in those types of movies there was a lot of useless dialogue because they didn't have a big budget so much of the movie was dialogue to fill up running time to make it a feature length film. In this aspect, I felt he stayed very true to form but a lot of people wouldn't get this. 3. Even if there is a lot of dialogue, it's all really interesting dialogue. Kind of like the book Catcher in the Rye. It isn't really about anything but it's still a good read because the way it's written is so interesting.    Picture Quality:    Now when you hear about something like Death Proof on blu-ray, you might immediately think it's pointless because the whole point of the movie was to look \\"bad\\". The film was purposely meant to look like it was played too many times. Scratches everywhere, film spliced all over the place. I will still say the first half of the film benefits really well from the high def treatment. It looks kind of soft but the colors recieve a great boost. But where the movie truly shines is the second half with the second group of girls. I don't know if most people who have seen Death Proof bothered to notice how the film style changes drastically in the second half because they were so into the movie at the time, but it no longer has the \\"grindhouse\\" look after the movie switches to Lebanon, Tennessee. I will just say the second half of the movie on blu-ray makes the movie worth the purchase. It's gorgeous. Colors are splendid, and the images are razor sharp. I think the high point for me was a close up of Rosario Dawson in the car where she finally starts to smile while Zoey is tied to the hood of the car that just hits with a \\"BLEEM!\\" I can't describe it. It was just a  \\"BLEEM!\\" that resonated. The second half of this movie is like running naked through the rain. It's like drinking an ice cold beer while having a hot shower after a long, sh***y day at work. It's movies like this on blu-ray that will give you the hugest high def d*** alive and proudly boast about it.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a gripping film.  It has a great story, even though it is not plausible.  The camera work is so magnificent that even without the storytelling part, it would be a great documentary about India akin to \\"Baraka\\".  The acting is superb.  There have been many great reviews and enough said about its strengths.  The part I found puzzling that Jamal is arrested after the first day of the show and tortured all night.  Is there enough evidence to get him arrested?  The torture is even more severe than anything allowed at Guantanamo Bay - at least they do not use electric shocks there.  At one point, even the police officer in charge gets scared that Jamal is electrocuted.  I wonder if that is the standard practice in India and what Indian viewers would make of it.  Then, perhaps in only a few hours, Jamal seems to be in perfect form to continue the contest on television.  If I survived that kind if an ordeal, I would probably need at least a month to recover.  The mutilation of an orphan child scene is very disturbing.  Even during the darkest of times and among the most depraved of people, it is hard to even imagine a character as evil as the orphanage keeper who mutilates a child for monetary gain.  If that sort of thing really happened, I wonder how it would affect the keeper's karma.  Finally, the ending is lame.  Although completely fictional, the film's story is serious and the silly dance scene erodes it's emotional impact.  It was like telling viewers, \\"You got into it, didn't you?  But we were just kidding here.\\"  Still, this is a great film and it deserves 4 stars.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have watched Band of brothers on TV in HD, on normal DVD and now in Blu-ray and this version is by far the best. The additional features with the pop up in blu-ray work well and do add to the package. If you like war flicks and don't have this yet buy it. Is it worth buying again if you had the standard definition version - for me yes as it looks very nice in hd. Do note that the film was filmed with a grainy look - but is still looks good in hd.  recommended!

Even with the, dare I say, poor filming - it's storyline is pretty gripping - and some of the happening, unbelievable!  I've now got it on DVD - and I'll be watching the remake (which, we all know, won't be as good as the original). . .

B001HN6972|4.0|The Reader is one of those films that seem to attempt to examine an expansive range of moral and ethical values, with variable levels of success.  The story opens with the introduction of the middle-aged Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes), a professionally prosperous and successful barrister who also manages to convey an image of emotional detachment and personal vacuity. Through flashbacks, the viewer learns of his maturation process, beginning in his mid-teens when caught in the throes of age appropriate hormonal insurrection the onset of a bout of scarlet fever renders him incapacitated on the doorstep of public transport worker, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). Understandably smitten with the attractive but appreciably older woman, it is no surprise when he clumsily but enthusiastically acquiesces to her sexual advances.<br /><br /> As this segment processes, we learn a great deal more about Berg and the familial dynamics that have contributed to his development while Schmitz remains very much the enigma, compassionate but aloof, intensely private yet undeniably psychologically (and physiologically) needy.  She revels in being read to, with content or context seemingly irrelevant. Their relationship suffuses an aura of incongruent equality but rationality always forces the viewer to understand there is very little likelihood it could ever be sustainable and a deserved yet unacceptable promotion at work for Hanna proves to serve as the catalyst for the dissolution of her interactions with Michael, and she simply vanishes.<br /><br />Eight years later, Michael now a law school student participating in a seminar on ethics attends a war crimes trial and is shocked to discover his past infatuation on trial as part of group of women for crimes allegedly committed as concentration camp prison guards. He finds himself confronted by a spectrum of feelings, shocked to discover the secret for decades Hanna had shared with no one and also commensurately conflicted as he realizes out of recalcitrance she would rather wholly submit to the vagaries of legal system and the duplicity of her co-defendants than openly acknowledge her personal guilt and shame.<br /><br />Winslet clothed or not (but with the understanding as far as sexiness is concerned for this year's crop Marisa Tomei is in pole position), is mesmerizing as the complicated former prison guard as she is aged over a course of thirty years or more and is convincing at each epoch. She pulls off a German accent that seems completely unforced and tends to elicit empathy for a persona that very easily could have been construed as an abomination. David Kross as the youthful Michael Berg is nearly as impressive most especially throughout a group of sex scenes that I have to believe would turn most 18 year-olds the complexion of Hellboy. Fiennes is...well he's Ralph Fiennes which is not intended to infer a negative connotation but his typical thespian retentiveness is clearly on display here.<br /><br />The Reader is a very good film, one that highlights a multitude of moral/ethical questions, not necessarily new or revelatory, but questions that consistently reappear and are forever worthy of investigation.of recalcitrance she would rather wholly submit to the vagaries of legal system and the duplicity of her co-defendants than openly acknowledge her personal guilt and shame.<br /><br />Winslet clothed or not (but with the understanding as far as sexiness is concerned for this year's crop Marisa Tomei is in pole position), is mesmerizing as the complicated former prison guard as she is aged over a course of thirty years or more and is convincing at each epoch.

B001LF4IA6|4.0|As a 44 year old woman who has been a fan of Springsteen's music since the age of 14, I look forward to and am grateful for every new installment of music he produces and shares.  I know many fans are critical of this album and after a dozen or more listenings of Working on a Dream I don't understand the criticism.  There is some mellow and beautiful music and there are some songs that will absolutely rock when we hear them live, as is the case with much of his music.  Working... is not The River or Born to Run or The Rising but the music and the lyrics (with the exception of one or two of the titles)are rich and satisfying.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|Out of all of the performances by female actors with marquee names (so my personal favorite, Melissa Leo is immediately excluded), only in the case of Angelina Jolie did I ever manage to become so immersed in the film that I actually lost sight of the actor's celebrity status.  Winslet disrobes - often, Streep brings nothing new as the manchurian rendition devil wearing a habit and Hathaway has smeared mascara.  As the manipulated, distraught and aggrieved single mother, Christine Collins, Jolie embodies the essence of any parent's primary concern, in any era.<br /><br />Changeling is based on a true story of child abduction in \\"flapper\\" era Los Angeles with emphasis on the corruption within the police force and mayoral office that precluded any genuine effort to meet the actual needs of the constituency. Initially, Collins' pleas for responsiveness are ignored. Only after the authorities recognize an opportunity to use her in the effort to partially rehabilitate their public image does she find any level of assistance. When a child is identified that generally fit the description of her missing son, he is brought to L.A. and immediately, she realizes the child in front of her is not her biological son. In the prevailing environment the police, most noticeably the detective in charge of her case, Captain J.J. Jones, have no intention of allowing parental instinct - or forensic evidence - derail their haphazardly tracked locomotive to a potential partial restoration of public trust. She eventually finds an ally/advocate in the person of Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), an activist minister who had been on the campaign to clean up L.A.'s corrupt political and governmental entities.<br /><br />For me, Clint Eastwood's direction has been often hit or miss, I have a personal preference for films where he stays behind the camera instead of in front of it although I acknowledge Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby run contrary to that view.  Changeling is an impressive directorial effort, notwithstanding a meandering parallel courtrooms segment at the latter stages of the film that could just as well been edited out of the final version.rt, notwithstanding a meandering parallel courtrooms segment at the latter stages of the film that could just as well been edited out of the final version.
B001KX50BK|5.0|5/5 for the film, 3.5/5 video, 4/5 for the adudio.<br /><br />This film is one of my favorite films of all time, and I still cry everytime Vivian is on her way \\"home\\" and it sees Edward is leaving for good. Julia's breakout role is endearing and the chemistry is unmistakable between her and Richard.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray was watched on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD35K. Although the Blu-Ray does not provide a drastic upgrade, the colors and clarity in this BD version, are still noticable. I decided to rent it first, as I was afraid that the upgrade would be disappointing. I'd say it's worth a $15 purchase, for sure. There is some noticable grain throught the film, while the colors pop and outdoor scenes are quite beautiful.<br /><br />Still one of my favorites, and it always will be. Congratulations to Disney for bringing this older title to BD!
B00080Z53O|5.0|I teach Spanish 3 & 4 and use this movie every year.  Although it's a controversial topic, the students really enjoy discussing the theme and seeing the movie.  Some students have said this is one of the best films they have ever seen.  It really gets kids talking and thinking of what \\"quality of life\\" really means and who has the right to decide.    Although it's all in Spanish, I keep on the English subtitles to help students understand the Castillian accent, which they're not used to hearing that often.  The subtitles don't diminish the power of this film.  Buy it today!
B001FB55YE|3.0|Let me say that I liked Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and loved Snatch.  However, this movie leaned more into a light action/very light comedy mode.  It had a very slow pace, I don't really recall any real laughs or tense moments.  Just a director telling us all a story.<br /><br />The picture and audio was fine, not that it mattered.<br /><br />However, I think I was expecting more of a dark comedy.  There was no Turkish, no Bullet-tooth Tony, just some people screwing each other.<br /><br />I didn't give it a low score, because it wasn't bad, it's just I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters.<br /><br />My suggestion is to definitely rent it first.  If you like the genre, I'd suggest the two aforementioned movies or maybe Layer Cake.
B000002ADT|5.0|With the 50th anniversary of \\"Kind Of Blue\\", a whole new generation is being exposed to some of the best Jazz ever! Few could make the trumpet talk like Miles, and NOBODY sounds more unmistakeable than him! His sound, then, and now, is \\"Miles\\" apart!!! I can't imagine what he'd be playing now!  This album is a MUST HAVE for any serious student of music, and especially Jazz. Any serious student of Miles' or Jazz horns already has it.    If you just like Jazz? It's perfect for you too. Soothing and free, listen to Miles and crew shine on this one.
B0007KVM32|5.0|After finding out Amazon is set up to handle only the American alphabet hard way, I was kinda reluctant to rework.  Then slowly realized a review with those bug holes which are supposed to hold Russian words written with the Cyrillic alphabet wont offer much help to the readers.  Also, the fact I'm from an ethnic group that's famous or notorious, depending on which way you look at it, for being perfectionistic bugged me, no pan intended here.  So, here you're, my revised review without St. Cyrill on « Here supposed to hold the Cyrillic word for The Sunflowers » or « I Girasoli ».    This is a personal account on the DVD-film « PODSOLNUKHI / I Girasoli » I purchased from marinasbooks thru Amazon Marketplace.  The DVD is exactly what Marina describes in her Webshop.    The disc was pressed in Moskva, Rossiyskaya Federatsiya by Film Prestige in 2004.  Packaging is classy digipak.  What's written on the back of the slipcase is, unfortunately, all Greek to me - it's in Russian using the Russian Cyrillic alphabet, to be exact.  The original film was released in 1970 when only thing we knew about digit was fingers.  Fingers turned into computer digit over time and FP took a full advantage of it.  It's clear that they used a quite sophisticated digitizing program to resurrect this oeuvre by Vittorio de Sica, one of « il neorealismo italiano » film directors, because of its crisp picture and good sound.  Some folks might object saying that the color is a tad on the washed-out side.  To me, it's an acceptable trade-off to have details in the shadow area.  I personally prefer the exquisite pastel tone.    I run into a couple of reviews on the film by others who say that the film is a « Soviet propaganda nonsense » citing that after the WWII every single foreigner was deemed to be a spy and therefore condemned.  Even if survived, he would have subsequently perished in a gulag, much less moving about freely in the Soviet Union like Giovanna (Sophia Loren) did.  The film isn't, therefore, a true-to-life rendition.  The authors must have been confused with the term « neoREALismo ».  The oeuvre isn't a documentary film.  According to me, it's rather an anti-war melodrama with a flair of comedy.    You might recall high school history class.  If you forgot as I did, here's a highly simplified TLC:  in the WWII the Soviet Union fought two fronts - Great Patriotic War / Eastern Front against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in central and eastern Europe and Imperial Japan in the Far East.  The Great Patriotic War is said to be the largest theater in history and is notorious for its unexampled ferocity, destruction, and tremendous loss of life.  With estimated over 30 million killed, it's almost a total annihilation.  More people fought and died in the Great Patriotic War than in all other theaters of WWII combined.    That said, the film is a saga of a newly wed bride whose husband fails to return from Fronte-Russo (June 1941 - June 1943) who volunteered to join Il Corpo di Spedizione Italino in Russia to avoid court-martial for faking to be mentally insane to evade a call-up.  The core of the story begins when an old man walks by Giovanna's house calling out:  « È finito la guerra ! ».  Giovanna:  «Quale è finito ? ».  The old man:  « La guerra ! ».  Giovanna finds herself among the mothers, wives and girlfriends of soldiers with a picture asking retuned soldiers at the railway station:  « Conosce / Conoscete ? ».  The soldier who tried to help Anton (so Giovanna called Antonio (Marcello Mastroianni)) on the Don while the Italian soldiers were put to rout as war ended recognized the picture Giovanna was holding.  Even after learning what happened to Anton, she's reluctant to accept a possible fate her husband might have met, saying: « È vivo ».  She travels to the Soviet Union and SSSR MINISTERSTVO VNESHNEJJ TORGOVLI (Department of Foreign Trade) provides an interpreter.  At one point, they come to a huge expanse of sunflower field, hence the name of the film.  Those sunflowers yawing in breeze, forces beyond their control, look like the dead begging to bring them back to life.  There's a monument dedicated to the war dead.  Giovanna is told by a local woman that the Germans forced Italian soldiers to dug a mass grave and the grave underneath those sunflowers contains a large number of remains of Italian, Russian and German soldiers, and local farming folks; the aged, women, and even children.  Not deterred, her quest for finding her husband somewhere in Russia continues.  Eventually she comes to the hills covered with crosses made out of birch twigs.  The epitaph chiseled into the stone of the small monument there is adapted from the poem « ITAL'JANECH » (italiano) by Mihail A. Svetlov (1903.06.17, Dnipropetrovs'k, Ukraïna - 1964.09.28, Moskva).  The second paragraph of the poem starts:  « Giovani figli di Napoli !  Che cosa ti ha porto sui campi di Russia ? ... ».  The poem by Svetlov cries out for a dream of peace and spirit of friendship.  By this time the interpreter has grown tired and started to dissuade Giovanna from continuing her search.  Giovanna, in response, declares:  « Io sono sicura che il mio marito non c'è là.  Antonio è vivo ! ».  Her search continues and, to make a long story short, Giovanna was finally pointed to a house in a village where they say an italian lives.  Half-frozen Anton lay dying on the snow covered battle field was saved by Mascia ((Ludmila Savelyeva) - 1942.01.24 - , Sankt-Peterburg, Rossiyskaya Federatsiya)).  After the war if a lady wanted to make a home of her own she had to resort to even a half-dead foreign solder.  As you might notice in the film you don't see that many men.  So many people as noted above in the 5th paragraph were killed, young men as soldiers in particular.  Anton and Mascia have married and they have a little daughter called Katjusha.  When Giovanna showed up in front of Mascia's house while Anton was away at work, she understood what can potentially come about.  Both women are obviously upset but they both collect themselves and succeed in hiding their emotion.  Whistles from an engine sound.  It's time for Mascia to go to the railway station to see Anton.  Giovanna follows her.  At first sight after a long absence of her husband, who re-married to a Russian woman, on the platform, Giovanna's emotion explodes into tears.  Unbearable, she jumps onto the moving train, which brought Anton back home from work, to go back to Italy, shattered.  In the mean time, Anton plans to go to Italy to see Giovanna again.  When he finally made it to Milano, he places a call to Giovanna to arrange a rendez-vous chez elle.  Understandably, however, she refuses.  As fate has it, however, on that day the railway workers went on strike.  He couldn't go back to Wien where he can take a train back to Soviet Union.  He calls Giovanna for the second time.  On the night of una tempesta, Anton visits Giovanna in her apartment where he finds that she too is now married with a son.  Anton:  « Come chiama ? ».  Giovanna:  « Antonio ».  Elated, he asks her again:  « Come me ? ».  She responds:  « Non, Anton di San Antonio ».  The message is clear.  Anton takes a train home in Russia, down-hearted.  Giovanna, showing her maturity, comes to the Milano Termini to bid adieu - note the word has a sense of finality and the next time they see each other is with God.  The doors of the cars are all closed now and the train pulls slowly out of the station.  A misty image of the train carrying Anton on back to Russia reflected in Giovanna's eyes gets smaller and smaller.    The scenes where Giovanna encounters Anton on the Russia railway platform and the ones where Giovanna sees Anton off on the train in Milano are simply tear jerkers.    If you understand Russian, ignore this paragraph.  The first thing you see when you start the DVD is an undecipherable, at least for me, lines.  Don't fret !  Nothing has gone wrong with you screen.  It only means « avvertimento », a standard deal these days.  Even Scandinavian DVDs display it.  Then the company logo « Film Prestige » appears.  The screen you'll see next contains six lines.  The first line is the title of the film in cursive Russian.  The second is « I Girasoli ».  Jump down to the second line from the bottom.  That's for settings.  Then the screen will be refreshed with a new one with eight lines.  Skip dow to the forth line from the very top.  It means « Italian ».  Click on it.  Go dow again three lines, or the second from the very last, to set subtitle off.  Press on it.  Now the film starts and your cinematic gratification should be on the rail.  Enjoy !
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Reading Peter Rabbit and company to children is one of life's simple pleasures, as was watching Chris Noonan's treatment of the middle years of author Beatrix Potter's life. Not content to become the wife of a \\"suitable\\" man to fulfill the expectations of Edwardian society, Miss Potter remained single until well into her forties. Truly a woman ahead of her time, she filled her rather solitary life with meaningful literary, artistic, and scientific pursuits, leaving a legacy that will endure long into the future. Beatrix Potter's remarkable spirit and character are well represented in this film, portrayed with admirable restraint by Rene Zellweger.  The supporting cast was equally well chosen and talented. Part love story and part biography, this film captures time and place via stunning cinematography. Intelligent and quietly eloquent, it is a portrait of a life well and genuinely lived.
B001C48EGK|4.0|I was not able to see the film in the theater.    I had read the reviews.  So, I was NOT sure what to expect.    ONE THING I HAVE HATED ABOUT THE MARKETING OF THE FILM.  CREDIT FOR ACTORS....I'm sorry but should NOT the Oscar winner get top billing over the Oscar nominee?  Leo got top billing over Russell just because of \\"The Nudie Boat Movie\\"?    This was a big mistake.    The film is good.  Not great.  Russell did his usual good job with his role.  Once again playing a character older & larger (he had to put on weight again like he did in \\"The Insider\\").    All Leo does is be angry, yell & curse.        I did expect more with this 2 disc DVD package.  Commentary from Ridley & a couple of writers.  NO actor commentary.  Russell should have been there, remember he & Ridley have now worked together 4 times.  Just no real special extras on this except for the digital copy disc.  Only good to input for a year after DVD release.    Then, another credit problem.  When you read the back the DVD they credit Ridley with \\"American Gangster\\" & \\"Black Hawk Down\\".  How about \\"Blade Runner\\", a little Best Picture & Actor winner \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Alien\\" etc.    No chapter list sheet inside.    A good film I want to say again.

B00003CXTG|1.0|Another reviewer has written, \\"The movie does have profanity in it,including God's name in vain, so parents be warned ahead of time before you decide to let your children watch it.\\" Is viewing and hearing profanity, sex, violence, etc. any less harmful to parents than it is to their children?     As a Christian, this is why I can no longer watch the great majority of contemporary films.
B00129H7VS|4.0|I have the DVD set of this series and decided it was a worthwhile upgrade to Blu Ray. There is noticeable film grain on many of the sequences, but this is intentional in order to mimic WW2 style footage (especially in a lot of the handheld camera action shots), and I don't believe it detracts from the viewing experience, but rather adds a level of authenticity you wouldn't otherwise get if the picture quality was 100% pristine like you would see in a modern-day Hollywood movie.    For most people, I think the DVD set would suffice, but for big fans of the series, or people who have larger HDTVs or a front projector home theatre setup, then the Blu Ray version is a worthwhile upgrade.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|A friend told me that he despised this film, found it slow and plodding and melodramatic; so I went into it cautiously. Not necessarily with no expectations, just knowing that it might be one I'd switch off after 1/2 an hour.  Well, I don't know if my friend and I saw the same film, but I was completely sucked into this.  I found the performances excellent (and I'm not particularly a fan of Jolie, but she is excellent) and the setting of time an place without fault.  Many times in period pieces, you get a presentation of style over storytelling, stilted dialog more fitting of noir than realism.  Here, the style and the era are blended in perfectly.  At about 2 hours and 15 minutes, this movie just flew by for me and each and every performance was near pitch perfect.<br /><br />A fascinating movie, well acted and well directed.  Give it a shot.

0312427646|4.0|[[ASIN:0312427646 The Uncommon Reader: A Novella]] by Alan Bennett is a witty look at how the Queen of England's love of reading impinges on her duties and helps her evolve as a human being. There is a great deal to love about this small volume.<br /><br />At first, the Queen of England isn't sure what to make of the traveling library that she runs across at the palace. Once she begins reading, she can't stop and takes it upon herself to appoint a kitchen boy as her amanuensis, a writing assistant to conduct research and perform secretarial duties, named Norman. He helps her select books from the traveling library and from the London Library.<br /><br />\\"[Norman] came back full of wonder and excitement at how old-fashioned it was, saying it was the sort of library he had only read about in books and had thought confined to the past. He wandered through its labyrinthine stacks marvelling that these were all books that he (or rather She) could borrow at will. So infectious was his enthusiasm that next time, the Queen thought, she might accompany him.\\" (page 19)<br /><br />She becomes so engrossed in her reading that she begins carrying books with her in the carriages and to official functions and begins to look upon her normal daily activities, like being briefed on the events of the government and world, as the \\"antithesis of reading\\" (page 21). Her speeches before Parliament became tedious and \\"demeaned the very act of reading itself\\" (page 33).<br /><br />It's interesting to watch how certain members of the staff react to her reading habit and how they conspire to eliminate it. Despite all of the government's machinations, however, the Queen perseveres. Readers will adore the end of the novel and how it turns the rest of it upside down.

B001EN71DG|1.0|Alright, I am a die hard Star Wars fan, and I have stood up for George Lucas countless times, but even I have my limit.  I bought the original trilogy at midnight the day it came out on DVD, and watched all three movies that I love as soon as I got home.  But even though I love the entire saga, I still haven't bought the prequels, because I know that at some point, a huge set will be released that contains the 6 movies, the animated movies, and maybe even the Ewok movie, along with all the discs of supplemental material that I know they have the material for.  Yet, here is another RErelease of the trilogies, (separate of course.)  We have all been so faithful to this series from the beginning, and you know they realize that a complete SAGA collection is what we want, but they refuse to even talk about or mention it.  How many dips are they gonna take into this before people realize that as long as we buy the movies separately, they are never going to give us what we the fans want and deserve.
0307269752|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I am a VERY busy person,teacher and mom of 2 and 4 yr olds,  but then again who isn't. I have a hard time finding time to read novels, for fun.  If I read a novel it better be good, I only watch about one movie per year, and it better be good too.  Once I got into this book, I found myself purchasing a book light so that I could stay up until 1 - 2am reading.  I really enjoyed the suspense and mystery, and weirdness of these characters.  There were two parts that I had wished I hadn't started the book but got through it, when all said and done I'm glad I had the opportunity to enjoy it.  I have read other reviews, I'd hope that this would be unrealistic that's why it's fiction. I am really glad that I found a book like this, I hope that I can again soon, maybe the sequel, but not until spring break.
0440241413|5.0|As demonstrated by my rating, I adored this book. I was on a plane home from Iraq, wanted some tasty brain candy, and that is exactly what I got. The hours flew by as I laughed, gasped, and thought to myself, \\"Wow, this girl is a hot mess; what is she going to do next?\\"<br /><br />On a deeper note, I have read several reviews in which people rant about how despicably horrid Becky is and what they would do if they met someone like her in real life. I think we should keep some perspective. Becky is a FICTIONAL character, and, as such, she is an over-the-top caricature of a real life consumerism addict. While journeying through her mind, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the massive quantities of lavish excess, but if people are truly honest with themselves, they will see that there is a lot of Becky in many people throughout our society. Becky has good intentions, and there is never any malice in her erratic actions. She is simply the quintessence of poor impulse control; she can never see beyond the moment and her fantasies of who she can be if she has that Denny and George scarf/Vera Wang dress/Angel bag RIGHT NOW. Think about it; who among us doesn't know someone who has a Harley Davidson that they never ride? Who bought a brand new GM Hummer that costs nearly half their paycheck instead of a certified secondhand Mitsubishi Montero? Who pays the minimum monthly payment with super high interest on the $3000 surround sound system instead of saving for it? Who has a dress that they have never fit into because it was such a great sale? Many of us have done this after somehow convincing ourselves that these things were \\"necessities.\\" And we didn't think too hard about whether we were staying within our means; we were thinking \\"OMG, everyone will call me the girl/guy with the [insert your luxury item here].\\"<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want a fluffy, delightful morsel of enjoyment, read this book. When you are done, take a few minutes to see what you can learn from Becky's mistakes (I know I did). Confessions of s Shopaholic satisfies on many levels.(I know I did). Confessions of s Shopaholic satisfies on many levels.
B00005OCMR|2.0|This film was considered really out there and revolutionary when it was released, and while the film has a great central concept, its execution is boring, stilted, clumsy, and disappointing.  It wasn't a particularly good film back in 1982, and it's even worse today.  The computer effects, while still interesting, seem antiquated and really are only for nostalgic people who miss Atari and Colecovision.  The lead characters (except for Jeff Bridges, who is so good all he has to do is show up, and David Warner, an excellent British character actor) are boring, and the actors who play them (Bruce Boxleitner and Cindy Morgan) are tepid.  Boxleitner, who plays Tron and Tron's \\"user\\", is especially limited, dull as paste.  Many people think that Bridges played Tron, but he doesn't (he should have).  Morgan is cute, but she's just cheesecake here (the only other film I remember her in was in Caddyshack).  While the film was mounted handsomely (shot in 70mm), it's a simplistic film, with bad, wooden dialogue and choppy pacing.  The score by the great Wendy Carlos is excellent though, and is available on CD.<br /><br />Tron reminds me of The Black Hole, which came out a few years earlier and was a pretty ambitious movie for Disney.  It also had (for the time) great special effects (which still look good), but had a lousy, simplistic story that undermined the film.  The Black Hole had better performances and was the better of the two films.<br /><br />If you have an inkling for 80's nostalgia and video games, rewatch this film.  Otherwise, it's a really dated film that will probably produce chuckles and boredom rather than a sense of awe.
B001EO748M|4.0|Very good series to watch, especially if one enjoys the  history of England and it's Kings/Queens.  Looking forward   to season 3.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Not much to say, music is pretty personal... but this CD/DVD set is AWESOME. I'm not usually to into Music DVDs unless they're documentaries and it helps if they have a blues player.  This DVD though is worth it, the mastering is very artistic and the sound quality it phenomenal for a live recording. There is a lot more than nostalgia here. Neil released a lot of love into the world not just music, I just want to say thanks for both!
0743270754|4.0|Very easy to read and good book for those who are visual readers. I will going forward view Lincoln and his rivals in a more thoughtful and educated way.  Good read.
0743270754|5.0|Most readers would question the need for another Lincoln Biography at this point. After 200 years and numerous Biographies, is there anything new to learn about the man? In Team of Rivals, Doris Kearns Goodwin answers that question with a resounding yes. Her focus is mainly on Lincoln as political operator. She explores this theme by looking at Lincoln through the eyes of his three greatest political rivals(and later cabinet members) William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates. Goodwin begins her narrative at the 1860 Republican convention where all 4 were vying for the nomination. Lincoln was thought to be a long shot, but thanks to some adroit maneuvering on the part of his management team, he managed to position himself as every delegation's second choice, and to secure the nomination as a compromise candidate. The rest of the book focuses on the way in which Lincoln managed the Civil War, and the way in which various cabinet members influenced policy, and helped shape his evolving view of slavery. Lincoln was also a master at massaging his team's ego's when political in-fighting threatened to break the cabinet apart. He also had an incredible capacity for forgiveness. For example, when Chase crossed him one too many times, he finally accepts his resignation as head of the treasury, only to later appoint him Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Can you imagine a President giving a major rival a post with a lifetime appointment today?!<br /><br />I was captivated by the portrait of William Seward, sadly he is remembered today only for his purchase of Alaska, much derided at the time as \\"Seward's Folly\\" I had no idea he was one of the leading political figures of his generation.<br /><br />A complex portrait of Lincoln emerges from Team of Rivals, one that forever shatters the myth that he was a blundering backwoods political neophyte who could be easily influenced.
0143034901|4.0|And therein lies the beauty. Don't pick this up expecting anything but a brooding city, flawed and tragic love affairs, passionate physical encounters inside a hanuted mansion during a thunderstorm, a bookshop, a dark character who hides his burned face, lots of rain . . . it's all there. And Zafon pulls it off beautifully. Fermin is a real treat. Without his witty, energetic and passionate character, perhaps the book would not have been so sharp. But he shines, and carries the book for the most part.<br /><br />My only complaint was the way Zafon failed to carry some of the early threats. The burned man was one. After appearing early in the story with real, gripping and very possible threat, he virtually vanished, not to be seen for many many many pages.<br /><br />But for the most part, a highly enjoyable read. Not quite on a par with O'Neill's 'The Lamplighter,' but has that same brooding tone.<br /><br />Delightful!

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon has done it again, taking his gifts for tuneful tragedy to the next level in terms of creativity, production, and distribution.  The 2008 writer's strike may have been an impediment to the production of humdrum television series and second-rate movies, but it spurred Whedon and his collaborators to write, produce, and distribute this gem of a musical.  Don't miss the special features, especially the video applications for entry into the Evil League of Evil, which show that there is a new generation of talent ready to fill Joss's shoes, and of course, Commentary: the Musical.  \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" proves that Whedon's knack for penning hummable songs and black humor can exist outside the context of BTVS, where the success of \\"Once More With Feeling\\" relied in part on an understanding of long-established characters and story lines.  Don't know Whedon, or Buffy, or Angel, or Firefly?  You'll still love Dr. Horrible, if you have an ear for music, and an ounce of human feeling.
B001AKJ97O|3.0|In a day and age where all the British music artists sound like Amy whinehouse, Adele seems to break the mold and try something new. I heard alot about her on the grammy's so I was def. up for listening to her CD. I was pleasently surprised at how much i recognized some of her stuff. She's a great music artist, and she really tries to be true to the singer song writer feel. Chasing Pavements is really my favorite song on the album. I really liked the first couple of tracks compared to the last. She's really going to be around for a while and very respected. She's a good mix between Amy Winhouse and Sarah McLocklan.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Ive always loved the mad max movies and the special edition one is a great movie has extras and everything!!
B00123JRDK|2.0|I'm not a really a big fan of this album. Well, it just plain sucks. It's really bad 80's pop and it sounds outdated. And I love 80's music! I mean her other 80's stuff is a lot better then this crap. I was expecting her duet with Prince to be off the chain(boy was i wrong). It would be great to see them do an uptempo song together. Other then that Express yourself(well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid). Like a Prayer is ok, the video and concept are great. But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much, even today. (its like mj with thriller,it gets old quick!)It's really not that great of a song. The only one that I really like is act of contrition. It's got sort of a rhythm nation feel to it. It's very good and creative. Other then that I would not waste two cents on this CD.

031606792X|2.0|The only reason I finished this book is because I needed some closure, having just read the first three novels in the past month (and I kept hoping it would get better). Sure, none of them have any real literary merit, but they were engaging, creative, and reminded me of the pining of adolescence.     The first half of this book was painful to read. It was boring and preachy. Thanks for throwing in your \\"sex should be saved till marriage\\" lesson, Stephenie, as well as a little anti-abortion message. It goes from tedious to preachy to more and more unbelievable. Bella is the most perfect, special person on earth.     This book appeals to (especially teenage) women because it's what all women want: good looks; youth; unlimited clothes and money; supportive and loving family and friends; and a devoted partner who is handsome, intelligent, polite, considerate, selfless, wealthy, funny, and is willing to abstain from sex until the woman is ready (and then of course is amazing in bed).

0143038419|4.0|This book is great. It's a quick read. I really loved Italy (eat) and Indonesia (love). India (pray)I could have done without. I skipped some pages there, the writer tends to get stuck on an idea or a revelation or whatever in that section that is kind of boring. But Italy and Indonesia are lovely and colorful and warm. I would recommend this book to any of my girlfriends.

1568814518|5.0|This book is a great primer on the principles of the most gorgeously abstract discipline in origami -- tessellations, repeated patterns in paperfolding that result in a flat planar surface.  The pictures are wonderful and illustrate many of the basic ideas, and the directions are clear and will give anyone the grounding they need to branch off on their own and design new tessellations based on the building blocks this volume teaches.  The instructions are also clear, and Gjerde is careful to warn the newbie about any pitfalls particular to a diagram.    I can recommend this book to anyone -- but just make sure to purchase some mulberry paper before you open the book, because your fingers will start to itch the minute you finish it!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm only on day two of using the video but, zow, woke up this morning and I could seriously feel the effects of yesterday's workout on just level 1.  But pushed through and did it again anyhow (and am glad I did!)  This is exactly what I was looking for ... I recently lost 18 lbs with Weight Watchers, and now that I'm back in my healthy weight range (but 10 or so more lbs to lose to get to my ideal weight) wanted to take it up a notch.   Another great motivator: I have another 6 weeks to go until a trip to Maui and am hoping to look toned in a bathing suit (about the only thing that could motivate me to get up and do this @ 6am!).  My goal in buying this DVD was to have a way to help me get strength training in / add tone and definition WITHOUT having to go to the gym early mornings or doing weights after work (I'm a single mom; I can handle a half hour on the elliptical post-work/pre-picking my daughter up from preschool but not a lot more since I have to get us home, make dinner, etc.  Our schedule is crazy tight)  This totally does it.  Very easy to squeeze in before my daughter wakes up and before hopping in the shower in the morning.    What I like is that she keeps changing it out ... just when you think you can't do another jumping jack, you switch to butt kicks (different muscle group so, even though it's more cardio, you can keep going), just when you think you can't do another lunge, you switch to chest muscle work.  I am just as sweaty and tired after 20 mins of this as I am after a hard 6mph 30 mins on the elliptical, that's for sure.  Maybe it's just that I'm 42, but I don't think so.  I'm not in bad shape; I routinely walk 6-10 miles w/o even thinking about it, but this is pretty intense, even just on level one.  I'll be interested to see what, if any, difference this makes over 6  weeks, combined with me continuing my 1200 or so calorie diet and 3-5 days a week of cardio work.    A caveat: there's no mention anywhere that you need handweights for theworkout, so get some.  There's also no mention of what size you should use (which I think is just irresponsible; what were they thinking?).   For those just starting out 2 or 3 lb weights will do it.  I switch out between 3 and 5 lbs -- lighter for the smaller muscle groups, heavier for the larger.

B000068QKT|5.0|This delightful French confection, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and co-written by Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant, is the story of Am&eacute;lie Poulain, the product of a hilariously dysfunctional marriage.  Her father is an obsessive-compulsive doctor and her mother is a nervous and twitchy schoolteacher.  As a result, Am&eacute;lie grows up isolated from her peers, and has a strong tendency to fantasize.  When she finally leaves home, she takes a job as a waitress and settles in Montmarte, in northern Paris.  There, she meets a host of eccentric characters whose lives become intertwined with hers in fascinating ways.<br /><br />This film is original, irresistibly charming, beautifully photographed, and laugh-out-loud funny.  Jeunet's cast is marvelous, and Audrey Tautou is perfect in the title role.  Her waif-like, large-eyed stare takes in everything and everyone around her, but she always remains on the fringes of life.  One evening, she finds a buried treasure that a little boy hid in her apartment forty years earlier.  She suddenly makes a life-altering decision to help others anonymously.  Am&eacute;lie subsequently gets involved with an aged shut-in, a mean-spirited greengrocer, a lonely woman abandoned by her philandering husband, and a young man with an extremely strange hobby.  She even tries her hand at bringing together an uproariously quirky couple.<br /><br />Jeunet fills the screen with unexpected sight-gags that, along with the droll dialogue, amuse us as we shake our heads, wondering how the screenwriters came up with this unusual story.  Yet for all its eccentricity, \\"Am&eacute;lie\\" explores universal and timeless themes. The lonely and the misunderstood among us need and deserve our compassion; without love, a human being withers away; and in our harsh, dog-eat-dog world \\"times are hard for dreamers.\\"
B0018CVQFM|3.0|I've always been a huge Graham Nash fan starting back with the Hollies and continuing through the various incarnations of CSN&Y and his solo career. This box set is an interesting compilation of all phases of his career, offers previously unreleased songs as well as new remixes. If you have no Graham Nash in your CD collection it might make sense as a comprehensive purchase. For long time fans I just don't see enough new here to justify its purchase. Better to go the route of downloading some of the excellent rarities contained here to supplement your other CD's.    Here are some of my reasons. First of all there is way too little Hollies material to truly be called comprehensive. The problem is the Hollies was more of a democracy and many of Graham's great contributions are in collaboration with Allan Clarke and Tony Hicks. That said, some great songs that Nash wrote and performed mostly solo with the Hollies are not included. Some examples; Tell Me To My Face, Wings, Clown, Butterfly, Everything is Sunshine. So rather than some great and in some cases rare Hollies material, you get mediocre at best later day CSNY.    Obviously, any big fan of Nash's already has the great CSNY material, Songs for Beginners and the first 2 Crosby-Nash releases. These would truly contain the best Nash post-Hollies material. Like I said, you can supplement this material with a few downloads from Relections including Lonely Man, Water from the Moon, Try to Find Me, In Your Name, etc.    I honestly believe if you own the previously issued CS&N box set from many years ago, you really won't need this Nash boxset nor most likely any Crosby or Stills boxset. Many times these boxsets are not so much essential as they are an interesting snaphot of an artist. In that respect this boxset succeeds. If this was the only Graham Nash CD you'd own, I think you'd be happy. If like myself you own many Nash related CD's I don't think there is enough new here to justify the price.
0316017922|2.0|I found this book to be organized in a disorganized way--a lot of \\"loose ends\\" tied together too loosely for me. The author made a good point using opportunity, environment, practice, and time frame to describe who the outliers are, but a point that got lost in the number and types of examples Gladwell brought into his book. I could recommend this read, but be forewarned: It's not an \\"A\\" essay.

B0007MWZEK|3.0|I purchased this sweeper about 6 months ago - I believe it is the older model.  It worked great - I thought it was the best thing I'd ever purchased - it is great for going into small areas I can't get a normal vacuum, and I don't have to bother with cords.  I have a small 2 bedroom house with all hardwood floors and tile, so it was pretty much all I needed to sweep up the floors each week.  I liked it so well I even bought one for my parents for Christmas.  You do have to be careful to pick up any string or power cords, or drape cords because it will pick them up and they will get lodged in there easily.    However, 2 weeks ago, the product stopped running after only partially finishing the house - before that I could clean my house at least once on a battery charge.  I did leave the battery charging a little too long one time and I thought that was the problem.  I ordered a brand new battery - thinking with a spare I'd have plenty of power to finish the house, even if I'd shortened the life of the first battery.  I charged the new battery. I started with the old, and that ran about 7 minutes and the sweeper stopped, and I put the new charged battery in. It ran for a couple minutes and quit.  I emptied it and cleaned out hair from the bottom and could run it again for 30 seconds and it would stop again. The bottom felt hot.  It's not under warranty anymore so I decided since it was not working to take it apart and see if there was any way I could clean it better. It was pretty easy - there are several screws on the bottom that are visible, and 4 more that are under the 4 white plastic balls on the bottom. I carefully (keeping track of the order of the parts and how they went together) took apart the brushes and gears and cleaned out hair and a thread that was stuck in the gears and reassembled it so things moved freely.  It appears to work just like new on the same battery charge that was running out 30 minutes earlier.  It even did the carpets in my house that I had not tried for awhile.  My guess is that it was overheating because the hair and thread were stuck in the gears and making the machine have to work hard to turn the gears and causing it to overheat before the battery was dead.  I will know next time when I use it to clean the whole house if I have fixed it - that it was not just a case of allowing it time to cool down.  It was a fairly simple to do what I did - not hard to disassemble and reassemble if you paid attention to where the parts go. I would not try this if the warranty was still valid, but I figured I had nothing to lose. I did take the battery out first to be safe. If for some reason I still have trouble next time and it ends up just being a bad part, I will post a comment - but I mainly wanted to say that you may think the battery may be your problem if it stops but it may not be.  Let it cool down for a half hour and try it again on the same battery and see if it runs for while and that will tell you if the battery may be bad. I figure it is one of two things - the hair etc. was making it work extra hard and overheat (that is what I suspect) - or just stopping it from turning, or a just a bad part in there that is overheating - we will see.  I did not do a good job of cleaning it out regularly and I will now.  I thought this info might be helpful to someone. It's worth a try before throwing it away or spending alot to fix or replace parts.

B001DHXT20|5.0|Great movie, and certainly way better than the 2003 film \\"The Hulk\\".     In the 2003 film \\"The Hulk\\", you really saw the computer input in the movie graphics and you could tell it was fake. In \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", it all looked real.     I even was happy to hear the soundtrack of the old Hulk series. I was also happy to see them give tribute to Lou Ferrigno, the true incredible hulk.     What was new about this movie is seeing a villain with very similar powers to the incredible hulk, instead of the classical Hulk vs the army where he kicks their butts throughout the movie. This time we see a real match to the powerful hulk.     Definetely a great improvement in the Hulk prequal, and I salute the casting team for choosing Edward Norton to play the hulk role.

B00000I8UD|5.0|this album was necessary to release because it presents a maturing process started by gone to earth & secrets of the beehive.   this album may have been a holding pattern for those albums, but what a holding pattern it was!   for example \\"the shining of things\\" may cause one to think of \\"waterfront\\" but the context & subject matter is different.   plus on this song one can hear (especially on headphones) some deep voice or voices in between the strings.   \\"godman\\" & \\"pollen path\\" may sound like songs that did not make it to the first day final cut, but they contain certain elements that were not featured on that album.   with dead bees on a cake one gets all aspects of sylvian at that time: ethereal, noisy, polished, lengthy (i surrender) followed by short(dobro),subtle sampling, world music mix, rain tree crow-like instrumental, & one of his best pieces saved for last \\"darkest dreaming\\". at times i am tempted to say that this is his best album and i am writing this review AFTER listening to blemish and nine horses' snow bourne sorrow.   along with steve roach & brian eno, david sylvian is one of my favorite recording artists.

B00005JKC3|3.0|Once the action kicks in, this is entertaining story and the Blu-Ray transfer here is one of the best I've seen: very, very sharp. That alone made me elevate the rating.    I mention the above because, boy, this film got panned by a lot of people when it came out. Much of the criticism was probably warranted, but it wasn't all that bad a film.It had its entertaining segments. For instance, the second scene with \\"The Hulk\\" fighting three dogs was very intense.    One of the problems was that it took 41 minutes for our hero, \\"The Hulk,\\" to show up! For a \\"superhero movie,\\" that's too long for the audience to wait. Don't get me wrong: I don't want one of these brainless nonstop action movies, but this was a tad too much in other direction. It needed just a little more spark to keep the audience involved.    It was good  to see they gave Lou Ferrigno a guest shot. That was a nice touch. Lou played the \\"monster\\" on the successful TV series.
B0000073OU|5.0|This is a great collection. No longer does my record player work, so I'm happy to find this collection on a modern format! I've been lucky enough to see the Selecter live...and this just brings memories flooding back! Just check out the track listing to see that you're not short changed on those fave. hits!<br /><br />All I can say is buy this, invite some friends around, roll back that carpet and crank it up!
0930289234|2.0|This is a mediocre comic at best.<br /><br />First, the art. Dave Gibbons exemplifies all the worst qualities of DC comics in the 80s. Stiff, wooden renderings with little sense of drama or action. Just terrible. Really, some of the worst comic art I've come across. And as far as the coloring goes... well, it borders on color-blindedness.<br /><br />The writing. Yes, Watchmen has more depth than the typical underpants-wearing superhero comic. But it also has far less depth than just about any book I've ever read. In fact, it almost certainly has less depth than the typical soap opera! Watchmen is largely about middle-aged ex-superheroes experiencing mid-life crises, trying to find their place in the world. The back story is an escalating nuclear conflict between the US and Russia, mixed in with a very shallow mystery dealing with the murder of a superhero, and tinged with lots of political undertones. This is not ground-breaking fiction by any means. Its not even particularly interesting. Watchmen is a mish-mash of every 80s clich&eacute;s, in tights, complete with a \\"Murder She Wrote\\" end of story explanation by the villain.<br /><br />Akira, Lone Wolf and Cub, and The Dark Knight Returns are far superior examples of the medium.

B0018M6J90|1.0|Miss Pettigrew serves up fluff instead of substance. It's romantic plotlines are weak, it's comedy driven by more by lust than humor, the best that can be said for it is that the sets were spectacular.   I would not recommend this film to any woman seeking an inoffensive chick-flick. The level of nudity in this film should have earned it an R rating, and it's insincere drivel about the importance of love (without any of the responsibility, authenticity or commitment real love engenders) was offensive instead of sweet. I shudder to think of teenage girls watching this for fun. A very unsatisfying \\"romp\\" that went straight from my DVD player into the garbage can.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I'm looking forward to this release of the Disney classic, however I'm wishing and hoping that the powers that be have not edited this wonderful film. Other Disney classics have been digitally edited for scenes of smoking i.e. Melody Time, the Pecos Bill character has had his cigarette digitally removed, also the scene of Goofy rolling a cigarette has been removed from Saludos Amigos. Can you imagine the scenes of Pinocchio and Lampwick at Treasure Island not having the cigar smoking and beer drinking included in this release. These scenes clearly warn children not to smoke or drink and hopefully will be included as originally filmed. Let's all wish upon a star that Disney has left this fine family film intact.

B00005JKNF|5.0|This play is a mystery, but that's an understatement.  It's also a documentary of the social manners and customs of a slice of life in the old-money priveleged class society.  The plot becomes more and more complex and subtly revealing of the underlying cross currents and hidden agendas of the wide variety of personalities of the guests gathered for a hunting party weekend.    Development of the mystery is so clever and subtle that it's not apparent until it explodes on the scene unexpectedly.  Every character is an interesting person so the combination of their actions makes for a fascinating story and a gimpse into a socological cross section.    Plan on seeing it at least twice because the ending is abrupt and has the viewer wondering what clues he overlooked along the way.  It's slow paced but very cleverly done.  Excellent acting and very realistic costumes and sets.  Good entertainment.  It grows on you.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Throughout an illustrious directing career Clint Eastwood has crafted some of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years, movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby. He has won five Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and the Irving Thalberg award.<br /><br />In the process the actors he has worked with have been blessed with Academy Awards: Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman in Million Dollar Baby, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins in Mystic River,and Gene Hackman in Unforgiven.<br /><br />With his other movie of 2008, Gran Torino, as Director and Actor he has delivered one of the best movies of the year, and one of his own most memorable performances, and now delivers another outstanding movie in Changeling.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for Girl Interrupted. Changeling marks her second nomination.<br /><br />A huge amount of credit for this movie though must go to writer J Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, who got a call one day, and the caller said: \\"We're throwing out some old records, and there is something you gotta see.\\"  A true story that beggars belief.<br /><br />Christine Collins' son was kidnapped, and the police returned to her 5 months later a boy who said his name was Walter Collins, but she said he was not her boy.  Her protests fall on the deaf ears of Police Capt JJ Jones played by Jeffrey Donovan of Burn Notice.  So begins one of the most notorious coverups of an already disreputable police department.<br /><br />The attention to detail in the story is nothing short of incredible,  particularly in the mental hospital scenes, which are very true to life. The psychiatrist excels at twisting her story to make her look nuts, using double binds to manipulate her, simultaneously threatening and cajoling her, with unknown potentially dangerous drugs or electric shock treatments.  (Either you're lying or you're nuts.) Amy Ryan plays the tart with a heart, an ally who explains the system, a small but very important role, and shocking.<br /><br />Oftentimes the Hollywood idea of a true story takes many liberties with the facts, distorting the actual events.  In this case, as far as I can discern nearly everything important is true, including meeting Northcott in San Quentin.<br /><br />A couple of minor facts have been changed. Her husband was in jail at the time of her son's kidnappping for armed robbery, not the explanation she gives her son.  A fact left out of the movie was that she pursued Capt JJ Jones legally for years, won judgments but never got any money out of him.<br /><br />What is up with Jeffrey Donovan's accent? He occasional lapses into a highly dubious stage Oirish accent, (which he probably got off his Burn Notice ex girlfriend, whose Oirish accent is also highly suspect).<br /><br />Angelina plays the part very well, neither going for hysteria nor a victim/martyr portrayal which would have ruined the movie.  She is more the reluctant crusader, who wins important allies along the way, changing important laws in LA.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood apparently wrote the music for the movie. The sequence of music with the montages at the end is particularly good. I also loved the performance of the good cop.

0765348276|5.0|The \\"danger\\" of reading a new author is that if you like him or her, you'll want to read everything the author has written.  For me, that is what happened with John Scalzi.  After reading and enjoying The Android's Dream, I went back to get his earlier works.  My next book by him was one of his earliest:  Old Man's War, and it shows that The Android's Dream was no fluke.    The main character is John Perry, a 75-year-old widower a couple centuries in the future.  Knowing his time is limited, he opts to join the military, particularly the Colonial Defense Forces, the army that not only protects all human colonies in the galaxy but also has a monopoly on space travel.  Joining the CDF gives Perry a chance for a literally new life:  he will be given a new body that is designed to fight.    Old Man's War is divided into three roughly equal parts.  In the first part, John joins the CDF and makes some new friends as he's taken to CDF headquarters to officially join and get his new body.  In the second part, he goes through basic training and fights his first battles, learning that the odds of surviving his stint are small; there are all sorts of nasty aliens out there, each with their own insidious killing methods.  The final part has John learning of the mysterious Ghost Brigades and joining them in a dangerous expedition.    An obvious influence for this book is Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, but Scalzi's work is still its own distinct story.  Scalzi has a light touch that provides some humor, but he never lets this lightness get out-of-hand; when things get bad, the comic element is pushed to the background.  I'm not a huge military science fiction fan, but Scalzi may change my mind about that subgenre:  this is an excellent book that shows why Scalzi is one of the great sci-fi writers of his generation.
B001BKM3MQ|5.0|The first 2 studio releases from John did nothing for me. They were simply regurgitated airy pop with nothing special in it. To me honest even when I heard \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" I thought it was the best song I had heard from him but I still wasn't overly impressed. It sounded like a wannabe Marvin Gaye number. BUT.....I was at another persons house and they happened to be playing the whole album and WOW! I stood there and listened amazed. There are hardly any artist today doing what John is doing. He's an old soul and he reminds me a lot of a mix between Marvin Gaye and Eric Clapton. Some songs start out (Gravity and Slow Dancing) and you'd SWEAR it was CLAPTON on guitar. Some songs (Dont Trust Myself, Vultures, Belief) go straight to channeling Marvin Gaye from the grave. Those two legendary artists are at the heart of what John does on this album and here's to him continuing in this sound. My fear is that this will be his signature album and he'll move out of this sound. (I hope not but his post-Continuum single, Say, feels more back to earlier Mayer) Please John, skip that airy pop and go into more soul. You're a decent singer, but you're a better guitar player. Let your guitar control your songs, when you do, magic appears.
0312944098|5.0|Archer has long been a favorite of mine, but when my husband was still reading at 2:30 in the morning, I knew Prisoner of Birth should receive 5 stars!  Some twists were expected; others surprised us pleasantly.  Even when an event was anticipated, the storyline to achieve that event was a delight.  We read a lot and have become more critical all the time, but Jeffery Archer certainly delivered with this novel.  While my husband read the book, I instead listened to the unabridged audiobook where Roger Allam's  reading was superb and added much to my enjoyment.
B001ED7C58|4.0|Thought soundtrack was great, was a little disappointed that the bonus track of \\"Let Me Sign\\" was not on it.
0810970686|5.0|Before reading them, I thought these books were geared more toward boys, but my daughters just love them!  They're clever, funny, unique and thoroughly enjoyable.  I hope the author continues to write, because I also work in a school library, and the kids there devour the Wimpy Kid books.
0743539133|5.0|The book is about Abraham Lincoln and the men who ran against him for the Republican nomination, namely Bates, Seward, and Chase.  Also featured are Grant, McClellan, and Stanton.  After the election Lincoln puts all of his rivals on his cabinet.  This book is about the interplay of this cabinet during the time of the Civil War.  If you are into the Civil War you will like this book, because there is much detail here.  Goodwin is an expert on the letters that Lincoln and his cabinet members wrote about and to one another.  If you like political maneuvering then you will like this book.  If you like a good biography of Lincoln, that is included, but this book is much more than that.  If you are looking for a good book about a great leader, then you will benefit from this book.  The book on CD is read by Richard Harris (aka John Boy from the Walton's) and is very well done.  The best thing about this book for me was that I felt like I had entered into the struggle with all of its grief and stark humanity with Lincoln.  When a book does that, then it was well written.   This is well worth the money.
B001FFBI82|1.0|What a horrible movie!!!  I tried to give it away but everyone that takes it gives it back after they watch it!!!  I can't believe I bought this when it first came out - \\"welcome to the suck\\" - yeah, now I know what that means after paying for this thing.    I'm a vet & can't understand any others enjoying this tripe.
B0010ZR160|2.0|Good movie but Casey Affleck was horrible.No expression & mumbles to the point of being incoherent.Ed Harris was excellent as always & Morgan excellent too.
0967175429|5.0|This is an awesome book! The book instructs you on how to reach the seventh plane along with commands for healing. It is a great recource I have found myself going back to it again and again.<br />It is best, however, when used in conjunction with one of Vianna's classes.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|The movie was good, but it was so loosely based on the original story that I felt let down. Liked the book better, but if I'd never read Robert Ludlum's \\"The Bourne Identity\\", I'd never have known.
B0000041WM|3.0|For a time there in the Nineites, we had two make-do Verdi baritones, Leo Nucci and Juan Pons, whose ascendacy was baffling. Here Nucci displays everything that was lacking. He sings Rigoletto in a very generalized way, with no vocal distinction, little regard for drama, and a marked inability to arouse pathos. A Rigoletto without a centrla character is sunk form the start. If you can get past this problem, however, you then must contend with chailly's tame conducting. In almost all his opera projects for Decca, chailly has attempted to add dignity to material others turn vulgar, but Rigoletto is vulgar -- it's hack melodramatic of the most popular flavor raised to the level of genius by Verdi's music.<br /><br />Chailly clearly disagrees, and he conducts as if this is Massenet. It's a shamee, buecause from here on out, there's a lot to enjoy. June Anderson is at her best in terms of vocal purity and beauty. She's a bit pastel dramatically, and not remotely Italianate. Still, her Gilda is appealngly vulnerable. And Pvarotti in 1990 is in good voice for his age, giving a much more secure rading than he would just a few years later on DG for Levine.  The Duke was a signature role, and Pavarotti brings seventy prcent of his best, which was given full flower in his first, famous recording with Joan Sutherland, also on Decca.<br /><br />I see no reason to go into more detail, althoug it should be noted tht the recorded sound is very natural and appealing. This recording improves on Bonynge's conducting in that early Rigoletto, but its vocal glories are only approximated.
0385340990|1.0|I am an avid reader, reading 1-2 books a week.  I read all the reviews and thought this would be a great choice.  Boy was I wrong.  It is so BORING, nothing exciting or suspenseful is happening - the interactions between the Nazis and the Islanders are so unrealistic.  I just couldn't take any more of the not funny humor and the boring, simplistic letters.  I went on to read something better.  Hey everyone, there are many great stories out there to read, why is everyone gushing over this?  It'a a waste of time.
B000FC2JTS|1.0|If this jerk is a the typical male then no wonder women choose to be alone!  Seem's more like he wrote the most offensive material he could to sell a book to make a lot of money.  I couldn't find anything at all accurate or intereseting in here. If women take this book serious it would be a huge mistake.  This clown has no idea what he is talking about!  Even Amazon ask's if the reviewer is over 13. Too bad they don't apply the same scrutiny to their author's!

B000AP04OM|5.0|I've watched \\"The Sound of the Music\\" few times before on a laser disc, and enjoyed it vey much.  This is my first time I bought it in a DVD, so I don't know how much improvement in this 40th special edition from previous versions.  The picture and sound qualities are fine, and I like the sub-title feature.  This helps me to understand every words that they speak.  Juliet Andews' commentary is at the beginning of Disc 1, and I have to press the \\"next\\" key on the remote to skip to the menu screen to start the movie, I find that's quite annoying.  This movie is in a wide screen, so there are black bars on both sides, top and bottom of my TV.  If I enlarge it, the picture become blurry slightly.  So, I watch it in  a normal mode which makes my 52\\" HDTV like a 46\\" tv. It's still ok.
B001CP4VMU|4.0|Very good movie. I first saw this movie in theaters, then owned it on VHS well since I recently got a blu-ray this movie was a must for me to get. This picture was a big improvement. The reason I give it 4 stars is because of the dolby HD I have a 7.1 Surround and a reciever that supports Dolby HD and Was not overly inpressed with the sound. The music played good and some explosions but overall background noises not so good. I do love all the extras they put into this dvd. This is a must get Blu-ray thanks Amazon.
0930289234|4.0|I could not put Watchmen DOWN!!! YET, when the PLOT WAS REALIZED. NOT VERY CREATIVE GIVEN THE ENDLESS POSSIBLE SCENARIOS!!  Character's had depth if you can transport yourself back in the hay day! LASTLY, ONLY ONE SUPERPOWER. Yet, I think it gives an essence to a real world hero's.  Rather than X-Men and such. I am lost about why there is a \\"sub-novel\\" within it, i must have missed the reasoning for it?
B001GMH8TM|5.0|Well, this is a definite favorite of mine. The film itself, that is. If you like Jim Carrey in not-as-funny-as-dramatic movies, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, you'll love this. If you just like his comedies like The Mask and Ace Ventura, well, this might not be for you, but worth a look. It's not necessarily a comedy, obviously a drama, but a bit of a laugh every once in a while. Even being dramatic, it's still a very enjoyable movie, and his performance is great. I've read some comments where people say \\"I don't see why people love this movie so much, anybody could play Truman Burbank,\\" and, well, that's just fantastic, but they didn't, so why moan about it. Anyway, as for the movie itself, yes, it's great, I absolutely love it.    Moving on, the Blu-Ray. Welp, I've had a rather up and down experience with this. It's one of the better Blu-Rays of 10+ year old movies, that's for sure. Occasionally it gets really grainy, kind of DVD quality, but that's hardly consistent, only in some shots, and kind of makes sense as those shots are usually supposed to be from tiny, bizarrely placed, hidden cameras. That being said, it does get annoying going from a crisp picture to all of a sudden DVD quality, but overall the quality is great. The audio is great, as well. Compared to the DVD, you hear more things, and crisper, as well. Things like the waves, the sound of cloth, sighs and all those little things just sound better. The special features are rather disappointing, unfortunately. The trailers seem horribly unfitting for the film. The scenes taken out are, for the most part, uninteresting(which makes it obvious as to why they were taken out), but also in standard 640x480. I don't fully understand this entire \\"Make the movie 1080p 16:9 and the special features 480i 4:3\\" thing some studios are doing, but this Blu-Ray has that. Not that it bothers me too much, I bought this movie on Blu-Ray to enjoy the movie itself.    Would I suggest this to anyone? Mmm, maybenot ANYONE, but anyone who's able to grasp the main idea of the movie. Some of the people I've shown it to didn't quite understand what the main plot was. So, I would only suggest this if you understand the main idea or point first.    If you've decided on buying it, but don't know if the extra bucks are worth it for the Blu-Ray over the DVD, I can only say yes. I won't get technical, but there's really no way an upconverter can give as good a picture as a real blu-ray, too much is forever lost in translation. Buy it on Blu-Ray. You won't regret it.
B00129H7VS|4.0|I'll start out by saying that while i love this series... im not very impressed with this transfer.   i own the standard dvd version also and the blu ray version not really any better... truth. it looks good. but i was expecting a bit more...   blu ray discs hold what? like 50 gigs if data? and they only have 2 episodes on each disc. just like the dvd. i know they could have put at least 4 or 5 episodes on each disc. at the least 3. and cut down on the number of discs.   so if id not have bought the dvd, i probably would not feel this way.   buy this if only you dont own the dvd. dont buy it thinking that you'll get a better picture. yes it looks good but no different than the dvd.

1878424602|4.0|While I enjoyed this immensely, and found it inspirational, I also found it just a bit simple. Chopra admits to founding his ideas on Eastern philosopyies and teachings, and the ideas themselves are nothing new, but for those unfamiliar with Karman, Vedanta, Hindu teachings, and the rest, this will come as something new. The basic idea that we create our own happiness is also not new, but Chopra does put a different twist on this plan. Certainly there is nothing bad here, I just wish it had been a bit more detailed in the \\"how to fix\\" things.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|Was definitely hesitant to buy this DVD. but got it since I'm a fan of Ridley Scott movies. And as it turns out it was a dark tension packed movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Little known, Mark Strong gave the best performance as Hani a corrupt head of Jordanian Intelligence. It appears most of low ratings were given by reviewers based on preconceptions before they watched the movie. Well thats too bad!  Enjoy!

B001P9KR8U|5.0|I have seen this movie 3 times in the theatre, and each time, it touches my heart in a different way...it was only while watching it for the 2nd time that I realized that the love story between the two brothers is almost as powerful as the love story between Jamal and Latika.  True, they are completely different in their \\"make up\\", and grow into two very different young men, but the love is there...definitely.  Salim's choice, for example, is completely filled with love for his brother, as well as his deep love for Allah.  He knows what he needs to do, and does it.  And who can't be touched by Jamal's statement to Latika that \\"Salim will help us\\"?  In his heart, he never gave up on his brother.    Yes, there's poverty and violence in this film, but I also think that one of the most beautiful statements this movie makes is about the bonds we form in childhood-- how they shape us as adults, and, ultimately, how we choose to treat each other as life kicks us around a bit.  It really doesn't matter if you grew up in the slums of Mumbai or Beverly Hills, we all carry life's \\"events\\" around with us, and what shows on the surface is how we've chosen to assimilate, conquer, or push them aside...if we can.    Of course, that little ingredient called DESTINY can't be overlooked, either!      I LOVE this film.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I don't like to rate movies or music because everyone has different tastes, but this is an exception. Great acting, likely well-deserved awards. An interesting dark plot with even Batman thinking about things. The Joker you have heard about. Simply an amazing performance. Some think it is the best acting job ever. Who knows about that, but it is exceptional for sure.    Great sound! Huge explosions and other dramatic sounds. Your speakers will be put to the test and your subwoofer can't be too big. More power definitely needed. It must be watched at high volume levels! At least one guest should be uncomfortable.    If you live in a noise-issue building, then just see it at IMAX or at least a modern theater with a good sound system.    I don't buy many movies as I am not one to watch anything more than once, but this is one that is worth having.    It is tooooo long, though. It goes on and on, well after  you think it is near the logical ending. That is not good, and many people will want to pause it for food, bathroom and for just a break!  That is why it is so suitable for home viewing. At a theater you have to either tough it out or miss some of the movie.
B001QB9H1A|4.0|\\"Transporter 3\\" is a high-action action film that shows off what has been the endearing traits that has caused this series to be a hit at the theater and worldwide, and that's a good thing because this episode of the series suffers from too much imitation of star Jason Statham's other films. It is as if the producers felt that they had to borrow elements of Crank and Death Race to assure that the series' fans wouldn't desert it.<br /><br />Statham again plays Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces soldier who lives in Marseilles and works as a \\"Transporter,\\" someone who delivers merchandise in his black Audi no questions asked. This time, he is forced to deliver a package in the trunk, and a young woman sitting in the back seat. He and the woman are fitted with bracelets that will explode if either one strays too far from Martin's vehicle. Martin struggles to figure out what is going on with his forced clients, the identity of the girl, who isn't forthcoming with information, and how to remove the bracelets without killing himself and the girl.<br /><br />Because of the lack of confidence of the producers, we are forced to endure not just car chases and crashes, but way over-the-top car stunts reminiscent of the Death Race film, and the bracelet device smacks of Crank, where Statham was a hit man injected with a poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops, causing him to move at a frenetic pace for most of that film so he won't die. In this film, Statham has to perform all kinds of stunts to keep up with the vehicle so he won't blow up.<br /><br />Fortunately, the film is also keeps the martial arts action, witty script, and the endearing relationship between Martin and local detective Tarconi, played by Francois Berleand. Also, the woman, played by Natalya Rudokova, is charming enough to help overcome some of the irritation at the film's imitations.<br /><br />Transporter 3 is worth seeing, but if there is a fourth film, one hopes that the film will find ways to revitalize without cannibalizing the star's other films.the star's other films.
0060581808|5.0|I loved this book as a young girl and now I'm reading to my class at school.  The new colored pictures are beautiful and the children can't wait to see what will happen next.  In a world of technology and instant gratification, the children enjoy reading about the simple yet difficult life of Laura Ingalls.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Hilarious comedy series about a group of \\"brainy geeks\\" and their efforts to negotiate everyday social situations. While laugh out loud funny most of the time, the heroes are endearing and the humor is not nasty.  We have shared these videos with many friends, all of whom have found them equally entertaining.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This was such fun to watch. I really enjoyed how Catherine visualized herself in the Gothic scenes she imagined because she loved to read Gothic novels.Good humor,drama and beautiful scenery.<br /><br />I really liked all the characters,except did not care for the unattractive and unappealing John Thorpe,nor his frequent use of the word d**n,and it was totally unbelievable and ridiculous to have Henry's character think that John Thorpe was better looking than himself,UGH!<br /><br />Great points about the different facets of friendships and betrayal. Very engaging story,and I highly recommend Northanger Abbey for lovers of romance films.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|So far this is the only version of Persuasion that I have seen so far,and I thought it was ok,despite the fact that I usually avoid films and books that are full of 'angst' as almost this entire film is.<br /><br />I haven't yet read any of the novels by Jane Austen,so I cannot judge how true to the book it is.<br /><br />My real problem was that I didn't much care for the character of Anne Elliot(Sally Hawkins),I thought she was incredibly dull,and it was totally unbelievable that the 'Drop Dead GORGEOUS'(but his acting here doesn't thrill either)Frederick Wentworth(Rupert Perry-Jones) would have fallen for such a plain Jane,and pined for years for her!<br /><br />Now I want to see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.<br /><br />So I can't really recommend this version.
B00009XITP|4.0|When it comes to this film, I am so utterly in the wrong demographics that I feel quite silly putting in my two cents' worth - but here it is, anyway. Sometimes you flip thru channels and stumble on a movie that you somehow end up seeing all the way thru. So, for me and WHAT A GIRL WANTS. Young Amanda Bynes has never really registered on my radar before, but it's hard not to get in her corner when you see her perky self go to work.<br /><br />Seems like nothing is original anymore. WHAT A GIRL WANTS has drawn comparisons to [[ASIN:B000209KMW The Princess Diaries (2-Disc Collectors Set)]], but apparently its roots go back further, to a 1958 comedy film THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE starring Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee, which in turn was adapted from a 1956 play of the same name by some cat named William Douglas Home. Cinderella, of course, is the grandmama of inspirations for movies like this.<br /><br />WHAT A GIRL WANTS is fluff fluffity fluff, but enjoyable and the sort of lighthearted, lightweight teen chick flick which the young girl audiences (and I guess, me) gobble up like M&Ms. There's even a touch of that girl-empowerment thing going on. But if you say you can't guess how the plot will play out, then pardon me but my bullcrap detector just exploded. The set-up goes like this: 17 years ago, a young British noble (Colin Firth) and a gorgeous, free-spirited American girl (Kelly Preston) meet and fall in love in Morocco and get married in a bedouin wedding ceremony. He takes her to his posh estates in England, only to have disapproving forces scheme to separate the two. She leaves in tears, he lets her leave. He doesn't know she's pregnant.<br /><br />Amanda Bynes plays New York teenager Daphne Reynolds who runs away from her single parent mother to seek out her Englishman dad in London. To catch us up, Daphne's father is now Lord Henry Dashwood, currently engaged to be married and a popular candidate in the upcoming elections (and he still doesn't know he has a daughter). So, as you may guess, Daphne's unexpected arrival introduces a wrench in the works, a fly in the ointment, a fart in the wind. Bring on the belles and balls and the anticipated father-daughter culture clash, as the rest of the movie tells of how plucky and sweet collide with repressed and snooty.<br /><br />What's a story like this, though, without a wicked social-climbing stepmummy or a conniving step-sister? There's even a dashing young Jack-of-all-trades to lend a hand to Daphne, as well as a kindly British grandmum who we sense from the start would have Daphne's back and who ends up with film's best line (that one about hugs). But the real connection is between Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth's daughter and dad characters. It's quite fun watching Daphne gradually begin to have an effect on her stiff upper-lipped father and seeing this portrait of restraint and decorum loosen up by inches. The film's high point for me may well be that scene with Lord Dashwood in tight leather pants playing air guitar in front of the mirror.<br /><br />Bonus features? The DVD offers the following: two sets of audio commentary, one by the film director and the screenwriters, the other by Amanda Bynes (for those preferring a more, like, youthful testimonial); \\"Fashion and Etiquette 101\\" - the film's costume designer Shay Cunliffe goes over the cast's wardrobe and etiquette instructor Maggie O'Farrill nags about the proprieties; \\"What's A Girl To Wear?\\" - a game requiring a good memory for Daphne's outfits (as a guy, I refuse to play this); 3 additonal scenes (totalling 1 minute 39 seconds); the theatrical trailer; and the film cast & crew credits.<br /><br />WHAT A GIRL WANTS pushes all the right feel-good buttons and rides on the talent and credibility of the cast. Amada Bynes demonstrates an unaffected, likeable quality, nicely balancing her goofy exuberance with pratfalls and even a dash of romance. With her, the stodgy Brits never really had a chance. Equally key is Colin Firth, pitch perfect as the impeccable, uncomfortable Lord Dashwood, who as the film progresses regains that inner cool he had back in his youth, when he listened to rock 'n roll and sported a more hip wardrobe. Firth manages to pull off being simultaneously reserved yet charming. Again. Having seen [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]] and [[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)]], I shouldn't be surprised. Kelly Preston is good as Libby, Daphne's beautiful Bohemian mom who raises Daphne to be carefree yet grounded; You could see why even after all these years Lord Dashwood still thinks of her. Libby is a wedding singer, which gives Preston a chance to actually sing the songs. She's not bad.<br /><br />Sappy last paragraph: This film may be tailored for the youngsters, but it doesn't necessarily snub the old fogies. When I told a buddy of mine that I'd seen this movie and liked it, he dismissed the film as fluff fluffity fluff. Obviously, I disagree. There's always a place for charming teen comedy flicks, not only in the hearts of young whippersnappers, but also in the wrinkled cockles of the decrepit. In its predictability and retelling of that same old message (be true to yourself), it doesn't insult our intelligence as much as reaffirm certain values. So I take back what I said about not being in this film's target demographics.

0393330435|5.0|I bought the audio book online and listen on my iphone and macbook over and over.  Why?  I am not an engineer but at age 46 I converted to Apple and it has changed my life. Woz and Jobs wanted to make computers affordable and easy enough to use by everyone and they have succeeded.  I am proof.  In less than a year Apple has taught me how to make podcasts and youtubes using imovie.  I filmed a homeless man playing sax, Giuseppie Logan and rocked the jazz world because people thought he was dead. [...] Here is the link and I made a typo so I redid it but left the original up because it was so meaningful and part of the learning process.  The story is moving and with a video just over a minute long I was able to move people globally like a powerful film but on my laptop with a technology I did not know existed until I took one on one classes at Apple;  99 dollars for the entire year for an hour class once a week.  That is a radical idea of Apple's, teaching people to actually understand and use their computer.<br /><br />Why do I love iWoz?  The stress levels in NYC are off the charts and when I turn on iWoz I find myself laughing!!!!  The man who reads the book to you has the warmest most animated voice and he delivers some of the lines like a gifted stand up comedian.  The writing and the reader's voice exude a vibe that everything is going to be alright, believing in possibilities of all kinds and I find myself comforted, educated and entertained.<br /><br />Woz values humor and pranks.  On defining pranks I would have to call Woz semantically challenged and being an A type personality, relieved not to have a Woz prank played on me.  At one point he asks if you think he is bragging and I saw yes but he is entitled...just a little...smile.  Okay, a lot.  I now use the word micro- processor because I heard it over and over.  I looked it up in \\"how stuff works\\" microprocessor the heart of the computer.  Woz has heart.  He tells you how he sold stock to loyal Apple employees before Apple went public and I gather that generous act help Apple to make more millionaires than an other public offering at the time.  Semantics work for Woz because when Steve Jobs short changes him on an Atari project Woz decides Job's is just different yet Steve Job's savvy was key to get Woz's computer out of the garage.  Job's is a genius with computers and making dynamic world changing things happen. Their differences worked like yin and yang to create Apple and my year anniversary to converting to Apple is coming up.  I find myself turning to iWoz when ever I feel upset like when I am having way too intimate experience because subway cars in NYC are too crowded or someone is profoundly upsetting me I turn on iWoz and listen.  I find myself feeling better, hopeful, optimistic and I find myself laughing.  Woz values having fun and he is right.  Life is too short and in NYC too aggravating and stressful.  I play iWoz over and over.  I recommend this book on audio.

1932907009|5.0|I've tried every screenwriting approach out there (Robert McKee, Syd Field, Dave Trottier, and so on) and I can easily say that Blake Snyder's Save the Cat offers the most original and insightful screenwriting template to date.   Using Blake's techniques, I've improved my own writing significantly and it has helped me view my stories from both a creator's and a prospective producer's perspective.  Trust me, I used to be a writer who believed that the ART of storytelling trumped the BUSINESS side of storytelling.  But, there's no denying it: screenwriting is as much about the business (i.e. \\"selling your screenplay\\") as it is about the art, and Blake helps you make this transition without sacrificing your work or \\"selling out\\".      Blake debunks the use of conventional genres (i.e. comedy, drama, western, etc.) and offers 10 new genres that focus more on HOW THE STORY IS TOLD.  He traces these genres back to their mythological roots and shows how each relates to our own inherent nature, so that they will effectively translate to audiences all over the world.  Saving Private Ryan and Little Miss Sunshine are the same story?  What? Don't believe me?  Just try it.  They are.    Additionally, the inclusion of his own Beat Sheet is worth the price of the book alone.  All of the other screenwriting books emphasize the common 4-5 beats of a screenplay (i.e. inciting incident, climax, act breaks, etc.).  Blake provides 15 beats that will help you structure your story in the spaces between -- those places where us writers commonly run into road blocks. You will come out of it with a well-structured screenplay.  Don't believe me?  Again, just try it.    One last thing:  I'm the type who commonly skips pages in \\"how-to\\" manuals when the writing becomes too dense.  Blake won't allow you to skip -- his prose is spread out, witty, and entertaining. It only focuses on the essential bits and never runs on and on, like most screenwriting books.  It's actually like reading a good screenplay.   It was truly a pleasure to read.      So take a chance and buy this book (along with Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies).  It will surely exceed your expectations and you will be one step closer to an original, sellable screenplay!

0930289234|5.0|Back in 1986, A series of issues of one story entitled \\"Watchmen\\" was released in 12 issues. In 2002, all issues were released in one giant graphic novel entitled \\"Watchmen\\", and since then it has become the most celebrated comic book of all time. Back in December, I had bought myself a copy after seeing the trailer, but put off reading it. But back on a trip to Mexico, I picked it up and began reading it, and I couldn't put it down. I finished it in 3 days and I loved it so much I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />One thing that came across as amazing to me was how this wasn't a superhero comic book. It was a comic book that dealt with many of the problems in the modern world. And these characters are so undeniably tragic yet you can't help but feel drawn to them. The best character to me is Dr. Manhattan, the De-atomized blue naked guy you see in the trailer. He is a superhuman, he can make himself taller than the CN towner, and do... well, anything. But is it worth it to him? He has detached himself from humanity, and he's just the character that,s impossible to not love.<br /><br />I was really blown away by this graphic novel, and I loved it so much I read it a second time. Now we have the movie coming out, and that said, I can't wait for the movie. Opening night, this is gonna be a blast?<br /><br />Even if you are not into comic books, do read this amazing work of art. It will blow you away. It is an epic page turner that will keep you on the edge of your seat, not wanting to put the book down. The only thing I didn't like was that it had to end! I wanted it to be longer, as it could go on for another 500 pages and I'd still read it. But case in point, do read this work of art, because it is essential to all literature lovers.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|Excellent movie with a new type of heroine. No one rants about how beautiful, gentle, kind and intelligent she is. She's clumsy, insecure and feels like she's failing her family. Mulan is someone that most girls will relate to at some level.    Yet, she displays courage and stamina beyond any other Disney heroine. When it all comes down to it, (with the possible exception of Pocahontas), all the Disney gals need to be \\"rescued\\" by a prince or other supporting characters. She doesn't. SHE'S the hero at the end, combining both masculine strategy with feminine guile. The romance isn't quite so blatant and she can get along perfectly without a prince at the end. He comes to HER.    On another note, the grandmother was better comic relief than Mushu.    The animation is spectacular: the battle with the Huns, the Imperial palace and the mountain scenes are particularly breath-taking.    However, as a student of medieval history, I would have liked the Huns or Hsiung-nu as the Chinese called them, to be shown as shorter and that their saddles had stirrups--they were the first people to make widespread use of them.    Still, great movie.
0743454537|3.0|I purposely try to stay away from reading customer reviews before I read a book just in case an inadvertent spoiler is thrown in, however there was no way that I could not have heard about how great Jodi Picoult's book `MY SISTERS KEEPER' was or about the controversy surrounding the \\"shocking ending\\".  This is one of the reasons why I wanted `MY SISTERS KEEPER' to be my first Picoult book and from the moment I picked it up I was virtually unable to put it down.<br /><br />I stole a few minutes here and there every chance I could to read about the Fitzgerald family's struggle to save one child while seemingly sacrificing another.  I understood why some readers disliked Sara, the mother, yet I could understand the tough choices she was forced to make and while I may not have agreed with them all I could definitely empathize.  I felt for Anna  the 13 year old girl who felt that she was trapped between a rock and a hard place having to be forced to always come to her sisters rescue and Kate the dying sister who was sick of dying.  I loved every bit of it as I cried my way through  the better part of the book.<br /><br />Then I got to the \\"shocking finale\\" of the book.  The finale that  made me rethink everything that I previously thought of `MY SISTERS KEEPER'.  Did I still love the book whose ending I absolutely hated?  An ending that I thought was gimmicky and pointless in an already heart wrenching and  difficult book.  The answer is, I still don't know.  Even months later I am still on the fence about how I feel about `MY SISTERS KEEPER'.  I even went out and bought and read another  Picoult book just to see if this particular book just took a wrong turn.  In the end I decided to give what I thought for 99%  of the book was a 5 star novel  3.5 stars .  You will either  love it or hate it but you will definitely want to talk about it!

I found it between the 2 disc special edition of Iron Man and Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity. I suggest throwing away the plastic case that the mask comes in cause you're really not gonna need it. So it is the same as the 2 disc edition. I would use the Hall of Armor feature most. This is also like The Dark Knight Batman Head Case. I recomend buying it.

B001IB63KQ|5.0|i like watching concert videos between the times i actually go to concerts. i've seen a lotta concerts & watched a lotta videos. i can remember in the mid 80's i had a roommate who played AC/DC \\"Let There Be Rock\\" like every night for over a month. so i sat through that video like 30+ times (& all the drugs & alcohol i did back then aren't just clouding my memory). obviously, i told that story for years. one of the greatest videos of all time is Iron Maiden \\"Live After Death\\" (recently remastered) &  i missed the \\"Powerslave\\" tour even though i made it to both \\"Somewhere In Time\\" & \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\" which are still to this day the greatest concert performances ever. i've seen Slayer five times & i remember buying Slayer \\"War At The Warfield\\" & thinking it was more than just the music, but the quality of the video that made it good. i watched that one more than 30+ times. a friend of mine turned me on to The GoGos \\"Live In Central Park\\" in 2001 & the quality of the video made the reunion of the 80's all girl punk rock band better than ever. Jane is a little hotter than Belinda just because she's less of a snob. guess how many times i watched that one?<br /><br />i worshiped long haired dudes & thrash metal bands for like 20 years & i still wonder what i was thinking. i still like good music no matter who's singing but lately i prefer chics that sing. if i wanna hear some dude sing, i'll sing to myself in the shower. dudes that sing for bands & don't play instruments are just lame cuz any dude can sing, 'der'. (of course i confess that i did like Avenged Sevenfold \\"Live At The LBC\\"). i caught Evanescence for the first time on \\"The Open Door\\" & bootlegged the \\"Live In Chile\\" video. anyone who cuts on Evanescence is stupid & knows less about music than they do about life. The reason why \\"Anywhere But Home\\" is a great video is because 1) they have great songs & 2) you find out who they are in the 'behind the scenes footage'. They turn out to be regular down to earth southern folks from little rock even though they tend to portray a dark psycho goth image.<br /><br />i finally heard \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" in early '07 & didn't think much of it even though i did catch Van's '05 @ Columbia Meadows, i don't remember Paramore playing the Bally stage. (i remember seeing Lillix & thinking, 'the singer is a hottie') so by the time \\"Riot\\" hit the shelf & Van's '07 came around, Paramore was making a big splash as the band that got an extra 15 minutes of playing time due to the KUFO radio fan request. so i stood in line for autographs & got to meet the band & i was up front for Circa Survive who played right before Paramore. after that, i was hooked. i missed EndFest later that year, but Labor Day 2008 was Paramore w/ Offspring & Death Cab For Cutie @ Bumbershoot. check out the clips of that show in this video & you'll see the size of the Seattle crowd is no joke, especially for a show that started @ 2:00 in the afternoon. yes, they take their concerts seriously in Seattle, & yes i was up front for that show, & yes i have the pics to prove it. Bumbershoot was the last U.S. show they played before the MTV music awards.<br /><br />i've watched this video 50+ times. the 'behind the scenes' footage shows the Franklin Tennessee band are regular people w/ exceptional talent for their age. Josh is obviously the mastermind musical genius. Jeremy is next in line. They're all a little nerdy & the christian undertones give them a certain clean kinda style. Haley put on a little weight during the Riot tour which is a good thing cuz she was kinda thin when i saw her @ Van's. but what's w/ the dude's pants & she looks like she has big feet (or just big white shoes). i think she should cuss a little more. in 2007-2008 Sirius Octane played 'Misery Business' more times than they played Linkin Park 'Bleed It Out'. i've heard a lot of complaints from people who think they're old school & complain about the quality of modern music. the problem istoo many people live in the past & they're stuck on worshiping long haired dudes that sing. there's plenty of good music out there if you know where to look. open your minds & ears people. Paramore really does rock!! See them on tour this summer w/ No Doubt.in the past & they're stuck on worshiping long haired dudes that sing. there's plenty of good music out there if you know where to look. open your minds & ears people.

B001H5X7I4|5.0|This film pays homage to several great war films such as Bridge over the River Kwai, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan.  We see the camraderie build as in a classic war film.  I can overlook the Howard Stern-type crudeness and admire the finesse of the cinematography, and the dead-on impressions of Hollywood.  The real meaning of the movie is that the U.S. lost the Vietnam War, but Hollywood not only won the war but conquered the world.  It should be watched by anyone whose childhood happened during the Vietnam war, because it is therapeutic.  But another reason that I, as a woman, watch it?  Incredibly hot guys in uniform!
0810970686|5.0|Any book that gets the poverty-stricken 4th grade students in my classroom excited about reading AND writing gets my vote as a top book.  The fact that this third entry in the Wimpy Kid diaries is laugh-out-loud funny only enhances the book's charm and winning content.  The book reaches across economic and racial lines and has appeal to all children in the 8-15 year old age groups I encounter.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and series, especially for reluctant readers.

031606792X|1.0|I, again, wanted to like this book.  Pages and pages stretched out filled with irrelevant detail.  For instance, the wolf watch went on for chapter after chapter for nothing.  The wolves never had any confrontations to fight in.  Then, page after page went on discussing how tired the wolves were during their watch.  How many times did we have to hear this?    As Bella's pregnancy progressed, we had to endure endless descriptions of everyone's facial expressions as they kept a vigil at her bedside.    Every scene froze while we heard about what everybody's face was doing.  We even had to pause and find out when someone would blink or take a breath.  Come on!  These things are understood.  Do we need to hear about them in every scene?    One scene involves Bella walking up to her daughter to hold her.  Meyer described the facial expressions of eight different people as she took EACH STEP!  And yes, their breathing patterns too.  Painful to read.     Some detail is necessary to set a scene and give the reader an idea of the setting.  This much detail, while attempting to build tension, stretches it out to the point of angering the reader like someone beating around the bush who refuses to get to the point.    Get to the point, Meyer!  It took you 700+ pages to tell a story that could have been done in 200.      Ugh!    I want my money back.

0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is a great deep story. It is about a 13 year old girl named Anna who was born specifically to be a perfect match for her sister Kate, who is struggling with a rare form of cancer. She has always been sleflessly donating to Kate on numerous occasions. Then, when Kate needs a new kidney, Anna puts her foot down. She decides to sue her parents for medical amancipation. The whole book is about the inner struggle of many of the characters. Jess, is the older brother who helps Anna out because he supports what she is doing. As the reader would guess, this tears the family apart. Anna seems like such a sweet innocent girl who would never do anything like this, especially to her sister since she sees her as her \\"best friend.\\" Anna gets a lawyer to represent her against her mother (who just so happens to be a lawyer as well.) The book is filled with twists and turns and keeps the reader interested at all times. This was the first Jodi Picoult book i've read and it will not be my last. I have heard though, that many of her books are sad which seems to be true, but still the topic of the book is very grasping. The end is a complete shock and i recommend that you read it alone, as many people cry at the end, you get that into the book. What Anna is doing doesn't make sense the entire book until the end, which was a complete surprise for me. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind a book that isnt completely up beat but that is deep.

0440241413|1.0|I bought this to calm some airplane jitters three days after the \\"miracle on the Hudson\\" crash...but after trying to read it on the plane, I decided my 'In Style' magazine had more substance.<br /><br />I didn't think Diary of Bridget Jones was all that good, but Becky Bloomwood makes Bridget Jones look like a stable, kind person. Also, the author rips off so many scenes from BJ that all one can think is, \\"Oh, Helen Fielding wrote this cooking /television/repeated motif (of BJ's lost weight turned into Becky's lost bank account) so, so much better!<br /><br />It's just bad, all the way around.
0307269752|5.0|Sorry - I couldn't resist the alliteration in the title of this review.  But I really love this book!  I stayed up entirely too late reading it, but made myself put it down before finishing the last few pages.  I don't want it to end!  It's that good.  And I'm enjoying the mental stretch of the Swedish setting, since I know little about the country.  One of the best books I've read in the past few years and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know.  And all of you people I don't know too!
0743496736|5.0|Nineteen minutes is once again, a great read by Jodi Picoult. The book is about a highschool shooting. I absolutely loved the way this book was written. The book begins with the shooting, then takes you back in time. It starts off before the shooter was even born, then goes back to a day after the shooting. Then when the shooter was in kindergarten, then 2 days after the shooting, etc. Until the end when it has a minute- by- minute detail of the day of the shooting and everything comes together. This format helps the reader get to see how the character have come to be who they are, which is very important for this book. Peter Houghton, the shooter, has been bullied non-stop since day one. Josie Cormier, was his one and only friend until highschool when she decided she had to ditch him in order to become popular. Josie's mother, Alex Cormier, is a judge who was supposed to sit in on the trial but was kicked off when her daughter became a witness. Josie's long time boyfriend Matt, was killed in the shooting, but questions arise when he was the only one shot twice. Josie's world turns upside down since she was with Matt the time of the shooting. Peter has specificallyu targeted certain people in the school to go after. The reader is constantly guessing how in the world Peter could do something like this, since during his entire childhood he has been nothing but kind and innocent. This book is very strong and gets the reader thinking, arguing with whom they should sympathize and empathize. The end literally made my jaw drop, i definitely didnt see it coming which makes her books just that much better. Its always boring to have a predictable ending but this one was great, and still leaves me wondering how she came up with it in the first place. It brings up many topics and something that everyone deals with- bullying at school. I think this is a book that everyone should read.
1577314808|5.0|Great book.   This is a timely theme, combining themes from all major religions.  Very relevant for today
0307346617|4.0|I would never have picked this book up had it not been for a firm endorsement by a friend. I'm not generally interested in this type of genre, but World War Z is not the type of book that the cover and title would suggest. While a world-wide zombie plague is the springboard premise for the book, the premise is used not to horrify but to examine what would happen to modern society should it suddenly collapse. The premise could just as easily had been something realistic like a new viral plague and you would have wound up with the same book.<br /><br />The after-the-fact oral history motif that Brooks uses didn't initially seem like it could sustain an entire book -- but it did. After the first couple of chapters, I became more engaged in the survivor's descriptions of how they made it through the war. What makes the book work is the realistic analysis of what would likely happen to ordinary people, from all walks of life, around the world in the event of a planetary struggle. Through his characters, Brooks offers an insightful view of how various world governments, religious and military leaders might realistically respond to an unrealistic source of collapse.
B000YAA68W|4.0|This movie was recommended by a friend as I am originally Iranian. I purchased it and watched it a couple of times. It is very well done and enjoyed it emensely.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a short, laugh out loud, light read. I recommend it to read during the summer because i read it during the school year and found it pretty difficult to write a 6 page report on it.   It is about an innocent boy named Charlie who is going through his freshmen year of high school. His best friend Michael commits suicide because of \\"problems at home\\" and Charlie is left without friends. At first, he is okay with this- Charlie tends to keep to himself anyway. But then at his first football game without Michael, Charlie meets Patrick and Sam, who are seniors and brother and sister. They quickly become friends with Charlie and are extremely kind to him, they seem to understand him as well. Charlie is definitely an odd ball. He weaves many \\"life quotes\\" throughout the book. One, for example is \\"I love twinkies, and the reason i am telling you this is because we are all supposed to find something to live for.\\" His innocence in this mook makes it interesting and will cause you to laugh out loud at some points. The beginning of the book is great, and the middle is good, then the end is bad. It just seems to go downhill because despite that it is charlie's freshmen year of high school- that doesnt necessarily mean he will try EVERYTHING. The book becomes unrealistic and the end is just bad. I was mad after i read the ending, i had to re-read it in the first place just to understand what the author was trying to infer, I suppose i should have guessed, it is a MTV book, so it doesnt have a whole lot of depth. Personally, id give it a 3.5 if i could. The funny thing about this book is that my 2 best friends read it for school too and one absolutely loved it and said it is her favorite book, while the other absolutely hated it and said he was mad for reading it. It can be a very controversal book, but it only takes 3-4 hours to read so if you've got some time to kill, knock urself out and form your own opinion.  The books format is interesting.The main character, Charlie, is writing letters to an annoymous person. The reader never finds out who he's writing to, but it seems like it is someone Charlie doesnt know personally. Als, you never find out some of the character's names. Charlie just calls them My uncle or My sister.   Good, not great.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Looks utterly Fantasic on Blu Ray.... A Must Own.<br /><br />True to the book and true to the men who lived and died to defeat true evil.<br />Talk about \\"Heroes\\" - the most overused, misused term in our language... These guys were the real deal.<br /><br />Spielberg and Hanks put together an absolutely top quality series that is worth watching more than once. INMHO, better than Private Ryan or for that matter - any war movie, period. There are some difficult and gruesome things to watch - be warned. But in context - it is appropriate to tell the true story.<br /><br />After seeing it - I had to get the book. Very inspiring.<br /><br />Thanks HBO!

B000EWBKKI|5.0|This is Ahhhhhnuuuulllld in his prime! I picked this up locally not too long ago. Being that this was an older movie I didn't expect much from the blu-ray transfer - at all. I was quite suprised.     When you watch this on blu-ray take into account how old this movie actually is and you will come away with a new appreciation of how well it was filmed originally. The picture is crisp, the colors are really sharp, the contrast is perfect. The sound has obviously been tweaked, not in a \\"WTF that doesn't sound right!\\" fashion but cleaner - what you would expect from blu-ray.     The scene where Sarah is breaking out of the asylum and she breaks a guard's arm - you'll cringe :)    For the price you cannot go wrong with this one! Revisit an absolute classic. With more recent releases being expensive and really not worth the price (it should be cheaper to snag a blu ray than to see it in the theater - my opinion )this is an easy purchase. Even if you have never seen this one and think Ahnuld is cheesey pick this up - you'll understand why we all love a good Ahhhhnuuuuld flick. Really you've got to love this one.     If this isn't in you collection but ANY High School Musical is you don't deserve blu-ray, a tv, eyes, or the $$$ you wasted on it :)
015206396X|5.0|This is a very clever concept and well delivered.  Like the above authors (and others), we have a strong, independent (young) woman working at finding her place or \\"voice\\" in her world.  Exciting action.  A good, but not Disney-esque happily-ever-after, ending.  I highly recommend it.
B000LC55F2|3.0|A decent little film that will keep you entertained, even if you, like I, work out the twist in the first five minutes. It goes off on a completely different tack from Christopher Priest's novel, but in a very interesting way (and to the point that even the author apparently prefers Nolan's vision of the concept to his own). Michael Caine does his usual splendid job of subtly stealing every scene that he's in from the two leads and David Bowie makes a beautifully underplayed cameo appearance as Nikola Tesla.

B001J1O83E|4.0|This is strictly by the numbers, and is as clichéd as all hell, but it's still extremely enjoyable nonetheless. It's also about three different films in one, as it starts off in the vein of paranoiac American \\"Europe is a hotbed of evil and degradation\\" thrillers like Roman Polanski's [[ASIN:6305133476 Frantic]] and Eli Roth's [[ASIN:B000EHRVP6 Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]], then becomes a gritty examination of sex trafficking in Paris, before entering decidedly Bondesque territory for a denouement which sees the protagonist cutting a swathe of destruction through an embassy party wearing a dinner jacket. What raises it above the level of your standard brainless action fare is Liam Neeson's turn as a character who is absolutely relentless, completely unapologetic and refreshingly lacking in political correctness in the way that he goes about tracking down and eradicating the Albanian gangster clichés that have abducted his daughter. I actually turned to the other half towards the end and informed her that early nineties dancemeisters, 'Pop Will Eat Itself' had written the soundtrack for this film in the form of a song entitled \\"Get The Girl And Kill The Bad Guy\\". I loved it because it's exactly the kind of nasty, brutal, unreconstructed, fascistic, old-school revenge fantasy that Hollywood has been promising us for years, but has been too frightened too actually deliver - the awful [[ASIN:B000Y7U97I Death Sentence (Unrated Edition)]] being the most recent catastrophic misfire which comes to mind. By its very nature, the revenge thriller is not a politically correct genre and it's a mistake to try and make it one. 'Taken' is nasty, it's violent, it's actually quite racist when you think about it, and it's also completely enjoyable. Complete tosh, but tosh done correctly for once, and as someone who has grown increasingly sick of seeing action movies watered down for a PG-13 audiences, I say god bless every uncompromising, bone-snapping R-rated minute of it.
B001NY43L4|5.0|First off, not to be a snob, but please ignore the other review for your own sake. Skip Quarantine completely and go straight for the original as there is simply no comparison. Jaume Balageuero's film is a masterpiece of contemporary horror. I don't want to get into the plot too much but suffice to say people are trapped in an apartment building, they don't know why they've been sealed in and amongst them, deranged zombie-like killers are going haywire; this puts all involved in a bit of a sticky wicket. You need to see the rest. REC packs an amazing ride into 70 minutes on a small budget and is proof what can be done with creativity and the power of suggestion. It is not what we see that usually scares us but what we don't and the directors knew that. Finally, the handheld nature of REC isn't annoying, it's crucial to the experience of the film. It places the viewer in the role of the mostly anonymous cameraman and provides a feeling of claustrophobia and that unsettled squirming-in-your-skin sensation that makes good horror films truly a joy to view. Don't see Quarantine. See REC, turn off the lights and enjoy the ride.
0765342294|5.0|I love a world where people are tested young for vocations and set on the right path and this books takes it to a delicious extreme (something Orson Scott Card does very well - so does Isaac Asimov).  This book almost took me to where Anne McCaffrey did in Dragonsong and the Rowan.  If you mixed the two into a cynical mind, you'd get this story.  While Anne McCaffrey is a hopeful author, Orson Scott Card wants to take us to the edges of humanity's willingness to exploit talent it would normally not even recognize.<br /><br />That said, I love this book.  I love that edge and the writing draws you in without drawing attention to itself the way some authors do.  It is an insight to the thinking of a truly exceptional intelligent mind.  Thank you Orson Scott Card.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This just built on the suspense generated by the first series.  This is definately a must see.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Quite simply put, this is the most amazing piece of cinema that I've seen in a while and certainly the most plausible vision of a future Anglican dystopia yet committed to film. It's an instant addition to my favourite films of all time. Its difficult to do the experience of watching it justice in words - if you can imagine a more humane Kubrick or perhaps Andrei Tarkovsky or Elem Klimov working within the perimeters (but not conventions) of the British/American film-making lexicon, then you're getting close. It takes a thousand images from the contemporary world that you're familiar with and weaves them into a tapestry of such alarmingly plausible disquiet that you can't help but be drawn in. If you're a fan of film-making you can consider it a 'must-own' for the simple reason that it contains two of the most hauntingly evocative scenes ever committed to celluloid - one is an attack on a car full of people on an open road, the other is a pitched battle that grinds to a halt in order to provide safe passage for innocents caught in the crossfire. Stunning stuff. We need more films like it.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|From the fake trailors to the bridge explosion, this movie had me laughing until my belly hurt. This is a great movie with excellent acting, specifically Robert Downey Junior.

B00005JPUN|1.0|If you want a primer on how not to make a 'Body Snatchers' movie, go and rent 'The Invasion'  right now. Knowing something of the film's troubled production - the original cut delivered to the studio by [[ASIN:B0009RCPUC Downfall]] alumnus Oliver Hirschbiegel was considered to be 'too arthouse' by producer Joel Silver and consequently two thirds of the film was reshot by those purveyors of crimes against cinema, the Wachowski Brothers - left me wanting to see Hirschbiegel's original cut in order to see what was considered so cinematically reprehensible that it had to be reconfigured into a load of sub-action toss by two siblings, who, if there were any justice in the universe, would never be let near a film camera again. Frustratingly, it did have some intriguing ideas in it. The news reports showing vistas of the world succumbing to the REM pods - Chavez and Bush signing a peace accord, US troops pulling out of Iraq and handing over control to Moqtadr Al Sadr - showed the tantalising promise of a much more interesting exploration of the concept of a post-pod planet.  For the most part though, and as I observed to the other half while watching it, \\"this is everything that's wrong with modern American cinema\\", which is a pity because its in complete contrast to Philip Kaufman's definitive 1978 version of the tale, [[ASIN:B000QQJ3Q0 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition)]], which is everything that's right about modern American cinema and still one of the most chilling films that I've ever seen.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|Here's a video of the May 2005 London reunion show at the Royal Albert Hall (nothing from the October 2005 New York show, here or anywhere else). The band is looking... old. The sound is... not loud. The guys play and play and play, its just the music, pure, stripped-down music, but there's nothing here that is mind-blowing - it's mainly for fans. The packaging is a bit deceptive - I bought it thinking that it was something from the band's original run in the 1960s, not noticing the 2005 hidden in the psychedelics on the cover art. There is no description on the back, just a song list. So, the first time I watched it, I didn't get half way through before I gave up, wrote an angry review that I posted on Amazon (that got quite a bit of negative feedback) and left it at that. When I was in the library the other day and came across a DVD of the original farewell concert, I thought it was time to revisit this and watch the two shows back to back.<br />The concert starts off with a walk backstage. The band is not wearing hippy clothes or costumes, just simple shirts and jeans. Seated audience, trippy background colours. Quiet mix. Weird shot of Ginger's stockinged feet at the drum kit (see pics below). Hot middle-aged women in the front row (ditto). Two red roses at Jack's feet. Eric buffoonishly announces \\"we'll play everything - we might talk to you from time to time.\\" They do neither. Topless girl on somebody's shoulders in audience replicating Woodstock (probably just briefly before she was thrown out). Long, dramatic pause in the middle of \\"Badge\\" - which they'd never performed live before, since it was on their Goodbye album that came out after the final show. They'd also never done \\"Pressed Rat And Warthog\\". Jack Bruce takes a load off and leans against a stool. \\"Sweet Wine's\\" Ba-ba... Ba-ba-ba-ba-... ba-ba-ba-BA-ba-ba-baaaaaa\\" is a bit silly for sixty-something musicians to be playing. Somehow, the band dynamic is one thing, but the audience dynamic is another, and we get lots of shots of the crowd (or at least the people in the front row - see photos below). In \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" we see two Asian couples in the audience, one a short haired (Hong Kong) yuppie couple, and another a long-haired hippy (Japanese?) couple, the man with a mustachio. Another fan holds up his copy of the Disraeli Gears LP. At the end of the show, the audience is standing, big long very wanky drum solo. Mainly guys in the audience. Some pre-encore backstage shots. Close-ups on six hands of the three musicians playing in harmony.<br /><br />The interviews are revealing, silly and funny. \\"We don't do the leaping about crap. It's the music, not anybody gyrating onstage.\\" Ginger explained that Cream was not a rock band, two of them are jazz men and Eric is a blues man, and blues is the same as jazz. \\"We have the gift of time, which not many have.\\" Eric noted that they often forgot their cues, they were young and took risks and were experimental, they didn't know what they were doing, but they somehow found their way spontaneously at The Albert Hall. Gingers also adds that \\"The others get nerves, always have been. I never do. The more people the better, I like it. People help you play. They really do.\\"e get lots of shots of the crowd (or at least the people in the front row - see photos below).

B001GZ6QDS|2.0|I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I didn't like THE DARK KNIGHT.  In fact, after watching it a second time, I gave my DVDs of both this film and BATMAN BEGINS to my son.<br /><br />Why didn't I like it?<br /><br />(1) The movie looks great, but it is also too long.  I was checking my watch after the first 40 minutes.  I think we could have easily done without The Joker's final caper.<br /><br />(2) There are so many plot threads that many of are not well developed.<br /><br />(3) With the exception of the opening bank robbery sequence, the action sequences may be flashy, but they are also over-extended to the point where they become tiring.<br /><br />(4) Christian Bale may be a fine actor, but as Bruce Wayne/Batman he is so dour that he's dull.  I kept waiting for the movie to cut back to The Joker.<br /><br />(5) When I was watching the film in the theater, like everybody else, I was very impressed with Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker.  However, watching the picture a second time on DVD, I was less taken with his performance.  This time, I could see \\"the actor\\" at work.  [I'm writing this on the night before the Oscars.  I'm sure he'll win.]<br /><br />In all fairness, I must admit that I am not a big fan of superhero movies.  They're just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />So, why did I review this one?<br /><br />Because Amazon keeps putting a \\"Review Request\\" for the DVD on my page, so I figured that this was a good way to get rid of it.<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />© Michael B.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|- In the 56 years since the release of the original [[ASIN:B000FA4TLQ Gojira / Godzilla Deluxe Collector's Edition (Gojira/Godzilla [1954] / Godzilla, King of the Monsters [1956])]] , the intent, themes and protagonist of that film have been changed, redefined and remodelled so many times to the point that it now exists in the Western zeitgeist as an amusing pop cultural shorthand for bad special effects and ridiculous plots. The unadulterated Japanese cut of the film, which has only been released in the west relatively recently, is a stark warning against the misuse of Atomic energy released in a country that less than a decade before had suffered its defining moment of the twentieth century at the hands of the Atom bomb. At the time of its release, the first generation of 'Hibakusha'  were still suffering the direct effects of the atrocities committed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the scenes of municipal halls crammed to capacity with people suffering radiation sickness, the wholesale destruction of Tokyo, and the unforgettable scene of a nation mourning its loss through a choral radio broadcast would've struck a deeply horrific, resonant chord with the Japanese audience of its time. Time and the Toho company's lucrative franchise have almost completely eroded the original power and intent of the film from history and replaced it with a farrago of sequels featuring increasingly outlandish monsters duking it out in badly realised model cities. Considering this, I'd argue that 'Cloverfield'  is probably the only true spiritual sequel to Ishiro Honda's film ever made in that it uses more or less the same concept to similarly examine a defining moment of national history and evoke the horrors of a collective international tragedy and its aftermath. In this case, that moment is the 911 attacks and the nation is America and, by association and the proliferation of more technologically advanced broadcast technologies, the world. 911 haunts every frame of the film. Whenone observes the shaky hand-held vistas of ash-covered New Yorkers hiding in grocery stores to avoid the billowing detritus of falling buildings, one can't help but relate it to the footage captured by the French film-makers, the Naudet bros. in the haunting documentary, [[ASIN:B00006B1HI 9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition]]. There have been a lot of questions asked around the subject of whether it was tasteful or indeed right to frame a \\"monster movie\\" in a verite style which mimics video footage of a national tragedy. To those people I would say, \\"you're missing the point\\". While nominally a monster movie in appearance, 'Cloverfield' is really no more about a giant undersea arthropod than 'Gojira' was about a giant lizard; both are merely cyphers for forces in our daily lives which could run out of control and devastate our world and both are filmed in a style which is evocative and relevant to the audiences of their time. The creatures of both stories are barely seen - a stylistic choice which suggests that one should not attach too much importance to the cause but rather the effects. The reasons behind the destruction in Cloverfield remain nebulous and unresolved and as the final haunting frames of the film draw to the close, it is ultimately the human cost of the destruction that the audience is left to consider rather than the origins of its agent.

1592403913|4.0|I had this book on my wish-list for quite some time.  I was delighted to see and buy the illustrated version at a `remainder` price of only $4.95.  The illustrations are cute, but I do not think that they warrant any substantially increased price over that of the regular version.  I do not feel that the illustrations help very much in getting the ideas across, but neither are they an impediment.  The book is nicely hardbound; the illustrations are cute and it would make a nice gift, but be forewarned; it is in effect smaller than the 176 pages that it takes up.  There is a one and a half space between each line of text, so subtracting the illustrations (some of which are full-page) and you have a book whose text is actually less than 100 pages in length.<br /><br />There are over 500 reviews of the regular version, so there is little new that I can say.  I base my 4-star rating on the text and on the fact that the illustrations do not add enough to the book to warrant the extra cost that including them entails. I think that the book would have been greatly improved had there been a brief summary (as little as a paragraph) of the material covered in each chapter.  Better yet, a concise summary at the end of the book would act as a great review.  As it is, one has to wade through a lot of semi-amusing text to get to the heart of the matter.  I sometimes got the impression that the author was more interested in being cute and addressed the material to those who, like her, are horrified at the lack of punctuation skills of the rest of us, rather than in doing her utmost to help the rest of us to improve those skills.  (Don't get me wrong, I got quite a bit from this book and still recommend it, even though the author gets a bit snide at times.)  I also think that the book is a bit `thin` and over-priced, even at the reduced Amazon price, let alone for the list price of $25.<br /><br />I have always found it strange that I could get through graduate school, have successfully learned advanced calculus, thermodynamics and the rudiments of quantum mechanics, yet find punctuation somewhat of a mystery.  This book has helped clear up some of that mystery.  It does so in a delightful manner, one geared to adults rather than grade-schoolers.  Somehow, like most people, I did not absorb this material in grade school, so some remedial education is clearly needed, and this book provides it.  Now I hope that I can remember to apply what I have learned.dvanced calculus, thermodynamics and the rudiments of quantum mechanics, yet find punctuation somewhat of a mystery.  This book has helped clear up some of that mystery.  It does so in a delightful manner, one geared to adults rather than grade-schoolers.  Somehow, like most people, I did not absorb this material in grade school, so some remedial education is clearly needed, and this book provides it.  Now I hope that I can remember to apply what I have learned.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|As a standalone last-man-on-earth movie or a remake of [[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]] , 'I Am Legend' is a film of two halves. The first half, I was pleasantly surprised to discover, is very good indeed and doesn't concede to the big guns, explosions and one-liner forumula popularised by the Bruckheimer and Simpson school of Blockbuster movie-making; In keeping with the novel, what you have is the laconic introduction of a man going about an ordered routine in a world in which order has ceased to have meaning. The first section of the film, prior to the first appearance of the living human infected (and minus some dodgy CGI deer and a CGI lion that looked like it had padded into frame from the film, [[ASIN:B00005JNX0 Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)]] ) is nothing short of breathtaking. The vistas of an empty New York slowly returning to nature are the best CGI that I've seen since [[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)]] largely because, bar the opening shots, they borrow a trick from that film in not dwelling on the landscapes with the obligatory \\"look at our cool effects, kids!\\" shots. Because of the ordinariness with which they're treated one doesn't relate to them as an effect.  Smith's performance as Bob Neville is, thank the lord, note perfect. The unspoken dread in his eyes as he's washing his canine companion in the bath-tub and waiting for the sun to set is palpable and, I take my hat off to him, he deserves an Oscar for the strength and subtlety of his performance here. Films like this are carried by their actors and this is a spectacular performance. Not the best of its kind - that accolade still goes to the late, great Bruno Lawrence in the brilliant [[ASIN:B000EZ908Y The Quiet Earth]]  - but certainly in the top five. However, the scene which is the film's greatest triumph is also its greatest tragedy. Namely, when Neville is forced to chase his dog into a darkened building and we're treated to a bravura sequence in which he unequivocally panics as he tracks around darkened corners with his rifle. We, the audience, know that the human infected - whom we still haven't seen - are going to jump out on him. And they do. And when they do, they are unfortunately completely unconvincing as anything other than a special effect - and not a particularly convincing special effect at that - at which that point all of the carefully accrued tension dissipates and the audience finds itself firmly in rubbery Matrix CGI country. Make no mistake about it, if Francis Lawrence had opted for human performers in make-up (of the like seen in [[ASIN:B000TJBN80 28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)]]  and Zack Snyder's superb [[ASIN:B0002ABURA Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)]] remake) rather than CGI, it would have probably have been the most terrifying piece of big-budget horror film-making in recent history. In fact, one wonders whether the budget wasn't the deciding factor in making the human infected CGI, as the audiences awareness of them as a special effect drastically reduces the level of horror which would probably have garnered the film an R17/18 rating; something which would have prevented vast swathes of the audience demographic from seeing it and probably would have spelled box office doom given the millions involved. From then on, the film marches steadily on to a denouement which is hurried, rather limp and a complete juxtaposition to the dark themes of the novel. If you're a fan of the novel, you're not going to see it here. The only resemblance to it is the title, the name of the protagonist and, superficially, the situation. Neville is no longer a borderline-alcoholic, blue-collared schmoe barely managing to contain his own self-destructive urges. The scientific examination of the vampire myth that made the book so fascinating is not here. Neither is the final heart-breaking inversion of Neville's plight which so haunted me when I read it as a thirteen year old. Suffice to say, despite three official screen interpretations and numerous unofficial interpretations, the definitive version of this massively influential novel is still to be made. One day, maybe Hollywood will realise that this is one story that doesn't need a rewrite or eye-candy to bolster what is already a supremely haunting and still frighteningly relevant tale.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Wow.  Metallica's needed to put out something like this for a while now.     Metallica was best known for their work in the 80's, where they co-produced some of their best albums with Flemming Rasmussen.  However, after the band put out ...And Justice For All, the band decided they wanted to go in a different direction for the next album and for about the next 13 or 14 years, the band was produced by Bob Rock.  There wouldn't have been much wrong with that except Bob Rock always seemed to view Metallica as a prog-rock group as opposed to the metal juggernauts they were.  The end result was one album that was commercially successful, but three subsequent studio albums that either left their fanbase divided or left their metal fans feeling alienated and disinterested.    Maybe it was the response from St. Anger, maybe it was getting Rob Trujillo in the band, maybe it was seeing what they've become in Some Kind Of Monster.  At some point, the band decided they had enough with their direction and decided to change directions to save themselves and their career.  The band brought in Rick Rubin and, using his knowledge and tutelage, directed Metallica back to where they came from.  The result is this album.    So what will you get from this album?  An overwhelming amount of overdriven hard rock/heavy metal songs that have that sound Metallica's refined over the years.  James still wails the lyrics out as he's always done, he and Kirk still nail the solos Dave Mustaine loves to hate, and Lars alternates from the ...AJFA rock beats to the early Metallica D-Beats while throwing in a sufficient amount of double bass when needed; giving Metallica the groove that's carried them from underground to mainstream while maintaining metal credibility.    The difference? Well, Rob Trujillo makes this album sweet as all get out because his playing style is a perfect compliment to the band.  Also, this is the first Metallica album I've remembered in some time that's had a good portion ofharmonized melodies.  Put it together and you get everything you've come to expect from a traditional Metallica album plus a few surprises.      I liked all the tracks on this album.  My favorites were \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", \\"Cyanide\\", \\"The Judas Kiss\\", and the instrumental \\"Suicide and Redemption\\".  I liked \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" the best because not only was it instrumental, but it sounded they broke into Rick Rubin's stash, listed to some Kyuss, Black Sabbath, and Pelican (!!!) records, and jammed afterward.      For all you diehard Metallica fans, you probably own this album already.  For all of you alienated fans or those thinking \\"is it really them?\\"... yes, they have returned to familiar form, so feel free to get this album.  There's a lot to like about this album and if someone's gonna hate on it, then frankly they're only hating on it because they've either got nothing better to do, are embarrassed to admit Metallica's good again, or are still stuck in that herd mentality that Metallica should be despised forever for releasing Load, Reload, and potentially St. Anger depending on whether or not you get \\"scene points\\" for liking St. Anger.      This is the best Metallica album released in a while.  I recommend everyone check it out.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|In a word, \\"Frustrating\\"; as a film, it looks fantastic and in places it matches the surreal horror of the game perfectly (the introduction of the bile spewing walkers and the apocalyptic vistas of the ash enshrouded town on the edge of hell are highpoints) but it falls down due to a hackneyed script from Tarantino alumnus, Roger Avary, which eschews the ambiguity of the games in favour of your standard, over-the-top Hollywood histrionics. For instance, where the motivations of the protagonists that you guide in the games are often nebulous and opaque, here we're saddled with a stock 'loving mother who must *yawn* traverse the gates of hell in order to rescue her terminally ill daughter' character motivation from the outset, as well as plot points and themes that are not so much insinuated as sledge-hammered home to the point where you get the impression that the script may actually have been written by Phil Hartman's Frankenstein (Religion BAD! Mummy GOOD!). As a film, it also needed to be about 45 minutes shorter and not so obviously set up for a sequel. That said, Akira Yamaoka's atonal electronic soundtrack sounds splendid in a digital mix, Laurie Holden in a tight motorcycle cop uniform does wonders for the ardour and at least we should be grateful that Uwe Boll didn't get his hands on this one.  All in all, a missed opportunity.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Overall this was a good CD. It reminded me of master of puppets at some parts. There are only 2 major complaints i have about this cd. One is that all the songs sound very similar. There isn't enough variety on this cd. The solos and riffs all sound the same. Second, these songs are way too long. Each song is like over 6 minutes at the very least. I remember one song even being 10 minutes. Talk about overkill. There were so many times in that song where they could have ended it. Basically it got annoying because the songs just kept going with no real structure or purpose. An average cd, so 3 stars.
0765316897|5.0|Sanderson has shown that his mastery of character growth and depth is excellent.  This book reveals some extremely pleasing surprises that also shows he has a lot of foresight.  The surprises demonstrate that from book one he had already thought out very carefully some plot twists.  And some of these twists are very detailed oriented from the very first book and they make you trace back the entire story you read to make sure that indeed his story written 3 years ago in 2006, matches up with what he's revealing in 2009.  Extremely impressed with his writing.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|[[ASIN:B001P5HI4A Yentl (Two-Disc Directors Cut)]]    I have had the movie \\"Yentl\\" on my email alert list for at least 3 years. Finally it has been released on DVD and it was well worth the wait. We greatly enjoyed the movie when we saw it on TV years ago and are proud to have it added to our movie library. It is excellent on all levels.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  The cinematography and story-telling is amazing, but even better is the message... these men made huge sacrifices, and answered a call to defeat a great evil in their generation.  They struggled and saw so many things that should not have to be- I am thankful for their service and sacrifice and only hope my generation can do greater things in the name of freedom and with honor.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|This DVD has over 30 songs on it and extremely good sound quality.  All of their hit songs are on this DVD.  The quality of their performance is on par with R30 and very impressive.  This is definitely the concert DVD I would recommend out of the ones Rush has released.
055358894X|3.0|This book has a great story and concept but its biggest weakness is its character depth.  And this to me made all the difference in the world.  If Lynch was able to bring the characters more alive I would have given this book 5 stars.  It's got every other aspect to make it such a good book but the lack of feelings for the character is overwhelming.  E.G. Lynch isn't afraid of killing off characters which is excellent-no writer should be afraid of this.  But he'd kill a character and I'd just shrug because I never really felt a whole lot for the character to begin with.  And he even kills off major characters so you'd think this would be even more significant.  But it wasn't any different from when a minor character died to the major ones.
0345495004|2.0|I just couldn't muster up any empathy for the main character of this one. The main character being Frank Lloyd Wright's mistress. She left her children and husband to run off with him and I just couldn't get past that huge flaw in her character. OK, lets be real, her husband maybe I could've forgiver her for, but her kids, I just couldn't relate. I made it at least half way through the book, did not find it interesting and finally put it down. So maybe I am not the best reviewer for this one.
B000UBMSB8|3.0|First of all I seen this movie for the first time in 1982 when it aired on HBO. Of course it was the version with Deckerd's voice over. I loved it for it's original  style of music, sets, characters and mood. Then in 1992 they released the Directors cut and I was excited about seeing it. I was hoping for scenes of Roy Batty's life on off world, like what he described to Deckard at the end of the film. Or more story on Deckard's past, which would of help telling if Deckard is a replicant or not. What we got was a scene of a unicorn an the voice over eliminated. I again enjoyed this version of the film to but like I said I was hoping for more. Then in 2007, they released this 4 version set with plenty of behind the scenes goodies. I just purchased this set about a week ago and I am glad I bought it for less than half of the original price. Once again I was hoping to see more never before seen scenes, especially since there was a version called the final cut included..If you count less than a minute of scene variance difference between the U.S. version, the U.K. version and the directors cut worthy of seeing it 4 times. The minor changes on these three versions were so insignificant, they made no change in the story or mood of the film.  I watched the extras and what surprised me was, several times they mentioned this film was almost 4 hours long before the editing was done. You would think with an extra 2 hours of film that was not used they could have given us an almost complete new version of this movie. I was impressed with the cleanup of the films making for better picture and sound than the first release of them years ago. This movie, set new standards in movie making with dark sets and music that set the mood of the story telling. It was not widely accepted in 82, but over the years with the help of video tape and then dvd it found cult status. I just hope one day soon they decide to use the unused footage to give us a truly alternate version to the 82 release.Five stars plus for the movie itself, but three stars to Warner Brothers idea of selling 4 versions, with three of them with extremely little difference.
B000026I8U|2.0|I really enjoyed his live album (Radio Bemba Sound System) and was hoping to enjoy the studio version of some of the songs off that album.  Sad to say I couldn't even listen to the entire album.  The recording quality was so poor it became annoying.    I get the impression he is a great live act, but studio-wise it's difficult to emulate the same energy. Perhaps his later albums are better, but I'm afraid not game to risk any more purchases based on my experience with this album.  I guess I'm just not that much of a fan.
0756404746|3.0|I think I was expecting too much from this book from all the reviews I read.  Book is good overall and there are parts of the book that are absolutely captivitating.  But overall, I wasn't too impressed with the story.  But the book has set a good premise to develop into a much better series.  I will be reading the 2nd book to see where Rothfuss takes the series.  So a good read, not a great one but with potential to be better.

B000TGJ8AS|4.0|Season 4 starts with Ziva being framed for murder, and of course only one person can save her GIBBS!!! Naturally Gibbs comes out of retirement to help an old friend, but don't be fooled. The last thing he wants is his badge back. Although eventually the Director does convince Gibbs to return to NCIS. But lets face it folks, we all knew it was gonna happen. Surprisingly not everyone on the team is happy to see Gibbs back. Speaking of team, we have a brand new probey, Lee who seems very timid until the episode she goes undercover.<br /><br />Now what I've noticed with all the seasons of NCIS is that there is always an underlined theme to the season. Last season was the \\"season of change\\" with the death of Kate, and the introduction of a new team member(Ziva) and a new Director(Jenny). This season for me was the \\"season of Growth\\". This season showed a lot of character development for the majority of the cast, love, as well as loss. Somehow while all the drama with our beloved NCIS special agents was going on, they actually managed to solve crimes.
B00004RFFS|4.0|The movie arrived on time and I received one of those paper version that for some reason is better for me, it includes more printed material and the texture is better than the regular plastic case of a DVD
0307454894|5.0|Barely a week ago I saw the movie of The Reader.  As the child of Holocaust survivors, I make it a point to read what is written on the subject and to see films and TV programs that address it.  I was more than disappointed in the film -- I was troubled by the mixed messages it seemed to send about individual German's culpability in the horrow of the Holocaust.  The film seemed to be saying that Hanna, the central character in the film, had a secret -- that she was illiterate -- that was somehow more shameful to her than her actions as a concentration camp guard and that somehow this was understandable.  I think the mere fact that Hanna is played by Kate Winslet, who is such a powerful screen presence, causes this almost sympathetic reaction.  I felt the audience was being invited to pity her, and this bothered me immensely.  I had some interesting discussions with friends about the film, many of whom disagreed with my point of view.    I decided I needed to know more and chose to read the novel.  What a revelation.  The novel is everything the film is not.  I was immediately drawn into the spare, unadorned prose, entirely depicting Michael's first-person memories and questioning thoughts,and which moved along at a furious pace that kept me glued to the page (or screen, as I was reading on the Kindle).  In the novel, Michael grapples with big questions of love and dependency, guilt and obligation,knowledge and denial, forgiveness and absolution.      The novel makes clear that the love story between Michael and Hanna is really a metaphor for the effort of the post-war generation in Germany to grapple with the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich and the role that their parent's generation played in those horrors.  Should the younger generation try to understand their elders?  Should they stop loving those that are revealed to have been complicit?  Are they obligated to make amends to the victims?  Should they forgive? Should they continue to assume the guilt of their parents? Should they forget or remember?  None of these are easy questions, and they are certainly not resolved in the novel.  But through Michael's unflinching telling of his story, we are given glimpses into how a generation must have felt to have to deal with knowledge so painful and to wonder if what they would have done.       Those who gave the book one star reviews and complained about lack of character development and too many unanswered questions posed by the narrator are missing the point of the novel.  These are first-person memories designed to help the person sharing them come to terms with his past and who he is.  It is about healing yourself.  In that it is akin to a memoir, not  a character study.  If you're looking for historic explanation and poetic descriptions of people, places, and events, this is not the book for you.  If you want an honest exploration of what it means to look evil in the face and come to some sort of understanding of your role in abetting it or exonerating it, you will be enriched by reading \\"The Reader.\\"
B00129H7VS|5.0|The series is great! but the blu-ray version is makes it simply phenomenal A must own for lovers of great movies,I watched it on a 61\\" hd full 5.1 surround sound tuned way up and many times I got chills from the feeling of immersion of being there in the middle of the action. buy Blu-ray now if you already don't own it,this is one of those movies that regular dvd's do it no justice.
B000001DQG|4.0|Okay, first off, have to dispel a few myths. One: Elton and Bernie weren't burned out when they set out to put together what would become \\"Caribou\\" (its working title was \\"Old Pink Eyes Is Back,\\" a nod to Sinatra). And \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" by the way, wasn't written in a weekend ... it was done largely either before, during and after the ill-fated attempt to record in Jamaica. Much of the records was done in the studio in France during the week or two he and the band were there. Back to \\"Caribou,\\" though, which wasn't done in a MONTH - God, don't we wish! Elton would only dedicate that much time to \\"Captain Fantastic.\\"  \\"Caribou\\" was written during a nine-day break between legs of his world tour. Elton and Bernie were still on fire at this point, and if anything the only thing this record doesn't have is a sort of through-line to tie it all together. Then again, how do you follow \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road?\\" If you're Elton, Bernie and the band, you don't.  The album's a bit of a hodgepodge, but Gus kept it all together and even if it didn't come out quite as intended, many of the tracks hold up well, even today. Oh, sure there are a couple of clinkers (\\"Stinker\\") and a few head scratching moments (\\"Solar Prestige A Gammon\\"), but overall you have to love how unassuming and playful it is. Some of it's even downright movingly beautiful (\\"Ticking,\\" \\"Pinky\\"). Even \\"Dixie Lily\\" has made a bit of comeback in concert in recent years, one of those great Elton album gems that's never been far from the fans' memories.  \\"The Bitch Is Back,\\" \\"You're So Static\\" and \\"I've Seen The Saucers\\" are all good fun in their own way, and the big single, \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" has joined \\"Bitch\\" as a beloved concert staple.  Gus' remastering and the bonus tracks included make it a great listen all around. Grab one and just take it for what it is ... just Elton being Elton.

The age old struggle to find love and hold on to hope in the midst of the poverty of India's slums will captivate your imagination.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|My goodness, this was a pleasant surprise! I'll definitely be getting more seasons. This show is a constant source of belly laughs. It lures you in with standard yet engaging plot lines and then blind sides you with crazy funny jokes out of no where! Neil Patrick Harris is in his prime and steals the show entirely. By the second episode I didn't even mind the laugh track. I suggest if you enjoy silly and sometimes heartfelt entertainment, give How I Met Your Mother a shot.
1592402690|5.0|I was 10 years old when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan in 1964. I was smitten by their music. As an adult I studied and became a recording engineer. Geoff Emerick's account of the creation of some of the best music of my time is nothing short of being there! You get a firsthand account of not only how the most amazing songs of the 20th century were created and recorded, but the attitudes, temperament and genius that were present in the studio. Anyone who has even a minimal interest in music and recording can see the creativity by Mr. Emerick, George Martin their producer and the Beatles themselves. I felt I was there in the studio like a fly on the wall.
B000W00Y0Y|3.0|While admittedly live performances are just that, live, I still dislike it when the lead singer feels the need to vary from the original recording.  What I hear first is what I think it should always be and Freddie Mercury chose to accessorize the songs and the differences were annoying to me, but that is just me.  If you aren't that familiar with the songs you won't notice any problems.

The way times are broken, melodies intersected and progressions constructed it's inevitable to think genius when the songs occur.    For metal fans, if you don't like this album, you shouldn't call yourself a Metal fan.

For example, in the scene when Jason comes back from the train station and gets in the car and starts yelling at Marie right before he tells her \\"Last chance Marie...\\". On the Blu-ray.com forum lots of people have had the same issue.

B0011HF6GE|4.0|It is exactly one year since Bon Iver's debut album was released, and the phenomenon keeps growing. I read recently somewhere that this album now has sold over 125,000 copies, an astonishing number for this type of indie music release.<br /><br />\\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" (9 tracks; 37 min.) is strictly an acoustic and solo recording from Justin Vernon. I love the opener \\"Flume\\", with Justin's soaring, almost angelic, overdubbed vocals. You can also feel the emotions pore out in every track. For example on \\"Flume\\", the first two lines are \\"I am my mother's only one/It's enough\\", which hit right at you. Not much up-tempo melodies on this record, although \\"Blindsided\\" comes close. Not that it matters. This is an intimate listening experience (and as with all quite records, should be played LOUD). My favorite tracks are in the second half of the album: \\"Creature Fear\\" with the \\"Team\\" instrumental outro as a separate track, which in turn is followed by \\"For Emma\\", which is the most traditional/conventional song on the album.<br /><br />This album has gotten massive critical and (by indie-release standards) commercial acclaim. Bon Iver just released the \\"Blood Bank\\" EP, as well as 2 new tracks on the \\"Dark Was the Night\\" indie-charity compilation. I will finally have the chance to see Bon Iver in concert in June at Bonnaroo, and I really have no idea what to expect, but it's certainly one of my more anticipated shows for this year. And if you wonder where you can hear this type of music, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none.
0679805273|4.0|One of my favorite books sinc emy high school teacher read it to my class.
0143038419|3.0|I am coming up on the final pages of EAT PRAY LOVE and am almost sad that it is coming to an end. The book follows the travels of the author in search of meaning in her life. Though there are many things I didn't particularly care for in her story, I did enjoy how she writes and the thought processes she has. I also loved the different personalities on her journey.    It starts with the author calling out to God, a call she had never done before. Her call comes at a time when she is thoroughly discontent with her marriage and searching for relevance. I find myself waiting for the author to help me see why she is so displeased with the state of the marriage. She never explains it except that he wants children and she doesn't. What you will find, as you continue the read is how self-centered the author is and you almost desire a better reason for the author to send her life into upheaval with the extra marital affair and divorce.    The characters that she introduces in the different parts of her journey is what is most endearing! Richard from Texas becomes the voice of conscience in the authors head. The plumber/poet from New Zealand gave the author wonderful advice on INSTRUCTIONS FOR FREEDOM. Ketut Liyer is the absent-minded shaman/healer. These sets of different characters makes this read like a novel and pulled me closer into the story.    This book is a memoir so, naturally, it documents the many different epiphanies the author has. I find myself having the epiphanies with her. I loved that the most in the book! It has the possibility of reading like a self-help book, without being condescending because the other \\"goes there\\" with you! I also enjoyed the different discoveries on culture, history and practice that she inserted into the pages.     Overall, I thought the book was an alright read. I am saddened that the book must end because I have become so attached to the journey! However, the book does leave a sour taste in my mouth because the author was paid PRIOR to her travels. It's like an extended magazine article, complete with a story line that must be followed. Travel memoirs usually get a book deal AFTER they've traveled and experienced the journey.     Enjoy!
B0000CF30C|5.0|This SACD does not blow me away like some others, but it definitely sounds better than other versions and is worth owning - especially before it goes OOP like other SACD's.  I was surprised at how musical and engaging this music is, and that includes the songs that were not mega hits.
0810993139|5.0|My 10 year old twins loved this book. In fact, they re-read it all the time.  The main character finds himself in unfortunate situations all the time that are, fortunately for us, very funny. Greg, the main character, points out that this book is really a journal rather than a diary.  It is highly recommended for children 8-13.
B0000AYL16|5.0|This is the best sounding rock/pop SACD I have yet heard.  I was most impressed with the Elton John collection on SACD until I heard this.  I bought the vinyl LP when I was a teen and was unimpressed with the sound and did not care for many of the songs.  Then I got the remastered CD - was still unimpressed.  I was skeptical about paying more for this OOP SACD, but it is the holy grail if your system can take full advantage of this format.  It is truly like hearing a different album - I love every song now.  Even in 2-channel it is like being there.  As of this review, you can still get this set at a good price on elusive disc.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Raiders and Last Crusade it isn't, but Crystal Skull is at least better than the gross-me-out-Aztec-style bloodfest that is Temple of Doom, and if you don't get your hopes up too high or take it too seriously, it's fine Indiana Jones fodder. This movie has grown on me since I saw it in the theater. Yes, it could have and should have been better, but I enjoyed the humorous nods to the previous movies, I wanted closure between Indy and Marion, it was kind of interesting to find out what Jones has been doing in the intervening years, Shia is cute, and if you watch this movie with the mindset of a kid seeing Indiana Jones for the first time, it is a satisfying experience.      It's definitely a little more Sci-Fi than the previous ones, but the Indiana Jones movies are classified as Sci Fi, and if you know anything about 1950s genre movies (and the movie is set in the 1950's), wacky alternative historical theories (like astronauts in Mayan glyphs), you remember the Cold War, Atom Bomb fears, and McCarthyism, (and you enjoy sight gags with furry little animals), then alot of the action and plot-line makes sense and is just plain fun.     By the way, my children actually preferred the audio-book to the movie, as the book tells the story better than the movie does.
0375826726|5.0|this was the best book i have ever read. I could not put it down. The only bad thing about this book is that the next one is not out yet. Awsome read.

Great movie. Just watdch it.
B000F8O35U|1.0|This movie is awful. I loved it when I was a kid, but now I see how bad it really is. Ariel is annoying, and an airhead. Just like everyone else has said, I find it ridiculous how she gave up everything just to be with a guy she saw from a distance. And Eric didn't know anything about her. He just saw a mute girl with a pretty face and just all of a sudden fell in love with her? Ridiculous. And I find how obsessed she is with Eric to be annoying and creepy. She was flirting with a statue of him for goodness sakes! Do yourself a favor and do not buy this movie for your daughters to be messed up like Ariel and make them feel they have to give up everything for a man. And FYI, in the Hans Christian Anderson story, she goes through excrutiating pain and risks her life just to be with the Prince. And in the end turns into sea foam b/c he does not marry her and she can't bring herself to kill him. What a \\"romantic\\" story.
1439102813|5.0|I was thrilled when I received a review copy of Still Alice by Lisa Genova from Simon & Schuster....so many of my friends have been raving about this debut book: a heartbreaking account of a brilliant 51 year old woman stricken with early onset Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />I did not want to put this book down as I was immediately drawn into the story of Alice Howland. Alice is a Harvard Professor at the height of her career, a wife, and a mother of three adult children. The signs were gradual and initially attributed to stress, her hectic life, and menopause. It began with sporadic incidents: brief memory lapses, forgetting names of things or misplacing items, but when she gets lost in her own town she begins to believe it may be something more serious like a brain tumor. When she sees a medical professional and undergoes some testing, the diagnosis shocks Alice and everyone in he life. Even more heartbreaking is the fact that there is no cure, but only various pills and vitamins that could slow the diseases progression. From her diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease to her sad downward spiral, the reader feels every emotion as if they were Alice.<br /><br />At one point Alice says she wishes she was told she has cancer, for at least she could fight that with chemo and radiation. She added that even if cancer is not cured, you get a chance to say goodbye to your loved ones. Sadly with Alzheimers you don't get a chance to say goodbye at the end, because is ravishes your mind and you are unable to recognize loved ones at the end.<br /><br />The character of Alice is unforgettable and the story is so powerful. Although it might be a tough subject for some people to read about, it is certainly one that deserves widespread attention. This book is not be be missed. A touching, unforgettable novel that reads like a memoir.

B000FS9MV0|4.0|Almost four years ago, I had the honor of listening to Renee during her first appearance at the Blue Note in New York.  I was also honored to meet her.  Along with many others, I have waited impatiently for this album to be released.  With the title of \\"Skylark\\", I was hoping for an organic album of standards.  But unfortunately, this hodge-podge of an collection mixes computer enhanced standards with some new soft, adult pop.  What I wouldn't give for a set with Renee and a rhythm section doing appropriate standards and jazz oriented originals!  But that recording would never sell the way David Foster's technically advanced recordings sell!  On the plus side, Renee swings through \\"Ain't We Got Fun\\", \\"Hit the Road, Jack\\", and \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\".  (I could do without the special effects on \\"Alabama\\".)  \\"Thanks for the Boogie Ride\\" is a joy, with Renee fronting a big band.  \\"When I Fall in Love\\" and \\"Skylark\\" show Renee at her soulful best on ballads.  I only wonder why she would record \\"Lover Man\\" and \\"You Go to My Head\\".  She is still a bit too young for these songs.  Age inapproprate material also appeared on her first CD.  I also wish the arrangement on \\"My Baby Just Cares for Me\\" was more original and less Nina Simone.  However, Renee Olstead is still the best bet in keeping the tradition of jazz singing alive.  Please, Renee.  On the next collection, give us an organic set with you and a trio.  How about songs like \\"Too Young to Go Steady\\", \\"My Ship\\", \\"I've Never Been in Love Before\\", \\"I'm All Smiles\\", \\"Please Be Kind\\", and \\"I Just Found Out About Love\\".
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|THIS REVIEW IS OF THE BLU-RAY RELEASE    Since the LA Confidential has been reviewed and discussed at great length since it came out over a decade ago, this review will focus on the technical aspects of the Blu-ray release.     Video Quality: The picture quality is demo material. The best thing I can say about it, is that it looks like a 35mm film is being projected on my TV. The image is very clean and sharp, by retains the texture of film. Colors especially looks as they do on film. Overall, the picture is night and day better than the original DVD release. Retail stores should be using a comparison between these two releases to promote Blu-ray.    Audio Quality: I'm not thrilled with the sound. In the Dolby 5.1 mix, and especially the Dolby TrueHD, the sound levels and bass of the sound effects have been turned up extremely high. While this gives your audio system a good workout -- friends have complimented how \\"cinematic\\" my speakers sound when watching this disc -- I frankly find it annoying. Every time a door is shut or someone is punched, it sounds like someone is whacking a bass drum. Automatic guns sounds more like an anti-aircraft guns.    Special Features: WB has included a slew of new special features, most of them weighed towards the actors. I didn't really find them all that substantive. What's missing is a commentary by or lengthy interview with Curtis Hanson. He is the genius behind the film after all.     If you like LA Confidential, this is a mandatory purchase for the fantastic picture quality.
0694003611|5.0|This book was read to me when I was little. It's been packed away for years and has been brought out again to read to my daughter. She's 19m and already loves it. A classic and a favorite!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Fabulous movie, but makes me mad as all get out! It is hard to believe that firefighters, paramedics, and police, that fought so hard for America on 9/11, have to fight to get medical care for the injuries they sustained they day! How awful that they have to go to Cuba to get treatment! America has some issues with health care and this movie brings out many of them!
B001K98MFK|5.0|Before I begin, let me be clear - I am reviewing the actual film, not the media upon which it was delivered.  I have no idea which version I saw, but whatever it was, the subtitles were clear, and the visuals stunning.    Let me say that again, the visuals in this movie are the best I have ever seen in any media up to this point, period.  Considering that this movie came out five years ago, it is a testament to how much effort went into creating this movie.  Even modern marvels like Transformers, or Iron Man,  or Final Fantasy Advent Children pale in comparison to the gorgeous, seamless, vivid, and larger-than-life panoramic views this movie contains.  This movie has outdone Blade Runner, which is usually the movie of choice to cite incredible backdrops.  Close ups are also not compromised - the attention to detail was definitely thorough.    Unfortunately I found this movie less than wholly satisfying - what irked me most was the minimalist dialogue.  The characters were obviously in dour moods throughout the movie, and it unfortunately led to an experience that did not match the visuals.  The almost total lack of the Major, while true to the plot in the original movie, probably added to the darker mood.  Batou seemed quite Spartan in his other incarnations throughout the franchise, and to have a movie where he is the main character...well...there was probably much more that could have been said that wasn't.  That is a shame, given what the characters are surrounded by in this movie.    The dialogue that is present is much too abstract and existentialist for a cyber-crime film.  I know the franchise is a medium for the various authors of GITS to muse about the effects of technological change on various aspects of society, but the topics explored here could have either used much more explanation (especially the replays involving \\"Kim\\"), or much fewer philosophical tautologies.  It detracts from the plot.    All in all, despite my objections of the plot and dialogue,this is a solid movie, with 15/10 visuals that would make even the dumbest plot seem like a rich, fulfilling experience.  Luckily the plot was not that dumb - this movie is watchable even the 10th time around.
B0007MA9QQ|5.0|This movie is so great! I was appalled at some of the facts, but glad to hear a different side to the story. It is well worth the view even though it is not for the weak of spirit!
B001F290E4|4.0|People get ready for a great sounding CD with lot of soul and meaningful music. I never really paid much attention to Seal until I heard him singing the song \\"People get readay\\" I was in a book store and they had his CD playing as background music. I loved it so much that when I came home I went on line to search for the CD. Take a listen and you will buy the CD too.

B00008BXJG|5.0|To me, classic rock from around the 1969s and 1970s is the center of music.  I think that AC/DC perfectly show that genre, and although people talk about this is where they softened up, I have to argue with that.  What I find interesting about this album is it was made by everyone from the Brian Johnson era, but with Bon Scott instead, which is perfect because you get AC/DC's classic vocalist, with the people from their classic era.<br /><br />I think that the songs are all great songs, and the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Angus Young and Malcolm Young are a great guitar duo, Bon Scott's singing gives AC/DC what they need, and the rhythm section of Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd backs it all up.  I can't really see much of what Robert Lange really did as a producer, but whatever it was, I think he did a great job.  Mark Dearnley did a great job mixing, and I also should mention that it took a while before I realized how important the mixing can be to the music.<br /><br />The songs are all great.  The title track is regularly played, and just about everyone knows it, but the other tracks are all incredible.  When thinking about each song, I start humming the chorus and feel like getting up and jumping around.  Although I really like how a lot of the more modern rock music shows a lot more deep dark emotions, I think that the classic stuff is still the center of music.

B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath started out when two bands split up and combined to become the Polka Tulk Blues Company.  Around then, guitarist, Tony Iommi cut a couple of his fingertips off, and he melted bottle caps and put leather coverings on.  The Polka Tulk Blues Company changed their name to Polka Tulk and soon later to Earth.  However, they were booked when another band called Earth was expected.  They then moved into a direction to scare people and became Black Sabbath.<br /><br />This album was originally titled War Pigs, which is why the cover is what it is.  However, the label wanted it to be called Paranoid, and the title song, \\"Paranoid\\" was originally intended as filler.  There really isn't any filler on this album.  Each track is great.  \\"Planet Caravan\\" should be mentioned as an interesting highlight.  It is not as heavy as the other tunes.  However, that helps because eventually the heaviness stops being so heavy, so that was to create a contrast.  Tommy Lee of Motley Crue also pointed out that you need to show an emotional side because otherwise your fake.<br /><br />\\"War Pigs\\" is probably the big highlight of the album.  However, \\"Iron Man\\" is probably the most well-known of all of the tunes on the album.  I think that \\"Rat Salad\\" is a pretty awesome tune, with a great drum solo.  \\"Jack the Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots\\" is a good ending tune, but \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Hand of Doom\\" are also highlights.  I love the instrumental passage in \\"Electric Funeral.\\"  I think that \\"Hand of Doom\\" also had a great structuring and buildup as well.<br /><br />Now with modern technology and more knowledge on working with microphones, we're able to do stuff that is sound-wise heavier, but when it comes to arrangements and tunes, this is the real deal.  It wasn't perfectly mixed, but it still sounds pretty good, and I think that it's still as heavy as the other stuff.  I think that if you want the combination of the more classic metal style, and the more modern work on sound, I would recommend Master of Puppets by Metallica, but you still should get Paranoid, which is also a little bit more blues influenced that the other stuff, but it works really well.f Puppets by Metallica, but you still should get Paranoid, which is also a little bit more blues influenced that the other stuff, but it works really well.
0810994739|5.0|I'm eight and this is my favorite book I've ever read. At the end the Loded Diper played a funny song, and their mom always interupted. The only time the song sounded nice was when the camera went crazy. The pictures have great jokes and I love the book makes fun of evrybody.
B000002UAX|5.0|When I was three, my dad would go swimming at the YMCA (he wouldn't do what the village people did there, he'd just swim), and there was a nursery there that I'd stay at.  Right by the nursery was a gym, and when we'd walk by it, on our way out, he'd open the door, and one time, the tune that everyone was doing their exercising to was a cover version of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\\"  When we got home, my dad put the Beatles version on, and after that, he showed me the inside cover of the vinyl release, and he pointed to each member and pointed their names out.<br /><br />That was what started it for me, and I really became a huge Beatles freak.  Three years after I first heard the tune, I picked up a guitar, at the age of six.  Now, I'm a guitar performance major at McNally Smith College of Music.<br /><br />This album is a very personal album for me.  However, when listening to it now, much older, it's still a great album.  It covers a lot of different styles of music, and it's primarily a comic album.  My personal favorite Beatles album is probably Abbey Road, but the White Album is a great album.
0440236738|1.0|I always in the past loved Harlan Coben book until I read this one.  I was surprised to find him \\"busting on\\" my home state.  WV has struggled over the years to overcome such negative comments as I read in this book.  I quote speaking of fingerprints, \\"It makes a copy of the fingerprint and then it emails it over to the CJIS in West Virginia.\\"  Next sentence reads. \\"Now that every police force was online-even those in the most hillbilly of Hicksville boonies like them-fingerprints could be sent over the internet for identification.\\" There were other references to my state.     At this point I figured as how I was to illiterate as to finish reading another word, being from West Virginia and all.  I will not bother to waste my money on another book by this man. Shame he took out his \\"literary licence\\" against my state. The copyright on this book was 2002, to bad I didn't read it before I read the new ones.    Goodby Mr. Coben

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the most thrilling and intense books i've read in a while. For those who love Harry Potter and Twilight, I guarantee that you will want to make room on your bookshelf for this book as well. Suzanne Collins used every ingredient that creates a fun and entertaining read for all. The book immediately starts in with Katniss Everdeen and her family, consisting of her mother and sister, on what is a normal day in District 12. Within the first few pages, you feel for Katniss and what she's been through. She basically has to provide for her family since her father died and her mother won't do a thing to lessen the suffering of her children.<br /><br />As for The Hunger Games themself, it IS slightly violent. Therefore, I would not let your young children read it until you, the parent, have read it first.<br /><br />The other aspect of the book is the love story between Katniss and Peeta Mellark. Peeta has loved Katniss since they were just small children and Katniss has been completely oblivious to the whole thing. She has only known his as \\"the boy with the bread\\", who saved her and her family from starvation just after her father died. The love story progresses during the Games, but Katniss still doesn't really believe that what Peeta says and does is actually true! And of course, we don't really find out what happens between them when the book comes to a close:( Oh well, it just leaves me \\"hungry\\" for more;)<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a must read and I think that you will be just as eager for the second installment as I am!
B0016OMFNY|5.0|The legend behind this album has already been told well... recorded in ten days' time in Bob Dylan's home recording studio, ten tracks were released by five of the monuments of rock, all recording under pseudonyms, with liner notes of a group history that never happened.      The songs on the album cover a vast history of rock, offering a variety of different influences and even eras.  The first and last songs, the bookends, tell the history of rock in metaphor.      \\"Handle with Care\\" is, perhaps, the most honest writing about what being a rock star felt like: \\"Sent to meetings hypnotized... over-exposed, commercialized...\\"  You imagine any of the band (Petty, Lynne, Orbison, Harrison, Dylan) at the height of fame, staggering into a record company meeting after an all-night bender, signing a contract they barely understand for an album they don't want to produce for money they don't need.    Most of the other songs on the album are spare, but still an amazing sampling of what five rock geniuses can put together in a few short hours, if inspired to do so.  I will let the strengths and weaknesses of these songs speak for themselves.    The final song, however, is something utterly unique and meaningful.  The five Wilburys sing \\"End of the Line\\" together, in fact in the order they are pictured on the cover.  Dylan whines through the first verse, then Jeff Lynne's country sensibility overtakes him, mixing ideas of working-man strength and getting by.  Petty chimes in musing about the future, and references Hendrix.  Then, Orbison, the old, dirty, angel of rock tells you the end is near (which it was for him), but that all will be well.  Harrison's Liverpool accent takes over, and you can't help but feel as though you've read the last chapter of the history of rock.  It was a good story, an imperfect one, but ultimately an amazing ride.  Rest in peace.

B0015OKWL2|3.0|I'm sorry to have to say it but this movie was disappointing. I`ve been looking forward to seeing it for months. I had preordered the DVD already last year. And then I fell asleep during the first viewing.   Where are those movies like \\"Heat\\", \\"Good Fellas\\", \\"Sleepers\\", \\"Casino\\", \\"Ronin\\" or \\"The Score\\", just to name a few? Nobody seems to make them anymore.  Robert de Niro and Al Pacino in one movie! I really expected more. All I got was average at the best.   The storyline is kind of confusing in the beginning, then it gets better with its final twist close to the end. There could have been made something better out of this story, something like the movie \\"The Brave One\\" with Jodie Foster.  In this movie you can identify with the main characters and feel for them. In \\"The Righteous Kill\\" none of the characters are really likable. The main characters are played by two of the most brilliant actors of our time, but there wasn't much to act for them. There is not a single scene that touches on human emotions, nothing to sink your teeth into. The dialogs are also not worth mentioning.   I even watched the movie a second and third time but it didn't get any better.
1434609723|5.0|Call me an overly-sensitive sap, but I think Pollyanna is a wonderful story.  While it may not be \\"great literature,\\" its optimistic, silver-lining-on-every-cloud message is inspiring, valuable, and timeless.  Pollyanna demonstrates the \\"proactivity\\" described in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: namely that you have the power and the freedom to choose your response in any given situation.  As human beings, we have the ability to choose to not be controlled by our circumstances; happiness is a choice.  Granted, constant happiness is not realistic, and Pollyanna experiences challenges that would bring anyone down, and we see her humanity when she loses her ability to see the silver lining.  I can see how cynical people would complain about how unrealistic the book is, but it is obviously about an EXCEPTIONAL person, someone we should all strive to emulate; and these exceptional people who can choose, maybe not happiness in every circumstance, but at least to find meaning and a reason and drive to keep living DO EXIST (see the extreme example of Victor Frankl's experience in concentration camps).    I pity the kids whose negative reviews tell me that they've lost their childhood innocence.  Maybe the ends are too neatly tied in the end and maybe the characters are cliche, but its sweetness and innocence and the overall inspiring message of optimism make Pollyanna worth reading - and aren't those neatly tied happy endings just so satisfying sometimes?  And to those who complain of her similarities to Anne Shirley - what's wrong with that?  The story IS different; and we can all stand to benefit from reading more positive, life-affirming, soul-nurturing books.
0321356683|5.0|If you write Java for a living Bloch's Effective Java could be your most useful purchase.

1439102813|5.0|Not all books should be easy on the emotions; though I don't want a steady diet of novels that make me sad, nervous, frightened ot otherwise anxious, occasionally reading a story from an author who presents a slice of life difficult to experience helps me grow. Joyce Carol Oates is one of those authors (I need to be sure I can handle difficut topics before I tackle one of her novels).     If this 1st novel by Lisa Genova is a hint of works to come, I may need to think twice before starting her next books. Still Alice is a story that challenged my emotions. It is based on one of life's most unsettling, relentless and equalizing themes: our powerlessness to win the battle against some degenerative diseases. Like the central character, I and many of my friends are 50-something professional women, so while reading the book, I found it too easy to see the possibility of Alzheimer's Disease affecting my life, either personally or through a loved one, in the way it affected Alice and her family.    So did I enjoy reading the book? Not really. Am I glad I did? Absolutely. Lisa Genova's writing style was simple but not simplistic. And while focusing primarily on Alice's personal battle with Alzeimer's Disease, there was enough depth in the supporting family members struggles to make it believeable and give Alice's life texture.

B000ZLFALI|4.0|When I first came across Across the Universe, it looked a little esoteric, even with the musical pedigree of the Beatles.  But from the first minute when Jim Sturgess sings \\"Girl\\" - it all makes sense.  You have to really respect how well the Beatles' musical legacy has been woven into this effort. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr made some of the greatest music of the 20th century and besides being a nice movie, Across the Universe really puts that into focus.  The power of the songs comes alive at every turn.<br /><br />Vividly imagined with beautiful art direction and cinematography, Across the Universe expertly weaves the Beatles into the socio-political context of the times the songs were written in.  Hats off to director Julie Taymor and team who clearly thought this out very well, and the excellent cast who all sing better than anyone would expect.  This is quite a feat, considering that it could have come off cheesily or poorly done.  Actor Sturgess reminds me of a young Paul McCartney but that's where the resemblance to anything Beatles ends.<br /><br />It's a pity Across the Universe didn't succeed as well in the theatres, but I suspect that the treatment may have been too intelligent for today's audiences.  It's a movie that comes from the heart that every Beatles fan should watch and those curious about the music can check out.

B001NOMNZW|5.0|My family (especially my youngest daughter!) has enjoyed all three of the High School Musical movies.  This movie offers wholesome entertainment that your children can watch without being subjected to the suggestive language or images found in too many of the \\"family\\" movies being produced today. This version was a good value as it also includes the DVD and digital edition. I am very happy that the DVD included with this Blu-ray version contains all of the DVD bonus features (the same features on the extended DVD in the 2-disc Extended Edition DVD set). This movie is a great finish to the High School Musical Trilogy, and is a must to own for any fan of the Wildcats!
B001RLJ26Y|5.0|I was a little bit concenred by the last two episodes that Fringe was starting to lose it's focus, but I was pleasantly surprised by \\"The Transformation\\"! Fringe has returned to it's sci-fi, paranormal investigation roots with a lesser focus on the main character's love interests. I am a little weary that they're starting to overuse the \\"Tank\\" concept, but as long as they let John go for good, this is a great final use of it.<br /><br />Again, great episode that's really help the show regain focus.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My son tried to introduce me to this series when it actually ran on TV, and for whatever the reasons I never did see it back then.  Then a co-worker lent me his DVD set of the series and I started watching the episodes during my lunch breaks.  After viewing his DVD set at least six times in full, I reluctantly gave it back to him and purchased one for myself via Amazon.<br /><br />Amazon's price was very fair, as I was able to take advantage of a 60% discount special, but I honestly would have paid the original price for this DVD set as the series is absolutely great.  If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it in it's entirety at least once before you judge.  Captain Malcom Reynolds doesn't appeal to everyone right away; he comes off at first as rather smarmy and arrogant.  After you've become a fan of the series you realize that his smarmy and arrogant nature is both necessary and integral to the core of his character.  He's not nearly as superficial as he seems at first.<br /><br />What can I possibly say about this series that hasn't all ready been said?  It is nearly perfect, and certainly Joss Whedon's masterpiece (sorry, Buffy fans, I prefer this series to that one).<br /><br />Buy the set and give it the chance it's due - you won't regret this purchase.
1402756399|5.0|First of all, this particular edition is a magnificently illustrated edition that includes much information and images related to not only Origin, but also Darwin's life. The first edition included is the edition that is most recommended by scholars, for historical significance, but as well for being less diluted by conciliatory remarks toward the religiously offended.<br /><br />Published in 1859 initially, this was the defining publication for Darwin's life's work. It is no wonder. After reading it for the first time, I had to admit that anyone against evolution likely has never read the book, however they may be educated. His arguments are very cautious, cogent, detailed, and persuasive. All of the arguments I ever heard against evolution, he introduces in this work as possible detriments to his theory, then soundly quashes every one of those arguments with pages of reasons and examples for why those arguments are untenable, and in a completely humble and careful manner.<br /><br />An example is the &#34;irreducible complexity&#34; of the eye. He gives examples of various stages of organs of sight that exist in the living world, from very complex, as with ours, down to stalks with the most primitive sensing organs that can only tell the difference between light and dark, and shows the relation from one stage to another. He also wonders what we are to do with animals with vestigial eyes, such as moles, with eyes covered in skin and hair in many instances.<br /><br />It is suspected, after reading this work, how little it is read by Christian and ID apologists. It is also seen how sound evolution is, and though Darwin did not originate the idea - as many scientists before and during his time knew there had to be something like it - he is the one that carefully examined and put forth a workable mechanism - Natural Selection.
B001CZVVVO|5.0|This is a preeminent Blu-Ray release in all aspects of performance, HD video and 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio achievement.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Wow, I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.<br /><br />It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time, then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.<br /><br />The Jews were the chosen, BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now, if they accept Christ, they will also be redeemed.<br /><br />This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved.
141690977X|2.0|Most of the best men on this planet WILL NOT track you down, make every attempt to contact you etc...    Good men have been taught to be respectful and give you space. Its very individual. Kinda like that other BS from that book \\"if he likes you, he will ask you out\\". Heck that's untrue, in fact its inverse. The more you like a girl, the more excuses you make to ask her out and the more the nerves you have. So you end up asking out a woman you think \\"you have a chance with\\".    That movie/book and its rules are a good way of setting yourself up to attract jerks, stalkers and perverts, while keeping good men away.    If you like a guy, take some action. Its the 21st century. You call him. Only if you've done your share of the work and he hasn't reciprocicated, then he's not into you.    FACT: If a man does everything perfectly, without hesitancy and says the right things at the right times - he IS A PLAYER, and he got that skill by going through a bunch of women, effing them and then dumping them. The movie tells you that unless a man acts perfectly and without hesitancy and superior boldness, he's not into you. ITS THE OPPOSITE. What a great way to set yourself up for players lol. An actual book that tells women how to get played by even more womanizers. How beatiful. NOT.    In fact, this book is so bad, it doesn't deserve me writing a coherent review and editing it finely. I could barely read (or even skim) the book without cringing.
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Little Richard is one of the few seminal figures in rock for whom I didn't have a complete disc.  This collection fills that space admirably.  The sound is excellent for tracks recorded from 1955-1957.  Little Richard was a ribald spirit whose flare bubbled with fun.  His hits like \\"Tutti Frutti,\\" \\"Long Tall Sally\\" & \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\" are all here.  Tracks like \\"Rip It Up\\" & \\"Ready Teddy\\" explode with Richard's voice rough & raunchy.  \\"The Girl Can't Help It\\" that I knew from records by Bobby Vee, The Everly Brothers and The Animals burns here in Little Richard's version.  \\"Lucille\\" still rips me up with its unvarnished rock n' roll joy.  \\"Jenny Jenny\\" & \\"Keep A-Knockin'\\" are both classic blasts.  It's hard to believe that one guy could have recorded so many rock classics in such a short period, but Little Richard was burning hot.  This disc captures that energy 50 years later.  Enjoy!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|A great movie with possibly the greatest number of totally implausible scenes in one place.  Breaking and entering into Tuck's house is a good place to start.  Or, when Andie gets an audition to the traditional \\"stuffy ballet school\\" in less than 24 hours.  Or when Chase gets jumped, and receives four--count 'em--four kicks to the ribs, but is dancing up a storm the next day.      Also, quite possibly the most formulaic movie ever, with traditional old-school Christian values as the controlling force.  Pleasantly moralistic.    Anyway, the interesting thing about this movie (to me) is that Hip-Hop dancing is no longer for the amateurs.  Hip-Hop is now learned in schools, with training as rigorous as ballet.  And it shows, for this movie is over-charged with great dancing.  Quite amazing!
0316017922|5.0|What a great book!  Fascinating!  Confirms my choice to invest in my kids as a stay at home mom!  Would highly recommend this book to anyone for many different reasons, everyone can get something from a book like this!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show.  SUPERNATURAL is by far my favorite show... and it is the best one on TV.  Season 3 was AMAZING.  Just when I think the show can't get any better, it somehow seems to surpass the previous season.  This is a must-have for all fans of the show and anyone who likes this type of action.
B000S6LT42|5.0|The Stones \\"Biggest Bang\\" Tour went on for over a year.  It climaxed when they played for a million people on the beach in Rio.  The only time you see crowds like this these days is with computer animation, but this time it was real.  It's an awesome documentary/concert combination.  The fans in Rio went nuts.  It's on \\"The Biggest Bang\\".<br /><br />But the documentary suffers in comparison with \\"Four Flicks\\", which I consider the best choice between the two packages.  Of course, there are other alternatives out there for Stones concerts on video.  The most recent \\"Shine a Light\\" catches the band at their best.  But the Austin concert on \\"The Biggest Bang\\" catches the band within weeks of the \\"Shine a Light\\" date.  So, actually, \\"Shine a Light\\", kind of belongs in this collection.  It would have made a better choice than the Japanese and Chinese concert tracks.  Or, the Stones could have included the Las Vegas concert, from November of 08.  I was there, and the boys were smoking that night -- the night after Jagger's father passed (RIP).<br />So, if you are a diehard Stones fan, like myself, you'll pick this up despite the marginal Far East footage.  You'll gape at the crowd in Rio, but you'll return again and again to listen to the Austin concert.  It shows the \\"country\\" side of the Stones like no other concert.  If you're a casual fan, you might consider \\"Four Flicks\\" or \\"Shine a Light\\" (the cheaper option).  \\"Four Flicks\\" shows the band in different venues and has a better documentary.  \\"Shine a Light\\" is a great concert.<br /><br />Since the Stones are well-known for putting out \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums, they might want to consider a DVD containing the best of their concert footage, including the special guests they jam with each tour: Jack White, Cristina Aguilera, Bo Diddley (RIP), Bonnie Raitt, and the rest.
B000006YXV|5.0|This cd is great.  I have been searching for a track off this cd for a while and was pleased to find it available here.  Abraham, Martin, & John by Marvin Gaye is a beautiful song and no one else can deliver this song like Marvin Gaye.  Wonderful!
B00000I07Q|4.0|This is far from my favorite Bon Jovi album, but I still really like a lot of the songs on it. \\"Bad Medicine\\" manages to be both silly and clever, \\"I'll Be There for You\\" isn't the simple love ballad it initially appears to be (pay attention to the lyrics in the verses and the bridge) and my personal favorite, \\"Living in Sin,\\" is surprisingly thoughtful, not to mention beautiful musically. \\"Ride Cowboy Ride\\" seems completely pointless, and I don't much care for \\"Love for Sale,\\" but overall it's a solid collection.
0060922583|1.0|Ooooops!  I thought this was a book on science.  My mistake....turns out to be a book on the occult!  First two or three chapters get you hooked on the Holographic theory, which may, in fact, have some validity.  But then it turns to the dark side....dreams, precognition, auras, etc, etc, ad nauseam, ad absurdum.  Junk science!  Right up there with Chariots of the Gods.
B001P5HI4A|1.0|Received the DVD with great anticipation.  DVD #2 ran with a very annoying humming sound.  DVD#1 would not run at all.  All my other movies run on my DVD player.  Extremely disappointed.  Want a refund.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I have this series on regular DVD and watch the entire series at least once a month.  However, the regular DVD quality looks like a VHS home copy from the '80's; uneven, fuzzy and bleached out.  So I ordered the Blu-ray version from the UK (it's not out in North America yet, and Blu-ray is zone-free) and it came from amazon.co.uk within a week.    The Blu-ray improvement has to be seen to be believed.  The background, horses, dresses, colours, rooms, were all amazing.  I had never noticed many of these details in the regular DVD.  As I was watching it the first time, I kept on saying to myself, I didn't realize that room was pink, or that Lydia was wearing blue, or that Charlotte Lucas only wore purple.  The detail on the outdoor scenes and the indoor rooms is amazing.  On the Blu-ray, the colours are very rich, and it looks so new, it actually looks like a 2009 version of Pride and Prejudice.    An additional advantage is that they re-did the audio.  I caught conversations that I had missed before (who knew that Mr. Hurst had more than 1 line?).  Even Mrs. Bennet wasn't half as annoying because her voice was no longer so tinny.    Apparently they went back to the actual film negatives and restored it frame by frame (it's explained in a technical featurette). That's why the colour and audio are so improved.    There are only 2 downsides. One is that with the higher amount of detail, Elizabeth Bennet is not quite so creamy-skinned and beautiful as she is in the bleached out regular DVD.  The other is that it has 2 new featurettes, but not the \\"making of pride and prejudice\\" which is present on the regular DVD version.    Given the price, the huge improvement in the video quality and sound, I would highly recommend this blu-ray version.
1419337319|5.0|Other reviewers have disregarded Camus and his works as inferior imitations of Kafka, Dostoyevsky, and Satre. This is utter nonsense. Such derision neglects the nuances of Camus' absurdist expositions in both the Stranger as well as the Myth of Sisyphus. In fact, anyone remotely familiar with Camus (hell - check out his wikipedia article) would know that neither he nor his works fall neatly under the umbrella of existential philosophical traditions. Having said that, I would like to share some thoughts regarding his most famous book.      In The Stranger, Camus presents the tale of a protagonist who is an organic vacuum - bereft of objectivity and purpose - Meursault - a government worker in Algiers whose life transpires in a succession of indifferent and quotidian occurrences. Quite simply, Meursault consumes his life in a psuedo-nihilist malaise. Unflappable to the vicissitudes of sorrows and joys, no larger purpose (be it ethical, professional, etc.) commands his action. The death and funeral of his mother inspires only feelings of agitation and inconvenience (due to the oppressive heat), while is ultimate incarceration and execution induce only the sensation of annoyance. His life in general is aimless and arbitrary, dictated by pragmatic whims for impulsive gratification (drink when thirsty, have sex when horny, sleep when tired, etc.)     Hence, Meursault befriends his scumbag neighbor Raymond - a woman beater and criminal - simply because he offered him dinner and Meursault was hungry and didn't want to cook. This indifference permeates Meursault's consciousness, and results in the climax of the book - in which Meursault murders an Arab on the beaches of Algeria. While this constitutes the most punishable action one human can commit, Meursault never acknowledges any sort of gravity in murdering the Arab, because as he conceives no purpose in his life, no action means more than the next. Consequently, while many scholars and readers have tirelessly examined the events of the book leading up to the murder to understand 'why', the no less important question is 'why not'? In the pivotal moments on the beach before he unfurls the gun and kills the Arab, Meursault comes to a crucial epiphany: 'It was then I realized that you could either shoot or not shoot.\\" In a purposeless existence, what is the difference?    The rest of Meursault's life can not instill in him any purpose or meaning. While Meursault admits he committed a crime which deserves punishment, his admission does not effectuate any revision in his worldview. Murder and execution is his fate - and this fate is no more nor no less significant. Without any external absolute to instill meaning, man can live his life how he pleases. Since meaningless spares no space of the universe, no place nor condition is better than the next. While Meursault is supposed to feel unhappy in prison - it is a condition to which he grows accustomed, and he even says:     \\"If I had to do live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowering overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it. I would have waited for birds to fly by or clouds to mingle, just as here I waited to see my lawyer's ties and just as, in another world, I used to wait patiently until Saturday to hold Marie's body in my arms.\\"     Even in a life in which (for example) love, liberty, morals, etc. exist, Camus (through Meursault) indicates that death - which unilaterally negates all - renders them meaningless. In terms of love, while Meursault has feelings resembling affection (one might argue intimacy) for his coworker Marie, he abstains from designating such feelings as love, claiming it doesn't mean anything. As he contemplates his imprisonment in jail, he does not consider prison any more confining than the inherent vertical bars of space and time that circumscribe existence into the curt contours of a human lifespan. Obviously, morals too convey no authority for action. Foreven if humans possessed rational objectivity to formulate a scheme of 'good and 'bad' - this framework is also negated by a finite existence which does not concern how or why we act.    Claiming a certainty in metaphysical nothingness would misrepresent Camus and correlated beliefs. However, Camus does suggest that man and the universe that keeps him is utterly incapable of educing any meaningful metaphysical reality or truth. In the wake of such impotence is an implicit nothingness. The nullity of metaphysical reality, therefore, is incapable of providing some sort of guide as to how one should exercise his existence or interpret its meaning. All that is left is an immutable nothingness that cares not how we enter it.    Even if Meursault repented for his murder, retained his freedom, and sought to find purpose anew - nothing would change. Meursault indeed imagines a life emancipated from the Algerian prison (\\"a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual\\"), only to deduce that the world in itself constitutes a terrestrial prison - and prior to the transient human concepts of 'justice' and 'punishment' that sentence him now - he was already sentenced to die by an existence that summons down the guillotine to us all in irrevocable finality - this is the \\"implacable ritual\\" that we can not escape. Hence even with another episode of existence by mercy, fortune, or even reincarnation, Meursault concludes that \\"I would just be caught up in the machinery again.\\" His only destiny would be to die once more - by the pronouncements of human justice or the mandate of material reality - it matters not.    Camus' (through Meursault) nihilistic disregard for conventional feelings regarding life and morals alarms both the characters and reader alike, but he would argue that he is confronting existence with an honesty few do. Through this honest prism - existence reveals itself bare, naked, and most of all, absurd. The chasm between what we want to know (all-knowing) and wantto be (all-existent), and what we can know and what we can be, is a gulf so tragically vast as to approach humor. While other individuals attempt to abridge this gulf by the 'leaps' and 'hopes' of theological, ethical, and spiritual purpose, Camus has his protagonist revolt against both the gap and the leap by living without hope or belief in reconciliation of the vast gulf. The consistent theme of the sweltering heat and sun represents the oppressive and omnipresent 'absurd' that weighs down man's existence (it is this dogged heat/angst that is the critical impetus to Meursault's murder as well). As such, it is significant that in the torrid courtroom, while the court occupants vigorously and fruitlessly attempt to cool themselves by waving fans in their face, Meursault simply suffers the insuppressible heat with no attempt to repel it.     Regarding the charges that his philosophy and his book are 'dangerous', 'depressing', or 'scary', Camus would argue these characterizations are apt for a society which stubbornly continues to deny the absurdity of existence with one leap after another. The title itself, \\"the Stranger\\", perhaps does not refer to Meursault but to 'man' collectively. He is an organism whose consciousness necessitates some sort of purpose - and the universe can not provide him with the answers he needs to be content. Whether one chooses to designate himself as 'strange' or 'special', the fact remains that we are the only beings who are inevitably bothered (hence the angst) by our existence, and whereas everything can just be, we strive for 'place' in a universe that could just care less. This is why some existentialist readers consider Meursault a hero: he has transcended the angst, and he is not bothered enough by existence to resort to sophistic illusions of meaning and purpose. Whether on an Algerian beach, in a sweltering prison, or the trunk of the tree, he will get by just fine.     Many people label the Stranger as dangerous (in its amoral implications and nihilistic message) and condemn Meursault's disposition as frightening. Indeed, life as finite and meaningless: how many of us as conscious beings who enjoy existence are willing to accept such a proposition? Personally, it is difficult to accept such an unequivocal abdication of purpose in our lives as humans, and to do so bears some serious implications. If one does do so, there is absolutely no principle nor external force/being to dissuade someone from acting just as Meursault does and killing someone just for laughing in the sun. There are a plethora of religious, spiritual, and ethical works and authors who explicate our meaning as humans and merit our attention as readers. But in the discussion of metaphysical meaning, Camus's captivating novel deserves our attention as well. In it, readers subscribing to existentialism and/or nihilism will find a masterpiece and a hero.
0425223523|5.0|Captain Wentworth's Diary - I cannot get tired of reading  and re reading all of Jane Austen books.  To have something new by another author that will give us more or open our eyes to something new that perhaps was implied but not declared in Jane Austen books about our hero in  \\"Persuasion\\"  is like reading  Jane all over again.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Charleton Heston had taken on some historical character parts, but El Cid,  Don Diego de Vivar, was a different type.  In the area of Spain which was correct for the times (1070-1088) there was not enough data to support why The Cid did what he did. I guess one must make the time to put 20 years of history in 3 to 4 hours, or is under the gun to create a credible movie.  The movie is excellent as to the time in history, its content and the roles.  I would reccommend the movie for its magnificent special effects ( for the time 1961), and its cast.  Listen to and watch the reactions to the Arab Moors, as well as the Christian knights and kings, really researched and played out well.  Heston at his best, and Sophia Loren as beautiful as ever as the wife.  I give the movie 5 stars.
0316017922|3.0|This book addresses that age old issue of \\"nature vs. nurture\\" - are people outliers (successful) because of some innate talent or ability, or because of their upbringing and culture? As usual, the answer is both - though Gladwell gives much more weight to culture, opportunity, and hard work. He digs up some good stories and case studies to prove his point - lots of fun stuff to discuss! The emphasize on practice and hard work is encouraging (\\"Maybe I can be an outlier!\\"), but the part about culture and opportunity is discouraging because these are harder to influence and control. Gladwell states: \\"Outliers are those who have been given opportunities - and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them.\\" To me, he doesn't adequately address the question of what gives one person this \\"strength and presence of mind\\" and not another. Why don't all people who have opportunity and work hard become outliers? In fact, what is the definition of outlier? Some of the people profiled in the book are very successful people, but are they outliers?<br />Gladwell concludes with \\"To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success - the fortunate birth dates and happy accidents of history - with a society that provides opportunities for all.\\" I agree that we should try to provide opportunities for all - particularly for children through our educational system, but there will always be the influences of culture, luck, and \\"current events\\" contributing to the creation of outliers.
0743437497|5.0|The movie version of The Shining is my favorite adaptation of Stephen King's works.  However, although I have read dozens of his books (including the entire Dark Tower series), I had never read The Shining.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, including watching the points at which the film and written versions diverged.<br /><br />The book differs from the movie at several key points.  First, there is a much more detailed backstory.  With an author's luxury of pacing, King develops a detailed portrait of Jack Torrance as a flawed human being on the razor's edge between redemption and destruction.  His alcoholism and temper are challenges he must overcome to save his family and to achieve his potential as a writer.  The caretaking job at The Overlook is much more than just the backdrop for a spooky story.  It is Jack's last chance to get back on track after being fired from his job at a prestigious private school.<br /><br />The written story builds slowly to a boiling point, avoiding the visual shocks of the movie(which were admittedly one of the film's biggest attractions).  This allows the author to develop the deep love between Jack and his haunted son Danny, making the ultimate betrayal so much more disturbing.  The book also develops the character of Jack's potential as a writer.  Indeed, an important step on Jack's descent into madness is his obsession with the hotel's history as the source for a future novel.  Instead of writing the hotel's story, he becomes part of it.<br /><br />The written version of The Shining is a deeper, more complex story, but still one which builds to a thrilling, cinematic climax.  It is well worth reading the book as a companion to the movie.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I'm aware of the many criticisms leveled against this film, but I consider it to be one of Kubrick's finest, and it's one of my all-time favorite movies.  Perhaps more than in any  of his other films, he makes effective use of a seemingly endless stream of striking images and gorgeous music to create a highly atmospheric ambience.     Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is substandard, with an apparently non-anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio that stretches out the image horizontally (at least on my LCD HDTV).  The picture quality is not as clear as it should be, even allowing for the deliberately dark scenes shot only by candle-light.  This film would look a lot better with a quality remastering.    The audio is presented in reasonably good Dolby 5.1, but I'm hoping that when this film is remastered for Blu-Ray, it will receive a major improvement in the picture quality as well as a more robust audio track.      People complain that Ryan O'Neal was somehow miscast or did a bad job of acting.  I disagree.  The main character in this film is a highly flawed human being who brings about his own downfall due to his various failings. That's part of the whole story.  O'Neal portrays this character in a direct manner, without any attempts at eliciting false empathy from the audience.      Another criticism some have made is that the film is too long and moves too slowly. The same criticism could be made about most other Kubrick films.  Watching a Kubrick film is not like watching most films.  He took a very long time to shoot his movies, and it seems clear that he expected viewers to be willing to spend time when watching them.  He didn't make popcorn movies (though there's nothing wrong with them;  sometimes you just want 90 minutes of rapid-fire action, appealing characters, and an event-filled plot).     So, the film itself is a masterpiece, the DVD is substandard, and \\"Barry Lyndon\\" deserves a first-rate Blu-Ray transfer so that we can finally see the movie as it was meant to be seen.
0618918248|3.0|It's hard to imagine why theists find the tone of Richard Dawkin's The God Delusion so objectionable.  It's tepid, almost respectful, compared to, say, Bertrand Russell's Why I am Not a Christian or Christopher Hitchen's God is Not Great: How Religion Spoils Everything. What sarcasm appears in the book comes as a welcome relief after reading many pages of missed opportunities to skewer the lunacies of theists.  But I suppose any work that advocates atheism is offensive in tone to believers.<br /><br />Be that as it may, in some respects the work is atheism-lite.  Some of Dawkin's arguments have been voiced numerous times before and are not very rigorous.  When his arguments touch on evolution, his area of expertise, they are more sophisticated.  Otherwise the book largely lacks philosophical depth.<br /><br />Dawkins is an odd writer in ways.  By turns his prose style is both sophisticated and compelling.  Yet it can also be excessively chatty, too frequently elaborating a matter to the point of tedium.  I kept wondering if the original work was much shorter and the publisher encouraged Dawkins to add filler.<br /><br />He is most compelling when he talks about how religion is often abusive to children.  Here he is quite original and this reader gained an important insight from him.  He is also quite good on how natural selection can account for our moral sensibilities.<br /><br />Dawkin's book is probably a good work to read for theists toiling with doubts.  Fanatical believers, of course, won't believe anything he says (or any other atheist for that matter).  Well-read atheists, agnostics and skeptics will mostly find reading the work a chore but one speckled with occasional stunning originality.
B000IFS0HM|4.0|Even at the worst of times people are able to hope for the better.  In the memoir Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, the McCourt family truly hopes for the better at the worst of times. Surrounding himself in poverty, Frank is born in Brooklyn, New York, moving to Limerick, Ireland at an early age, in the 1930s and 1940s. Only by the age of ten, Frank is soon immersed in a life with death, a father who drinks money away, and brought to the attention that he should die for Ireland. Even through the hard times, the impoverished McCourt Family's spirits remain strong.    Frank is absorbed in a life of hunger, sickness, neglect, and a father's alcoholism, \\"I know when my Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money, and Mam is desperate and has to bed at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep?\\"(208). All those effects characterize his reasons to escape from Ireland and rise from poverty.   Frank McCourt's writing and story truly changes your view and melts your heart. With its unique charm it entrances you within. It is narrated in first person, present tense, McCourt writes as he is experiencing it for the first time. It truly captivates you as a reader as it is told by Frank as a child, rather than reflecting on his past as an adult. With having it in immediate past it allows for the true culture of the time to come out. Religion and Irish sayings are used to convey how people really talked during his childhood. The author's tone is different from what you would expect. He writes in a style in which he states ideas as they are happening, which matches the tone as McCourt as a child.     I really enjoyed reading this book. This is the first time I have read a memoir about this time period, in Ireland, and it certainly encourages me to read further.  Being of Irish decent, I appreciate how the author let the reader see how life was in Ireland. Reading it from Frank's point of view as a child made me further understand the life style he had and made me appreciate it even more. The reader learns the culture of that time period through Irish phrases and the use of the reoccurring appearances of religious aspects.   This memoir was a great read that in truly enjoyed. It teaches the reader that even with harsh times one can make the best of it and hope for the better. \\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\"(11)

B001N44BW0|5.0|\\"Body of Lies\\" is a tantalizing film, a microcosm of the war on terrorism anywhere, any time, to anyone. Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent as Roger Ferris, CIA operative extraordinaire in the Middle East, in this case seeking the most dangerous leader of the most dangerous cell.<br /><br />The most revealing line is made by the head of the Jordanian secret police. Before he agrees to work with Ferris in locating this cell leader, he tells him: \\"Do not lie to me.\\" So, at the still point of this film lies truth: What is it? Does it exist? Can a man's word be trusted?<br /><br />The viewer learns that the war on terrorism thwarts clear sight, black washes the brain, and adds chaos and confusion at every step. If there is a truth, it is ephemeral. Russell Crow, as head of operations situated at Langley thousands of miles away, adds to the confusion and chaos. Is his word good? Does he contribute to the Body of Lies?<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott's bottom line is that there can be no trust or truth in the war on terrorism. Methods used in pre-terrorist wars are not effective in the Middle East.<br /><br />Except in the age-old story of love. Ferris begins a lovely and honest relationship with a half-Iranian nurse, a modern woman steeped in traditional Islamic values. A fluent speaker of Arabic, Ferris can fit into the Middle East milieu. Much like Hemingway's Lt. Henry in [[ASIN:B001O9CC02 A Farewell To Arms]], Ferris finds a pocket of truth, of love amidst the chaos of war. This addition to the film is a stroke of genius by Scott to show that, even amidst the ugliness of clandestine, often cruel operations of war, life continues its natural flow. Even a ultimately hardened CIA operative can find the deepest and most tender of feelings during taut, adrenalin-fueled operations of the hunt for a major terrorist. This love story portends hope.<br /><br />The open ending, itself, is intentionally vague, meant, I think, to reflect the time and place, the result of a devastating and constantly changing, amorphous war.<br /><br />\\"Body of Lies\\" is highly recommended for its unflinching examination of the war on terrorism on Islamic grounds, for Islamic threat to bring the war to European and American soil, for revelation of torture apparently inherent in such war, and the horrific, negative effects on the souls of men, but in most cases, whose hearts are kept tender by love commitments. This last point is so subtle, it may pass by you if you don't look for it.s war.     \\"Body of Lies\\" is highly recommended for its unflinching examination of the war on terrorism on Islamic grounds, for Islamic threat to bring the war to European and American soil, for revelation of torture apparently inherent in such war, and the horrific, negative effects on the souls of men, but in most cases, whose hearts are kept tender by love commitments.

0743496736|3.0|I enjoyed My Sister's Keeper and Vanishing Acts immensely, but Nineteen Minutes, not as much.  I agree that Judge Cormier, in the real world, would have been forced to recuse herself immediately.  I agree with another reviewer that this book was all over the place trying to tackle every issue in the world.  I also agree that some of the characters are a bit cliched.      That being said, it is what I imagine would be a realistic portrayal of what the different people involved in such an incident would be going through (though fortunately I don't know first-hand).  She did a great job of capturing the reality that people honestly didn't see it coming and yet they maybe should have at the same time.  No one knows why some victimized kids shoot and some don't.  She accurately captures the essence of high school being hell on earth for some kids.  As parents, we like to believe that we can protect our children and prevent such a thing, whether it be our child getting shot or being the shooter.  Ms. Picoult jolts us out of our complacency and the it-couldn't-happen-here way of thinking.  The fact is that it did in places like Columbine, Paducah, and Pearl, Mississippi.
6305736650|5.0|This is the most romantic, best movie ever made.  My number one all time favorite.  It doesn't get any better than Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.  If this one doesn't knock your socks off, nothing will.  Claude Rains and Paul Henreid are wonderful and give excellent performances, too.  Once you have seen this movie, you will never forget it.
B001JNNE64|5.0|I don't know what the guy was talking about who said this wasn't up to snuff.  It more than is!  Fantastic blu-ray clarity, unbelievable high-def sound.  I pre-ordered and paid full price before the price cut and guess what?  I'm not disappointed!  One of my favorite movies of all time -- it's like seeing it for the first time all over again.  A hearty thank you to all responsible and involved in bringing this gem to blu-ray.

B0010ZR160|5.0|One of the most difficult tasks is adapting a book to the stage of film.  However, this gritty urban (and urbane) drama deserves every star.  It truly is an ensemle cast of excellent actors (and actresses).  When you can forget Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, or that Ed Harris is Ed Harris--there is something magical going on.  From the dirty kitchen sinks of the \\"neighborhood\\" where the narrator grew up, to the quarry tagged in every available space, this rings true and is in a class with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\"--in color.  Every few minutes there is a plot twist, and you don't really know who is good or evil--and in the end, you still will be left wondering.  A great film leaves you with more questions that answers, and I would put this film in that category--especially when they are moral issues.<br /><br />No plot recap is needed here--judge for yourself.  You will not be wasting your time.
0316113506|5.0|Did you know that physical exercise builds and conditions your brain? Do you think of exercise as something you should do? What if you were inspired to exercise? You might be, after reading Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, a book which thoroughly explains the scientific connections between exercise and brain functions.<br /><br />The \\"spark\\" in the title refers to the fact that exercise sparks physical changes that encourage brain cell connections, strengthening the cellular machinery of learning. For example, at a public school in Chicago, students schedule their most difficult subject immediately after physical education class, because of the beneficial effects of exercise on learning. Using scientific studies, statistics from public schools, and evidence from the author's psychiatric practice, Spark explains how exercise improves brain function in these areas: cognition, stress, anxiety, depression, ADHD, addiction, women's health, and aging. This book can be a help for parents seeking remedies other than medication for any of these issues.<br /><br />This is not a self-help book filled with fluff and feel-good platitudes. You can use the principles in this book  to help your children be better prepared for learning with improved mood, focus, and motivation. Adult brains are also flexible, and parents, as we model lifelong learning, can also strengthen our brains with these same principles.
1402210795|5.0|I feel like I have hit the reader's jack pot!  As a huge fan of historical fiction and regency romance, I cannot help but feel I have hit upon a treasure trove of hours of reading delight!<br /><br />In Fridays' Child, the lavish Viscount Sheringham must marry if he is to come into his money before turning 25. After being refused by the most desirable debutant of his aquaintance, he stumbles upon another childhood friend, the penniless and orphaned Miss Hero Wantage, who finds herself in an undesirable pickle -- either marry a dull curate or become a governess.  Sheringham solves their two problems at once by running away with Hero to London, where they marry and embark on one topsy-turvy scrape after another.  This romantic comedy is LOL funny and charming! Heyer's obvious research of the time is apparent in her spot on depictions of Regency London and the Ton.  Loved the coloquial color and satire, very much reminiscent of Jane Austen.<br /><br />I am in a \\"reader's escatasy to learn that Heyer wrote over 50 more novels for me to discover! Friday's Child is lovely. (sigh)
B000301YY8|5.0|Blunt is a unique musician. He's a beutiful lyricist (he could have been a poet) and his songs are true, heartfelt. It doesn't matter whether they're about love or not, they're honest and full of human emotion.<br /><br />He's got a very distinct voice, and when you listen to him, you know that's him. This debut album of his, 'Back to Bedlam', shows clearly that this is an artist that's here to stay.<br /><br />Some of my favorite songs of the album are 'High', 'Goodbye My Lover', and 'Tears and Rain'. I listen to 'High' and it's just an experience, a movie playing out in my head (unfortunately neither of the videos for the song captured it very well, I guess). 'Goodbye My Lover' is at the same time so personal and so universal and I guess that's why it's a favorite. It's so naked. So human. And 'Tears and rain' has a great melody and the lyrics are wonderful.<br /><br />Finally, James performing live is excellent. He always gives 100%, we actually see him completely involved with the song. I've had the chance to watch one of his concerts live here in Rio and I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000YAA68C|5.0|It's been a LONG time since I've been this enchanted with a film.<br />Due to the sappy trailers, I avoided it on cable for months, but<br />finally sat down and watched it from beginning to end. Ever since<br />that first viewing, I've been hooked. I laugh every time, I cry every<br />time, I sit in awe every time, and enjoy each and every minute of this<br />lovely film, which I have since purchased on DVD.<br /><br />What's to love? The movie seamlessly blends the story of the main<br />characters and their past with little confusion. The editing is almost<br />perfect. The cast is brilliant. Highest marks go to Gerard Butler and<br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan for their mastery of the dialect and their unbelievable<br />good looks and charm, as well as Harry Connick Jr., who nails the part of<br />the goofy, socially-challenged bartender. Though not a ravishing beauty,<br />Hillary Swank's performance is sympathetic and convincing, and Lisa<br />Kudrow and Gina Gershon are superb as her supportive sidekicks. Kathy<br />Bates also delivers a seamless performance as the grieving widow's mother.<br /><br />What else is there to love? The movie's beautiful scenery. New York and glorious<br />Ireland are themselves characters in this lovely tale. I am also very partial<br />to the movie's soundtrack, the theme of which is bittersweet and romantic. Most<br />of all, you will love the film's whimsical and lighthearted approach to themes<br />that universally touch us all:  themes of love and loss, anger and confusion,<br />friendship and family, hope and despair. The storyline may be somewhat<br />implausible and there may be no husband on earth as charming and quiescent as<br />Gerard Butler's Gerry, but the mere suggestion that a man like he exists and that<br />the love he shares with Holly trancends his tragic death is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />You don't have to be a \\"chick\\" or a sentimental sap to enjoy this movie. What you do need<br />is a heart. This film will surely touch it in all the right places. Five Stars!
B000SZLSB2|4.0|Blunt is a unique musician, and this follow-up to 'Back to Bedlam' reiterates that. He's a beutiful lyricist (he could have been a poet) and his songs are true, heartfelt. It doesn't matter whether they're about love or not, they're honest and full of human emotion.<br /><br />He's got a very distinct voice, and when you listen to him, you know that's him. 'All the Lost Souls' excells and, at the same time it continues the tradition he's established with his debut album, it also takes his music into new grounds. There is definitely a new sound on the record, whether you listen to the modern 'I'll take everything' or the old-fashioned '1973'.<br /><br />Some of my favorite songs of the album are 'Same Mistake', '1973' and 'I Really Want You'. I have actually used the lyrics to both 'Same Mistake' and 'I really want you' in class with my students - there's a lot to be reflected upon. Some of his lyrics are more straight-forward (like 1973) but others are, as they should be, more open to interpretation. It's interesting to compare what the students have thought to the artist's interpretation of the song, by showing the music video.<br /><br />Finally, James performing live is excellent. He always gives 100%, we actually see him completely involved with the song. I've had the chance to watch one of his concerts live here in Rio and I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0385340990|4.0|Don't get me wrong....this is a nice, little book to curl up with and read on a cold winter's day. Enough reviewers have already given synopses of the story of the German occupation of this picturesque island during WWII, so I'll skip that part. Suffice it to say, it's an enjoyable, quick read with real life characters that are very endearing.  So why not five stars from me?<br /><br />I think I started and put this book down at least five times.  Each time I got bored with it.  At this point, I had only gotten to about page 50.  When I finally decided to push ahead and finish it some weeks later, I had to reread those fifty pages all over again just to get the characters sorted out.  At the beginning of the book, it's hard to remember the relationship between the letter writers -- Sidney (publisher) and Juliet (author) and Susan (publicist) and Sophie (Sidney's sister and Juliet's best friend). I kept forgetting who was who.  Then when Juliet started corresponding with the residents of Guernsey, I knew I would be totally lost if I did not go back and get all of these characters straight in my head. Once I did this, it was smooth sailing until the end.<br /><br />I admit to enjoying epistolary novels because I like the way the story flows.  What I couldn't understand about this one was how a letter written on the 23rd of a given month could be received in time for the recipient to respond by the 24th of that same month given the fact that the recipient was in another town or country.  Even our postal service now cannot perform that miracle so I found it hard to believe this possible in post WWII. Guernsey reminded me of locales in England written about by authors like Rosamunde Pilcher. As I read more and more about the descriptions of the island, I actually felt I was reading either a book by Pilcher or one by Maeve Binchy.<br /><br />I certainly don't want to turn anyone away from reading this novel.  I just think with all the hoopla surrounding it, my expectations were set at a much higher level than could have possibly been achieved by this author.  If you, like myself, are a lover of epistolary novels, some of my favorites are 84 Charing Cross Road by Helene Hanff and These Is My Words by Nancy E. Turner.  There's nothing like reading someone's back and forth correspondence or writings in one's diary to really get to know them .  In this regard, the author was quite successful as I really got a good sense of what the main character, Juliet, was all about.  And all in all, it did make me want to visit this tiny little place in history.<br /><br />As with many books set in a time or place I'm unfamiliar with, I found myself doing so much research about Guernsey and it's inhabitants during the war.  On this subject, the book did do justice to this place in time and did open my eyes to a world I'd known little about. One interesting tidbit I did find out was that in 1855, Victor Hugo found sanctuary on the Isle of Guernsey while fleeing political persecution.  I've also recently added the DVD of Island At War to my Netflix queue.  This is a BBC series of a fictional Channel Island during this time period.<br /><br />So I'd say lower your expectations a bit and you'll probably enjoy it more than I did.igher level than could have possibly been achieved by this author.

0312427646|4.0|The usual obligatory commentary on the back cover of this charming and entertaining little book mentions that it is \\"about why books matter\\" and \\"the subversive power of reading\\". There is doubtless something to that. But more important, it seems to me, it is a book, and in some ways a rather sad one, about the state of the British monarchy. Bennett encapsulates, in a subtle and clever way, the barrenness and insularity of the Queen's life. In the story, but in the story only, she finds a way to break out of this bubble by reading widely and extensively. In real life, one can be sure she does no such thing.<br /><br /> In the Scandinavian countries, Spain and the Netherlands the monarchs are permitted relatively private and contemporary lives. In Britain, the monarchy remains a grand and puffed up national institution, a significant symbol of unity, continuity and tradition. Unfortunately, that fact has forced its members into a staid, stuffy and anachronistic mold. Their scandals and missteps are subject to relentless tabloid gossip and mockery, so much so that they, as well as the entire apparatus which enfolds them, have become a laughingstock. As far as I can tell, the average Englishman is unable to decide whether to be proud or embarrassed by the whole thing. Most, I believe, are a bit of both.

B000ADWDF2|4.0|This Danish film about a coalition soldier in Afghanistan deftly portrays the impact of combat on noncombatants far from the battlefield. Though arguably not an accurate case study of PTSD, \\"Brothers\\" represents very plausibly the unexpressed anguish of returning soldiers who have witnessed or been a part of horrific, soul-shattering experiences. And it depicts the havoc that their experience - unresolved - can exert at home, especially when what waits for them on their return are family members with their own dysfunctions and emotional baggage. The performances in this film are quite plausible, and while it sometimes strays in the direction of melodrama, it often pulls us up short with glimpses of very real people struggling against the odds. Well worth seeing.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I thought this movie was well-paced and that the dialogue was interesting and quirky, but somehow it felt lacking in substance by the end. To be sure all of the actors turned out great performances, especially Penelope Cruz, and the eye candy of Barcelona and Oviedo, not to mention the sultry, fun music, was exciting. But the actual plot is so thin and the character development so lacking, that once I reached the end I felt like there was nothing to carry away from this film.<br /><br />Vicky and Cristina both face separate problems when it comes to romance. Cristina wants someone to settle with. Vicky wants someone to ignite her passion, which she isn't getting from her nice but dull fiance. Both of them think they might find solutions to their problems with the refreshing, exotic Juan Antonio, but neither of them can because they can't change themselves. The change of scenery can't change their habits in dealing with romance. Maria Elena and Juan Antonio have the passion, but not the stability. And the film is pervaded with the sense that they will never find that quality, and are shackled to a kind of half-love.<br /><br />It seems like Woody Allen is critiquing all forms of romantic relationships as ultimately unsatisfying if not outright doomed to failure, and I found this to be cynical and unfair. Vicky and Cristina seem to go through a series of potentially life-altering experiences, but in the end they are the same as they were before they came to Barcelona, except maybe a little unhappier. It seems like a terrible waste of opportunity. And without question, Maria Elena and Juan Antonio don't develop at all, and you just know that they will continue on as they always have.<br /><br />And I couldn't help but feel that the narration was in place because the feelings and actions of the characters weren't relatable enough without it, and that's not good, especially in a film; either not enough work went into showing, or else there was little to show in the first place. I think it was a little of both in this case.<br /><br />This movie was saved by a seductive sensory experience of Catalonia, but it couldn't quite make up for the lackluster story or the static characters. Any deep revelations it tried to make were muddled and fell flat. The only thing this movie leaves you with is that relationships fail and people are too complicated to work through it. To sum it up with a line from Juan Antonio: \\"Love is so transient.\\" That's just not true, but the characters will apparently never understand that. Even if they do see that they have to reconcile the problems within themselves before they can succeed in love and life, they won't try. And I didn't find that inspiring or even worthy of sympathy.a little of both in this case.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|If there is such category of the movies as 'fairy tales for adults\\" this is the one.  Shot on many exotic locations throughout the world this film provides imaginary and visual beauty that I have not seen yet.  Set in Los Angeles hospital  at at he turn of the century, film explores the unlikely friendship between a (silent) movie stunt man and a young girl from a migrant worker family.  Both are emotionally damaged and lonely.  Girl's father has been killed during a robery and the stunt man was seriously injured in his film and his girlfriend has betrayed him with another man.  Both man and a little girl want something from each other - mainly escape from the world of reality.<br /><br />The man weaves a fairy tale story about five mysterious man from around the world.  His story slowly seems to overlap with reality.  As the young girl start to realize that the fairy tale is truning into fight between the sick man's internal demons she begs him to live since he has grown to love him as her surrogate father.<br /><br />It has not been since \\"The Pan's Labyrinth\\" that I have cried watching a movie like this one where main protagonist is a lovely little girl learning about ways of the world.  She is so pure and innocent that one cannot reject her hope for the better world.<br /><br />This film is absolutely magical.  It is suited for both children and adults.  Director's choice of Bethoven's Symphony No. & Opus 92 gives this film another dimension of beauty and depth.  Costumes, and scenes from some of the most beautiful world locations are of such captivating beauty that I must say qualifies this film to a true work of art.
0634049011|4.0|This is a very well-thought out and extremely clear explanation of the structure and lay-out of the guitar fretboard that will give the diligent reader the means to both grasp the location of any note on the guitar fretboard but also use that knowledge to produce scales, arpeggios, and other musical forms appropriate to the music they seek to play.  Having purchased similar books in the past, what impresses me most about this book is how each chapter is broken down into reasonable 'bite-sized' and digestable chunks of information which both build upon the previous lesson and logically lead to the next.

B00000269G|1.0|I was lucky enough to meet the marvelous Erroll Garner in 1973 after what would be his last appearance in France. I was learning piano, was really one ofte worse player ever but he showed me a few tricks. He also took more than an hour of his precious time to talk with me. Of course, we couldn't avoid mentionning talking about \\"Concert By The Sea\\" and I was more than surprised to learn that he wasn't happy with the LP. He was unhappy with the choice of the tunes.As an example, he wouldhave loved that his rendition of \\"Bernie's Tune\\" had been rejected against his will.    So I strongly recommend that people wait for a complete issue, specially considering that \\"the best is yet to come\\" and will be within 5 years.

0425200450|5.0|When a murder is committed aboard the Orient Express, it is up to Hercule Poirot to find the culprit. Mr Poirot certainly has his work cut out for him. There are twelve suspects, but none seem to have a strong motive and most have an alibi. There is a major clue pointing to the identity of the murder in the beginning of the book. After finishing the novel I found myself laughing that I could have overlooked something so obvious. Nonetheless, it was an entertaining read. So many clues, so many suspects, yet Mr Poirot and the two men who assist him with the mystery, the doctor who examined the body and the director of train, come up with nothing but dead end theories until the end of the book. Truly genius!

From being force fed high fructose corn syrup to the manipulation of the diets of the animals and fish we eat. The sections on eating wild are funny and factual. Did you know you can catch yeast out of the air to make bread???    I am even more convinced now, than before, to eat local food whenever it is available. This book is a must read even if you are not an advocate for eat local.
0525951113|1.0|The first 350 pages are pretty darn good. The plot, while somewhat hidden is plausible. The technology and explanations are entertaining and don't overtake the plot or your suspension of disbelief. The characters, while pretty 2-dimensional, are at least the equivalent of a Grisham novel. Unfortunately, the last 50 pages are horrible!<br /><br />It's like Neo comes out of nowhere and like a super hero with batman toys tears everything up. The whole plot becomes ludicrous. Worse, the author pulls a Robert Jordan and ties up NOTHING. How can you call that an ending!?!<br /><br />Total waste of time. Do yourself a favor and at least wait until the next book comes out. I'm VERY suspicious that the author's \\"jumping the shark\\" in the last 50 pages is foreshadowing of Matrix-like destruction of a good yarn in part two and beyond.<br /><br />You've been warned!!

I would buy this DVD if it only had the movie and nothing else. Neil Patrick Harris is funny and sings great...as does the entire cast.  I hope there will be more from them all very soon.  What a small treasure this short musical is to find.  Kudos to everyone involved.
B00134XIYM|5.0|this is a deadbang 5 star album...no ifs ans or butts...just stunning.  The best collection of songs about heartache from a female singer songwriter since Joni Mitchells \\"blue\\". The version reviewed is the BEST BUY version with a bonus DVD.  The bonus DVD has a very cool EPK (electronic Press Kit) with a background on Amy and some really great performances of a group of songs with Amy only accompanied by acoustic guitar ...which really allows the songs to shine and her voice as well.  I recommend this version highly!
0312330871|5.0|In And then there were none, ten unaquainted people are lured out to an island under false pretenses. Upon arriving, they learn their mysterious host, a U.N. Owen has not yet arrived. In fact, they soon discover their host will not arrive. Through the use of a gramophone a recording plays accusing the ten people of certain crimes from their past.<br /><br />One by one the stranded visitors begin to drop like flies. The question is, who this elusive U N Owens and why have these ten random people been chosen as victims? The ending wasn't as shocking as in Murder on the Orient Express, but I still managed to remain somewhat in the dark until the end. Although, I had my suspicions, which turned out to be accurate!<br /><br />A word of caution, if you haven't read this novel, don't read too many reviews. Some of them, in my opinion, reveal too much information.  It's best to read an Agatha Christie novel with as little clues as possible. If you haven't read it yet, read Murder on the Orient Express, but don't scroll all the way down the page to read any reviews on Amazon. Someone thought it would be cute to reveal the identity of the murderer as the subject of their review.
B001CJJWWA|5.0|lets ignore the fact that she is a mess of a human being....when it comes to art and music she is amazing!  This is a hi-def version of the DVD already out in the US...and it of course looks better in hi-def but the big reason I ordered this UK import (which plays fine on my Sony player) is the bonus concert NOT included on the domestic DVD and it is worth it to me to pay a bit of a premium for the bonus content as well as the sonic and picture upgrade.  recommended
0307277887|5.0|I have a book review blog through blogspot called \\"Between the Covers\\" that reviewed this book on February 23, 2009:    Darkly Dreaming Dexter, by Jeff Lindsay    The basis for Showtime's Emmy nominated \\"Dexter,\\" that just previously finished its third season, is this wonderfully original series by Jeff Lindsay.  You've seen cat-and-mouse mystery thrillers before, but none like this from a truly unique point of view.    Dexter Morgan, a blood-splatter forensic analyst for the Miami police department, goes above and beyond to catch the bad guy.  If there is not enough evidence to catch the murderer and put him behind bars for good, Dexter takes care of it himself.  However, Dexter's secret is not that he is a superhero; Dexter Morgan is a serial killer.  Here's the catch, he only kills the bad guys.  He fakes a normal life with his girlfriend Rita and his cop sister Deborah, but things become more complicated when a series of murders start to mimic Dexter's method.  As a child, Dexter was found on a brutal crime scene where his mother was murdered.  The officer on scene, Harry, became Dexter's foster father, but it wasn't long before Harry started to see the beginnings of Dexter's dark side.  Instead of kicking that badness out, Harry trained Dexter to have a conscience and only get those that the law could not get by itself.  He was also trained to never get caught.  When this new series of murders seems to be sending messages directly to Dexter that only he can see, it seems that someone might know what Dexter does as a hobby.  But with Harry dead who could possibly know besides Dexter?  Could it be that Dexter's training and wiring has blown and he no longer only kills bad guys and just doesn't know it yet?  He better find out quickly when those close to him start becoming targets.  The only way to do this is to figure out more about his past before Harry found him at the crime scene and confront that buried past.    In his first book to the series, Jeff Lindsay brilliantly introduces a new point of view that has rarely been seen in literature, that of the serial killer mastermind.  He makes it easy to fall for the killer even though Dexter is emotionless and fakes everything to the real world.  There is also a fine bunch of characters to interact with in this way, his girlfriend Rita who might be as damaged as him, his foster-sister Deborah desperately trying to move from vice to homicide, a perverted lab forensic lab partner, a female lieutenant constantly flirting with him, and a Sergeant Doakes who may be the only one that suspects Dexter is more than what he seems.  The fantastic way Lindsay gets his readers into the head of this serial killer is more than enough to make you enthusiastic for the rest of his series.  And the fact that the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly, and each new clever step blows your mind, will keep you flipping through the pages so fast you are in danger of a paper cut.    I would strongly recommend this book as well as Season One of Showtime's \\"Dexter\\" that follows the same plotline.  I am a big fan of this book series for its constant originality in a popular genre where that rarely seems the case.    \\"It is not true we have only one life to love, if we can read, we can live as many lives and as many kinds of lives as we wish.\\"    - S.I.

B001EN71HC|5.0|I enjoyed this series of films very much. The &#34;Goldmember&#34; film a bit less but overall a very creative and funny pop culture feast! One of the big bonus's for me anyway is to finally have the original Austin Powers movie in the proper 2:4 aspect ratio after years of having to watch it on 1:85 on normal DVD. This may not mean much to some viewers but to those interested in seeing what they did at the theater it does. The other two films came out in proper 2:4 aspect ratio on DVD previously so why the original was formatted a bit off was always a mystery to me.  The films look great on Blu-ray ...and while they don't have any NEW bonus features to my notice..at least they did import all the old ones and music videos (some blu-rays are coming out WITHOUT the previous bonus features). I picked the set up for a price that came to about $15 per film so I think its a very good value.   UPDATE.... Amazon.com is using a review of mine from a previous set for this one.... well, to answer another's comment.. it's a crazy good deal compared to what I paid a few years ago, but BR prices have been dropping as fast as one can say &#34;another Laker loss&#34; ...in the last couple of years.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|John Mayer has really matured since his first breakout in 2003?? The music on this cd is really outstanding ... different genres (blues, jazz, rock) without putting the listner in a totally different mood.    Buy this one- you won't be sorry.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|My hubby and I just happened to sit down and start watching this last night after having gone to the films for a date since our toddler had just finally gotten to sleep and we ended up staying up and watching all 4 57 minute episodes as we have this as part of the Elizabeth Gaskell collection.  It was THAT good.  Richard Armitage's Thornton, as someone else mentions, just smolders on the screen - his deep, soul-piercing looks at the actress that plays Margaret just sent thrills up my spine.  The story is very much a Pride and Prejudice type tale, with some reversals - Thornton has Darcy's pride and reserve and is misunderstood by the 'Lizzie' type - Margaret - in some ways, but unlike P and P, he is the one who is socially 'below' Margaret, who is a gentleman's/parson's daughter, and the daughter of a member of the nobility/society, and has lived amongst the social belles of London.  Margaret has not been exposed before going to the industrial town of Milton to the extreme poverty and dreariness of the early booming industrial revolution, and the exposure/comparison to that environment compared to the idyllic countryside and flower-filled scenery around her beloved parsonage home of Hellstone are a shock to her and her mother.    Margaret, however, is a strong, independent woman, the equal in many ways to the temperament and strength of Thornton, though his violent treatment of one of his employees repels and shocks her when they first meet, and sets the stage for her hate which eventually turns to love.  The proposal scene is also very much like Austen's between Darcy and Elizabeth.  I have not read the novel so cannot compare to how this production differs from Gaskell's book, but I have loved all the Gaskell novel adaptations by the BBC and so far this is over and above my favorite, as the love story is so engrossing alongside the historical details of the early cotton mills.  The sets and costumes are also amazing, as well as the acting by the rest of the cast,particularly the lady who plays Thornton's mother - incredible.  Really, top notch all the way.

B001JNNDBA|5.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie, being a bit skeptical given the general description. There is a bit of Memento in this, but not quite as twisty. Jake G. does a great job, as does the supporting cast. The screenplay was very tightly written, with few (any?) inconsistencies or plot holes that I could identify. In the end, everything ties together very nicely.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|I really liked this movie.  I am not usually a fan of Jolie, however she did a good job with this.  Based on a true story, it is amazing that so much corruption was rampant back in the 1920's.    Worth watching.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|[[ASIN:B0010VD7EO Oracular Spectacular]]    Purchased as a new, sealed product.  Product was exactly as expected and worked perfectly.      The songs in the CD, for the most part, are more than decent.  I was attracted to this CD from the songs played from the movie \\"21\\". There were a number of rumors about how good the band is, so I thought I gave it a shot.  I'm fairly happy with the band and the songs, although this is, by no means, not an album of the year.

B0004Z33EQ|3.0|My initial complaint about First Blood was that with all the buzz and word \\"classic\\" thrown about about it, I expected innovative, genre-defining violence hardly seen at the time.  I did not receive that.<br /><br />Just a few years later, with \\"First Blood II\\", the first movie to bear the \\"Rambo\\" tag, I get exactly the sort of \\"genre-defining violence\\" I had expected from the first movie.<br /><br />It still pales in comparison to modern bloodfests, but it's still something I haven't seen in many pre-80s movies, and even bloodier than most PG13 action movies today.<br /><br />From a Saga point of view, this installation was necessary to establish Rambo's skills, particularly with a bow and with pain tolerance.  From a story point of view, it was cheeseballs.  Majorly cheeseballs.<br /><br />The plot involves Rambo being taken out of prison for his crimes in the first movie, and sent to Vietnam for a redemptive act in which he must free a prisoner of war or a few.  For a veteran of old action films, the casting of Stacey Keach probably should have made it obvious that the commander in charge would eventually become the bad guy, but it took me a few scenes before realizing that.<br /><br />So Stacey Keach's character betrays Rambo for a reason which is highly logical and rational, and yet unlike most trashy action movies, the motives and justifications for it, despite being very mature and thoughtful, are nevertheless wrong and not worth abandoning Rambo and a prisoner of war or two.<br /><br />The story itself does feel like a cheeseball re-playing of the Vietnam war, with \\"America\\" winning in the form of the basic soldier, winning out against both communist enemies, and their own leaders who sent them to a pointless war to begin with.<br /><br />The parting words of Rambo at the end are very corny in the context of the plot, but I think out of context from this plot, they create yet another layer of profoundity and beauty to this insanely complex character.  It probably should have been included in \\"First Blood\\", but it is certainly not out of place here.<br /><br />\\"The war and all this may be wrong, but, dammit don't hate your country for it.\\"<br />\\"Hey... I'd die for it.\\"<br />\\"Then what do you want?\\"<br />\\"I want... what they want. And every other guy that came over here and gave everything he had and spilled his guts wants. For our country to love us, as much as we love it. That is what I want.\\"<br /><br />EDIT: I don't think that guy was played by Stacey Keach, actually.it is certainly not out of place here.    \\"The war and all this may be wrong, but, dammit don't hate your country for it.\\"   \\"Hey...

B00129H7VS|5.0|What a fabulous reminder that freedom is not free.  It's a fascinating thing to hear from the guys who were there and survived.  Whether you were in the military or not, you'll want to stand up and salute these great men!  You'll wish that you could thank them for their service and be amazed at their humility. It's must own if you like war films.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers is a brilliant look at the overlooked factors of success. It was no secret that luck often played a factor in what society deems a successful career or life, but one's birthyear or cultural or linguistic legacy is not usually considered in playing a factor in success, especially in a culture which believes in hard work and creating one's own destiny. From an explanation of the cultural factors in plane crashes to the Asian superiority in math over its western counterparts to the creation of the computing industry, Gladwell discusses a wide array of unconnected topics, each persuadingly and clear. In short, Gladwell's book breaks new ground and is just as entertaining to read and well researched as his previous two books. This is an important book in understanding the successes or failures of not only your life, but of those around you as well.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|First thoughts...:0 My god. This movie is amazing! Definately in my Top 10. Even if it's from 1987, it's hand's down the best vampire movie ever made. Here's the breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Directing--The directing is amazing from Joel Schumacher (St. Elmo's Fire). He has real talent behind the camera.<br />2.  Script--Very good writing. It's funny and scary at the same time. It also has some of the best movie characters ever.<br />3.  Acting--The acting is top-notch. You got an all-star cast including my favorite actor Kiefer Sutherland. You also have Jason Patric, the late Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, and Jami Gertz. Excellent acting from the entire cast.<br /><br />Now for the content review.<br />Rated R<br /><br />1.  Sex/Nudity=2/10. There is a sex scene in the movie, but there is no nudity.<br />2.  Violence/Gore=9/10. This movie is pretty violent. There is a lot of blood when the vampires are killed. The is one part when a vampire's body explodes, and it is pretty graphic.<br />3.  Language=4/10. There is not a lot of language. A couple S-words and other profanities. No F-words.<br /><br />Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. It is very, very good. It's in my Top 10 favorite movies of all time. It is also, in my opinion, the best vampire movie ever made. Highly recommended to fans of horror and vampires.
0765316897|5.0|\\"The Hero of Ages\\" is a great end to the \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy. It has a right balance of action and philosophy, just a little bit of romance and enough surprising plot twists to keep the reader constantly on the edge. As expected, in this novel Brandon Sanderson explains all the mysteries and ties all the knots. Well, almost all. The reader is left with just enough to ponder and think about future fate of the heroes. Even though the ending was not the one I anticipated, I liked it, as it is the most plausible and realistic. Anyway, as realistic, as fantasy gets.    By the end of the second book, the world of mists looked doomed. Constantly falling ashes, mists that kill people, dark forces that were getting more and more powerful... I felt the depression and frustration of the heroes and wondered with them, whether there is any hope. And I am glad, that Brandon Sanderson found the way out of \\"gloom and doom\\". \\"The Hero of Ages\\" is a good reading, and not only because it takes your mind of current affairs. But when you eventually get back to the reality, finishing the last page, you should be able to put current affairs into right perspective.     For the fantasy fans who haven't read the first two books, I highly recommend picking up \\"Final Empire\\" and then \\"Well of Ascension\\". This trilogy is one of the best fantasy series that were published lately.   Till recently, I was unaware that Brandon Sanderson was asked to complete the last book in \\"Wheel of time\\" enlogy by R. Jordan. However, after reading \\"Mistborn\\", I have no doubt that he is up to this task.
0307454894|5.0|I haven't read the book, but just saw the movie on the eve of the Oscars and have been more affected by this more than any other movie of my life I think.  Its grey-shaded ambiguity really made me philosophically ponder the complexities presented and all night my subconscious wrestled with theme and meaning until in the morning I awoke with an insight (as so often happens in that alpha/theta twilight zone).  Don't we all place people in a burning church sometimes and lock the doors?  Didn't Michael effectively do that to Hannah in the end?    \\"What would you have done?\\"  Hannah asks her judge in one of the most poignant sentences of the movie, referring to her assiduously carrying out the responsibilities of her \\"job\\".   I ask myself, what would I do if someone I loved only as deeply as one can love one's first love and the one who has exquisitely introduced one to the world of sex and the heart, if I discovered that the beloved had committed a heinous crime?  How would I feel about that person and about myself in my capacity to love someone who could commit mass murder by action and by neglect?    Beyond the generational German themes mentioned in other reviews, the practical consideration of issues deeper than forgiveness, victim, victimizer, guilt emerge:  How does compassion for self and the other manifest in this complex story of heart opening and closing and opening and closing?  Visually I am imprinted with the eloquence of Hannah's mute head shakes in the bathtub after the anguish and argument of the trolley scene. Do you forgive me?  Do you hate me?  Do you love me?  Wow.  A hurting human emerges.  Second visual:  Hannah, lover of words, is moved to tears, her head on her young lover's chest, nourished beyond food, sex, surroundings to her very soul by beauty of language which she herself cannot decipher nor express as it appears on paper.    What kind of colossal shame chooses 18 years in prison over the admission that one cannot read nor write?  .  .  .and suffers the injustice of suffering for 5 others who happily pile all the blame and hatred on a woman who is innocent of the particular if not the general accusations of degree of murderous responsibility?  This shame apparently shapes every aspect of her life.    In all other parts of the trial, Hanna was guilessly honest. She was uber-responsible to both her job as ticket-taker and her job of guard -true macabrely so for the latter.  What values in what order of priority brought her to the point of participating willingly in the excruciatingly painful deaths of at least 300 human beings?  Who can say from the perspective of one's own different life what Hanna should have done?  She acted from the life she had lived.    Why did Hanna hang herself?  I think Michael rekindled the possibility that she mattered to somebody.  But he couldn't offer her an unmixed compassion, particularly without some sign that she had \\"learned\\" from her \\"mistake\\" and its consequences.  For Hanna to encounter compassion mixed with something akin to revulsion when her unexamined mind had so simply lived out the punishment that was meted to her, must have been more than she could bear to see in her former-lover's face.  She took it into herself and took herself out of it all, finally.  Gave herself that absolution at least.    Visually I wonder what was the meaning of the contrast of the very opulent apartment of the Holocaust survivor with the sparse, closet-sized cell of Hanna - with its magazine cutouts of flowers taped to the wall by her bed?  What about the survivor's statement that the camps were not a place where learning took place --- as the prison was not a place for Hannah to learn anything either, except to read?  She served her time with a good chunk of her life -warm, fed and clothed it is true but ongoingly horrific all the same no doubt.  Beyond the Absolute where forgiveness does not even need to exist, there is the Relative, where accountability plays out.  It seems tome no human could do more penance than Hannah did for herself and five others and maybe Germany at large.  And what, after all, did Michael learn from his experience?  Perhaps that he was a distancer who withheld love.  I expect, however that he absorbed those traits from his parents more than from his experience with Hanna.  I'm sure he learned from her some things his family of origin could never have taught him.    I look forward to reading the book for the possibility that I might gain more insight into the inner workings of the characters than a purely visual portrayal of this story, albeit by the most extraordinary of actors, can give.
1400082773|5.0|This autobiography is one of the most well-written and moving books I have ever read. President Obama's early voice clearly resonates on themes of world race relations and his growth as an individual in understanding how he fits in. His words suggest a youthful unease that show his passion in helping the current condition of African Americans and Africans. For example, while reading a book on Africa's brilliant history and recent internecine struggles, Obama notes his feeling of restlessness: \\"I set the book down, feeling a familiar anger flush through me, an anger all the more maddening for its lack of a clear target\\" (p. 300).    While Obama's themes may suggest resentment and vitriol as a next step, he does not go down that path. He never speaks ill towards others throughout the book; instead, his words are objective, with criticism directed only towards his own African American community.    Obama's focus and drive really shine in this book as well, showing his upward drive through Columbia University, his dedication in helping out the Chicago community, and his acceptance into Harvard law school.    There are only a few negatives about this book. While the writing is eloquent, a few passages were really drawn out. The latter chapters about Kenya, while compelling, are long, and the many introduced names in his extended family are a bit exhausting to read. Also, I wish Obama had written more about his study habits and his scholarly activities that got him into Columbia and Harvard. There is only a minor event, noted in passing on page 324, that says he was \\"always spending time with books.\\"     Overall, an excellent autobiography.

0060920084|2.0|I've read and enjoyed other Bryson books, but this one was just not that funny. I feel sorry that some people who have never visited the US might read this and think we are a nation of Crudvilles. Bryson cracks on Beaufort SC because it's made up of retirees and military. So? I didn't know he disliked military families so much. I can tell by his anti-conservative attacks early on, but I don't understand this. He keeps telling us how cheap his father was, but he rants at the admission fees and evidently stays at cheap motels (pool tables with sheets for beds). The book has Small Town in the title but he visits Dearborn, New York City, DC, etc. It has its funny moments but overall I was left at the end thinking, \\"What DOES he like?\\"
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Who wants to be \\"City of God?\\" \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" that's who. While this film is done well and has obvious differences, still, it is just \\"City of God\\" done in India. The most interesting parts are the actual story itself. The Who Want's to be a Millionaire parts are just as annoying as the actual show. Essentially this is a Cinderella story with the boy as the star. This still is a good film but since i have already seen \\"City of God\\" it is hard to get that film out of my mind while watching this. In \\"City of God\\" the protagonist uses his wits and photography to escape the slums to a decent and realistic life. This film is a bit more over the top with it's vehicles for delivering Jamal out of the slums. This film also heavily pushes fate as the driving force of nature behind everything. \\"City of God\\" just shows good old fashioned good luck and someone relying on their wits. Money is not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in \\"City of God\\" either. To me, the money in this film and the TV show aspect of it lessened it's appeal some and took away some from the film. 4 our of 5 stars. Go  see \\"City of God\\" and \\"Cinema Paradiso\\". \\"Slumdog owes much to those 2 films.

0061537934|2.0|I'm a dog lover and I enjoy racing. So, I thought this might be a great read. But, sorry to say, this was predictable, almost as if if was written for a college level creative writing class.    Maybe I'm getting old and cynical, but it seems that many books and movies are formulaic. Kinda like an ad-lib where the author fills in blanks.  [Protagonist] is [married to / engaged to / living with] [female name] and then wife [dies / divorces / decides she's gay] and is no longer in the picture. [Protagonist] has a hobby that the author is interested in and can drop a few names and facts that would entice readers.    Alas, in this book it is the same stuff.  Yep, the BMW 2002 is a great little car.  And yep it seems that a dog's sense of small can distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. But that doesn't add much to the characters--they are just tidbits that are added to no great effect (kinda like adding a single bay leaf to spaghetti sauce).    And the characters are one dimensional.  They are added to get a single effect.  But real people are not one dimensional--they are filled with emotions and contradictions.    So, I don't recommend it.

This season is great--hints are finally given to the mother's identity, and the story moves forward.  Barney's character in particular grows so much and it's amazing seeing NPH's acting get better and better in each episode.

B00078XGRO|2.0|Widely considered to be the best movie featuring the 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' cast but that's like comparing a Whopper and a Quarter Pounder: They're familiar, kinda' tasty, but all are ultimately mediocre experiences you're soon to forget.     The  movie is a perfect example of studio executive logic: Some of the highest rated episodes of the series had the Borg so they have to be in it. Then the highest grossing Star Trek movie up to that point had time travel which was also popular during the series. I know! Make a movie with the Borg and time travel! What you end up watching is a contrived mess that only scarcely resembles what you fell in love with on the small screen. The plot, sprinkled with heavy-handed hammy humor, is a self-congratulatory romp through Star Trek history that moves so briskly even the plot holes can't keep up. Worst of all, 'First Contact' marked the beginning of the \\"stupidification\\" of the Borg. The scary metaphor of relentless cultural conformity and the embodiment of our techy fears were replaced by what essentially amounts to zombies. From outer space. Then there's the explicable but out-of-character, and doubly-contrived Picard-with-an-Ahab-complex that drives the movie. Simply lazy. Just like the notion that all ships can now travel through time at will. No goofy \\"temporal anomolies,\\" wormoholes, or slingshots around the sun. Just make it so!      The movie is not a total loss. It is fun to see your \\"family\\" again even though they all don't act like you remember, and the peformances of James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard are good. The movie has more heart than its subsequent soul-less sequels and it is a decent superficial Star Trek adventure; albeit one with nothing to say. Star Trek stopped commenting on the events of the day or cultural matters and decided to sell out to the lowest common denominator. 'First Contact' represents a continuing slide into mediocrity and irrelevance that ultimately doomed the franchise. It's okay,it's watchable, you might even enjoy it. But the line should've been drawn here.
B001M4YZ90|1.0|I was expecting so much out of this film, but after viewing it, i was tempted to throw it in the garbage. First off, this movie is long, dull, full of british slang, which is not a problem as long as the movie is good. Bad, bad flick, i really don't understand the good reviews of this film. I am not ebert, but i can sure tell the difference from a bad movie and a good one, and yeah, this is a bad one.
0066620996|5.0|An excellent book for everyone who wants to understand what it takes to strive for excellence.   Recommended for all!
B000SZPXC2|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. Great cast and well written. The editing is not the best but the writing makes up for it. It is a must see if you like non Hollywood movies.

0307387178|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I live in Fairbanks, Alaska and am very familiar with Stampede Trail where Christopher McCandless died.  I am a Clinical Social Worker/Marriage and Family Therapist who provided therapy for residents of the town of Healy, adjacent to Stampede Trail.<br /><br />This is a very well-written book about Chris McCandless (self-named Alexander Supertramp) who traveled off the Stampede Trail near Healy, Alaska and died - though a a safe river crossing and 3 cabins were less than 6 miles away.  He wandered into the wild without any preparation - not enough food, gear, or clothes to see him through any length of time.<br /><br />Krakauer analyzes McCandless's family of origin, his intent to live by Emersonian and Thoreau-like ideals.  However, what he fails to take stock of is the fact that McCandless was likely mentally ill and quite possibly delusional.  This was not merely some adolescent adventure but a series of poor decisions by somebody who had lost sight of what is rational.<br /><br />I recommend the book because it makes for such good reading but I encourage the reader to challenger Mr. Krakauer's outcome by analyzing the evidence for themselves.<br /><br />Two great books about Alaska that I recommend for anyone who is interested in Alaska are [[ASIN:0979047064 Cold Starry Night (New Edition)]] by Claire Fejes and [[ASIN:1571310479 Ordinary Wolves: A Novel]] by Seth Kantner.
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|With a very slow moving story, we are brought through the beginnings of what some may view of how the CIA developed in the first few decades.  Matt Damon does an excellent job portraying a very quiet, somewhat cold hearted man who gets recruited by the CIA while studying at Yale.<br /><br />We have a number of flashbacks and forwards that you must keep an eye on to make sure you know where you are.  Interestingly developed as a story, you see one man's life influenced by what he does for the company.  Although a very interesting story, there are messages you see in the movie.  One is a scene where someone is wearing one of the infamous hoods from the Abu Gharib tortures, this is supposed to be 1959 or 1960, so, the message here is that this type of thing has been common since then.<br /><br />Interesting things include the development of the character played by Damon through the beginnings with WWII and the relationship with the spy networks in England.<br /><br />The play of Damon and his colleagues, the intrigue, the distrust and the final culmination of his work.  The Good Shepherd plays as a metaphor of sorts, reflecting how one man's life applies to the beginnings and development of the agency.
B000ZN802W|1.0|What? So, we're supposed to feel sorry for this selfish boy who decides to take off abandoning family and friends and can't even call to tell them he's okay. On top of that he thinks it would be a great idea to go live in the wilds of Alaska without any knowledge of the environment or how brutal \\"living with nature\\" truly is.   Sorry, I don't see the beauty in selfishness.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|Body of Lies is a very strong title for this movie, however, you are trying to sift through the action to find out whom is lying to whom.<br /><br />We are taken to Iraq, Jordan, Dubai and elsewhere as we see DiCaprio, a CIA operative working for Russel Crowe who is operating from the US and is the head of Middle East operations.  It is as if we are on the ground with the front line of offence and intelligence in the War on Terror.<br /><br />DiCaprio at one point asks a Muslim about his hatred for the Crusaders.  What is poinant about that is that few movies and news stories use that word, which extremists use to stir up anger at the West.  Where Scotts 'Blackhaw Down' focused on a battle and was more of macro view of a battle and a micro view of the fighters, Body of Lies is an even closer micro look from a day to day, individual level of what he sees as the War on Terror.<br /><br />Crowe has a southern twang, gained weight for this role and looks like he was having fun mocking an uncaring character.  DiCaprio is very involved and you get the feeling he is in this work for all the right reasons.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the interplay between DiCaprio and the Jordanians and Crowe.  I have visited Jordan in the past and they are very friendly towards Americans and America in general.  However, there is a powerplay of sorts going on as the US attempts to find the mastermind and influence behind bombings in the West.<br /><br />Well worth the time to view and own.  Get 'Body of Lies' for your DVD library.
B000002A46|5.0|I hadn't listened to this album in entirety for a long time but found a lot of comfort in listening to it during this past holiday season and have been listening to certain tracks off and on since.<br /><br />Honestly I bought it back when it was released but truly only listened to my favorite track, O HOLY NIGHT over & over.  This is a well-balanced album that mixes standard holiday songs with Mariah's own heartfelt tracks which makes it an interesting album overall to listen to.<br /><br />SILENT NIGHT - I love the vocal arrangement of the background singers, Melonie Daniels, Shanrae Price & Kelly Price<br /><br />ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU - instant modern classic with a do-wop arrangement<br /><br />MISS YOU MOST (AT CHRISTMAS TIME) - although I love this track, I can't listen to it too often as it brings me to tears<br /><br />JOY TO THE WORLD - love her rollicking rendition of this traditional song<br /><br />JESUS BORN ON THIS DAY - Mariah sounds great & the addition of the childrens' choir makes this song special<br /><br />SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN - another toe-tapping rollicking arrangement kicks up the \\"fun factor\\" of this song<br /><br />HARK! THE HERALD ANGEL SINGS/GLORIA - the arrangement is terrific<br /><br />JESUS, OH WHAT A WONDERFUL CHILD - takes me to church everytime I hear it<br /><br />It's one of the best holiday albums I have in my collection and definitely one of my favorite Mariah albums.
B001JNNE64|5.0|\\"Amadeus\\" is truly one of the greatest films of all time and one of the greatest I've ever seen. I haven't seen the film since I was a child and now it's available on Blu Ray which I had the great pleasure of purchasing for only $15. \\"Amadeus\\" never looked better and since it's the Director's Cut, the entire movie is gloriously presented in high definition. The 1080p transfer is fantastic and the audio is superb. The nice thing about this package is that it comes in a Blu Ray Book which is what it is, a book. When you open it you see the movie disc on the inside cover followed by pages on photos and commentary on the film. On the inside back cover is a special CD Compilation of Mozart's music. The movie disc also features a one hour \\"Making Of\\" documentary, which I don't remember being on any other DVD release.<br /><br />The film itself is extraordinary. The story tells of composers Antonio Salieri (played by F. Abraham Murray) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by Tom Hulce). Salieri is a self-proclaimed rival of Mozarts and is deadly envious of Mozart's talent. He absolutely loves Mozart's work but hates that Mozart has the talent and he doesn't. The story chronicles their story as colleagues in Vienna and Mozart becomes a star as Salieri's popularity wanes leading to the end of the film where Mozart dies and Salieri blames himself for it. The film is beautifully shot with gorgeous sets and costumes and the ever so amazing music of Mozart. F. Abraham Murray puts on an amazing performance in which his Oscar was well deserved.<br /><br />Overall, if you haven't seen \\"Amadeus\\", go out and get it, whether you buy or rent it. You have to see it. For Blu Ray owners, definitely get this one while it's on sale. It's a must have for true lovers of film.
B000WOV9AO|5.0|Big fan of Mr. Winwood & Co. Looking to add to my collection and needed this gem.  Love it -*****
B00005YW4H|5.0|WOW is all I can say! I'm still recovering from the face-melting riffs from this death metal album. Norah Jones is a true metal goddess, along with Jewel and Enya. Her songs are angry, you can tell by her screams and the pounding of the drumming. Check this out if you truly want to \\"rock out\\"- trust me she's better and HEAVIER than Slayer/Anthrax/Burzum/Bathory/Cannibal Corpse/Immortal/etc.
159448385X|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I certainly didn't think another of Khaled Hosseini's books could be as good as Kite Runner, but it is.  It gives you wonderful insight to the pathetic existence women in that part of the world have.  It was a compelling novel that kept me reading and reading- to the point where I wasn't doing anything else!  I could not put it down!  I felt the women's pain and sorrow- I cried and hurt with them.  You have got to read this book! It is life changing and it stays with you. Very bittersweet.  I loved it.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This was simply a nice human-interest story.    Basically, it's about a likeable Irish family which immigrates to the United States and resides in New York City. These are poor people, but not the destitute situation of, let's say, the McCourt family from \\"Angela's Ashes.\\"    What stood out to me were the nice, cute little girls in this family, played by real-life sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger. They were the kind of sweet kids you wish you'd see more of in modern films. Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton played the parents, \\"Johnny and Sarah\\" nicely and Djimon Hounson played the nice neighbor with the strange powers.  Overall, it's a pleasant, positive feel-good film. I've watched it several times and enjoyed it more each time!
B000A6T262|5.0|THIS is a GREAT DVD set as each movie has a 2nd dvd with director/producer information about making the movies, including the music by Jerry Goldsmith! As a Trekkie, I can appreciate the movies much more with this extra information and interviews. THIS IS THE SET TO GET FANS!!
B0013FDM7E|3.0|Well, this certainly was entertaining. It's no award winner, but it's involving. The hour-and-a-half goes by pretty fast, and gets you into the plight of the main character, so I give it four stars for that.    I can't say the story is anything special, or particularly intelligent. The theme of few people left on the planet, a kind of \\"Planet Of The Ape\\" type tale, is nothing new. This one just has a few different twists to it and, film-wise, is different in that it features computerized special-effects. As one who normally enjoys those visual treats, I would rate this aspect \\"fair,\\" too, like the story.    Early on, the animals racing down New York City streets looked very fake. Later, the effects were a little better with the zombies, but nothing that would make you drop your jaw in amazement.    Like the story and FX, Will Smith as the lead character was okay: good, but not Oscar material. Actually, I thought the German Shepherd did the best job of acting in the film!    Having said all that, I still enjoyed the film and recommend it iff you are looking for suspense, some scary scenes and a good diversion in your life for 91 minutes.   Just know what you're getting: this is very horror-like in many spots. It's a tense story.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I have endlessly been exposed to this hapless album in my workplace for several months now. I still can't remember most of the songs and those that I do remember are not the sort of thing I'd ever wish to commit to memory. I have a limited amount of space on the harddrive between my two ears and I'd rather not waste any space on memories of music like this.<br /><br />Coldplay have spent a lot of money on an album that is generally lacking in every area. It is shameful that the great Brian Eno was involved in the recording of this album. I guess that it proves that if one has enough money, anyone can be bought.<br /><br />Expect to hear this music in shopping centres and malls, in TV/radio commercials for jeans other \\"lifestyle\\" goods and as background music in petrol stations and junk food joints.<br /><br />My only hope is that the members of Coldplay are forced to listen to their own album over and over again.
0783114893|4.0|The first time I saw this movie it just about terrified me....and few films have ever done that to me as an adult. Rutger Hauer was haunting as the demented killer.    The film moves very fast in this story of a maniac stalking a young motorist (C. Thomas Howell). Two subsequent viewings have quieted the fear but it's still a very chilling film and should keep most people riveted to the screen. It's an hour- and-a-half that will fly by with action and suspense.....and horror (see the headline here for one of those horrific moments).    On the negative side, not once but twice we have to watch Howell vomit. Neither he nor female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh are likable \\"good guys.\\" (Of course, when has Leigh ever been a \\"good person\\" on screen?) The police, as usual in films, are pictured as sadistic, short-tempered idiots. Finally, credibility gets stretched a bit, particularly in the last 30 minutes.    But, overall, it will be a film that will get your attention, beginning with Mr. Hauer, whom you will never forget.
0307276902|1.0|This book became famous, or infamous, when it was discovered to be a lie.  And it's not just a little lie, it's all a lie.  I have a difficult time understanding how this fiction could have been adopted and adored by Oprah and Co, by reviewers and editors all over the world, and by the great unwashed, without question.<br /><br />I speak as someone who lived half his life (much, much longer then James Frey) addicted to substances, went through treatment and recovery, and have nearly 20 years sobriety.  Frey's story is BS, and any honest person in recovery will instantly recognize it as such.  From the very first page, where he is put on an airplane, by a doctor, with a bleeding hole in his cheek (give me a break), until the very last, where he is \\"victorious\\" over a glass of booze, he weaves a not-so-clever and easily recognizable lie.  No treatment center exists, much less the Hazelden Center, where his fictional biography obviously took place, that treats addicts and alcoholics the way he describes.  No treatment center anywhere sends patients to the dentist for treatment without pain killers.  Did nobody even consider the fact that that zylocaine is injected locally and is not addictive?  Did nobody even consider the fact that no doctor would put multiple stitches in someone's cheek without a local anesthetic?  And most of all, did nobody recognize that James Frey is a typical BS artist who lives a lie in recovery?<br /><br />Frey's main thrust is that he did it himself, not with the help of AA, not with the help of God, or a sponsor, or anyone else.  I don't hold with the god/higher power part either, but if James Frey got clean and sober, he didn't do it alone.  Frankly I wonder if he really did get clean and sober, just as as I wonder whether he was even an addict. It's too bad he didn't stick to the truth.  He is a BS artist even if he is a somewhat talented writer.  Unfortunately for the reading public, his \\"story,\\" and the way he tells it, is common among a certain subset of people in recovery.  The world of recovery has a sadly large number of people like him.  And they share a characteristic beyond living a lie.  They invariably relapse, because the truth is not in them.  Those of us who have been there don't need to embellish.  It was bad enough in reality.<br /><br />The truly funny part is how Oprah and the rest swallowed it hook, line and sinker.  No wonder they got so angry.  It worked out well for me, though. I was able to buy a used copy for $1 because nobody wants it.  I found it to be a pretty good how-not-to primer on memoir writing.  Unfortunately, it may also convince addicts and alcoholics that they can be as tough as Jamey Frey and do it themselves.  I shudder to think how many people will suffer in their disease as a result.t of people in recovery.  The world of recovery has a sadly large number of people like him.

031606792X|4.0|I completely love the character's and their relationships in this book. (As with all the books) I would like to comment that while I understand that this saga was written for the young adult, I felt the writer used the same terminology over and over again. I would liked to have seen a little more creative ability in that area.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|My Korean girlfriend had told me about this movie, so I ordered it. It is a fantastic movie. Very well made, acted and filmed. The story is amazing with some unique twists. I heard they are going to remake this in America and Speilberg is directing? Why mess with an already great film? Well worth owning. Superfast shipping, product exactly as described.
B001PE26QQ|5.0|Modern martial arts films fall into two categories: the fantastical wuxia variety, with its flying swordsmen fighting off whole battalions while emitting chi blasts with their palms, and the more realistic variant that seeks to depict an actual human fighting at the peak of human potential. Ip Man is the latter, and quite probably the finest example of this type of kung fu movie.    Though Ip Man's life story is altered for dramatic effect and the fight scenes are cinematized, it is about as fine an example of wing chun applied to real life as has been seen on screen. Action choreographer Sammo Hung, who directed the previous three best screen renditions of wing chun (Prodigal Son, Warriors Two, and the Wing Chun TV/telenovella series repackaged as a feature length film Twin Dragons) shows that he has continued to deepen his understanding of wing chun as a real fighting art and how to combine it with the requirements of an exciting movie fight. The telenovella provides more of an explanation of wing chun strategy and mindset, but Ip Man undoubtedly flourishes due to the excellent (and superior) physical skills of its star.    With Donnie Yen in the title role, we see the portrait of perhaps the greatest wing chun practioner of the past 100 years, in his prime. We see wing chun as an art that stresses timing, efficiency, directness and the instantaneous exploitation of offensive opportunities as soon as they arise. Mentally, we see wing chun as an art that advocates a highly aggressive response in combat. Yen does a superb job as both actor and martial artist.    Certain events in the film purportedly have a basis in reality: Ip's challenge fight with a Northern stylist, a confrontation with a gun-welding police officer, and a request by the Japanese military to instruct Japanese troops. However, the end, which sees Ip escaping to Hong Kong, implies that Ip was fleeing the Japanese. In fact, Ip fled to Hong Kong to avoid the wrath of the victorious Communists: as a former member of the privileged class who had demonstrated some Nationalist sympathies, he rightly realized that he would have been an obvious target for \\"re-education\\" and imprisonment. It is obvious that this fact was downplayed to make the movie more palatable for the mainland Chinese market.    One amusing scene in the movie features Ip, the great master, nevertheless helpless before the wrath of his wife, who vents her frustration at his devotion to training and sparring. Thousands, if not millions, of male wing chun students have found themselves in the same situation with their wives and girlfriends, so it is comforting to see that even Ip Man could not find a way out of this quandary.
B0000214F0|4.0|What can I say. This movie is a classic, and is one \\"porn\\" movie that breaks the mold. Well known classical actors in a Roman tale of depravity, sex and power gone mad. Well acted, well cast and with high production values for this type of movie. Penthouse magazine Bob Guccione's lovechild of a movie. He spent tons of money on this one. Very interesting \\"true\\" story told with no inhibitions. Worth owning only the uncut edition.
045122499X|5.0|Received book and can't wait to begin reading. Had no problem with the transaction. Thank you.
B001HN6972|5.0|Surprisingly some of Amazon's synopsis is incorrect.  The book and film's main character is Michael Berg who at 15 in 1958, begins a summer affair with Hannah Schmitz, a woman twice his age.  There are so many layers of mystery to this story that I don't want to ruin it for anyone who has still not seen the film or read the book.  So I'll glide a bit over the story.  After Michael's heart is broken by Hannah's sudden disappearance, which is another mystery of the story, years pass, and Michael at 22 is studying law.  He is in a special seminar of law students studying German guilt over the Holocaust, taught by a professor who is concentration camp survivor.  They attend a war crimes trial where a group of women are accused of participating in a horrendous act.  As the names of the accused are read aloud, Michael is stunned when he hears the name of Hannah Schmitz.     What follows is a heartbreaking journey of love lost, conflicts of morality, non-redemption and how sometimes the expression sadder but wiser is an inadequate way of describing the end of an affair.    I was profoundly moved by this film and was very surprised by the mixed reviews it received.  Those critics who were negative to the film, just didn't get it.  Kate Winslet's amazing performance alone would be a reason to see the film.  The most neglected performance of the film was given by David Kross who plays the 15 and 22 year old Michael.  I was amazed to read that this young man was only 17 when he made the film.  He also learned English to make the film and his performance reaches deeply into the heart with skill and maturity.  Ralph Fiennes's performance as the adult Michael has a smaller role but nevertheless he leaves a deep impression and brings the story to its full circle and arc.    The film is well worth seeing (I've seen it twice) and I can't wait for the release on DVD.  The book which is barely 200 pages long, packs a wallop as well and is beautifully translated into English.
B0016AJU2C|4.0|Flavors of Entanglement is an enjoyable CD.  There are certainly high and low points, as with any Alanis CD - I love \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" and think it is her best, but even that disc had some pretty weak songs - but overall, pretty solid.    \\"Torch\\", however...well.  Much more than solid.  One of the best songs I have ever heard.  I've heard that it's about the \\"death\\" of her relationship with Ryan Reynolds, but it can be interpreted in several different ways, and any way you want to take it, it's amazing.  Without \\"Torch\\", I'd probably give this CD 3 stars...that song alone is worth an extra star.  Just incredible.  The piano, the plaintiveness of the verses, the raw emotion and power of the chorus...look, you need to listen to it.  Right now.  Seriously.  Stop reading this review and go listen to \\"Torch\\".
B0018AVNKC|3.0|Coraline is a nice film for young teens. The story is moderately interesting and quirky -- although the ending wraps up too quickly and too neatly, and has the feel of a \\"collect the items\\" video game. No matter. It provides a nice balance of creepy scares (that never get too creepy), irreverence (including an obese old lady with enormous breasts and pasties prancing about), and absolutely beautiful visuals (including a phantasmagorical tree frog that pops out of a pitcher plant).  Some of it might be a little to intense for the eight and under crowd -- including the threat of having needles thrust into your eyes -- but don't underestimate the ability of children to roll with the punches on this sort of thing.  Traditional fairy tales were just as gruesome, if not moreso.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I wanted another speedlight to add to my SB800's and I had qualms getting the SB900 because of reviews by users who did not bother to read the manual complaining about the thermal shutdown.  Yes, the automatic thermal shutdown which protects the SB900 from a meltdown which does not exist in the SB800.  If you are trigger happy and do not care whether or not your speedlight melts down, then just turn off that protection -- page C24 of the SB900 manual.  Also, it seems that the original firmware of the SB900 had the auto thermal shutdown settings having a narrow latitude or overly protective but has now been corrected in the latest firmware.  Well, at least those who have the SB900 do not have to buy a new unit, and only a firmware update is necessary, something that you couldn't do with an SB800 unit.  All in all, the SB900 is a superior model to replace an aging and obsolete SB800 and I'm glad I did not listen to those people who complained about the SB900 just because they did not read the manual. For those who are trying to buy a used SB800 unit for $500+, I have a couple I can sell so I could replace them with the $400 SB900.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|Ok. I wanted to see this so bad that I purchased it. This far I have really enjoyed all movie musicals that I have seen but I found this one to be lack luster. The songs, besides two, were not really rhythmic and the coreography did not wow (once more in exception to two.) I also did not like that every five minutes they broke into song- there was very little acting and alot of it was mediocre, the acting, the musical numbers and the vocalization/songs themselves. It had some good laughs- the comedy was the only thing that kept it alive in my book, but still getting through this film was not easy for me. I rate it a three because of its two highly coreographed and rhythmic songs and its comedic parts, otherwise I would have rated it a two. I really don't think this film is worth more than [...] bucks.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|World War 1 is now over and life goes on, but for many who survived the carnage complete recovery seems impossible. Jake Barnes is an American ex-soldier now working as a journalist in Paris. His days are spent at the typewriter diligently working, and much of the night is spent walking from bar to bar to caf&eacute;, enjoying the scenery and drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Jake's friend Robert Cohn is an apparently successful writer of novels but inside he longs to really live life. He longs to experience life as truly 'real.' According the Jake the problem with Cohn is that he only knows life from books. Now Cohn has read the \\"intensely romantic\\" book _The Purple Land_ and wants to go to South America because he is convinced that he will finally 'be alive' there. He wants Jake to come with him. Jake refuses and suggests, as an alternative, that Cohn come with him and his friend Bill Gordon on their annual trip to Pamplona in Spain. They will first spend a week fishing and then enjoy the fiesta for another week. Cohn agrees to come. Mean while Jake has run into Brett Ashley, an attractive, passionate woman who he has known since the war. Jake has a friendly but unhappy relationship with Brett as he cannot find a way to fully express his love for her. On hearing about the planned trip to Spain Brett asks if she and her current fianc&eacute; Michael can come too. Jack agrees. Mean while, however, Britt has a brief romantic liaison with Cohn. Despite this seemingly explosive web of relationships the partly sets out for Spain.<br /><br />Writing after the Second World War the Existentialist philosophers stressed the need for man to live 'authentically,' that is, not lying to oneself, not sleepwalking through life without truly experiencing it. _Fiesta_ in many ways prefigures those philosophic arguments. Who in the story truly lives, at least for a while? When is Jake most truly authentic? Closely allied with this theme of authenticity is the topic of triviality. How many drunken conversation can these characters, or the reader, stand? The first quarter of this book, while the characters are still in Paris, in fact becomes boring, but Hemingway has deliberately written it this way in order to make his point. During the crazy time of the fiesta the book truly takes off and it is easy to see how this story in many ways inspired the now booming tourist trade in Pamplona. Hemingway has vividly portrayed each of his characters, but the reader must ask himself do any of them change or grow? Why, or why not?<br /><br />This book was first published in 1927 and is Hemingway's first novel. It has been critically studied in some depth and acclaimed to a fair degree. If you enjoy reading this book you may also like his later works A Farewell To Arms (1929) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). In 1954 Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.nken conversation can these characters, or the reader, stand? The first quarter of this book, while the characters are still in Paris, in fact becomes boring, but Hemingway has deliberately written it this way in order to make his point. During the crazy time of the fiesta the book truly takes off and it is easy to see how this story in many ways inspired the now booming tourist trade in Pamplona. Hemingway has vividly portrayed each of his characters, but the reader must ask himself do any of them change or grow? Why, or why not?<br /><br />This book was first published in 1927 and is Hemingway's first novel. It has been critically studied in some depth and acclaimed to a fair degree.

B00001QGPS|5.0|This is a straight up classic rap album. Redman and Methodman are animals on this cd. They blend together perfectly. There are vey few cd's out there that I can listen from start to finnish evertime without wanting to skip a track and this is right up there. If you like energy and great rappers with sick lyrics then BUY THIS ASAP!!!!!
B001P9KR8U|2.0|This is absolutely absurd, it was true that Slumdog Millionaire was a good movie but people are getting hyped up on a movie that wasn't exceptional. It's sad yes but no where compared to movies like Benjamin Button, Frost/Nixon or even Doubt. Poor Oscar Choice this year.. (Just like they did with Crash)
B001J1O83E|5.0|The US version of this movie is a little different than the one released overseas (I specifically remember two fairly violent scenes that were edited out), but it's still amazing.  I remember watching the trailer in the theater and leaning over to my friends with a look of glee and amazement.  We all knew we were going to see that movie on opening night.    And we did.    It did not disappoint.    It takes a minute to get rolling, but I think it only felt that way because the movie is so short (I think it's about an hour and a half long).  It doesn't feel like very long, though, as, once the action starts, it blows you away.  It's quick, gritty camera angles that really make the film come alive.  Some of the violence is so out there, yet realistic, that you have to cringe when you watch it.    At it's heart, it's about a man, desperate to find and save his daughter, and willing to employ any means necessary to get her back.  As the title of this review suggests, it's a little like 24 - okay, a LOT (with one scene ripped straight out of day 5, fans will know what I'm talking about), the man's daughter's name is Kim and she's been kidnapped and he's gotta do crazy bad things to get her.  It's enough to hold me over until the real 24 movie is out, BUT, it's good enough in its own right.    I love Liam Neeson in this role, if only because I was surprised that he could pull it off.  I kept hearing Aslan as he was making death threats and it was a little disconcerting.  But he makes me believe he's Brian Mills in every second of the movie.  The only thing I didn't believe was that he and Lenor were ever married.  They just didn't click.  At all.  Maybe it's good that they divorced!    It's definitely worth the rent, but even more so, it's worth the buy.  I can't wait until it's released on DVD.
0743270754|5.0|This book was incredibly well researched and documented and written in a easy-to-read style. I highly recommend it!!!
0060794410|4.0|Strong book...the positives are outlined by other reviews here. I will say though that his reading -the audio version is read by Jim Collins- has a bombastic tone, and it feels like he is making a 'hard sell' on the methodological rigor of his work and the subsequent ideas. I'm surprised I'm not seeing other reviewers note this. I find myself cringing at his rhetoric and having to force myself to be open minded to his ideas because I feel he is trying to shove them down my throat. By the 4th CD you get over it, and really appreciate some of the stronger points he makes. The concept of a Level 5 leader is great, although I sense a lot of us buy into this concept out of simple admiration for leaders with those characteristics. He leaves plenty of food for thought.
0312383320|2.0|I love the outrageous Stephanie Plum books, but I was truly disappointed with this one.  It didn't make much sense.  Even the title didn't make much sense.  I was expecting something Hallowe'en themed, and instead it's a silly book about changing the weather and monkeys.  There are plenty of antics and Stephanie finds herself in lots of scapes.  And she loses another vehicle.  but the book just didn't make much sense at all.  We have Diesel back and that was something, but there's not much of Morelli or Ranger in this one.  I sure hope the next number book is better than this \\"between the numbers\\" book was.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is a refreshing perspective on your personal financial state and goals.
045122499X|5.0|WOW! A huge, monstrous, sprawling saga of a tale. . .full of almost every literary theme known to man. This is a type of book (along with it's wonderful predecessor, Pillars of the Earth) that captivatesyour attention and holds it until page 1114. It reads so quickly, as there are many great stories in it, and you'll be finished before knowing it, wishing that this world had no end.  I loved this book, and will reccomend it to anyone interested in reading a story about humble beginnings, and the historical genre.  This book also points out the greatest theme of karma, how hard work can pay off, A++++++
B00005U11Z|5.0|I will highly recommed making purchases from you to all my friends and co-workers.  Service was delivered with lightening speed and product was excellent shape.  Thank you for I am happy with purchase.        JIM
B00140PK6O|5.0|All I can say is that this is a simply fantastic series! I bought this on a whim and I'm so glad that I did! One of the best miniseries that I own. WATCH THIS! Each episode has you in stitches and tears. An incredible emotional ride and I commend everyone behind this production! It's just a beautifully-told tale! HIGHLY recommended.
006051065X|4.0|My 11 year old tutee loved this book. She found interest with each of the characters, found the descriptions captivating, and read it very quickly. We as adults have got to let kids read. Most of the time, they don't even catch the subtle themes that we do. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to see the movies.
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite non-fiction writers. I enjoyed  The Tipping Point and Blink more than this book. With that said, it's still a very interesting and entertaining read. I read it in two evenings and found it very stimulating.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Daygs of Glory/Indigenes would have been better served without the unnecessary Saving Private Ryan-esque ending, but it's still an interesting and well-directed war film that tells the story of characters we don't normally see fighting in WWII movies.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|Not bad if your into the Matrix series of movies. I really wished HD DVD and Blue Ray could co-exist but I personally can't tell the difference between the two formats. If you have an HD DVD player, get this as its graphics and quality is awesome. Personally if you have an HD DVD player, I would search near and far for HD DVD movies because of the clearance prices. After there are no more HD DVD movies left to buy in store or online, then move onto Blue Ray.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The perfect example of a failed film, Sunshine offers many interesting and well-imagined scenes and scenarios in its first half before finally collapsing under the weight of a ham-handed subplot with poorly-grafted on religious undertones (apparently the writer and director had competing visions); watch it if you like sci-fi, but expect a flawed product.
B001DP7S7Y|3.0|This is the German release of Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL.  Things you should know about this disc:  The menu is in German and the default language is German (although the English track is available).  The movie and the menu will play on a U.S. model PS3, but the extras will not, as they are PAL format.  The picture quality is an improvement over the DVD, but it's not on par with the best Blu-ray titles.  Unfortunately, DNR (digital noise reduction) has been applied, which often gives faces a waxy look.  This is likely the same transfer that was used for the DVD, but in HD this time.  No HD audio is included, but the DD 5.1 English track sounds fine.  Bottom line:  This is only for fans of the movie who can't wait for the U.S. release.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This product WORKS!  Jillian gets right into things starting with level 1 and motivates and pushes you to finish the workout.  Each workout only takes 20 mintues, and she makes you work the whole time!  But the results really do show up once you do the workout routinely.  Jillian is a great motivator and makes the workouts simple and fun to do, which gave me the motivation to do the workout each day.  Even if you think you can start out at level 2 instead of 1, make sure you start with level 1 - Jillian introduces moves that are repeated in the other levels, plus level 1 is tough!  I recommend this DVD for people who are looking for a great way to shed pounds and tone up fast all while having fun.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|As a fan of hard sci-fi, I am at a loss as to why so many current productions have great computer effects but the same banal plots (revolutionary against dystopia with special abilites to inflict violence, etc.).  I read reviews, buy them, and then feel so disappointed that I never want to view them again.  For the most part, while occasionally intrigued, I feel, \\"that's it?  They did this whole thing and THAT was all they had to offer?\\"  Unfortunately, this is one of those films:  the images are striking, the mystery fun, and then you get to the end and wonder how any producer could have imagined it would sell enough to recoup the investment.<br /><br />Not recommended.  I won't play the spoiler, but really, you are better off reading the comic book.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Excellent series, perhaps one of the best semi-documentaries in recent decades.<br /><br />The Bluray extras are great, although not much has changed since the DVD version in terms of content.  The image quality though has gone up several notches, making this a great, gritty war series.
B001DEXDNI|4.0|Lots of times in these reviews people seem to talk more about what ISN'T on the CD than what IS on it. But unfortunately I have to do that too, just for a moment, lol. That's the problem with \\"greatest hits\\" packages - you can't please everyone. Others have already mentioned the omission of Into the West, which is astonishing since it earned her an Oscar for crying outloud. I was also surprised to see that Waiting in Vain was absent as well, since I remember hearing that on the radio quite a lot back in the mid 90's and would surely consider that a hit most people would know.<br /><br />But with that said, the album is otherwise quite good. I really like the new shot of Annie on the cover, and there's a neat little collage in the booklet, as well as lyrics. Of course any Annie fan would have most of these songs already, but it's nice having them all in one spot, remastered, with two new great tracks to boot. Pattern of My Life is an introspective ballad, and the inspirational Shining Light picks up the tempo just a bit to close the disc on a positive note. Songs of Mass Destruction and Bare, her last two albums, brilliant as they were, seemed to have been born out of a dark place, and in this small sampling of new material Annie seems to be looking on the bright side of life.
0767818040|3.0|The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Oh sure Body Double is fun to watch--DePalma is nothing if not entertaining--but it's an unbeleivably contrived picture that doesn't even attempt at plausibility as it moves towards its convoluted climax.
B001CP4VNE|5.0|This Blu-ray Disc is region-free and will play fine in U.S. model players.  The extras from the 2-disc DVD are here, and in NTSC (so those will play, too).  This is also uncut, unlike previous home video versions of the film in the U.K. (a scene where Catwoman puts aerosol cans into a microwave was originally cut in the U.K. but it's present here).  This disc is probably identical to the one that will eventually be released in the U.S. (it even has the FBI warnings).  Picture quality is terrific and a noticeable improvement compared to the DVD.  As someone else noted, this movie looks better on Blu-ray than Batman (1989).  Highly recommended.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  My husband and I enjoyed it together as our Valentine's gift.  We loved it so much, we watched it a second time with the words to the songs and sang along.  We recommend it for all ages and both genders.  It would make a great-fun girls' party movie or a couple's party.  Cyndi and John
1416955070|5.0|Truly an amazing and highly addictive book. I wasn't able to even put it down, and the sequel didn't dissapoint. I can't wait for the third book.

B000209ZAE|4.0|Nice drill stand, does a good job with the proxxon drill. The only flaw is that the fixing handle for the drill gets in the way, I had to use tape to keep it in the up position. Otherwise a good product.
B0000542D2|3.0|The Bottom Line:    If your idea of a enjoyable movie is 100 minutes of hanging out with the Beatles, by all means watch this movie, but if you want a little bit more than a glorified home video whose idea of characterization is assigning each Beatle a single trait, watch something else.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|I haven't been into Bruce Springsteen since Darkness on the Edge of Town. When I saw the Rolling Stone review I sprang for this CD. To say that the record bowled me over is understating the case. There are two weak tracks- Queen of the Supermarket and The Last Carnival. Once they are excised that leaves eleven beauties in a row that you can play all day long. I also decided to give a fair hearing to The Rising and Magic and he's got something going on there as well. The negativity surrounding this CD is mystifying. Add me to the list of people who don't understand it.
B00006AW2M|4.0|Bought this from memory and was a bit dissapointed at first, thinking that the memory does play tricks.  But once I put it on my MP3, with the shuffle turned on, and listened to one track at a time, I was happy with my purchase.
0566076896|3.0|it took a little while to get here and it was a slightly different book than what I had expected, but it was still what I needed
B0012GMV76|5.0|This is a great album. Chet Baker is really good and with his reputation for excessive behavior it is more remarkable. Chet is on his game as is Desmond. Jim Hall is good as expected, but it is the ensemble work with the 2 horn players that makes this exceptional. I like this album much more than Bill Evans' Interplay which is also an ensemble album with Jim Hall. Stereophile magazine has used this album to test speakers and I understand why. It is well recorded and has fine performances. I recommend higly for any fan of Paul Desmond who would like to hear Paul in a group other than the Brubeck quartet. That being said, this is a Jim Hall feature and he is also in great but understated form.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I had only two gripes with the film. One was the quirky pacing of the film, and the somewhat thin performance of Angelina Jolie. But that's about it. I did love the visuals in the film. It's filled with dazzling special effects, lovely music, and gorgeous scenery. The late 30's comic and pulp atmosphere is mixed with modern (50's, 60's and today) sci-fi technologies. I think that's what makes it so appealing: this is an excellent mixture of old and new. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are both great in this film; the supporting cast is also very good. But the best things about this film are the visual effects, the cinematography, and the stylish art direction. Watch it for the visuals.<br /><br />Grade: A-
0316017922|4.0|I found this book to be in the same vein of Gladwell's other work, ie some seemingly unrelated events with minor details, turned into interesting concepts with evidence from unforeseen relationships.     Although, the book is a little misleading in what it's trying to say. The book progresses from individuals or small defined groups who are outliers, such as Bill Gates, to whole populations, such as southerners or asian students. I don't think the book was necessarily focused on the point of outliers, especially when talking about quirks american southerners in comparison to the regional populations (really just in comparison to populations of the East coast and midwest). Gladwell tries to make a case about the increased hostility when southerners defend their honor, but this rise in violence, is it really an outlier? The fact that there are violent crimes in defense of honor from the south doesn't mean that it's an outlier with the north or midwest really, and those populations are left unexamined, with the exception of the citation of a single study done in michigan comparing \\"northerners\\" to \\"southerners\\". I guess my real beef is that the point of trying to make a group (southerns) an outlier to another group (northerners). The point of the book was to identify outliers, not just simply compare two groups. These are more generalizations, not identification of outliers, and they continue to the end of the book. Maybe a better title would've been \\"Tipping Point 2\\". He actually wrote an article identical to the end of the book many years ago, which I read, however I will say that I enjoyed Gladwell sharing the background of his parents, if nothing more than the fact that it was an interesting story and he's an interesting guy.
B001NFNFNA|5.0|CHANGELING<br /><br />***** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- October 31st, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 141-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- J. Michael Straczynski<br /><br />Director- Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Starring- Angelina Jolie, Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly, Colm Feore and John Malkovich as Gustav Briegleb<br /><br />There's no doubt that Clint Eastwood is a Hollywood Icon from his work as an actor and as a producer and director. From the crime/drama genre to the western Eastwood has set the par time and time again. Even in his late 70s Eastwood is showing no signs of slowing down as he's been busy directing movie after movie and Changeling easily rates as one of his very best movies to date; I might give the edge to Million Dollar Baby, but Changeling is another classic in film in the brilliant career of Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />Changeling is a movie that manages to grip you from the start and never let go. This was one of the very best pictures of 2008 and I'm quite surprised it didn't get a best picture nomination or director for that matter. The Academy loves to nominate Eastwood every chance they get and I thought for sure he'd get one here, which in my opinion he was very deserving of as well as the movie.<br /><br />The screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski was terrific; the script is very well written and deep and dramatic and hits all the right spots. This screenplay can serve as a course on how to structure a great screenplay. My only complaint is I would have liked more scenes with mother and son before he goes missing. Obviously there is a bond, but I would have liked to have seen a little more there; but regardless J. Michael Straczynski writes a truly memorable screenplay.<br /><br />As director Clint Eastwood crafts a masterpiece of filmmaking; despite the 141-minute running time Changeling is always moving forward in terms of plot and characters and the pacing never once drags, but I do feel the movie went on a little longer than it needed to, but the scenes never felt tacked or like filler scenes. Clint Eastwood knows cinema more than most and he knows how to make an enjoyable movie and a great movie. I suppose the more movies you make you're bound to miss from time to time, but in general Eastwood has always been on target except for maybe with the Rookie. Here though with Changeling, Eastwood makes one of the best movies of his career and most filmmakers as they get older seem to lose their touch, but Clint is an exception. Eastwood crafts some powerful and dramatic scenes that will stick with the viewer. How he didn't get nominated for this is beyond me.<br /><br />All the performances are excellent; Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins delivers a performance of a lifetime. Her character was sympathetic and brave and the performance was truly inspirational. Jolie was very deserving of her Oscar nomination for Changeling. I like Angelina Jolie, but I'm not a huge fan, but this easily rates as one of my favorite performances. Jeffrey Donovan is also excellent in his role as Capt. J.J. Jones. John Malkovich as Gustav Briegleb is simply amazing; Malkovich is a fine actor and here he delivers one of his finest performances.<br /><br />I highly recommend Changeling; the movie is powerful and dramatic and gripping; everything you could ask for in a movie is here and no doubt it's one of the finest of 2008.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has an amazing transfer and excellent sound. This is one of my favorite BD that I own. The extras on the other hand are a bit weak, but it does feature a Blu-ray exclusive, which is the PIP. Despite the lack of features I'd highly recommend the Blu-ray due to its flawless transfer.Eastwood knows cinema more than most and he knows how to make an enjoyable movie and a great movie.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|Simply put, this is how the Dualshock 3 should have been made in the first place. once they are on, they never need to come off.   Bottom Line, if you have a PS3, buy a set of these for every controller you own.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The DVD is insane.    First you get the incredible Dr. Horrible. Then you get 42 minute Commentary! The Musical as well as commentary by cast and crew.    Evil League of Evil Application videos are fun.    Finally, there are 3 making of videos.    Dr. Doogie Howser would approve.    Join Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, MD; How I Met Your Mother; Harold & Kumar 1 and 2); Nathan Fillion (Firefly; Serenity; BtVS, Castle); Felicia Day (The Guild; June; BtVS; Bring It On Again); Simon Helberg (Big Bang Theory) for an incredible Joss Whedon production.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|After I caught the Pretenders at the House of Blues in Cleveland, I immediately went out to purchase the CDs which I had lost sometime ago to a love interest in college.  These are absolutely the best CD re-releases that I have ever owned ! The CDs cases are not plastic, but small fold out booklets with an additional remove-able booklet for lyrics and liner notes tucked inside.   Plus the demo tracks are AMAZING !!! I actually prefer Chrissie's vocals on some of the demos much better than they actually came through on the final mixes.   I bought all three of the CDs (Pretenders 1, Pretenders 2, and Learning to Crawl) for about $50. All have demos and previously unreleased material. It was the best $50 I had spent on music in quite a long time.   Great band. She is the pride of Akron and Northeast Ohio.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Immensely entertaining documentary about Philippe Petit, a kind of \\"performance terrorist\\", who instead of plotting to destroy the world's most famous buildings and monuments, performs on them via his high wire act.  \\"Man on Wire\\" recounts his most famous stunt: sneaking into the newly-built World Trade Center in 1974, stringing a wire between the two towers, and performing an elegant high-wire act for almost an hour before being hauled off by police.  His eventual punishment? He had to perform his juggling and high wire act for New York's children in free performances in Central Park.  So even the authorities weren't too peeved with Mr. Petit for his memorable crime.<br /><br />Cleverly filmed in the style of a heist movie, \\"Man on Wire\\" moves along at a nice clip, featuring a variety of interviews with Mr. Petit and his compatriots intercut with tense re-enactments of the infiltration of the World Trade Center on that memorable day in 1974.  What's also graceul about the film is that it never mentions the horrible events of September 11, 2001, but by including material about the construction of the towers and what they symbolized at the time, the film also subtly functions as a memorial to their passing.<br /><br />Extra features include a 20-minute featurette about a similar stunt Mr. Petit successfully pulled off in Australia about a year before the World Trade Center event; a 12-minute interview with Mr. Petit that seems to have been conducted after the film wrapped (as he discusses at length his impressions of the movie); and- most impressively- a nine-minute animated film that recounts Mr. Petit's World Trade Center adventure in a wonderful storybook-style aimed at children.  This short cartoon is very well done.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended for documentary fans, \\"Man on Wire\\" will also be immensely entertaining for those who only occasionally delve into the non-fiction filmmaking genre.  One can easily see why it won the Academy Award for Best Feature-Length Documentary Film on February 22, 2009.n February 22, 2009.
B000FS9MV0|4.0|The bottom line is that this girl can sing.  My husband is continually amazed when I tell him how young she is.  I can hardly wait to hear what she does 10-20-30 years in the future.    I really like the mix of boogie-woogie and slow standards on this CD.    Great listening from a major voice.
B0017R5UAA|1.0|I kept hearing comparisons to the Beach Boys, CSNY, etc., but these Fleet Foxes are pretty bland and frankly quite forgettable.  If you like this sort of thing I'd recommend The High Llamas. I'm amazed so many people have given this record such stellar reviews. It's a nice sounding record but nothing to write home about.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Anyone who grew up grooving to Farfisa & Vox organs, Fuzzrite guitars, tambourines, harmonicas, jilted-relationship lyrics of love gone bad, and especially repeated riffs MUST have this collection.<br /><br />A few reviewers dissed this collection because it doesn't compare to the Beatles, Stones, etc.  Well, it isn't MEANT to!  These are our unsung heroes of rock music in its adolescence, not the often overplayed \\"mainstream\\" names (domestic or overseas, and recall how Bono referenced that term). Also, forget what is shoved down our collective throats by infomercials & use-credit-card-for extra-value promotions.  Those are there, but this is HEAR!  Normally, a listener identifies with the about half of the songs which are familiar, then let the others grow on the head, especially easy here.  To appreciate them (& the entire collection) even more, play each disc with the CD-player's randomizer or track-scrambler on, so we don't necessarily know what's coming on next.<br /><br />Many of these songs weren't overplayed on the radio, if at all, so they wouldn't be easy to tire of.  That elevates the level of nostalgia of this set as well as being able to hear them without digging through old 45's.  As well, the 4 discs themselves are nostalgic, their labels emulating the Laurie, Tower, Dunwich, & UNI labels around the Rhino name. There is actually no straight-surfer, hot rod, metal, or lovey-dovey stuff, and it ISN'T what straight Punk is since this came a decade before.<br /><br />Of course, not everything's here (96 Tears, It's a Happening Thing [Peanut Butter Conspiracy], the Remains' version of Diddy Wah Diddy, [though both are represented], Gloria, Omaha [Moby Grape]) and so on.  Other acts represented include the Mojo Men (but not \\"Dance With Me\\"); Cryan Shames (the obscure \\"I Wanna Meet You\\" would've been boss); and Nazz (\\"Hello It's Me\\" would be too mellow for this genre, but the later little-known \\"Not Wrong Long\\" would fit perfectly), as would later titles from the Music Explosion. (Rhino, are you hearing...?)<br /><br />A Nuggets 2 collection features mainly British & overseas acts which I haven't all heard, but there are a lot of other nuggets out there waiting to be collected, including many instrumentals.  I was glad to see the single version of Sagittarius' \\"My World Fell Down\\" with the effects included here, rather than the washed-away LP version. But this set is more than a simple start.  I'd give 5 starz for each disk, which average 76+ to 78+ minutes each; noticed no filler.  Also, despite the mono vs. stereo feuds, I'd say the remastering is Terrific.<br /><br />I was led on to this collection by the recent book \\"1001 Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die\\" (paperback) by Tom Moon which isn't meant to be gulped down in one sitting, but perfect for browsing & reference when you have a Jones for something different.  A good pastime after chores and homework are finished, maybe with \\"Nuggets\\" playing in the background.  Run Run Run to a good Amazon/seller deal, Enjoy Enjoy, then Laugh Laugh.m the Music Explosion.

I'd give 5 starz for each disk, which average 76+ to 78+ minutes each; noticed no filler.  Also, despite the mono vs. stereo feuds, I'd say the remastering is Terrific.<br /><br />I was led on to this collection by the recent book \\"1001 Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die\\" (paperback) by Tom Moon which isn't meant to be gulped down in one sitting, but perfect for browsing & reference when you have a Jones for something different.  A good pastime after chores and homework are finished, maybe with \\"Nuggets\\" playing in the background.  Run Run Run to a good Amazon/seller deal, Enjoy Enjoy, then Laugh Laugh.
1416562605|4.0|Judging from the other reviews, I was prepared for The White Tiger to be an anticapitalist screed, or to at least have a hard-leftist bent. Ha! Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />First of all, the novel is well-written an entertaining. It is dictated in the form of a letter written by the protagonist (\\"The White Tiger\\") to a soon-to-be-visiting Chinese dignitary. The letter recounts the protagonist's ascendancy from the slums (\\"the darkness\\") to success as an entrepreneur. Along the way, he shines a light on the corruption of the Indian political system and the horrible conditions under which the poor of the country live. But does this make the novel anticapitalist? Only if you think what we have in America is anything remotely resembling capitalism.<br /><br />In reality, the novel is anti-\\"democracy,\\" and rightfully so. It shows what a joke democracy is in India, where elections can be bought and sold \\"not like in America\\" -- which I took as being tongue-in-cheek. The political figures mentioned are all hard-leftists: socialists, communists, etc. They claim to be \\"for the poor,\\" but really they are servants of the rich. Just like the political parties in the United States.<br /><br />But what allows the protagonist to rise above it all? His personal ambition and ability to find a niche within the developing capitalist economy of India. He moves to Bangalore and starts his own company, servicing the many outsourcing firms in that city. This way, he becomes rich, and turns the corrupt political system around so that it is in his favor. Of course, there's a lot more to the book than that (including a few murders), but if you think this book is projecting an anticapitalist message, then my guess is you're just seeing what you want to see. I don't think any fan of the free market could possibly get a leftist message from this excellent book.
6305736650|5.0|Although I have often heard about 'Casablanca', I had never seen it.  It is a shame that I had never seen it before.  It is a real gem.<br /><br />Made in 1942, it is set in French unoccupied Morocco.  It features Humphrey Bogart as nightclub owner Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa.  Rick had not seen Ilsa since the day of the Nazi invasion of Paris when they were separated.  She shows up in his club with her husband Victor Lazlo who is an underground leader.  He had been imprisoned by the Germans and Rick had not known she was married.<br /><br />It is an unusual love triangle.  Rick has portrayed himself as apolitical.  He has to decide whether to assist the cause or pursue his love.<br /><br />Although I am not usually one who enjoys romance type movies, this one is very good.  I enjoyed it.  This one is well worth watching.
067101756X|2.0|This book would make for decent science fiction, if it were decently written. To believe that this one officer was tasked with such a monumental assignment...well, it's a stretch.  Technological developments supposedly jumpstarted by alien instrumentation?  Reverse engineering of a technology several thousands of years in advance of the society whose scientists are doing the reverse engineering?  Makes you want to go hmmmmm  Theories for the laser were contemplated thirty years before Roswell, for example. Yet we developed the laser courtesy of ET the EBE? Stretches credibility.  The fact that such a book was allowed to be published makes for a reasonable assumption that it is disinformation, fiction, a cosmic joke, or all of the above.  And the Cold War was a front to enable us to defend against the alien nations out to get us?  How come the SETI radio telescopes after decades of search cannot find an artificially generated electromagenetic signal?  How come all of the published photos of UFOs look like Ed Wood was the photographer?  Yet, the evil empire and the good old US were really preparing for an interplanetary war, all the time we thought it was Capitalism vs. Communism.  Thanks to Corso, we now know better.  Read the book, it's worth a laugh.
0061139378|5.0|This is the third book I have read by Neil Gaiman and once again he didnt let me down.  He is a great story teller who can keep you hooked from beginning to end.  I loved this story because even as an adult it managed to give me goosebumps.  Creepy, weird, fun...all the things I love about Neil Gaiman books.  I really do look forward to seeing the movie.  I have a feeling they did an excellent job.
386521584X|5.0|I heard a bit about this terrific collection of Robert Frank photos on NPR, commemorating the 50th anniversary of its publication in the US. The collection is wonderful, with many shots of a side of 1950s America not usually seen by the public. Robert Frank lugged his camera to black funerals, dirty city streets and urban rooftops to capture the unglamorous -- yet very real -- people who lived there. Some of his images are startling and beautiful. A newsstand's stack of displayed magazines melds into the stacked framework of an office building; a statue of St. Francis, backlit against a murky sky, striding forward to preach repentance to the gas station across the street; an ugly jumble of rooftops is softened by gauzy curtains through which the image was shot.<br /><br />There is plenty of understated social commentary to be seen as well. A city bus dashes by with its load of whites and blacks -- males and whites in the foremost seats, kids in the middle, blacks in the back -- that perfectly mirrors the social pecking order of the day. An overexposed image shows an older black women holding a white baby -- her presence the only splash of color in a world that is otherwise stark and white. And jukeboxes have never seemed so otherworldly than in Frank's images.<br /><br />Nearly all of Frank's seemingly ordinary images carry some sort of a subtle bite or humorous twist. One of my favorite images is of a cowboy lighting a cigarette on a street in New York street -- and in the background is a truck with \\"Dodge\\" (as in Dodge City)  in prominent letters. This sense of twisted fun and irony makes the photos viewable from an artistic level, exciting intellectually, but also fascinating from a social perspective. Frank's point of view is fairly obvious -- he opposes racial bigotry and marginalization of the poor -- but he is never condemnatory toward his subjects or to the story he is telling.<br /><br />\\"The Americans\\" is a terrific collection from a gifted and humane artist. It will make you smile.ile.

0743454537|1.0|I found this book's plot to be manipulative and contrived, the characters were weak and the ending atrocious. There is nothing to be gained by reading this book. Read \\"The Art of Racing\\" instead. You'll thank me.
1400032717|1.0|if there were any case i could give no star,i would give NONE definitely.  i cant believe hw come its a bestseller,seriously!!  the book was used as my school-based reader when i was grade10 and i simply found it reli boring and juvenile.  i read a chapter or two and simply quited.  believe me its for kids under10.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|I didn't even want to read the rest of the reviews after I read this guys review \\"ummmm I guess techno..\\" the problem is that you seem to be musically ignorant, in no way does this sound like \\"techno\\" but if you do want to go there all I have to do is take you back to the origins of hip hop, the second wave, with people like run dmc and fast freddy amongst many others used real electronica sounds, your \\"techno\\" Does planet rock sound familiar? how about africa mambaataa? ... don't be so f****ng stupid, think and do your research when you speak about music, music is life to some of us, and hip hop is the blood.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is one of the rare shows that will keep you glued to your seat.  I could not stop watching the episodes back-to-back.  The storyline/writing is sharp and engrossing.  Micheal C. Hall is amazing as the \\"lovable\\" serial killer.  This show only gets better as it progresses.  Also presents some interesting moral/ethical dilemmas.<br />Love him or hate him, Dexter is a rare and unique character.
B001KMB6X2|3.0|I don't have a problem about the movie, it self; it is a Vin Diesel flick.  True, there could have been more footage; that would give the story more depth.  But the movie was okay.    My problem is with how the bit rate was chump-changed.  The bit rate generally stayed at 4 and below.  I haven't seen a DVD mastered this badly in over 12 years.      Everyone decided that the movie was bad, so they even gave us a crappy video experience.  Corporate America sucks!  So, my question is:  did they screw-up the BluRay version, too?
0375842209|4.0|This book is written from a very interesting perspective. Great character development, and a powerful story. It's one of those books that puts your own life into perspective.

B001PPLIFU|1.0|I still don't understand it.  This is the same production team that had resurrected the Bond franchise, rescuing it from the Moore/Dalton/Brosnan era of self-parody, mediocrity, irrelevance and decay.  Casino Royale was one of the best, if not THE best, Bond films ever, and Daniel Craig was the best thing to happen to the character since Sean Connery.  And then...this, this garbage, this travesty, this lazy insult.  Sorry, but we want Q back again, we want the gadgets (nothing unrealistic, mind you, just the latest techno).  And M is a minor character, we don't need her (or, preferably, him) gumming up the works with feelings.  If the cost of retaining Judi Dench is giving her a major part with all those feelings, then I say give her the old heave-ho.  And where's Moneypenny?  And we need a GREAT villain with a realistic plot (jacking up the price of South American drinking water?  PUH-lease!).  Get a competent semi-unknown to play that minor character, M, and spend the money on GREAT actors to play the principal villains.  Oh, and another thing, the music was crap without a GREAT theme song.  So, here's the list for next time.  1.  Great story line.  2.  Great dialogue.  3.  Dump Dench and cut \\"M\\"'s part.  4.  Bring back \\"Q.\\"  5.  GREAT villain with plausible evil scheme.  6.  Great music with memorable title song.  7.  Oh, and action scenes you can watch without getting a headache from all the gritty and jittery camera-work.  7.  Beautiful girls.  And they don't have to all have \\"attitude\\" without anyone having given them a reason to be cranky and ticked-off at the world.  Finally, regarding Quantum of Solace, I would say to the film's producers and director in the classic words of Roger Ebert, \\"Your movie sucks!\\"
B001GM28HO|5.0|I love that Lady Gaga went ahead and said in her album, \\"This is who I am, I'm not gonna lie.\\"  That got her far in my book, also enjoyed the really tricky dance & pop music, the lyrics were layed down like there was no tomorrow.
0714834491|1.0|i just don't get it.  i bought this based on the reviews and i just don't get it.  i read a lot of graphic design and think i'm reasonably well versed in the field, but his just doesn't do it for me.  See the other one star review about a dozen reviews down -- i agree completely.  the two of us must just be missing something.  maybe try and read an excerpt or something before buying.  its a meaningless, jumbled, uninteresting mess.
B001EOQWF8|3.0|I like the robotic characters, but the grossly fat human characters kinda ruined it for me. Really, would you want to watch morbidly obese characters throughout 1/2 of the movie... whether animation or real people? I'll pass...
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I bought this for my 17 year old son, who first saw it on the web. He made me watch it (I didn't want to), and I found that it was great! The songs are catchy, the voices are really good. The actors who play with NPH are excellent. NPH, as always, is fabulous. The added scenes in this video are what make it a necessary purchase rather than watching it on the web. All these \\"minions\\" sent in their \\"audition tapes\\" to be accepted into the Evil League of Evil. I never laughed so hard in my life! Definitely worth the money!

0307346617|5.0|World War Z takes a realistic look at what would happen in the world if a Zombie outbreak happened.  The story is told in retrospect in a series of interviews.  It really makes you think about global politics and takes a look at how military strategy would have to be changed significantly for a threat like this.  World War Z is an entertaining and uniquely told story that I highly recommend for any fan of Sci-Fi.
B000002UDB|5.0|Take the tour. The Beatles in a time of sound experimentation in the studio.  Lots of fun!  I had heard that Jeff Lynne (of ELO fame) said he had been heavily influenced by the Beatles and i did not understand where that came from.  After listening to Magical Mystery Tour it became clear.  The strings and the horns were used aplenty by the Beatles on MMT.  Lynne later expanded the use of those sounds demonstrating just what pioneers the fab four were.  Listen to \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and hear Lennon sing some lines accompanied only by the background horns.  Really cool when you consider the times and state of rock at that time.
1558908382|5.0|One of my favorite movies of the 90's! John Cusack plays a hitman who returns to his hometown to attend his high school reunion. A great fight takes place between Cusack and former kickboxing champion Benny \\"The Jet\\" Urquidez, who is sent to kill him. Also includes Minnie Driver and Dan Aykroyd in great supporting roles.
B0010DRYSM|5.0|this is hands down my favourite movie OF ALL TIME. i must add, i was not alive when it first came out, so it is not of my generation...but a good movie will be a good movie forever. and this certainly has stood the test of time.     it is absolutely the most well designed, well written, and well played piece of cinema i have ever ever ever seen. though originally adapted from the stage musical, it fleshes out a central story which makes its plot much less disjointed...a good number of songs are cut from the stage version, and a couple new ones added. the new ones surprisingly fit in quite well, as i did not know this until i later saw the stage version and wondered to myself why songs were missing. i've seen the stage version several times- i actually prefer the movie's plot better.     it was nominated for 10 academy awards in 1973 and won 8...the two it lost was to another ageless classic, the godfather. and come on, you can't fault them for losing to that movie...    it doesn't matter if you don't particularly like musicals. if you like meaningful movies that are not obvious but instead heartbreakingly subtle and different, you should see it.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I seem to be in the minority, but this just wasn't as good as I expected.  I much prefer \\"Batman Begins\\".  Over analyzing, I find myself wondering how the Joker managed to set so many charges in the hospital...when did he or his \\"little helpers\\" find the time and opportunity?  Stuff like that just bugged me.  But, most of all (and I suppose one has to be from Minnesota to appreciate this), the Joker reminded me way too much of Al Franken.  Al Franken with lipstick on.  Looked like him.  Sounded like him.  Easy to dislike, sure, but still...disconcerting.
B001NOMNZW|5.0|All 3 movies are EXCELLENT and they are KID Friendly.  My twins, boy/girl 6yrs old, love these movies.

031606792X|1.0|I got caught up in the hype like many others, tore through the first book in a day. Loved it. Second and third were OK, Bella became too self deprecating but after all, a teenager. Edward abandoned her to come back and turn into a controlling boyfriend. Poor Jacob was just a sad puppy dog (sorry, wolf) yearning for her. Not as strong as the first book but seemed liked things were building up to a great finish.  The last in the series had me wondering who the heck wrote it! The baby completely threw me off, I literally had to force myself to finish the book and it was extremely anticlimactic to me. Such a different tone and so many unwelcome tangents. So many unanswered questions, like-does Jacob get his happily ever after even though Nessie will be a teenager for ever when he will most likely age? Will they all move out of Fork?  Some books make me wonder things like this and more, the mark of a solid story. Unfortunately in this book's case, I really did not care.  If you want to see how it all ends, by all means read it--just do what I did and get it from your library.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|My husband saw this in the theater twice and so I bought it for him.  He loved it!  Can't tell what the monster is and the entire movie is with a handheld camera.  Couldn't watch in theater for motion sickness but was fine at home.
0930289234|1.0|This is a horrible comic.  The dialogue is convoluted, tries to sound smart but comes off idiotic instead, the characters are not very likable, and the whole mood is depressing. I like the idea of the book to make superheroes with human frailties but this comes off instead as everybody being self absorbed, depressed, confused, idiotic, living meaningless lives, and full of itself. The book is terrible and I can only hope the movie is better since the depressing story has nowhere to go but up.    The art was also a type that I found uninteresting particularly for the time for there where some awesome comic book artists then.     I am a comic book lover that mainly loves the comics of the late 50's till the very early 70's so maybe this explains why I don't get the attraction to most graphic comics and most particularly this one.
1552095258|5.0|This is an excellent, detailed book on making canoe paddles.  There is a lot of layout and carving information that a first time paddle maker would not have thought of.<br />It would be helpful if the chapters were numbered to match the table of contents, but that's a minor quibble.  If you want to begin making a paddle of your own, buy this book.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I think the title says it all!  Mad Men has great writing, great directing and does an amazing job at establishing a period piece without falling into dumb cliches or hyperbole. The characters are ones who have a timeless quality about them and the issues they face, while not as great today, are still understandable.     Mad Men works on so many different levels because it combines both the traditional drama setting of work out and out work settings and conflicts with realistic and sympathetic people. Mad Men excels at showing the flaws at its protagonists while not making them out to be pure evil.  The Don Draper character is so well formed he seems ready to jump off the screen. Pete Campbell is the evil little weasel every show must have, yet he is also someone with a touch of humanity showing that while Mad Men is to a certain degree soapy it is not a classic soap opera.     I would recommend Mad Men to anyone who wants to watch a compelling drama with real and believable people. This again is great television!
B001CVCB9O|4.0|Let me state upfront that I am a late-comer to the Calexico fanfest. This is the 8th album in the band's rich history since 1997 but it's the first album I've discovered after hearing/reading so much critical acclaim on this that I just had to seek this out, and you can rest assured it won't be the last album I'll be listening to from these guys.<br /><br />\\"Carried To Dust\\" (15 tracks; 45 min.) brings a mesmerizing mix of indie-folk-electric-country-Latin sounds, and even these descriptions don't do full justice to the band. The album consists of a slew of short (in the 3-4 min. range) songs (with 2 short instrumentals) that make their point, and then the band moves on. It all results in a dreamy state of affairs that I just can't put down. There are of course no 'hits' on here, but plenty of highlights: the opener \\"Victor Jara's Hands\\" sets the table; \\"Man Made Lake\\" ends in a searing electric guitar solo; \\"Inspiracion\\" is a Spanish-song little ditty with great Mexican horns; \\"House of Valparaiso\\" features Iron & Wine's Sam Beam on vocals; and so on. There are really no weak tracks on here, period.<br /><br />In all this is a great album that deserves all the critical acclaim it has gotten. I can only hope to see these guys live at some point, what a show that I suspect it would be. Hopefully they'll be either at Coachella or Bonnaroo, both of which I'll be attending this year. Meanwhile, \\"Carried To Dust\\" is highly recommended!

Not just because guys used pyrotechnics, but THEY ARE REAL MUSICIANS...and Sharon is REAL ARTIST, real Performer. Using 60 pieces Symphonic orchestra this is music.    Unfortunately, This is not for Mainstream USA, which completely full with tasteless 1 minute fortune crap. If you're Fan of WT this buy is essentials. Even if you aren't you'll have some picture what real musical MUSICASHIP and performance are.

1401923119|3.0|The bit about changing your own subconscious negative behaviors into good ones is a sham.  This book does NOT tell you how to do it.  It hints that it will, but at the end the advice is to attend a PSYCH-K seminar...which costs about [...] bucks.<br /><br />So the secret of life is: Send me five hundred dollars and I'll tell you.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|The description on Amazon didn't tell me this was a \\"full screen\\" pan and scan DVD.  I was hoping for the film exactly the way it was shown in the theater, not something that some camera man re-directed so that it would fit on somebody's old-style TV.  Caveat Emptor definitely applies here.  Now that I have the film, I'll start looking for the wide-screen version.
0393061310|5.0|So many positive reviews have been written about this book that another review risks not saying anything material.<br /><br />However, this work is of such good quality and its findings are so profound that it merits yet another review.<br /><br />The basis of the book seeks to answer the question posed to Diamond by a friend from New Guinea, \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\"<br /><br />Jared as a trained Geographer sets off to answer the question and the answer that he comes up with makes logical and intuitive sense to most everyone but which nobody had to date been able to articulate thoughtfully in a good book: biodiversity.  As he explores the world, he discovers that after the last ice age the European continent had the right mix of flora, fauna, climate, ample food, four distinct seasons, natural resources like steel, germs, and size that when the extremely innovative and intelligent learning animal (humanity) showed up (well we were already there) but humanity was able and forced by climate/geography/population to make use of all of the resources available to him/her there.  This allowed Europeans to break out from Europe and bring Cargo to the people of the Pacific Islands: people who did not have resources, pressure, beasts of burden, or geography to develop the civilization that Europeans were able to develop.<br /><br />The work is simply phenomenal.  The book is wonderful in many respects because it brings all humans together as members of one big race that at some point in time rose to and adapted to colonize the entire planet and that this diversity and differences in all of us is valuable and that it should be cherished.  After all, it was a man from New Guinea who stood up and asked this extremely profound question of Diamond.  Clearly the man had time to contemplate this topic and it took someone like Diamond to chase down the answer.<br /><br />Impressive book all the way around.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|I have respected and loved Animal Collective's musical philosophy and experimentation. The members themselves have declared, in essence, that their music is exploration of new and different sonic territories, and that some of it works and some of it doesn't.    Having accepted that philosophy in my listening, I grew to enjoy many of A.C.'s albums, especially \\"Feels\\". However, my love for the enveloping tidal wave of their sound was renewed and multiplied when I listening to \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\". As I let the songs wash over me in my car, it was obvious that their vision - the goal and ambition to carve out a musical niche both accessible and representative of their symphonic and sometimes cacaphonous imagination - was fully realized in this album. I prefer listening to albums as a whole, but soon developed favorite tracks (2, 4, 9 and 11) that I would repeat over and over again.    Listen to this album in its entirety, and then listen to it again. It will make much more sense the second time.
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is one of those movies that opens people's eyes to the truth behind diamonds.<br /><br />Diamonds used to be valuable because they were so hard and because they were so hard to find.  With the discovery of many new diamond mines in Africa and elsewhere there are so many cut diamonds that they're only about as valuable as other semi-precious stones but because of a few entities like DeBeers who control diamond trade and actually hoard diamonds in vaults, they keep the prices high.  In hoarding diamonds though they not only keep the prices high, they also precipitate diamond wars - hence the term blood diamond where the currency that we exchange for diamonds is not just money but human life.<br /><br />This movie hits you pretty hard and after it if you think about the world you live in it helps to shatters the world that you might have grown up with and you begin to wonder about those who control diamonds, oil, technology, sugar, coffee, alcohol, and you begin to wonder at how society is controlled today.<br /><br />Blood Diamond is one of those movies and if you don't want to think about that, its a great action drama with great actors.  If you care though, the story told underneath is of a staggering scope.<br /><br />Buy it, watch it, and play it for your daughter when she starts getting dazzled by shiny rocks and show her the truth.

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|All I can say to those who haven't seen this movie is: Don't bother. I don't think I'd say its awful, it's just trivial and inconsequential. I am a fan of Bardem, Cruz and Johansen, but their performances didn't redeem this. The voiceover was annoying and the cinematography looked like a home movie, and totally failed to capture the beauty of Barcelona. Except for the occasional shot of Parc Guell or Sagrada Familia, it might have just as easily been Los Angeles. And if you think its gonna be erotic, think again.

This album wouldn't sell more then a few thousand units, if that many, without the Queen name slapped on the cover!                              All you 4 and 5 star reviewers (except of course J. Combs, the corporate shill whose job it is to drum up interest in this product) ask yourselves this, would I have even heard about this album unless the Queen name was on it, if you're honest with yourselves you would have to say no!

B00003CWPL|4.0|I purchase this movie for my daughter at Christmas as we sat watching we just kept asking ourselves, where is this going? In reality David Lynch takes us on this wild look into a very strange person's life. The dinner scene at the girlfriend's house epitomizes all of the bad dinners you have ever had at someones house. It is bizarre, brilliant and surreal. For that matter the whole movie is surreal. Shot as a low budget film, it makes you uncomfortable, you want to help these people, you want to yell at them to stop, you want to tell them to get a life! Lynch really sets in motion a whole series of events that keep you shaking your head until the very end. This is a movie worth owning.
B001THZAAI|5.0|This film has become the most-seen (among the French themselves) film in the history of French film. In fact, has been seen by more French than any other film - period. It's funny, warm, and inclusive, and holds a mirror up to French viewers to allow them to laugh at their own clichés about regional differences. The fun ranges from slapstick to very sophisticated verbal punning, based on the more-or-less incomprehensible (even to most native French speakers) regional dialect of the North of France. The puns and misunderstandings are legion, and have Francophone audiences howling with laughter in the theaters. What about non-French-speaking viewers? Well, in fact, the English-language subtitles are superb, and succeed in capturing the flavor of the humor, at times choosing an analogous joke which works well in English, rather than a direct word-for-word translation which would fall flat. (Dany Boon, the film's writer and director - and one of its lead actors - is reported to have stayed involved with the production of the subtitles, indicating his desire to have the film's communication with Anglophone viewers be as rich as possible.)     To be brief, the humor succeeds both in revealing regional cultural differences very particular to the French, and also in playing with the basic idea of strangeness in a culturally neutral fashion. Evidence to that last assertion is the fact that the rights to re-make the film in the USA - and, presumably, to reset the action in an American frame - have been bought by Will Smith's production company.    There are several other emotionally deeper subplots which make the film richer than just an exercise of the smiling muscles. The relation between the two male leads moves from initial bias, awkwardness, and distrust to a genuine emotional (not sexual) intimacy, which allows both men to find the tools to resolve fundamental relationship issues with their respective female partners. Those three stories are somewhat predictable in their trajectories, which doesn't mean at all that they lack emotional power. Classical plot devices have become classics because they work; these plots have a germ of truth within them that allows us to remain interested in the particulars of how these individual people are going to fix their broken communications, to allow the resolution of the difficulties which are the motors of these plots.    Although it's been nonsensically claimed that \\"20 million Frenchmen can't be wrong,\\" in this case, they're not, and the film invites you to participate whether you're a French-speaker or not. (Yes, I know: \\"50,\\" not \\"20.\\" But 20 million is the box in France as of this writing.) Very highly recommended.
B0017YZIL4|5.0|This is my favorite Jazz Guitar album and one that I've had for some time, first on a cassette that I got from my brother and eventually on CD.  I used to listen to this in my car and didn't even know the names of the songs or who had written them.  All I knew was that I really dug Montgomery's guitar playing.<br /><br />After getting the 1987 version of the CD, I learned that the album included Sonny Rollins' \\"Airegin\\", Dave Brubeck's \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\", 2 standards, and 4 originals by Montgomery.  I also learned that his supporting cast included Tommy Flanagan on piano and the Heath brothers on bass and drums.<br /><br />This album is a real pleasure to listen to, not just for Montgomery's truly incredible guitar playing, but also for the relaxing atmosphere all 4 musicians create.  This is a perfect album to play late at night before going to bed; just turn down the lights, lie down on your couch, and let the music soothe your soul.<br /><br />My only complaint about the CD I owned (the 1987 remastering) was that the sound was kind of muddy.  While reviewing that version, I learned that this \\"Keepnews Collection\\" version had been released, so I ordered it to compare the sound.  It does have slightly better sound, mainly stronger bass.  In retrospect, I suspect that the \\"muddiness\\" I heard in the 1987 version was mostly in Montgomery's own sound or in the source tapes.<br /><br />The real value of the 2008 version, however, is the new booklet with a new essay by Orin Keepnews, who produced the original sessions.  He explains how he first heard about Montgomery from Cannonball Adderly, talks about the first two records (including this one) that Montgomery cut for Riverside, and explains the boastful title.  He also puts the album in the broader context of Montgomery's brief but brilliant 9 year career.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I wanted to like this film. I like Danny Boyle. I am of Indian extraction. But Slumdog really isn't about Indian, the slums, or even human beings. It's about the transformative of power cinematic illusions. As such it succeeds on its own terms, but so what?<br /><br />**spoiler alert**<br /><br />To see how manipulative this film is consider the following question: how would the film have been different if Jamal's mother did not die? Answer: the only consequence is that he would not have known the answer to a game show question.<br /><br />I'm not joking. That is the *only* discernable difference. Jamal's mother is beaten to death in a pogrom and this influences Jamal's psyche not at all. Later in the film, Jamal's girlfriend (Latika) is raped by Jamal's brother. Again, Latika seems to suffer no ill effects from this sexual assault.<br /><br />How are the children of the slums able to overcome such trauma? What is their source of inner strength? We never find out because Slumdog makes it clear that the events it depicts are mere plot devices and do not represent real events. The mother really didn't die; the girl really wasn't raped. It's all fake. It's just a fantasy about a boy getting the girl of his dreams. There will be Bollywood ending (complete with a little dance) just in case you had any doubts about the complete unreality of what you just saw. Memories of children being orphaned, mutilated, sexually assaulted, and sold into slavery are all erased in the blinding light of Latika's model-perfect but entirely vacant smile. Hey, that's cool. After all, it's just a movie.<br /><br />This sort of nonsense comes off rather badly when compared to the brilliant film Salaam Bombay! The street kids in Salaam Bombay! face the same tragedies the kids in Slumdog face. But Salaam Bombay! shows that these stark circumstances are bearable because the children of the slums have individual worth. The urchins have internal lives and real motivations (compare this to Latika or the one-eyed urchin who are just there to move the plot forward). The children of Salaam Bombay! survive their suffering because they create dignity within that suffering. At no time does Salaam Bombay suggest that the main character's suffering is illusory or that it can be forgotten if he just finds a suitably beautiful girlfriend.<br /><br />I don't deny that Slumdog is reasonably well acted and entertaining. Yet that is part of the problem. In view of films like City of God and Salaam Bombay!, I think we can and should be demanding more than just entertainment.to move the plot forward).

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|There must be different versions of this film because I certainly didn't see anywhere near a 5 star film.     The acting, with the fabulous exception of Penelope Cruz, is bland and annoying.  When Cruz enters the film, she shines.  However, since the other actors have done brilliant performances in other films, I'd have to say it was the direction and script.    The film I saw was inane, filled with self-absorbed characters and a less than witty dialogue.

1416562605|4.0|2008 appears to the be the year to celebrate the story of unconventional transformation, from rags to riches, of India's underdogs - the folks at the very dregs of India's social, cultural, economic and caste strata. \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" has been nominated for a large number of Oscars (with the Oscar ceremony just a few hours away) and Mr. Adiga's book - white tiger - having won the 2008 Man Booker Prize. Both of these share the common theme of putting on center stage the abject filth, absolute corruption and horror of what life at the bottom of India's society can be. All of this interwoven into an entertaining tale of the transformation of an underprivileged protagonist who share the common strains of sheer determination and willingness to take a big risk.     In Mr. Adiga's case, it is the tale of transformation of an ordinary chauffeur into a budding entrepreneur in the heart of India's technological center, Bangalore. This is not a story you are likely to read in the pages of Economist or Business week, but every bit as realistic and far more interesting than any your may find there. The story unfolds in a series of letters which the protagonist, Mr. Balram, writes to the Premier of China who is on a visit to India to learn about entrepreneurship. And there is a lot for Mr. Jiabao, and all of us to learn. While Mr. Adiga claims his novel to be a work of fiction, but it is fiction far closer to reality than I seen in recent past in an English novel. The farce that Indian schooling system for the underprivileged is with it drunken teachers and stealing of school uniforms for the poor, the electoral system where only the corrupt stand and looting of ballot boxes and intimidation of anyone wanting to vote is rampant, the unfettered brutality of the police and feudal lords of the anyone without a voice, the horrors of India's dowry system and the abject filth in which the servants live sometime right within the posh housing complex of the upper class are all interwoven into this satirical and entertaining tale. Mr. Adiga's depiction in the character of Ashok, Balram's master, whom Balram kills to make his transformation, of the hollow idealism and impotency of the foreign return middle-class Indian ever ready to make any compromise in the face of corruption to sustain their position of privilege,  is also very poignant.  This novel lacks the intellectual depth in the depiction of emotions and character as in Umrigar's \\"The Space Between Us\\" or the literary finesse of Ms Arundhati Roy in The God of Small Things, two other novels that cover the same clientele, but is more sardonic, comprehensive and witty in its depiction of the absurdity and horrors of life at the bottom of society.  Mr. Adiga uses the simile of an overcrowded rooster's coop of the variety that any Indian who has gone to buy chicken in the market of Old Delhi can relate to, to depict how difficult the escape from such a coop is made not only by the net but the other chickens inside who are more likely to hold you back. An escape from this coop is as rare a the sighting of a white tiger, the title of this notable first novel by Aravind Adiga.

0143038419|2.0|Every self discovery process tends to be a very personal & individualized experience.

While not every reader would necessarily identify wsith the situation, good writing would help the reader identify with the feelings. humor, or any other element the writer wanted to share while sharing the experience.<br /><br />For me, Elizabth Gilbert hadn't translated her experiences to a well written book that I can identify with.

B001TH16DI|3.0|The video and audio of these Blu-ray discs mark a clear improvement over previous DVD releases, but they are problematic and could be better.     First, it should be noted that the theatrical versions of all the films are presented in this Blu-ray release. This means that the previously released Director's Cut version of Trek I with the new special effects is absent, as are the versions of Trek II and VI that contained extra footage. This guarantees that there is going to be another Blu-ray of these films in a few years.     Video:    The video boasts the types of improvements you'd expect from Blu-ray vs DVD: vivid image, few signs of MPEG compression on large screen TVs, etc. As other people have noted, Paramount went overboard on the digital noise reduction. FACT: Film has grain. This is one of the characteristics of film that gives it its unique look and texture. Putting aside the debate of grain vs. no grain vs. some grain, the problem with digital noise reduction, is that by removing film grain, you also strip a layer detail off of the video (the problem is akin to tape hiss reduction with analog audio recordings). The reduced image fidelity from DNR is most notably on actors faces. As a result, the video quality could be a lot better.      Trek II underwent a comprehensive restoration by Lowry Digital. The video is crystal clear -- you can see where the makeup begins and ends on Nimoy's face -- and like the best Blu-rays, the video retains the look of film. Excessive grain that resulted from use of an optical printer for special effects shots (such as Kirk talking to Kahn via the Enterprise view screen) has been reduced without also reducing image fidelity. Please note that the overall look of video is still soft with muted colors, but that's because Trek II was essentially a low budget film. The film stock they used and cinematography were at best serviceable. So don't expect the video to look like film was photographed by Vittorio Storaro. But Lowry has done a fantastic job and it is hard to imagine Trek II looking any better.      Audio:    In all the movies the audio has more presence than previous DVD releases, with the stereo imaging spread out wider. Most notable is that ambient sounds are more audible. As expected, the more recent the film, the better the sound is. The sound on Trek VI is really quite excellent.      Extras:      With the exception of Trek I, all the special features from the previous 2 disc DVD versions has been carried over. Not all of the features from Trek I were brought over because some were specific to the Director's Cut version that is not featured on the Blu-ray.    All the movies feature a new commentary track and a few new featurettes. Frankly, everything that can be said about these films has been said over the last two and three decades. The new extra features are at best filler. With the exception of Trek II, the commentaries are not by the filmmakers, but people who have been involved with other Trek movies or TV shows. This was an interesting idea, but really didn't work out well. Understandably, no one wants to say anything critical of another person's film, and folks rather talk about their own Trek projects. That being said, Ron Moore's commentary on Trek III is pretty entertaining, and he's not afraid to be critical of the film (though I think he goes out of his way to say nice things about it at the same time). The only refreshing thing about the commentaries is that multiple commentators broke the silence on how much they disliked Trek I.     By far the most substantial new special feature is the \\"Captain's Summit\\" which features a roundtable interview with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart and Frakes, moderated by Whooppi Goldberg. It's certainly entertaining, but again, doesn't offer new insights. If you're buying this set, you've probably seen many of the interviews these actors have done for other DVD releases, on TV, etc. For instance, we yet again hear that the TNG actors hatedtheir space suits. Kinda problematic is that Shatner and Nimoy dominate the interview, and whenever Stewart and Frakes are trying to make a point, Shatner interrupts them with lame questions. At one point Nimoy nicely tells Shatner to shut up and let Frakes and Stewart talk. I got the idea that Frakes is really the most interesting of the group and I wouldn't mind hearing a one-on-one interview with him. The one noteworthy thing, is that when asked what they were most thankful to Star Trek for, Shatner and Nimoy said financial stability, and Stewart and Frakes said friendship.     Bottom line:    Given that these films are eventually going to be re-released on Blu-ray to contain the extra footage that has been included on previous DVD versions, and that hopefully at that time the video problems will be fixed, I say you're better off renting these titles instead of buying them.

0307387178|4.0|McCandless' death in the Alaska wilderness in the early 1990s was a big news story because it provided a great Rorschach test for journalists and readers.  Is McCandless a stupid reckless youth who threw his life away?  A typical contintental American who was attracted to Alaska and did not sufficiently appreciate and respect the rigors of its wilderness?  Is he a latter day Thoreau?  Is he just mentally ill?  Is he part of the great American tradition of going on the road to discover himself -- going West to reinvent himself?  Everyone reads into McCandless' saga his or her own political schtick.      Krakauer, to his credit, seeks to understand McCandless by empathizing with him.  He makes an attempt to put aside all the symbols and politics and just understand McCandless as a fellow human being.  It is a difficult task given the lack of data, and given that Krakauer never met him, and inevitably Krakauer reads into McCandless some of his own life experiences.  But in the end, empathy is the noblest of emotions, and Krakauer is able to write a moving and absorbing narrative.    There is much that in universal and appealing in McCandless:  His alienation from his family, and his overreaction to discovering the hypocrisies and imperfections of his father; his distaste for the crass materialism and consumerism of American culture; his desire to test himself against the world and nature; his yearning for adventure.  Krakauer's tale of his own misadventures at McCandless' age is quite moving and adds to the power of the story.      In the end, the ultimate issue presented by McCandless is to what extent is he simply mentally ill?  I tend to agree with Krakauer that McCandless, while certainly in a bad mental condition, was on a journey of discovery that would have led him back to a healthy and productive life had he not suffered a few bad and ultimately fatal breaks in the Alaska wilderness.      Krakauer's book is excellent, and his ability to empathize is admirable.
0307269752|1.0|This book fails as a crime thriller/mystery on so many levels.<br /><br />1.  Structurally vapid at its core.  The trope of a great mystery-thriller is that the good must represent a worthy match for the evil --  here, the wonderfully drawn (sic) character of Lisbeth  (the \\"good\\") is completely disappointed by the inconsistently and poorly rendered character of the antagonist.  I won't spoil the plot by giving names.  The best part of this book is the middle part (as others have said), where Lisbeth is truly fully developed and is revealed and proven through a series of very direct encounters with her guardian.  Indeed, the representation of exploitative, physical evil represented by Lisbeth's guardian meets the standard of a good thriller, and it provides a solid match for Lisbeth's creative and intellectual strengths.  Unfortunately,  the plot quickly turns elsewhere and forces Lisbeth to play on a field with an evil antagonist who is very badly written, self-contradictory, uninteresting, tiresome, unbelievable as a villain and, in sum, unworthy  of Lisbeth as an adversary.<br /><br />2.  A Badly Plotted Heroine.  As noted, Lisbeth is fully drawn and a memorable character.  Her function in the book is to move the plot forward through research and hacking.  Sadly, there is nothing in her character that connects to her skills in research and hacking.  Instead of some ringed-up, tatooed wild girl , we could as easily have had a nice college girl in the engineering department sporting a ponytail and good manners.  There is nothing convincing about why Lisbeth has to be the way she is in order to have the skills she has.  Yes, the skills are critical to the outcome of the book.<br /><br />3.  A Mash up of Three Books.  The book consists of three completely separate plots:  (1) the search for revenge against a arms-dealing industrialist, (2) the search for a missing grandniece and (3) a search for a serial killer.  Although strewn with family names and characters that are hard to keep straight (and will make your head hurt, as they are all only side stories with no bearing on the plot) the search for the missing grandniece actually proceeds fairly conventionally, with interviews and documentary evidence and search in archives, etc. etc.  This search is mildly entertaining.  The search for the serial killer shows up late in the book as there arises a discovery that missing persons and family members seem to be linked.  Here is where the book starts to blow up, as the author (clearly remembering the trope that great good much be matched by great evil -- See \\"vapid at its core\\" above) suddenly creates a grotesque backstory for his new villain that is fully displayed and explained in less than two pages and has no foreshadowing or logic altogether.  Indeed, the weight of evidence leading to this villain is only just tenuously put together when -- completely out of character -- the villain shows up of his own accord and starts trying to kill our hero.  Nonetheless, This improbable villain is now tied to the missing niece and so now we find out something about why and how the niece has gone missing.  Thank you for that.  Finally, the story about the evil industrialist held some promise -- especially for a financial writer like Larsson, one expect some unique insights into international money skullduggery -- but all devolves into the usual plundered Swiss Bank Account story, with no great detail at all as to the underlying felonies of the corporate creep.<br /><br />In sum, this is a confused book, badly edited for consistency, whose ultimate antagonist is unworthy of the great female character Larsson has created (even though her abilities have little to do with the character and more with the needs of the plot).straight (and will make your head hurt, as they are all only side stories with no bearing on the plot) the search for the missing grandniece actually proceeds fairly conventionally, with interviews and documentary evidence and search in archives, etc. etc.  This search is mildly entertaining.

0671015206|3.0|This book offers sound advice much of which is common sense. My biggest complaint with the book is that it looks at most situations from an employee perspective. Obviously over 30 or 40 years if you live below your means you will have socked away enough money that the compounded interest will have greatly increased your wealth. Time and time again the book references Millionaires who are in their fifties. Being in my twenties I think there must be a better way to become a millionaire than just go into work for the rest of my life, cut back on expenses, and clip coupons.<br /><br />This book is rich with numbers and stats, but falls short in giving you advice in how to actually increase your revenue or cash flow. Granted most investing advice looks at what to do with your money after you have made it instead of teaching you how to actually generate more income/revenue. This book is no different.<br /><br />It was interesting to learn many Millionaires were small business owners with somewhat boring business. Also scarier to see these small business owners who are \\"rich\\" spoil their kids and turn them into employees by sending them to expensive colleges. Thus after 3 generations the ability to generate true wealth is lost. Having a job with a single source of income does sound a lot riskier than running a business with 100s of customers. If you lose your job you are out all your income, if you lose a single customer you still have 99 more to pay the bills.<br /><br />Solid advice most of which I learned from my parents growing up.

One would have expected a ten disc set to be huge and bulky(The VHS tapes took up a lot of room after all!)but to the contrary-they've managed to fit the entire series-both seasons one & two along with an addition disc of extras into a very compact little box set! For all you get it's really amazing if you think about it and for all the hours of entertainment you get it doesn't take up all that much room on your shelf. Any fan of the show should get this! The picture and the sound has been remastered with the option to stick to the original sound (2.0) or the remastered surround sound (5.1). Get NOW before the price goes up or they run out of stock!

0307454894|2.0|I picked this up in the airport not knowing that it was the basis for an Oscar-nominated best picture movie.  I'm usually not that oblivious.  Right after I purchased it, my husband said \\"ew, that's a creepy book.\\"  I wondered what I was getting into.    Bottom line, I finished the book during my two flights.  It was an easy, fast read.  There was time between the flights, during dinner, and at the end of the night to discuss the book with my family.  Early on my son asked me who is the antagonist, and is it man vs man, or man vs society, or something else.  My answers to his questions evolved as I read the book, but that's all that evolved.    The book is three parts -- the affair, the trial, later in life.  There was little if anything that changed about \\"the kid\\" from the first page of part 2 to the end of the book.  Perhaps that lack of change is a reflection of the damage done to his psyche due to the affair.  That's a lot of pages to read to show his lack of development.  Hanna is just as undeveloped and essentially unchanging over time.  Yes, she eventually learns to read and write, but no interesting communications or insights are forth-coming from this skill.  Overall, a very unfulfilling read.  I was happy to be done with the book, so I could share the end with my family, and let them know the characters never really changed nor came to any great revelations.      The only redeeming aspects of the read that led to a bit of interesting family discussion were the two questions broached.  1.) What standards do you apply to war criminals, the current law, law at the time, law as it was enforced at the time, etc.  2.)  What is your moral duty to help someone when they'd rather succumb to harm than accept help.    Bottom line -- not worth my time.  Yet again I've stumbled across something that I found out later was an Oprah Pick, and yet again I was disappointed.
0761129235|5.0|This book has simplified my life - I am not as overwhelmed as I was before.  There are so many good pieces of advice in it and examples as well.  Everyone should read it !!!  Thank you.  Linda H.
B001AQT0SG|5.0|I have the old VHS version of this film. Only a handful of movies will give you such lush stuning scenes and customes.  The storyline is of course pure science fiction but compeling none-the-less.  I hope that when it comes out on Blu ray it will be at least edited to its original state.  A very interesting plot of galactic proportions; love, betrayal, war, mystery, suspence....  you get the picture.  This movie was made for blue ray, sorround sound... can't wait for it to get here!!!
0312383320|1.0|This book had so much over-the-top silly comedy that I couldn't even finish it.  If you like that type of humor, you might enjoy it, but if you are hoping for the character of the earlier by-the-numbers Plum books, this book may not work for you.    I expect a light \\"beach read\\" when I buy a Stephanie Plum book (I've bought & read them all), and I'm willing to pay hard cover prices for the by-the-numbers books even though they're quick reads, but releasing these between-the-numbers books as hard covers is asking way too much of us readers... Maybe if the books were paperback and had a whole different look to them, so it was clear they were supposed to have a different style and quality as the by-the-numbers books, it wouldn't be so painful...
0140135154|1.0|Philosopher Mario Bunge once told the story of a muslim physicist who stated, nonchalantly, that \\"Quantum Mechanics can be inferred from The Holy Koran -conveniently interpreted.\\" Such is the way of interpretation: once you know where you want to get at, you can start anywhere.  So does Mr Berger. Obedient to the article of faith that everything in the Western World during the last centuries has one way or the other to do with Capitalism, he set out to prove that Oil Painting and like manifestations are unconscious epiphenomena of class struggle and property relations.  With this preconception in mind he doesn't bother to investigate the true motivation of painters and patrons. It would anyway be futile because he shares Freud's irrefutability that \\"Every man suffers from Oedipus complex. If it doesn't show it is surely being repressed.\\" So for him this couple standing in their garden must necessarily be showing off their property. How could it be otherwise? The same can be said about this cow: we are informed that it's not the representation of an animal but of a \\"piece of furniture with four legs\\". He quotes, and dismisses by an argument of \\"unconscious resistance\\", the position of another critic that only sees the couple's \\"enjoyment of nature.\\" Of course both are unsubstantiated interpretations. What is untenable is playing down the rival as someone possessed by unconscious class prejudices.  The author condemns the European exploitation of the rest of the world yet his vision remains profoundly eurocentric. He doesn't stop for a moment to think that cows, or people or myths or whatever the subject of the capitalistic paintings he interprets, have been pictured elsewhere for a long time. Is it that Capitalism already existed 4000 years ago to inspire the representation of Egyptian furniture-cows? Marx himself would be astonished.  But the author's methods are not just questionable, they are also partly dishonest. The last chapter pretends to be a proof that Advertising as a whole is a contemporary manifestation of that same Capitalistic Unconscious. Right now I'm watching a TV commercial trying to convince me that this gel cleaner is a better product for my kitchen and bathroom than the old abrasive type. How can the author fit this into his theory of Advertising as something that \\"makes me envious of myself in the future?\\" The trick lies in sampling very specific products, such as those related to beauty or fashion. Trying to sell a cream might be a morally questionable activity, but how else if not by promising beauty or the advantages of it? So it is not about \\"Advertising\\" in general. The selection bias is well smuggled and in any case, his chain of reasoning runs backwards.  Well, maybe I'm also resisting, or acting as an unconscious agent of the Bourgeoisie. But I'm not alone: I've been told that Walt Disney did worse with Donald Duck.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I loved all of the U2 albums from the 90's, those 3 are my favorites and this one is one of their best.  \\"Please\\" and \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" are so raw and powerful, I love the lyrics.  Its funny that his album was titled Pop because the songs are not mainstream or pop at all.  I would say Achtung or Joshua Tree are much more Pop than this one.  This album is about pushing the envelope musically and I think they nearly hit a homerun.  Give this one a listen and enjoy.
0307269752|5.0|I loved this book and Steig Larsson is a talent that will be missed. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel that is due to be released in the summer of 2009.

0689865384|1.0|I love reading Young Adult Fiction and after seeing this book as a recommendation from other books I've enjoyed, I jumped right in. The plot and characters seemed intriguing, but the book started off very slow. I thought it would pick up but it never did. I just couldn't finish it, I felt like this was too Young adult for me. I couldn't get past the easy read, words like \\"Uglies,Pretties & Littlies\\" and I felt no no real suspense or development. Overall I think I just felt too old to read it or enjoy it. This is a very young read.
1423113497|5.0|This is very nicely done! Love the books and mythology! Can't wait for The Last Olympian.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Watching an epic like QUO VADIS really makes you marvel at the sheer scale of such films -- and why, in that form -- they will never been seen again.  GLADITOR, with it's CGI, would probably have cost five or six times as much had it been done with real sets and thousands of extras.  The actual making of this movie is, in itself,  an incredible epic of a film long delayed but when finally realized, a crowning achievement.  Robert Taylor probably gives one of his best performances here along with Deborah Kerr (whom I've always loved since her films with Stewart Granger) and a really over the top performance by Peter Ustinov.  A great edition and addition to any home video library!
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down and I was on a trip and all I did was read! I was very shocked at the plot of this book, but she made it work and made me wanting more.     This book also makes me think of our worlds future and wondering if something like this really could happen? Makes you take a look at the people around you and wonder what you would do to survive.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This collectors set is indispensable.  What the product description doesn't mention enough of is the DOCUMENTARY - \\"Dangerous Days\\" which is as detailed a documentary as ever made on any film.  At 3.5 hours, it's reason alone to buy this set.  It is a must watch besides the extras.  It took a long time but it was worth the wait.  PS get the book FUTURE NOIR by Paul Sammon for a complete experience.<br /><br />Ridley and team, we salute you!
0439806119|3.0|I started to read this book because I got the series for my sister who barely reads and she seemed to like them. I did like this book generally I thought the writing could of been better and the descriptions of things could of been thought out and more descriptive. I have read the synposis for the other books and I don't like the direction of where these books are heading. I think it totally goes agaisnt the whole premise of the book and what you are suppose to take from it. I also would like the author to not think I am a total idiot and I don't need everything spelled out for me. I understand the premise of the book and what he is trying to convey to people, but I feel as though he is shoving it down my throat and not letting me figure it out on my own.    This book is for young adults you can tell by the way he writes, so I do recommend it just realize it is a very bland way of story telling to me.
B001JNNDAQ|5.0|Known for having one of the best car scenes in a film.  Known for it's gritty storyline and showcasing a different side of the police.  \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\", the winner of five Academy Awards back in 1971 will be released on Blu-ray disc.  And all I can say is that if you are a big fan of this film, \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" on Blu-ray disc is the definitive version to own.<br /><br />The film will always be known for its grittiness, a different take of a New York police detective, a car chase scene, the music and its grittiness.  But what the Blu-ray disc also provides is the making and behind-the-scenes of \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" which probably can be a movie in itself because of all that went on behind-the-scenes which was very surprising.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />The picture quality is quite interesting for \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\".  This is one of the few films similar to a Criterion release in which the film is presented the way the director intended.  20th Century Fox did the same with this film.<br /><br />Director William Friedkin was very much involved in the way the film looked (in fact, there is a special feature on the color timing of the film).<br /><br />With that being said, the film is the best looking version of the \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\".  Having owned the first DVD release, the colors are much different.  Friedkin wanted to show the grittiness of the city and thus you get some blues and deep blacks in the color.<br /><br />But I noticed there was a lot of grain in certain scenes and some scenes looked like a 1971, old film.  Where some viewers may have wanted a cleaned up film, because Friedkin was very much involved in the video process, I would assume he wanted it this way and not so cleaned up.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is mainly dialogue-based that comes out clear but if there is one thing that does come clear on your speakers and really stands out is the music by Don Ellis.  \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" is known for its jazzy music, so the brass horns definitely come out clear through your surround sound.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This is where \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" shines.  This Blu-ray is just filled with special features on two discs.<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * William Friedkin introduction to \\"The French Connection\\" -  The director of \\"The French Connection\\" William Friedkin introduces the film but also returns back to the area he filmed the movie and talks about how we will see former cast and crew on the special features.<br />  * Commentary by William Friedkin - I really enjoyed William Friedkin's commentary.  No pausing, just pretty much sets up the film of what's going on and quickly adds certain behind-the-scenes info. on the scenes.  Well done!<br />  * Commentary by Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider - I was so excited for this commentary but it's not what I was expecting.  Unfortunately, Roy Scheider passed away in 2008 and the two didn't do a commentary together in the past DVD's.  But you do get Gene Hackman talking about his experiences on \\"The French Connection\\" and then Roy Scheider talking about his experiences.  Gene Hackman on the first 40 or so-minutes and Roy Scheider in the final 40-minutes or so.  They are not commenting on a scenes as it is being played but just offering commentary on the whole experience.<br />  * Trivia Track - While watching the film, interesting tid-bits of the film are shown at the bottom.<br />  * Isolated Score Track - For those who love Don Ellis's music in the film, you can strictly isolate the score if needed.<br />  * Enhances for D-Box Motion Control Systems - For those who have D-Box Motion Control capability.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - With optional commentary, William Friedkin talks about certain scenes he cut out.  Most of the scenes were showing different sides of \\"Popeye\\" Doyle.  How the man really didn't have much friends and sometimes ends up speaking to the informants (like they were buddies), a scene of how Doyle would twist the law to pick up women he fancied,  an S&M scene involving Pierre Nicoli and more.<br /><br />  * Anatomy of a Chase - The chase scene in \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" is what the film will be remembered.  One of the biggest car chase scenes was from the film \\"BULLIT\\" produced by Philip D'Antoni.  Antoni produced this film and his mandate was that the chase scene MUST be better than \\"BULLIT\\".  So, Friedkin felt that having a car chase an L-train bus in New York City with all cars and people was amazing.  For one, it can't be duplicated in this age but literally both William Friedkin, DOP filmed this scene without the place being blocked out.  Because Egan and Grosso were well known with the NYPD, they informed their officers a car chase scene was being filmed.  But the actual scene was so dangerous because the cars were going 90 MPH and in one scene (that was used), a car being driven by Gene Hackman was hit by a guy who was leaving to go to work.  Hackman was hit and ended up wrapping the car in a pole.  Hackman and the cameraman were lucky to survive without serious injuries but that was how difficult this scene was.  Friedkin wanted a car weaving around cars and eventually, several times, the stunt cars actually hit them.  So, a very interesting and informative featurette!<br />  * Hackman on Doyle - It is well known that Gene Hackman's career was born because of this film but what many don't know is that he wanted to quit at one time.  To play Doyle, Hackman had to learn Eddie Egan's way of doing things.  His mindset.  That includes beating up people, calling them the \\"N\\" word and also he had to go on ride a longs with both Egan and Grosso to see how they worked.  Hackman was so shocked about the police life and he was so distraught that he didn't know if he could play the part.  He and Egan were like oil and water and in fact, Egan didn't want Hackman to play him.  But Hackman managed to pull it off and win an Academy Award.<br />  * Friedkin and Grosso Remember the Real French Connection - In this scene, director William Friedkin and Sonny Grosso (the detective that Roy Scheider's character was based on) reunite to talk about the film and how it differs from how things actually happened in reality. Grosso does say that the film captured 90% of what he and Eddie experienced.  If anything is more surprising, which is shown in the last minute of the film but in relation to the film and reality is how all this hardwork from the NYPD, the criminals really never had to do a lot of time.  In fact, many were released and some were never caught.<br />  * Scene of the Crime - William Friedkin goes back to the area where Pierre Nicoli shoots at Doyle.  He visits the same building and the same area and what he was going for during the filming.<br />  * Color Timing the French Connection - William Friedkin and his video guy show examples of how Doyle wanted to get the colors he wanted for the final Blu-ray cut and how it was accomplished.  Thus you learn that Friedkin was very much involved with this Blu-ray disc video version.<br />  * Cop Jazz: The music of Don Ellis - Don Ellis is a jazz musician who was known but not very well-known until he did \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" and thus this featurette is a tribute to him.<br />  * Rogue Cop: The Noir Connection - Although James \\"Popeye\\" Doyle's way of handling things as a cop was very brash, this featurette goes through many films that precede \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" and other well-known cops on film that were \\"rogue\\".<br />  * BBC Documentary: The Poighkeepsie Shuffle - A lengthy documentary on \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\"  aired on BBC featuring interviews with the cast and crew of \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\".<br />  * Making the Connection: The Untold Stories of the French Connection - A lengthy documentary hosted by Sonny Grosso featuring interviews with the cast and crew of \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" came out on DVD for the first time, I was anxiously waiting for it.  And now, watching it on Blu-ray and just knowing how much was put into this release is just amazing.<br /><br />The film was avant-garde back in 1971.  Gritty, raw and it's a film that can't be made again.  The film showcases the racial profiling at that time and William Friedkin was able to pull of the unthinkable of stopping traffic in New York City to quickly get a shot, using Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso's connections to block out several blocks for a car chase scene with many people and cars still in traffic and it was such a guerrilla-style of filmmaking that was pulled off amazingly.<br /><br />But this Blu-ray showcases how things were not as peachy keen behind-the-scenes.  From getting the best-selling book to film, finding the right actors to play Egan and Grosso, making sure Friedkin, D'Antoni, Hackman and Scheider were involved in actual busts by Egan and Grosso and just making sure everything looked right.  And also the film had its certain mini-controversies between Hackman and Friedkin, Hackman and Egan, Friedkin's scene with Doyle and Nicoli at the end to problems within the film industry at the time, the film being turned down by so many film companies, turning down so many screenplays, so many actors to play a role and I can see why this film nearly never happened.  So, I found this all intriguing.<br /><br />The film was great to watch but what surprised me more is how much went into this Blu-ray disc.  Reuniting William Friedkin, Philip D'Antoni, Sonny Grosso and a few others to visit the various areas of where the film was shot, to talk with the crew and movie execs that helped make this film happen.  All of this is included on the Blu-ray.  Ten featurettes which the majority were all quite lengthy, commentary by Friedkin and also to see Gene Hackman, thankful for this film and to see people no longer with us such as Eddie Egan and Roy Scheider also having a part in this Blu-ray disc posthumously.<br /><br />This Blu-ray disc is everything a fan of \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" can want.<br /><br />It is the definitive version to own and the way William Friedkin wanted people to watch the film on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" on Blu-ray is fantastic!

0316010669|5.0|Extremely interesting examples how we react to information and have no idea that the process is occuring. The section on how we respond to cultural cues I found very eye-opening. The fact that someone who was aware of this phenomenon, took the Implicit Association Test every day, and yet discovered that the day that his score changed was a day he happened to watch a documentary on Martin Luther King Jr beforehand- which he didn't even realize until he sat down and analyzed what was different about that day. The flip side is the Warren Harding effect, where we make an assumption based on surface factors and never revisit the matter, often to our detriment. Again, just really thought-provoking. And the example of the way that women and black men are given rock-bottom car prices that are $750 to 1500 more on average than those given to white men is very eye-opening and practical information to have- not based on racism or sexism as such, and the salespeople have no idea they are doing this. You just need to read this book. Very good.
0307269752|4.0|This book was a great companion and medicine for my three days of bed rest.  There are multiple subplots with interesting history behind them and not only the main but also supporting characters are very intriguing and add more layers into the main plot.  My only disappointment is that there are a few facts that looked so promising in the beginning that turned out to be inconsequential in the end.  Nevertheless, this is a great mystery, very entertaining.  Very sad that the author died so young.
B001M72JC2|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and absolutely freaked over it.  I bought the DVD just to see the director's cut and it blew my mind.  I like the theatrical ending, but if you've already seen the film, the Director's Cut ties the movie together so brilliantly that you really understand what the writers were going for the whole time.    The Hi-Def Transfer looks amazing.  The Director used every film stock and camera lens to alter \\"reality\\" as the main character's universe kept taking different turns.  In one section of the movie, the colors burst from the screen in a way that film itself cannot achieve, but with digital technology, the tone and image of the film look better than I'd ever expected.  A must buy, I just wish there were more extras.
B000C3H4L8|5.0|Heavily fractured through a prism of art school irony and minimalism, all David Byrne ever really wanted to be was a pop star, a status he would only (semi-)attain a decade later when he slapped on the Big Suit. But, way back in '77, with a nod to pop instrumentalist Sergio Mendes, this album was the frankest manifesto of that aspiration. Its incredibly catchy songs defy you not to sing along in your own full-throated, geeky-gawky glory after about the second listen. If you think I'm a bit far-fetched, watch Byrne's only outing as a film director, True Stories, in which the common folk of Virgil, Texas, the General Public that Byrne is gently ribbing, nevertheless manage to gather for a night of karaoke and belt out.... a Talking Heads rocker. Even now, 30 years later, I still know all the words. Even then, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth were beginning their three-LP run as the greatest rhythm section of rock's post-punk era.
1416562605|5.0|Adiga's debut novel explodes off the pages and brings us the reality of modern India.  This is not your majestic and allegorical novel of India, like Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" -- full of beautiful sights and smells.  This is the real India, as seen from the under-belly of socity.  Adiga's novel jumps off the pages and punches you in the face -- exposing all the rawness of this Third World country -- anger, poverty, corruption, exploitation, wealth.  A debut novel doesn't get much better and original than this one.<br /><br />Whether you like this book or not, it certainly should generate a visceral reaction.  Adiga creates a memorable character in Balram Halwai, son of a rickshaw driver who is now car driver to Ashok Sharma, businessman from a well-off family involved in coal refining.  Balram spends seven nights writing a letter about his life to the premier of China who is about to visit India.  Balram wants to share his life story as evidence of the real India, not the the one the Premier is likely to see or be exposed to during his sheltered visit.  The story of Balram's life takes us on a whirlwhind emotional ride of laughter, sorrow, hope, loss,fear and anger, to name a few.<br /><br />\\"White Tiger\\" is likely to leave you gasping for air after the flurry of blows it delivers.  The only thing I wanted after reading this book is a counterpart for China -- laying bare the soul of the under-belly of that country -- in as marvelous a way that Adiga does for India.

B0017U7PT6|3.0|10,000 BC was an entertaining film with good special effects, interesting but one dimensional charactors and questionable acting efforts. I would, however, rate it as a three star film and enjoyed the story despite its lack of fidelity with what our scientists believe about history as revealed to us through science.

B00009NHC5|4.0|I am taking a course in Graphic Design (computer graphics) at a community college whose drama group is putting on the play \\"Wait Until Dark.\\"  We were given a project to design a poster for the play - the best would be used for publicity.  I did not see the movie when I was younger (I am retired and back in school for enjoyment) so I purchased the DVD to become familiar with the story.  I liked it.  It is a film in the Hitchcock tradition.  It's not like the modern \\"slasher\\" or action movies.  Instead, it grips you because the story relates to things that are much more plausible - by accident, anyone could be the target of nefarious people.  The acting is quite good, especially Audrey Hepburn.  I made the mistake of watching it on my computer while at school.  I would recommend watching it on a larger screen in a darkened room.  And just concentrate on the film; you need to let yourself get absorbed to get the full impact.
0891419195|5.0|This is without a doubt an amazing book.  EB Sledge's complelling tale of his experiences with the Marines of K/3/5 will put you right there with him and his buddies in the Pacific Theater of Operations.  This book is a must read for WWII enthusiasts.  I also highly recommend reading this book to any young person considering to join the armed forces, in particular the Marines.  Organizationally, things may have considerably changed within the forces but the cruel and savage nature of war will always be the same.  The book is also an excellent prelude to HBO's upcoming WW2 miniseries, The Pacific.

0143113100|5.0|This is the first book I've read on the subject of neuroplasticity and it definately won't be the last.  I find this book not only intriguing but inspiring.  After reading this book, I'm more convinced than ever of the importance and benefits of visualization and exercising the brain.    The author points out that neuroplasticity has been around for a long time but only recently it has been categorized and is getting more main stream support.  The stories contained herein are very inspiring.  There are examples of people who were able to make significant changes to brains even after physical damage has been done and even after they were told things are irreversible.  If people with severe brain defects can change and improve cognitive function, then what does this say about those of us who are normal?  It says that change is definately obtainable but not without hard work.  This book contains some very powerful information if it is used right.  Anyone interested in personal transformation/improvement should get this book and take it to heart.

B001PE26QQ|3.0|OK, I was originally going to give this a much lower star rating, but didn't want people to mistaken it as a negative review of the film itself, because it isn't, the film is a GREAT martial arts film. My low rating is the DVD itself. First thing I noticed is that the subtitles neglected to subtitle the words in the beginning credits. Now I'm not talking about the names, I'm talking about the first paragraph after the names right after you see him practicing Wing Chun, which tells the audience about the city and how it's known for being the origin of China's Nan Tian style of martial arts. And for that reason, it attracts martial artists from all over China to establish dojos and to exchange martial arts culture. It goes on to say that today Fuoshan (the town in the film where Ip Man is from) have become known as \\"THE TOWN\\" of martial arts. If you can't read Chinese, you won't know what that entire paragraph reads, and that's stupid because it's kind of important to the story.    The second thing I noticed is how poor the quality was. It's not so bad that it's unwatchable, but it's FAR worse than most DVD's I've owned.    Then the thing that made me stop watching this was the audio. For some reason they decided they didn't like the original audio stream and replaced it. But the first thing you'll notice is the volume. It's EXTREMELY low, you'll have to crank your system all the way up if you are to hear anything.    Then the next thing you'll notice is the bad syncing of the lips and of the fighting sound effects. The reason for this isn't apparent to those who don't know Chinese. But I do, I understand some Cantonese, which is a dialect of Chinese spoken most commonly by the \\"common\\" people, mainly from Canton. That is the language most of the people speak in this movie, except the Japs of course and those fighters from the North who spoke Mandarin. However, this is the reason why they redid the entire audio stream including the sound effects. They changed the audio from Cantonese to all Mandarin. I don't know why, perhaps this version was printed in China and they consider Mandarin the \\"official\\" dialect and kind of look down on Cantonese, Hakka, and other Chinese dialects.    To those who don't know the difference, this sucks because now the audio is too soft and the syncing is bad (you see a hit, then hear it, or vice versa) and they neglected to add back in some of the little verbal gestures Chinese people are known to make (like going \\"mmm\\" instead of actually saying yes, they did this in the original movie, but they omitted a lot of it in this print, instead, it's just silence).    But to those who understand Chinese, it also sucks because it takes the authenticity away since the film's locale's native language is Cantonese, so in real life, they would have been speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin, and people know this. That's why they had the inhabitants of this city speaking Cantonese and the fighters from the North that came down to challenge them spoke Mandarin. That is how it was and that is how they wanted to portray it. Now everyone spoke Mandarin and it's pretty annoying.    Either that or the Cantonese audio stream is so jarbled that I don't understand it. All I know is that when I first watched this movie, I understood almost all of it since I know Cantonese. When I bought this DVD, I couldn't understand any of it and had to use the subtitles... Not to mention I could barely hear it.    I don't know, the movie is a great movie, it is kind of like Fearless, but a little more historically accurate, Fearless was VERY inaccurate in terms of historical accuracy, this was a bit better, but the fighting is very different because this is Wing Chun, which is purely a close range fighting technique, which is where almost all fights end up anyhow so it's also the most practical of all martial arts in my opinion. You will almost NEVER get into a street fight where your opponent will stay a leg's length away from you so you can do Tae Kwon Do style kicks at them. That is completely unrealistic and exclusive to competition style fighting. In real fights, your opponent will tend to want to close the distance any chance he gets. So Wing Chun which focuses on close in, short arm fighting is perfect for that.    I suggest you watch this film, but I really would like to find a better print than this one, I know it exists because I've seen it not too long ago, a friend had it, but he doesn't have the box or anything and doesn't know what version it is.
B00061HJ4S|5.0|Tamiya has a history as a leader in the world and hobby of scale model building.  I have been a fan of Tamiya kits since the first one I built when I was 11 years old.  That was almost 41 years ago.  The detail on the model and on the soldiers is amazing and first rate.  From the handles that control the elevation and traverse of the gun to the weapons the soldiers have as their personal firearms, you can almost feel like you are there, preparing to fire this German 88mm gun.    You can never go wrong with a Tamiya kit.  For the price, you will always have an amzaing enjoyment in building one of their kits.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|WALL-E is one of Pixars BEST films to date. I heard some people say that there was an overt or over the top tree hugger message in it. I didn't see a tree hugger message in it at all. This is a love story, simple and plain. There are many applications you could pull from it to make all kinds of points if you really wanted to. But the simple story of WALL-E is a lonely robot who finds love and teachers her that the other robot that the JOB is not the most important thing. It was CUTE!
0316017922|5.0|Despite the category this book falls under (social science I guess?), It is a very enagaging and interesting read that you cannot put it down.<br /><br />It is rather a hopeful than disapointing message that you have to put in 10,000 hours to master your trade.<br />I know why I'm mediocre despite 10 years in my trade, a computer programmer, because I just didn't have the passion to put in nearly that much amount of time.... not even close if I accurately account the time I've spent in actual coding.  Of course, things are different now than the Bill Gate's day since I'm moving on from technology to technology.  It is like pianist suddenly moving to stringed instrument and so on.<br />Yet, it gives me a kind of hope that 10,000 hour rule could still be applied.  Not because of a couple of isolated cases he stated but I could kind of feel it and draw it out from my life experience.<br /><br />On the subject of nature vs nurture, where the environment, time plays such a huge role, it made my head noding in agreement.  It reminded me of what Solomon was saying in his book of ecclesiastes.  Not too much of a discouraging message though.  It just let you see how people, not too much different from you, could succeed or fail depending on the circumstances...so true.<br />The reason I'm not discouraged with that sort of deterministic thought is that now I could look at things in a bit more of a bird eyed view, where I could see, and at the risk of being overly optimistic, even take advantage of such situation...if not, at least, be able to understand a bit of what is happening to those who succeed and those who fail.<br /><br />Mid section of book where he talks about the southerners and airline accident was kind of dull read.<br /><br />Asian kids excells in Math was kind of intersting and I think holds a rice grain of truth.  But he totally missed mentioning The guy, Confucius!<br />I say rise and fall, good and bad of Asian all originated from that guy... Moral philosophy yet even some way plays like religion in asian culture...or...maybe I'm wrong :)<br /><br />Anyway, a good read and recommended!an culture...or...maybe I'm wrong :)    Anyway, a good read and recommended!
B001KEGRCA|4.0|I didn't see any description for this disk when writing this so here is a quick summary: The Colorado river is dwindling due to our ever expanding need for fresh water. Conservationist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and botanist Wade Davis (along with their daughters) and canyon guide Shana Watahomigie take an expedition to illustrate the need for changing the way the Colorado is exploited.    I haven't seen that many IMAX films on the Grand Canyon so I won't be able to give any real comparisons, but I will say this one does at least deliver on what I was looking for: Nice wide footage of the Grand Canyon. Although most of the footage is personal shots of the expedition you do get some really good aerial footage as well as other impressive nature shots.     The difference between this particular documentary and what I would normally expect from a Grand Canyon is that it has a conservation message tied to it. Instead of focusing solely on nature's wonder there is a lot of footage on the effects of drought and siphoning of the Colorado River. So if you are looking for a full-on nature safari this isn't exactly it. At the same time it's not like you aren't getting any absolutely amazing footage either. Just not as much as I was expecting.      Like many IMAX films coming to Blu-Ray the AVC transfer is breathtaking. Every little detail will stand out. The audio is equally immersive with the DTS HD MA 5.1 track getting you wrapped up in the sounds of the canyon all over. There is also a French DTS audio track. On the minus side there are no subtitles of any kind. There are a somewhat respectable list of extra features on this release, which I suppose it better than expected. Most of the extras are standard definition with the exception of one. Here is what you get:    - 30 Minute Making of Featurette    - Music video by Wade Davis' daughter, Tara    - Retrospective of MFF IMAX productions (in HD)    - Water saving tips and river clean up tips (sponsored by Kholer and Tava)    - Fact sheet on the Grand Canyon and Colorado River    - Trivia quiz (text)    Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk is a very worthwhile documentary that shows the real beauty of the Grand Canyon... if you don't mind the preachy parts. Of course conservationists will really appreciate the fact filled message as well as the eye candy. The IMAX theater release was also in 3-D, but I haven't heard of any releases on Blu-Ray or DVD that will take advantage of that anytime soon.

1582701709|5.0|I read this book a month after moving from South Africa to Australia, it made such an impression on me that I decided to study with one of the teachers, Bob Proctor - and am now enjoying a new career!  The principles in the book were similar to the ones I'd been raised with - but were put in such clear, fun ways that it was really easy to digest.<br />The audio's of The Secret are fantastic - I have listened to them over 80 times in the last year, and continue to hear something new.  The depth of the material, when you really listen - is substantial.<br />Is it a complete work?  Yes - and it also leads to further learning and studying into the other Laws, of which the Law of Attraction is only one.<br /><br />Easy to read in one sitting, easy to pick up and use as a reference book.  Easy enough to read to young adults, with depth to keep interest even with people of high awareness.  If you don't get the point of it, then perhaps you need to read it again?!

B001HUZYKI|4.0|Recently, I have been into reading books about extreme mountain climbing.  This book was excellent as it recounted a unbelievable story of survival.  The book talks about two climbers in the mountains but one ends up breaking a leg.  The two work together to get down the hill as quickly as possible, but in the end the healthier partner must cut the rope to save himself.  The other partner falls but does not die.  He begins to travel back to base camp with a broken leg.  He somehow crawls to his camp and is still alive in the end.  This does not happen on huge mountains.  The book is written from both mindsets or partners in this adventure.  One is eaten up with guilt and the other is doing everything possible to live.  These books are interesting to me because of my desire to climb Pike's Peak in Colorado.  They are inspirational as well as interesting.
031606792X|5.0|For me the whole series had ups and downs. It got a little corny mushy for me for a while but had enough pain and heartbreak, I think, to balance things out. The last book compensated for all the suffering Bella went through. I am thrilled that she got her wish and became a vampire. Sure it was one heck of a happy ending but hey, why not? Are we going to get everything turning out great 100% in real life? Probably not. But it sure is nice to read about it in a book:) I enjoyed the last novel tremendously.
0930289234|5.0|A complex and thought-provoking read, Watchmen is the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, published in 1986 by DC Comics, that changed the way people viewed comic books. Originally published as a series of twelve issues, the compiled series was one of the first to be called a graphic novel, along with the famous Dark Knight series by Frank Miller. The simple change from comic book to graphic novel was coupled with a darker and more realistic look at traditional comic subject matter - superheroes - and has led to widespread recognition of the literary merits of the medium.<br /><br />Watchmen is set in an alternative timeline late 1980s and revolves around the lives of a group of superheroes. While most of these crusaders are regular people who wear costumes to fight crime anonymously, there is one character with genuine superpowers - Dr. Manhattan - whose simple, impossible presence  has led to a vastly different world. America firmly won the war in Vietnam, Richard Nixon is still president, and the Cold War rages more fiercely, if more unevenly. The plot centers around these heroes now living in and attempting to cope with a ravaged society that has rejected their help, even when they still feel compelled to give it. This intricate world and wide cast of characters are revealed slowly throughout the novel, so richly detailed that new discoveries continue to appear on multiple read-throughs.<br /><br />Watchmen explores themes of violence, sin, justice, and the impulse to do right. This was one of the first comics to turn the superhero mythos on its head, questioning if heroes in any guise more help or harm societies. The art is detailed and incredibly expressive, with dark, moody colors, giving the story life and immediacy. In that it deals with superheroes dressed in silly costumes, has a male-dominated cast with a few attractive and scantily-clad females, and is bathed in violence, it holds to traditional comics, but it takes these aspects and turns them inside out, sharply critiquing each while offering a host of other issues, political and moral, to wrestle. While it has been the inspiration for a whole new genre of the gritty, tortured superhero trying to operate in a complicated, imperfect world, this original has substance and charisma to spare.m inside out, sharply critiquing each while offering a host of other issues, political and moral, to wrestle.

0099458322|3.0|Lovely writing but slow going. This is the first Murakami I've read, and I admit that I had a hard time making myself finish.<br /><br />There is a lot going for this book - the writing (and translation, really) is beautiful and smooth. The characters are interesting and distinct, there is a wealth of detail on culture and atmosphere, and the story is interesting. It was bizarre, but it was meant to be - the supernatural elements of the story were well-handled, for the most part. The back and forth sections between narrators, complete with changes between first- and third-person perspective, kept the story fresh.<br /><br />But while I was curious to see what happened, the story just took so long to become interesting that I was itching to move on to something else. I like character set-up, I really do, but it seems like half of this very long book is nothing but character set-up, and nothing of real significance happens for ages. The young main character is fifteen years old, and while the story hammers home (and hammers and hammers) how unusually mature he is, I still found it difficult to accept him as fifteen, in spite of that fact being integral to the story.<br /><br />The ambiguous and open-ended conclusion fit with the story, but it was also one more thing that had me grateful to move on to something with a little more pizazz. Good book, great writing, glad it's over.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Jason Statham. The name is synonymous with death-defying car chases, adrenalin-induced action, and his stoic face. Always that stoicism. Another take-down of another bad guy. Hero wins, if Jason Statham's characters can be called heroes.<br /><br />\\"Death Race\\" is no different. This time the \\"bad guy\\" is Joan Allen in a role shocking for the character's deep-down, never-fail evil nature. This is a Joan Allen stretched beyond her typical character actor roles. She should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress.<br /><br />Statham is set up for killing his wife, a cruel joke considering how much he loves her. The warden (Joan Allen) of the prison in this dystopian, post-apocalyptic world wants a replacement for Frankenstein, the winner of the Death Races for which her prison is notorious. She makes lots of money from selling each race to cable for the entertainment of millions. The original Frankenstein died from injuries. Statham is to replace him. That's why he was set up.<br /><br />This prison is a dark, dreary world of fierce men intent on harming anyone not in their little insulated prison gangs. Latinos. Blacks. Skinheads. And Jason joins what I call the Solitares who band together for the next death race.<br /><br />The one unrealistic (isn't it all?) piece of the film is the use of gorgeous female inmates as driving assistants, but their assets do add to the ratings. They dress provocatively. Yeah right! And no riot follows? More power to the warden and the inmates' fear of her.<br /><br />The race is brutal. Prison life is brutal. Everyone is brutal. People die. Ratings skyrocket. The warden smiles. Yet, Jason Statham is the driving force in the film. The viewer must know that what the warden expects will not happen. Worse. She cannot possibly see the ending. It's great.<br /><br />Don't miss this riveting vehicle for the machismo talent of Jason Statham and how he wins everything. The statement is not a spoiler because you don't have a clue just what he does or how. It's a must-see dark film for action-adventure, post-apocalyptic movie lovers.action-adventure, post-apocalyptic movie lovers.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|The movie starts off well enough with a nice car chase sequence that employs quick-cut scenes to convey adrenaline-pumping action, but it can be difficult to follow and I have to agree with critics' description of this approach as hypercut editing.  In fact, a few people left the theater after the movie starts off with its two signature action sequences utilizing this approach.  This unfortunately just underlines the problem with the film's pacing.  Marc Forster is well-regarded for his previous work on \\"Finding Neverland\\" and \\"Monster's Ball\\", but it is obvious that this is his first venture into action-film-making.  While I think it is a great idea for the production team to employ \\"Bourne\\" veterans to stage the action sequences, the movie was overly reliant on their approach and the aforementioned hypercut editing should have been a complement to the movie's style rather than its primary tool.<br /><br />  I defended Bond's state of mind and soulless demeanor as a vehicle in his early character development that would take him to the familiar suave, debonair spy he eventually becomes, but the portrayal of his motivated actions were inconsistent and rang hollow.  As referenced in the title of this review, this was a greatly missed opportunity to memorably add to and definitively establish his early beginnings in James Bond canon.  It is all the more disappointing when you consider the serial core cast--Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, and Jeffrey Wright--was at the top of its game and that there were some intriguing story elements that could have been delved into more or at least handled better to have the audience empathize more with James Bond's inner demons.  This might be attributed to a rushed script that was turned in before the writers strike in order to meet production deadlines.<br /><br />  Being a sequel to the storyline from the indelible \\"Casino Royale\\", there was a perfect set up to finish Bond's emotional journey but instead it seems like the movie was more interested in hastily ending that part of his life so that it can move onto his next.  \\"Quantum of Solace\\" even tries to emulate its predecessor with an ending to signify the birth of the Bond the world knows and loves.  However, it is executed unconvincingly not only in that particular scene, but also in the buildup throughout the whole movie.  It would have been better off for \\"Royale\\" to serve as a standalone end story rather than have \\"Solace\\" expand on it in such a paint-by-numbers fashion.<br /><br />  As much as \\"Casino Royale\\" took a quantum (pun intended) leap in re-invigorating the Bond franchise with a classic telling of Bond lore, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" stumbled with a couple of mis-steps back with an unfulfilling product that won't necessarily hurt the franchise but does indicate a possible return to the uninspired, formulaic approach to  making James Bond movies.<br /><br />  It's funny how a previous reviewer mentions paying attention to detail in order fully appreciate this movie because I feel this movie would be better enjoyed if the audience would gloss over the details.  In fact, if you compare the end scene of \\"Casino Royale\\" with opening scenes of \\"Quantum of Solace\\", you'll notice the suit Daniel Craig was wearing is different as Bond donned a Brioni suit in CR but a Tom Ford suit was shown in QoS.<br /><br />  I'm still glad I saw the movie but it comes off as superfluous and if I had to give it a grade, it'd get a C+ with the plus only added due to being somewhat related to the previous Bond outing, which I obviously have a high affinity for.erested in hastily ending that part of his life so that it can move onto his next.  \\"Quantum of Solace\\" even tries to emulate its predecessor with an ending to signify the birth of the Bond the world knows and loves.

B0000011P7|4.0|This is dark and brooding electronica, sparse and minimalist. Easily the least accessible and most evocative music that Anderson has ever made. Hey, what's not to love?    Based on interviews, it seems to me that Anderson has an introverted personality. This is the one album in which we clearly hear his personal voice. There are no silly histrionic gestures or schoolboy antics here. It's a sad, insane world we live in, and this album dwells on that fact.    It's not all gloom and doom, however. The title track \\"Walk Into Light\\" seems pretty life-affirming, being all about conquering one's fears and getting on with the show. But really, the best bits of this album are the sad bits: \\"Black and White Television,\\" \\"Looking for Eden,\\" and \\"Different Germany.\\"    The tracks to be deleted: anything trying to sound popular and radio-friendly. That certainly includes \\"Trains.\\" Even worse, there's the dreaded \\"User-Friendly.\\" It's unintentionally funny, and not just because the references to technology are outdated. The puns and strained metaphors are truly cringe-worthy.    But even so, where this album shines, it REALLY shines. It's better to succeed with two thirds of the songs rather than none at all. Several reviewers compared \\"Walk Into Light\\" to \\"Under Wraps.\\" In my opinion, the latter album it just about as ersatz, uninspired, and mechanical is it could possibly be. Although these two albums employ similar technology, the songwriting and arrangements couldn't be more different.

From the earlier years of Burn The Priest to the newer \\"radio metal\\" that you heard a lot of on Sacrament, this cd has it all.  Chris Adler blows away previous performances on the drums.  The same can be said for the guitars of Willie, John, and Mark.  And finally, Randy has raised the growling bar on this cd.  This cd is a great piece of work, and I think any metal lover should definitely pick it up.

B001P9KR8U|2.0|Over hyped to the Max!  If you buy this movie because of all its Oscar wins you will be really disappointed.  This Movie was not very interesting and culturally it is so different in it's approach that most Americans will have a hard time watching it, unless of course you like Movies that break out into Song and Dance and Characters who almost never speak.<br /><br />What this movie's Oscar wins are all about is a an attempt by Hollywood to put out their  right hand in a Gesture of acceptance to Bollywood so that they can finally get their left hands into there wallets!<br /><br />It's horrible that movies Like Batman, Frost Nixon and Benjamin Button get very little acknowledgement and movies like this Win everything. No wonder so many of us have stopped watching the Oscars.<br /><br />Save your money and buy a copy of Frost Nixon or Batman and let them know what you really think of the Oscars.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This movie took my breath away when I saw it, I couldn't believe the amount of hidden messages in the movie, every time I see it I keep finding something I missed the last time I saw it, you gotta love the persistence of Wall-E, all he wanted to do is to hold her hands and Eve blaming Wall-E for you know what (then again what women doesn't do that?) You can't go wrong with this movie, I mean it just recently won a Oscar award for best Animated movie, what else you have to say? I have this for BluRay and DVD format, I'm wondering what was going on Pixar's mind about the packaging, I mean just because it's a great movie doesn't mean we aren't going to mind it, I put my DVD format in the back w/the BluRay casing. In the end if you watch this movie, and you don't smile or laugh there's gotta be something wrong with ya... Enjoy the movie! (Make sure to watch the extras like Presto's Alec the bunny & magician and BURN-E!)

0375703764|5.0|The most unique book I have ever read. It is hard to describe how stunning this book truly is.
0143038419|1.0|I decided to buy this book after picking up a copy and reading the first couple of pages where she has the hots for her language exchange partner. It was sexy and fun. From there she starts into her life challenges (namely divorce) and I valued the humorous way she was able to touch on very heavy subjects. I decided I really liked her and would look forward to reading not only this book, but her future books as well. I was smitten. You know that feeling, the joy of finding a new author you can fall in love with? Well, just like in so many crushes, I fell out of love with her too.     The first several times that she held a pity party in the pages of her book, I not only attended, I brought party favors, laughed at her jokes, and offered kleenex. The problem was that she kept hosting them and nothing ever changed. She never became more enlightened. She was self-absorbed and naive. It turned out, by somewhere in the chapters on India, I couldn't stand her. Reading her words grated on my nerves. I was backpacking and her pages were dead weight in my pack and reading her voice was taking my time away from more important things. I ended up leaving the book in a hotel somewhere in the south of India to annoy the next person.     To all those that would say, oh you missed the Bali section, you don't know how great it turned out! I did skim the Bali section. Certainly enough to get the idea of it and find she had the same voice.     Here's the deal, if you value your time, find something else - there are better reads out there. This one is particularly disappointing to start because it gets worse the more you read.     I hope this is helpful.

B000F5GNX8|5.0|If you like a quick witted and fast talking dialogue- this is sure to please! Robert Downey Jr. is at the top of his game playing a petty thief turned actor/PI. Val Kilmer acts as his coach in the life of being a PI- discovering unexpected twists and turns as they team up. Worth a try!
193413712X|1.0|A very laborious and slow read, with characters shifting back and forth  between father and son with no well-defined transitions.  Cannot recommend.
1400082773|5.0|This is a stunningly well written book by man in this early thirties trying to sort through the many experiences and relationships that have  contributed to his hard-won sense of identity. It's almost inconceivable  that someone so young could have achieved the wisdom to both understand and forgive those who'd hurt him, and also learned to write like this. Barack Obama renders with novelistic flare his family members and the many he worked with in his early days as a community organizer. He not only comes to grips with his own story, he knows how to tell it in a way that keeps the reader avidly turning the pages. Anyone who wants to undertand what President Obama went through in becoming the man that he is should read this book.
B001ED7C58|5.0|You may want to hold out and get the version with the bonus tracks, especially if you like Rob Pattinson. It doesn't have \\"Let Me Sign\\" on this version and it's not available as a single on iTunes yet. If you want that song you have to download the whole thing again.
B000ION23A|5.0|Excellent movie, I strongly recommend it.  The performances were magnificent, Julia Robert, Nicolas Cage, all of them, and of course, Zack Tyler Eisen, he is so young, and did and excellent job and has a great voice.  I highly recommend this movie, to young and all... Enjoy!
B0018CMJSU|3.0|I agree with Unlucky Frank. I bought the new transfer because I thought it would be easier to tune than the original. It is not easier to tune. The yellows are very difficult to control. Some scenes need black enhancement, other scenes are too dark. The few scenes that don't need special video settings are no better than the original DVD.    Both DVDs are difficult. I see no reason to put money into buying the new one.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Amazon always provides the most current DVD's at the best prices. My purchase of Black Hawk Down in Blu-ray only furthered this experience for me.      I already own Black Hawk Down on standard DVD format.  The Blu-ray version blew it out of the water.  I mean to pieces.  The visuals and sound rocked the room my friends and I watched it in.  It was riveting.  You can't go wrong with this movie, the Blu-ray version and using Amazon for all of your purchasing needs--they're all winners in my book.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Our family really enjoys playing Blokus. It is the game of choice when asked to play a game. We have the hexagon as well as the square flat versions.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I have been a fan of the show since the beginning. This is the only show I ever bought on DVD. There are always interesting extras and additional material included on the DVDs. The only thing that bothers me is that we are still charged an arm and a leg for a shorter season.
0670020745|4.0|My father had a stroke in 2001. It was so severe that left him for a long time now in a vegetative state. Its a unique book in the way the author discusses her personal experience with useful observation to her own state of mind and thinking at the time of a stroke. Very easy read it gets emotional on some occasions and gives you a different angle toward dealing with your own injured person if you have one.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|death race is a movie full of action, thrills and spills. It is different to the every day jail movies, that has the comment of \\"O just another one of those jail movies again\\". I think that because the warden who is played by a female has you kind of thinking that women are just as capable of being deviant as men if not more so. Recommended viewing to see for your self.
B001F0TM5I|5.0|This movie starts out slow. It has the old looking film that takes you back to the great drive-in movies of the mid to late 70's. At first you are thrown by this. Then you meet Kurt Russel's character who is totally over the top but in a fun way. He is so crazy that you wonder what he will do next. When you meet (THE BABES) You really are not seeing them as any competition for him. Then it all comes together in one of the best and longest car chase scenes you will ever see. The real kicker to this movie is Zoe Bell (she is a stuntwoman ) and when you see the movie you think wow I wonder who actually had the you know what to really film that. Well it was her. That is one of the best things about this film is knowing she did it all.
B0011UCOGG|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. Paolini has outdone himself.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian is straight to the point.  Her no-nonsense, tough and straight forward approach is different, in a good way, from other instructors on many workout videos.  Her job is to motivate and train not to be a cheerleader which because evident immediately.  Right away she states that great results do not come for free.  If you are down for a challenge then this is the DVD for you.  I am still on level one and am using this program strictly to stay toned.  Having the three workout levels on one DVD is great and saves money.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|This is my first Animal Collective record I've purchased and I'm an instant fan. Think of Pink Floyd meets MGMT meets The Flaming Lips. By far my favorite purchase of 2009. Go for the vinyl. It is nice quality 180g and worth every penny.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The Bourne series never gets old, and this is the cherry atop the trilogy (but there could be more movies!)... the Bourne Ultimatum was a tough movie to perfect because the previous two had set very high bars and everyone was worried that it would disapoint. It did the opposite. The Ultimatum continued with nail-biting action, packed more suspense, and answered many questions while raising more. You never get bored, its really not predictable, and twists and turns make it a GREAT thrill ride. It a keeper. BUY IT!!!
B00005JLIU|4.0|I love me some Julie Andrews, and so I was really excited about this movie.  It just sounded so fresh and funny and charming, and that all came from a simple film synopsis.  So, I found it and watched it and I have to say that it was totally charming, pretty funny and at least contained a smattering of fresh to say the least.  It isn't perfect (not many films are) but it has very little to pick at when you look at this venture as the fun filled romp it was meant to be.<br /><br />So we have Millie Dillmount, a young `modern' girl trying to find the right job with the right boss to make her dreams come true (she's planning on marrying her boss so that she has financial stability).  She lives in a hotel owned by the strange and devious Miss Flannery who is actually running a slavery ring out of her hotel, praying on pretty orphan girls.  When Dorothy Brown moves in (orphan) she becomes the next unsuspecting victim.  Meanwhile, Millie meets and falls for an apparent slacker named Jimmy Smith but she resists him the best way she can while trying to woo her handsome boss Trevor Graydon, who just so happens to have a thing for Dorothy.<br /><br />At times the film can seem a little messy (the conflicting plot points of the love triangle and the slavery ring can get a little confusing and or irritating) but it works hard to work itself out, and it always manages to bring a smile, even in it's most preposterous of scenes.<br /><br />Across the board the acting is sublime, especially from the films star, Julie Andrews.  Her comedic touch is just intoxicating to say the least, and her charm goes on from scene to scene.  This was originally slated to be a Mary Tyler Moore vehicle and was supposed to launch her into that whole `romantic comedy' genre, so I'm a little sorry that this proved to be see Andrews focused for the mere fact that I love me some Moore as well, but really, Andrews is so good here you have to forgive her for stealing Moore's spotlight.  Moore is good, but rarely steps up the way she could have.  Carol Channing and Cavada Humphrey on the other hand make the most of their supporting roles by adding layers of comedic genius to their scenes.  Channing went on to receive an Oscar nomination for her role here, and it's easy to see why.  James Fox is sincere and amusing as Andrews' love interest, and John Gavin is effectively dopey as her clueless boss.<br /><br />I wish the film had a little more focus in areas because it could have been superb if it had.  I actually loved most everything up till the very end where it seemed to drag while it tried to tie up every lose end (remember, it has two central plot points to tend with).  I also thought that the revelation concerning Muzzy and two other central characters was a bit of a stretch (an absurd one at that) but what is a comedy without a little absurdity.<br /><br />Yes, regardless of its faults, `Thoroughly Modern Millie' manages to remain entertaining and watchable thanks to its unique mix of film noir, comedic musical and even silent era moviemaking.  This is a surefire good time that will bring a smile to anyone's face.she could have.

B0002VKZTI|5.0|This album originally issued in 1978 (31 years ago) doesn't sound too dated and it has very interesting points here and there.  Somebody reviewed that Eumir started to slip after this release (what?) after this one he recorded 4 more albums back to back that hit both markets: Jazz and Disco-Funk with a hammer: (Knights of Fantasy - Night Cruiser - Happy Hour and Motion) besides this particular album had hits on both categories; for Jazz you have (Tahiti Hut - San Juan Sunset & Take the A Train) and for Disco-Funk (Area Code 808 & Whistle Bump).  Anyway, as customery, check Eumir's distinguished list of guests for this  jewel:  - Eumir Deodato / Keyboards, Synthesisers, Vocals, Percussions, Compositions, Arrangements  - Larry Carlton / Acoustic & Electric Guitars  - John Tropea / Guitars  - George Benson / Guitars  - Victor Feldman / Percussions  - Erica Norimar / Vocals  - Phillip Bailey / Percussions, Flute, Horns  - Al McKay / Guitars  - Verdine White / Bass  - Harvey Mason / Drums  and many more.................    Very recommedable if you collect Deodato's music, all that Jazz-Funk with his right dash of Brazilian spices.

B001IZGPJG|4.0|To all Enigma's fans - in my point of view, this latest music video from Enigma is the best so far since Remember The Future. If you look at the video and listen to the music, you can scent and feel right away that this is the true Enigma's work of art. Is very original and different from the earlier album even though some of the sound and music extract from some of its earlier music. But still as a whole, it makes you think that Enigma has done a great job. The only thing that this DVD does not have is the bonus music video from Disc 2 (Seven Lives Many Faces - Special Edition 2 CDs) which have great music like \\"Superficial\\" and \\"We Are Nature\\". That's the reason why I gave 4 stars out of 5 stars. Anyway, as I have said earlier, this is still the best music video from Enigma so far. Please take note that there is 1 music video which is inappropriate for children, and that is \\"Touchness\\" which have lesbian scene in it. Just like the music video from \\"Gravity of Love\\" and \\"Principle Of Lust\\". So parents, please be aware before you watch \\"Touchness\\". Thank you.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|ENTERTAINMENT!  I was dragged to this movie by my girlfriend who always attends the guy films and so I went to see this \\"chick flick\\", which was my understanding. I think this was a true love story and one of possibilities, one of hope. I saw this movie and was entertained. I give this movie 5 stars and truly understand why it won 8 Academy Awards, it didn't have that Hollywood feeling. Even though the whole story was fake, it made me wish that at least some parts were real and isn't that what movies are supposed to do?   This movie made me, laugh, winch, cringe, cheer, jump, laugh some more and finally... DANCE! This was a great freaking movie! 5 Stars!
0143114085|4.0|This was an interesting book - in all facets, really - a neat structure, fascinating premise, surprising twists and turns to the plot... the only thing really lacking were the characters. Not anything terribly specific, but... I guess they seemed more like characters from a film than from a book. They were a bit two-dimensional, which is odd considering the book is labeled as \\"psychological thriller.\\" Some actions were rather unbelievable. I do think it would make a good movie, though - perhaps even better than the book. There was just something film-like about reading the book. Maybe because some actors jumped to mind as being perfect to play parts (e.g., Judi Dench as Vivienne). It was a solid story and quite entertaining and if only the characters had that certain je ne sais quoi, I would have truly loved it.
0743297334|4.0|Some have pigeonholed, or even criticized Hemingway as having a sparse, almost vague style. I, for one, am grateful that he does not think his reader naive - does not spoon feed us. In his description of sense, he is generous. How could we know the taste of a wine or the texture of a bullfighter's cape without being there? On the other hand, given the intentional interactions between his characters and the delicate choosing of their words, how can we not know what isn't being said? It's all there - particularly in this novel - cloaked only in the reservedness of the era. The tensions set just below the surface, as well as the simple joys (and sorrows) of four expats seeking escape at the fiesta in Pamplona are what make the book so satisfying, and what have kept its place in literary history secure. What fiction.
0330367412|1.0|As a Vietnam vet I was quite disappointed with this book. It appears the author was on drugs while writing it. It's not well written and hard to follow. Save your money and your time.

B000RW3YYA|5.0|I am really enjoying this series and Season Three shows that it just keeps getting better and better.  I love how creative the problems are, the ingenuity of the 'bad' guys.  And the solutions are not the standard \\"we are evolved beings and can solve anything\\" mindset -- especially with Rodney MacKay, the know it all scientist, to solve them, well, almost always, it's a lot of fun.  Good comedy mixed in with great drama and action.  My suggestion would be to start the series from the beginning, as you can get a little lost in some of the plots otherwise.

0452289963|5.0|Many of these negative reviews say much more about the writers themselves than about A New Earth and Eckhart Tolle. What difference does it make whether Tolle's ideas are from Buddhist writings? The point for me and apparently for many others is that Tolle has made these useful ideas accessable. He's presented them in a way that resonates with many of us who would probably have never come around to this way of thinking otherwise.That's what writers do. They deliver ideas to us. Those of us who are wrapped up in ego can find countless ways to criticize. Feels good, doesn't it? Pumps up that ego and puts another layer of self-righteousness between you and the Now. Makes you think you exist. I'll take Eckhart's way any day. It works, bottom line. All else is superfluous. Give this book, or The Power of Now a chance, and you just might find \\"the peace that passeth all understanding.\\" I did.

0375842209|5.0|They say that some books can be life changing or at least change the way you look at certain things,or ideas.The Book Thief is such a book.It tells a story in such a way that it will remain with you long after you have finished the book.The narrator of the story is somewhat unusual to say the least,and the characters are both tragic and triumphant.  It is set in Nazi Germany in the years leading up to and including the war.It presents a view from the other side.Read this book ,you won't be disapointed

0679442790|4.0|Michael Berg is fifteen years old when he is diagnosed with Hepatitis.  During a difficult bout of the disease, Michael falls ill on his way home, where a woman rescues him.  The woman is Frau Schmitz, a thirty-six-year-old \\"spinster\\" who works as a tour guide.  Michael pays her a visit to thank her for helping him.  Before he knows it, he embarks on a sexual relationship with the mysterious, taciturn woman who calls herself Hanna.  During their affair, they do two things -- they have sex and he reads to her.  Hanna loves to be read to, and Michael derives a certain pleasure from pleasing her.  But then one day she disappears -- not to be seen again until a day in court, where she is accused of a heinous crime.  Is Hanna involved in Nazi-related crimes?  Had she been hiding in Michael's town for a reason?  Hanna, the beautiful blonde who had seen Michael as nothing more than a sexual object, is finally revealed to him in her true colors.<br /><br />This is a unique and beautifully told story set during the late thirties and early forties.  Bernhard Schlink wrote this in German, I think, and Carol Brown Janeway translated it into English.  I hope nothing was lost in translation because this story is very enthralling and I'd hate it if the original had been written better.  In any event, Janeway wrote this with clear and lyrical prose and I couldn't put this book down as Michael told us about his love affair with an older woman.  I haven't seen the film this book is based on.  Needless to say, I look forward to watching it, especially after Kate Winslet (who happens to be one of my favorite actresses) won an Oscar for this role.  I can't recommend this enough.  Read it and enjoy it iff you haven't given it a whirl.
0553807048|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a book from cover to cover in one sitting.  Belfort's writing style is laugh out loud entertaining.  He shows his frailties and describes others with extreme candor.  And the book's  subject matter is extremely relevant today. Belfort may just be a blip compared to today's crooks( although he did it with more panache - and with more self destructive tendencies), but his book explains very well the mind set of greed, excess and entitlement on Wall Street.

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I was just channel surfing one night and I flipped on a movie channel playing this movie.  It was at the point where Mark&eacute;ta had just stopped to talk to Glen about his music playing on the street.  About why he played other people's music and not his own.  Something about their interaction caused me to pause on this channel to learn more about them.  I was in for a treat.  I was hooked on their interest in each other, which in turn, lead to love, but not fulfilled. And the music was so enriching, I had to buy the video and the album.  This movie will grow into a folk story.  I hope they do another \\"Once II\\" about these two people.  MUST SEE
B001JNND9W|5.0|C'mon, you already own the movie on DVD, what are all these reviews of the DVD version doing here?<br /><br />What's on the Blu-ray? That's what you want to know.<br /><br />Okay, worth the price of admission alone; a new HD 20-minute documentary on the film including interviews with Barry Newman (Kowalski himself), Sarafian (the director), musician Chris Cornell (?!), and ... wait for it ... the naked chick on the motorcyle ... today. Well, maybe you want to skip that visual to keep your memories (and her petite mammaries) vivid in your mind, but it was a noble thought (except for the part about the blisters).<br /><br />Love the car? Another brief documentary has car enthusiasts, including the legendary George Barris, talking about the 1970 Challenger. I loved finding out that the HP was specifically down-graded to 426 so it could be marketed as a street vehicle, when it was really a drag strip monster with 500 HP, and almost impossible to control at high speeds. Kudos to the stunt driver (Why isn't he on here? Let me guess ...)<br /><br />There's a trivia quiz you can take while watching the movie. And there's this strange graphic you can add to the watching of the movie where you are looking at it over a graphic of the actual dashboard of the car. Sort of like Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or whatever it's called). I wouldn't recommend it though, if you want to actually enjoy the pristine quality of the high definition remaster, which is beautiful, especially for an early 70's vintage film where, more often than not, the cinematographer was just as stoned as the cast, the picture could often be out of focus, and the ackward zoom shots could make you hurl.<br /><br />But forget all that, here is the ultimate anti-authority finger-up-in the-air-to-the-police epic. Pop the clutch and get down to your local Brick and Mortar media store (they're sinking fast) and pick it up!
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I had previously ordered this CD, which is rather hard to find, from someone in Australia who said it took 2-3 weeks to ship.  After a month, I gave up waiting and the seller was kind enough to refund everything.  I re-ordered and received the CD in only a few weeks.  The CD is as described, new, and is wonderful, and it came in a very timely fashion.  The seller was great in getting it to me!
0307387178|3.0|A young, upper class, white guy living this way is an idealistic wanderer.  A middle aged, overweight white guy living this way is a creepy drifter.      I understand the desire for \\"something more\\" and even the need to go on a spiritual journey, but the protaganist also embodies the self absorption and narcissism that can taint such things.  The truth is that there are other, better, healthier ways to do these things.  I, for example, volunteered at Covenant House Alaska for a year.  Did I die?  Nope.  Did I contribute?  Yep.  Did I have an awesome experience?  Sure.    Like the writer, don't like the kid.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This series is the closest that I have seen to the real thing!<br />As a Marine that's been there, I can tell you that because some of the actual members of 1st Recon helping out/acting in the series there is virtually no difference between the series and the real thing.<br />One thing to note is that some people have given this series a \\"1 star\\" for showing civilian deaths, the reactions to them, the vulgarity and the overall apathy to everything by the members of 1st Recon during the invasion. Ladies and Gentlemen, if you don't want the truth, please don't watch this, watch one of the many other series and movies that have gotten the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars completely incorrect and full of political views.<br />For a service member looking for a good laugh, or a civilian trying to immerse themselves into the life of a Recon Marine during OIF I this is the perfect thing for you.

I was satified with the Yardage Pro, but the Tour V2 is much faster at acquiring the yardage and feels better in my hand. I love the fact that it will fit in a golf cart cup holder and that I can use it with one hand. I also like the carrying case better. For me it is an indispensable golf tool.

B000063JDE|1.0|I make it a point to see hundreds of films from virtually every genre, and I judge them good or bad primarily on the basis of how convincing the acting is, how believable the plot line, and whether or not the film generally avoids kitsch and cliche.  Like most people, I usually agree with the critics (except when they seem to under- or overrate a film based on colleagues' opinions), and it was Blue Velvet's widely positive reviews that moved me to see it.    I have never been left so convinced of critics' tendency to jump on the overrating bandwagon.  Overall, the film is atrocious, with it's absolutely last-rate acting being its worst feature.  I'll never forget a few of the more glaring examples of hokum, including a scene when McLachlan's character turns to his sweetheart and begs, \\"Why, Sandy?  Why are there people like (Dennis Hopper's villainous character) Frank in this world? Why oh why?!\\"  Or the numerous instances when Laura Dern's character insists -- through halting sobs -- to go along on Jeffrey's oh-so-dangerous detective missions (\\"No, Sandy!  It's TOO dangerous!  I care about you TOO much!\\").      Awful.  Just awful.    The last scene is brief, but it really captures the essence of this film: the happily united and reconciled protagonists huddled together, grinning knowingly and sighing contentedly in unison, staring blissfully out of the kitchen window at a bird perched on the rail...    Bad enough in itself, but then you can't help but notice the wires sticking out of the mechanized bird!    And that about sums it up.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Again, I can't say how pleased I am with the quality of the product I ordered.  These purchases are quick to turning me into a life-long customer!
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff was gone to the world long before his time, but the songs and legacy that he leaves behind for us are wonderful.  Although it doesn't contain my favorite Buckley song, that would be \\"Vancouver\\" from Sketches, Grace is by far his greatest accomplishment, and one of the greatest accomplishments in music; ever.  Jeff plays guitar like a madman at times and a minstrel at others.  He was just a genius with the axe in his hand.  And his voice is one in a million.  How he can go from a coo to a scream to a chant in the same stanza is hypnotic.  This energy that Buckley projects can be seen in the beautiful \\"Grace\\" and the smashing \\"Eternal Life\\".  His beauty and skill can be seen in \\"Last Goodbye\\" and the wonderfully well done version of \\"Hallelujah\\", one of the best songs ever written.  However, I feel to truly grasp what Jeff was about as a person and a singer/songwriter, all you have to do is drown yourself in the beauty of the album's best track, \\"Dream Brother\\".  Do not let this gem slip you by.  Honor Mr. Buckley and his legacy by listening and enjoying the music on GRACE.  Peace and Love,  Jake

Too many times in the past I got burned because I liked a song or two and went out and purchased the CD only to find that the rest of the CD was worthless. I was hesitant about buying this one. I couldn't listen to all the songs I didn't know but knew I like a few of them. I went ahead and bought it anyway. Boy, was I happy I did! I love this whole CD. I've played it over and over. I highly recommend it!
B001H5X7I4|3.0|Well, Tropic Thunder didn't win anything Sunday night. But that doesn't take away the fact that Robert Downey was the funniest thing in this movie. He an Aussie playing a white American playing An African-American soldier. Actually its a movie about a movie about Vietnam. Do I have that right? Anyway, it goes horribly wrong, deadly & at times offensively funny. Therefore, everybody in Hollywood wanted to have a cameo in it. Apparently everyone in Hollywood loves Ben Stiller. The audience at the Academy Award was laughing uproariously at his antics as a presenter. Sorry. He's just not very funny. But that just me. Lot's of Hollywood insider stuff in this movie that I didn't get either. Plenty of starpower in this mediocure, at best, movie.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This movie shows the attack from the perspective of both sides. It goes into great detail in showing the Japanese planning and execution of the attack and also how the US forces knew Pearl Harbor was vulnerable to air attack, but did little to prevent it. Washington's culpability in not giving their Hawaiian commanders access to the most detailed information on Japanese intentions is also covered.
B001G9F9IW|3.0|The cinematography was beautiful, the stars were big-name, but why the budget sound?  Most Blu-ray disks have at least 5.1, often uncompressed, and often 6.1 and 7.1 channels.  Stereo two-channel sound just didn't meet my expectations.    Many of us buy because of the rear cover blurb.  This one described the movie as a \\"sexy romantic comedy\\".  Well it was romantic, sexy - if you like three-ways and lesbian sex, but I guess it's funny only if you live in Manhattan.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|i got the sample on my kindle, read it, then immediately bought the book, read it, then I called everyone  knew and told them they had to buy the book.  I laughed until I cried, I cried until I laughed. This is a magnifcent book.  I fell in love with the characters and actually said bad words when it ended.  I wanted to watch them grow old darnit! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is breathing!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|After being disappointed by movies in general over the past year, I was very pleased and surprised by Wall-e.  Who knew robot love could be so beautiful?!  The visually stunning effects of Disney/Pixar were compelling, the characters completely adorable and the plot believable and age defining of our throw-away society.  In a world where kids grow up knowing more about computers than their parents; where cell phones are the commonality rather than the exception, where we do indeed have more interaction with our computers than with real people most of the day, this futuristic movie brings it all home in a way which makes one say \\"I want to watch that again!\\"
B001GV09FS|5.0|This movie is just plain fun.  Everyone, including the guys, look like they had a blast making it.  Yeah, it's kind of a chick flick and the men are more or less the bimbos in the film, but when everyone has that much fun it's infectious.  Kick back and go with it, guys, who knows where it might take you, especially if you have a daughter.

B0015D3YQI|5.0|I saw this movie in 1986, and back then I didn't even know who Dario Argento was. I was fascinated by the plot, the music, and as a teenager, I developed a crush on Jennifer Connelly.<br /><br />More than twenty years later, the DVD comes out, and it is hard to believe that I had to wait this long, but hey, this DVD is worth every penny. You buy this, and you will stumble with two music videos, director's comments, and a movie you will never get tired of watching.
0920668372|5.0|I bought this book for my son to add to his library. He LOVES to read and this story has become a bedtime favorite! He's almost 2 years old and he often prompts me to say the line in the book, \\"I'll love you forever/I'll like you for always...\\" before tucking him in and before leaving for work in the mornings. I have bought this book for several friends for their baby showers and have gotten nothing but rave reviews from them. There are times when I can't get through the whole book without crying. The book really captures the love of a mother for her child. I HIGHLY recommend adding this to your collection!
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I am over sixty...........I enjoy movies a great deal, And with all the hype about this movie, I decided to see it. Well I have never expected to see such a contribed phoney piece of trash, as this is........  the kids that acted in this were the only saving grace, The story however was full of holes, And I suspect that in six months from now ..No one will even remember it......dont waste your time on this flick.......unless you need some sleep....be sure to bring your favorite pillow along as well
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Like the other seasons, lost is addicting.  Once I got started I could not quit.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  The best place to purchase and I received free shipping.
B001P9KR94|1.0|I'm sure this looks great on Blu-ray and all, but the movie is awful. Be an individual, think for yourself. These pity votes for horrible movies that portray lives which we as a judgmental and undiscerning public consider lesser than our own need to stop. Crash was a bad movie, this is a bad movie. These are bad films, don't watch them. Please. There is so much good cinema in this world. The new batman wowed everyone, and I found no one to be aw-struck by this film. Benjamin Button was great. There are so many good movies with credible reviews naming them as such. An award show can make a lot of money for a movie, but that doesn't mean it's good.
B000R8YC18|4.0|*Taxi Driver* is an excellent movie featuring superb acting by DeNiro, Foster, and Keitel.  The cinematography is fantastic in that its combination of lighting and location sets perfectly the mood.  The story is important in that it served as a warning when American society began changing drastically (i.e. nuclear familial breakdown) from the late 1960s - mid 1970s.  Its ultimate message is correct in its asessment of spiritual isolation's consequences (as well as the results of unjustified violence).    The movie, however, goes too far in its acceptance of youth exploitation.  Keitel's character, a child's pimp, is portrayed as somewhat caring and paternal.  As another reviewer noted, \\"he is not a monster.\\"  Such is dangerous acceptance (even if only intellectual for the movie's sake) of a vile practice which should never be tolerated under any circumstances.    Anyone who abuses children in any way (especially sexually, physically, or emotionally) for any reason (especially in a rational way for financial gain) is nothing short of a monster.  While vigilantism is also not acceptable, those who hurt children should be prosecuted to the fullest legal extent.  They should never be portrayed as anything other than what they are; selfish, abusive, and cowardly.    Foster's character portrayal has a serious flaw; while she is supposed to be 12 years old, she is actually depicted as an adult.  This film would have viewers think Foster's character is not really being abused or exploited, as she independantly decided to begin prostituting herself.  The film further implies that attempts to rescue her are in vain, as she has already lost her innocence and cannot return to a normal girl's life.    That characterization fails to consider an extremely important premise; 12 year-old children do not have the maturity, experience, or soundness of judgement to decide they want to be prostitutes. Such is the entire basis for all minimum age laws (be they sexual consent, alcohol purchase/consumption, driving, or voting related).  As children cannot rationally decide they want to be prostitutes, any adult who partakes of this activity in any way is an accomplice at the very least.    Furthermore, not all those who want to help child victims are deranged lunatics looking for an excuse to shoot people or use violence.  Helping the powerless is what being a good person is all about.  This movie would have people believe anyone who wants to protect the innocent or offer a helping hand has serious psychological problems.  How ridiculous!    Finally, giving up on lost children is not the reasonable answer.  While underage prostitutes will have obviously lost much innocence and will not be their pre-street selves if rescued, there is no excuse for allowing their continued abuse.  Coal miners trapped for extended periods after cave-ins often must live with serious mental problems if rescued.  Would it therefore make sense to argue they should not be rescued because they will not be their original happy selves?    While this is a great movie, please watch it with the understanding that child prostitution is inherently abusive and should never be condoned.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|Generic film with generic plot elements and horrible acting. Fight the power, don't watch this film. The Academy has made many, many big mistakes. Remember Pulp Fiction? Lost the Academy Award to Forrest Gump, stand up for movies of true quality and lasting appeal.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|With all the violence and sex of today, animation can bring out something entertaining without all the cursing. A lot of reviewers don't care for the way the world is left in ruin but its a story and it revolves around something we should all consider. To try to clean our earth up and preserve parks and sanctuaries for our future generations to enjoy.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|OK film. First time viewed. Don't need to see it again. More my wife's thing...
0743267478|5.0|I usually don't do this--dive for the book that inspired such a great movie. Usually some time must pass before I gradually lean toward checking out the original novel that inspires a good--and sometimes not-so-good-- movie.(Fortunately for me I read THE READER before seeing the film--and I am so glad I did. The movie became something entirely off the mark for me)<br /><br />But the film inspired from this novel just stole my heart, my soul, and like so many others, it stirred something deep in me and I had to get my hands on the book! There are some details that are not included in the film, but we totally understand why--there is so much that happens to Ram and the other characters that it's almost too much to bear.  And there's no gushy sentimentalism here. It's all so real and matter of fact, and Ram really is a soul looking to do the right things in what his life offers, despite such unbearable realities.<br /><br />I love the way each clue ties back to episodes from different periods in his life. It's about absorbing the strange lessons of life and here I didn't see the romance so much (the film goes to town with this aspect, and that's probably why it's so successful.), but the amazing life-story of Ram and his ability to move forward no matter the odds, is so compelling. This is not the most \\"literary\\" book out there, it is not a  WHITE TIGER ---actually, that book was dull and tedious next to this (the narrator just goes on and on in a crazy monologue that never evolves into a story).<br /><br />I rank this as one of the better reads, along with LIFE OF PI ( another story of beating amazing odds).

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is honestly one of the best movies I have seen. It is meant to entertain, and a lot of these negative reviewers are trying to break the movie down into something other than that.     Of course this movie has a fairy-tale feel, but when you get to know the main character (Jamal) through the movie, you will find yourself rooting for him towards the end.  There are very intense scenes in the movie, but I was very moved and thought it was a truly beautiful film.  This movie will turn out to be a classic.    P.S. If another movie like Benjamin Button was getting tons of accolades instead of this one, I am sure there would be backlash for it. It is a natural reaction for something so successful to get criticism.
1439102813|5.0|Fifty-year old Alice Howland has been a highly-regarded professor of psychology at Harvard for twenty five years and is a recognized authority in psycholinguistics.  She mentors graduate students, has co-authored a book, publishes scholarly papers, and travels all over the world to attend conferences and deliver lectures.  She and her and brilliant husband, John, who is a research biologist, are the parents of three grown children.  Alice and John are so busy with their professional lives that they hardly spend any time together.  Tragically, Alice's life is about to be upended and it will never return to normal again.<br /><br />In Lisa Genova's \\"Still Alice,\\" the protagonist senses that something is wrong when she starts losing and forgetting things for no apparent reason.  Alice is devastated when she is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's.  Although she sometimes thinks that she would rather be dead than demented, Alice bravely continues her struggle to stay afloat mentally and emotionally.  How ironic that this well-regarded expert on \\"the conceptual and neural organization of language\\" should find herself groping for the right words to describe everyday objects.  Over a two year period, Alice's world shrinks.  She changes from a busy and self-confident individual to a dependent and disoriented one.  As her mental state deteriorates, her family scrambles to cope with this heartrending tragedy.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" is a painful, eloquent, and all too realistic story about a strong-willed person who gradually loses her ability to communicate clearly and function independently.  For better or worse, Alice knows what is happening to her.  She thinks of her disease \\"as a demon in her head, tearing a reckless and illogical path of destruction,\\" and is \\"uneasy and painfully aware that she was declining, her past becoming unhinged from her present.\\"  Genova, who holds a doctorate in neuroscience, brings Alice's plight home with understanding and compassion.  Although Genova uses the third person to tell her story, she places us squarely in Alice's shoes.  We experience her fear, anger, grief, and despair as well as her family's anguish.  The author offers no pat solutions to Alice's woes, since there are none.  As Alice's neurologist tells her, \\"We can slow the rate of cognitive decline that you've been experiencing, but we can't stop it or reverse it.\\"  How sad it is when Alice says to her husband, \\"I can't stand the thought of looking at you someday, this face I love, and not knowing who you are.\\"es the third person to tell her story, she places us squarely in Alice's shoes.

0393316041|5.0|What I perceive of Richard Feynman is a man who exudes a great level of confidence. His confidence helped him to question things, helped him to work hard at achieving success at difficulties he encountered and that confidence permeated his everyday experiences both socially and academically. Whenever he was truly unimpressed by something, he does not mince his words to correct for the emotion or feelings of the ones he was opposed to ultimately.    What may have been his greatest undoing or flaw is the fact that he NEVER really listens. Subtly, through the text, you can sense his quick undermining statements--not utterly condescending though. To the reader, this might be wrong, but to Feynman, it was his way of making elaborate constructions of the complacence of others and by so doing, was necessarily placing everyone on the same level field of intelligence.    \\"Ofey\\" (his name as an artist) remained a student of life and he had enriching experiences, even with the ladies--beautiful ones too. A word for even the relegated geeks or unsociable nerds- if a physics nobel laureate can do it, then who shouldn't?    Finally, because of Feynman, I know everyone can write a story. If you have not really been a big fan of physics, pick up a book on physics again, and you will be surprised at how you approach it now. You can read and understand it, because PHYSICS works.     Very enjoyable read. It is such a pity that he is gone now from us. I would have personally loved to meet him.

A few months ago he took the state reading test and his score showed him reading at a 7th grade level, and he is only a 5th grader. I'm glad books like these are written to grab the interest and imagination of kids, I know it's been a very positive impact on my son, I hope the author keeps writing them.
141690977X|1.0|If you don't pretty much understand this book when you read the title... there is something wrong.  I suppose this book is a smack to the head for those who need it.  Silly me... I thought it was obvious when a guy didn't call that he wasn't interested.      Ladies - have some pride in yourself... get to know your soul, then find a mate... stop searching for a soulmate.  Whatever that is.     I don't understand the big deal about this book.  Letters from mostly sad lonely women.  I get it... dating sucks... but there is no excuse for the desperation required to need this as a self help book.
141690977X|5.0|I read this book in one day, I just couldn't put it down.  I had recently gone through a break up and I could relate to a lot of the letters written in the book.  I absolutely love Greg's scarcasm and sense of humor.  I cracked up out loud reading this book.  I went and saw the Movie and was equally entertained.  I can't wait to read the sequal!
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. This review is for the Blu ray quality only. I am not offering reviews for the movie. If the movie was not more than 3 stars in my opinion I would not have purchased the Blu Ray.I already have the 3 titles in standard DVD. Could be just my imaginatioin but I think the video quality on the Identity and Supremacy is superior to the Ultimatum in this Blu Ray set. This could be because the Ultimatun on the standard  disc was already of high quality so I do not see an appreciable difference in the Blu Ray.<br />The Bourne Triology Blu Ray is far far superior to the Godfather Trilogy in Blu Ray. The Bourne Blu Ray trilogy is a good buy and a must have for all Blu Ray 1080p nuts.<br />SinCT Mu T<br /><br />Note to Editor - Do not publish my real name. Use only SinCT Mu T. Tks
B000IOM0WO|4.0|This movie is more than knowledge by the fans. The quality is excellent.<br />But...<br />For a BD I was expecting a better image quality than a DVD. It was made with 1080p but the video looks like the DVD I have, just a little bit better. Looks like a copy of DVD in a Blue Ray format.<br />But Im not a technician, maybe there is a reason for that.<br />Anyway, I was expecting a image quality like others recent movies in BD.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Season 1 of Desperate Housewives is the show at its peak, having the perfect mix of drama, humor, and mystery. It has a darker edge and much sharper humor than subsequent seasons. It also benefits from the amazingly talented actor, Steven Culp who plays the 'one minute you hate him, next minute you love him' Rex Van de Camp, an awesome match for Marcia Cross (Bree Van de Camp). I must admit that I'd rather watch the DH Season 1 DVD's than the current season on TV.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is wonderful, and is really for those who saw the episodes.  I was completely satisfied with it after having seen all the TV episodes.

B00006AW2G|1.0|The DSD Copyright protection scheme means no play on the computer, so no adding to ITunes Playlist.  These ABCKO people must still be high from the 60's. My disc was also defective on the standard CD player, jumping and skipping ( in a copyright protected digitally re-mastered sort of way) This version of the ROLLING STONES LET IT BLEED disc SUXIT.

B0012IWHUU|5.0|Typical modern Dropkick Murphys sound and songs, that just grow on you so well the more you listen.  Some real standouts that become instant classics such as State of Massachusetts, Echoes on \\"A\\" Street, and of course Flannigans Ball.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Pink is a talented songwriter and vocalist. This release does not disappoint. She is clearly moving on after breaking up with her motocross husband and her songs clearly give him the finger. If you like Pink, this is once again a great showcase for a very talented musician.
031606792X|5.0|I loved the final saga in this series even though it got a little bit too sappy in places throughout the book. I am glad for the happy ending but it could have had a little more real vampire action to it. It was way too fairytaleish. Nothing was typical vampire behavior except for their incredible strength which never did anything except take down a bear,lion or deer and always had the restraint when it came to humans. Why couldn't Bella's newborn behavior have been a little rougher at first and then calmed as she became a more mature vampire? She could have had a little less restraint which may have been a little more realistic to what vampire behavior is depicted. The Volturi backed down way to easy, there should have been a little more drama to that scene also.    Couldn't there have been a little better name for Renessme/Nessie? Carlie would have been the better choice for Carlisle and Charlie. She had good names for everyone else.     With this being said, I loved the books overall. I still could not put these books down for a second.  I read all four within about five days. They are really good books and I can't wait for the movie, \\"New Moon\\" to be released in November.
B00008WJBU|3.0|This Spanish film is a strange one, a hard one to follow story-wise, but visually striking and interesting most of the way.     The story involves people with th ability to steal \\"luck\\" from other people and then taking it away from fellow takers. Make sense? Hmmm......that's for you to decide.  I will say it's an intriguing film.    The DVD transfer is sharp and has good sound.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an astonishing series.  It is something I will watch over and over.  I know I will learn something new each time.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|For a long time, this was the only one of the Indiana Jones films I did not like. Because it came as part of the package that introduced it to DVD over five years ago, I had to buy it if I wanted the other two, so I gave it a another look. Wow, all of sudden I liked it.    For the first time, the woman (Kate Capshaw) and the young boy (Ke Huy Quan) weren't as annoying as I had remembered them. The  kid really had rubbed me the wrong way, but this time only Kate was annoying....and she was fine once she calmed down and got rid of the hysterics.    The action in this film is mostly at the beginning and at the end. It is so Rambo-ish (bad guys never hit the target but good guys always do) it is ludicrous. It also has dumb dialog in a number of spots, paying homage to voodooism, spells and other nonsense.    Yet, despite these criticisms, it's entertaining start-to-finish and has some fantastic visuals. The photography in here is beautiful: the best of the Indiana Jones adventures. I particularly liked the opening dance number which reminded me of a Busby Berkeley extravaganza.     This whole film looks spectacular on DVD and I'm interested to see what it will look like on Blu-Ray.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Knights of Cydonia is the far best track. Makes me want to join a cover band!!
B00006IUL7|4.0|Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitors    Robin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example. He's especially good at creepy nut-cases (See \\"One Hour Photo\\") Williams doesn't enter the movie until about halfway through and he's fascinating in a low-key role (until the end).    For a modern-day crime film, this doesn't have a lot of action but that's fine if the acting is this good and the story involving. Here, the acting is better than the story. Kudos to Hillary Swank, too, for her performance as the cop.    The Alaskan scenery ain't bad, either.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Excellent Album. Heard them on the radio, but never an artist announcement. Some digging found that it was Muse. Best on album- Plug in Baby. Killer guitar!!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This DVD is a blast.  I wish there were more episodes or that it was much longer.  It is obviously done in a rather tongue in cheek manner, but it's very entertaining.
B001TOD92C|5.0|The Wrestler marks Darren Aronofsky's growth as a film-maker from strange, science-fiction tinged films to films with emotional resonance in a real setting. I am a huge Aronofsky fan, loving Requiem for a Dream nearly as much as Pi, but I was underwhelmed by his last effort, The Fountain. His films are almost unbearably intense, most prominently shown in Requiem, but The Fountain abandoned his first two films' grittiness for a sleeker, polished story-line, exploring ambitious philosophical themes while failing to deliver on the emotional level. For a while, I was worried where Aronofsky's career would go, especially after seeing that he was helming a project called The Wrestler, which seemed to deviate from the subjects of his previous works.    The Wrestler gets everything right. Aronofsky trades high-minded philosophical themes for a more grounded, concrete narrative. He also reestablishes the inventive camera-work that made Pi and Requiem so aesthetically stunning, shooting almost the entire film on a hand-held camera. And, lastly and most refreshingly, he reinstates the violence and shock-value of his first films, escalating the wrestling scenes to cringe-inducing bouts of brutality and decadence. However, such violence is in aid of characterization--to show the hearts behind these men in the ring, to demonstrate the toll such entertainment may take on one's body, all in the service of a loyal, loving audience.    \\"The only place I get hurt is out there,\\" says \\"The Ram\\" as he enters the ring towards the end of the film. Rourke, giving a breathtaking performance that should have EASILY triumphed at the Oscars (it's a travesty that he didn't win), provides us a window into the tortured soul of a man who's thrown his life away for the sake of his profession. No matter how much Ram deviates from our idealized vision of a hero, the audience never feels any animosity towards him; he screwed up, and he knows it, but he can't help it.    The mirrors to Rourke's life areeasily seen, making the film into some manner of Greek tragedy rather than mere drama. It is Aronofsky's presence, and a wonderfully crafted script, that sets The Wrestler above other comback portraits like Rocky; the brutality is reminiscent of Raging Bull, and the style behind the film is a marvel in itself. The Ram is equated to Christian iconography, pointed out by Marisa Tomei's stripper, in that he suffers for humanity--not only is it an effective comparison, but it gives the film more depth than the average comeback piece. The buildup of sounds is used frequently as well, to great effect, to further the window in the life of the Ram.    The film is not for everyone; my sister refused to watch the wrestling scenes, because they are quite shocking. Some scenes are rather melodramatic, but effectively so, making the film a draining emotional experience (I went teary-eyed at least twice). But, it is a rewarding film if you have any interest in the craft, or wish to see the performance of a lifetime by Mickey Rourke.
B001P5HI4A|4.0|We waited quite a while for this one to come out on DVD and now it's finally here.  A really good Barbara Streisand movie - we really enjoyed it and are happy to have it as part of our movie library.

B001JFNBJC|5.0|I received The Twilight by Original Soundtrack CD in great condition and it was shipped quickly.  I am very pleased w/ the product.  The music makes the movie come to life when we listen to it! It is a great soundtrack.  As with all things Twilight it really is great! I love the music and have even looked in to some of the bands that are featured on the cd. I would by another CD from Amazon from the same seller.  I highly recommend Amazon and this seller.  This CD is a must for any Twilight fan on your list or for yourself.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|If your a tried and true star wars fan, this movie is for you. I think it fits between episodes two and three and does a pretty good job of filing that gap. Also a must have if you enjoy the animated Clone Wars TV series.

B000P2A24W|5.0|WOW.  A friend had this CD and the variety of songs on it blew me away.  And THEN she told me it was Bon Jovi -- and friends ... I was stunned.  A little bit of country, a little bit of rock 'n roll, a little bit of blues ... this album has it all.  I LOVE it and highly recommend it -- you don't need to be a Bon Jovi fan to enjoy this album; you only need to enjoy different genres of popular music.  I promise you'll like it!
B001KYJA6K|5.0|...but if you love for your early music in general and Monteverdi in particular to be full of dramatic and musical relevance, you'll definitely want this new release from Pluhar's L'Arpegiatta.  They'll be few instances in which the immediacy of the music and richness of the text will seem more vigorous or well matched.  There's something absolutely infectious about the performances, not to mention something that would seem almost impossible in 400 year old music, and that is a type of freshness that almost verges on the novel, but never so much that it distorts or cheapens the innate beauty of Monteverdi's art.  It's playful yet mature, beautiful without being garish.  Those who prefer their early music on the more academic and, dare I say, staid side, will no doubt object to liberties Pluhar has taken but those open to new ideas and innovative touches, will eat this recording up.  Suffice it to say that I strongly recommend it.
B0000258CK|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" this \\"album\\" in the late 90s.  What can I say, I was young when it first came out.  Since that fateful day in Borders, I was hooked and still am.  Unfortunately, I have had to replace it twice.  Both times because someone took my copy.  There should be a law against such things.  Anyway, this album has always been worth replacing.  Ms. King was such a song writer who knew she could sing?  Well we all know better don't we?  If I had to pick an album that I would take with me on a deserted island it would definately be Tapestry.  Hopefully, I would be allowed a CD player otherwise it would be frustrating to have a great album and no where to play it.
0783226888|3.0|Is it wrong that I was rooting for the assassin the entire film? I mean I love a great shoot-em-up flick now and again, but what I found when watching \\"The Jackal\\" was that I was really hoping to see Willis pull of his assignment.<br /><br />I'm not into spoilers, so I won't say whether or not the titular assassin is successful in eliminating his target, but the fun of the film lies in seeing him plot his crime. Richard Gere as a former IRA \\"terrorist\\" is okay as the lead, but gets overshadowed both by Willis and by his Soviet MVD counterpart. The Irish accent Gere adopts in the flick isn't as bad as Kevin Costner's \\"Robin Hood\\" English accent, but it is pretty close. I think there were several problems with the film, not the least of which is its being compared with the stellar original. Also, while watching the Jackal prepare for his job, you have to think to yourself \\"Is that really the best option available?\\" You would think a seasoned professional hitman would come up with something a little less complicated, and a little more efficient? Oh well, at least we get to see Jack Black suffer for a little while.<br /><br />If you are into political thrillers, you may or may not like this. It really depends on your ability to suspend disbelief while watching. If you are into to shoot-em-up thrillers, you probably won't care for this often \\"talky\\" thriller. When the action does occur, it's done well, but for the most part the film is centered around planning, plotting and dialogue.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flick, no it's not going to become a replayable favorite, but it is fun. The performances are all decent, and while the storyline isn't watertight, it's passable. If nothing else, it might be worth popping onto your Netflix account.

B00004DTLJ|3.0|I was finally able to replace my worn out cassette tape of \\"Innocence is no Excuse\\". Why is this album so tough to find on CD? Thankfully, I saw a used CD copy listed here on Amazon at a reasonable price and picked it up.<br /><br />After listening to \\"Innocence\\" again, I have to say I appreciate the album much more than I did 20 years ago upon it's initial release. While it may not be my favorite Saxon album, as a fan I had to have a copy to complete my Saxon CD library.<br /><br />There are some great tunes here:<br /><br />\\"Broken Heroes\\" - A cool anti-war tune with a memorable chorus that will ring through your head after one listen.<br /><br />\\"Everybody Up\\" - Another great hair-metal anthem from a band the laid down the blueprint for hair-metal anthems. I would love to have seen these guys perform this live.<br /><br />\\"Give it Everything You've Got\\" - Nigel Glockler's drum work on this tune is phenomenal. The driving drums carry the tune to whole new level, and represent why Glockler is one of the premiere drummers of the 80's metal scene.<br /><br />I know many fans felt Saxon had \\"sold out\\" and tried to go for a more \\"glam\\" sound with this album. I disagree. Sure, the tunes were radio friendly for the most part, and I'm sure they were striving for success in America with tunes like \\"Rock n' Roll Gypsy\\" or \\"Call of the Wild\\". But the Saxon sound you know and love is still present on these cuts, and \\"Innocence\\" captures the band in their prime. If you are a fan of the band, you owe it to yourself to pick up this disk. (but good luck finding it!!)

0451196716|3.0|I love Steven King! But--this novel was too dark, and it had a plot problem. I could not accept the idea of parents allowing their teenagers to be in a race in which failure meant death (soldiers shooting the kids that slowed down--shooting them in front of watching crowds!).<br /><br />If you make things too inhuman, you go so far over the top that the reader has a hard time accepting the premise.  This novel is heavy with the metaphor that we are all born in a race and get picked off one by one. This view of life just does not appeal to me.<br /><br />MAKING KING'S NOVEL BETTER: Okay, the boys join the long walk, and when someone slows down, they are picked up by a white van and taken away. Everyone believes they are being treated well. But the hero discovers a dark truth. He runs off the side of the road to take a leak, and he sees a white van. He sneaks up and looks in the windows. Inside, a doctor is removing the heart of one of the runners. Thus, the boys are all being killed for their organs--including their families who just up and disappear because of this evil organization. At the end, the boys rebel and attack the white van. They kill the bad guys, and the evil organization is revealed and destroyed.<br /><br />Wouldn't that be more satisfying? As it is...I won't tell the ending, but it is not satisfying. In the \\"Stand,\\" billions of people die off, and a few good guys re-establish civilization. In the \\"Tommyknockers,\\" the bad aliens get their just reward.<br /><br />That's what the readers of horror novels want--a scary escape that ends on a hopeful note. We read books about horrible things that turn out good (even if a lot of good people get killed). We don't always need a happy ending, but at least a satisfying ending.<br /><br />King's essay at the beginning of the book on the \\"Importance of Being Richard Backman\\" was interesting, but weird. Oh, well, like I said, I love Steven King's novels, but this one didn't work for me--too much of the same thing.<br /><br />Read my review of Steven King's \\"Colorado Kid,\\" which I think had a similar flaw.<br />[[ASIN:0843955848 The Colorado Kid (Hard Case Crime)]]olorado Kid,\\" which I think had a similar flaw.

B001P9KR94|5.0|Because if he had I don't think he would have been so negative. Granted both The Dark Knight and Wall-E were shamefully absent from the Oscar list but that does not mean that Slumdog should be accountable. It is a very fast moving, emotional, and excellent film. if you haven't seen it you must. I know for a fact that everyone I know (and I don't personally know ANY film critics) LOVED this movie.
B00006JKOM|4.0|1976 saw the breaking of punk rock and disco music ushered into our lives.  Being a Jethro Tull fan wasn't fashionable...and the lame \\"cartoony\\" cover art of Tull's latest certainly didn't help this record.  But this album ranks up there with \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\".  As always, great guitar work and tone by Martin Barre.  Ian Anderson has some really nice songs on here.  \\"Taxi Grab\\" being a highlight for myself.  \\"Quizz Kid\\" and \\"Crazed Institution\\" are good rockers.<br />I had this album when it first came out.  I saw it was remastered and recently picked it up used, thinking (even if I  just listen to it once or twice) it'll be worth it.  It stayed in my car stereo for two weeks.  It took me back and made me appreciate this album more than when I was a teen.  The remastering really helped a lot of frequencies find their way into my old hairy ears!
B001H5X7JS|5.0|I loved this movie.  Robert Downey Jr. steals the show, but, after watching it 30 or 40 times, the character Kevin Sandusky really shines.  Buy this movie!
B000068OCS|1.0|This is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. It is a cold, hostile look at our planet through the eyes of someone who clearly hates people and the effect we have had on Earth. All of the images are \\"big-picture\\" so that even at the beginning, where the scenes are all nature in its vast, bleak, raw glory, there is not a hint of life. At first I wondered if I was watching footage of an exploration of Mars, but as the film progressed, I began to recognize many of our National Parks, shot in the most unflattering light. I have been to some of the places in this film, but what I experienced there made me love nature even more. This film, on the other hand, gave me the opposite feeling of David Attenborough's work. If I were an alien visiting this planet and I experienced it the way this film does, I would want to blow it up along with all of the hostile nature forms and colonies of busy ant-like people on it. Films like this encourage anti-social and environmental activists and discourage nature lovers. Do yourself a favor and skip this one in favor of Planet Earth or another film which focuses on the beauty of our planet and leaves you feeling like there's something here worth saving.

0316066524|5.0|I wasn't compelled to write a review until I read some of the others.  It's interesting that those who didn't like the book frequently try to couch this in some sort of greater issue, like it's a case of \\"The Emperor has no Clothes\\", or whatever.    This book is what it is.  I loved it.  I have no agenda, and I'm not looking to appear smart.  For cross reference purposes, Pynchon's \\"Mason & Dixon\\" is one of my favorite books ever, but I couldn't get through that same author's \\"Against the Day\\".    This book is complex and multi-layered.  Many have complained about the lack of resolution.  The resolution is there, you just have to look for it (and admittedly, if Wallace's writing style isn't your cup of tea, that could be excruciating).  Clues to the fate of Hal Incandenza are littered throughout the book.  It could take a lifetime to find them all, but they are there.  Do a google search on the subject and you'll find all sorts of great discussions.    For my part, I know I'll continue to re-read this book, getting more insight each time, and this will be in no way unpleasurable.
B000001FKY|1.0|If you like over produced, slick MTV hair metalpop with band members who have strategically placed tears in their jeans this is for you.  Me?  I'll listen to Jane's Addiction's \\"Nothing Shocking\\" instead.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I know it's been said a million times already and I hate to sound clich&eacute;, but it's a statement that rings true every time you say it. Who would have thought Danny Boyle, a man from Manchester could have created such an award winning phenomenon. Slumdog Millionaire is a film I tried to keep away from as long as possible as I didn't want to seem like a person who jumps on the bandwagon. I guess it was inevitable that I was to see it eventually and tonight was the night. It has remained in my memory for a few hours so far and that lump in my throat has yet to subside. From start to finish I was completely engrossed and I have decided that those saying negative things about this picture are ones trying a bit too hard to steer clear of that dreaded wagon.<br /><br />So the story itself is based around 3 main characters, 4 if you count the \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\\" host. Jamal the main character starts off in a police station as he is accused of cheating to win the \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\\" big 20 Rupees prize. Determined to prove his innocence to the Police, he starts telling them the stories of situations in his life which taught him the answers to the questions which he has inadvertently remembered for all that time. What we get to see as the game show progresses are a number of different defining events in Jamals childhood that are in one way heart breaking and in another heart warming.<br /><br />He and his brother Salim remained very close to one another from birth and stuck together after their mother was killed. One night after the murder of their mother, they were sleeping in a container as protection from the rain and they met a girl named Latika. Jamal took this companionship from one of his favourite books and labelled them the Three Musketeers, although they could never remember the name of the third after Athos and Porthos. Salim's relationship is never too favourable towards Latika until they get older and after being split up at the still very early age, they meet up many years later and events get worse and worse with Salim raping Latika.<br /><br />There are other events that take place which I will not spoil for the sake of your enjoyment, so I will now comment on the other amazing parts of the film. The acting was superb throughout and brought some genuinely surprising choices and showed us what they were capable of. Of course the young and teenage versions of Salim, Jamal and Latika were superb but unfortunately attracted accusations of these Indian child actors being taken advantage of. Whether they were or not doesn't take anything away from their fantastic performances. The adult versions of the three characters are played by the fantastically surprising Dev Patel (Jamal), Freida Pinto (Latika) and Madhur Mittal (Salim). Each delivered an astonishing performance, especially from the wonderful Dev Patel known originally to myself as Anwar from Skins in the UK.<br /><br />The film was set mostly on location which allowed for the true tragedy of the Mumbai slums to be captured in all their glory. There have been things I've read that accuse Danny Boyle's picture of being demonising of the life in the slums. I don't know how you can demonise actual conditions being shown as they are, if anything I believe this is more complementary of the life in the slums. Although you could imagine it to be a very poor and dirty area, the slums are shot in a way that looks very artistic and in some senses quite beautiful. The soundtrack complements this immensely and I think without such spectacular music behind it, I think I would have had a whole different perspective on the film.<br /><br />To those steering clear of the film because of its massive award success, I have only one thing to say. You're idiots, the lot of you. This is a beautifully artistic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all film fans alike. I could talk for hours about the psychological implications of the life suffered by the children in this picture, but I have chosen not too. It's a brilliant film that I know as long as you give it a chance, you will love it.. It's a brilliant film that I know as long as you give it a chance, you will love it.

B00005LC1H|2.0|Being a Python fan and a fan of some other British comedies (Good Neighbors, Are You Being Served), I was very pleased to find this complete DVD set at a used store that I shop at. Once I got it home and started watching, however, it was very clear that this type of comedy was made for people with certain tolerances. Fawlty Towers fans, I expect to get flamed for this, so flame away. The criticism I will try to make is going to be based on logic, not rants.     First, the main character, Basil Fawlty, played by Cleese. Basil was modeled after an experience Cleese and the other Pythons had with an extremeely foul-tempered hotel owner while on holiday. Basil is brash, rude, inconsiderate, and generally painful to watch. He is a complete and utter wanker to his guests unless they are of some high social standing. Once in a while, we see Basil get his comeuppance from an overly irritated guest, or something of the like, and that's actually enjoyable, as he usually gets thumped pretty severely. Every person at one time or another has wanted to do that to someone as utterly nasty as Basil.   Comedian Richard Briers said in his interview on the 'Good Neighbors' series that to be a comedy actor you had to exude a certain amount of vulnerability so that the the audience would care about you. Cleese's character of Basil evokes no sympathy or empathy whatsoever, as you find it impossible to relate to a man who is so deliberately narcissistic, sarcastic, and rude to his guests. Perhaps this is why John Cleese hates Britain so much, for those few individuals who are so class-conscious that they constantly trod on other people.    Secondly, the cast. There does not seem to be any chemistry between most of the leading actors, and most of the acting seems forced, not to mention the gags. The only saving grace is Manuel the waiter, played by Andrew Sachs. There is a lot of byplay involving his difficulty communicating with the customers (and Basil) because of his difficulty learningthe language.    This series was one that I really wanted to like, and it fell very short .It's a shame they only made four seasons of Good Neighbors, as it was a fine Britcom. Perhaps I'll try 'Yes, Minister' next.

B00127RAJY|5.0|The Shred is a great workout DVD.  I have only done level 1 so far but in 20 minutes, I really felt like I was doing \\"something\\".  Jillian uses large muscles and small muscles at the same time to burn more calories.  I have no doubt that if I did this for 30 days straight, it would transform my body. I am in relatively good shape and level one was almost challenging.  I was sweating like crazy, but felt like I needed more cardio afterwards, so I did 45 mins on the elliptical.  However, I think for people just starting out, or those very overweight, level one would be very challenging.  Jillian is not \\"mean\\" on here like she is on the show.  She shows modifications for most of the exercises in case you need it.  I highly recommend this.

A real and lasting piece of musical art. Many generations from now people will still be discovering this album and getting the Beatle message loud and clear--even if it's a solo album this fantastic.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I like many Will Smith movies.  He doesn't let you down in this movie.  Excellent movie.
B000I0RNV6|4.0|This film is truly a standout in story telling and fluidity.  It's adorable young star radiates curiosity and mischief in positive ways.  The story line is simple, but it unfolds with enough complexity to keep you interested right up to the end.  Even if you're not interested in Italian culture or language, just turn on the subtitles and enjoy.  There's plenty for guys and gals both.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|this is the most brutal band in the land the best cd from them yet
0786948523|5.0|There are two different ways to look up monsters: alphabetically and by level. It does include a guide to reading the monster information which was helpful. When looking up monsters in either way, the only thing I feel it is missing is how much XP the monster awards. I found it a little annoying having to look up a monster, turning to that page and then finding the amount of XP wasn't as much as I wanted to award or was too much to award. I also think it would have been beneficial if they could have included a section that organizes monsters by environment.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This series consisted almost entirely of two-person dialogues that I found very compelling, particularly the insights Gabriel Byrne's psychologist character would uncover. Equally compelling were his confronting his own failings as a husband and father in his treatment sessions with a psychologist played by Dianne Wiest. Glynn Turman has one scene in this series that may contain the finest acting I've seen in a long, long time. Why isn't he getting bigger roles?
B000000YBQ|5.0|This is the second production from the venerable Sunday Vanguard sessions. While both recordings are recommended, I give a slight preference to this set. The intimate interplay between bassist Scott LaFaro and pianist Bill Evans is more dynamic, ranging from soft exchange to an intense crescendo of dialogue.  There is hardly an equal in jazz to the relation between the skill and sensitivity of these two players, and it is one that recalls the pairing of Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond on their most exciting performances.  Highly recommended.
630460291X|5.0|This is the very first Kevin Costner movie I ever watched and I became an instant fan.  This is my all time favorite movie.  When society switched from VHS to CD's for movie entertainment, I went and bought this movie to keep in my collection.  I am a huge Kevin Costner fan.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|We are on our 4th swivel sweeper. It goes in places our vacuum can't get to. It's light. We use it daily.Our regular vacuum once a week. It's ease of use is impressive. The downside. The batteries don't hold up as long as we would like. The plastic gears wear out requireing we buy a new sweeper every now and then. The one we have now purchased thru Amazon is a second. The Batteriy on the handle is not in the right place making it harder to use. Also some of the brushes are missing. However the overall ease of use makes it a further buy.

B001O2ZW1A|5.0|Steven Wilson may just be the industry's best kept secret. Despite a multicontextual and multidirectional career which has delved into almost every genre imaginable, even Wilson's most popular of projects remain far-removed from the mainstream. He began his professional career with No-Man, in the sad vein of dreamy synth-pop, and has since gone on to form progressive groundbreaker Porcupine Tree, the dark and always irresistably catchy Blackfield, the psychedelic improv-based I.E.M., and worked with standard-setting bands such as Opeth and King Crimson. While anyone familiar with the above bands knows of Wilson's studio wizardry and multi-instrument proficiency, a solo career under his own name has been limited to a series of CD-R releases of acoustic material and cover songs only available through his web site and some random electronic instrumentals which remain largely obscure. Not anymore.    Insurgentes is his full-length debut, under his own name, and hits the listener as effectively as a well-aimed audio shotgun blast. It delves into every genre Wilson has explored while at the same time expanding on each of them, all the while attaining it's own unique sound with the focus and precision of a laser beam. This is a skill beyond the average musician, leaving the listener to always expect the unexpected. Indeed, the stylistic changes are often within the context of a single track, as Wilson begins \\"Salvaging\\" with a simple yet sinister guitar riff complemented by his snarls of \\"what was the point of making me trust...yeah you make me feel sick...\\" before dropping out the bottom into a soaring orchestral arrangement worthy of J. Ralph's approval. \\"Get All That You Deserve\\" works in the opposite direction as Wilson enters eerily, accompanied by only a piano, before bringing in massive walls of noisy distortion like angry drunks crashing a funeral. He has proven himself a true musical Dr. Frankenstein in his ability to take something beautiful and destroy it, onlyto resurrect it to even greater heights than before.    Consistency is still an ingredient throughout this madhouse of sonic manipulation, as \\"Harmony Korine\\" immediately lends itself to the status of hit single and the nostalgic \\"Veneno Para Las Hadas\\" evokes fond memories of Porcupine Tree's \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" with heart-wrenching beauty. Be wary of this album: it will immediately set the bar higher than anything you've heard this year or even this decade and leave the mark of true musical genius on your auditory lobes by comparatively ruining every other album you hear afterwards.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|First off, I will just say that my only qualm about this picture was its length.  In the past, a certain pedigree has been expected of Bond films' runtimes; they are LOOONG.  This is typically not a bad thing, if done right, and the film doesn't drag on.  However this flick clocks in about 45 minutes less than Royale, and I thought it could have used just a little more substanence.       That said, grain of salt and all that, this was a very good movie.  I stood up at the end and escorted my girl out of the theatre with me and said \\"Wow, that was a great movie.\\"  In the end that is all you can ask for.  For those on here looking for an unbiased view, or one not laced with peoples' hatreds and indolences, this is where you should look.  They burned the poor man at the stake in '05 when he was announced as Bond, they continued to bust his chops after Royale, (which was both a commercial and critical success by the way) and they continue to stone him after this effort.  And it is just wrong.  'Bond Purists' 'Old Timers' and all of their ilk share in their own naiveity. They stamp their feet begging and whining for Connery back, and lash out at anything else, reguardless of how evidently well the movie/actor has done.       The fact of the matter is, Daniel Craig, under the production of the current crew has brilliantly opened up a new avenue of 007 that people have never been introduced to, or seen in the near 50 years since Fleming wrote Casino Royale.  His performance adds such great contrast and depth to a man we all thought we knew absolutely everything about after 20 films, but yet he manages to bring something very new to the stale cookie-cutter James Bond portrayed over the last 40 years.  Not that these are bad performances... just stale.  Hell, I own every Bond film.     This is a great film, and definitly worth a watch if you into James Bond, the spy genre, action or all of the above.  I would recommend watching Casino Royale before this if you have not seen it yet, as this movie is a continuation of that picture, which further separates QoS and Royale from every other Bond film.  Never before has continuity ever been fully utilized in the 007 universe, and they do it well here.    As I said before, don't look to the bad-teeth feet-stampers crying for a Connery/Moore clone to come back.  Watch this film, and judge for yourself.
B000XA5K48|1.0|This movie could have been awarded for the \\"worst of 2008\\"....it was just about as bad as you can get!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000F8O2OM|5.0|The product lives up to what it said.  If you like Star Gate SG 1 you will enjoy this season as well.
0767802624|5.0|Tommie Lee Jones and Will Smith in the same movie, what more needs to be said!
031606792X|5.0|I loved the whole series.  I really hope there are more books to come because she leaves you wanting to know more about the rest of the characters.  Like what happens to all the families that stood up with them.  I also want to know what happens with Jacob and Renesmee.  She definitely leaves you wanting more and more....
B000FS9MV0|5.0|It's always a pleasure shopping Amazon for any of my product needs.  I remain a repeat customer!

B001NFNFNU|5.0|The is the first movie I've seen in a long time that starred Angelina Jolie where she wasn't playing Angelina Jolie. Talk about cakewalk in her past movies--say a few lines, give us that cute little smug smirk, and watch the money roll in! OK, I did enjoy her in her action flicks of recent years, but finally she's able to show us all in Changeling that she can act with the best of 'em!    Clint E. does a great job of giving off that old-time vibe with the setting in the 20's. The movie doesn't have a really happy ending, but then again, it's a true story, and most true stories do not end in utopia. Nowadays, you're lucky if the guilty is found guilty. So overall, a satisfying enough ending.    I gotta say, though, those 20's outfits on women were TERRIBLE! They don't show any shape at all--BORING! :)
B00005JPCF|5.0|Shipping was fast - DVD was in perfect shape!  Completely satisfied with the seller and the experience!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing this workout for 3 weeks now and have not been able to get beyond Level - 1 !I have already lost 5 pounds. I also did 2 hours of Zumba the other day, and Jillian still shreds!
B00110K62U|5.0|Well executed, well performed, well done!  I put on the DVD and let it fill my background while I am working.  I do find myself distracted by it and end up just sitting and watching!
B00000DI06|5.0|This is an excellent CD. I had an ulterior motive for ordering it, however. I sing in a local Choral Society and we are performing it this coming weekend. I wanted the CD to follow along at home and get my part down a little better. I do very much enjoy John Rutter's music and the Cambridge Singers are very good.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|I first saw Tess... on OETA and was hooked, so I immediately went the the Internet to buy it.  The movie is long but so worth seeing.  It is a very moving film full of happy and sad moments.  To be honest, I cried several times during this movie.  I would not consider this a \\"chick flick\\" as men in my family also really liked it.  The actors did a quality job.  I found Amazon to have the cheapest price and they shipped it very quickly.
B000FC2L1Y|3.0|I enjoyed the Outlander series, and read the first three books in about two weeks.  This fourth book is an unnecessary continuation of the series.  For lovers of Claire and Jamie's story, it would have been best to end the series after Book 3.      The newly evolving characters don't make a lot of sense, and seemed to move between centuries so easily, adapting without any trouble at all. The storyline didn't seem historical, and seemed like a modern story happening in the 18th century.      I kept hoping it would improve towards the end, but I was disappointed. I'll keep my memories of the move to America as the start of a new life for Jamie and Claire, and read no more of this series.
1599869330|5.0|Of late, I have noticed an epidemic of misplaced apostrophes.  I've seen them in emails, advertisements, just...everywhere.  For example, I received an email from someone yesterday who wanted me to know of his availability on \\"Wednesday's.\\"  Wednesday doesn't own anything.  The man's sentence made no sense!  This kind of thing drives me crazy, especially when it comes from someone who clearly should know better.<br /><br />Look, I'm anal about grammar.  I should be - I make my living by the written word.  I'm no grammatical saint either.  I make my share of mistakes.  That's why we (collectively, writers everywhere) have this book.  I think it should be required reading in high school or college.  There are so many educated people who have a hard time forming a proper sentence, and this need not be the case.<br /><br />This book is a great resource, as many have noted.  I think everyone should have a copy, especially those who need to work on their punctuation or some other aspect of their writing.  I include myself in this category.
B00005OAIE|3.0|The CD is good in general, I enjoyed only two songs out of the entire Disc. I recommend it if you like soft music slow paced.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I loved watching this show and I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I can neither quit watching this show nor can wait till the season 2 comes out.  The first two episodes in the season 1 are rather on a sleeper side, however, once Leonard suddenly becomes a \\"magnificent beast\\" and Howard, with his meager luck, briefly cohabits with a hoer from the Babylon (both episodes involving their real sleeping), you can no longer stop watching the show.  I watched each season 1 episode at least 4 times.  Ranking the season 1 episodes was easy at first but the order kept changing somewhat upon every round of my viewership.  According to my self-centered verdict, the Physics Ball episode was the funniest sitcom that I'd seen in a long time.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Thanks! I real love that movie. I hear Supernatural 4 season coming. I can't wait see movie. Heehee! Thanks!<br /><br />God bless you!
0385736002|5.0|I love this series! The cast of characters is amazing, Nicholas Flamet and Dr. John Dee to say the least.  Plenty of mythical creatures make appearances, and people from the history books who turn out to be immortals. There is a prophecy that may or may not mean the end of the world, and one of the twins may turn to the evil side.  This story is told from both the good side and the bad side, the chapters pretty much alternate views, so that we can see the motivations of both sides.  The book is hinting that Flamel may not be a perfectly good character, and Dee may not be completely evil which is great! I suggest this book to fans of the magic/fantasy genre
0823016714|4.0|This book is all about imagery.  If profile facial images are what you want, this book is for you.  Has a good mix of different people with different race, age, gender...etc.  Would recommend it.
B001GCUER0|5.0|There are a lot of things we see regularly on TV, but there are those few select ones like the Sopranos, The Wire, Dexter which makes you wait for the next episode or season.<br /><br />I have already ordered for Season 2 on preorder.  This one rocks, the cast, the portayal, the sets, the charachters, the script, editing, camera work, and Jon Hamm.<br /><br />This is not the normal run of the mill plots, the screenplay, music, everthing that tells you of those rarely perfectly packed 50 minutes of delight.<br /><br />There is a twist in the tale with every episode, emotions, jealosy, typical of lives in the US
B00000K3CM|5.0|This is the second one I purchased. I needed another because my other DVD got a little worn/scratched up. I thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's better than the first one, and I like the first one too. I will actually watch it in the summer time as well. It's just fun to watch. I will always have one in my DVD collection.
B001AXOFS4|5.0|This is an amazing cd. A \\"must have\\" for anyone's collection. Adele's smooth voice with a jazz sound is beautiful.
0312330529|5.0|I found this book utterly fascinating... I listened to all 35 cd's, read by a wonderful actor, with amazing dialects... However, I think he could have used an editor with tighter restrictions.... He really captured the ambience of Bombay, and it's peoples...I would have liked to know how he left it with Karla, Lisa, and, if he ever re-connected with his family of origin.... Did he ever see his Mother, ex-wife, daughter?  Did he return to Australia?
0307388840|4.0|This was my first Ian McEwan read, and it was a good one. This was an interesting story though not really a whole lot happened in it, and somehow it went for a few hundred pages. The reason for that was McEwan's precise and extensive descriptions of characters' thoughts and the story's various settings. McEwan is rather amazing at imagining the possible details of a one's thoughts, details that most people might not ordinarily be conscious of, but upon reading them ring true. The limited plot is lengthened also by the story being told from several viewpoints, particularly in Part 1. It was all very intelligently done.    But was there really any atonement in this story? At least atonement when it counted? I don't know if the title really applied considering how things turned out.    I hadn't ever planned to see the movie. Seemed to be a chic flick, but after this reading, I plan to rent/on demand it. I guess by being from the England and reading it while on my recent trip there, I appreciated an English story.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I bought it to add to my DVD Disney collection. The whole family loves this movie. It's awesome!
0810970686|5.0|My son has loves this series - and when a 10 year old boy does a happy dance when you buy him the new Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do-It-Yourself Book<br />- I think you have a hit.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|The narration gives me a feeling I'm watching a home movie of a friend touring Spain. The dialogue of Christy and Vicky is very cold, analytical, and underplays the artist-playboy (Bardem) and his hot-tempered ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) for some laughs. The film backfires though by downplaying the bedroom scenes between him and the two girls. Christy also decides after a hot affair with both Bardem and Cruz to split up with them and for twenty minutes we do not know what happened to her. Is the divorcee really crazy? If you had a husband chasing all those girls wouldn't you consider injury or murder? And so the ending did wake me up. While not great Woody, it was a nice effort. Mia Farrow, sleep well wherever you are. Soon Yi, please wake Woody up. This film was not made on one of his viagra days.
014144116X|5.0|I will not summarize the plot of this intricate novel, which is freely available through authoritative sites across the Web.     If you love novels of character and theme, you will love and remember this painstakingly written novel of bigotry and colonialism before Indian independence. The concept which clothes the story: the Caucasian, very proper, very British Miss Quested accuses the Indian, Dr. Aziz, of physical assault in a cave. The facts of the event were literally invisible. The balance of the novel is a clash of cultures, biases and characters, all of which conspire to express \\"reality.\\"    Forster is methodical in way he prepares his readers for the Event and its aftermath.  He writes with the precision of a literary surgeon just as he did in A ROOM WITH A VIEW and HOWARD'S END.    If you'd like explore Forster's writing, this is a fine place to start. Give it a little work and it won't let you down. The author was one of the great masters of the English language and an outspoken adversary of bigotry. Most of us have experienced bias at least once or twice in our lives. For that reason alone, I'd try it.    Forster is also the great exemplar of the modern novel. Few were as consistently aware of form. Few had the ability to infuse raw emotion into such civilized prose.    Go for it.
0307269752|5.0|I loved this book. As someone who's genre of choice is usually not mysteries, I was hesitant at first, but I literally could not put it down. It was one of those books that I was sad to finish because I knew it would be some time before I stumbled on something I enjoyed so much.
0553807048|5.0|laughed the whole time i was reading this and could not put it down.  belfort is self-deprecatingly hysterical.  also some amazing insight into wall street schemes and scams.  crazy thing is all the wild stories are true.  i also like watching the author on CNN talk about the current scandals, he explains it so you can understand it. a must read!
0307388840|1.0|I read this for a book club where a number of the other members had described this as one of their absolute favorite books ever, so I had high hopes.  It became an arduous and unrewarding slog through pedantic, verbose descriptions of landscapes and characters.  I never figured out why I should care for even one second about any of the people in the story, so completely unsympathetic were they.  As a side note, I saw the movie after a friend said it was better than the book, but I found it equally uninteresting.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|I Dream of Jeannie the whole series is fun for the whole family.  I purchased it for my 10 & 13 year olds and we have been having so much fun watching this as a family. We have had so many laughs and conversations have come out of this purchase that I highly recommend it to any family that is looking for some good clean tv time with the whole family.  We look forward to the nights so we can all sit together and watch an episode.  Any age can watch and get ready for the fun.  My 13 year old son laughs from beginning to end - he loves to watch what they do to Dr. Bellows the poor guy!!!  Well worth the price.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This CD is probably one of the best CDs I've heard in a really long time. Great music, great vocals. i would highly recommend this to any coldplay fans!
0743243153|5.0|The Road Less Traveled, 25th Anniversary Edition : A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth by M. Scott Peck is a book that tells it like it is. Peck's not afraid to suggest that \\"life is difficult\\" and personal growth is a \\"complex, arduous and lifelong task.\\" Peck shares intimate stories of his clients as well as his own life stories of hardship and struggle. The book takes you from a life of \\"discipline\\" to \\"love\\" then \\"growth and religion\\" and finally \\"grace\\".
B00127RAJY|5.0|A friend suggested that I purchase this DVD. I spend hours in the gym, and having this program at home has been a life-saver. It is a lot harder than I anticipated and I'm really seeing results! I would highly recommend this program to anyone at any fitness level that is looking to add a little something extra to their existing program - or start a new one!
B001JNNE64|4.0|Let's talk about this Blu-ray from a production aspect, as am assuming most already know the film.    The restored print is fabulous; gorgeous even.  That, combined with not having to turn the disc over (there was one dvd where you did, another where you did not) is alone worth the investment.    The uncompressed audio is also quite beautiful.  Personally I would have liked to have heard more the crowd sounds, both in theater and public scenes, use the surround option a bit more.  Without knowledge of what the audio engineers working on this version had access to, it's hard to be overly critical here, not to mention that can often be a question of personal taste, and the disc really does sound great.    Please note that this disc (at least mine) does NOT default to HD audio!  You have to go into the menu and set it up.  I've noticed that some Blu-ray will default, while others do not.    Ok..  to the director's cut.  While I of course found the new footage interesting, I do not think that all of it was necessary and really illustrated that often the correct choice was made the first time around.  Others have really liked the additions, which brings me to my point.  I really wish these director's cut Blu-rays would offer BOTH cuts to the owner.  Take a lead from the Close Encounters disc, where not only are all four cuts included, but you can toggle between them in real time, and there is even an option of a \\"timeline\\" at the bottom of the screen to compare what was added or deleted.    Extras..  beyond the inclusion of the Mozart cd (a nice touch) there is really nothing new here.  The one extra is the \\"making of\\" which is identical to the one on the dvd.  The commentary is new, and there is the occasional interesting tidbit to be found.    The packaging with the included booklet is very elegant; actually one of the better ones I've seen.    Bottom line, I think most of you will want this because you want this classic film to look great and sound great, and as suchyou will not be disappointed.  Had this on order in advance, and am really enjoying it.
B00011D1OA|5.0|This is a great DVD.  I don't usually watch any of the special features that come with DVDs, but these are worth it.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I first heard of this series when viewing the Golden Globe awards and it intrigued me.  I enjoyed the series very much and especially the fine performances.
0385733577|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book and it's sequel. It is such a welcome trait to base your plot on real historical places and events. I loved it with Dan Brown and I love it here in The Alchemyst.    Being a Pagan and worshiper of Hekate I was somewhat disappointed with parts of it (I won't reveal the plot), but I guess for someone outside the religion it wouldn't be obvious.    The only real problem that I have with this book is the writing style. While it's very engaging and keeps you want for more, Scott makes too many repetitions of sentences. It's a well known technique to make the book larger, but I don't like it and it's kinda annoying.    Other then that, it's a very good read and I recommend it to all fantasy lovers out there.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This was just such an enjoyable read that I would recommend it to basically anyone.
0312383320|5.0|Again, Janet evanovich keeps me turning the pages and making me laugh!! I love reading about the craziness in Jersey!
B001FB55Y4|5.0|Being a Gerard Butler fan I couldn't wait for this movie to be released.  I saw it in the theatre at least 10 times and just had to have the DVD.  Rock N Rolla is very entertaining and a true test of Guy Ritchie's talent.  Love it.
B0019T9FL6|1.0|This is just a bad album. Certainly not Grammy worthy. There are 2 maybe 3 tracks worth listening to. Jennifer has a great voice, but this album sucks.
630463949X|5.0|Great from beginning to end period!!!!  A Big Amen to all the previous reviewers who gave this one a five star rating!!! This is a \\"must-have\\" classic concert dvd from Fleetwood Mac, espcially if you're having a \\"Fleetwood Mac Attack\\"!!! This DVD is the perfert cure. This contains 22 songs, each one of the artists get featured in this concert. You get to enjoy all their classics. I really enjoyed Stevie Nick's & Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and especially Christine McVie. Christine is very, very, talented. I didn't realize she could play keyboards so well. She ended the concert perfectly with \\"Songbird\\". This is a Classic and I highly recommend it!!!

0123694965|5.0|This book blows my mind.  It's exactly what I've felt about games for so long but put into beautiful, well thought out prose.  I am so happy I own this book.  Thank you Jesse Schell!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to without skipping tracks. I'm not typically a country fan, but after hearing her album I'm a Taylor fan.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie of all times.  I have a copy but wanted to get one to give as a gift.  Great price - great movie!
B001TLZRZW|5.0|HUGE points for originality. Especially with respect to the guitar work. the first song on the album, In Your Words has the coolest guitar riff I've heard in years. This isn't just standard \\"chug on the D string and shred a solo\\" type riffing, its really unique, very well thought out and unpredictable but sensable. Put it this way, not a single band out there plays metal the way these two guitarists do. The drum work...its Chris Adler, so its obviously tight, and it sounds like an expansion on the same school of thought used in drumming Sacrament. The drum work and guitar riffs play off one another well. The vocals are a new page for Randy. The growls are harsher than Sacrament, and he does some good melodic screams as well, very Metallica-esque (think Disposable Heroes).     As for the album as a whole...this is one band that manages to go in new directions without losing their classic edge. (The first song is completely pointless, I think, but you just have to move on and go straight to the second). The second song made me instantly think \\"this is so New American Gospel\\". Throughout the album, in between streams of brand new ideas they've never played before, you'll be hit with nostalgic moments from every album they wrote. I even heard a little Burn The Priest in there. Solid stuff, this is a totally unique album. People will ask \\"what band does this sound like?\\" and there is honestly no answer to that question. This is one album that in all seriousness has not been done before.    I'm more of a tech-death fan, which this album is not. Most of the songs made me think \\"This is ridiculously good, but not for me.\\", (altho the second track, In Your Words, is basically the coolest song I've heard in a very long time.) Even as a techie tho, I know good music when I hear it, and despite the fact that this one isn't entirely for me, I still have to tip my hat to these cronies for cranking out one slap-in-the-face of an album. Well done indeed. Whether you like the musicor not, there is no denying the huge level of talent, creativity, and musicianship thats shown in these tracks. Can't make everyone happy, but you sure can show them up, and thats what they did here. Five stars, and a milestone in the history of metal.

At the time the concept of a full orchestra was somthing strange & new, never done before by a rock band.Turns out the result is a CD that has gone down in history as one of the best ever.If you are a Moodys fan & remember this one or you are a fan & don't,eather way this is one you must hear & must have. AAAA!!

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog follows the adventures of the title character as he attempts to go from a second rate Mad Scientist to the top tier of villainy.  The story, told from the villian's viewpoint, is inspired.  The dialog is tight.  The humor strikes just the right balance between campy and silly.  You will catch yourself spontaneously singing the songs for weeks afterward.  Writer/director/producer Joss Whedon at his best. Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day all give top performances.    The commentary track is a separate musical in its own right.  Even if you have never bothered with a commentary track before, you don't want to miss this one.

This album, just like the rest of theirs, first off, is spectacular.  Taking into consideration the fact that most upcoming albums DON'T live up to their expectations, this is TRULY a look at the new horizon of metal and the face it bears.  5 outta 5. . .outta 5 outta 5, and so on and so forth.  Wrath is, even for Lamb Of God, truly a spectacle to hold their name to.  One that not even Metallica can crush. And to think, I AM a Metallica fan. Weird?  Nah.

B001FSDOZO|4.0|I initially bought this for my ex and she said it sounded like Nickelback, only heavier. I finally got myself a copy (don't believe in downloading) and lo and behold Nickelbacks 2008 offering canters out of the stables (sorry, couldn't resist) and picks up the pace pretty much straight away. Full bodied production over solid riffing and party hearty lyrics set the tone on the very first track on what is almost certainly the heaviest 'back album thus far.<br /><br />As the music pounds away you realise that all the same ingredients are here - songs with cheeky lyrics, songs with serious and at times plaintive lyrics, the solic riffing with little in the way of solos - it's just that the whole deal sounds heavier in almost every respect. Now this hasn't done any favous for the few mellower tracks on the album. They too sound heavier and it's not a good look, there is nothing on here that connects in the way Photograph did. But that criticism aside there isn't much wrong on this disc at all as there is something here for pretty much all their millions of fans.<br /><br />In fact the heavier, more foreboding style has even seeped into the cover art and rear cover photo and one gets the impression that despite what Chad Kroeger may have expressed in interviews over the years this attempt at more gravitas, as it were, may actually stem from a desire to be taken more seriously by serious hard rock and metal fans. After all, presumably the hit singles will dry up at some point and then who buys a bands albums? Yep, you guessed it, the rock fans.<br /><br />Another enjoyable Nickelback album to add to their expanding catalogue of success and while the formulaic sounding aspects of their writing are not above reproach and nor is the calculated feel of their career and success thus far, this album does show an artistic desire to be treated more seriously while still having fun and whether posterity will treat them kindly is probably of small concert to their legions of supporters at the time that I write this.<br /><br />Don't fight it, just buy the thing and crank it up.rite this.

B000006NPY|5.0|How to follow up a masterpiece like [[ASIN:0711958858 Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]] (MCIS)? The Pumpkins, fresh off their most successful and critically acclaimed album of their careers, needed to come up with a brilliant answer to that question. Yes they could have ridden MCIS' coattails and produced MCIS #2, but thankfully they chose the much more dangerous path and overhauled their entire sound. ADORE, when released, wasn't the album many Pumpkin's fans hoped for; not as hard as SIAMESE DREAM, nor the whimsical and hard edged MCIS.<br /><br />It was a far more cohesive album thematically as well as musically. A synth influenced electronic vibe predominates, with instrumentation (especially the use of piano) taking center stage. \\"Perfect,\\" along with \\"Pug,\\" the two radio hits from the album, demonstrate the new emphasis on electronic loops and reverbed bass. The change, jarring as it was for old school Pumpkins fans, was ahead of their time: Adore demonstrated that the Pumpkins knew how to change things up and still produce a fantastic album, as well as forge the way for bands to come. Now, with synth the common thread among bands as diverse as THE KILLERS, DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, and STARS, it's clear the Pumpkins knew what they were about.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"For Martha,\\" show the Pumpkin's more intimate side, and a more practiced, more adult observation of the human condition. Billy Corgan said that Adore was intended for a wider audience than MCIS: \\"I'm talking to everyone now. It's a wider dialogue. I'm talking to people who are older than me and younger than me, and our generation as well.\\"<br /><br />Described as some as \\"Goth Rock,\\" Adore defies conventional classification. It isn't an acoustic album, nor a rock album, nor a techno/synth production; it is an amalgamation of styles that just works; it is beautiful, moving, powerful music. It remains one of the most important albums of the 90s, and as time has gone by, proves to be much better than many critics and Pumpkins fans thought at the time.<br /><br />5/5. A masterpiece.mpkins fans thought at the time.     5/5. A masterpiece.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|Over the past several months or so I have spent some time going over the musical influences back in the early 1960's that had an effect on  my political development as I was growing up, or that just caught my ear. Not surprisingly many of those same musical influences still resonate today. Of those early 1960's influences none probably was greater than that of Bob Dylan, no only because he had a different sound but because his super-charged protest-oriented lyrics `spoke' to me. That Dylan could only go a very short distance along that political protest route that others, including myself, had to travel does not negate the important of that influence.     As this very well-done almost four hour in-depth Martin Scorsese documentary makes abundantly clear I was not alone in feeling that influence. Others also felt that Dylan `spoke' to them, if not as the voice of the \\"Generation of `68\\" then for a moment. I have previously reviewed a number of Bob Dylan's early albums (\\"The Free-Wheelin' Bob Dylan\\", \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\", \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\", etc.) in this space as I believe that those albums reflect both the prime period of his musical influence and, when future generations begin to ask their versions of the social questions posed by the 1960's, will be the music they will be pressing to learn 100 years from now.     This documentary is also formatted to reflect fully on that above-mentioned shared underlying understanding of Dylan's career and place in the folk/rock pantheon. The structure of the film also reflects the now standard method of doing a film documentary. Plenty of clips of Dylan's childhood, youth, the early days in the burgeoning folk scene in Greenwich Village in the early 1960's and plenty of clips of early performances up until that decisive period in 1965 when Dylan decided to move in another direction combining his still thoughtful but by then more personal lyrics with an electric guitar (and band to back that sound up). That changeover gets full attention by having clips of the breakthrough Royal Hall concert interspersed through the film. The film thus has its central focus on this switch-over that is a part of what made Dylan so controversial and upsetting to traditional folkies back in the day.    Additionally, this film also has something that is not always the case with biographic documentaries; the subject himself holding forth on the meaning of it all. Most times that would not necessarily be a revelation as such efforts are usually unproductive. Here, however, the notoriously private and generally unresponsive (to interview questions, at least) Dylan contributes his take on what is bound to be used as a primary source for \\"the first draft\\" of his effect on popular music in the late 20th century. Although Dylan generally responded to the interviewers questions here I would argue that for whatever purposes he told no more than we already knew or what he wanted told. Not unusual in the famous but a little maddening here for those, like this reviewer, who happen to be serious looking at the question of \\"the meaning of the 1960's. But, so be it.    Fortunately another feature of theses types of documentaries helped out on that question. The film is heavily seeded with comments, performances and anecdotes by many of the performers still standing and other interested parties of the early 1960's who personally knew Dylan or had something of interest to say about the times. The list of \\"talking heads\\" (to the good here, I usually use this phrase with a little tongue-in cheek\\") brought into this production formed a veritable who's who of those in or around that folk scene at the time.     Most informative of this crowd, not surprisingly, were the late folk historian, Dave Van Ronk, and the, as of this writing, very much alive Pete Seeger who not only performed music but made it their business to know and keep the folk tradition alive. Van Ronk was especially informative about the competitiveness of the early folkies mainly the male ones, as Joan Baez was conceded on the female side to be the \\"queen of the hill\\", to see who would become \\"king of folk\\". He also had interesting comments about the commercialization of folk music and the dreaded \\"selling out to mainstream culture\\". By Van Ronk's account backed up by other sources I have run across as well, Dylan was intensely interested in that battle. Seeger was strongest on the transition, of which he was a seminal figure, of the folk tradition from the older 1930's Great Depression `lefties' like Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Cisco Houston and Lead Belly to the new kids on the block.    Others of note along the way include the afore-mentioned Joan Baez, at one time also Dylan's girlfriend, with some very insightful comments giving us the \\"skinny' of what it was like actually living with such a whirlwind and about the strains on their relationship (and her psyche) of her direction toward more political involvement, and his away from such activity. Liam Clancy (of Tommy Makem and The Clancy Brothers) and Maria Muldaur (most noted then for her key role as singer in the Jim Kweskin Jug Band) add some spice to the conversation. There are many others who have something to say about particular events but of that crowd I would select John Cohen (of \\"The New Lost City Ramblers\\") as most informative about the history of what was going in those times and the schism between the `purists' and those who wanted to `sell out' for filthy lucre. Again, Cohen is not a surprising choice, as \\"Lost City\\" spent much time on tracing the folk traditions (and it included Mike Seeger, Pete's half- brother so you know they were interested in history).        Others have, endlessly, gone on about Bob Dylan's role as the voice of his generation (and mine), his lyrics and what they do or do not mean and his place in the rock or folk pantheons, or both. After viewing this documentary it still seems hard to believe now both as to the performer as well as to what was being attempted that anyone would take umbrage at a performer using an electric guitar to tell a folk story (or any story for that matter). The well-known English Royal Hall performance or that equally well-known three song folk/rock set at Newport in 1965 hardly seem worth getting steamed up about now. It is not necessary to go into all the details of what or what did not happen with Pete Seeger at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 (although this incident gets a full airing by all parties) to know that one should be glad, glad as hell, that Bob Dylan continued to listen to his own drummer and carry on a career based on electronic music.    Note: Although I do not usually spend much time looking through special features sections of DVDs here there are several extras well worth looking at. They include some early performances by Dylan both highlighted in the documentary and others that did not make the cut. Additionally, a number of the \\"talking heads' that are heard in the documentary , including Liam Clancy and Maria Muldaur, do renditions of some Dylan's songs.

This is an updated book full of information that might lessen a lot of the problems going on in the stock market. With over 600 pages of informative wisdom, Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett teaches us how to weave in and out of the stock market whirlpool of buying and selling. It may not stop all of the hits to your portfolio, but it might lessen the damage. The book is deep and for me, a very slow read as I try to take in the information. You may not get rich but it should help you survive the gut wrenching entity known as the stock market. Wouldn't hurt to have it in your home or office library.

1604244674|2.0|Review by Jason Lush<br /><br />One hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.<br /><br />The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing. The whole story could have been condensed to a 30 page novella and would have been enjoyable.<br /><br />And, as a side note to the posthumous Mr. Wilde, forty is not old and hideous.

031606792X|5.0|I heard some mixed reviews before reading this book.  I bought it anyway because I was completely in-love with the first three novels.  I went into reading it with an open mind and I was not disappointed.  I think it was great to finally see Bella and Edward marry.  Though some might see it as an \\"end\\" of sorts, in reality, it is only the beginning.  They get to begin their life as husband an wife.  Plus you have the added suspense of her mysterious pregnancy.    The only complaint I have about this book is on the section from Jacob's perspective.  Though I enjoyed having that part of the story told by him, there is way too much unnecessary dialogue between him and his pack.  The points that were trying to be made could have been made with a lot less space-filling dialogue.  The best parts of that story were the times he spent with the Cullens. The third part of the story, from Bella's perspective as a vampire, has to be my favorite.  It gives a whole new look into what it feels like to be a vampire. I also like how Bella becomes empowered as she discovers her unique strengths and abilities as a vampire.  You see a totally different side of her, a more confident and self-assured side, that was three books in the making. We see just how far Bella has come by what she does in the ending climax, when she becomes the \\"protector\\". And the last scene in the book, when she and Edward are alone in their cottage with Renesmee asleep in her room, I have to say, was the perfect ending to the entire Twilight Series. Stephanie Meyer couldn't have written it better.  Breaking Dawn gave me everything I wanted for these characters, and I was very pleased when I finished it.
0375842209|5.0|I have read many books set around WWII- both fiction and non-fiction.  (Do not let the YA label deter you- I have found that once an author writes for YA/Youth, all their books get labeled with YA!) This is, by far, the most compelling of the WWII fiction novels I have read.  I initially thought the first few chapters a bit slow, but I grew to love the characters and often wept at the harsh conditions they endure.    Death is a sensitive and surprisingly tender narrator; Death takes no glory in carting off the souls who fall victim to the war or holocaust.  Zusak creates an entire book full of interesting detail and characters of great depth--they may hide their feelings under gruff (Rosa) or polite (mayor's wife) exteriors, but they are complex and intriguing.  Hans and Max are unconditional in their support of Liesel, and their acts of love in bartering and creating books for her are amazing.  And I loved the fact that a blond-haired German boy wanted to be just like Jesse Owens- take that, Herr Hitler!    Be prepared for a sad book- but one that is realistic in portraying the hardships of life during oppression and war. Many of the characters defy Nazi authority and try to preserve their compassion and humanity--they are inspiring. Zusak's story telling skills and talent for creating characaters with which you'll empathize are truly remarkable.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|There seems to be two very divergent schools of thought on these remixes. I never had any idea this would be the case. That's because I bought this set (and indeed the '76-'82 and the '83-'98 years) simply because of the 5.1 dvd mixes. It hadn't occurred to me that anyone would spend that much money merely for a new stereo mix. With the stereo mix issue out of the way, I really don't see how anyone could give this set anything less than 5 stars.    I have been a Genesis fan since I was a kid. It was and is my inspiration for my own songwriting. I am 35 years old, now. If you are reading this and don't know much about the band, but are a serious music fan looking for music with genuine depth and inventiveness, just stop reading this now and buy this set. The music contained within this set is some of the most amazing and adventurous ever created in the rock world. I envy those who will be experiencing this music in 5.1 as their introduction.    The DVDs satiate everything a Genesis fan could ever hunger for with the extras. Extensive interviews, live footage, TV appearances, and photos of their tour programmes accompany almost every album. The 5.1 mix is absolutely STUNNING! I would say that this would be an excuse IN ITSELF to go out and get a 5.1 system if you don't already own it. The mix is classy, bringing the music into this century, yet respecting the vintage feel of each album. The Lamb is especially wonderful due to the inclusion of a slide show of footage that was played during the live show as well as some clips of live footage of the band on tour.     The only mistake on this set, is the \\"crunching\\" sound in \\"Colony Of Slippermen\\" from The Lamb when Rael is castrated is omitted. A bit bothersome, but no more than the ommision of the lead guitar line during the end of \\"Misunderstanding\\" from the '76-'82 box set.    Two small errors from the whole catalogue ain't that bad, and well worth it to hear the band in such perfect sound seperation. There are timeswhen it sounds as if Peter or Phil are singing in your ear and Tony's keboard is behind your couch.     And to all the morons whining about the stereo mix - grow the hell up. At least your favorite band isn't Pink Floyd ~ who just repackages their music every few years and doesn't do a thing to give their fans anything new. But then I guess you ARE the same folks who own every single album from the Collins era, listen to them alot, and then complain about how much they sucked after Peter left. But then Genesis has ALWAYS been a band way ahead and over it's fans...
B001TLZRZW|4.0|This is a good release from a band that gets a lot of negative criticism for sparking the new American metal movement.  I have always enjoyed this band and their previous releases.  Wrath is a good album but it doesn't progress much from Sacrament and it sounds like a typical Lamb Of God release.  This isn't necessarily bad but some people may get tired of their repetitive sounds.  I do not get tired of this band though.  I can recommend this album to old and new Lamb Of God fans alike.  It may not be as good as their Burn The Priest days but it certainly isn't bad.    I gave the album a 4 our of 5 as the band has stuck with their formula for a long time now.  Many bands in the metal genre do this just so they don't alienate their fanbase.  This is fine but I prefer it when bands naturally progress and their sound changes (even if the change is slight).

0316168815|2.0|The book starts out fascinating and well written, but completely falls apart 2/3 into it.  I devoured the first 230 pages without stopping and then could barely finish it.  Maybe the author had a page total she needed to achieve in order to get her paycheck.  Besides becoming dull and longwinded, the writing turns sloppy in the last parts and you need to keep re-reading passages (if you can bear to do so) just to understand what point she's trying to make or even who she's writing about.       The author's concept of heaven was completely plausible until she gave the dead child a vacation day back on earth to make up for lost experiences.  That scene is completely ridiculous in the setting Sebold had created.     The ultimate end is so anti-climactic that you WILL feel cheated.  The most interesting plot in the book is summed up in 3 sentences with no connection to the other characters.  Stupid ending, badly written.  I recommend you read to page 230, then skip to the last 3 pages.

B001DHXT6G|1.0|Why does it cost $224.99 to buy the remastered series in one set, while buying the remastered seasons separately costs only $182.97? It seems like Paramount continues to screw up the marketing on the original series, AGAIN. Although the original series pales in comparison to the later Star Trek series, as an avid trekker, I still love it. In any case, a friend of mine has the original series (not remastered) on DVD and it looks no better than my VHS complete collection. I want this remastered series, but it's priced way too high at this time. So I'll wait.     Reading the mixed reviews here has convinced me that packaging defects and quality problems exist, and I fail to understand that. I have the TNG, DS9 and Voyager complete collections on DVD and there are NO defects in any of them. Why is the original series plagued with so many marketing defects? Why is it overpriced, when the newer and much better series are so reasonably priced? As I said, I love this show; but I also spend my money wisely, my advice is to wait until they finally get it right. (This worked with the Enterprise collection, they reduced the price on the complete set).
0920236162|3.0|Great meaning at the end of the story but it kind of just ends abruptly.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|Ther are stickers to put on a jewel case but it comes in a \\"cheap\\" paper cover (even if the artwork is included). The music is, of course, fantastic.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I know I rated the Deluxe Edition but that was just my ranting about the missing songs. Now to the songs and singing. My personal favorites are technically the ones with the older cast but in this list I'll include some of the missing songs:<br />Money, Money, Money<br />Mamma Mia<br />Chiquitita<br />Dancing Queen<br />Our Last Summer<br />Super Trouper<br />The Name of the Game<br />SOS<br />Does Your Mother Know<br />Slipping Through My Fingers<br />The Winner Takes It All<br />I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do<br />When All Is Said And Done<br />Take A Chance On Me<br />Waterloo<br />I don't know what everyone's complaining about with the singing. Compared to \\"Chicago\\", Brosnan was better than Gere and Streep was better than Zellwegger. Yes, \\"Chicago\\" won more awards but this made more money.
B0000683DH|5.0|One thing that many serials use to great effect, but is surprisingly missing in the original series of Star Trek, is the recurring villain. They had a sense of that with the recurring Klingons and Romulans, but we never got to see the same people playing the roles in more than one episode. The only antagonist that ever recurred throughout the entire three year run was Harcourt Fenton \\"Harry\\" Mudd, and he was a bit of a joke at best.<br /><br />However, as much as you may want to laugh at the idea of Mudd as a \\"villain\\", the recurring role allowed the character to become more real. Thus his problems and motivations were more real to us.<br /><br />On the heals of the commercial success of the critically decried \\"Star Trek: The Almost-No-Motion Picture\\", director Nicholas Meyer was determined to prove that Star Trek could be a successful and well reviewed movie franchise. Herein came the great idea: use a villain that the audience already knows.<br /><br />Like all original series villains, Khan Noonian Singh was in only one episode. Yet brilliant writing and Montalban's portrayal of the genetically engineered superhuman created one of the greatest episodes of the entire series. By bringing him in to the story, they not only firmly establish that these movies are the continuing voyages of the crew that started out in the sixties, but the audience could now see the results of one of their most favorite episodes ever. Rarely do we get the rest of the story. Here we see it in larger-than-life effects and played out superbly by the inimitable Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />His hatred of Kirk was believable before he ever mentioned the (then) Admiral's name. There was a terrifying restraint to his deliberate actions, but his eyes always told us that there was much more power and emotion than we were being allowed to see. Shatner gave a wonderful performance in this showdown with a foe he thought to have left behind, but it was Montalban who truly shone through.<br /><br />Superb movie and a wonderful DVD.
0316017922|5.0|I like Gladwell's writing primarily for two reasons.  I like his writing style; it's easy reading and it captures your attention.  He's one of the few author's who I can pickup and read front page to back in one sitting.  Second, I liken Gladwell to someone like Steven Levitt (Freakonomics, etc) in that he's extremely creative in his way of thinking and connecting of ideas.  I don't always agree with his conclusions but he always does a great job of providing supporting evidence to substantiate his thoughts/opinions.  Outliers is a look at what makes people successful and an exercise that delves into various examples (Chris Langan, etc).  If you are reading this you probably already have a good idea as to what the book's about, but, simply put, it refutes the idea that being smart and successful is solely about being traditionally \\"smart\\" (ie. having a high IQ).  What Gladwell argues is that it's about being smart ENOUGH... and then some intangibles (like being able to manipulate someone you're trying to get something from by presenting your case in a way that appeals to them, for example).  If nothing else I think this book is a good read because it provides a different perspective and, generally speaking, a different way of looking at the world.  I think that's something that everyone should be able to appreciate.
B00005JKHP|3.0|This one will only really satisfy the real fans, if even them. The story used here comes from a script that they had worked out for \\"Star Trek Phase II\\", the sequel series that Paramount considered producing in the seventies. As an episode in a long running series, it would have worked. In fact, it largely resembles the basic story for the original series episode \\"The Changeling\\" from the sixties.<br /><br />The bad thing, though, is that, in order to take a story from an episode and make it a 2hr+ movie, they added several long scenes of people waiting and looking at ... something. It's never clearly explained, though it's easier to understand the geometry of V'ger's ship in this Director's Cut, with better special effects. It doesn't help the slow plotting, but it eliminates a bit of the confusion.<br /><br />In the end, there are some classic Trek moments here and there, but you have to wade through this plodding movie to get to them. Basically, the best thing to come out of this movie is that it proved that people still had a desire for more Trek. It did monster business when it came out, but people soon realized it wasn't all they'd hoped. The studios wised up before making the next one, but they could see that there was a market.<br /><br />More specific to this DVD release, the special features are quite interesting if you like understanding how movies are made.<br /><br />Just remember, this movie is really best viewed by those who already love the series and can forgive a misstep here and there.
B001AII4RM|4.0|First off this movie is loosely based on a poem written between the 8th and 11th century.  The poem was one of my favorite when I read it in high school.  The movie is a fairly good telling of the poem but the big story for this film is that it is animated.    The animation is fantastic.  It is very close to realistic.  If you were amazed by [[ASIN:B00006ADD3 Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within (Single Disc Edition)]] you will be blown away by how much animation has improved.      The biggest disappointment is that the characters animations are real people.  It would have been better if the characters were unknowns or totally fabricated people.  It was hard to watch Hannibal Lecter and Mrs. Smith as characters in this movie and would have made it much more immersive if I had never seen the actors before.  Hopefully future animated movies will use \\"fake\\" people so we will not connect characters over different movies.
B00006G8HX|3.0|It's rare to be able to literally bring your big characters back from the dead. Just as it's rare to truly revive a series that is considered to have \\"run its course.\\" But just like the first Star Trek movie brought back a series that many looked on fondly, but without expectations, this movie brings back a character that was sacrificed in one of the most heart tugging scenes in all 500+ hours of Star Trek. Unfortunately, this time out has a few pacing problems.<br /><br />This is Nimoy's motion picture directorial debut, and he performs solidly enough, though there are a few moments here and there where it simply feels like there's something ... missing. It's hard to describe.<br /><br />That's not to say it isn't worth a watch. If you plan on seeing Star Treks II and IV, this is a must see. But there are also some scenes that are just superbly done. The scene breaking McCoy out of the security cell has classic Trek charm. And the scene where the Klingons kill one of the hostages and Kirk reacts is absolutely excellent. He stumbles and completely misses his chair. We see the captain -- this man we have seen beat astronomical odds with a bluff, who has faced the destruction of Earth or the forceful invasion from another galaxy without even a twitch in his jaw -- we see this great captain completely exposed and despondent.<br /><br />This is an excellent addition to the Star Trek mythology and a truly great DVD release.
0345457692|5.0|I've recently returned to SF after a long absence and have been thrilled at how the genre has grown.  I actually purchased this book by accident.  It was on my wish list but I intended to re-read some vintage Robert Heinlein.  I must have mis-clicked because this showed up instead.  What a happy accident.      I absolutly love this book and this authors concept for a main character.  As has been commented on already, it's the personality of Phillip Marlow (with amazing abilities) transferred into whatever \\"sleeve\\" suits the story.  The concept eliminates any issues of characters physically growing too old and feeble to be plausible as the protaginist.      I've read a few series that have been undone by this trap and it's unfortunate for both the author and the reader.  You want the characters to keep going on and on into new story lines but the timeline has essentially written them off. No such problems here.  Just \\"wake him up\\" and set him off on a new adventure in a \\"new\\" body and in any time period.    It's also a nice bonus to have discoverd an \\"established\\" authors first novel in this way because now I have a whole body of work I can read through and enjoy.
