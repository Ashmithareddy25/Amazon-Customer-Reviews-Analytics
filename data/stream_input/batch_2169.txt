B00BHMF578|3.0|According to news reports they breezed through security. And the plane was not followed by police on runway. Too much hollywood dramatization. This ruined it for me
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this one dosent take as much space as the other one does and it has years worth of gameplay because the multiplayer the main story is very put together theres many guns to its awsome just buy it

0071752854|3.0|'The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'who is to be master -- that's all.'<br /><br />That slightly edited quote from Lewis Carroll would serve as a fitting epigraph for this book.  It's about how to become the Alpha Male even when the other party seems to have all the advantages.<br /><br />The first 94 pages of the book describe how to bully or trick the other side into paying attention.  I'm sure the game truly is played this way in many corners of world finance.  But if you're not secretly wishing you were the star in an action thriller, if you believe in win-win deals and civilized behavior, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />I did not learn a single thing I could apply with my personality in my own business world, and I literally could not read any further.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very entertaining. My teen daughter and I watched several times. Very up to date and teaches good moral lesson on friendship.
B009YMMEVI|4.0|I purchased the extended edition after watching the original release.  Both versions are fun films that explore relationships among people through the vehicle of birding.  Two key differences: 1) The extended version looks at the competitive efforts among the three birders more objectively than the original release, and 2) the extended version offers a little more information about the ecology of Neotropical migratory birds and the perils of migration than the original release.  If you are already familiar with birding and North American migrating birds, then the extra information is just that: extra, not significantly added to the story.  If you are not familiar with birds or avian migration and want to enjoy a story along with some biology, the extended version is for you.  If you are not familiar with birds and want a more singular human-centered storyline rather than a semi-complete parallel avian plot, stick with the original release.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the most addictive games I have played. Even after you finished the game you play it over to try to do better.

8866130915|3.0|This Notebook is absolutely impossible to write in as a man. I can not hold the page open and hold and pen cramped over trying to scribble notes into the small surface area of the book. I would not suggest any man get one of these in this particular size. I would go for one of their larger models, because the pages of these feel so soft, but are fairly durable, and giving someone a note written on a piece of this paper feels very classy. The outer shell of the book is pretty resilient too, and is sealed well by the attached elastic band.

B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Camelot basks in the halcyon days of a New Golden Age. Arthur has been king for 3 peaceful years, but now an expedition to the frozen lands of Ismere has lead to the disappearance of Gwaine, Percival & others, they have been captured by Morgana & Ruadan a fellow sorcerer but why? Arthur & Merlin must undertake a dangerous mission into the unknown to find out. Arthur & Merlin arrive in a village that has been attacked & a dying druid tells Merlin of 'Arthur's Bane' a battle where the young king will be slain. Morgana is trying to locate a mystical key sending her captives deep into the mines below the fortress she aims to find it at all costs. Arthur intends to travel through Queen Annis' lands in order not to be detected but is betrayed by Sefa - Guinevere's maid to her father Ruadan. Arthur & Merlin are trapped by Mordred, whom Merlin recognizes from the prophecy as being Arthur's killer. Merlin & Arthur are close to exhaustion, but are shown some kindness by Mordred but what is his motive? However Merlin & Arthur escape & get into the fortress via the mines & find that Gwaine after being attacked by his captors has been protected by a spirit called the Euchdag who is herself the Diamar, the 'Key' which Morgana is seeking. Mordred saves Arthur from Morgana's attempt to kill him & is rewarded with a Knighthood on returning to Camelot. Only one thing is now certain: The Great Trial for Albion has finally begun.<br /><br />Arthur rescues an old woman accused of sorcery, as she lays dying she gives him a horn with which he can summon the dead, unable to resist temptation he seizes the chance to speak to the person he misses most, his father, but the spirit world is a dark & dangerous place. His father berates him for marrying a servant girl, knighting ordinary young men on merit & his lack of cruelty to instill fear into his subjects. Arthur does not realize he has released his father's poltergeist, Uther starts to wreak havoc in Camelot - injuring Percival & trying to kill Guinevere. When Gauis tells Arthur that only he can return his father to the spirit world, he & Merlin set out to find Uther, when Uther finds & tries to kill Merlin, Merlin tells him that there has been magic at the heart of Camelot for years & just as Uther is about to tell Arthur about Merlin, Arthur blows the horn to return his father to the spirit world. Princess Mithian arrives in Camelot asking Arthur to help rescue her father King Rodor who is hiding from Odin the man who killed Uther, but Rodor is actually Odin's prisoner & the elderly woman who travels with Mithian is Morgana in disguise who is controlling Mithian with an enchanted bangle. Mithian is able to tell Merlin about Morgana whilst they are traveling but it's too late & Merlin is knocked out by Morgana. The knights leave Gaius & Gwaine to look after Merlin, while they carry on to their impending doom. With Arthur & his knights now captives it falls to Merlin & Gwaine to rescue them & then for Merlin to encourage Arthur to make peace with Odin. In the inky depths of an ancient pool, three soothsayers cast a dark judgement upon the king of Camelot. Osgar gives Arthur a rune mark from the Disir telling him that he must allow magic or face the consequences. Arthur & his men go to the caves to seek out the Disir, when they attack Mordred is fatally wounded trying to protect Arthur, who begs for the life of Mordred only to be told that in return for his life Arthur must allow magic to return to Camelot & he himself must embrace the Old Religion. Advised by Merlin who knows about the prophecy of the Druid boy & his part in Arthur's death tells Arthur to refuse which he does, but when they return to Camelot there is an unwelcome surprize waiting for Merlin on the steps of the castle.<br /><br />After visiting her father's grave with Elyan, Guinevere is captured by Morgana who then takes her to the Dark Tower which is haunted by ghostly visions & screams designed to send the prisoner mad. Arthur & his men set out to rescue her little knowing that one of them will not live to fight another day. When Guinevere returns to Camelot she seems to be a changed woman but why? Darkness steals into the very heart of Camelot as Morgana & her puppet queen hatch a sinister plan to murder the king. When Arthur is thrown from his horse his saddle has been tampered with & the stable hand Tyr is blamed & imprisoned, he tells Merlin that he knows who tampered with the saddle but they threatened to kill his mother if he talked. When he is found dead the following morning Arthur realizes he was wrong but his fate has already been sealed. Guinevere poisons Arthur's wine & there is little time for Merlin to save him, but Guinevere blames the poisoning on Merlin to divert suspicion from herself to ensure she will be made Queen in her own right after Arthur's death. Merlin has to escape from the cells to help the dying Arthur but can he get there in time.... In the dead of night a young druid boy seeks out Merlin begging him to go with him to his village to save his dying sister, Merlin leaves with Daegal but soon realizes he has made a terrible mistake, the boy has lead him into a trap laid by Morgana who poisons him leaving him to die a slow & painful death. Meanwhile Arthur is preparing to host the ruthless Sarrum of Amata hoping to form an alliance with him. Guinevere meets the Sarrum & makes a bargain with him, if he kills Arthur they could share power together, but the Sarrum has other ideas he plans to kill them both & take Camelot for himself. Daegal is guilt ridden & returns to the dying Merlin, after helping Merlin to recover the pair of them race back to Camelot to stop the assassination attempt. Merlin is more determined than ever to find out the cause of Guinevere's strange behavior. Guinevere meets Morgana in the dead of night, but unbeknown to them both they are being watched by Merlin & a disbelieving Arthur who now sees the reason for Guinevere's strange behavior. Emrys seeks out the Dochraid to find out how Morgana's spell can be broken, only to be told that the queen must enter the Cauldron of Arianrhod of her own will to have the spell broken. Arthur & Merlin drug Guinevere & head for the lake but are followed by a suspicious Mordred. When they reach the lake Merlin disappears but then reappears as the Dolma, asked by Arthur as to where Merlin is she replies 'Oh the gangly boy' saying she is holding him as surity, Arthur persuades Guinevere to enter the lake by getting her to remember their love for each other, the Dolma recites her incantations to lift the curse. A grateful Arthur can't thank her enough but the Dolma says all she wants in recognition is for Arthur to realize that magic can be used for good as well as evil, Mordred tells Merlin he knows the true identity of the Dolma but he will not tell Arthur.<br /><br />Morgana captures Alator to make him say who Emrys is. Merlin meets a woman who tells him The Great Battle is nearing & if he values his King he must meet her at the Temple of Erui. Merlin tells Gaius about her, to protect him Gaius tells Arthur there is a sorceress working in Camelot & where to find her. Mordred leads a party to capture her while she is meeting Merlin, but the pair escape. Morgana finds a note on Alator sent by Finna & sets out to find her. Merlin follows marks left on trees by Finna but is found by Percival & is made to stay in camp but Mordred lets him slip away during the night, he goes to meet Finna but they are ambushed & Merlin is hit by an arrow, they make it to an Old Watch Tower but are followed by Morgana, Finna sends Merlin to the roof for safety & gives him a small box telling him it will help him in the dark days to come & Alator said not to trust the Druid boy, she asks Merlin to give her his sword & to protect Merlin's identity she sacrifices her life. Merlin who is near death calls Kilgharrah who takes him to safety & heals his wound. Merlin & Gaius open the box which revealsa dreadful prophecy that will take place on the Plains of Camlann. Mordred finds himself torn between loyalty & love, but doesn't realize the path he is about to take will define Camelot forever.... Mordred meets Kara a fellow Druid with whom he was once in love, she is injured & needs his help. Merlin finds out about Kara but agrees to keep Mordred's secret. When Arthur & Merlin find her in the cave she tries to kill Arthur & is sentenced to death, Mordred pleads for mercy for her but Arthur refuses. Mordred helps Kara escape but they are soon recaptured & thrown into the cells & Kara is executed. Mordred's powers become all consuming & he escapes from his cell, Merlin fears this will tip him over the edge & the prophecy of the Druid boy killing Arthur will finally come true, sure enough Mordred goes to Morgana & in his anger reveals the true identity of Emrys.<br /><br />Morgana & Mordred are preparing for war to destroy Emrys, Arthur & Camelot once & for all. Morgana sends the Gean Canach to Camelot to rob Merlin of his powers. Merlin knows he cannot help Arthur without them so he tells him this time he cannot go into battle with him as he has another mission to fulfil, Arthur is amazed, just at the time he needs his friend the most he deserts him. Merlin knows that to regain his powers he must go to the Crystal Cave. So as Arthur leaves for Camlann, Merlin heads to the cave. Morgana finds out & follows him, when they get to the cave Morgana traps Merlin inside knocking him unconscious, when he wakes he sees an vision of his father who tells him not to give up hope. Merlin goes deeper into the cave, in one of the crystals he sees Morgana planning a surprize attack, & tells Arthur via a dream. The Crystal Cave restores his magic & he becomes more powerful than ever. Arthur tells his Knights the battle will help create the United Kingdoms. As the battle rages Arthur is heavily outnumbered, & it seems he is fighting a losing battle. When all seems lost a sorcerer suddenly appears & turns the battle in Arthur's favor, Arthur & Mordred duel, Mordred says 'You gave me no choice' as he wounds Arthur but Arthur has the strength to kill Mordred before passing out. When Arthur wakes Merlin is by his side & reveals it was him on the battlefield as the sorcerer, Arthur is hostile towards him, but advised by Gaius he allows Merlin to take him to the healing Lake of Avalon. On the journey Arthur comes to appreciate everything Merlin has ever done for him & sees him with a new found respect, even softening his attitude to magic. Morgana is pursuing them, thinking that at last her brother is dying she will now become the rightful Queen of Camelot, but Merlin has other ideas & kills her with Excalibur. Knowing that Arthur is dying Merlin calls Kilgharrah to take them to Avalon, but they are too late & Arthur dies in Merlin's arms. Kilgharrah tells Merlin that Arthur is the 'Once & Future King' & when Albion's needs are greatest he will rise again. Merlin sends Arthur's body to the island & returns Excalibur to the lake. The next time we see Emrys is in the present day as he passes the Lake of Avalon, Arthur's Eternal Resting place.<br /><br />Will we ever need Arthur & Merlin again?

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|If you can get past the mushy teenage romance, it is actually a pretty good plot. I liked it in the end.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing! It left me so happy and so  overcome with sadness that it's  hard to explain, but definitely a must read!!!!!!#####
B0047SF41G|4.0|i'm a big sci-fi fan and I like the franchise just thought it would be nice to see this one again
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Such a wonderful CD - we listen to it in the car, while making dinner, while eating dinner, or just when we want to be silly and dance around.  Family friendly, no vulgarity.  Three generations in my family are Lady A fans.  Great!
1451648537|5.0|Excellent read about a flawed but brilliant visionary who was able to capitalize on his ability to understand what products could enhance our lives and then convince us we could not live without them.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|Forget all the past releases and rerecording’s. The master tapes have been found at Universal Studios and Intrada has given us the COMPLETE score of Conan the Barbarian. The wait is over, every cue in the film and alternate cues are here on the first two discs. And for the purists, there's the 1982 release of the score on the third disc. It is pricey, but hey - it's frickin' Conan the Barbarian - get it while you can.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book took me a while it was outstanding with its emotions.<br />Also, my favorites is when they are in the arena
B00908DDZM|5.0|If you missed Macklemore & Ryan Lewis on Letterman, they'll perform on SNL in March. Lyrical genius, love this fresh play, more more MackleMORE!!!
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I think it is an awesome game but it's hard to have fun with the number of ads that have. They want you to buy your way out of watching ads. I find it very frustrating to have an ad every five seconds.
B009Y2KGSQ|4.0|Steve Tyler and friends are the bomb!After all these years they still know how to give the fans a good time.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I really like this case. It's durable and well-made. It has slots in the front cover that hold cards (credit, debit, transit, library, driver's license, etc.) or cash. It uses a magnetic catch that keeps the cover closed, even when it's in my tote bag or purse. There's a sturdy flap that holds the Kindle Fire securely in the case. There are openings that accommodate the power cord and headphones. There are openings in the top for the speakers so the sound isn't muted. The only negative is the Kindle Fire gets hot during prolonged use and the case tends to hold in the heat. It hasn't been a problem, but I only use it indoors. On a hot day at the beach or just sitting outdoors, it might overheat.
B002RVCD6O|2.0|I rented this movie to watch on the airplane on my iPad.  Disappointed to find that a download option wasn't available.  No wifi on the plane so a wasted purchase.  Amazon needs to have a better notification on instant rental limitations.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome cool nice I really love it it it so awsome cool I am speech less no yes no yes by by by by
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a fun game but nothing to rave over.  Here are my likes and dislikes:<br /><br />LIKES:<br />-Good Graphics<br />-Easy Controls<br />-Fun (for awhile)<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />-Got boring fast<br />-I do not like the idea of vandalizing someone else,s property then running from a cop.  It did not say that on the discription!<br /><br />All in all, its a fun game.<br /><br />-Serena
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I thought this was going to be the best game ever but it was boring. The characters are really cute, but it's the same thing over and over again. Fling the bird, try to smash a pig. Maybe it's just a quirk, but it's so SLOW. It takes ten to fifteen seconds for the screen to reset after each bird gets shot at the pigs, then about twenty seconds between each new game. That's not fun.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I bought this case for my daughter's Kindle.  She loves the color and the features this case has.  It seems to be of very good quality and should last her quite a while even though she tends to be rough on everything!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's very fun! U get everypony in this fantastically well made game. The graphics are very good as well I hope you enjoy playing
B007REV4YI|5.0|Loved this movie in theartre and I collect all 007's movies. Will watch them over and over again. But to loose Dame Judy Dench is a travesty to us all as &#34;M&#34;.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. The graphics are really nice and the story is good. I played it straight through and loved it!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|William F. Buckley Jr. stated that this was the greatest movie ever made;  in a time where we are at risk of forgetting just how bad this was, I am inclined to agree all the more.  There were many fold more Stasi per citizen than Gestapo.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get the game while its in beta because it will get expensive and all of the updates will be free
B008220C56|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre and had to have it at home. The scenery is fantastic, plot line is a bit odd until you catch on that life is a stage, ever revolving around other's lives and the world about them.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I enjoyed this game, but it could have lasted a little longer. The story was interesting, but the hint feature wasn't always helpful. The puzzles weren't too difficult but they sometimes required a delicate touch. Overall it's a good game worth purchasing.
0446582778|5.0|Howard Elias, a despised lawyer who made a living suing the LAPD, is found dead along with another woman.  The Robbery and Homicide Division is being sued by Elias, so they can't be on the case.  Instead, Harry Bosch and his team are called in to investigate.  The cops are the main suspects, but Chief Irving informs Bosch to \\"let the chips fall where they may.\\"<br /><br />The city is closely watching the investigation, and if the killer turns out to be a cop, it's a no-win situation. If the cops are found innocent, the city most likely will riot, charging a whitewash. Bosch receives a call telling him to not screw the cops and let the case go.<br /><br />Michael Harris, an ex-con, was Elias' witness in the case vs. the LAPD.  He is also the main suspect in the killing of Stacey Kincaid, the daughter of a wealthy and influential car czar in LA.  Bosch starts to think that Harris is innocent and that Elias was killed because he was getting too close to discovering who killed Stacey Kincaid.  Was Harris a patsy?  How much did Stacey Kincaid's parents know about her death.  Why did Bosch old partner, Frankie Sheehan, end up the apparent victim of a suicide?<br /><br />Of course, Bosch is relentless is pursuing the answers.  And, even after the case has been closed, Bosch can't let loose ends alone.  It's why we admire Harry Bosch.<br /><br />This is one of Michael Connelly's earlier works, first published in 1999.  It won't disappoint long-time fans.
0609610570|4.0|This book was written with conservative values still ruling the day.  It was a breath of fresh air in that it still held people responsible for the success or failure of an entity.  Just as a ship needs only one captain, management style used to recognize bottom line decision makers leading by decisive paths to go based on expertise and track record.  Now a days, liberal mindset in Washington becomes diseased with 'paralysis by analysis' where committee after committee must waste valuable executive time in attempting to make a decision, where years before, an experienced leader motivated execution from Jr. Execs towards a certain finite vision.<br />Sadly, ... management style has changed where a leader or manager is merely a 'coach' coaxing performance out of lack luster employees who have learned that mediocrity or substandard performance still pays the same salary, moreover,  hiding in anonymity through union representation or grievances toward those that attempt to motivate by a doctrine applieds to all of 'expect and inspect'.<br />Overall, this book professes the techniques that once were successful in a rational, conservative vein, ... I pray that we return to a more structured, top led management style in 2016, ... both in Federal Bureacracy down to the smalles retail concern, ... its what made this country great to begin with.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Fabulous movie that I saw in the theatre. Had to have it as I have also saw the production on stage in London and the new production in the states that is now touring. have also ordered the 1935, 1942 versions as well to compare all the versions and how they compare to each other. Wonderful story of how we must learn to forgive, care for each other and live in grace. It is also the story of the French Revolution for the freedom of the people to be educated as was their right and not for just the elite. A must watch.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|This game is okay but not one of my favorites. The action is sometimes confusing, since the &#34;ball&#34; splits apart and you have to try to follow several of them at once. The action is very fast, which I liked, but there's just too much going on. It's good for those times when I'm wide awake, drinking coffee and feeling sharp. It's not so good when I'm tired and just want a game that moves quickly but requires less attention to detail. The visuals are very nice and the action is smooth, with no freezing or glitches.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|such a great game a lot of fun it kept me entertained for hours.  the graphics were really good.  The story line was great also.  I enjoyed this very much.  I cant wait to play the next one.

B008ASGP3U|3.0|Inspector Rebus has lost his edge .He needs to be working not vacillating about his retirement and he needs a romantic interest.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I liked the look of this game but it didn't last long enough. The story was okay, but not great. The puzzles weren't difficult and the hint button usually worked okay. Sometimes it would get stuck and would loop back to the same spot over and over again.
B00846F1YW|4.0|it was my first mystery/search/puzzle type game and i enjoyed it.  you dont have to think too hard but it was a challenge.  a nice mix of games and a good way to pass the time.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The beginning was very slow, if it hadn't been on at the movies at the time I may not have carried on, interesting ending.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Redundant and boring. Not at all what i expected. .  The actual information and so-called death experience was only a small part of the book the rest was filler in my opinion
B0000046W9|5.0|If you like Stan Getz, you need this  compilation of his best Bossa Nova recordings. Hard to find today, but exquisite. Getz was restless musically and always ahead of his time. A gifted musician, he could play every instrument but focused on the saxophone--to our ever lasting pleasure. Getz dropped out of school to tour with big bands while still in High School--so young that bandleader Woody Herman had to sign on as his guardian. Nicknamed &#34;the Sound&#34; because of the purity of his tone, Getz jumped genres like an Olympic gymnast--one of his least known but most heard pieces is the saxophone solo to Huey Lewis & the News' hit &#34;Small World&#34;. If you love Getz you must have this collection; if you like jazz, it's a chance to hear the man who set the bar for saxophone virtuosity at his finest.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this program everyday and love it!  Well worth the $2.00 I spent on it.  Very helpful app to have on my kindle fire hd
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is one of the best books I ever have known. To appreciate it though, you have to know India a little bit.<br />Henriette De Lair

B007FY9ZWI|5.0|My teenager loves this thing and all his friends want one - of course teen agers love tech stuff and music.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Great game but it needs to be updated. I'm more concerned about a certain bug than extra items. I play for about an hour or so, then exit to take a break, then when I come back, every block that I place or removed is gone! My house chests, everything, it only lets you keep the stuff in your Inventory. Please fix!!!!
1419705849|5.0|Super fast delivery and great price! This is a cute and entertaining series that both my sons and daughter enjoy! Highly recommend for readers age 7 to 12!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Characters developed well, story line moved along.  Some words that must be common in Great Britain I wasn't sure of their meaning and the Kindle dictionary didn't have.  Fortunately it did not detract from the story, just left some disccriptions with less detail.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|The story lines and the character development for the first season are well thought out and approached from a &#34;procedural&#34; or episodic type of sic-fi drama. In the second season the show delivers on the mythology that accumulates throughout the first season in a more concrete and linear fashion. Season One contains lots of clues thrown in but not in order of importance or in any clear sequence which is the key to not feeling like you are being spoon-fed some conspiracy theory that is oversimplified just to make this a mainstream show like CSI or NCIS or UPS911.<br /><br />The time you invest in this show pays off throughout the series but don't expect to figure it all out by the 4th episode. Who would want to anyway? Ana Torv and Joshua Jackson lead an amazing cast so don't be surprised when you find yourself watching 6 episodes back to back without noticing it's 3am already.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|It is a good read.  It is a management book, on how good performance and QA/QC team efforts does not need to be complicated.  I think the next book in the evolution could be &#34;Lean Checklists&#34;.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I have watched Spartacus since the beginning and loved Andy Whitfield as an actor (rest in peace).  This television series is absolutely amazing, but not for the faint of heart.  There is alot of violence and adult content, but the cinematography and the plot are fantastic.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|She doesn't sound like all the others; has a deep, soulful voice. Each song is a different beat and rhythm. Could listen to Adele all day.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good characters and interesting story line. Fast, easy read very entertaining.  Will for sure read more books from Ms. Flynn.
B007H1HQW0|1.0|I followed the nearly impossible to understand directions, and then attempted to use this on a bottle.  Well, it doesn't work.  Even if you watch the video of the woman demonstrating the video on youtube (search for G2 bottle cutter), she has trouble getting the thing to stay put.  Also the music in the video SUCKS, but that's another issue.  Anyway, I got to the part where I was supposed to put the \\"cutter\\" 90 degrees from the bottle.  Well, there is no blade and there is no cutter.  I loosened the bolt to adjust it and the whole thing fell apart.  Then I tried to see if the cutter would even work, since I couldn't find a blade ANYWHERE.  I took the piece that supposedly had a cutter on it, and held it to a bottle and pressed REALLY hard to see if anything would happen.  Nothing.  I scraped it along the bottle and there was no mark.  I pressed harder; still no mark.  By that time I couldn't put the thing together again so I will throw it away and all the bottles I saved.  Well, I will recycle them and actually donate this useless thing to Goodwill.  Unless you have endless patience and perhaps two or three assistants who are all very dextrous, do not buy this.  It's a waste of your time and money.

B000QRIGLC|2.0|The story itself is amazing on the face of it - Luttrell survived through a mixture of grit and blind luck. He credits his training and God and the fact that he is God's gift as a SeAL but that's the long and the short of it.<br /><br />Even with a ghost writer, the narrative is shaky at best.<br /><br />Just another SeAL cashing in on his experience and blowing his trumpet. And maybe they've earned that right - that's not the issue. The issue is,this is a really terribly written book with cardboard cutout characters and plot development. Happy he made it out and that he is milking this to enrich his family and charities - all very honorable. Just wish the book had been worth a spit.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|What can you say its great and its Rod Stewart. It made me feel like Christmas was here in a really good way.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I have purchased the entire Jesse Stone series. Tom Selleck is at his best in this series. I hope he keeps making more episodes.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|Some may think this is unrealistic, but Homeland Security has a plan for it at: [...]<br />FEMA has a recommend plan for each home in America at: [...]<br /><br />And if you Google CDC Pandemic Preparedness, you will find they have lots of plans as does the Red Cross, and US Department of Health and Human Service.  A lot of smart people take this risk seriously.<br /><br />This movie is reportedly a realistic expectation by the CDS of a serious pandemic.  Like most movies there are times where they are doing something stupid and you're thinking \\"Don't do that\\" but in reality, lots of people would be unprepared.  Hopefully this is both entertaining as a suspenseful movie, but also thought provoking and educational.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|the items were a bit more challenging than other games. I didn't like the back and forth though. would have liked more scenes. that would have gotten me more into the stairy. overall good game.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|here are all the wonderful Bond themes that i had heard before and the second cd has incidental music from the films that all recall the movies that they are from. now that Skyfall has just been released i will have to look for the next collection to include more songs. i have a few albums from some early Bond films, not too many so far. i do have all of the films though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have had this app since Christmas and I really enjoy it.I enjoy saving up for characters and gadgets and travelling round many different places with it such as New York and Rio. I do not think there is any faults but that is just my opinion.<br />Overall I rate this app 5 star because it is really good fun!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is one of the greatest games ever, just love it even tho I am not very good at it.  I am a g-grandma and it is just as fun for me as it is for the kids, everyone should have this in their game apps.<br /><br />sEe
0142004413|5.0|This book is simply incomparable. Classic Durrell, packed with tall tales and descriptions that will whisk you away to the sunny isle of Corfu. Enjoy!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|this one is a great movie, from the stand point of super hero films that is. this is fun with all of the actors from their own films that came before it. all the Marvel Super Hero movies are full of cgi special effects and lots of action so it is the summer films of a few years that the Avengers fit into. not exactly like the comic books that they were originating from, and updated for the 2000s. it all come together now in a real good movie. with a lot of plot and personality in it. the best acting goes to Iron Man aka Robert Downing Jr, he acts the part of Tony Stark as a drunken genius egotist learning to get along with others. Nick Fury as Samuel L Jackson is in authority and commands respect. the Hulk is sympathetic with Mark Ruffalo in green skin, Captain America played by Chris Evans from his own movie the origin story, fills the part of inspiration and tactics leader and is cute too. a Norse god Thor as big as life in Chris Hemsworth's body with armor from Asgard to look like something out of mythology itself. the new guys the Black Widow and Hawkeye are both featured in this film, each hero gets his time in the spotlight. this is comic book readers dreams of super heros come to life. a wonderful movie.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Not exactly a romantic movie, but still good to watch with your lover.  As always Helen hunt is spectacular, and hawkes did great Ina tough role.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Yet again Rollins creates a fantastic sigma force novel. One the best of the series and a good read if you are interested in American history.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game has awesome characters upgrades and mystery boxes also amazing graphics just one thing that's what makes it okay than fabulous is if you don't play it for a while it will lose all its memory.
B00914JWSW|5.0|another wonderfuly sung album...probably the best singer in music these days. very satisfying. i love hearing Streisand sing, more than any one now popular, and loud and able to scream. she just stands and belts out with great feeling songs that melt your heart. i can't enjoy these wigglers, and want-a-be dancers who can't do anything but show there tits and jiggle and strut and scream. so i am old fashion and like to see singers sing not move around. i don't agree with her politics and i have stopped going to all her movies because they are too political for me but i still by her music year by year. still one of my all time favorite singers.
0756404738|5.0|This is the best novel I have read.<br />It will memorize you and keep you reading page after page, you'll long for the next book just like me.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|love this series - very well written, keeps you engaged the whole time without giving away what is going to happen next.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|It is a movie that both parents and kids can enjoy together! It truly shows the love between a boy and his dog.
0316056871|5.0|If you're a 30 Rock fan, this is a must read. Tina Fey's telling of her younger years at home, followed by her trail from comedy clubs to prime time TV is hilarious. The self-deprecating humor gives you an insight into her personal life and her skill as a comedian that has gotten her where she is today.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Always gripping first to last. Never tire of Harry Bosch. Nice to read a book you can't figure out in the first chapter
B008TTPQXA|2.0|Its ok ... its a bit out there and not really what you think you will see and a bit too technical.
B008133MDK|5.0|BBC's Sherlock is one of the best shows of all time. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is fresh and entertaining, and he really nails the persona. Much better than just having an egotistical, airy personality. I love the mental disorder take. Martin Freeman does a great job as Watson, providing the perfect match to Cumberbatch's Sherlock. He's able to provide perfect wit and manner, along with the touching trust and loyalty that you would expect.<br /><br />The episodes are all an hour and a half long, so they are each like their own little movie. But, the tackle some of the best mysteries from the books, and the show, from beginning to end, is so clever. Not to mention the large plot that follows throughout the show. Everything ties together so well, in the end. It's also a great intellectual show, as they give you all the clues and hold out solving until the end, leaving you to put everything together and make your best guess.<br /><br />I heard season 3 was going to be the last season, so we'll see. Either way, I'm looking forward to it!<br /><br />Would highly recommend.
030758836X|1.0|I know it's super popular right now, so I'm obviously in the minority, but I thought this book was very foul and crude. I don't need the f-bomb every sentence, and crude references to sex and body parts in order to get that a character is gruff. The relationship between the main characters is sick and twisted, too. The book left me feeling sad and hopeless, not delighted at the telling of a good yarn.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I almost cried when SPOILER Jack died SPOILER ENDED I am done with the series and it is one of the worst times in a reader's life the book was amazing and Alex finally had a gun except he had to name him Julius I kept thinking of DQ the book had action sadness and humor but Horowitz should make another series kinda like the lost heroes of Olympus by Rick riordan (another one of my faves) and make it focused on someone else
B004TSXUWY|5.0|Brilliant book - easy to read and you wont want to put it down! Loved it!<br /><br />A bit like 50 first dates but with a thriller bit to it!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I was really excited when this movie came out. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt are usually very engaging to watch, but this story also seemed to hold a lot of promise. However, this movie heavily failed to deliver an enjoyable cinematic experience. It's unfortunate, but I felt the director was so consumed with trying to make Joseph Gordon Levitt look and act like Bruce Willis, the rest of the movie fell between the cracks. Hard to watch.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I struggled getting in the story of line of this book.  It's was a good enough read.  It's just not something I would ever read again.  The end had quite a surprise to it though!  It's just not really my reading taste

B0053O8AQE|5.0|The product arrived on time, was packaged well and the product works great. This is one of my favorite shows, it never disappoints!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I find this series to be overrated and if it wasn't so sexually explicit, I don't know it would be so popular.  But everyone was talking about it so I gave it a shot.  I read through them all pretty fast, but it's not a book that I would recommend to my friends and family.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|There is so much that is so great about this entire (special edition) package: the value of two 60+ minutes of music discs for the price of one; some dark, cool artwork that will catch your eye and have it trace its lines and peer into the depths of it's varied blacks, grays, and whites; the big theatrical gothic swoosh of music that punctuates with pounding kerrangs at times and underscores with a feathered light timpani drum with a quiet, distant lounge piano line at others.<br /><br />That is perhaps what really adds to the appeal of this \\"gothic metal\\" release probably; the fact that not every song is striving to bring the listener some ear bludgeoning moment.  The music serves the story of a man reliving his life through some fevered dream.  There are slow, almost jazz lounge tracks such as \\"Slow, Love, Slow\\" or heavy thrumming guitar ripped tracks such as on \\"Rest Calm\\".  But no track is ever as simple as that one note description; on the heavy guitar oriented \\"I Want My Tears Back\\" there is a cool, uilleann pipes sounding Irish line of music that is followed and it fits nicely and with fascination into this pounding track that is sure to be a metalhead's favorite song off of the album (the song even has handclaps that you won't mind!).  In fact, when one looks at the credits of the album, one finds that many musicians aside from the band are used to fill out this orchestral work.  One of my favorite songs is the moving \\"The Crow, the Owl and the Dove\\" that begins out with slow clear acoustic steelstring guitar plaintively played and a male vocal that is soon paired with lead vocalist Anette Olzon.  While Olzon does the majority of the vocal work on the album, and a fine job at that coming from someone who isn't into female vocals generally, there are choral approaches and a couple of male lead vocals throughout the 13 songs.  The blending of male and female vocals is often very satisfying and it is on this song that builds up the music to a slow but powerful stir before finally fading out on a piano line.  Then, for musical spice, listen to \\"Arabesque\\" and if you close your eyes you might just envision pictures of Sinbad running through a bazaar with scimitar in hand chasing some evil magician foe!  The music is really diverse throughout and I have come to appreciate it the more that I listen to it.<br /><br />I'd be remiss in not discussing the second disc of this special edition.  It is the instrumental version of the album and it really helps the listener appreciate the nuances of the music.  In truth listening to this album isn't like going to some rock concert; it is like going to a center for the arts and sitting down wiht a lot of people dressed up in tuxedos and evening gowns as an orchestra fronted by a theatrical rock band plays a sweeping, wide ranging concerto full of blister and power chords, spaces full of rush and swoon.  This is some simply exciting and really well done music.<br /><br />So there you have all of the praise for the album.  But what of its defects?  Ah, well, the storyline is hard to follow and the music at times can overreach in the sense that it doesn't quite work in the flow at times (take the lengthy opus \\"Song of Myself\\" which captures the penultimate realization of our protagonist through four movements that vary in musical style--the song works and is a piece of grandeur but there are times within the song that it really feels like a few different songs stitched together--a minor complaint to be sure in the scheme of the album).stir before finally fading out on a piano line.

B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I just saw The Impossible at the movies today. This film hasn't received the prestige treatment that others have in a year that has seen exceptional films, but it should have.<br />The movie starts with a family visiting a resort off the coast of Thailand during the Christmas holiday of 2004. The mother, father, and three sons seem unremarkable on the face of it. They are just nice though the viewer really never is given much insight into their lives prior to their vacation or the events that have preceded the day after Christmas. On December 26, 2004 the family is kicking back around the resort's pool after their Christmas celebration the night before.<br />In a moment that seems as unremarkable as the family itself, the ordinary is replaced by the surge of a wall of water guaranteed to horrify. A tsunami rushes in and destroys everything and everyone in a flash. As the family struggles against the surge they are separated. Thus begins a story of profound loss, survival, uncertainty, and lives that will inevitably impacted and changed forever. In the process there are gestures of sympathy and kindness, both large and small in their simplicity that echo the inherent goodness in people regardless of their age or position in life. As the family struggles to reunite with great uncertainty of what lies ahead, the viewer gets involved not only with the disaster and its inevitable horror but also with the human struggle to survive and also deal with loss.<br />I expected this to be a rough movie to watch. When this event occurred I was transfixed and depressed by what I saw on TV and knew what would follow. As this film played out, what surprised me was the there was an upside to the tragedy which was portrayed. The struggle to survive and the kindness of complete strangers was life affirming and spiritually uplifting. For me, using the device of a family in peril removed this from the category of disaster story to a human story that spoke for both the victims and the survivors of an unparalleled disaster in current times.<br />The special effects were very realistic. The photography as well as the pacing of this movie were just right. The acting in this movie was great. Naomi Watts was nominated for an Academy Award for a powerful performance as the mother Maria, but there were many fine performances in this movie. Ewan McGregor as Henry her husband and Tom Holland as the son Lucas who Maria struggles to save, contribute to elevating this story on a dramatic level. In fact, Tom Holland was absolutely remarkable.<br />This was a beautifully done film and one which will stay with me for a long time.vivors of an unparalleled disaster in current times.<br />The special effects were very realistic.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought this backpack with the intention of using it for traveling. So far so good. It fits my 17 inch notebook with no problem!<br />I read previous reviews that this backpack may or may not fit 17in notebooks but in my opinion ith fits it well. It also has excellent padding for my notebook. This back pack also has plenty of other compartments for storing some clothes as well with plenty of room. The price is very good as compared to prices out there on the market.<br />I recommend this backpack for anyone who wants to protect their notebook and have plenty of room for other things.

B003O86FMW|3.0|I surprised myself reading this series at all and then surprised myself even more by liking the entire series. The books are definitely not for everyone but if you enjoyed the Hunger Games you need to follow the mad twists that the president has in store.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It was $4.99.  I had just played Cursed Onboard and it was aweful! After spending $2.99 on that one, I was a bit leary to buy another.  It was so much better than some other games.  Only took a couple hours to get through.  Obviously, I choose to spend $ on the games, so this one was worth it.  Story was good and graphics were fantastic! Thanks G5 for this one because after that crappy last game, I almost didn't buy it and will continue with your games.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Even though I rated this at five stars, and despite the impressive acting and awesome costumes, there are some flaws to this series.  In broad terms it is historically accurate, but there are some radical departures from historical fact, such as Henry's sister Margaret marrying the king of Portugal.  It just never happened.  Actually, we have managed to watch pnly fie of the fifteen discs thus far, but are very impressed with what we have seen (aside from some historically inaccurate fancies; wolsey's death is another bit of theatrical license).  Be prepared for some long viewing sessions.
1400067820|5.0|I had read Taleb's Black Swan so pretty well knew how he thinks and writes. whatever he writes is worth reading for curious minds. Antifragile  will keep you fascinated. the author is well in a position to hold forth on subjects most of us seldom consider, either when we vote, invest, or buy things. he has a personal success history that validates his writing.

B004A8ZX28|5.0|Another good movie starring Liam Neeson, although not all reviews agree.  A somewhat bizarre plot, but lots of action, and in the end, the &#34;good guy&#34; (or is he) ends up coming out OK.  This is probably the kind of movie you either like a lot or feel was a waste of time and money.  I liked it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This app worked great the first time I played it. Since then it will not open on my kindle fire. Very disappointing...I did not have this problem with the original version.

B00846F1YW|4.0|I really like the different puzzles mixed in and that they revolvenaround a decent story line. looking now for more by this developer.
0790729407|4.0|I personally enjoyed this story of Michael Collins and thought it fairly accurate historically, although friends of mine in Ireland thought that there was a bit of blarney involved.  For anyone interested in the Irish civil war, and the earlier IRA campaign against the British, I thhink it gives a fairly accurate basic grounding.  Liam Neeson, as always, shines.  It is somewhat ironic that Needon himself is from Northern Ireland, playing the Republic's greatest iconic hero.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|RACIST JOKES ABOUT NATIVES, WAY TO SCARY FOR SMALL CHILDREN. MY KIDS HATED IT.

IN VERY BAD TASTE. THERE WERE A FEW FUNNY SCENES BUT, THIS SHOULD REALLY NOT BE MARKETED TO CHILDREN.

B005PK56TA|4.0|This was a freebee with Amazon Prime. I was apprehensive to watch it at first.  I like weird, scary shows but didn't want to scare myself so much that I'd think about it at night while trying to sleep.  I didn't do that thank goodness.  It does have a good story line within the &#34;horrors&#34;. The ending got a little redundant but overall it is a good watch.  I read the next season is totally different and about Jessica Lange's character. I may actually pay to watch the second season.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game, but it probably needs more things to die from in the game. If l have counted right, the number of thing to die from is maybe about 6. So make sure to do that on an update, ok?
B0041KOVNW|4.0|This album was recommended to me by Jon Schaffer of Iced Earth.  It is very original, and worth checking out.  It reminds me a little of Blue Oyster Cult in some ways.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is not my kind of game, but the Grandchildren like it.  That's all that matters, right?<br />Good game for them.
B000MAOLVW|5.0|The picture combines actual Grand Prix footage with the Hollywood staged racing shots. Even these were filmed on the actual Grand Prix track locations. You will never see a greater Formula 1 racing movie. Be sure to watch the extras provided with the movie as these will help you enjoy the action even more. The cast actually had to learn to drive (well some of them) before the filming began. Good script and excellent players (including cameos of racing greats of the era), but the cars are the stars. You won't see racing like this again; before seat belts and all the safety features installed today. This is a wonderful evening's entertain-ment and shouldn't be missed.
B000E6EH1S|5.0|I just started getting into orchestral music in 2012.  I have been obsessed with music since I was a little kid.  I am looking for a solid 2-channel audio, high-fidelity sonic experience.  I have a Yamaha 1000w 7.1 receiver, Monitor Audio speakers and a Bowers & Wilkins subwoofer.  The receiver has a \\"direct\\" mode, in which it shuts off the surround speakers and all sound processing for flat, stereo sound reproduction (when I watch a DVD, I always search the \\"setup/ language\\" section for the 2-channel \\"stereo\\" option).  I opted for the Davis/ Amsterdam version of Symphonie Fantastique, since it is considered to be the definitive performance of this piece, and Amsterdam is said to be the #1 orchestra in the world.  I have the speakers turned 30 degrees inward to form an equilateral triangle within the room (I researched this and tested it on numerous 2-channel systems, and it works; if you are curious about this, feel free to post a question under \\"comments\\".)  When I close my eyes, I can see where each musician is sitting, and I can see the looks on their faces (hyperbole much?) as they are playing their instruments.  I am really satisfied with this CD, and it will be on regular rotation in my CD player for quite some time.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, and definitely appreciate the job done.  The videography was spectacular, and the actors were the best.  It just seems to me there was something hinky about the villian that makes him less believable.  Maybe that's what they wanted, but he is the only reason this movie did not get a 5.  The dude just wasn't believeable in the context of the story.  Can't quite put a precise analysis on it, but overall it is entertaining, and Daniel Craig is the kind of kickass actor to play Bond since Connery.  Buy it if you have the cash and like James Bond films!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|If you like learning about history in an entertaining manner, Follett does this very well.  I can't wait to read the next book in this trilogy.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Great episode but despite having a GREAT connection it played jumpy and didn't buffer. Really not great quality. Will think twice before purchasing and streaming from Amazon in the future.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved the actors, the characters, the scenery, the story and the message. The whole shebang!<br />Definitely worth the watch!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A solid book that entertains and makes your imagination work.  I wish a few points were explained a little better but I know this isn't the hard-core sci-fi read that takes you though the math and science of how everything works.  What is really great is that for the most part this is a good window into what is possible for mankind's future.  Worth every penny.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|When your eager to pick the book up again an wish it had not ended when your finished... that's a good book. At first I was unsure as I rarely read this type of fiction but was soon drawn into the story because of the authors ability to make the imagination come alive. The book exceeded my expectation.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This book was a life changer for me as I struggled in a disfunctional workplace. It provided the skills I needed to gain respect and be able to work at my desired level of productivity. I highly recommend it for anyone who must work and live with others.
B005HSL626|5.0|very addicting  don't want to add more words  I don't want to be told to type so many words thank u
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well written in an entertaining way that really lets you into the mind of someone in a dire situation who never loses his sense of what a awful time he's having.  Not often do I literally laugh out loud (actually out loud not when someone says &#34;oh, L-O-L&#34; and you're supposed to know they think what you've said is funny even though they didn't laugh) while reading a book, but I really did.  This book is quite interesting and I think it would entertain most readers - not just sci-fi oriented folks.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a must read for anyone that calls themselves American!  Chris Kyle is a true hero at a time when there are damn few who could carry that torch.  The hell he went thru only to come home and be shot to death by someone he was trying to help is hard to grasp.  Realy makes you stop and think what's important in life.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|the number of digital options besides uv was nice. the blue ray and quality of the series speak for themselves.
B000000WFU|4.0|Adiemus is a haunting composition brilliantly realised on CD. I heard it on radio in the late 1990s when it was released and it took me until a month ago to track it down. I particularly like the lyrics being &#34;non-language&#34;, a bit like scat singing for a classically trained singer. I was worried that the rest of the album would not measure up to the standard set by the first and most popular track. I needn't have worried!
B0000549B0|5.0|A great movie with wonderful actors, entertainment for any age young or older .  James Steward keep you smiling through the whole movie. He makes you think there is really a Harvey.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|A very good selection of songs, some of which Mr. Groban wrote himself.  His voice is flawless, and beautiful.  I highly recommend this CD to all Josh Groban fans.
B004H1U2HE|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone interested in a good story about a Jewish family and how they came to live in Isreal and make it their own. The characters become alive in your mind and their stories gripping.
B00009TB5G|4.0|It's all here. The movie, extended with all the extra scenes, and a wealth of behind the scenes information for the LOTA enthusiast.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great quality, sound is crisp and clear.  Picture quality is great.  The U.K. version is the the one to buy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far the best yet, Sparks has out done his self. His description of spousal abuse, and the abuser was a form of perfection.
B002VPDOFK|5.0|Went to New York for work in 2011, I was driving through Mid-Town and the song \\"Empire State of Mind\\" came on the radio, afterwards the \\"DJ\\" came on and said we play the songs \\"NEW YORKERS LOVE\\"! It was just one of those moments! So I got the CD and revisited as a vacation summer 2012 and the CD played flawless :)
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|My 7yr old nephew plays this game. And he loves it. Thanks for bringing back a classic I knew as a teenager!
B006A819AG|5.0|This is another hit from The Roots.  I listen to this and HIGO on a continuous loop at work almost daily. The production quality is great and up to par with the rest of their very great albums.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the story. I plan to follow up with more Sylvia day books. I hope there is more to this story.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|They get you hooked with a free trial, and then you just have to pay the 5 bucks so you can keep playing. Cheaper than going to the movies, and longer lasting entertainment. ;)
B00001SIES|5.0|Muse was great. They were amazing. This album is evidence of an era in their music now since passed, when they acknowledged the finer points and notes of life and song.
068484267X|5.0|It will be one of my all-time favorites!  The characters were well developed---I truly felt like I knew them and wanted to help them.  The story line progressed into the finale leaving my cheeks wet from tears.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is just so wonderful. This is a mixed-emotions book. This book really was great. You must read this book.<br /><br />  Everyone should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcome the world.<br />  -Auggie Pullman
020530902X|3.0|This book was bent up but the inside quality was great. The book is interesting and holds my attention. We haven't used it for class much but it is and interesting read.
B004CAWKXE|5.0|MCR will always have a place in my heart, fellow killjoys. The fanfiction entries on the website can be a tearjerker with the album, they make a hellva story you should check out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the best apps ever made. It is very fun to play for all ages. It Is kind of like temple run but I guess a little more fun. You can jump on top of subways and are trying to avoid a cop. There are jet packs,jumpy shoes that make u jump,x2 things that make you go faster and mystery boxes you can open at the end of each round. There are obstacles you have to avoid too. I would recommend this to all ages who are interested in this. Also subway surfers automatically upgrades when they do new destinations. Like now its Sydney Australia and there was New York and Rio De jenero. It's fun!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg , I Love this game is so fun especially on road trips when your really bored just play subway surfers. It's very entertaining . You should really play it. It's addictive!!!!!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Love this show. Acting is solid, plot is good and it keeps the viewer engaged. Similar to batman, except hes more liberal in his use of violence...great show
B0095P29EG|5.0|I loved this movie and my husband enjoyed it too. Testosterone, action, betrayal, humor and love...can't wait for another one!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play it everyday. Easy to use. I like the undo feature. If you like solitare you will love this game.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the best series I've ever read. E L James does a fabulous job writing this series. Love this book
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is one of the big forces in blues these days. He is a total shredder when it comes to doing solos. If you are a person who loves guitar solos that aren't just scales then check this one out.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Great movie if you are having a \\"pitty party\\" about getting fired and you are really good at what you do in your career!<br /><br />Good music!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I don't know how to update this my sis plays this but an  updated but I frontline how she did it she uses a phone and I use a tablet kindle fire
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome!!!;) it's fun to play and it's good for all ages! It has to be one of the easiest games ever!
B002S4DO36|5.0|This is a very well done album from the song writing to the playing and also the audio qualities done in the studio. Weather it is on vinyl, CD or even MP3 it is a purchase worth getting if you are a fan of Gov't Mule or Warren Haynes.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|Warner Brothers has tried every trick it can to market this major label debut. Some WB ads hinted this was his first album. Then there was the Hendrix hype. Like any hype from a record label, it is hard to come out from underneath the hype and shine. This album has little to do with Hendrix stylings. It floats from a few searing style guitar tunes to funk to smooth soul. It is nice but is not a landmark album. Go with earlier albums by Clark.
0486284735|5.0|Haven't got time to read it yet, but the book cover looks great and brand new. Happy with the purchase!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it its great my score is 18605042 my cumin said it sickening Annie he loves it its.colorful.I love it
B006R1T40I|5.0|If you are a fan of Bonnie Raitt this is a solid purchase. There is quite a bit of diversity to the music plus her great vocals and guitar work makes it all happen. Audio quality is quite good but not superb.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is. Great game but it annoys me sometimes because say if I turned right it might be to quick so then I the person dies!
1594745692|4.0|The product is amazing. Personally i think the quality of the paper could be better, but for that price I think is OK. It's not a bad material or anything, is just that I imagined a little bit thicker cardboard. Anyways, excellent illustrations and the whole concept is amazing!
B00968THRE|5.0|(Gonna duplicate my Lights post.  Halcyon takes it all more than a step forward!) Ellie's SNL appearance blew me away and I had no idea who she was.  I became intoxicated instantly and she is my guilty obsession.  Being over 40 I mentioned Ellie to my daughter and she knew who she was, and I felt ashamed.  Classifies herself as 'Pop'.  But, not a chance with actual poetry and meaning with feeling and a delivery that is unparalleled.  If pop has to be in the description, I'd say Goth-Pop.  Something in the same realm of a Cyndi Lauper - Evanescence - Florence & the Machine, with this delicate quiver, shyness and force in her voice.  The last music that has me this excited was James.  She won't be able to produce music in the future without me purchasing it.  You will probably see this middle-age man at her concert dragging his daughter there as a 'cover'.
1400067820|5.0|This is the best of all his books! If you never read his books before you gotta start from fooled by randomness. Otherwise this book will bored you with all the terms u have no clues!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have noticed no major problems with the game and it is also very entertaining. I play it almost everyday in my free time.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Don't  seem to bug me all the time and has the right stuff on the screen to help with my questions.  They work 24 hours a day.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|What a great story.  Poignant and funny at the same time.  Interested in seeing the movie.  Definitely recommend looking for a good read.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We never get tired of Giamatti's performance in this, as cerebral (and verbose) as it is.  Laura Linney is incredible, and balances him out.  Love the friendship with Jefferson.<br /><br />INCREDIBLE FILM SERIES.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games tremendously.  The second volume was  a bit &#34;slow&#34;  in getting along, but volume 3 was good.<br />On the whole I'm not keen on futuristic novels, but here it made one once again aware that each person has some sort of talent(s) and in time of necessity it is indeed the mother of invention.  Wellwritten with a good pace.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent reading.Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.Could not stop.Read it from cover to cover.Much better than the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is the best because you get to do a lot of special things I love subway surfers the updates
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Isn't that always the case?  I'd read the book before and was looking forward to this movie. It was very action packed (more so than the book), but some of the scenes were unbelievable (like the train ride). I liked the way they tied history into the movie. Almost makes you believe it could have happened. Either way, it was a very entertaining movie.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This Kindle Fire cover is stylish and functional. I like that it turns the device off when the cover is closed. I am glad I chose this product.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very entertaining and addictive. I can pay all day long non stop. Fun for all ages. If you loved the first one then you will definitely enjoy this one also
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|I loved it. It was like a little supernatural find and puzzle game.  I loved to play it til it stopped me.  It said I could play the same games but if  I want to advance to 96% that is still left I'd have to buy it. I would buy it if it didn't do that to me.  I hate it when they forced you to stop.<br /><br />Above paragraph was written by 13 yr old.<br /><br />Apparently the game is addicting.  She was in the middle of the game when the free period expired, hence her venom.  She described it as being akin to stopping an episode of 'Dr. Who' when a Dalek has a gun to the Doctor's head.  That means it's a game that is doing a great job at sellling itself.<br />(the mom)
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie!  It captured my attention right from the beginning. If you know any alcoholics, you can probably relate to Denzel (aka Whip) and what he was going through, his mindset, etc. I was pulling for him through the whole movie.  Luckily, he got what he wanted.
B00701L5XS|5.0|So now I spend my weekends home learning to tie knots.  Very Zen or very sad?  All I know is it's a bit of fun, and one day it's going to come in handy when I'm the only one who can tie a double half hitch.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I had seen the trailers and read the reviews, so I knew I wanted to watch this movie.  However, I didn't really get to it until Denzel was nominated for an Oscar for his role.<br /><br />I have seen Lincoln and agree that Daniel Day Lewis did an amazing job, but I think Denzel actually does a much better acting job in this film.  His portrayal of the arrogant, miserable, alcoholic pilot is entirely believable and nearly flawless.  The script is great, but I think Denzel did some serious work to get into character and has given us one of his best career performances.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This show is my current favorite.  More about an evolving group of people, thrown together after a virus created &#34;walkers&#34; or the walking dead who are on a constant mission to eat the living.  The walkers aren't the core of the plot for this show though, how this diverse group of people learn to cope and find a way to contribute to the group! EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!  I accidently gave the first season a bad review.  Amazon sent me an email to comment on my last 25-30 purchases.  The comment was meant for the &#34;Retractable Car Charger for the Barnes and Noble Nook.  I wait every week for the next episode.  I wish they could afford to produce 2-3 hour episodes each week!
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|This book I so fun and just really great for kids and it really makes you happy. It is just full of fun.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|This is a very good and enjoyably concise assessment of the impact automation has had and will have on employment.  It includes nineteen good policy recommendations and concludes on an appropriately optimistic note.
0812992784|2.0|I admit that this is the first Rushdie book I have read.  I never was attracted to his novels, especially.  I am about 400 pages into \\"Joseph Anton\\" and am thoroughly bored.  I will stick it out to the end, as I do always, but it will be a hard slog.  With no disrespect to the author, and to the difficult situation of his life for 10 years, I find him insufferably long-winded and totally self-indulgent.  Right off the bat I was put off by Rushdie's use of the third person - not only because it seems pompous, but also since when he brings in other characters (names which swarm all over every page) it becomes confusing as to which \\"he\\" is the person being described - is it Rushdie or the other guy?  The horror of living under the fatwa notwithstanding, Rushdie repeats and repeats himself, ad nauseam, on the subjects of personal and literary freedom, his (supremely failed) marriages and relationships, and the humdrum-ness of his daily existence.  Yes, we get the point - but Rushdie beats this drum incessantly - enough to fill 600 or so pages with lots of word-spinning.  I have the feeling that the fatwa brought undue celebrity to Rushdie, even given the fact that he, earlier, had won the Booker Prize.  I have the feeling that, if it were not for the fatwa, his books would not be so widely read.  I have the feeling that I, for one, fatwa or no fatwa, will not read any more Rushdie.  Approach this long and tedious memoir with caution.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I wouldn't hesitate to urge people to watch this show!  It's awesome and the reason it's awesome is because the plot line is not so much about the \\"walkers\\" as it is about how several diverse groups cope with an apocalyptic world.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|It is rare that I have the time, energy or inclination to read a book in a single sitting. This book has my undivided attention from the start. It was chosen for our book club and I'm so glad. I never would have read a book so oddly named. The details unfolded in such a way that the reader doesn't have a chance to wander aimlessly. It is packed with detail without being statistical and 70 years after the war still manages to make us care about the atrocities that were visited on the people and the land at the hands of those seeking power, while humanizing those that carried out the orders.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|In light of recent world events, this movie highlights how things have to get done when the government is more worried about perception than people.
0374275637|5.0|Those willing to tackle this 400+ page tome are in danger of becoming more humble.  I read the book in 2 weeks, but it took months for me see how much the book helps me understand why people can see the same facts so differently.<br /><br />I like books and articles about how the mind works.  There is the \\"Creative Right-Brain vs. the Logical Left-Brain\\" fad that spawned books about \\"personalities\\". The age of computers led to the idea that brain function during sleep is like a tape recording being re-played for analysis. And, of course, there is the \\"Men are from Mars; Women are from Venus\\" fad.  Some of this stuff is very funny:  [...] .<br /><br />These constructs are interesting and entertaining, but they don't show why we make stupid decisions when, upon rational analysis, we can make better decisions. Over decades of carefully constructed experiments Kahneman and his longtime colleague, Amos Tversky, teased out two distinct ways in which we think - Fast, and Slow. Finally, there is a way to explain why \\"the other tribe\\" thinks the way they do - be it Left/Right wing politics, Religion/Atheism, or Science/Religion.<br /><br />The genius of this book is the way the author presents evidence that, while we believe our rational System 2 is making important decisions, our intuitive System 1 actually runs most of our lives. No hi-tech tools are used; just a series of questions and quizzes and a supply of willing undergraduate subjects.  The book has 5 major sections with about 5 chapters per section.  Each chapter poses and answers a specific question about how we actually think.  No spreadsheets, graphs or equations are used; just a layman's view of the questions and quizzes and what they show.  Some reviewers find this approach repetitious and boring. However, the cumulative effect of this easy-to-read narrative is devastating!  It reveals the far-reaching impact of System 1 cognitive bias on everything:  politics, public policy, the stock market, and even happiness.<br /><br />Finally, I've long felt that being \\"Rational\\" was the only way to go.  This book forced me off the Rational Thought throne.  It turns out that, while I may engage System 2 thinking a little more often than average, I'm just as likely to make System 1 - based bad decisions as the next guy.<br /><br />Humbling indeed!s.<br /><br />Finally, I've long felt that being \\"Rational\\" was the only way to go.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|i loved it almost as good as the second season.  i came in half way through the second series and was hooked right away. so i bought the first season and was not disappointed at all. I can't wait till the third season. It was a great price for all 12 episodes.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I found that i enjoyed this game. The story line was interesting and the art work was well done. Though i did have slight difficulty clicking on the items. I liked it, and if you like item search games i am sure you will like it too.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander III gave me something different to consider about NDE and self consciousness. As a neurosurgeon with no apparent 'axe to grind' about these things, and after checking with physicians who are knowledgeable about these kinds of experiences, I now want to think more deeply about the whole topic of self consciousness and its potential for linking into some sort of global consciousness.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book is so cheap it's worth a dollar for a few hours of entertainment. I passed over this book previously due to the price and experience with other self published Kindle e-books being so poor. I finally decided to get the sample and found the length was long enough to become invested which is not always the case.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of humor and had many laugh out loud moments. It felt like a survival action hollywood story, not much depth but a fun ride.<br /><br />While the ending is abrupt this shouldn't prevent you from checking this out.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for a lover of older movies.  My mother-in-law loved it.  Nice price and now she has the collector edition!

B003JTHXOK|4.0|The story was good, although, the charactars lacked depth to me....  I loved the ending, loved the twist!  I think that's the only thing that saved the story from being another &#34;cliche&#34;  But overall, good story and I would recommend the read!

B009MO5G90|3.0|RE: Retribution is a bitter sweet affair. For the most part you're getting mindless,zombie action,yet at the same time theirs parts of the films plot I felt could have been brilliant if they where explored a little bit more. The whole arch with the little girl added a lot of emotional sci-fi depth to this film,despite her role only really being briefly touched upon.<br />For fans of the game you get to see Barry Burton and Leon Kennedy but don't expect much. You feel no real attachment to either character and other than the looks of the characters theirs nothing very distinguishing about them. No more than pawns to keep the action coming.<br /><br />The 3D here was somewhat of a letdown for me. Maybe it's just because I was expecting so much more?<br />Their are a few great pop out effects,but I felt the 3D was lacking depth and for the most part was a little too flat most of the time.<br /><br />Resident Evil Retribution is as cliche and over the top as every other installment of the series but actually,surprisingly, has some interesting science fiction foundation behind it.
B007JMW46U|5.0|One of many free books to download to my Nexus 7, I'd always enjoyed the movies, educational channel series versions, but its reading the book that gives me the greatest please.  Simply reading and enjoying the published original stories.  Rediscover the classics, they're worth it.
B007REV4YI|3.0|Maybe many folks are not aware of the original Bond movies. They were slick and classy. Bond was beyond cool, seldom missing a step. This latest effort just doesn't pass muster - at least for me. The movie was lackluster, unsurprising, and uninspiring for a Bond movie. The video/audio presentation was great for what it's worth. I Enjoyed the actors as well. Seeing the old Maserati gave me a brief spine tingle. But, honestly, it was the thinness of the story itself and the framing of the Bond character that weakened the overall experience. Nothing ground breaking here, and seeing Bond as a nearly washed up flunky absolutely doesn't cut it for me. Athletes on steriods, Batman drawn down, and now, our hero less world is presented with a defective James Bond(Have you happened to notice how movies these days don't have uplifting or positive themes, but are so often grim and dark instead?). It's sad to have to write a negative review of a 007 movie when I think about the wonderful historical legacy of these movies, but what can I do? Gotta be truthful about what I saw. I won't go on belaboring what may have already said here with regard to Skyfall. I just really hope that whoever is at the controls in movie land does a better job next time whenever that time comes. Worthy of a rent if you have some time to sacrifice.

B0073U2F12|3.0|The Darkest Hour is your standard alien invasion fair we've become accustomed to seeing. Aliens descend to earth and we go along with the survivors as they deal with the threat.<br />The first third of the movie is great,as well as the final act. I think what holds this film back is the middle mark which is mostly filler that might draw a few yawns.<br />For some reason The Darkest Hour seems to have this strange combination of placing a Final Destination cast with what almost (I dare say) looks like Ghostbuster technology,but it works very well. The Russian landscape is great for this type of film and it really shines in 3D. Which leads me to the next point.............<br /><br />The 3D here is pretty solid. Theirs only one really good &#34;pop&#34; out effect but the 3D depth is fantastic and really adds to the experience here. If you have the chance to watch The Darkest Hour in 3D I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Another great thing about this Bluray is the added special feature, entitled &#34;Survivors&#34; which shows us the worldwide impact of the alien invasion. The Japanese are broadcasting how to defeat the alien threat and we are also shown  US soldiers fighting alongside Taliban resistance in Afghanistan against the off world threat. That's pretty neat if you ask me. The Survivors feature last about 10 minutes in total but adds quiet a bit to the depth of the main film.<br /><br />In conclusion The Darkest Hour is nothing special,but it's a decent ride with a good cast. It's worth a rental and worth keeping around in a 3D library.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game pulls you in then gets boring after about ten games I would not reccomrnd this game to the impatient I just uninstalled it
B004LWZW6U|3.0|Piranha 3DD pulls no punches in what it is. Campy,horror fun.<br />The Piranha's are back and this time their invading an adult triple X themed water park leaving no cleavage unscathed in their path.<br />That alone is enough to raise an eyebrow or two but this movie is surprisingly good for what it is.<br />It never over steps its boundaries and stretches itself thin. It's fun,fast,and manages a few tense moments as well.<br />The cast is great as well,which features  appearances from David hasselhoff,Gary Busey, and Christopher Lloyd.<br /><br />The 3D presentation isn't bad either. I'll put it this way, If you want to see girls in Bikinis in 3D (getting eaten by blood thirsty Piranha's no less), this will probably be worth your investment.<br />Theirs quiet a bit of depth to the films 3D,though a few pop out scenes fall short of expectation with only maybe one or two really grabbing out at you,and even then they leave a bit to be desired.<br />Piranha 3DD is certainly worth a rental and bluray, and for the price is worth keeping around in your 3D collection. It certainly adds that extra dimension to the film that really helps emerse you in the whole experience.

B005LAII80|4.0|I would say Dredd was without a doubt the sleeper hit of 2012.<br />The story in this film is tight,visceral,and peppered with gore,yet as you'll see it's all just another day at the office for Dredd. Which is what makes his character so cold,interesting,and even a little bit frightening.<br /><br />The 3D in Dredd is good and does  what every 3D movie should accomplish. Emerse you into the film. Thus Dredd just doesn't become a movie that relies on it's 3D,but rather uses it as a solid supplement which strongly adds to the experience. I would without a doubt recommend watching this in 3D for anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome and this is my first minecraft game ever if you think this stinks you should just not play Endymion video games and mod and sop to your lonely self

B004YOEFG8|4.0|Hubble 3D follows several astronauts as they launch into space to repair the Hubble telescope. The documentary itself is pretty good but where it really pays off is in the final part of the film.<br />They take the Hubble's images,render them into 3D,then take you the viewer through a tour of our universe as far back as we can possibly go through the cosmos to the primordial beginnings of ancient galaxies that barely resemble our own,and yes, it's as awesome as it sounds.<br />Honestly,it's pretty cool to watch what the astronauts go through preparing for a trip into space but this film could have been the final part all the way through and I think it would have packed a better punch.<br />Sometimes instead of telling us about something it's simply better just to show us,and I feel this is where Hubble 3D fell a little short.<br />I think a Hubble exploration 3D bluray would hit the sweet spot a little better,but still, this Imax movie all around is a great one to watch and to add to your collection.<br /><br />On a side note. I purchased this movie at my local Best Buy for 19.95. Way less than the 30 dollar price tag brand new on Amazon. That's even cheaper than the used versions as well.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This was a great series and kept me from what I should have been doing so I could watch another episode
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book has so many things going for it. It has a love story, along with action and wondering what will happen next!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter's started playing this game and hot me hooked!!  Now we challenge each other! It's so much fun! Completely addicting!
B008NEMPTO|3.0|This is one of those movies that doesn't get everything wrong but certainly doesn't do it all right either.<br />I felt the first half moved so fast you didn't feel compelled by the story,yet had it moved slower I don't think it would have helped either.<br />The second act of the film is where it starts to shine and the ending is powerfully touching. The second half alone feels like a different beast all together and that's what makes this movie such and interesting enigma and a tough one to properly review.<br />The action for the most part is mindless, but still manages a few briefly clever moments. Though the vampires look great you're never in the least bit scared by them,and thus you start to see why this whole movie is a give and take affair. Where one aspect is nailed perfectly something else is deeply lacking. The main antagonist,Adam (played by Rufus Sewell) is pretty boring without anything compelling going for his character,yet his vampire maiden Vadoma,(played by Erin Wasson) is great.<br />Lincoln is uninspired as a youth,but as the character ages so does your emotional attachment to him.<br /><br />The 3D adds very little to the experience here. No good pop out effects can be found and theirs quiet a bit missing here if you're looking for 3D depth.<br />In conclusion,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter has some very redeeming qualities but only the most patient of movie goers will last long enough to find them. 3 stars.
1843106698|4.0|If you or someone you care about has Aspergers this is a great place to start reading.  The book isnt alwsys spot on but in the authors defense it isn't called a spectrum disorder for nothing.  There is a wide range of personalties dealing with Aspergers.  Also know that if you are reeling with a new diagnosis in the family that everything will be fine as long as you care.  My son is third generation Aspie and we are all doing pretty well and living full lives.  Educate yourself advocate do not hesitate to give your Aspie whst you know they need.  They are not being difficult or different on purpose.  Their brain is wired different from a neorotypical like my daughter.  Its the first time Ive gotten to be up close to someone born with social skills. Amazing and mind blowing but social skills can still be taught.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|First, fruit ninja. And now this! Jetpack Joyride has awesome gameplay, great graphics, and a feeling that leaves you wanting more. I really loved the new addition of gadgets, especially Flash.  Now if only you would put Monster Dash and Age of Zombies on for the Kindle.  IOS and Android have too many great games if you ask me.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I found the movie entertaining, but the plot could have been better.  would not watch again........  .... .... .... ...
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Thor is a great super hero movie. Though it's certainly just a piece of the puzzle building up to the Avengers film,it really stands on it's own and that's a great thing if you're expecting a lot out of it's 3D version.<br /><br />The opening menu looks spectacular in 3D and really amps up your expectations for the whole film to come. Sadly,the film offers less 3D depth than I expected and theirs really no pop out factor to speak of. The best way I can describe the 3D look of this film is bubbly. That probably makes very little sense but if you watch it you'll know what I mean. It doesn't look terrible in it's 3D presentation but it's nothing to gawk over either.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great 3D super hero film I say go for the Avengers. It's only a few dollars more than Thor (3D versions). Shoot their are plenty of 3D films much cheaper that look better in 3D.<br />I only recommend Thor (3D version) to the hardcore fanbase,or for those who collect 3D movies and just want to watch everything in 3D (like myself).For everyone else the standard bluray or DVD version will be satisfying enough. It's a great,entertaining movie,with subpar 3D.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|I chose this book for a beach vacation &#34;read&#34;. Not a good choice. It certainly was technically accurate portraying the horror associated with the 2nd World War, but very depressing. Then again war is awful, I should have reconsidered my choice.
B009GLHF5C|5.0|After seeing the concert in Seattle in Los Angeles, I wish I had purchased the album before seeing the shows.  The first 10 times I listened to it, I didn't get past the first three tracks (Supremacy, Madness, and Panic Station).  Muse continues to put out quality music without getting stale or recycling old songs and sounds.  Amazing.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|at first i thought it might be a childish game but as the levels go higher it does get harder its a really cute game im glad i got it
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|If I am going to pick one thing to rave about in this movie it's Gordon-Levitt.  He matched his facial expressions,mannerisms and voice inflection to Bruce Willis so closely that I was (once again) blown away by his talent.  The story is alright, the supporting cast is decent.  Not amazing sci-fi, even though the concept was decent, the application was lacking.  I'm not mad that I watched it, so there's that.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|It is a short read. There is a lot of material in this tiny book. So much that each topic only has one paragraph. If the author elaborated more on each topic then I could give it more stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome but there needs to be turns kinds like temple run and we need to be able to jump on trains at any time we want and y'all need to lowern the price on the game and make it a little bit easier for 3 years old cause it a bit to hard for other  people
B000JO9Y6I|5.0|After hearing my entire family rave about this show i went and downloaded all 7 seasons. I am glad i i because I LOVE IT!! Worth watching and give it 10 stars. Finished all 7 seasons in a week and now i have to wait util July for season 8!!

B003VR5PPY|5.0|It's got splendid tension, music, characters... It's all around thrilling. A romp in the mystery genre with a crazy amount of information to absorb. If you aren't a fan of Japanese styled artwork it may not suit you, however.

B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This was a surprise, and a good one at that.  Funny, sweet and poignant.  The movie never took itself to seriously, which let the message come through.
B004JHYRP4|4.0|Hi have come to expect great philosophical novels and stories from Asimov. This however, does not live Upto the promise or the premise. Much better ending could have been achieved. Towards the end, it seemed that Asimov had got bored writing and was in a hurry to wrap up. And the linkage to the title is something which I would be happy to learn from more evolved readers as it escaped me. Not Upto his usual standard towards the last part.<br />However, for persons who think that new technologies bring nothing but harm, this could be a fitting repose.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I was very disappointed when I logged into the app on my kindle fire and all of the games/ points associated with my account did not transfer from playing on my android smart phone. I really wanted to utilize the much bigger screen!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|As always this is was a great 007 movie.  Love the storyline and the actors.  Looking forward to the next
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I thought going in that Jessica Biel would be the weakest link in this movie and as it turns out, she was the least annoying thing about it.  The story already existed, a previous movie structure already existed and yet - complete failure.  The ending is the laziest piece of work I've encountered in ages.  Blah!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is a great show. It has mystery, adventure and sci fi mixed together. The show was a bit confusing at first but stick with it, everything falls into place after about 4-5 episode. You start to understand the &#34;Troubles&#34; and fall in love with the three main characters. I am glad I rented the season's one at a time so I got to watch them right in a row which helped the understanding more easily. It really is a great show and I hope it continues!
B006I1OB0U|5.0|don't buy this if you buy the uk versions.  it is included in the season dvd.  I absolutely love this series!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this trilogy!!! So sensual and stimulating....couldn't put it down!!!!! If only Christian Gray were real!!! I can't wait to see the movie version.
0593065700|5.0|The book was high octane adventure.  There were twists and turns to keep you guessing as to the outcome.  I liked it very much.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the different constructions that come up with each game.  The graphics are great.<br />Just find the adds frustrating before each game.  Would like a bigger X on the adds.
B004SI118U|3.0|I do love Kate Morton's novels, but this one moved a little slower.  It took me till 2/3's to really not want to put it down.  In a way it reminded me of the tv series Downton Abbey.  I was watching it at the same time -- so it was hard to keep the characters separate.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|OMG...finally...the real Stephen King is back.  It's been a long time since one of his books held me inthrall...I was actually saddened to see the end come.  Wow!  Loved it!
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|One of the best game soundtracks I've heard. Every song from each boss battle in the game is included! It's like I'm reliving those battles when I hear these songs!
B008Y6SGC6|4.0|Good movie with a good message.  I liked how the movie has comedic moments and then jolts you back into the seriousness of the situation.  Sandra Bullock is great!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game.  It never crashes.  The game is fun, but also very addictive.  Playing it right now at midnight even though I should be going to bed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app. I can't wait to get more gems. The graphics are great. It makes me want a real horse this app is awesome
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was so good. I haven't seen the movie yet but watched the trailer and it seems different from the book. Will probably watch anyway, but sure it won't be any where near as good as this book was. Read it!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Although disappointed in the demise of Sean Bean's character Eddard Stark, the series still holds a lot of promise because of the rich storytelling, acting, directing, special effects, sets and scenery,  and music.  The second season is well worth owning if you want to see more of the saga from the first season.  If you are new to the series or haven't seen the first season in awhile I suggest you see the first season first.  I watched this straight through after year since viewing the first season and found myself wishing I had went back and watched the first season before starting.  This is complex story with pieces and moves like a chess game, but of course even the best layed moves can be foiled by outside forces.  The addition of magic, undead, and dragons adds to the tapestry it weaves.  If you enjoy complex dramas with some medieval fantasy you will probably like it.<br /><br />CA Luster
0596522347|2.0|There are some great ideas in the book but it seems like it was developed by a committee where people wanted everything including the kitchen sink in it.<br /><br />I find it hard to be really useful because I do not have the time to wade through all the fluff.  The book is big and heavy because of the thick pages and the glossy pictures.<br /><br />I wish it had focused on the information and not the appearance.  I did not want a &#34;coffee table book&#34;.  Ugh.
B006Y9DY8Q|3.0|I give this movie some credit for the speed effects of the cars.... lots of &#34;boosters&#34; nitro, etc..  that seem to keep giving the cars more power to get  edge.  The characters are typical modern cartoon, very intense and somewhat evil at times.  If you like the modern cartoon thing this will appeal to you.
B00A83075M|3.0|Ever wonder what the characters in video games really want from life? For one thing, the bad guys don't always want to be bad guys - like Ralph.

B007REV4YI|4.0|A harkening back to the old style Bond days like &#34;Dr. No&#34; and &#34;From Russia With Love&#34; without all the gadgetry.  It is quite visceral with an edgier tone that does not detract.  As usual the acting, directing, story, locations, music, and effects are first rate.  An older Bond must use trickery at his old estate to outwit the bad men this time.  Unfortunately men and women are mortal and a key player may pay the ultimate price.  But not to worry, MI-6 will go on.<br /><br />CA Luster

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The first season was very interesting and inspired me to buy the following Castle seasons. I strongly recommend the Castle series.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|If you've read the blurb and any of the other reviews then you'll already know that this is a story about the Weissensteiner family and their troubled journey through the Second World War. I'm not usually drawn to stories like this because I think I have a pretty good idea what's going to happen. A Jewish family, Hitler's revolting regime and the horrors of the Holocaust can only have one dire outcome. It's a bit like watching a film about the Titanic - you know the ship's going to sink so why put yourself through it. I was so wrong to make this assumption. It seems paradoxical that a book chronicling hatred, fear, loss and death can be uplifting, but The Luck of the Weissensteiners left me on a high. This is a story about the best human qualities: love, generosity, trust, faith and hope. Christoph Fischer has brilliantly combined emotive fiction with detailed, historical facts to create a powerful and engrossing story. Although I finished reading it five days ago I'm still affected by its message and still charmed by many of its characters. I work regular nightshifts and my sleep is precious, but this book often kept me up well past my bedtime.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|It pays to look through for similar movies in Amazon.  I ran across this doing a similar search.  An excellent story with a great cast.  A young man goes to visit his grandmother (Maggie Smith) that lives on an estate in the country.  It is near the end of World War II and his mother must find work in London and his father is Missing in Action (MIA).  During his stay he sees a young girl ghost and then finds he can travel between her time and his own.  As he learns about her life he tries to deal with the possibility his father may not return.  Fans of Downton Abbey may like this British drama.  If you enjoy any good drama or ghost stories you will probably find this one well worth your time.  After renting it I immediately purchased it.<br /><br />CA Luster
B004SIIBGU|2.0|When I made a bid on an item it showed in red that I had been outbid even though I was the only bidder at that time. So I put down my Kindle HD 7 and logged onto my desktop and the Browser showed correctly that I was the high bidder. I cannot trust this app.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I found this fourth season of Castle very entertaining, and look forward to more of Castle episodes. I strongly recommend this fourth season.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Not far into it yet, but I am loving the creepy crazy story line! Not for young ones, or people that don't like odd things :-)
B008N1LL42|5.0|Took me awhile to connect the dots that Hasbro was the one that distributed the game I use to play, and hence decided to come up with a movie with the same name.  Although not really much connection other than the name and alien weapons that looked similar to the pegs in the classic version.  The movie stands on its own legs as an action packed drama that measures up to most movies of this genre.  I think they did an excellent job with casting, acting, directing, locations, editing, special effects, camera work, music, and all the rest.  They left it open to a sequel if you watch the credits to the end. If you enjoy movies like [[ASIN:B000I9UA30 Independence Day]] you should love it.  I bought this based on all the positive reviews and I am glad I did.  This is not just a movie for the guys, but many ladies will find it entertaining as well.  The use of retired and disabled military was a nice touch.<br /><br />CA Luster

B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoyed the finding of articles but did not like having to buy more things. I would rather buy a CD and plays as long as I want.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|After you read the other reviews telling you the whole story plot:<br />This story was very interesting (because it is a true escape story), acting was great (Ben Affleck was spot on), but I did not appreciate the hyping of the drama; that is, adding in material to make the story more exciting.  The final chase sceen was a let down as it clearly did not happen and it was like I was watching a Bond movie -- not what I want to see in a documentary.<br />Overall, entertaining; never took my eyes off it till the very end.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|one of the best takes on the comic book hero lines .Well done on the parts and casting since smallville
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I've had both the blu ray and the dvd copies of the complete series and there honestly isn't much difference in the two. You will notice how pathetic the menu is on the dvd copies though. This is one of the best tv series to ever come out though so don't miss out.

B002IC10Y8|5.0|I have been a fan of Yo Yo Ma ever since I first saw his first CD.  This boxed set is worthy of his talent and for the contributions he has made to the appreciation of classical music.<br />What a music ambassador he is!  I have seen him perform live twice.  I cried for joy both times.  He brings his love of music and of people to all his performances.  He embraces the audience and most of all to his fellow musicians who are playing with him.<br />The book that comes with the set is worth the price too.  Filled with gorgeous photos and great descriptions of all the cd's, it is a wonderful source of information.  I would have liked a few more biographical information about his youth and how he matured into the wonderful cellist that he is.  Only a few childhood pictures of him, none of his parents and only one with his older sister.  This is only a small critique.  Bravo 30 years outside the box!

B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book not only inspired me to minimize, but also gave a lot of good ideas for how to do so.
0345529057|5.0|Why read the A Song of Ice and Fire series? First of all this is one of my favorite book series of all time. George RR Martin creates a world full of complex unique characters. Every character in this series, major or minor is unlike any of the others. Each character is driven by his or her human impulses and desires; this makes for a book that's relatable to the common audience. Martin makes his characters vulnerable to death. Where many authors have characters that dodge death, Martin makes characters that die when they get in too much trouble.<br />The conflicts in these books come in many forms. There is the standard conflict, such as the Starks and the Lannisters, where they are physically fighting each other. There are also other more complex conflicts, such as Tyrion and Cersei, whose conflict is based on threats and distrust more than the standard fighting. George RR Martin also doesn't write in terms of good and evil; he writes so you have to decide who is good and bad. Martin's books are also very long which can be good or bad depending on the reader. The story's chapters rotate from different characters prospective. The chapters are usually on of the following characters: Bran, Arya, Jon, Eddard, Danerys, Catelyn, Sansa, Theon, Cersei, Tyrion, Jaime, Briene, Victarion, Euron, Samuel or Davos. Each chapter moves forward each character personal journey or conflict, but also contributes to the overall plot of the book. All in all this book series is a great read; I highly recommend it to an experienced fantasy reader.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I like Testments new album its ol school trash metal at its finest. I grew up listening to these guys as a teenager, it brings back alot of memories.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|This product gives all the signs of being counterfeit.  The box has upside down print in spots.  The inside booklets have poor spelling, duplicated pages, and off colored photos.  Under the bar code, in very very tiny print is the video game symbol E (for everyone) BUT this time it says 'exempt from classification'!! Buyer beware!! Seller (atozmarketplace) has been notified and at the time of this review, we are awaiting a response from them.  Update to follow.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|More levels...I Like this game. It is hours of entertainment. Levels and levels. Better than I expected it to be
B006IYG5HE|3.0|I've just finished and am scratching my head: did I love this book? The story reveals itself slowly or rather the several meandering story lines weave together slowly. Each was fascinating and seemingly unrelated until the end of the book. Which kept me guessing until the end.  I really appreciated the historical accounts and was impressed with the literary and biblical metaphors.  Yeah I guess I really did like it, but just can't believe what happened and am perhaps still a bit confused by the motive. And Harry still has mysteries to solve...maybe there will be a sequel :)
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I loved the first season of GOTs! The second season just arrived but I can't watch it til after my certification exam in April. I can't stand it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  It is well written, weaves a good story with a degree of suspense regarding why Pat is the say he is.  It certainly handles the mental health issues with dignity and some humor.  I think it is &#34;better&#34; than the movie with the character development.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|What is there to say its been around for Yonks and it works well,  otherwise ime sure it would have been long gone...
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner! I couldn't stop reading! You have to know what's going to happen or what that bad girl did!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the first review of the product but I just had to say something. I've bought other Logitech products in the past,and have been very satisfied with their products that's what drew me to this set of headphones in the first place. At present I don't do video games, but I do a lot of video work which includes editing soundtracks.<br /><br />  Besides I found it annoying to have to take my headphones off every time I wanted to step away from the computer. And the headphones I have which also are Logitech were not the most comfortable after an extended period of time. So I decided to treat myself to an upgrade and why not go wireless.<br /><br />  I received my new G930 headphones within 24 hours of ordering, and was able to put them  to work immediately, set up was a snap I didn't even use the disc include. I knew if I got stuck the disc would help me out. Within five minutes they were up and running I was able to use my Dragon speak after a few minutes of testing and playing music with even easier. As a matter of fact I'm typing this with my Dragon speak as I speak LOL. I hope you get as much enjoyment out of these headphones as I did.<br /><br />Thanks Will
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I remember watching this series several years back. I enjoyed it then and I have enjoyed it now. Thank you
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a very nice game.  It downloaded easily.  It was very easy to learn.  There are several levels of hardness.  Professionally done.  Bravo.
0525478817|5.0|This book honestly takes my breath away somehow it is an amazing love story and at the same time a completely tragic one. John Green has created amazing characters that anyone would fall in love with. I want my own Augustus Waters (well minus the cancer) some people call him pretentious but I think he is amazing not to say he isn't kind of an idiot but if he wasn't he wouldn't be a believable teenage boy. Hazel is just so inspiring an amazing person who is dying but still cares about the others around her more than her own feelings. I'm not the type of person to reread any book but this book I will probably reread a thousand times.
B00005V9HH|5.0|New, and in perfect condition, not to mention, a smart movie. I would highly recommend it to those who like movies that make you think.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's been many years since I first read Ender's Game and decided to re-read it when I learned they were making a movie from it.  So glad I did. What a remarkable and inventive read!  I now plan on going ahead and reading the rest of the quintet - again.
B0019SYKDK|5.0|This is a book I fell in love with in the 70's!!! I laughed and laughed. Cat's Cradle is one two Vonnegut books that are the best books I have ever read.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This did have 5 stars but since they haven't updated with the last 2  rooms there is no reason for me to play on here. My phone DOES have the update so now I have to play on my phone
B00012FXAE|5.0|This item arrived in perfect condition and I bought the DVD of Aliens, to replace my VHS format. GREAT action movie, and one of my favorite Sci Fi movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely addictive show. Ended up watching all three seasons back to back almost non-stop. The writers of the show did a great job of inserting new material while keeping the feel of the comics.
0896898288|5.0|Great book by Hird. Printing is outstanding. Ms. Hird is very quick with orders and got package well wrapped. Letters from the wives gave you a fascinating look at early 20th century women's life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It is a must read, could not put it down! A great story full of hope, love and suspense. Definitely will recommend to friends.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The performers are wonderful; the script is skillfully written; and Joss Whedon's direction plays to both.  If you haven't already bought it--why not?
B001BKVWYG|5.0|i do love the music i recommend this for everyone<br />iv had it for two weeks now and have just about worn it out<br />i just cant get enught of it
B004QX07G4|3.0|Ellen is a bright, funny and engaging celebrity.  Reading this book, I felt it was geared to a generic audience, one that doesn't do much reading, say a tenth grade level. I expected to laugh out loud yet was barely smiling throughout my read. Disappointing. Would not buy and read any more of her books. Prefer her TV show.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This was so amazing I could not put it down. It was the best book in the series in my opinion.
030788743X|5.0|Although classified as YA, this fast-moving sf adventure will be enjoyed by all ages.  But it and judge for yourself.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I have notoriously high-maintenance babies: colic, reflux, dairy intolerance...anything that could make sleep difficult, they have. I have been the human pacifier for far too long, but not so anymore! This mobile is pure magic.<br /><br />Things I like:<br />Leaves flutter up and down, as well as traditional spinning mobile action. Very enticing to baby.<br /><br />Music is nice, not annoying. Mine are all labeled correctly, unlike some reviews I read.<br /><br />Light is a dim, soft glow. Enough to see baby by, but not too bright to keep baby awake.<br /><br />Been using it heavily for 3+ weeks now and no indication that the batteries are wearing down yet. So, doesn't just devour them which is nice.<br /><br />Has a remote<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The remote. It is one button, which I sometimes have to click a couple times to make work. It turns the mobile back on to whatever lights/music combo you last had it set at (mobile plays for 15 minutes and then automatically shuts off). HOWEVER. The remote will only work to turn the mobile on/off for one hour since the last time you pushed a button on the actual mobile itself. Guess they don't want you to leave your baby crying for more than an hour before you have to actually go to him/her. ;) Smart idea I guess.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|i really enjoyed the music throughout the movie and that helped keep the time from dragging on too much.  fantastic score, very inspiring and catchy.
B009VB97EY|4.0|The character of Magic Mike was outstanding. He is a fabulous dancer and definitely played the role well. The plot of the story seemed to have gotten lost towards the end... It kind of left me hanging when it ended.
B00003CXI1|5.0|A brilliant adaptation of a beloved book sets the tone for the 7 films that follow--a wonderful introduction to Hogwarts.
B00000DOZ4|5.0|What can be said about Led Zeppelin that hasn't already been said.  They were the biggest band of the 70's.  This album was one of their best ones.
B007MDQW3W|4.0|Bought it on a lark. Love her voice. some nice songs but not all. blah blah blah blah blah blah
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The cast and crew of Suits have overtaken themselves this season. In this season plot twists are twister, comebacks are wittier, and feelings are stronger. In all a stellar performance that stretches far and beyond last seasons. I highly recommend this series to everyone because I feel that this series has something for everyone. See you there...
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories never grow old.  Whether you are a 12-year-old encountering the detective--and Dr. Watson--for the first time, or a retiree enjoying a Victorian world first entered long ago, this book is essential.  Return to 1885--the game's afoot!
B001BANK32|5.0|If you're a fan of reading books, fiction or non fiction, this book is a must read. Gripping storytelling from start to finish, very few do it better then Stephen King. Take a day off, go sit at a park bench or your favorite reading place, and enjoy a true masterpiece. King makes you feel like you're in the Overlook hotel with Danny. Greatness doesn't need to be over-described, just read the book!
B009A9BEHU|4.0|Love the production and sound quality! We watch it all the time.  If Coldplay knew they were using footage from certain shows for the DVD, why could he resist using the F-word so often in the live footage and interviews?? My kids love the band, and the parents hate the vulgarity.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It was enjoyable if you want something easy and fun to watch. If you like Glee, then you'll enjoy Pitch Perfect.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Others may vote for EMMA, but the story of Elizabeth Bennett and FitzWilliam Darcy's stormy romance has been read, dramatized, and filmed more times for the delectation of more readers.  Enjoyed by teens through centenarians for two centuries, this comedy of manners belongs in every collection.  A true comfort read--and a delight!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really like this because my son and I can do it together or alone. I found it relaxing and the fact that I will never have to throw away the puzzle due to one lost or damaged piece was an extra added bonus!!!
B003GAMOIW|5.0|This movie is highly recommended. The camera work is certainly poetic and beautiful. The theme of the need to understand responsibility as a means to actually live with free will, is also the hopeful message that the way to find true love is to be responsible as an individual and bring this strength to your marriage...no cheap tricks here!!! Once again a beautiful video.
B00BF2UKDE|2.0|If it weren't for the irritating fact that my favorite local radio station, KEXP, seems to like playing my least favorite track off of this, \\"We No Who U R,\\" I wouldn't bother writing a review of this.  I like Nick Cave's musical artistry in general, that song just seems so cold and threatening, with so little redeeming value, I thought I would share my irritation at it for arbitrarily contributing to fear and making intimidation seem acceptable. The fnords are strong with that one.
B002JVWR4U|4.0|A solid year for a great tv series, which should have been renewed.  Dushku & the rest of the cast are strong, but it's Whedon's writing & direction that rule!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a good book. It is the best out of the 7. I like it it very much. GOOD!!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have had at least 6 different &quot;sound machines&quot; I call them.  Including a $200 model.  I havnt noticed the loop as I have with many others.  It was free but is worth its asking price abd then much more.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|tired of streams not loading. only keeping it because its the only of its kind. but its worthless. usually end up watching the game on youtube and quitting this app. plus no chat on this version. such a waste.
B000W746GK|4.0|The second film in the Harry Potter series is another excellent book adaptation.  The cast, design, direction--all combine to bring Hogwarts to life once more.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A very good read but a little strange. I really liked the narration being in letter form but it sometimes made the story a little confusing and jumbled.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|Liked the movie, but the film quality was poor.  We paid for HD and it was fuzzy half the time.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Helloween never disappoint, they deliver year after year after year. One of my absolute favourite bands in the world. Have loved them since 1986 :)
B008YKGQR4|3.0|it keeps signing me out over and over while I'm doing stuff. fix that and I'll gladly give you more stars.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game! it is amazing. It makes you think really hard. I do not know how else to put it.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I got this as the free app of the day, and it's a pretty decent puzzle game, though I wish there were more or changing blocks instead of the same colors and symbols. Over all it's not bad, kind of like a rubik's cube meets a memory game.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|What a great way to finish the series.  The Dark Knight Rises is absolutely the best of the three but they are all good.
0375869026|5.0|While searching for a book to use for an assignment in one of my elementary education college courses, I stumbled upon \\"Wonder\\".  Wow.  This book is incredible, start to finish.  Words cannot adequately describe how much I love this book.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.  Highly HIGHLY recommend.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|Before we start, get an idea of my opinion here; Top songs: 1. In My Darkest Hour, 2. Into the Lungs of Hell, 3. Set the World Afire, 4. Hook in Mouth, 5. Mary Jane, 6. Liar, 7. 502.<br /><br />Since the Live In Buenos Aires 2005 concert, STWA hasn't been played much, I think it's on the top 20 of Megadeth songs. Anyway, this album is awesome. In my opinion this is one of the albums that helped place Megadeth at the peak of Metal.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|It's a pretty fun game, you tilt your kindle or tablet to move the fist to absorb the white light while avoiding the dark blobs. It's cute and amusing.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the best Bond movie yet!  Non stop action and I loved it.  Can't wait for them to make another one!
1594203334|5.0|This book is a treasure! My only regret is not reading it sooner. Druckerman is hilarious, but she also offers a new twist to some of the great parenting dilemmas like sleeping and eating. Within a week of reading this book our 18 month old was sleeping through the night. Really, is there anything more to say? Of all the complex, scientific, MD written books on babies and sleep, this was the only one that made sense to us and offered us a clear path to results. And it was fun through and through. A must read for all new parents!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I dont usually play games. I am slowly becoming addicted to this one though. Its a GREAT game ! 2 Thumbs Up !
B00723NWJE|4.0|I like the sound of Norah Jones.<br />Compared to other music by her I think this album is not the best but I still find myself liking and enjoying the music.
B00003CXQX|4.0|It came earlier than said and in great shape<br />I'll use them again. No problems at all  Awesome excellent and unforgettable
B004HD61KE|4.0|I enjoyed the historical aspects of this book and was happy to find they were mostly accurate. Some of the action was a little predictable but still exciting.  Overall o worthwhile read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you like solitaire you will like this.There are several options you can choose from such as the type of game you would like to play.It has autocomplete so you do not have to manually put the cards by suit when you win.<br />Because this app is free you have to deal with annoying adds for a second or two.That is my only complaint about this game.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Okay, first I don't give many, if any, five stars. I don't have cable so I watch the show over my laptop with a thumb drive connection - Not exactly optimal viewing conditions. I get to watch some fox, CW, ABC, and CBS crime drama, and eventually, it all turns to BS after a period of - oh, say ten minutes or so. Not this show; well written and even after 10 episodes still has you guessing as to what is going on. This isn't the best review but I hoped you'd get the point with something different. I didn't think crime drama would have me not being able to wait till I can see the next episode, though, this show I want to watch back to back (because I'll know they're not solving the huge mystery in the next forty-five minutes).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible reading app! Love that there is an option to listen to audio on some versions.  Easier to keep up with daily reading that way!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 3 is by far the best yet. The evolution of Rick's character has been exciting to watch and the acting is superb IMO. The end of this episode left my wife and I in eager anticipation of the next episode. Can't wait to see Rick snap on one-eyed Willy!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love Temple Run, so I was really excited when this came out. It was great, but it glitches a lot and it isn't very smooth. It also crashes. A lot. I end up having to delete it and redownload it, and when I do, all my previous data is gone. This is an amazing game, just keep fixing all the bugs and crashes and it would be better.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|the second movie in any franchise always has to try and be better......in this case, even though the special effects are awesome in this movie..it lacks the energy of the first one
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great story. I don't think it could have had a better ending. The trilogy is tragic, but by the end it shows how tragedy and brokenness<br />can actually open one up, allowing you to take in love like you couldn't do before. Beautiful.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|ad pops up after every level attempt and reset.  Causes game to force close.  Can't play at all.  Hope this prob is resolved.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|People hated on Adore when it was released. People hated on Machina when it was released and also on Zeitgeist. Now most people tend to remember those albums and the songs on them fondly. Heck people are warming up to Zeitgeist now and it was trashed over and over again by most fans. The thing is that Billy Corgan always puts out music that's different than his previous music. This usually rubs fans the wrong way upon release but then it grows on them over time. By the time the next release comes out people will be crying foul that it's not as good as Oceania. While I still love the classic stuff from Machina on back, the new stuff is good too, maybe not as good but there is some great music on there nonetheless. Oceania is a fantastic cd for the most part, there are a few clunkers (something that couldn't be said for the old pumpkins cds) but it is still a great listen.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Case is water proof and I will use when boating, but not for everyday use. Sound quality not good; everyone I talked with said it sounded like I was in a tunnel and had difficulty hearing me.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I think it is ok but not great. I think you should be able to earn more coins and I really don't think you should have to buy some of the characters but have to get their items from the mystery boxes like how you have to with the other characters.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|This is my first Nesbo/Harry hole novel. Liked it a lot, especially the Northern Europeon flavor. I'll be looking for more of this series.
1451638450|4.0|The latest installment in this long running series.  In this book, Bujold switched protagonists by making the unambitious but dutiful (and chivalrous) Ivan Vorpatril the hero.  As readers of this series know, Ivan usually appears as a hapless straightman for the usual hero, Ivan's hyperactive cousin Miles Vorkosigan.  The latter does not appear in this book, which may disappoint some but this book is probably better than the last couple of novels starring Miles Vorkosigan.  Bujold, who has real talent as a comedic writer, successfully incorporates some farcial elements into this book.  There is an enjoyable expansion of her future history, and like all her books, the quality of writing is quite good.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|.Will stick with my original beloved Mahjong.  I just thought a new edition would have some<br />different games.  Not worth the trouble.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Great app very fun. I have became very addictive I just . . . . . . . . Love it
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|works pretty well....just takes some practice. The actual glass cutter though is rather cheap, with a crimped on wooden handle. but, it does work, it will cut the glass, and performs as advertised. my first attempt provided a chivas regal scotch bottle lamp. the cut was 98% perfect with only one small crack. but, with practice, i am sure i can get better like the guy in the videos that led me to this product (youtube:how to cut bottles).
B0085LMFAE|5.0|I downloaded this because I originally had it on tape and no longer have a tape player.  I think the tape became unspooled, as well.  It's as good as I remember.  I think this is one of Paul Simon's best, if not the best.  That's saying a lot!
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I selected Calengoo after a number of failed attempts to find a calendar that works.<br />This one seems to be quite idiot proof, it syncs with your desktop Google calendar<br />quite seamlessly and thus far has not been too difficult to use, for an older techno challenged<br />person.  Try it.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I purchased for friend as I have a copy. Also had watched on PBS.<br />Because I enjoyed so very much wanted to share.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I really like Daniel Craig as Bond. The new Bond series shows a man that is not indestuctable like in the past.
014103579X|3.0|The quality of the picture inside this book are of horrible quality. You have to squint to try to understand what is in the content of the picture. Very disappointed about that.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Connects my mobile devices--Ipad and droids to my office networked pc, my home networked pc and IMAC. It's a sweet solution to access email, and if you're really desperate, edit any work using native applications... Though the interface can be challenging to use, especially on smaller remote devices. Desktop to desktop... It's very sweet.. Only limited by connection...
1582701709|5.0|I have watched the DVD several times and knew reading the book would deliver content that is not deliverable any other way! If your going to read this book you must read the series to get the full message it is life changing material.<br /><br />The seller delivered the product in perfect condition and much faster than expect.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This move was so bad I could not watch the whole movie. It was that awful, I want my two hours back.
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|I mean seriously I like the snowy owl better but then again it was the first book I had on my kindle still not my favorite book
B009FZHYKU|4.0|My husband and I just recently starting watching the AMC series and had missed seasons 1, 2 and the first half of season 3.  Thanks for letting us catch up with all the past episodes!
B008YI91HS|5.0|excellent movie, plot, sub-plots and characters. Have seen it several times but this was the first time for my 14-year-old son. will definitely watch it again! The kids were fantastic actors!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|started out with free version for my kindle fire.  lots of hidden objects...some puzzles...and good story.  i decided to unlock full version for $2.99 and the rest of the game was well worth the money.  HOURS of playing time.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I know what you're thinking:  Wow.  A fictionalized account of ITIL and Agile methodologies.  That sounds so...exciting.<br /><br />But it is!<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I was completely sucked into Bill's world.<br /><br />IT Operations isn't always a fun place to work: servers crash; applications freeze; vulnerabilities are everywhere; and customers--both internal and external--scream for support.<br /><br />So how to you manage all of the Work in Progress (WIP), emergencies, and planned work?  It's enough to give any professional geek a panic attack.<br /><br />Enter our heroes: ITIL and Kanban.<br /><br />These Best Practice methodologies will help Bill and his team revolutionize how IT functions and contributes to the business at large.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project takes a dry subject and turns it into an understandable narrative.  Certain concepts that I didn't quite grasp when I studied for my ITIL certification became crystal clear during the course of this book.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to implementing a Kanban board with my team at work.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I was looking for a good workout I could do at home.  I like this one because it is short (20 minutes), has 3 levels, and combines strength, cardio, and abs.
B008YI9CWW|2.0|Spoiler alerts in general: many of the scenes/characters didn't make sense: the woman who  insisted that they were there only to observe and document -  and not even to bend a blade of grass - pets a baby dino?? and is then surprised that the mother goes after her?? and then actually takes a T-rex baby into her trailer? and is surprised when that momma dino goes after her?? Just idiotic nonsense. I had to laugh when the supposed big game hunters with their rifles all ran screaming away from the dinos without firing a shot - and one of the observers felt proud of himself for unloading a hunter's gun - allowing the dinos to eat more members of their party. Just idiotic nonsense! Worse, no one even wonders at the end (major spoiler alert!) what ate the crew (who must have set a course for the dock upon their departure?) when the Trex was locked away in the hold. Nothing came together in this movie. A huge disappointment. My advice: Watch the first and second movie the same night, but start drinking during the first Jurassic Park movie so you can laugh through the second and not feel bad for wasting your time!
B002HEOLH0|5.0|enjoy this album on a road trip or simply doing chores-takes your mind off of whatevers going on-very enjoyable! Loved!
B0055S348W|5.0|I have tried three other printer apps on my Kindle Fire and had poor results with each one. Printer Share works beautifully  just as I hoped it would. Automatically locks in on WiFi printer. It is easy to use and you don't  have to be an expert. It has many options like page margins, page orientation, and selection of pages. Would recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game. Its incredibly addictive. Really like the way the missions are set up. Would recommend this game to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game because it is a lot of fun and looks good. I think there are a lot of things to do and they are interesting. It is very  easy to learn because it shows you what to do before you have to do it yourself. I like the competitions. They are run. I like this game!
8857206882|5.0|Picture and fonts are just in perfect size for easy reading.<br />This book opens up other possibilities on shooting for landscape photography.
B008YW5RH2|2.0|I cannot get the character to swing where and when I want it to.This makes it very hard to play at times,but it will sometimes work.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty much your basic runner. Controls are responsive enough. Not too big of a file size, but be careful of permissions if you care.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Within 5 pages of the first book I was hooked.  I'm the first in my group to read this (and admit it) but my one-on-one reviews have sent my friends scrambling for the Trilogy.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed....not with any of the three.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I recommend this book that is relatable to any large urban city in America.  Many characters to keep straight at the onset, but each develops with the plot. I enjoyed the book but it was a dose of depressing reality
B0054YH8DY|2.0|One of cd's were unable to listen to samples,CD's had almost all same songs  i should not have purchatured not knowing what songs were on it.
B000T433CO|5.0|I bought these as gifts for co teachers for christmas after seeing it. I thought it was good mix of funny and romatic content. Its a great holiday watch or a weekend video for the couch
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was so shocked with the ending of the first book that I couldn't wait to get my grubby hands on Book 2.  This story just gets better and better.  Will good overcome not-so-good?  Wait and see.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting character study with a good twist.  Good book to discuss in a book club. I recommend this to friends and family.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was very helpful.<br />The definitions were great<br />I will look forward to seeing it in Spanish<br />I wish you the best of luck
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed a few episodes on TV and purchased some to catch up with on the Kindle Fire. The show is getting a tad ridiculous and over-wrought, but it's still great watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers is a great game.I totally loved it. My mother think the game is violent because they slammed into the trains. But she totally wrong, she don't even know how to play.You BETTER buy this!!
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I only read the preview and there is no way I could read this book.  The going back and forth between dates makes it hard to follow and the girl who always has to check everything 20 times is just annoying.  Not for me.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I loved to see people get eatten by sharks of games I love it. I home you love it too.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this book, can't wait to read the next one, I hope the movies are as good as the books........
B004D20JP2|3.0|I liked the graphics and the music; however, the scene where the duck is eaten by the wolf is very graphic for little children and the bullying/violence shown I dont consider appropiate for classroom use. Other than that is ok.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Sometimes it stops Up and turn black Up and then the game shuts off but the game is cool and it has this thing when your not connected to WiFi it still lets you play
B008OTTSX4|5.0|I loved this cd and think most of the artist did an excellent job of covering the songs on this album.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|No comments as to the feature, but the BRD quality, extras, packaging overall is 5/5.  Includes digital copies as well!
B0031RS7MW|5.0|A really wonderful book, Highly recommend this book for it's literary excellence, interesting plot and alluring characters.Sent me straight to the kitchen to cook up chocolate treats!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Awesome....Damon cliff hanger... have to read the last one now...can't wait to see what happens in the end.. woo whoo
B009D5VPTI|5.0|The kids really liked this show it was very entertaining for them and I must admit for us to. I would highly recommend it to anyone has young children or even young at heart. The graphic effects  were superb.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Just finished reading this wonderful love story, and had to re-read the end through my tears. All through the book, I knew what lay ahead for the lovers, but the author skillfully portrayed their love story in ever surprising ways.  The prose is simple yet the story is a complex one.  Loved every minute of Louisa and Will's story and will remember it for a long time to come.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Loved escaping into the world of Emma. How different life was back then. A history lesson in its self. I am committed to reading all of Jane Austen's literary works.

B009INALYU|5.0|This record is one of the best things that happened with music. Rare photos and b-sides that is the reason to purchase anniversary edition. I just want to have this brilliant record in my collection.
B007TK77QE|3.0|An interesting read although a little confusing with all the characters to keep track of. Having sorted them all out I was a little disturbed by the &#34;dark&#34; nature of some of them. Held my interest enough to finish it.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Love this season, cannot wait for season 5. Very addictive series that keeps you guessing what is next. The Blu-ray quality is great.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was really good to read on my e-reader it reminded me a litlle of 50 shades of grey.
B00005K3O4|5.0|I just love this movie.<br />I made all my friends watch it with me.<br />It is an old time cult classic
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I wish I had this when I was in school it would have made my homework a lot faster. cool and easy to use.
B005DJGMQE|3.0|Wanted to watch this after seeing Lincoln. Knew some of the background, but really helps flesh out the story of co-conspirator Mary Surratt.  Echos the fear and reactivity post 9/11, esp. the suspension of legal rights and the reliance on Military Tribunals instead of civilian courts.  Got me researching more about the Surratt clan and Frederick Aiken's (Mary's overmatched lawyer's) life post-trial. I'll watch anything Redford is involved in, and this was good, not great as a piece of acting and a piece of storytelling.  Mixed review on historical accuracy (like Lincoln), but it's a good conversation starter, raising important legal, moral and political issues, and the risks of repeating the mistakes of history.
0345803507|5.0|I really loved fifty shades freed it was really exotic and entertaing I read all 3 books on my e-reader.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Megan is running from a very, very bad, abusive marriage straight to her brother's home, but the brother dies before she arrives and that's when the story starts.  She gets there just in time for the funeral and afterwards is taken in by the town of Pride and the family her brother had been friends with and gone into business with. She's determined not to become a victim again and to have no personal relationships for a long time.  She fails, of course, and that happy failure is the story of this book.<br />It's not an elegantly written book but the story is alive and true and the characters come across as real people and the town of Pride, Oregon as a place I'd like to visit.<br />I give this book 4 stars.  Professional editing would have improved it.  A few typos and a little incorrect English language stuff, nothing major.  And I thought the hero, who is great and wonderful and well portrayed by the author, somewhat resembled the villain, who is as bad and as awful as it's possible for a villain to be.  At least it seemed that way to me.  But those things were minor and in no way detracted from the story.
B008RC72G8|5.0|I am a Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Dark Shadows fan.  Ran home from school to watch it at 4pm when I was young.  Although this story is not the 'usual' story line, I am so happy to have Jonathan Frid's last cameo appearance.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|What a ride by a plotting genius and master emotion manipulator ! I will be thinking over scenes from this book  and concepts for a long time.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this app! It's really cute, has cool dragons and you can get friends via Facebook who can send you gifts! This app is a must have and any self-respecting person with a tablet/ smartphone should get it! Only problem is the waiting for things to be built or hatched.

B00979CS50|5.0|As a longtime fan, I'm very satisfied with this new Neil Young and Crazy Horse album. A double CD set? What a wild and crazy ---and wonderful --- idea! This one is definitely for the fans; a raw and pure set of tunes, electric guitar bliss and honest emotion that all packs a punch. If you like Neil Young albums such as &#34;Freedom&#34; or &#34;Rust Never Sleeps&#34; that treads similar ground, except that most of the songs are VERY long. I think &#34;opus&#34; has been used a few timest to describe the long tunes, and that's a spot on assesment. But even when Neil wanders on for ten or twenty, or close to thirty minutes, I don't find it boring at all. There is a familiarity to this music in the sense that it doesn't cover any new sonic ground, but I find that very comforting and very satisfying. Hey, I'm a big fan and I LOVE this style of Neil Young music, I'm just delighted he still has the passion and can put about albums as fine as this one. Carry on, brother!

B008NEVP1S|5.0|Well, she certainly charmed me with the outstanding collection of songs. I made the mistake of ignoring her releases in the past decade-plus, but I'm so impressed with the songs on this album that I now aim to go back and listen to Aimee Mann's other recent efforts. Song after song on &#34;Charmer&#34; resonates with pop perfection. I love her rich and expressive vocals, and the songs on here are bursting with hooks and pop goodness. A masterful album, one of the year's very best.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Son loves it super product my little boy is autisic and this is great for eye and hand coordination<br />awsome

B006C1DH92|5.0|Wow, what a fun, entertaining game to play. Great way to unwind after a busy day.  My one year old granddaughter showed me how to play it on her dad's kindle.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I picked this up on one of the deal postings, and start to finish it is a tempo-changing marvel. It definitely makes my best of list for 2012, but I'm partial to mandolin and edge of the cliff vocals.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|All time Christmas classic.  The ONLY bad part is that Chevy Chase drops the &#34;f&#34; bomb in the movie once.  Unnecessary.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good way to burn time while waiting at Dr. office or sitting on the crapper...lol. i use it all the time
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My experience with this app is very entertaining from what I have played. I hope have more pleasant encounters with this app. This app was the only one that had a horse where it was like you are actually doing something. Unlike you pressing a button and it say, &quot;Please wait for this to load, so you can move on!&quot;<br />I would recommend this to any horse lover out there. It may not be exactly like having your horse with you, but pretty close!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I find that playing this app helps me to clear my mind and relax.  I call it meditating.  Better then most paid apps.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys know how to arrange and play music. So inspiring, I bought 13 copies for friends and family. There isn't a day thst has gone by that I don't listen to at least a few songs.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|I couldn't wait for this movie to come out. When it did, I took a risk and paid $12 to go see it. At the end of the movie, I was once again disappointed at the lack of plot and I don't know who in the hell is writing this garbage but, once again another movie where a director sat in has own feces and called it \\"brilliant\\". It sucked plain and simple. To all of you directors out there \\"Go back to school and learn how to make a good horror from beginning to end\\" Dummies!

B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun classic gone mobile! I loved this game on my PC but really love it on my Kindle. Smooth play and no glitches. Great game!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game. I have played since May 2012, usually several times a day. While there definitely are some glitches, I have not suffered many of them. However,  I had to restart because I replaced my Kindle (Amazon customer service did a great job for me when my much used Kindle Fire developed a port problem and could no longer be recharged.) The only thing that I cared about that couldn't be backed up either in the Amazon cloud or on my computer was my OTAS town. I miss it :(  Please,  Amazon or Gameloft,  find a way for Kindle Fire users to save their progress in this game. (Ipad and Iphone users can back up theirs through the iTunes store.)

B008R6MI8G|4.0|If you like this sort of thing it's very good.  Action, romance history and Liam, what is not to like.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Now I know why Angry Birds are a hit! Fun, fun game. Be careful if you have &#34;one click&#34; activated on your Kindle as you may buy programs unwittingly by hitting the well placed ads :o)
B007IXWKUK|2.0|better character development but no plot. Characters only seem to have a few phrases they re-use over and over. Predictable

B005KELW26|5.0|I love this cover for my Kindle Fire! The corner tabs give me full access to the Kindle screen and it has a really durable cover. Props up nicely for movies as well. Great price and an even greater quality for the price. Would highly recommend.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This film has gotten a lot of great reviews in the press and it really lived up to them. Take the source material really seriously and is an obvious love letter to the work. Earnest at every turn. Check it out if you like good old fashion action films.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I loved this Bond movie. But hated what happened. Craig is a great James Bond. Good Story. And Lots of action
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I can see how a creative mind would really enjoy this game, but I must not be very creative because I gave up after only a few games. I didn't care to purchase solutions so I just let it go...If I can't figure it out on my own it's kinda not worth it to me...
B000BRBA8S|2.0|What potential!  A failed writer develops the idea of a place in the year 2046 that you can travel to in order to get reunited with people and events you desire.  But he is the first, ever, to want to return from 2046.  Why?<br /><br />This movie, 2046, moves between the writer and his failed romances.  He is never a likable person, usually emotionless yet surrounded by emotional people.  He pines over unfulfilled fantasies, while trivializing his time with his sexual partners.<br /><br />I can't recommend this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|All elements needed in game can be earned in game no buying needed sweet game and large number of different animals to get
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have both of the Quell games and have really enjoyed them. Low stress with relaxing music but addictive with the challenging puzzles. No glitches on my Kindle. Highly recommend.
1609611543|2.0|Fortunately, I got this book from the library and didn't pay good $$ for it. After reading it, I was unimpressed not only with the writing but also the content. Most of the information can be read for free on hundreds of blogs and web sites or by going to your library, many with more research supporting the whole gluten-free trend.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I decided to read some reviews and, wow, there are some passionate opinions from reviewers, and heated back-and-forths between individuals claiming to be cardiologists and physicians even!<br /><br />To me the bottom-line is: what do you \\"want\\" to gain from this book? Are you interested in losing weight? Or are you trying to find out if wheat is making you sick?<br /><br />If weight loss is your secondary concern and you are looking for symptom-relief, you should only eliminate one possible culprit at a time. Otherwise, how can one prove THAT particular item was the problem?<br /><br />Likewise, if you eliminate wheat AND corn starch, potato starch, potato flour, rice flour, tapioca starch, etc. and you reduce dairy, and only eat these specific fruits (all suggestions in the book) and you start to feel better, then how will you know ... prove ... wheat was the offender? Maybe dairy is the problem.<br /><br />If you believe wheat is wrecking your body, eliminate wheat and find out. If you don't improve, add it back and try eliminating dairy ... and so on.<br /><br />If you are trying this tactic to lose weight, you must take a different approach depending on your current diet. If you are eating a healthy diet and are exercising regularly, but just can't lose the gut, you could possibly lose a few pounds by eliminating or reducing your whole grain items.<br /><br />But here's the catch: if you eliminate wheat but replace the loss of it with gluten-free substitutes that are higher in calories than their wheat counterparts, you will not lose weight and could gain weight! And you may become constipated since you will be removing fiber from whole grains.<br /><br />How do I know? Long before reading this book, I tried going gluten-free to see if it would help my IBS, eczema and high blood pressure issues. My husband, trying to be supportive, bought me a cookbook with 1,000 gluten-free recipes. But there were two problems: (1) no nutrition information was included with the recipes so I had no idea if I was swapping even calories, etc.; and (2) I actually begin eating more carbs than I was consuming before going gluten-free.<br /><br />When I eliminated gluten, breakfast options were limited. After eating eggs a million different ways, I was running out of ideas, so I utilized the recipes in the cookbook for breads, muffins, popovers, waffles and much, much more.<br /><br />By month's end, I'd gained eight pounds and was constipated to the point of severe pain. From this I learned that simply eliminating gluten did absolutely nothing to fix my problem and caused new problems.<br /><br />And there is your explanation for the ending of the book wherein Dr. Davis shifts gears to recommend what is basically a low glycemic index or low-carb diet. He states if you need to lose significant weight, you should eliminate wheat, but also all the things wheat-free recipes use as substitutions for wheat gluten. Therefore, you can't make your own bread, muffins, cornbread, pasta, pizza crust, pancakes, etc. using wheat-free ingredients.<br /><br />He goes on to say, you should eliminate rice in all forms and fruits with a high sugar content ... and suddenly this book isn't just about wheat anymore.<br /><br />The recommendations in this book will help people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivities (although there are far better books available) relieve many symptoms.<br /><br />As for a weight loss guide, I believe it might work for some people depending on their current eating habits. Another words, if your current diet is high in wheat carbs and you cut out wheat altogether and replacethose calories with healthy fats, lean proteins, vegetables and certain fruits, for obvious reasons you will lose weight.<br /><br />And when you lose weight, naturally, your health will improve - lower blood pressure, relief for sore joints and achy muscles, improved bowel function, etc. - and you will feel better.

B008BDZP30|4.0|Prior to the release of \\"Chunga's Revenge\\", each of Zappa's albums had felt and sounded like cohesive units.  Whether relying on vocals (Ruben and the Jets, We're Only In it for the Money) or instrumentals (Uncle Meat, Burnt Weeny Sandwich), each album felt like it originated from the same source and was inspired by the same overriding theme.  \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" marks the first time Zappa would compile an album from a variety of sources (live, studio, different permutations of different bands)and produce something that, when all is said and done, sounds like a collection of songs, and not a cohesive album.<br />  Thankfully, though, the songs work, mostly thanks to the inclusion of four distinctly different instrumentals.  \\"Transylvania Boogie\\" is an excerpt from a live guitar solo and ranks as one of Frank's career bests.  The title track is an instrumental powerhouse that features another Frank guitar solo, that would go on to be a perennial live favorite.  \\"Twenty Small Cigars\\" is Frank in his semi-classical mode, and \\"The Nancy and Mary Music\\" is a lengthy excerpt from a live \\"King Kong\\".<br />  Interspersed among these tracks are several vocal numbers which, while fun, honestly do not rank as Frank's best work.  \\"Road Ladies\\" is a predictable blues romp about groupies, while \\"Tell Me You Love Me\\" is a predictable semi-metal burst of agonized love.  \\"Would You Go All the Way?\\" and \\"Rudy Wants To Buy Yez a Drink\\" prominently feature Flo 'n' Eddie (from the Turtles) and are two songs which, while enjoyable, were never performed again once this band broke up.  Easily forgettable and Frank knew it.  The gem in the crown of \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" is \\"Sharleena\\", a slightly doo-wopish love song that features excellent vocals and would eventually evolve into a live, guitar solo showcase.<br />  The interesting thing about this album is that even though many of the individual pieces do not impress all that much, the album, as a whole, somehow works because of its odd lack of cohesion.  The instrumental tracks are so different and unique that the momentum they provide carries the listener through  the more pedestrian vocal tracks.  It seems like the album should not work, but somehow it does.  \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" is definitely one of Frank's lesser artistic statements, but nonetheless, it is an enjoyable listening experience.f cohesion.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I run. This book, though running is a theme of it, is not a story of running, but is a story of mystery, adventure, action, and even anthropology. It tells of the secretive Tarahumara, the Running People of Mexico. We discover their secrets along with a group of interesting, some would say eccentric, ultra runners who venture into the barely accessible Copper Canyons to meet these legendary runners on their own turf, though the word turf does not quite fit the rock and root strewn pathways that switchback the nearly vertical walls of these treacherous canyons. Through this adventure, all the participants are challenged to reevaluate what they believed to be truth and uncover for us pathways for our own journeys, whatever they may be.<br /><br />The narrative is so compelling, you won't want to stop reading, anxious to see what the next turn will bring. Yet you will be so enlivened, you won't want the book to end. And that's as close as you can get to running a race on paper.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because it is easy to use and find passages.  It has many different translations and languages too.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|The price was right and the product works well.  I'm using it to gather oral histories and it corrected an audio problem I was having.  Limitations for those who have used higher end lavaliers include that you can only clip the mic on facing one direction so be careful how you set up your subjects.  Also because of the on/off switch to help increase the life of your battery, be sure you remember to turn it on.  Other than that the product worked well and the long wire connecting to the  camera allowed for good flexibility in the positioning of the camera.

B0041KBWM0|5.0|Much better than Paltrow in the big screen version. For once I can say I like the movie better than the book.
B00B7FXZQS|5.0|If you like scary paranormal movies, this series(Paranormal Activity) is a good one to watch. As the story moves on and it seems like it could be the last one, it takes a twist and you just know there has got to be another one after this. It keeps you wondering what is gonna happen next.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone who wants to know about it
B002GYI9C4|5.0|An epic fantasy. First book by this author I've read, and I'll be getting more. Mistborn is an excellent concept and I look forward to reading more.
B001RLP862|5.0|Very nice playing cards..  Easy to clean and will hold up for a long time.  Would<br />recommend them to anyone,.
B006RED4GA|4.0|At first I thought this was just another copy cat thriller to past the evening away, to my surprise this wasn't what I expected for a low budget film.  Not only was it suspenseful, but it sure had some good scary moments.  If anyone wants to enjoy a good horror movie, I'd recommend you watch this with someone.  Oh yes...be sure and keep the lights on.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love, love love Downton Abbey...I spent one whole weekend catching up with the first season.  I don't know where I've been and why I'm so late to the game hearing about it.  I can't wait for Season 4!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I really looked forward to this movie - the reviews were hilarious.  I watched it with my 24 yr. old son, who (surprisingly) was disappointed in it too.  The beginning of the movie was cute and funny, but after the boy and bear grew up it turned into a sad, unsuccessful attempt at extremely crude and tasteless humor.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|A classic movie about a team of guys that found success against all odds! I still love it after seeing it for the hundredth time!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is definitely interesting. I did not expect many of the twists and turns the author takes you on. My problem  is I don't like the characters. I want them both to lose. I like the story but I need a hero and this book does not have one for me.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|A beautiful, beautiful movie - both in message and magnificent cinematography.  A delightfully profound movie, quite unlike any other I can recall.  You will be completely drawn into Pi's life with all of it's amazing turns, and will remember Pi and Richard Parker long after.  Excellent acting, beautiful scenery, amazing story!
B007BT0RKG|1.0|requires a large amount of data to be install  on device  plus requires to buy paid version to use features. Unable to download additional maps unless if you are in that region.<br />what a dissapointment :(
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I was so glad to find this. I really enjoy playing this on Facebook and now I can play it on my Kindle Fire too!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was an easy enjoyable read. It moved along quickly and the storyline was good. The caracters were very believable and I liked the book overall.
1616550414|5.0|This book is simply amazing. From the art to the in depth views of the zelda series, this is a book any true fan of zelda should pick up.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a calculator and didn't have one on hand so this app came through in a pinch.  I suppose as long as it comes up with the right answers, I couldn't go wrong.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Does exactly what it is supposed to do and protects my 11 year old's Kindle Fire.  He is constantly flipping it around, folding back the cover, switching it into viewing position, drops it from time to time, and so far - it's holding up very well.  Easy to clean and a very pretty bright red - he's a Kansas City Chiefs fan ;-)
1596434252|4.0|It is a great way to get kids interested.  It would have been a little better if each page had the letters written out, or on a pullout tab.
B004Y042N8|4.0|I think I got this as a special free app.  I only decided to get it just in case I needed something to entertain my daughter.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Excellent book on the sacrifice American military families make to protect others. Beautiful story of family, faith and service. I couldn't stop reading it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Each time I watch it I find something new, so interesting.  I wish all dvds/blu-rays were packaged this way.  Anytime I go to a friends I don't have to make sure he has blu-ray and it was incredibly easy to put it on all my devices.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Dell learns that life can come at you fast and then you get to spend a lifetime trying to figure out what it means. A good story that is probably a lot like many of our own lives where we live in a today that was shaped by the past.
B005LAIH54|4.0|The sequel of the previous release Clash Of The Titans is pretty much what we expect to see, the gods that are left still try to cling to power and it's up to Perseus to stop their machinations and protect humanity.Liam Neeson(Zeus),Ralph Fiennes(Hades) and Sam Worthington(Perseus) play their roles decently enough and the effects are pretty good but apart from the action and effects there really isn't any sense of real drama or suspense.As you watch the story unfold you feel more inclined to wait until the next action or fight scene rather then watch what's happening in between those segments. The price is decent enough to add this to your dvd library especially if you already have the first movie just keep expectations of a true dramatic story low.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game for those who enjoy this game in real life. I would have already spent all of my money in the first day! ! !
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Season 7 of Supernatural came back strong with an excellent and unique story line. Highly recommend this show. Start from the beginning! Every episode is worth it.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Let's be honest here the only reason we truly saw this movie was to see the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons and while we get that and the action and effects are pretty good some of the actors definitely felt unneeded and unwelcomed and sadly that includes a star of the movie Shia LaBeouf.  I don't mean to bash on him maybe it's his still boyish like looks which make him seem in the movie more like he's running away from a pack of bullies rather then a man trying to save the world. While most of the other cast were able to pull this off sadly he wasn't,also while it was nice to see some more autobots some also felt unneeded as they were given just some cameo shots and all you could think is &#34;Why bother putting them in the movie at all?&#34;.<br /><br />While I'm glad Peter Cullen came back to voice Optimus again in this movie it also felt somewhat like a waste a little but that's Michael Bay for you.Again while the special effects are good as well as the action scenes overall the story feels flat and half the characters stories are pretty generic two dimensional ones you've seen in a hundred other movies that go beyond cliche.Still if you can get the movie for $10 or less I say it might be worth adding to your collection just don't expect much from it.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This one will definitely leave you wanting for the next book, just to see what is going to happen next and how the web Martin has woven all comes together!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Works fine helps me sleep drowns out the outside world. Some sounds are better than others now I am done
B000I9YWDO|5.0|The technology has changed a little, but the office politics and B.S. has not! This is the third time I've seen this movie, and it just stays as funny even after multiple viewings. A real classic and should be required viewing for CEO's and leaders of large business everywhere!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The 007 formula really shows it's age (pun intended) in this one. And it's 2 hours 24 minutes could easily have been 2 hours 8 minutes mainly by cutting the last act in half. The opening sequence was almost up to standard. The romance portion is less then usual. All in all, a bit of a slacker this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You'll love this series.  It has great emotional draw.  I can't believe how it ended.  I will be anxiously awaiting season 4.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|whether you are athiest, agnostic or believer this story was extremely thought provoking and the story line intriguing. Hoover does a great job with characters that are real and eas to identify with.
0307454541|5.0|Great book, full of suspense, but be warned, there are some graphic scenes.  Love the twists and turns, and the characters are very interesting.
B005GRF2UK|5.0|I saw this movie on tv one night and I was thinking where can I get a copy of that movie?amazon It plays beautiful.It was worth it.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Not too much to say about it yet because I just started to use it. I think it will be great on my kindle for when I write letters to my daughter for her to read when she grows up.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I really enjoyed book, the character development is great, and I raced through it, cheering my favorite characters on.  It is full of suspense, waiting to see what befalls the characters.<br /><br />Really good read (though you definitely need to read the first in the series, Game of Thrones, before you dive into this one).
B00005LC4B|5.0|cape fear was on my list also to buy,and i have a long list.But I am enjoying my movie,it plays very very good.
B000MXPE74|5.0|this is a great cd why aren't listening to it right now? If you love indie music you can't go wrong!
B00164KYV4|4.0|As a fan of chick flicks, I really enjoyed this movie.  Lots of good actors, and fun punch lines, and some cute guys to boot.
B00181MHQU|3.0|It may be a classic but it's not my style of music.  Fell asleep before the ending.  Probably will not watch again.
0691152640|5.0|This is a terrific book that gives several hundred years of the history of financial shenanigans.  Others have reviewed it accurately and sung its praises. The writers are both very eminent, widely quoted experts on the topic.  They have a slightly ironic writing style that is very amusing.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I gave this album 5 stars because I just love Ray LaMontagne's raspy voice, and soulful music.  &#34;You Are The Best Thing&#34; is one of my favorite songs ever, and it just feels so truthful.  A bit folky, just the way I like it.
B00821OX98|5.0|The series is fantastic and keep one awake and I will recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction and believe that we are not the only species in space .
1451624468|5.0|I just got the book yesterday. Although I have not read the book in it's entirety yet, I am already excited by the information I've read. Similar to \\"A Brief History Of Time\\" It updates your view of the universe. I would wager that most people have an outdated view on the universe; something from the 1800's or even earlier! It's appalling to me that people in modern times in civilized countries haven't been taught about the most current information on the universe, the school system is really failing us in this area. Anyway, I suggest this to everybody, it's the beginnings of humanity understanding the very essence and true origins of the universe.
0060775858|5.0|I ordered this to replace the copy I have that is starting to fall apart from so much reading.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|For whatever reason this book did not absorb me the way a good book usually does but nevertheless, the story interested me and I felt compelled to read on.<br />The idea if this book is interesting enough that I want to check out the next in the series.
B000BBOV8U|5.0|Got this because my wife is a fan, turns out I like Bryan Adams a lot too. I remembered a lot of the songs when I heard them again. A great collection!
0060254920|5.0|This was great deal and I am so happy to have a good copy at the house for when my grandkids come to viist.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Some artists can talk about their influences, McCartney invites you to share in them as he recreates the memories.  Not a rock'n'roll album at all; the songs are presented with love and respect. The orchestrations are beautiful, but do not overwhelm the sometimes simple, jewel-like quality of the melodies.The songs are all songs that seem as fresh as the day the were written. And McCartney's original &#34;My Valentine&#34; fits in perfectly and is one of his most haunting melodies.
1416585710|5.0|I read Stephen King all the time.  He is my favorite author. Got this book at a cheap price and reasonable shipping and handling.  Thanks.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was an amazing movie. I really liked the acting, the directing and the costume design. However, trying to get the video to play on my media center PC crashed it. I tried to install the amazon unbox player and it messed up my computer and I had to system restore so my computer would work again.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|This has been one of my favorite Harrison albums; I was so happy to have it on CD and listen to it anew. The songs are sometimes dream-like and very blissful. &#34;Here Comes the Moon&#34; and &#34;Blow Away&#34; are especial favorites!
B0090SI42Y|1.0|One of the worst movies i have ever seen.If you really need to see it rent it.Don't waste you money .
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I ordered this book after the tragic death of Chris Kyle. I started reading it in the afternoon, and never stopped until 1 AM. A totally amazing book!!So well written, I felt Chris was here telling me his story!! Every true American should read this book, to understand what our men and women in uniform sacrifice for all of us.What a sad thing after all he gave to loose his life to a crazed killer!! I have ordered a copy to share with friends and family. God Bless you, Chris, may you Rest In Peace, you are a true American hero!! This book deserved to be on the NYT's best seller list!!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Since &#34;Time Out of Mind&#34; each new studio album confirms that Dylan is one of the greatest song writers/poets/musicians of all time. From the first song to the last this album shows Dylan at the top of his game. I just now looked to see if I might mention one or two songs that stand out, but they ALL stand out!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I had seen this in the theater and loved it.  I got it for a friend who had seen it with me and I knew she would watch it again and again for a good laugh.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't write movie reviews becase I feel it is a matter of taste. I maybe caught 1 of these shows when it was on. I feel if this had been on cable rather than Fox broadcast it would have been a big hit. Please note there was a movie made later ( Serinity ) you should also get so you will not be left hanging. There are also 3 books just FYI.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a must play in the angry bird genre. You will not be disappointed in playing this game. Love it
B008J05EL8|2.0|in order to have the office suite you must purchase this app also which sucks you should be told this up front
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well worth your time.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a great story.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Lots of fun, favorite game to play on the tablet, spending lots of time involved with the game, Love it
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|not to bad for a plane game but could use a lot of improvement and blab blab blan balb blab
B003L77GH4|5.0|I am a big fan of twilight, and true blood on HBO, so I thought I would give this a try and I'm hooked, I even have my husband liking it!
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|this whole series is fantastic.  cant believe more people havent given five stars!  very adult violence.  interesting characters and nice long plot.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Holly Bible: It is a very easy way to read the bible. And it read to u. I really love it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was an enjoyable read.  The characters were surprisingly well written for this genre which was a nice change. Also, one of the better free books I've gotten on Amazon!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I enjoyed his style of beautifully written prose, which was set in England.  However, it wasn't exciting enough for me.  I didn't particularly like stories within stories, but the ending was clever.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This is the story of the background of the Tudor dynasty specifically King Henry VIII in the early 1500's in England.  Of course Season 1 is the beginning when he is already in charge.<br />I chose the rating of five for this Season because of (1) Content.  It presents the facts the good along with the bad. (2) Portrayal and acting is superb.  They are all believable characters and all seem to fit the role chosen for them.  (3) Costumes are authentic.  I love historical dramas and this one does not let you down.  (4) The filming is of pure HD quality.  The only thing I did not like is the portrayal of so much sex however this was probably correct for his character.<br />This reminds me alot of the Jane Austen films.<br />I would recommend this movie to all of those who like historical dramas.
B00000G3PA|5.0|ARMAGEDDON IS A MOVIE THAT COMES ALONG ONCE IN A WHILE BECAUSE THE STORY LOOKED SO REVEALING. BRUCE WILLIS AND BEN AFFLECK ARE REALLY ASTOUNDING ACTORS AND THE EMOTIONS THAT THEY PORTRAYED IN THIS MOVIE WAS JUST BRILLIANT. THE ACTION WAS WONDERFUL AND EVERY ACTOR HAD A ROLE THAT WAS RIGHT FOR THEM. OVERALL, ARMAGEDDON DESERVES GOOD CREDIT BECAUSE IT SHOWS YOU THE LOVE, HONOR, AND SACRIFICE THESE MEN HAD TO MAKE FOR THEIR COUNTRY. THEY WERE NOT CALLED HEROES FOR NOTHING.
B005723JSQ|1.0|through the whole book I had to laugh once. That's it... The rest of it was super boring and flat. Also, how lame is it to text someone who stands in the same room with you. Sounds more like early teenagers instead of a 29-year-old $13 is way overpriced for that
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is completely fun and cool. Once I start playing I do not want to stop. I'm very addicted to this game, it's not bad that I'm addicted, it's awesome. This game is amazing. Everyone should rate it five.
1576875776|5.0|This book is on permanent display at my home.  What an amazing photographer.  I am so glad that her lifes work is finally being shared as an inspiration to us all.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I absolutely loved the book and characters. It's definitely one of those books that keeps you wanting to keep reading
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy this game it has so much more detail than temple run and I play it all the time!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|So much of this account &#34;feels&#34; right (and I've never had an NDE) but there just seems to be so much attempt to sensationalize, or rationalize, or expand on it using human metaphors, etc. that at times I'm more confused than edified. BUT... maybe that's just how it is when such an amazing thing has happened. Dr. Alexander does allude to just such a difficulty in explaining his NDE but at times all the extraneous descriptions of his life, while meant to clarify, at times seem to muddle the narrative... at least for me. The book is worthy of a read, though, so download it and enjoy.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The bond movies were so fake and cartoony in the past. This is a James Bond without phony equipment and an invincible attitude. Daniel Craig plays a very human and vulnerable but very tough James Bond. Watch it and see what i mean. I guarantee you will love this movie!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book. It was very good. I would be glad to recommend it to anybody who wants to read it.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I  have read this book straight on from the first . Really enjoyed it and am waiting patiently for the next in the series. Recommend but read the first book to start with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it it is so fun I like how the place changes every so often and u have daily challenges. I love it and would recamend it to my friends:)
B0070YDOT8|5.0|Ahh urs so far so good. I really jus started playin its cool so far. Im really gettin into it so that's a plus!!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Baldacci never<br /><br /> fails to keep the reader on their toes with every page. Great suspense,  challenging theories, and incredible storylines . Great read as always. Would love to go to a book signing.
B008BU70HW|5.0|Not only informative, it made me feel like part of both families, above and below the stairs. Keep up the great work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game! They just can't get enough of it,I picked it up one day to check it out and have been addicted ever since.
B007HACDLK|4.0|An exciting fast paced story about the CIA and FBI in Afghanistan.  It was hard to put down.  A typical Mitch Rapp book.  Highly recommended.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like how it lets me know how much time I have to play games, web, etc. I recommend this. 5/5
B00006JIA4|5.0|I LOVE this set--this is my 3rd purchase of this set because I wore out the first two. This time I received a fantastic price for a CD that included an MP3 recording. It's super music to listen to while commuting.
0793563836|4.0|I update my instructional material from time to time as it is essential to stay current with methods and media.  This electric bass compilation helps and is one I recommend to my students.  A typical range of students includes (for example) 10 year old beginning guitarists,  a few teen guitarists who have been playing a while to a few beginning bassists, and some crossover bassists from piano & guitar.  I choose this method for the bassists as good standard from which to start and to bring the student through 3 levels of musicianship.<br /><br />But this method is not all I employ in the course of instruction.  I also work the students out on dexterity exercises which include: Symmetrical and Chromatic exercises.  Liner scalar sequences, positional scalar sequences, arpeggios, legato techniques, thumbs, pops etc...<br /><br />This series provides a measurable standard of advancement realizing of course that much of the work bringing a student up in technique is done in conjunction with other resources as well.  This approach adds to the enjoyment of learning for the student and really pays off when the dexterity kicks in and suddenly things become much easier to accomplish and then the student derives great satisfaction inside the learning process.<br /><br />My goals are to advance the students playing (and jamming) and this series is a wonderful aid in reaching those milestones.<br /><br />Good price too.  If you are familiar with instruments/music/strings I guess you could give a go by yourself.  I certainly did that decades ago, but back then all we had was Mel Bay and Mary Had a Little Lamb types of instruction available.  This is so far beyond that.  Ed Friedland has authored a nice package.<br /><br />If could make one more small suggestion it would be to take some drum lessons as well as some piano; you'll be glad you did.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|My wife and I both enjoyed pitch perfect. The movie didn't take itself too seriously and the jokes and singing were all great.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|Can't believe how good this game is, don't think it's just for kids. Well made and cute to look at and play<br />GREAT JOB Playmobil.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Regret I haven't  known about T&S till I got Amazon's MP3 e-mail. Pretty jacket and $5.-. I immediately ordered to try it without any research, getting album in a minute.  I realized it was a great finding of new artists and music I like.  I feel lucky that I am subscribed  in Amazon's MP3 news.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It surprised me a few times, especially the bunny carcasses chapter.  :)<br /><br />It does make me wish i loved running as mauch as everyone in the book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is my kind of game. It is fun and intriguing. The only problem I have is that it takes up so much space on my kindle fire. This made it run slower. Otherwise I have really enjoyed the game very much.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Loved this and watching with amazon prime is easy. I recommend this. It is very convenient and also very fun.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I have never been more  interested or intrigued by a book in my life. I read it in.  Matter if days and was completely upset when it was over.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Loved this and watching with amazon prime is easy. I recommend this. It is very convenient and also very fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun solitaire game.When you have a few minutes to kill, this works great, especially for the price. I would suggest getting this app if you spent hours playing solitaire on Windows.
B005544V6A|5.0|Loved this and watching with amazon prime is easy. I recommend this. It is very convenient and also very fun.
B00336G7HI|5.0|It has met my expectations fully just as the originally supplied batter did. Has a long run time on a flash memory storage video camera.
B00AJRKR3Y|5.0|I'm always amazed on the depth of creativity and style he finds, Another extremely enjoyable palette of offerings with some very memorable tracks. ALways looking forward to seeing him live.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|The brother sister thing is really awkward to me. It didn't leave  me with an urgency to read the next book.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Once I started reading this book I could not put it down and could not read it fast enough. Funny, yet moving at the same time. Lines are laugh out loud funny. I haven't enjoyed a book more in many years - not since 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society'. My only complaint - it's the author's 1st book so I don't know how long I will need to wait for his next!! I do not go out of my way to recommend books but I am certainly spreading the word about this one.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I LIKE THE FACT THAT THIS CASE &#34;PROPS UP&#34; THE TABLET FOR EASY VIEWING AND READING.  IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASILY FITS IN MY PURSE.  IT'S EASY TO WIPE CLEAN.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The story matched the wonderful graphics!  Haven't seen a story this well developed and beautiful to watch since the old Disney movies.  Fantastic!
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I love this series and I especially appreciate getting it on my Kindle with my Prime Membership.  Great picture and Audio.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|For $2.99 it was a no-brainer to try this out. I really enjoyed the whole album (download). It's just one of those good beat, good rock albums that really is consistently good from start to finish. I just can't believe that we are at a point in time where we are lucky enough to enjoy great music for such low prices. Thanks Amazon!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome app!!! You can get with several plans to read the Bible all the way through in weeks!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Totally blown away by the ending..great read!<br />as  parents we usually  live in denial that our child/children can do wrong.
B004SIP6QI|2.0|I choose this rating because when we played the video it skipped and the visual broke up in several places. It was a surprise gift for my husband who loves this movie. Imagine our disappointment when we played it and had that experience. It will play on our computer in the wide screen version, but the TV version does not play smoothly. We tried other movies to make sure it was not our DVD player causing the problem, but all played fine. I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This is a great soundtrack! I'll agree that \\"No Diggity\\" sounds different and it would have been nice to get entire versions of the songs from the riff-off but, other than that, it's perfect!
B00081U7HC|5.0|I love the movie Pretty Woman and wanted to get it on DVD. When we received it we played it that night. I was pleasently surprised to notice that there were several added scenes to the movie that improved it greatly. I would recommend it to anyone who loved the movie and/or are fans of Julia Roberts or Richard Gear! It was awesome. The DVD played with not problems just the way I would expect any purchase to do.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|I found the movie fairly true to the book version. Slow movie but worth watching. I would recommend it to my friends.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable that came with my Kindle deteriorated with storage and use, shedded whit e &#34;crumbs&#34; until I gave up and faced paying almost $20 for a replacement cable.  Would that qualify it as defective, poor quality, or...what?  Naturally, I love the new one I review above.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I found the movie to be very well put together. The actors played their roles perfectly. It kept me interested throughout. Highly recommended.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|It had some good action sequences especially if you like wired martial arts and like most Tarantino movies, a lot of blood!  There wasn't much of plot, but was fairly entertaining.  I did really like the armor and weapons the characters used.  If you are looking for an action packed martial arts movie this would work!
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Freaking awesome music, will be buying more!!!!  play this cd all the time~~~ you can't go wrong at all!  already on my ipod!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked how it was written and the strong character development. I definitely recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I chose the game because it is familiar to me.  The game is a challenge but the interruptions to consider other games are totally unwantd.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought the book was so interesting and unpredictable.  I would recommend it to women who have gone through sexual abuse by a family member, or women who have been adopted. The book could be very therapeutic for them.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I would give it five star because it is a great game but after turning your Kindle fire (first edition) and back on it won't load!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was my first Mitch Rapp book and I'm hooked! Lots of suspense and action. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys a good spy mystery.
B006T4NQNO|4.0|My wife wanted a protective lens cover for her new camera. This adapter ring fits perfectly on her camera and she is very pleased to know her lens will be protected from the dust and elements. The adapter fits the grooves in the camera very well but doesn't lock when twisted on. You can over twist the ring at which point it looses up. You should be able to twist it far enough to keep it from falling off entirely.
B00AJLHULW|2.0|This album contains no real new work by Robben Ford.  Just alot of typical jazz rock-nice guitar solos and organ solos.  Vocals are good by Robben but uninspired.  No real track stands out except maybe the first two.  After that it is downhill.  Same old Robben.  He is a great guitar player and good singer but I wish he would take off and rock soon.  Also play some real souled blues like he used to do.  This cd got a few playings and I filed it away.  Approach with caution. Nothing new here.  Too bad.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|every time I play if keeps going back the home page tot kindle fire so I am trying to fix it but over all it is a fun game
1848321600|5.0|Clear and concise with excellent photos and text. I recommend it to any person requiring detailed information about the development of the British Sailing Frigate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome game soo fun flfu fhjf gfjf dhdgd hfvdhd jdhgd fjdnvdbjd jdvjdd dbdbdjd eudjd fbdnd  idhhdkxbz jdbdb jdbcncb such a fun gamelol
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have seen the movie a couple of times. The book in my opinion is better. I really enjoyed reading about the the Japanese of the Shogun ruling era. I give this book a big thumbs up......
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I purchased this in the Blu-Ray version for my friend who recently bought a Blu-Ray player and he had seen this movie in the theatre and welcomed the chance to make this among his first Blu-Ray purchases.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Missed it on PBS but luckily it was here.  Loved the episode and the quality of the show was great in HD.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|This is another title that I purchased for a friend who just recently got a Blu-Ray player. He had enjoyed seeing this movie in the theatre and welcomed the chance to add it to his Blu-Ray collection.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I could not put it down. Wonderful!  I thought the writer knew how to keep the story moving and the characters were interesting.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|My friend had loved this movie last year and said it was his favorite film of the year so I wanted to get this title for him as soon as it was available in the Blu-Ray format.
B0001I55SS|3.0|movie is good, but would like to be able to purchase regular format instead of letterbox,,some people don't have choice to screen size.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this hand with a passion. I even gave up the temple run brave and subway surf for it. This is a must get app to all!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best because you get to take care of your horse and ride your horse and etc .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love Downton Abbey. And, we love that it's available on-demand via Amazon...free because we have Amazon Prime. However, the download time takes longer than Netflix...
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is awesome! Perry is so cool! I love how Carl talks to you! he is sp funny! great on kindle fire! worth 1$!get this app! so fun!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think I am going to like this game. I am only on level three but it seems interesting to me.
B00422LESO|3.0|I love Austen and her perpetual scrutiny of society as we blunder to find happy endings in the most basic of life's quandaries: who to love and marry.<br /><br />But sadly this isn't written by Austen.  This reads more like P. G. Wodehouse, but lacking the wit that made him brilliant.<br /><br />We get Jane's (the heroine) angst as she plods along in her epic search for the perfect man.  In her mind he is Mark Darcy.  Not any Mark Darcy will do, no she must have the BBC version immortalized by Colin Firth.<br /><br />We hear her sad chronology of failed relationships, but never seem to really care.<br />How is she the victim?  Her entire focus is on what she wants in and from a man.  I wasn't able to see what she brought to the table beyond her own expectations.  She pants for the gardener, pouts when it's over, and paints in her room.<br /><br />Others mentioned this is a new genre for this author.<br />If that's true then it explains a lot.<br />I think she's in a little over her head.<br /><br />This book made me recall the genius of Austen; my old copy of Emma is on the nightstand---again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We love all the angry birds games and this is no different. It is so much fun to play and my five-year-old can't get enough of this one.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This book was free on Kindle about the time the movie came out, so I thought I would read it.  I just finished it today.  I don't believe I'm qualified to give a \\"classic\\" a bad review -- but I must.  The story was interesting.  About 3/4 of the way through, I decided to read the reviews to see what others thought about it. They were mostly rave reviews, as in \\"don't die without reading this book.\\"  So I labored on.  I waded through much detail about the French Revolution with Napoleon, a lot of detail about the streets and sections of Paris, 3 full chapters on the sewers of Paris, past, present, and future.  And then more painful detail about the disturbance in the minds of the two main men characters.  The main woman character had, apparently, very little in her mind; it appears women of that time did not have the fine intelligence of men. By the time I got through the sewers, there was still a long way to go to get to the mostly foreseeable end.  I am sorry I spent so much of my time reading this book (I could have possibly read six good books during this time) -- as other readers suggested -- \\"every word of it.\\"  I found very few pearls of wisdom.  Definitely a very \\"wordy\\" book.  I did see the play years ago and remember little of it.  I believe I'll pass on the movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is really fun and somewhat addictive. I liek the different game mode so you can play according to how attentive you really are. So simple to play and anyone can play it.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Great series that always leaves you wanting more. Too bad that Amazon Instant Play is not available for Android. Other than that, the series is amazing.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|whats the point i would rather be board than play this stupid game i would give it 0 stars if possible its for old people
B004OC07F8|2.0|This book is for anyone who is new to the methodology of blue ocean strategy. Since I have read a few books and studied strategy and innovation, it didn't really give me any new input. On the other hand, blue ocean strategy is a useful tool among many others, so it can be a fair start.
B009ME47H2|3.0|handy i like to sing and record it but i sound weird because people say i have a great voice but i sound weird very easy to use i like how it glides to what you want recomended
B007VUCAVO|5.0|great app which accurately lets me know the amount of time left for different activities. the app is reliable, easy to use and unobtrusive.
B000VZYPB4|4.0|i really love this show! The main characters have wonderful chemistry and the writers are genius!  i enjoyed the first season the most but the others are good as well. i would recommend this show for those who love a good comedy
0802473156|5.0|Excellent! It met every expectation. I taught a class with this book and the participants were overjoyed with what they learned.
B005H29GSI|4.0|I like it even thogh the TNT in't the best, very good toy . I am using it's parts as a wall.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely a good book that will keep you guessing up to the very end! Very suspenseful. A great read! Thanks.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|I LIKE BEING ABLE TO CREATE DIFFERENT NOTEBOOKS FOR VARIOUS SUBJECTS. AS A NOTE ORGANISER FOR CLASSES, SPIRITUAL DIARY OR PERSONAL JOURNAL THIS IS JUST RIGHT.  ONCE INSIDE A BOOK THE INTERFACE IS EASY TO USE.  THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS TO PERSONALISE YOUR WORK AND USEFUL EXPANSION PACKS TO DOWNLOAD.  HOWEVER I AM LOOKING FOR A CALENDER SO I CAN USE THE LARGER SCREENED KINDLE INSTEAD OF MY PHONE AND DON'T FIND THESE TEMPLATES EASY.  THE HELP SECTION NEEDS UPDATING TO EXPLAIN HOW TO BACKUP MY WORK.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  There was a lot of predictable areas to the book but the ending I didn't see coming.  Suffice to say that I was amazed at a plot twist revealed at the end of the book and I am usually pretty good at picking up on things that seem out of place in a book.  I would recommend this as a stay in the house on a cold day or sit on a warm beach read.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Now this is a good movie. It's so out of the ordinary. I just love it. The shipment was faster than expected. If you are considering this movie I seriously recommend it.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Lacking in the technical detail and precision of facts that Clancy is known for, I an only guess the majority was written by Greaney.  This almost felt like one of the NetForce or Ghost Recon books that others have written in Clancy's past.<br /><br />While the story line is good (and the threat plausible), the mechanics of the whole thing seemed... Stilted.<br /><br />This may not be the last Jack Ryan novel ill buy, but its the last I'll pay a hardcover price for.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|The case is great, but I find it not very useful for myself as  have the model that comes with the USB adapter. Plus my headset came with one that has a pocket for the USB adapter. So, I don't use it at all.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Great product works well now after several updates. Tried 2 other products this work the best of the three products.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I use it for morning meditation and really like the many different sound options.  From chants to music to nature, it allows those of us with very &quot;busy&quot; minds to focus on the sounds.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|I can't necessarily say that I enjoyed reading this book, because there are so many gruesome details, but this book was incredibly moving and it changed my outlook on like. As you are reading this book you feel as if you are actually going on the journey and growing up with these characters. This book isn't for eveyone, but if you are interested in autobiographies and historical novels, this book is definitely for you!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Installed on galaxy s3. I play this game fairly regularly. I have never won on random draw. To play a winning draw, you must be served an ad. So if your data is turned off, the game is frustrating. Otherwise this one is ok.
B009FA98JU|3.0|The apple mini display port to dvi adapter does connect to my macbook pro easily.  However it is not a tight connection.  I would have expected better since this is actually an apple product.
B000F3T3CS|4.0|This is a fine performance by Anna Netrebko, as she was a number of years ago,  Actually, her talent has increased with time, but this performance is really spectacular.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|So good. Getting increasingly more dramatic. My only wish is that the crawler family could savor their few moments of happiness before the drama drives the plot forward.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Although not one of my favorites by Mr. Grisham it was a pleasuable read. Fast paced, easy. I would recommend.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Loved reading about the relationship between the  two characters.  I'd compare it to the 50 Shades Trilogy.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|I am one of those people who likes to know when it's a full moon, etc.  This is a good app for that..........or when the next full or new moon will be occuring.  Plus, I enjoy the Waxing & Waning part, too.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|ONLY USE FOR SWITCHING FROM CREATIVE TO SURVIVAL. Make on the free version, make it be able to spawn mobs. Don't have 2 apps that are different by one thing.
B004M8S2X8|5.0|A book you cannot put down- I gave it 5 stars because a) I get totally absorbed and immersed in John Greens books  b) It was a lot of symbology and metaphors c) The book was deep and emotional<br />Suitable for serious readers
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|EPICNESS UNNAPOSED!!!!! Just one thing: make every Dragon money, not gems. PS:  kairos: what  does does it look like???<br />PPS: air shouldn't be gems.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Loved every minute of this film.. Very entertaining and loved the way they brought him up to date.  I would recommend this to any Bond fan.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Awesome, but glitches up so bad I can't really ever play it. It is fun and the point is good, but it is way too glitchy
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A beautifully written story about two families' interconnections. A true piece of art and suspenseful narration make this a page turner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is epic. Please add: buckets, enchanting tables, the ability to actually set blocks on fire, ghasts, blazes, potions, enderman, slimes, villages, villagers, anvils, and make  multiplayer to be started on an android device. Please and thank you. Ps. Get wolves and ocelots
B0062P3392|5.0|Another one of my favorite actors: Jason Statham.  In this film, Jason plays a good guy.  He works with DeNiro and they are after a sadist killer.  This is a very good action movie.  If I give too much details it will spoil the movie for everyone so buy or rent this movie and watch it.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|hollywood messed up, this time they did a excellant job with this remake, over all i think this remake is better than the orginal one with arnold, watch for some of the old lines to appear very funny indeed. the plot was excellent, the charaters just as good, and the acting was marvelous. i recommand rent/buy the 1st and 2nd total recalls watch the orginal 1st then the remake 2nd for total enjoyment.
B002ZG999U|5.0|One heck of a good movie. Jason Statham, Jet Li, Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts just to name a few of the actors involved in this movie.  They are sent by a secret organization to a small country to overthrow the dictator but find out it is really someone else they must get rid of. If I tell more it will apoil it for everyone.  This movie is a very good action movie and is well worth watching.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|When I got this app it only let me take one video and then just shuts off every time I try to take a video
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I first saw this movie on TV and loved it.  I watched it every time it came on, but then as usual they took it off.  I had almost forgotten about it until I was looking on Amazon and came across it.  I had to have it for my collection.<br />Percy is the son of Posiden (boy those guys must have been busy)and has been blamed by Zeus for stealing his Lightning bolt.  Zeus will destroy the world if his bolt is not returned in 10 days.  The rest of the movie is not stop action as Percy and his friends look for the bolt.  A good family film but not for kids under 12.
1419705849|4.0|good book, not the best diary of a wimpy kid book. its almost all about greg trying to get a date in it gets boring.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Hubby loves the show so I've been getting the seasons for him as gifts lately.<br />Well made and has some nice additional materials like the past seasons.<br />Good price even with shipping.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know this might be a lot of money, but it's TOTALLY WORTH IT. There are two modes, Creative and Survival. In Survival Mode, you have to mine blocks to get resources and craft stuff in the Crafting Table.<br /><br />At night monsters spawn and there is a Skeleton(fires arrows at you), it drops arrows and bones and a rare drop is a used bow. There is a Creeper(blows up in your face), it drops gunpowder. There is a Zombie(eats your BRAINS), it drops feathers. And lastly, there is the Spider(climbs walls and jumps on you), it drops string.<br /><br />In Creative Mode, you have unlimited blocks and there is no nighttime. You can fly, and you have no lives, so you can live infinitely. You can jump off the highest tower and not get hurt at all. You can even play multiplayer(Creative or Survival Mode) so you can play with your friends. I hope every one that reads my review thinks it was helpful. PLEASE GET THIS GAME!!!! IT'S DA BOMB!!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Love the whole movie. Have waiting for it to come out on DVD so I can buy for myself. Its great!
B009JZOOKO|4.0|This movie was a great movie I recommend watching this movie.  This was a great buy! Great movie go out and buy yourself a copy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I usually highlight something's faults because if I can forgive the faults then I can love it. I love the book. It can get depressing. It can feel like Katniss should make up her mind a little sooner, and it can feel like the book switched gears a bit abruptly from the tone of the other books and even from the tone of the first half of this one, but the book does a wonderful job with nearly everything else and especially with concluding the trilogy.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Enticing story for not only halo fans but all readers. The resolution never was given away and various twists and turns kept me hooked the entire time.
B00BESLT6G|4.0|Silent Hill: Revelation understands the heart if the classic horror video game it is based on even better than its predecessor. I would not recommend watching this alone at night. Perhaps the franchise's current game developers should watch this to brink them back to the simple yet drop terror that was so lacking in the most recent game release.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|It's a continuation, so if u read the first book, u will also ready the last. I found it very relaxing.
0385344333|4.0|This was great, but I don't  think it was one of his best.  However, as usual I<br />read it in two nights.  Can't put them down.
B008M721MS|5.0|i love to speak with my friends anytime and anywhere.! the mic is awesome and also the speakers of my kindle
B000UZNRS2|5.0|B<br /><br />A real page turner. Makes one owner what really goes on  behind closed doors in the white house and  Pentagon
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have enjoyed Downton for all three seasons now, and can hardly wait for the next episode to be released. Its been interesting to see this era in our history portrayed.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I had low expectations for this since it was free, but i was pleasantly surprised by the quality. If you enjoyed Mario bros., than you will enjoy this game too.
B001GA1RFA|4.0|Very Enjoyable.  Like Mr. Green's other books, this is a quick, easy read, with a wealth of truth and humor that any good teen fiction should contain.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read book one and two, had the need to read on he see what happen next.  Recommend the Hold three books for enjoyable reading.  A book that is hard to put down.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I screened the film &#34;The Girl&#34; about a month or two ago, a film that I really liked.  Perhaps even liked more than &#34;Hitchcock,&#34; although it is closer than I thought it would be.<br /><br />Toby Jones gave an amazing performance as Afred Hitchcock in &#34;The Girl,&#34; which wasn't completely surprising after I watched the movie &#34;Infamous,&#34; a film that I recommend over both of these by a bit.  In &#34;Infamous,&#34; Mr. Jones outdid Philip Seymour Hoffman in &#34;Capote&#34; and as Capote, which was a surprise to me.  At any rate, I wanted to compare Anthony Hopkins interpretation of Mr. Hitchcock to Mr. Jones', and surely neither disappoints.  While I have an opinion on who &#34;won,&#34; it was so close really that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />This film though is a more sympathetic take on Hitchcock than &#34;The Girl.&#34;  In that film, Mr. Hitchcock's legacy takes quite a beating, although Mr. Jones played him so well that it was still really good.  Here, Mr. Hitchcock is surely treated with more respect, although he is still shown as a flawed character.  Which film did I like better?  Well, once again, I have an opinion but it is so close it doesn't matter.<br /><br />One minor compaint:  the character listing seems to bury Toni Collette, although it prominently features Scarlett Johansson.  In my opinion, Ms. Collette is a better actress -- she really doesn't get the kudos that she so often deserves -- and this bothered me a bit.  However, Ms. Johansson, whom I've been a little hit-and-miss on over her career (I still like her the best in &#34;The Horse Whisperer&#34; and &#34;Lost in Translation&#34;), was actually an excellent casting choice here.<br /><br />I highly recommend both of these films about Mr. Hitchcock.  And if you like &#34;The Girl&#34; then I really recommend &#34;Infamous.&#34;  You'll probably like that film about another flawed character-- Mr. Capote -- the most of the three.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read a review that said book 2 and 3 weren't as good as one what a load of crap the entire series was fantastic hard to put down.  I stayed up late a couple nights in a row for these book's .i hope the author is working on a new series what a talent.
B0071AKB38|5.0|Since I decided to try out the 4 more popular bluetooth mini-speakers on Amazon, I might as well write a review comparing the 4.  The four that I decided to compare are:<br /><br />DBEST London Duo Bluetooth Rechargeable Mini-Speaker Set (PS4003BT-RB)<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JO1YCY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1<br /><br />X-Mini KAI XAM11-B Bluetooth Capsule Speaker<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071AKB38/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Accessorise (TM) Portable Bluetooth Wireless Mini Speaker System<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GP92SG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Alpatronix AX300 X-tra Strong Bluetooth Portable Mini Capsule Speaker<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062CBCGG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Based on testing it with 4 different songs on YouTube, here are my ratings and quick comments:<br /><br />Darude Sandstorm:<br />DBest - 8 - strong sound, good bass, not too much distortion<br />Alphatronix - 4 - weakest volume and sound out of the 4, also a constant buzz can be heard when connected<br />Accessorise - 7 - WOW, this thing is surprisingly loud and the bass isn't too bad<br />X-Mini - 10 - by far the best out of the 4, strongest base, clearest sound without distortion<br /><br />Palladio (the Diamond Commercial song):<br />DBest - 6 - good volume, but when it comes to classical stuff, the sound was a little screechy and not as warm<br />Alphatronix - 3 - poor volume, weak sound, and it just sounded bad.  The buzz was still there<br />Accessorise - 7 - good volume, a bit more &#34;raw&#34; than DBest, but less screechy, so I gave it a higher score.<br />X-Mini - 9 - again the clear winner with a rounded sound, good volume, and low distortion.  Warmest sound of them all.<br /><br />Zombie Nation:<br />DBest - 6 - the strong bass in this piece caused a bit of distortion and made the song a bit painful to bear<br />Alphatronix - I took this out of the running by this point.<br />Accessorise - 8 - Impressively loud, and while there were distortions, it was strong enough to make me ignore it<br />X-Mini - 9 - again the winner, but not by much compared to Accessorise.  Maybe because of the power of Accessorise really helped it in this song.<br /><br />Handel/Halvorssen's Passagcaglia (Perlman/Zucherman live in Russia version):<br />DBest - 7 - good, but the high violin notes made it screechy again.<br />Accessorise - 8 - slightly better than DBest, and slightly less screechy<br />X-Mini - 9 - warmest and most rounded of the sounds.  Least screechy and you can hear the details the best.<br /><br />Mozart Violin Sonata in e minor (Gil Shaham):<br />DBest - I took it out of the running because the price is double Accessorise and performance is similar.<br />Accessorise - 8 - clear, warm, and strong volume<br />X-Mini - 10 - especially at the 8:56 point, the violin comes through powerful, smooth, yet warm.  Impressive!<br /><br />So ultimately, I rank these four speakers this way:<br />1. X-Mini<br />2. Accessorise<br />3. DBest<br />4. Alphatronix<br /><br />The question I face was whether X-mini commanded the 2.5x price premium.  At the point in writing this review, I'm still debating, so I may play with both of them a little more before deciding.  But the value of Accessorise could win me over just because of how cheap it is, but I could also splurge for the best quality out of the 4 with X-Mini.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the X-Mini does jump around the table with strong bass, but the way to solve it (though sacrificing some bass) is to close the speaker (shrink it) or put it on a soft surface where it can't bounce off.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful for everyone!<br /><br />Cheers!he running by this point.<br />Accessorise - 8 - Impressively loud, and while there were distortions, it was strong enough to make me ignore it<br />X-Mini - 9 - again the winner, but not by much compared to Accessorise.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was new to Downton.  Actually watched the first two seasons on my Kindle  and was absolutely enthralled.  The third season was amazing and wonderful and heartbreaking all at once.  The best thing I have EVER watched on TV.  Don't know how I can wait until Four!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Usually Clancy's books start off with a lot of acronyms and military detail. It seems to me he couldn't wait for the reader to get started in on the action. Very exciting and kept me interested until the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game that I have ever played before I love this game it is so much better than playing temple run.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I'm a musician (50+ years) so am probably have a better perception of what &#34;live&#34; or &#34;real&#34; sounds like than your average &#34;Joe&#34;.  I thought my PC playback and Bose QC 15 headphones sounded really good...until I listened to them using the FiiO E17 as the &#34;sound card&#34;!  WOW!  What a noticeable improvement in sound quality and clarity!!!  My son bought this device first...and I heard the difference it made with the expensive (e.g. $500) headphones he uses...comparing with/without so decided to buy one for myself.  To be honest...I was a little skeptical, but now have no doubt this was a great buy...and I'm not using the full digital side yet...have to wait until I get the parts I need to use the &#34;spidf&#34; connection then I can up the quality to 96kbit!  If you love music and really want to hear what has been recorded...then I would suggest you &#34;must&#34; buy this unit.  If you're happy with 128k mp3 files, then  you'll probably not care so don't waste your money.  The device is small but amazingly powerful and truly does upgrade the quality noticeably!  I use it for &#34;jazz track&#34; playback on my MacBook into my Bose PA system and for cacual listening via my office PC speakers and headphones.  All sound a LOT better!  Great buy and a fair price for a device that actually makes a difference!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it so much its free it gives facts and you can unlock new blades its rocks my whole family loves it
B00BHNRZS4|5.0|Revenge takes on many forms in this show.  The main character, Emily Thorne (aka Amanda Clarke) seeks vengeance against the Graysons for the frame job they did on her father for a terrorist act.  The terrorist organization, The Initiative, has played a large role in the second season.  The twists are constant in this show, the actors are all great, and there's a depth of feeling between the characters.  It feels like the TV equivalent of a page-turner.  Just love it!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I could read this book over and over and over! Extremely attention grabbing and I find it hard to put down.
161176064X|5.0|We enjoy books on long drives. It takes you mind off the length of the trip and stupid drivers. ha! Very interesting story and funny in parts. If you had children with you it might train their ears to listen and visualize. I have another Theodore Boone ready for the next trip this coming weekend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it play it daily.love the real look great application recommend to all even adults. its addicting and its a awesome app
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Game is just the right level of challenge for casual play.  Nice graphics and interesting puzzles at ends of stages.
B007REV4YI|1.0|We are sad to report that James Bond is apparently missing in action, and presumed dead.  I don't blame Daniel Craig for this, i'm sure he's doing the best he can with the garbage they give him to work with.  Skyfall is so boring and dull, it makes A View to a Kill seem quite lively, the latter being my only other disappointment in the franchise.  Q's gadgets, a radio and a gun that only shoots for Bond.  Give me a break, if Bond lets his weapon get taken from him, he deserves to be shot.  Although the argument could be made that the gun is actually useless for Bond anyway, the former expert marksman now can't hit anything, he'd do better to throw the gun.  The Bond franchise isn't meant to be about a policeman that plods around solving crimes and chasing bad guys.  It's about a superman like being with powerful gadgets at his disposal, pretty girls all around, and shaken not stirred.  It looks like Craig is slated already for the next Bond movie, i suppose the only thing to do now is to boycott the studio, this guy is incredibly awful as Bond.  I do realize the purpose of these movies are to make money, but still, do they need to be so greedy about their profits that they can't put some amount of craft into their production?
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|The book has suspense and a good story line, with excellent depth in terms of the weary and foot slogging way investigations are done.
B008476HBM|5.0|Classic Book!  Great to have it on my Kindle and ready to read whenever I want.  If you haven't read this novel yet, you're missing out!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|The game is a pretty decent run of search games with a few puzzles thrown for good measure.  Fairly quick play, and it looks like there's a follow-up I can dive right into.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|just like the arcade game. My only complaint is waiting for the coins to build back up once you have used them all. Unless you want to PURCHASE more with your own money.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|bought this game because I love other games by them on my Mac.  Element has vividly graphics for my retinal screen. had no idea Kindle graphics were so good till this game.
B00271HAK8|5.0|This movie is an excellent classic. One of Matthew Broderick best films....ever.  Mr. Rooney is absolutely hilarious. Makes me wish I had a Ferrari :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I will say this book was an extremely fast read. This book in my opinion isn't as good as the 1st or 3rd ones but this is a perfect bridge between them
0385721234|5.0|I bought this book because I have to improve my Spanish and I just love the story, very well written.
B00881VLCE|3.0|this game, when it WORKS, is terrific. I could play it for hours on end. it's a lot of fun
B008XG1X18|4.0|It is not as easy to navigate as the website, and I found pinning more confusing initially, but it is still awesome to have access to my favorite site when I am away from my home computer
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun game, very addicting.<br />i am required to write all these words in order to submit my review, so i hope you like them :)
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Haven't received it yet, but this series is fantastic.  You've got to watch this!  Started watching this series during season two so can't wait for this to arrive.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a great book. Shows the humanity, honor and chivalry of the German pilots. Extremely well researched and crafted. I will read this book again. WWII \\"history\\" has been distorted in many ways. This seems an honest account.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I never got to see the first season so I ordered it to get the background story of the series.  I have seen half of season two and have watched the rest of the seasons up to season five.  Can't wait to get this and waiting for season six to start some time this year.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Was an awesome read and I really enjoyed it. Though this ends so that there might be another. Can't wait to read more
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I saw the first season on HBO and loved it so much that I had to have the whole season on blu-ray.  I even went so far as to buy the four book boxed set.  I watched this again recently so that I could keep the images and story fresh in my mind.  I just received Season Two and starting to watch it for a refresher before Season Three starts next month.  This is a great show!  If you like stories from medieval times with kings and queens and kingdoms that are attacking each other...  I do recommend this first season.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|This is a very useful and inexpensive add-on to the purchase of the  ONKYO TX NR-616 AV receiver. if you are purchasing the 616 you will regret not ordering this adapter. It works exactly as advertised. Without it you are missing a feature  though not required is very useful. For those times you want to connect your smart phone or pad directly to the unit over Bluetooth in order to stream your contents to the receiver, it is a must.<br /><br />MunseyMusic.com
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Just a big fan of this show/series.  A neighbor introduced me to this show and now I am hooked on it.  This series is a must-see.
B0088W6DPI|5.0|I loved SG1 and somehow I think Atlantis is my favorite of the 3 Stargate series (did not like SGU at all).  Some of my favorites were in this season, \\"Common Ground\\", \\"The Tao of Rodney\\" (wow McCay has a nice side when he thinks he's going to die, and of course, \\"The Return\\"  both parts.  Not a lot of people liked the return of the Replicators, but they are different in this galaxy and I loved O'Neill's usual hilariousness and his back and forth with Woolsey.  I was devastated with Carson, and I can't watch the episode \\"Sunday\\" anymore (Yes, I've watched this series probably 5 times). But glad that we're (probably) done with Elizabeth.  Ugh.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|The ALIEN movie series began as a stunner (Alien), led to a great action movie (Aliens), then slid into fair effects, dismal sets and lighting, and some plot silliness in both Alien 3 and Alien 4.<br />Although not presented as a true prequel, Prometheus imagines some interesting origins for the full storyline, and utilizes well-done special effects. The only thing I found rather unlikely was the lead character, played by Noomi Rapace, doing remarkable athletic stunts right after having doing a major operation on herself! There are limits in suspending belief, even in a belief-suspending movie like Prometheus! But it's fun, none-the-less.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Like the tilt based user controls, and variety of goals. Might get old eventually, but hoping that new stuff like black cause fish continues to pop up.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This action movie picks up where the others in the series end.  It does not disappoint.  I'm looking forward to the next chapter in the Bourne saga.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is cool it is just like a really nice pony<br />I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really like it
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is a must-have for the collector of the Pixel animated stories.  These are always entertaining and something to watch again and again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was and amazing game to play has nothin inappropriate for kids so I would recommend for all ages it super fun and addictive
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I wasn't quite sure if I would like this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  There is something there for lovers of mixed genres.  It is as funny as it is terrifying.
0765325950|5.0|I am very happy with the way the book finished.  I think Brandon did a terrific job taking up the reins.  Shame on you to all the people leaving one star reviews because an ebook wasn't released at the same time.  If you loved the WOT series at all, it is a disgrace to do that to the original author's memory.  I own hardback and ebook copies of every book so far and will buy the ebook once it is released.  Again, you should all be ashamed of yourselves, you certainly can't be called fans any longer.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|First off, watch Undisputed II: Last Man Standing before seeing Undisputed III.  Now on to it, after seeing U2 it's hard to imagine Uri Boyka (Scott Adkins) as a sympathetic character but that's the direction of Boyka in Undisputed III, and it totally works.  Hence the title &#34;Redemption.&#34;<br /><br />The movie takes place some years after LMS.  Big, bad Boyka &#34;the most complete fighter in the world&#34; is now reduced to being &#34;champion of the toilets&#34; mopping up the prison's fecal matter.  The nasty leg injury from years ago still plagues him.  Boyka is denied parole due to his heinous crimes and won't be eligible for another 15 years.  He realizes the only way he'll ever be free is to fight again or die trying.  Boyka's chance at freedom comes in the form of a prison tournament featuring the best prison fighters from around the world.  The winner gets his freedom and the crime syndicate hosting the fights earns millions of dollars.  Of course things are never as they seem as the organizers have already chosen who they want to win.<br /><br />I gave Undisputed II 5 stars.  I would give this one 6 if I could.  Boyka is a very interesting character and Scott Adkins again does an amazing job.  What I think works so well in this movie is that you never really find out too much about the characters.  It leaves you wanting more.  Boyka's history is a complete mystery.  We know Turbo (Mykel Jenkins) was accused of a double murder, but it seems he's innocent or at least that's what I believe.  Mark Ivanir returns as the ever smarmy Gaga.  You can't help but like Gaga, and hopefully he'll be back for IV.  The acting in Redemption is much improved over LMS.  Everyone is believable in their roles.<br /><br />Many different styles of fighting are featured in this one and all the bouts are well choreographed.  Adkins and Marko Zaror, as the extra creepy Raul Quinones, do an outstanding job during the fights and training montages.  The action is top notch andnever quits.<br /><br />Buy this movie!  It's the best $5 dollars you will ever spend on Amazon.  I have seen it 6 times already, and it never gets old.  I only wish there had been some extra content on the DVD like behind the scenes, bloopers, and commentary.  I also wish they had marketed this movie better.  Hopefully Undisputed IV will be in the works.  There is still so much to learn about Uri Boyka.  I want more in your face action!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so cool. there is a zipline-a go cart and a normal place. I really recommend. this app for kids and parents.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel is just great... although i am not a fan of &#34;In pursuit of happiness&#34; type of films, but if that's you then you'll like this one.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I was not expecting to be so engaged with the story and characters. The movie was fun to watch and I had a smile on my face at the end.  It is a great movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Held your interest.  Now there is a movie.  Haven't seen it, but has to be good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the best teller run game ever. I think it is even better than subway surfers.besides this game is the original.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very easy read. Perfect pacing so you're never bored. Not a crazy amount of depth, which could be bad or good depending on the reader.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading this series in my 20's, now I am in my mid 40's, and I feel like I have been reading this series my entire life.  All I have to say is... THANK GOD they finished this after Robert Jordan died.<br /><br />Was I completely happy with the ending... na.  But at least there WAS an ending!<br /><br />My biggest gripe is how they just casually threw away major characters lives that they had spent litterally 100's of pages developing over the course of the series with hardly a mention (cough, cough, Siuan Sanche), got the sizes of the two armies so drastically wrong (especially the number of casters on the good side) and the unexplained drastic reduction in the effectiveness of casting in battle (especially the black tower guys), the insertion of a new massive enemy force hardly even mentioned prior to this - who fights to the death along side the trollics (huh? what's their motivation besides a forsaken having become their king to fight for basically Satan?)  Heck, those guys fought MUCH harder than the trollics which had to be constantly whipped to fight.<br /><br />But my biggest gripe of all was... what the hell is up with Rand just riding off into the sunset in anothers body (no explaination on how that was possible by the way)????  WHAT!?  um... so... you just knock up a couple of women and then take off right before the babies start popping out to live the simple life you've been longing for !?!?!<br /><br />BUT, after having said all that... I am SO FREAKING thankful that Sanderson finished this and gave me some closure.<br /><br />I honestly think this should get 3-4 stars, but I'll give it 5 to help balance out all the unfair 1 stars it got due to the e-book release issue.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This is an interesting game sorta temple run is better.I would advise getting Temple Run 2 instead.Well thats all bye
B009EEFTMC|5.0|fun to play and easy to use.  would pick this over many other programs any day/ Just need to remember when to quit
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this for my sister for christmas. It came very quick and she loved it, a good buy, cool music too.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|Was definitely worth spending the time to watch this movie. Great movie for all to see.  Being able to watch it instantly definitely helps as well
B007R41E8O|4.0|Really enojoyed it!  Kept my attention and figured it all out A great way to escape reality and a stress release.
B005IGZUTC|5.0|Great book, I love this series. Not as quick of a read as the first one. Still a great book thou.
1401924352|5.0|i brought this book for each of my grand daughters.  this author has good history of being able to speak to pre-teen and teen girls about self image.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I thought this movie was a little too drawn out. It dragged a lot longer than I think it should have.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 10 year old grandson plays this very much.  He loves it and enjoys building<br />He is constantly playing this game.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It's nice to watch a movie where it isn't always centered around sex, profanity and nudity. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|After reading some of the reviews about this app being scary, don't go in the woods, and don't turn around I thought I would give it a try.  I didn't find this app scary at all.  I thought it was just plain dumb.  There was always some warning when slender man was near or the screen would get &#34;snow&#34; on it.  This app was just not challenging enough for me or scary.
B00BISM9YI|5.0|Wish i had got the Season 1 Stark limited edition not sure if i wanna pay$120 for it but im sure glad i got this Blu Ray set love every minute of the show.
B00AGKHFCA|4.0|How many things do I need to say ?  He is a great singer and this is another group of wonderful recordings.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I have found this product to be very useful as an accurate indication of the battery condition of my Kindle fire which seems to run down very quickly compared with my original Kindle.
B004EARTN8|5.0|It was slow in places but the ending was totally worth it.  I thought it was a pretty good movie.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|It shows what other wifi signals are in your area, and what channel everyone else is using, plus the signal strength. Very good.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had it's twists and turns and it messes with your head. It's a good movie.
B00881VLCE|5.0|You should try this game it is kinda fun. You get to choose how many pieces and what picture you want to do.
B00114RKT8|5.0|The movie is wonderfully done. It is about slave trade: how difficult a change can be and possibly take a lifetime. Ioan Gruffudd is amazing in this movie; he even sings (well). I am glad I watched it; both entertaining and educating.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|good graphics and i am really enjoying the Game i would like to play more games like this its a good mystery game with hidden objects
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My grand daughter always had love animals so she saw the game and wanted to download. She love to play the game. Thanks!<br />Mary
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game you should get it because its very interactive and awesome you can also get unicorns and zebras so go get this app now
0070511136|5.0|SPIN is a great acronym, title and concept.  The methodology I found quite timely and will undoubtedly increase my performance and meet the needs for which I purchased the book.  Still, I think the author's examples should be updated to deal with technology in the second decade of the 21st Century.  We live in a vastly different world technologically speaking than we did in the late 1980s.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|You might have heard people advising you to adopt good habits and get rid of bad habits. You might have read countless self-help books which details how you can create new habits. In this book, the author Charles Duhigg tells the reader about what a habit is and how this knowledge has changed individuals, organizations and society.<br /><br />At the core, a habit can be broken down into three phases - cue, response and reward. This is the cycle of a habit. Many recent scientific studies have established this fact. Once you breaks down your habit into these three phases, you can change your habit easily. This is what Charles Duhigg tells the reader.<br /><br />The interesting thing about the book is the scientific studies related to the different phases in the habit cycle is told briskly and clearly in the beginning chapters itself. Once this cycle is established, Charles Duhigg chronicles many real life experiences as evidences of changing a habit by creating a new habit. The real life experiences of marketing Febreze, civil rights movements in USA etc are used to highlight the importance of habit.<br /><br />All of us struggle in changing bad habits and embracing good habits. This book serves as a good inspiration for all of us to understand and learn how to go about it. This is recommended to everyone. The real life experiences and the simplicity of narration will keep you engrossed in the book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I got this book not knowing what to expect. As it has turned out it's one of the best books I've ever read. It is very entertaining. I highly recommend this book, and as for Andy Weir I hope he does plenty more writing in his career/lifetime.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Good thing I decided to pick up another controller after I bought my used system. The USB charging port on my used controller is more than finicky. So much so that I don't even bother to tell people I have two. So kudos to sending me a new and working controller.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Both the audio and video are spectacular.  It's true-- I love it.  Wilson picked some top notch musicians for his solo band.  Again, this is NOT Porcupine Tree.  Instead, it's another prolific avenue for Wilson to explore his creativity.  The price is also amazing--If you like King Crimson, Texture, NIN, sporadic Jazz and progressive elements, this recording is for you.  Happy Shopping... Evan J.
B00AB0NTTI|5.0|Almost anything with Peter Falk is bound to be a classic.  No exception here.  The supporting cast is up to their roles too.
0439023513|3.0|The final installment of The Hunger Games is certainly not as good as the first two, and the ending is a bit unsatisfying, but it's still necessary and a good read.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is so good, glad I put it into my collection. A great story about our environment. Love Dr Seuss and he was a man before his time. Great message. The kid in all of us needed to see this movie. Never read the book.
0374533571|5.0|I think the movie is one of the best films of 2012, and even though the book isn't as good, I loved it. Matthew Quick is an author to look out for, and this is one of the most unique books I've ever read.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Usually a big fan of Nicholas Sparks books, I found this one to similar to the movie sleeping with the enemy. A little disappointing.
0439023491|4.0|This sequel to the magnificent Hunger Games is equally entertaining, and even more intense and thrilling than its predecessor. A magnificent book.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Great movie! Based on a true story, which I love to watch! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
0439023521|4.0|Suzanne Collin's first installment in this trilogy is mesmerizing and is a nonstop ride of thrills and kills, no pun intended.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I wish fox would bring it back. I was very dissapointed when fox cancelled after 2 seasons. The first season is very on the edge of your seat !
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read everything Mr. Grisham has written.  Having lived in some of the same areas where he has resided, I really understand his novels.  At times he says something exactly the way I feel or would have said if I had been writing the novel.  I am so glad he didn't give up after writing his first manuscript!  He is always an easy read and writes the kind of books you just don't want to put down.  This is another example.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I found the beginning of this book pretty basic and i definetley i didnt have to think too much about what the next five chapters were going to be about. Two teenagers who resemble Romeo and Juliet, only on a much larger scale. Is that what typical teenagers act like? I found the whole relationship between them to be way over the top! mushy and exaggerated.....  &#34;Sky&#34; the heroine in the story has had a terrible past, without letting too much away, she suffered terribly when she was a child. The worst that can happen to a child. Luckily though &#34;sky&#34; forgot that it happened. What? i say, how can you possibly forget something like that? Anyway, this is where the book starts to become interesting. &#34;holder&#34; the hero of the story, begins a &#34;who done it&#34; and helps Sky to deal with her past.There are a few interesting twists and turns and I enjoyed this part......  Then.... without giving too much of the story away, the villan, who is an impotant person in the community, gets shot!  The shooter  (one of the stars in the story) casually ends this person's life. I thought, &#34; Oh no, our hero might face the death penalty, its American law, but no, wasn't even questioned about it, in one sentence, the whole episode is swept under the carpet.... I then  lost interest in the book, as I found the ending to be totally ridiculous. Holder and Sky went back to normal the next day and dindn't seem to be too fazed about  the horrible events that just took place in their lives. Its seems their love got them through it all........ If only!
0062197266|5.0|to me, this was a nail biting mystery -  a women with strong OCD tendencies is going about her business and slowly it unfolds just why she has turned into such a nut case - not that people with OCD are nut cases - my sister has OCD - and it's hard - very hard to deal with on her end - I have a little bit of it - but to get on with the story - she meets this nice guy stuart and he helps to get her better and it unfolds that this guy she was with previously was remarkably abusive - oh boy did one part have me gagging -<br />the suspense was slow to start and in the beginning I was getting a little aggravated with the descriptions of her exact OCD movements but man, by page 100 until the end I Was white knuckled gripped to the book - staying up til all hours of the night to finish this one - very very good I STRONGLY recommend it - its not like a who dun it - more like a - dear Lord I'm glad I am reading this and not living it!!!<br />SO get to it! You wont be disappointed!!! I heard that her next one (this is her debut) isn't as good but I don't care I will be first in line to buy and with the amount of books I read - that's saying ALOT<br />A+
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Amazing story and how it was kept all these years by all party involved.  Pros, loyalty by those involved compared to the present time.  What a comparison of loyalty and integrity of U.S. Citizens between Argo and Zero dark thrity.  How the time period of mission to the time print of book and movie.  Praise the Argo mission and the loyalty of the people involved for the security of the US.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Absolutely love this book and series. Don't know what I will do now that it's over and I have to wait for the next one!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave them rating I did because it was excellent  with romance ,action , and mystery. I would recommend this book to kids and adults 10-88.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I found this book very interesting, sad and very awesome! I recommend it for children that are 12 or 13 and over. I loved the book, because it was very detailed, and it kept you reading. I couldn't stop!
1599290642|5.0|I chose it because my son is a featured artist.! Also sent one to my son for his collection. Awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Um this game is just like temple run but once you start playing subway surfers you probably would not play temple run as much because subway surfers is very addicting and you would love it but it can be hard but it is very fun
B00ARX2W24|5.0|Herb Alpert's great 1982 album FANDANGO has finally been re-released, and the word I'm reading that everyone seems to be using is \\"excellent\\", and I have to concur. This is first class all the way, as one would expect from the always reliable Mr. Alpert. As one of the fortunate ones who's had FANDANGO on CD since its 1988 debut in that format, I can clearly hear a big difference in the mastering. The older CD, while good for its time, doesn't have the kick that the new one does. It's not just loudness or a bass boost either. There's some extra \\"magic\\" in these old tracks, and masterer Bernie Grundman and nephew Randy Badazz have worked their own brand of magic to find it and present it to us.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The digipak from Shout Factory fits in well with the earlier releases in the series, but this time is made with a shinier cardboard, mimicking the shinier material that A&M released the vinyl album in back in 1982. It adds an extra sheen to the Richard Avedon black & white photo that graces the cover along with the flaming red Fandango logo. The included booklet is less glossy, but in line with the others in the Herb Alpert Signature Series that were released in the past decade. And the liner notes fit in with their earlier cousins, too. First you get a page with new notes from Herb, then a page reprinting the original liner notes, and then an essay by Gene Sculatti, all followed up with album credits new and old. The back page, as usual, is a reprint from a vinyl album. An interesting variation here is that it's reprinted from a Canadian copy of the FANDANGO LP. You can just make out the tiny French printing at the bottom. The disc face is red colored with the pale colored Fandango logo angled up, with the Herb Alpert Signature Series logo at the top in an ochre color.

B003TSEL7S|4.0|Not as good as the original Percy Jackson books, but still good.  Worth continuing the series if you liked the originals.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It is entertaining to the last page<br />the story is hilarious<br />The characters are described nicely<br />it has interesting connections to history events
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It's epic. The only thing that would make it better would be sharks and other sea creatures. I'll get the whole game!
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I love dystopian novels at least ones that challenge society and how easy it could be to change ones thought process. The only downside to Oliver's book is too much detail and assuming she read Garcia a lot I'm not surprised since he was also very heavy in detail to the point where your waiting for a plot but realize they've been explaining the ocean for the past ten minutes. Anyway I'll read the other ones as I am curious enough to see how Oliver keeps the plot going on what seems like should have been the end
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Unfortunately, Amazon lumped together all the reviews of the digital versions of this movie, so that the release from 2003, which is 153 minutes long and was painstakingly restored with the most amazing digital clean-up ever seen, is lumped together with reviews of \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" which was released in 2010 and is only 147 minutes long by comparison. Now, both of these films have their strong points to highly recommend them, and both have a down side - only by comparison. To make matters worse, the Amazon reviewer whose same review appears for each of these versions, does not offer a review that \\"makes any sense\\". His comments are utterly shallow, if he thinks that all of what is going on in this movie can be reduced to a \\"fortune cookie\\", as if the slogan the film uses is all the film is about.<br /><br />Film buffs who appreciate this movie, and understand the depths of this movie will certainly appreciate both versions. The 2003 version is a much better over-all resoration - it's like watching the film when it was new and pristine, and goes very far to present the formerly missing material (and some material still missing) in a logical way that does not detract from the movie, which is a feast for the eyes. The more modern, \\"Complete\\" version from 2010, is actually 6 minutes shorter. It does have some of the remnants thought \\"long lost\\" included, however, it does not appear that they even lifted one finger to bother trying to restore it to its former visual glory. Shame on them! They finally had the long-lost footage in their hands - something that has been searched for for so many decades, and they didn't bother cleaning it up in the least!<br /><br />Both versions include the fabulous musical store. So, If you want the most striking and pristine visual version. which is actually near complete, than veiw the 2003 version. If you want the version that includes every snippet of long-lost footage, and is actually a decent restoration over-all, view the 2010 version.<br /><br />There is another reviewer who claims that a quarter of the movie has been lost forever. Apparently, that reviewer didn't bother to watch these versions, or perhaps, due to Amazon lumping these all together, it's hard to tell which review fits which version. Both these versions went a long way to recover what was \\"lost\\" and the most recent version succeeded almost 100% - finally!<br /><br />This is one of the most striking films ever made, prophetici sci-fi, amazing photography and special effects, and a story that has plenty of depth - something that escapes the Amazon reviewer entirely.

B00338QENI|5.0|This book lives up to all the praise.  A truly fascinating story on all levels: the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family; the story of the scientific advancements; the story of how the two finally came together. A great and important story told in a great way.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I was somewhat reluctantly persuaded to play this game after a friend mentioned she was playing it and I have to say that this app is both better and worse than I was expecting.<br /><br />The good part of this game is that they have the original VAs for the characters reading off some of the lines, or at least VAs that sound very similar. In this aspect I was pleased, as I wasn't expecting the occasional voice or for the voices to sound accurate. The game play here is very simple, so if you have a young child that is somewhat lacking in eye-hand coordination, they'll be able to pick up on the game play relatively easily. The colors are nice and bright, making the game pleasant to look at.<br /><br />Not so great is that this is a money sink type of game. Many characters require collecting a lot of gems to aquire, meaning that you'll either have to spend in-game cash or take weeks to months to collect enough gems to purchase them. The extra bad news is that some of these characters are required to further the game's storyline. You can still play the game, which is reminiscent of Sim City in many aspects and looks to be identical to Gameloft's Tiny Castle. This isn't something I'd throw away the game on, as I know that Gameloft does have to make money on this, but some of the other characters are almost insanely expensive. If you wanted to purchase Princess Celestia it'd cost about 500-950 gems, which would run you about $50-$100 depending on when you buy it. Other characters are almost as expensive as PC is and when you calculate the amount of gems that you'd have to get to complete certain unskippable quests, the price becomes rather exorbitant, easily getting up into the hundreds of dollars. You could wait, but getting gems is rather slow going, meaning that it could take an extremely long amount of time. I don't mind paying for in-game items now and then, but the price here is pretty steep when you really get down to it. This isn't even including the quests that have you buying non-character items such as decorative pieces and shops for the ponies to work in. This alone will deter some players.<br /><br />Aside from the almost necessity in purchasing items, the other issue is that game play is very repetitive. There are only three minigames, not including the Flim Flam Brothers' bubble pop, which are fun but get a little old when you've done them about twenty or thirty times in order to level up your characters to allow them to earn more bits at the shops. This brings up an issue with long term playability, as this is exactly the type of game that people will get tired with relatively quickly. This might be why Gameloft is charging so much, as they want to get the maximum amount of money as possible before players get bored and leave for greener pastures.<br /><br />Another flaw is that this game frequently crashes or has server issues. It took a while for the server to load up my friend list, with the longest time taking over an hour. I've restarted the game and my iPod, but it takes a really long time. (My iPod is a fairly recent version with many GB of space on it.) It also doesn't help that I can't visit other people's towns because they're playing a \\"different version of the game\\". Considering that Gameloft wants us to spend money on the game, the features here are fairly weak and it crashes a little too often. Gameloft does give relatively decent support for the most part, but that doesn't change that many players are still experiencing issues with playability.<br /><br />This is a decent game, but I admit that if it wasn't MLP:FIM related I probably would have lost interest in the first few days of playing. Part of me wants to give a positive review based on my love for the show, but this is pretty much a mediocre facebook game trying to pretend it's something stronger. Eventually we will get a wonderful game that allows for player interaction, but this just isn't it. I recommend it as a time waster, but I'd wait a while before buying anything to ensure that your money will be well spent. Personally I'd play the game without buying anything and use the money to collect some of the other merchandise out there for the show. This is fun, but it's not really something I see playing long-term. I can't help but think that it would've been better for Gameloft to turn this into a Facebook game and take advantage of the millions of users on that social site rather than run an easily crashable app.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I've had this for about a week now and I'm getting a little frustrated with this. The more I play it, the more and more apparent it becomes that this was slapped together at the last moment. The game is filled with various bugs and crashes at the drop of a hat. With every update that might fix one thing, several other issues pop up. I highly recommend not spending any money on this because I'm genuinely afraid that this will end up crashing to the point where you'll lose massive amounts of data like I've seen with other users. A lot of people are getting told that the way to fix many problems is to play disconnected from the wifi. Only problem is that this makes it harder to do a lot of things with the game that you can only accomplish with other users.<br /><br />This could have been a fun game and there is still some level of fun to it, but this is ultimately one of the most slapdash efforts I've seen at a game tie-in. I won't say it's worse than the ET video game, but I think that if the game didn't have \\"My Little Pony\\" written on it, it would have been abandoned long before now. I really can't help but feel that part of this is due to the limitations of running off of a handheld phone or non-gaming device.<br /><br />Bronies and pegasisters, there will be a proper MLP:FIM game. This just isn't it. Play it for a while, but I definitely recommend not spending money on this. The more I see, the more I'm convinced that this is a sloppily put together game and that the prices are so high because the game manufacturers aren't expecting many, if any, of the original players to stick around long enough for a lower priced in-game purchasing system to give them any profit. They know they put out a mediocre product and they knew that the game would have many, many issues. Rather than wait and give us a polished product, they put out a glitched and for some, almost unplayable game in order to maximize profits.hile before buying anything to ensure that your money will be well spent.

B00BB8SKPW|1.0|While this movies raises several ethical questions it also 'glorifies' drug use. While in the end the character comes clean and recognizes his weaknesses and problems and takes responsibility for his shortcomings, the message of using drugs to counteract the effects of booze was never shown to be an issue,,,in fact it was almost made to be &#34;cool and acceptable&#34;.<br /><br />Washington did a great job with the character, but the movie included drug use and nudity that was not needed to raise the same issues that the story intended to raise.

B007FRHZ4A|4.0|This game has the same concept as [[ASIN:B004U52VPS Angry Birds: Knock On Wood Game]]. It's clever how the makers of this game have turned a digital app into a hands-on family activity. The game is made for two to four players. The box says age 5 and up. I think five- year-olds would enjoy the game, with some modification of the rules.<br /><br />The object of the game is knock over all the pigs from a block structure built by your opponent. Pigs are knocked over using a slingshot launcher to fire the birds into the structure. The birds can't go very far, so this may sound scary, but seems safe. The birds themselves are made of semi-soft rubber, like a collectible rubber duckie.  There are four levels of space missions:  Easy, Medium, Difficult, and Freestyle. The structures become more complex as you move from Easy to Difficult and more points are awarded for the difficult structures. You can get bonus points for breaking open the plastic \\"asteroid\\" or the space helmet of one of the pigs.<br /><br />The idea sounds fun, but I was playing with an older child and we found it very hard to build the more difficult structures. It was sometimes hare to tell from the picture which way to stack some of the blocks - either flat or upright. Many of the blocks don't stack very well, so it became frustrating because the structure would fall while building and you would have to start all over again. Only one person is supposed to build the structure, but we helped each other. An adult or older child would definitely need to help younger children complete the structures. It is also hard to balance the asteroid onto the blocks without it falling over or without knocking down the structure in the process. After a while, we built only the easiest level 1 structures or selected a freestyle card which shows the parts to use but doesn't give a specific structure that has to be copied.<br /><br />When it comes time to launch the birds, the blue bird is hard to launch and doesn't go very far. We adjusted the rules to allow two tries with the blue bird and even this wasn't always enough.  The rules say no points are awarded for partial completion of the mission knocking down all the pigs), but to keep younger kids interested, you may want to modify this or allow more than the two or three shots specified on the cards.<br /><br />Kids who enjoy the Angry Birds app or enjoy building blocks would like this game, but with adult help or changes to the rules. I can see younger kids having fun just playing with the blocks and the figurines without actually playing game.

B00015TOCY|2.0|Much to my dismay, as much as I try to understand this album, I cannot. The vocals are just too grating, the music too cheesy, the lyrics too ...awkward... Yes, it may be my lack of musical \\"cultivation\\" that prevents me from appreciating this album, but I cannot force myself to reach whatever level of \\"cultivation\\" is required to properly enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm no stranger to bizarre or atonal music (I love Throbbing Gristle, Suicide, every other Eno album, and practically all Krautrock), but this album does not even seem to be truly experimental, bizarre, or individualistic to me, rather it seems to simply exude ironicism, contempt, mockery, and passive-aggressiveness. Whereas many other experimental and avant-garde albums completely ignore the pop-music-standard, this album seems to make an attempt to expose all of pop music's cliches and shallowness. To this end, it is fairly effective. But that still doesn't mean I want to listen to it. After all, when I listen to music, I want a unique experience, not a satire.<br /><br />That said, I'm sure there are plenty of things that I'm missing about this album, so this is a tentative review.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I'd like to see the movie, though I haven't.  I'm afraid Amazon has jumped the proverbial ship when it comes to integrity.  Five bucks for the standard definition?  Six for HD if you really even get HD after forking out the dough for it.  720 is HD to Amazon via streaming, but even that isn't guaranteed.  Amazon determines your bandwidth and streams what you can handle. Who can justify that?  I don't care how big your big screen is, it's not as big as a big screen at a theater.  When these online streaming options even get close to the cost of seeing it in a theater, they lose my $$$'s every time.  Golly, sometimes capitalism blows.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|terrific. game and great graphics, but the developer should change at least two of the symbol.<br />there is one that looks similar to swastika and that needs to go.  there is cross which is inappropriate for the game.<br />otherwise this is a fun timewaster.

1400079276|3.0|I was given this paperback for Christmas and I was intrigued because I'd never read one of Murakami's works before.<br /><br />I enjoyed the beginning  - an incident during WW2 when a group of children are subject to an attack of some sort. Despite never being told exactly what happened one is led to presume it was either extra terrestrial or mass hysteria.<br />Almost from the beginning the author throws in plenty of quotes Sartre, Mann, Kakfa, Camus, Hesse, Beckett, etc and he tries to emulate these philosophers citing some of the same issues in a rather superficial way.For example Jungian concepts, the subconscious, Freudian, fate, free will, the nature of morality etc.<br />I liked the plot - it is interesting and clever enough to keep the reader involved and yes, at first it was a real page-turner. Murakami is an entertaining writer and in this book his writing is fairly plain and simple (although he does go off on a tangent at times). But I was soon feeling that it was all a bit pretentious and I was beginning to be disappointed.<br /><br />I enjoyed the two narratives, Kafka,  and especially the old man's magical elements - these begin as unrelated stories and then slowly converge. But, unfortunately, the stories became so mixed up and I thought it didn't quite gel. Murakami left me 'dangling' as it were. He includes the Oedipus curse, but was it all a dream or real? There is a brutal killing and we are again left in suspense - we never learn who killed Tamura in the conventional world. Again, Kafka \\"seems\\" to sleep with his sister and a woman who may or may not be a lover or his mother.The reader never finds out as the novel's ending drops these threads without attempting to either demonstrate how Kafka outwitted 'fate' or that his father cursed him as part of some monumental plan.<br /><br />Bemused?...I was.<br /><br />How were the children immobilized during the war? We're never told what it in fact was. The story here just fizzles out. Parts are completely illogical because we do not discover the full facts. Would I try another book by the writer? Hm. Not sure. Probably not.ly illogical because we do not discover the full facts. Would I try another book by the writer? Hm. Not sure. Probably not.

This series keeps you on the edge of your seat, but is FAR from the typical &#34;zombie&#34; movie. You become attached to the characters, and some you can't wait to see die off, but there is always a twist and surprise along the way! Highly recommend this to anyone who likes adventure shows, and for those who like a sense of the macabre. Definitely wouldn't let my kids watch it. Very gory, but appropriately so.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|Great combo.  As I have stated previously I am a great fan of Will and his partner Tommy.  Many hours of relaxation and viewing in these two movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is lots of fun. I would like to be able to breed my horse or keep my horses in the same place so I don't have to keep switching.but I still love the app.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|I saw this when it first came out many moons ago. It has the same affect on me as it did then.
B00846F1YW|5.0|awesome game. a lot of fun hope ther will be more levels available soon. some thing are hard to find which keeps u searching
B002XWTKC2|5.0|These two actors are at their best in this movie. Once again, Eddie Murphy is awesome in these type of roles.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great colors and symbols and fun for the beginner Mahjong player or higher level players.  Will purchase more Mahjong games in he future.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Saw this when I was in highschool and it was awesome! It is just as awesome now as it was then!
B003HARV3Y|5.0|If you enjoy these Rick Riordan series, you will just love this movie.  It's action packed and great fun for the whole family.  I can't wait for The Sea of Monsters to come out August of this year.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved, loved, loved Downton Abbey! As a longtime Anglophile, I was anxious to watch this, especially after reading so many great  recommendations about it. I did, however, check around everywhere I could think of to find the best available copies. I had seen too many reviews about deleted scenes, the missing Christmas episode, and copies that still contained original commercials!(Incidentally, I've never understood why sellers or whoever would ever delete anything on dvds to be sold, except for commercials, of course. Naturally, I understand why tv would do this when it comes to fitting a movie/documentary, etc. into  a 2 hour time frame, for example.) It was a happy day for me when I saw this version on Amazon.Thank goodness! It was just what I wanted: closed captioning, no deleted scenes, no commercials, and the infamous Christmas episode was included! Furthermore, many extra \\"behind the scenes\\" parts were also included. If  you're interested in the best version available, this one is a & \\"must have\\"! I, like so many others, couldn't stop watching! Very compelling with amazing characters (Don't even get me started on Maggie Smith), unmatched & beautiful scenery & sets, and a story with plenty of fascinating plot developments. Never a dull moment. Looking SO forward to the third season!!! Give yourself a treat and enjoy a wonderful adaptation of a great story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the story lines, filming style and, of course, the fashions.  I found the ending a bit shocking but I am willing to continue to follow and see what becomes of these very interesting characters!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game please give more acorns. more acorns please. also give more sales on the expansions. fun game n how do you give gifts in the kindle edition?
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Wow.  I happen to like J.J. Abrams direction of this movie (although he seems to have his critics).  Very well done in my opinion and an excellent addition to the family!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Ordered this for my Nexus 10 Tablet, got it within a few days.<br />I'm happy with it, although I wish the attached cable was longer.<br />But works fast - good quality.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very interesting tale.  Well written, well acted, and well presented to the public.  I'll be honest: I missed most of seasons one and two and purchased them both from Amazon to catch up in my viewing while season three was already airing.  Thoroughly enjoy the story lines coming from &#34;downstairs,&#34; as well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing. I can say that I have never, ever, cried over any movie, book, tv show, etc., but I cried over this one! So emotional and just plain amazing.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Fantastic show. Hooked me quicker than walking dead has. Survival of humans seems more plausible in this post apocalyptic show, granted you gloss over the fact that the aliens didn't eliminate all humans in their initial attack.
B00004YRQA|5.0|A genuine PS2 memory card, its required by the PS2 to save game data, it functions as it should. I am happy with my purchase.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Excellent - setting and acting and story line. Very personal and actors were very realistic to the period than the setting was placed.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I first head Lindsey play on youtube and found the music was beautiful, I am glad that she has finally released an album. I strongly recommend this album to any music lover out there!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Argo was a great movie from start to finish! It's worth seeing for sure, you won't be disappointed. A must see!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great mix of intense, spooky, full of deep characters and twisting plot. The author slowly spins out the reasons for life in the Silo through the eyes of a few different characters but mainly a very strong woman who digs to find the truth in a tower of lies.  Well done.  There are a few places where the story lags but they aren't long and are quickly picked back up with the intrigue and strongly written characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you're looking for a story with good, strong female characters and a look into a distopian future and it's survivors, this is definitely worth picking up.
1401941893|4.0|I wanted to read this book because I was curious on Miranda's input for overcoming insecurities. Being a Victoria's Secret model Miranda would definitely be a prime candidate on the necessity to have learned how to carry herself with confidence. She has had success in an industry that surely has the ability to be brutal on One's opinion of themself.<br /><br />What I found, was her message was an incredibly simple approach to love yourself and anticipate the best out of life. She writes with a gentleness that is not long winded to lose the attention of the reader who is seeking a less intense version of \\"self help\\".  You are easily able to open a page and walk away with some positive input for your day without making a big production of it.<br /><br />The book is definitely geared towards a more feminine audience in its attractive pink colors and flowers donning it. However, the core message is one anyone can gain something from as she believes our thoughts are the key to success. I would like to add that if I had a young daughter or woman in my life who was struggling to recognize her own worth I think, Treasure Yourself, would be a good book to purchase her. Considering Miranda's career I believe it would help young girls and women take more notice of her message which I think was Miranda's hope herself.<br /><br />Miranda shares her experiences of uncertainty towards modeling and if it was the path she really was meant to take. So for anyone who thinks that even models never experience insecurity you can think again! She also explains why she is an advocate, like most people successful in their field of work, of using positive affirmations to help her stay focused on the good life has to offer. Her hopes are that women would learn to embrace their own beauty regardless of the different facets each one has. She affectionately refers to the beauty of flowers and how their differences are similar to the beauty of women. Each one offering its own loveliness.<br /><br/>I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for review purposes.<br /><br />I was not financially compensated for this post.

B001GMH8RO|5.0|This film is a powerful love story.  It is the ultimate chick flick. Patrick Swayze' best, in my opinion.If you haven't seen it, do so.  You will enjow every minute.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really liked the book. If you liked the 50 Shade  Trilogy, then this book is a good one to read after. Gideon still isn't Christian but hey! It will work. I read it in one day. Can't wait to start the next one!
0393061434|5.0|Nice to hear a personal diialog on the start of Apple  Why do hackers always think that any mischief they admit was always done for their selfless altruistic motives?
B004N6369Y|3.0|Very good but a little slow for her style but I still loved it always satisfied but they are predictable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it! It left me tears eyed but, also left me wanting more. . .true love always lat through all the trials.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is awesome many different levels which get more challenging as it goes I recommend this game to people of all ages. It plays a lot like the original diner dash but way better graphics and alot of different choices
1400063736|5.0|What can I say? It's a good read and came to me in excellent condition.<br />Very happy.  I purchased for my book club collection and couldn't be happier.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I am 55 and I love this game.I think my grankids would love this to. The way you have to keep the fish away from the pollution,the farther you get into it you don't want to stop.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Where are the Canadians? Seems they deserve more credit in the movie. There must have been some Iranian help also!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel; surprise ending! Characters were well defined. Suspense and romance a good combination; made the ending that more unpredictable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Interesting how life's experiences prepares you for the \\"real\\" world.<br />Loved listening to her thoughts.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Although, I would've liked a bet more depth in a couple areas, I really loved reading this books .  The endless 80's references that spark a trip down memory lane are worth the time it takes to read this book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Stephanie outdid herself with the grand finale! It was a great finish with the possibility of continuing another book. A lot of characters with a lot more possibilities. Action packed!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|My father rarely asks me to order anything for him, but he asked for this and I preordered it. It came very fast, and well, the music is wondnerful!
B005BDZN62|5.0|A movie is a great movie if I want to see it  year  after year. If the movie stands the test of time after 50 years, then its a classic! Although I never saw the original Broadway version, I think the actors in this movie are superb. I know they have revivals of West Side Story and other classics on Broadway. WHY, DONT DO IT!! Just watch this movie. There wont be anyone who can do it better, especially the dancing. Those men and women are untouchable! Cannot go wrong with this purchase
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Since I got my iPad about 9 months ago, I have read more books than I have in years. Steve Jobs was one of the many. I thought it was well written and gave me insight on Steve, Read it, you will like it!
B006JTS5OO|4.0|i grew up with the Henson Muppets so I am very biased when it comes to dealing with that legacy. Jason did a good job. It was cute, entertaining and nice to see the old characters back in true form. I know that some of the story has to bring in the younger generation but I was glad to see something for those of us who remember the good old days of the Muppets and their show. Statler & Waldorf, can never go wrong with them!!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I love Bruno's voice and his music and lyrics are classic and refreshing. Not many of today's music artists can actually sing and Bruno is one of them. I'm going to go back and get his first CD because of how nice this one is. I think I'm a fan for life!
B005KELW26|5.0|I was getting tired of my black case, so when I saw this on line I grabbed it.  Well made.  Really like it.
B000WQW988|5.0|Awesome, stunning, sad, exciting, depressing, shocking, enlightening, timeless and much more. A must-own for Nirvana fans. The entire (unedited) included here is incredible.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I purchased this product and noticed that the connector that connects to the minidisplay port was starting to become loose after the first month.  I milked it a couple months more until the connector actually come apart exposing the pins.<br /><br />I contacted Moshi, and they were unwilling to replace.  Poor customer service, and poor product quality.<br /><br />Steer clear!
0446569895|5.0|Okay, first off it's hard to believe Ozzy is still alive after reading this book.  It's a no holds bio of his life and his absolutely crazy lifestyle.  It's good to read he's cleaned himself up so he'll be around for a while to come!  The book easily deserves a 5 star rating because of his honesty in it.  He just doesn't care what he admits to, but how he lasted this long will remain a mystery to me.  I can highly recommend this book.  It's funny as hell.  You just can't make stuff like this up!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Many things to keep me busy and Solitare helps me take my mind off things. Great way to relax....Thank you.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book I could not put it down and was disappointed when it ws over. Makes me want to live like that bit also scares me that society is heading that way!  Definate must read.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|These are great toys!<br />They are my son's favorite of all legos.<br />i just absolutely loves them.<br />This is a good price.<br />Thanks!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|How can you go wrong renting a movie with Denzel Washington in it?  Despite some moments where it seemed a bit slow, overall a good movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't read many books lately due to my work schedule but this book really grabbed my attention and got me to give up watching any television until I finished it. A coworker recommend it and when I saw the low price and tons of 5 star reviews I thought I would give it a shot. Man I am glad I did. This is a great scifi-ish, post-apocalyptic story. Not a bunch of scifi but enough to grab my interest. Some parts were so intense I couldn't put it down. My wife is reading it now and I got a friend of mine to purchase it as well. I saw there is a movie in production, I hope they do the book justice. Great job Hugh!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A wonderful movie about hope and love overcoming physical impairments and emotional scars.  Clint Eastwood was excellent, and the supporting cast didn't disappoint.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It's fun to play a game like mahjong, but in 3D.  The designs are fun, the colors are neat, and I like 3D part makes it unique.
B008OOYALE|1.0|The game is nonsense and I do not enjoy it.  I was playing Restaurant Story and the purchase of this game was one of the goals I had to accomplish.  The game was free but that's not the point.  I CHOSE to play Restaurant Story and then this was a tag-along game.  I do not care for that'
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great acting, great story, well done. Edge-of-your-seat type movie that is deserving of the hype. Side note: I am not a fan of history, it is a forced knowledge for me, but this movie I loved.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Very deep and emotional movie. I also definitely recommend the book. I personally love Logan Lerman, he's such a great actor!
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has an incredible and touching story with a great ending. Plenty of good action including a major battle in the beginning. It might be from 2000 but the special effects dont look dated at all. The soundtrack is one of the best ive heard. Bought it on Itunes so i could listen whenever I wanted. Honestly, there's nothing this movie lacks. The costumes, setpieces, everything is there. I don't know about the blu-ray quality because I got the amazon download version. Get it, you wont regret it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is by far better than Temple Run. The graphics are great and youget to choose your own characters. WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!
B00634GHJA|5.0|It took all of 5 minutes to set it up and get the hang of how it works. Speed of transfer wasa bit dazzling - never expected it to work so well.
0307361012|4.0|I enjoyed this first Harry Hole thriller; it had me turning the pages and trying to solve the mystery. I will definitely read the next one in the Hole series!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is a page turner. This is the second book I've read by this author and can't wait to get my hands on another!
B001AOKA3W|1.0|This film is rediculously amaturish.  I know it is supposed to look that way, but realy once the party is over, apparently there are only five people in all of Manhatten.  Most of the dialogue is screaming, OMG!  The Army had an almost immediate response to the event.  They seem to have arrived en mass about five minutes after the scary spidery thing appears.  Shades of 9/11 with buildings crashing down.  It seems you can have an injury serious enough to bleed to death, but once extracated you can run several city blocks.  This wasn't bad film-making it was the worst movie I may ever have seen in my 61 years!  Too much unbelievable feats, too much reliance on main characters (apparently after these five can not escape the city, they are all alone--we know now how fast and efficiently you can evacuate NYC); why bother paying for extras to make it more realistic?  Bad, bad, theatrics.  Bad acting.  Poor dialogue.  Thematically as old as Godzilla.  Don't waste time or money on this film
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this VERY much. To anyone in need of an action packed  , thrill filled adventure, this is a must read.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|really like this series  so different from anything i have read before  love the characters book 1,2 very good  book 3 lacks the humor and character  but book 4 brings you back
B004PGO25O|4.0|It's right. It very simply describes, at least metaphorically, what keeps us from accomplishing the work is resistance. It's a good, short, pep talk.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|really odd story  dont like having to buy &#34;books&#34; that are really just chapters to get to the end of a story
B0090O07RS|3.0|If you're a fan of the doors, this is obviously essential.<br /><br />But if you are a general concert film buff who appreciates high quality Blu-Ray releases, this particular Blu-Ray is very problematic. I can only presume the problem comes from the source material, which I assume was shot in 16mm. 16mm productions provide challenges for blu-ray producers because the film grain becomes so dramatically evident. So some producers have taken to using a process that blurs the grain while retaining the edge clarity of elements in the video. Done very subtly, this can improved the appearance of a film without becoming obvious or distracting.<br /><br />Done poorly--as with Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl--it becomes a case a what is known as grain rape; a crime against the original aesthetic of the footage.<br /><br />Particularly in long shots the band look like a moving oil painting. I haven't seen the DVD version but it simply HAS to be better than this thing.<br /><br />The gold standards for concert footage clarity is clearly Queen Rock Montreal, and other productions like AC/DC live in Donington. But not all bands could afford 35mm I guess. So to me there's no need to destroy the image in an effort to \\"make it better\\" just because it was shot in 16mm.<br /><br />But beyond that, it sounds pretty terrific; which a mix emphasizing a \\"concert sound\\" and echo, and very unadventurous camera work (which is actually a really really good thing). Mostly just straight on shots of the full band with occasional close ups.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This novel is a realistic look Aspergers syndrome from the point of view of a teenager with the behavioral disorder. It is easy to identify with the characters even in their most unlikable moments. There is no happy ending, but I found myself celebrating Christopher's accomplishments and sympathizing with his family even when they were at their worst.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This new Total Recall is more Blade Runner than anything else... an oppressive totalitarian multinational society concentrated in uber-metropoleses... \\"filmed\\" entirely in rainy nightscapes or indoors/underground until the final scene... stuff like that, I don't want to give it away too much. Just a nod to the original TR, and a couple of imaginative twists. There's tons of death via multiple bullets, yet no blood. Monchromatic computer cityscape and action. Lots of chase (running from baddies) scenes, not really that much hand-to-hand. The original Arnie film won't win any acting awards, but is INFINTELY more entertaining.<br /><br />Farrell was adequate, nothing more. Unconvincing action and acting. Seemed lost and confused the whole time.<br /><br />Jessica Biel was friggin' horrible. With the 80s teenage offset ponytail and constantly being saved from certain peril... sheesh. Dudley Dooright stuff.<br /><br />I thought Kate Beckinsale stole the show. I've only seen her before in Van Helsing and the Underworld franchise and though yeah, whatever, Kate who? In Total Recall she delivered more intensity, believabilty, acting, kick-ass attitude, and... well, raw sex appeal. I had to look at the credits again because I was like \\"wow, who is this actress?\\"<br /><br />Okay, I can't help it... a robot stormtrooper army? Really?
0802473156|5.0|This book is amazing and has helped my husband and I a lot. I recommend this to anyone who feels like love is lost
B00AV68GOA|5.0|If you're a fan of Downton Abbey then you'll enjoy this book. These are the episodes as written  by Downton Abbey writer/creator Julian Fellowes. In the extensive footnotes Fellowes explains why certain creative decisions were made.
1451696191|5.0|I am almost positive that everybody who has encountered a turning point in their life or lived in suburban America has thought the way this book was written.  There is something in this book for everyone to hold close to their heart.  Everybody believes their story is unique which is true but when it's boiled down, everybody feels the same way.  I wouldn't suggest this book if you're looking for a pick me up although I found some parts witty and produced some chuckles.  But in a period of your life when you feel like you need somebody to talk to and nobody could understand how you feel because it's difficult to describe....this book clears issue right up...as for your other issues that's why there are self help books.
B002SAS26E|5.0|I have now played this with my 9-year-old daughter a few times and she and I have had a lot of fun playing it. This is a pretty light game that relies quite a bit on luck. But there are enough strategic choices to be made on each turn to make it feel like you always have a fighting chance. The game comes in a nice, compact box with a nifty molded plastic insert to hold all the cards and tokens.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|I read its Korean version and I bought English version.<br />The title was different(The outsider) but no problem with it.
0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay is a tale of three books.  Part I dealt with the silly plot line of turning Katniss into a propaganda tool.  It was good to get a little flavor for what life in district 13 is like, but the book probably would have been better off without this tedious section.  Part II was a little better as they begin their training to take out the capital, learn what's been done to Peeta during his captivity, etc.  It brings back memories of the first Hunger Games.  Part III was the best part of the book as it returns to the action/drama formula that made the first book such a page turner.  Unfortunately, just as it was getting good...it's like Collins decided to quit writing.  The ending (even with the subtle twist at the end) was very anti-climactic.  Mockingjay is worth reading in order to finish the trilogy, but it was a lackluster effort that lacked the action/drama of the first book and the character development of the second book.  Disappointing to say the least...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game - favorite of the year. Very well done and although they do sell coins in the game for those that want to spend money and trick out their character, it's also possible to earn enough coins to buy a variety of characters/boards/etc. Great way to pass the time
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Very classy!!  Fits well and protects even better. I love the leather like feel of the case over the nylon ones that are on the market.
1878424319|5.0|I love this book and recommend everyone in need of relieving any heartache or confusion about why others are not as nice as they believe they are!!! I am very happy and thankful with my purchase!! awesome service!! Thank you!
B00B2QA646|5.0|The movie was absolutely stunning, beautiful, cinematic, and orginal. The actors complimented one another and made the emotions so real. I loved the idea of a movie/theater intertwining, so cool! I plan on watching this movie over and over again. Bonus, Aaron Taylor-Jackson, so deliciously naughty.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Great read! Kinsella has done it again with her affable characters that suck you in, rooting for the happy ending you want!
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|The acting was good, but the pace of this story was rushed for such a long story.  This story should be a miniseries, not a movie.  Only then would it do justice to the characters and story.  The &#34;staged version&#34; of the story didn't work for me.  Although the dancing scenes were beautiful, the rest of the movie needed the opulence and grandeur of the 19th century Russia.  The racing scene, for instance, lost something by being staged inside rather than outside.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Seems like it could be fun, but when I try to load the game it constantly restarts. I might try the game later currently Un installed.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Casting and direction bring fresh life to the Sherlock genre. I can't wait for the next seasons. Hope there will be mor.
B00631HASU|5.0|Loaded to my Kindle Fire with NO problems and operates perfectly.  Really enjoy this game.  Can pass hours with this game and not even realize it's been that long!! Has enough levels that it isn't one of those games that you can easily beat and have nothing left to do!!! Definitely worth getting.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|great movie, great story<br /><br />brought me back in time and looked for him in the present!<br />Great music and very nostalgic
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Downloaded and plays perfectly on the Kindle Fire.<br />Most definitely worth paying for...although i don't generally PAY for games with all the free ones out there!!!<br />Will keep you busy for HOURS without realizing that much time has even passed!!!<br />Try the free one first if you have any doubts but think once you do, you'll go with the Premium!!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I am glad I did not see the movie before I read this book.  I heard the movie was science fiction like and I did not picture that at all when I read it.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Downloaded this the other day and I don't regret it!<br />Free and definitely worth it!<br />Downloaded to my Fire effortlessly and is so easy to use!!<br />Has soooo many possibilities!!!  I use mine as a &#34;diary&#34; and to keep track of my bills, etc!!!<br />Is kinda like an all-in-one app that you don't have to pay for!!!<br />Won't regret this if you are organized like i am!
0132350882|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to every programmer, regardless of experience level. This book will help you express yourself through code in clean and understandable way, and will make you an awesome team player.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|After downloading and playing the &#34;free&#34; version of this game to my Fire,,i was addicted!!!!  So, naturally, i had to get the premium version!!<br />You won't be disappointed!!!<br />I don't generally buy games as there are so many free ones out there...but this one played so well and is so addicting that i just HAD to purchase the premium one!!!<br />Downloaded and played perfectly on the Fire.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Its more angry birds.  I dont know what I could tell you about it that you dont already know or to be helpful. I enjoy even the original, but the newer versions are different and good in their own way.  Something about the classic though.  Great graphics, great game play, fun story.
B000J3OTSM|2.0|The movie is full of clichés and extremely predictable. The dancers are good and fun to watch but as a whole not worthwhile to buy and watch unless you do something else like practice guitar at the same time or hold a loved one...
1592407889|5.0|Lucky Me gives new meaning to \\"poor little rich girl.\\"  Born to a famous mother and mysterious father, Sachi moves from Japan to America to England to Switzerland to Australia and back and forth in a dizzying array of experiences.  Rootless and sometimes lost and penniless, she bounced from lowly waitress in a noodle shop in Japan to a career as an award winning actress.  Sachi can skip a whole bunch of reincarnations.  She's done at least ten in one lifetime.  I couldn't put the book down, but when I did, comparing my uneventful Midwestern upbringing in a lower middle class neighborhood to hers, I thought, \\"Lucky me.\\"  [...]

B00ARAO720|2.0|Expected more from the talent and director/writer of this very thinly plotted and acted movie set on the streets of Manhattan.
0061537969|2.0|Full disclosure: I don't have a dog, have never had a dog, and will never have a dog due to severe allergies. I read this as part of a book club. I think this would have been a cute short story but did not have the depth to be a novel. I realize it's the dog's voice we're hearing, so it's not going to be extremely intellectual in thought, but it was just boring to me. The pages that went on and on about his day, racing, watching TV. The dog's owner didn't interest me either, I don't know why.<br /><br />I think dog lover's would probably enjoy this book a lot more than I did. Just not my cup of tea.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|There was no reason to remake the original after watching this very unimaginative remake.  Better digital effects do not a better movie make.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really could not put this book down.  A complicated, intricate, well developed plot that is riveting up to the last page.
B005K17RU0|5.0|lets you instantly check the weather by the hour, day , week or month and gives heads up weather warnings - use this one a lot
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Must admit, This book surprised me.<br /><br />The title was without doubt the only disappointment. If it wasn't for the 600+ 5 star reviews and the 2 1 star reviews I would never have purchased this book. Mr Ryan, Work on your titles :D.<br /><br />The book, is without doubt, a fantastic read. Ryan does not copy or try and follow in the footsteps of Tolkien, Jordan or Martin like some novels I've read and actually makes quite a fresh story.<br /><br />The book itself is told from one characters PoV (Third Person) with another characters PoV (in first person) in some prologue's to different parts of the book. I feel this is one thing I've found different to most novels I've read as they tend to jump around between 20 odd characters. And despite having the less view points of other characters the book remains quite fresh and interesting. It's a real good page turner and I'd recommend to give it a go if your an avid fan. Can't wait for the second book, so hurry it up!.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|This tale of the death and succession of King Alfred the Great is interesting and bloody. The infighting and real fighting make for engrossing reading. Some of the characters and events are fiction, but the basic facts are correct. You learn a lot about wounds, fighting techniques, and political maneuvering. Verry interesting if you can stomach the gross details.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds rio is fun and challenging.I recommend this game for all angry birds followers, like the graphics, sounds and themes.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|You won't find a book quite like Cloud Atlas. Mitchell bends several genres in this multi-perspective novel, blending story elements together in rather unique ways and creating an interesting effect regarding the concept of time.<br /><br />  Cloud Atlas begins like a classic travel novel set in the past. Each section jumps to a different time and seemingly different world. \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\" takes on a techno-dystopian feel, while another section shifts to a post-apocalyptic vibe.<br /><br />  Numerous threads connect each section, including the song, \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" and even sections of the novel itself, while the characters have strange déjà vu experiences that suggest a metaphysical connection to characters from different times.<br /><br />  Mitchell displays a gift with language by adopting distinct voices for each of his narrators, placing them in their own particular worlds. The dialect shift in \\"Sloosha's Crossin'\\" is somewhat difficult to adjust to, but readers soon get a feel for how the characters speak. My only hang-up with the book was that I wasn't instantly hooked, but once I became immersed, I could hardly put it down. The prose was spectacular at times, and I was anxious to see what Mitchell would do next.<br /><br />  Cloud Atlas is a solid 509 pages, but the novel is genius and well worth the read, especially if you enjoy experimental and cross-genre writing.<br /><br />Fans:<br /><br />If you liked the Sci-Fi elements and plot twists in Cloud Atlas, you might enjoy [[ASIN:B00AWU8KDW Starlight City]]
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A continuation of these series just keeps you and edge for more.  Looking forward to the growning family and the out workings of events.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|Great plot, great author, good fast paced story.  I think this is must read for science fiction fans.  Get it now.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've enjoyed every single minute of this and can't wait to see more of what the future brings about with this family.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|Great movie, this was based on how it was back in those moonshine days. I thought they did a awesome job of acting in this movie and it kept your attention at all times.
081095415X|5.0|A terrific book! Great to have and own. A wonderful experience. When one understands what is happening to the elephants in east Africa, the pictures brings it home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting and awesome, I love it. I would definitely recommend this game to my friends and anyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The story lines are very fluid, there is a delicate balance between gorey violence and intense drama. Additionally, each episode is almost like a full feature. What this season has brought us so far has never been done for TV. Keep up the great job!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book. It was interesting and it pulled me in. Heck, I was up until 10:00 reading! I couldn't put it down. My friend told me about this series and said I would love it. Boy was she right! I'd reccomend this book to any age from ten and up. It's an easy read, but it's so good. You just can't put it down!
B009VLXMJA|5.0|T-Swizzle!  I hope you see this!  I love you!  I woulddate you given the chance!  Shake them haters off girl!
B000001DWG|5.0|This album, which is the predecessor to both Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, is a major factor in developing the &#34;Seattle Sound&#34; and early 90's alternative rock found in bands like Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, etc.  If you want to see where that sound came from, this is one album of several that will give you a taste of that.  The music is very original and has a markedly different sound for the time period.  Great album.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Can't use it because you don't have my browser.  Does not do anything for me and many other people who have tried to get it to work.<br />Sorry, but without Adobe flash player I can't get your videos or some other e-mail videos.
B004IM14RY|5.0|This movie will make you uncomfortable. And it will make you glad you never went to help rebuild any country we ever fought in. I remember back in the early 90s people going over to rebuild and making tons of money to do so. This movie shows one of the reasons those people were paid so well. As for me, i am staying right here in America , thank you.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies especially since it  was the original arm of the CIA.  May be wrong but I know that the OSS was the original if what I heard and read was true.  A great film in any case.
B001KRVLCI|5.0|5 star flick! This has lots of action! Travolta and Cage in the prime of their careers. Drug use, violence, language and sex. If these offend you, look elsewhere.

1419705849|5.0|My 9 year old loved this whole series. Captain Underpants and Diary of a Wimpy Kid are like Milk and Oreos to my kids.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|From the Cinemetography, to the Cast, this production is exquisite - the story line is exceptional right down to the cast wardrobe.  Downton Abbey keeps you coming back for more.  The acting is superb! The interaction amongst the characters is exceptional.  I don't want this to end.  Love it Love it Love it!!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Keeps you interested from beginning to end. Will download 2nd part...I'm hooked. It is very well thought,l and executed. My favorite game so far.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It is always interesting to learn how people in other countries live out their lives.  Here in America we are used to so much more in the way of modern conveniences.  It reminded me in a way of the James Herriot  books where so many people were so dependent on a few head of livestock to eke out a living.  McKenna has captured that somewhat bleak existence very well.  Her characters, of course, knew no other life and were satisfied with what they had.  It was a nice story.  Funny, insightful, and with a surprise ending.
B003B02PF4|4.0|I really enjoyed the European landscape in this book as well as the intricacies of Mr Grisham's narrative. I may have to visit italy!
B0095P33IW|5.0|I really wasn't expecting to like it. But I did. Now I have to watch Iron Man and Thor before I watch the scavengers. I blame my 15 year old for this.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I started reading this LAST night and couldn't wait to finish it today,  loved it! Good story line great characters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Haven't had an issue yet. Works as good if not better then a normal calculator. Hopefully this app is something I can use for more difficult problems down the road.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|Works in Windows 7x64 and Linux - I got this for using with WireShark for network analysis and it works perfectly for that as I needed two ethernet links from my laptop when monitoring with a switch in port mirroring mode.<br /><br />One star knocked off for not being able to find drivers on the web site, but the ones on the CD worked - I just know that drivers are updated frequently (or should be.)
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Good story but the books get better as the series progresses. All on all a great book from a great author.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Came quick. Has very long cord. Mic is very sensitive. Battery lasts a long time. Doesnt work on JVC GZ HD7 3ccd camcorder.
030758836X|3.0|The story was so good (and well written) and had me hooked. but then the ending was literally TERRIBLE! It's like she just got tired of writing the novel and stopped. Unless there is a sequel planned then this was a total disappointment.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Bridgit Mendler is so much fun, her music is full of life and it just makes you want to smile while your singing along!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love these books, very well written! I have read both books so far, and the books are way better then the movie. I was not happy with the movie, just a warning if you like the books
