B007K3JFUQ|4.0|\\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\\" is an excellent and fun sequel to 2009 film, and well worth it. Though, I do not recommend watching it without watching the first one as I've found the first film to be quite a \\"warming up\\" to Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock Holmes. It was \\"entertaining\\" to watch him in this role and I have great respect for him as an actor.<br /><br />This film is a story of Holmes and Watson joining forces once again to outwit their most cunning and dangerous adversary, Professor James Moriarty. There were scenes that are surprisingly interesting and others can be quite dull. But, it's the story itself that implored my curiosity to read Conan Doyle's short story \\"The Final Problem\\", where the film was influenced by.<br /><br />Anyway, it's an enjoyable film.

Andrew Marlowe's vision for the characters and story arcs is laid out by the final ending scene.  Leaves you anticipating of that first episode of season 2.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|A great coming of age story without being all too bad like the other stories that seem to be trying too hard. Really sweet and has a good message to all readers. A universal theme that everyone can relate to in their own way.

We went to the after Christmas sales and purchased another set with her Christmas money. Now she has a whole &#34;family&#34; and lots of adventures ahead of her. I love the imagination Lego brings out in kids...and adults!!

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|It's difficult to understand how such an ill-conceived film got funded. One can only assume the producers figured fans of the frist two \\"Alien\\" films would line up for a prequel that answered the questions those films raised. Had I been the reader, I would have sent back the script with \\"Try again -- a lot harder!\\" scribbled on the cover.<br /><br />I expected a film with profound insights into Life, the Universe, and Everything. What I got was a story that, for the first 90 minutes, rehashed \\"Alien\\". The voyagers do all the stupid things the people in the first film do, with minor variations. When we finally start getting answers to our questions, they turn out not to be particularly surprising or deep. And at least one major issue isn't properly addressed or resolved.<br /><br />The following is from the Wikipedia article: \\"According to Scott, although the film shares 'strands of Alien's DNA, so to speak', and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.\\" Most viewers are likely to strongly disagree -- especially as the first film had no particular mythology, or any \\"idea\\" other than to scare the crap out of the audience (which it did very well).<br /><br />The script is mechanical, sloppy, and thin, especially in the dialog department. Unlike the first two films, which focus tightly on the characters and their predicament, \\"Prometheus\\" has unnecessary scenes and slack, pointless dialog. I was particularly annoyed by the scenes in which Janek asks Vickers if she's interested in hanky-panky, and Vickers stating that Weyland is her father (when their //actions// up to that point make that clear).<br /><br />Ridley Scott's direction is no more than competent. Though the general lack of tension might be partly due to our familiarity with the material, it's hard to believe \\"Prometheus\\" was directed by the man who helmed \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\". The only sequence that doesn't come across as wholly mechanical is Shaw's using a computer-controlled surgery machine to perform a Caesarian. But it's so over the top that it's hard to believe, as is Shaw's ability to be up and around right after.<br /><br />A major disappointment from a director who seems to have been asleep at the wheel.puter-controlled surgery machine to perform a Caesarian.

B005LAII1C|4.0|Just when you thought there weren't any lines left to cross, Seth MacFarlane does via catapult. It's hysterical watching a magically-brought-to-life teddy bear acting like Lindsay Lohan.
B007MDB548|5.0|I like when films have some story that does not goes precisely where one would expect. In this magical history, Tinker Bell will be presented as a found character and so, a new story more based on new stuff and new characters can be introduced softly. My daughter and I loved this film and I think most of children will do too.
B008G59IKO|5.0|Green Day does it again with an amazing album. This particular series, Uno, Dos, Tres, has only further established their already Hall of Fame career as musicians.
B001ECQ4DA|4.0|This series reminds me of the dynamic that my high school friends shared. Great scripting, and overall a funny experience.
0679805273|5.0|I have 4 Grandaughters - bought one for each.  The oldest one's book has begun - the rest will wait until they go to school - The individual grade teachers' comments should mean something when granddaughter graduates from high school and is presented with this book from the Grandparents.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were here to see that????
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We never saw this show on TV but heard so much about it that we have bought the three, yes I said three seasons of this show.<br />We have viewed the first two already and are awaiting the arrival of 3 at the end of the month. It is wonderful and the picture quality on the purchased disks is even better HD than the broadcasts in HD on TV. History social buff get going on this.... I am not an expert but I am really enjoying this. The first season starts with the sinking of the Titanic, the second season is WWI and third is unknown yet. The differences in the classes in England and how they change over time. How the aristocracy lived......on and on.....

B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book! All his books are awesome. Can't read them fast enough then I'm upset that it's over.  Hurry up and write another one.
0385535147|2.0|Long devoted Grisham fan I was anxious to get back after a two year break due to family illness.  All my previous Grisham reads were absolutely \\"can't put it down\\" experiences.  This never was and I kept waiting to get to that.  Half way through, I figured it just wasn't going to happen.  All his books I was intently into the plot.  I tried with this one only to find towards the end he was \\"brain screwing\\" the reader.  I was insulted by the deception.  Good chuckle for him I'm sure.  I am sure the plot would have been equally interesting, or much better, if he was forth coming with the plan.  Maybe after so many books he's burning out of material.  Maybe he should take a rest and regroup for a while.  I really felt let down.
B00005JKZV|1.0|The disk case says it's a two disk set including the feature film and the special effects. Inside there is only the special effects. Very frustrating. Very Displeased. The disk case is also flimsy. The plastic on the back of the case is dented/creased.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was fun to play. I will be looking forward to the second part. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Definately one of the best movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. I was so surprised about the idea itself and how well it was all crafted and played. Watching the movie I thought Di Caprio has finally grown up. You probably have to see it more then once. But it is so worth it.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell. If you are, you may be disappointed by this flick. It is not a typical Ferrell comedy vehicle, but it is a great story, with a fine supporting cast. Queen Latifah, Dustin Hoffman. Emma Thompson is outstanding. Pay close attention to the animated graphics. Very clever.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Not my kind of movie but was good.  I couldn't stop watching because I was afraid I would miss something.

B00563M11M|3.0|The latest Discworld novel focuses on Commander Vimes and the plight of the downtrodden, subhuman goblins. Compared to previous books the humour was more subdued, though there were some laugh out loud moments. It was a lot darker and serious in parts then most of the series.<br /><br />Vimes, while one of my favourite characters (though no match for Carrot), was overdone here. There were some asides to the rest of the Watch but not enough to break up the serious tones.<br /><br />This wasn't the greatest Discworld book but it was great to dive into that realm again and I can't wait for the next one. Long live Discworld!
B004WR125O|4.0|The adapter worked in my system, wireless router is about 40 feet away down a hall. Considering the cost of the unit to the manufacturer I think it should be included with the receiver. Maybe this is less of an issue with new homes being pre-wired for whole house internet.
B000JQUZCI|2.0|Yes I did give it two stars. I really don't get what everyone sees in this and it reminds me once again that \\"classic\\" really just means old book. Also I remember just how much I dislike the writing style of that era. So much waffling. The book could easily do with a good trimming.<br /><br />Frankenstein is one of those characters that really pisses me off. He is a whiny piece of s*** and I could not find any redeeming qualities in him at all. He caused the whole issue through his own pride and arrogance and instead of dealing with it goes catatonic instead. He then proceeds to gambol around and inflict his invention on those he loves all the while crying \\"woe is me\\" like a pathetic teenager.<br /><br />The only interesting part of the book for me was the monsters tale. The book really picked up at that point and I was hoping the rest of the book would be as intriguing. But no after that we're back to Frankenstein's moping.<br /><br />I was glad to see the end of the book and it really proved the point that just because something is popular does not mean it is good.
B0026ICMOG|5.0|The 7 dwarfs are adorable and the movie brings back so many memories!  This is a must have if you love Disney movies :)
B0045HCJRG|5.0|one of my favorite feel good movies...been looking all over for it..gave it to myself for Christmas..always a pick me upper movie
0345525558|5.0|The book came as described, came in the time frame it was supposed to, and I am happy with the service.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a great book about coming of age. Sort of reflective and similar to A Catcher in the Rye. It is an easy read so don't expect to be challenged by way of vocabulary. It is told through the eyes of a teenage boy, so the language can be explicit.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was not overwhelmed by the story, it was very sad tho. I will read the other bc of the ending. I have to finish reading the story. Katniss was brave and daring but was still just a kid, confused about alot, but knew how to survive. Same with Peeta, but his feelings were more honest. Seems he was alot like his dad.
B007JMW46U|4.0|have not finished as yet  but looking foreward to the rest of the book.  easy reading and is what i expecct of sherlock homes<br /><br />stories
0670026603|4.0|I bought this book after reading a favorable review in USA Today. The subject sounded intriguing so I downloaded a sample to my iPad. When I finished reading the sample, I was so caught up in the story that I immediately purchased the book.  I read it in two days and was in tears at the end.  Not the type of book I normally read as I'm primarily a non-fiction reader. So glad I decided to read this one.<br />The main character is extremely likeable and I hope the author writes a sequel. I found reading about the British culture interesting.  My only complaint is the switching of who is telling the story at times. The first time it happened I was confused. If the author was going to use that technique she should have included a chapter with Will's voice.<br />Overall, I have to highly recommend this gem of a book. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|What a great story..  I highly recommend reading this book, I just hope the movie is as good the book.
B00005JLKB|4.0|I like this series and the characters in it so having the season allowed me to watch it whenever I wanted. My favorite is Chloe. I always wished she and Clark would get together even though the age old story says it's Lois and Clark.

034580404X|5.0|The price was just right, I love that it came with all three books, and I couldn't be happier! Thank you!!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Of course Clint Eastwood plays another grouchy old man but what other role can they give him at this age and with his voice? You have to learn that nothing is as important as family in this movie and also that human ability and skill can never beat computers. I like the story line  and we watched it twice.
B008BWFP2W|1.0|This film is pointless, pornographic, and also boring.  It is surprising that such an elegant and accomplished actress as Binoche would allow herself to be viewed so unflatteringly. What a waste of her talents!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This was boring and I was glad when it was finished. I think there was an opportunity to make this a really good movie but it seems like they didn't know what to do with this story. The ending was done so that a Prometheus 2 could be made but there is no anticipation for it because you are already glad that it's over.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I pushed my husband to go to this movie and when we emerged, he agreed it was up there with the best!<br />Having been warned that the singing starts at the onset and never stops, I was worried that it would get old, but that was so far from the case. The story was told through the singing which is not easy to do. I feel that exactly the right actors/actresses where chosen for this film and have a new found respect for Jackman and Crowe.<br /><br />Because the show appeared to be a sellout, we had to sit 7 rows from the screen something I haven't done in as much as 40 years. The show was simply fabulous, unforgettable and endearing.  Ann Hathaway was spectacular and her crying face haunts me at times. This is one of the few films that I will see again, maybe on disc.<br /><br />Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|So boring and a very slow moving movie. Of course there were funny parts but not enough to make the movie good. I guess it could have been boring because the wife was bored and depressed in the movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Accurate and the info covers everything!!!  The fact that it's free, user friendly, and so extensive while having a great look blows my mind!!!
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|I liked this movie because I didn't figure it out. I hate when I can guess what is going on before it happens but this was a suprise when the answer came. I like the story line, the mystery and drama.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|very good game for not having to spend any money. it also can be played at a constant rate without much waiting.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|Yes,it was a pretty good movie to watch when there was nothing else to do on the weekend. Some of the same ole stuff with a different twist to it so if you like the other Bourne movies you will probably like this one too.
0061906220|5.0|When a book is asked for over and over...and your kiddo sings along everytime, well, you know you have a wonderful book. And this book, for us, is that book. The kiddo loves to shout the colors; sing the songs; and tells us what happens after the water.<br /><br />All in all - an excellent book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its great love it Bc its like mario. fun, easy s s s s s s ss ss s s s
141694737X|1.0|I am very disappointed in this book and I've decided not to read it to my toddler.  It's very negative...and points out that there's something wrong with each animal.  When the child receives each animal and finds the deficit, he/she sends them back.  Lame.
030758836X|4.0|After coming off of books like the trilogy of fifty shades of grey, thoughtless and effortless. I was disappointed at first. But the just as you are wondering why you are reading this book it becomes exciting and has twist and turns on every page. Just stick with it and you will love it.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I watched the series on the MTV website but when I saw the price I couldn't resist buying it. It's an interesting supernatural teen drama that has a great cast!

B004UNX1LS|2.0|It might be a decent app if it would stay open long enough to use. I have a brand new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 that is straight out of the box with default settings and it crashes every time I search for a video.
B000O1799U|1.0|This is a great movie, right from the beginning there is music and singing some of the best songs I've ever herd this movie has  great costumes and performances , and vivid color ,I give it 5 stars!.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|The lead singer's voice may take some getting used to in a Joanna Newsom sort of way, but after my first listen-through of the album, I kind of dig it. Musically, \\"An Awesome Wave\\" hits all the right notes with me (pun intended). It's complex, has some heavy beats you can't help but to find yourself moving to, and is almost as aurally satisfying as it gets. Absolutely worth the purchase. Time for me to listen to it again!<br /><br />EDIT 1/23/2013: I've been finding myself listening to this album over and over again! I normally NEVER do that, as I can't stand repetition and normally shuffle through my pretty vast array of music. There's a reason you're seeing a solid 5-star rating on this album here. It is freaking amazing! In my opinion, this has to be one of the best albums of all time. I could draw comparisons to other artists in attempt to describe it, but it would be unfair to Alt-J. Buy this album! You're going to love it!

B004QX07G4|5.0|Seriously...I'm Kidding -by Ellen DeGeneres<br /><br />Memoir<br />256 pages<br />footnotes/endnotes: Yes (* on page one and notes on page last)<br />Illustrations: Yes - line drawings made to color<br />Suitable for eReaders: Yes (read it on my Kindle)<br /><br />I am not a fan of talk shows, but I am a fan of Ellen DeGeneres. She's cute, she's funny, and she doesn't use put down humor - at least that I've seen. She is also, like Michael J. Fox, an incurable optimist. Since I do most of my reading at night, in bed, before sleep, I want something that won't give me nightmares when I turn off the lights, and if I get laughs in my dreams, so much the better.<br /><br />Ellen has a lot to say in this book. I haven't read her others, but they are now on my list. If it is possible to feel better for having read a book, I feel better for having read this one! This book is hilariously laugh out loud funny, it is uplifting, and there are a few nuggets of gold sprinkled throughout. Including, I think, The Secret. Since she shared it with her readers, I'm going to quote it here:<br /><br />\\"Happiness comes from within. You have the power to change your own mind-set so that all the negative, horrible thoughts that try to invade your psyche are replaced with happy, positive, wonderful thoughts.\\"  She goes on to state that, \\"Happiness is a journey, not a destination.\\"<br /><br />I have found both those statements, in one form or another, to be true. Also true is that, \\"Happiness is a choice, and not always an easy one!\\" by Richard Bach<br /><br />So if you need a little happiness in your life (and who doesn't?) get a copy of this book and read it. The chapters are just the right length to read while sitting in the Throne Room;-)<br /><br />Need a good escape? Read, Seriously...I'm Kidding! Need a bunch of laughs? Read, Seriously...I'm Kidding! Need answers to life's niggling questions? Read, uh wait, Seriously...I'm Kidding;-)
B003Y5H54W|4.0|From the adds on TV, I had no desire to see this.  It appeared to be a blood fest film, or something like that.  When I was ordering varrious movies for Christmas presents, I saw this was on special, so I bought it.  I have always been a wolf-man fan.  This turned out to be a very different approach and reasonable well done.  There are two endings, both fine.  I enjoyed the first one I saw first more...but that is personal taste.  I won't say which it was..
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|OK a fun free game.  It can be a good time waster, but does get old quick.  If you want to really advance your game it will cost you actual cash or time (and I mean a lot of time).  I will be keeping it and playing for now.  It is an enjoyable game if only without the addition add on at the addition price.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So glad I chose to read this book.  Based on the reviews I did not hurry to flip to the ending when it started to drag.  This was one of the best books I've read for a long time.  I will and have recommended this to my friends.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|A very enjoyable game that will keep you replaying to improve each time and special things to find.  Thus I very stuck on this on game.  I have to keep putting it down so I can make it last.  It does show additional levels will becoming some day, which I'm sure will cost something, but it will be well worth it.  A game that keeps me wanting to play and laughing the all the time as well as being free is on the top of my must have list for everyone in my book.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|This is a pretty good album.  I don't think any of the songs have the same staying power as &#34;Sleepyhead&#34; or that other song on the first album that I kind of liked.  That said, it's still good.  It appears I'm in the minority regarding &#34;Take a Walk,&#34; though.  I think that song sucks.

I have to admit, however, for me this is a purchase for sentimental reasons and I was very glad to find it.<br /><br />I imagine the back cover still shows the woman with blue eyes and black hair held in chains in a range of fire. For trivia, it is said that this was a watercolor sent to Leonard: from a gifted mental patient. There is a lot of information about her online and Leonard Cohen if you search for Leonard Cohen and the artist mental patient.<br /><br />I am terribly sorry I cannot remember her name. I do not wish to dishonor her by saying it wrong.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|If you have a fear of monkeys, you probably shouldn't watch this.  It's probably the most terrifying portrayal of primates since those flying monkeys in &#34;The Wizard of Oz,&#34; who were also scary.<br /><br />The only flaw in this movie is the lack of Mark Wahlberg.
0765325950|5.0|Finishing this book felt like saying goodbye to my oldest friends. The series has been with me all throughout high school and helped me through some hard times. It was bittersweet to finally see them go for the last time, but they went out in the best way they could have.<br /><br />Goodbye friends.
B000002VMD|5.0|Love the movie and listening to the Bodyguard CD makes you re-live this fine movie.<br />Every song on the CD is great.  The Best.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Its pretty good, so far, although haven't finished reading it..some parts are slow.  Maybe it will get better by the end.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love how you can set your own music up to come on.  I have skipped the ipod craze but admired that clock radio feature.  With this app I 'm not missing waking up to my own music.  I did have trouble getting this app to launch my Internet radio app. I haven't tried to launch other apps with this feature.  Overall very happy!
B00013M6NK|1.0|I bought this item specifically because it is a Nikon EN-EL5. I have one that came with my Coolpix and it is still in good shape but I needed one extra for my trips. Unfortunately, I recharged it, didn't take much time and the recharger - that came with my Coolpix - showed that the battery was fully charged. When I put it in the camera and tried to zoom in, next thing the screen shows that 'Battery exhausted&#34;. I plug it again in the charger, didn't take much - 10 min maximum - showed that battery was charged. I put it back in the camera, same thing happens again! I thought, this is an advertised original brand from a trusted company; I got a piece of junk not even worth getting it for free!
B008LV8TSU|4.0|A ltitle more juvenile than I would want but still interesting.  I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
B002RI9HUM|3.0|Well, i have read a lot of Marian Keyes books, and i must say this was a good read.....funny and light, with just a bit of drama thrown in for good measure!  It's about a woman who has an addiction, who doesn't think she has one, and meets many new and interesting people in a rehab facility that she thought was a fancy hollywood type spa facility.  The humor as always is typical Keyes, and all in all an enjoyable read!.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Definitely not Harry Potter but a pretty good picture of the pettiness of small town politics.  I guess they are the same whether in England or the US
B005D63ICI|5.0|I would highly recommend to anyone who loved the first four seasons as much as I did. It gets even better in the following season!
0765325950|5.0|This review is for the Audiobook, narrated by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. First though, I must say, I really don't like that people are using a product review avenue to vent their frustration with Harriet and TOR. Send a letter to the publisher if you have an issue as it does nothing to help those wanting to know if the book (as in the content) is worth picking up.<br /><br />I am not done with the book yet, but all of these e-book complaints are frustrating to see. I'm confused, everyone seems to be a big fan and has been waiting on this last book for a long time, so why not just have a little more patience and pick up another book while you wait for a few months. TOR did come to a compromise and cut back the 1-yr delay. I understand that not having the option is very frustrating, but have some respect for one of the best authors and series of our time. I'm sure we all have wives/husbands/others that have gone and done something stupid on our behalf, right? Why punish a man who can't defend himself? My suggestion would be to get the audiobook instead. I bought both the hardcover book and the audiobook and I'm enjoying both, but the audiobook takes the story to another level.<br /><br />I am rating the audiobook quality and the story a complete 5 out of 5. Michael and Kate are simply two of the best narrators to date and I have enjoyed listening to them for the whole series. There is just something about the way they narrate, I literally got goosebumps when the audiobook started. I highly recommend picking up the whole audiobook series and giving it a listen either to catch yourself up or just enjoy the story again. Sanderson's Way of Kings is also narrated by them and is by far my favorite audiobook!<br /><br />Concluding, this is not the correct place to vent your frustrations, it is disrespectful to Robert Jordan's legacy and to the actual content of the book. For those interested, MOL (as far as I've read/listened) is amazing and I recommend grabbing your preferred (available) copy and finishing out a great series.referred (available) copy and finishing out a great series.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This is a weird case in which I prefer the movie to the book. The story in itself is interesting and it definitely wants to portray a message about women's abuse over time.<br />Regarding the kindle format, it doesn't have real page numbers at it said it would.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|As a senior citizen, I am always interested in new ways to make myself remember - and this book is written more like a novel and is surprisingly helpful in the understanding of how and why things work for some folks.  I have several other books on methods to help remember things,but this is the best one yet!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was very well written and kept me on my toes until the very end. I really enjoyed the plot and the characters really come to life!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The Fault In Our Stars.  I found the book interesting but appealing to a high school age person more than an adult.  I am not a fan of depressing books,
0307887448|5.0|Listened to it on Audible (read by Wil Wheaton), and it's amazing. Especially for those that love the 80s, games, movies, series and rock n' roll. It's almost impossible to stop reading. I call it the best book ever for geeks.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Love this app.  I have it on my phone (android) and my kindle.  Has everything I want.  Current conditions plus.  If the app is huge I wouldn't know because I have lots of room so I am not affected by lack of space issues.  If not the best one of the best I've seen yet.  Highly recommended.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This guy is a lyrical genius, down to earth and the beats are AMAZING (Ryan Lewis) These guys are gonna go FAR!
B005LAIH54|5.0|This was better than the Clash of Titans... love Mads Mikkelson, and Sam Worthington and the CGI... amazeballs can't wait for their next movies!!
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton once again keeps one enthralled as the plot thickens. Just when you think all is revealed, another piece to the puzzle is revealed. If you like British authors you will love Morton's books.Romance, mystery and believable characters are her forte.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I didn't even know that Sam Worthington was in this movie for the longest time.  He's one of my favorite actors... he looks like my boyfriend a little bit..
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Loved it; great story,  Twists and turns were very interesting.  And the idea was unique and creative; well done, Lasse
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Love Sam Worthington's cool persona in all his movies, and the powerful personality of Mads Mikkelson.. truly both iconic actors..
B008KPDYQY|1.0|A Nicholas Stoller with Jason Segel movie seemed like a good choice. Their track record is amazing. However, this two and a half hour movie felt like weeks. The plot line isn't focused, it isn't funny on any level and doesn't seem to have a point.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|If you're looking for theological edification, this is not the book to read. if you're reading it or analyzing it theologically, you're missing the point. If you want to laugh, you'll like this book. &#34;Good Omens&#34; is an apocalypse of lunacy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome. I saw the movie and loved it. It was great to read the book and get insight on what was going through Katniss`s mind at certain instances.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|The DVD came in great condition, as expected but the movie sucked.  It is NOTHING like the first one at all.  So if that is what you are expecting... don't get it.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford & Sons never disappoint. Such a great cd - great music, great lyrics. One of the best among my cd collection!
B005LAII80|5.0|The best film and most overlooked of 2012.This is a next generation Dirty Harry,only hell of a lot tougher and 10 times meaner.The 3D has been put to good use for once and actually enhances the movie not just there as a gimmick.You can tell that a lot of love has been put into this film by all concerned as it shows from the gritty and often all too realistic visuals (heads and hands exploding along with bullets passing through peoples bodies in lovely slow motion).The story never gives you a break from being on the edge of your chair from start to finish only slowing down for the final scene which without giving anything away is one of the most striking bits of film i've seen in years.A must for any action fan.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|too much of the same, very repetitive but was told to persivere so read all 3 glad i did ,
B0026KX4HS|2.0|We've seen the movie before and it is a great movie, however the picture quality was awful. I paid for the HD version hoping it would be good quality but it wasn't. I was highly disappointed in that aspect.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|i think book two is better than book one, not so muche repitition in the sex parts, more of a story to it, and a bit more insite in to his background
0553328255|5.0|This set is exactly what I was expecting when I made the purchase.<br />Fans of the series or those just starting out should both be impressed by the two book set.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|this is the best of the three, really builds the story and answers questions, love a good ending , .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How to even begin writing a review for this book? I'm not sure but I'm going to try.<br />It's really hard because the best parts of the book are the ones I can't talk about because I don't want to spoil anything! What fun would that be for you? I want you to experience what I got to while reading through this book.<br />Therefore if this review seems lame or inadequate, I apologize. It's not for lack of trying but for not being able to tell you much.<br /><br />The Cover:<br />I just had to put a short note in about the cover. I thought it was AMAZING before I read the book and now that I know what all the elements mean, it is just spectacular! Sarah Hansen did an amazing job, as always.<br /><br />The Plot:<br />I loved the pace of things being revealed. The whole time I was reading it I was waiting for that HUGE twist that everyone was talking about. I was definitely looking out for it more than I would've if I didn't know it was there so I picked up on a few things. BUT I totally didn't guess the major surprise. It was awesome riding the discovery journey with Skye as she finds out about her past.<br /><br />The Characters:<br />Breckin was an amazing supporting character. I seriously wanted to take him as my own GBF! Completely awesome and supportive and a constant for Sky.<br />Sky was an extremely strong character. She goes through a lot but holds herself together. One of my favorite things about her that I can tell you is her indifference. I loved the parts where kids were pulling pranks on her at school and she just went on with life. She didn't give them the time of day and that in itself shows how strong she is.<br />Holder. Ummm how do I talk about him. He's just perfect for Sky. Definitely not a perfect person- he makes mistakes and throws some tantrums but he has way more positive attributes. He definitely has the bad boy appearance with the soft inside going for him. I like how Sky describes him in the book- passionate. That's the perfect word for him.<br /><br />The Relationship:<br />It was so incredibly sweet. They definitely had their bumps but they were able to stick it out. I loved the sarcastic remarks throughout. They made me LOL occasionally. (yes, I just put LOL in a review) They both go through trauma that no one should ever have to experience but they help each other through it. They are there for each other when the other is ready to let down the barrier and just cry it out. Also I'm going to have to try the Dinner Quest game out. It sounds like fun :)<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book. I really can't think of anything that I didn't enjoy about it. You should definitely read it if this is your thing but be prepared there is some emotional heaviness and tissues might be needed!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I enjoy it already. Finished putting my camera equipment into it and still have plenty of room.<br />Recommended for others camera users.
B0039HR5QS|4.0|Very good and entertaing movie!  Redford is great.  If you like movies like All the Presidents Men and similar movies of this era, you will enjoy this one.
B0068853O6|5.0|Excellent all-around television. This mini-series doesn't have the gold standard reputation of Band of Brothers, but it's awfully close. A great production.
1616960922|5.0|Sanderson's head is so full of stuff, I don't know how he makes it to the bathroom on his own- and I mean this in a GOOD way!  This is more of a novella, but I wish it were more.  The story potential is astronomical- it gives you enough detail to be clear, but gives enough mystery to really hook you in.  Sanderson is a lover of the long and complicated, but it really works for him.  There's not a lot of wasted space or meaningless prose, and his secondary world creation is almost unparallelled- he makes JRR Tolkein look like a chump.  There is no doubt that Sanderson weilds the power of his raw, unmitigated talent with the force of Thor's hammer.  Though this is just a small sample, the quality is definitely there.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book kept me interested the entire time! This was a great book that I would recommend should be 're as d!
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This is a fabulous movie.it was really funny, Quality was very good for a used DVD. I would recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I laughed when someone funny happened, and cried when something bad happened. I just couldn't put this book down. It was truly amazing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read most of John Grisham's books  I really liked  The Racketeer.  I have never read one I didn't like. The books are not filled with sex & viloence. When I start one,  I cannot put it down. My next book will be Calico Jo.  Alice Mc Call

0345803493|5.0|Fantastic reading, great imaginative thinking and composition.  E. L. James did a fantastic job of keeping the story going.  Fantastic!
B000NQRE1E|4.0|I'm one of the few who didn't see Titanic in the theater when it came out but I liked it a lot on VHS and DVD. The Jack & Rose romance seemed a little bit unlikely but wasn't bad. I was always more interested in the &#34;look&#34; of the story and the extreme level of detail put into the movie.<br />I always wondered why a movie that would look so good on Blu ray wasn't released in that format, and felt I ought to get a copy now that it is out. The included extras should be great.
0345803507|5.0|Once again, the composition and imaginative writing was outstanding!  I have the longing for the publishing of another book by E L James.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|If you are not ready to wrap you mind around some old time literature don't pick this up.  Hard read
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This app is very good because there are tons of levels and its not too easy and not too hard! It's perfect I highly recommend this app!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was amazing. It was so sad yet motivational. It proves there is hope out there. Loved it from start to finish! The love story was well written too.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game it like playing it on an xbox or something the only thing I dont like is the fact that I had to return my first fire because of a defect and when I got my new one I had to star all over but besides that freaking awesome
B0068FZ1AU|5.0|The product included the Blu-ray movie, a DVD and Digital Copy.  This is a great value and all the options mean I can play this when and where I want to.  I love the movie and really enjoy the music it is from.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|You and your teenage kids will enjoy this movie - there are a few spots that may not be appropriate but the movie overall is a great option for Friday / Saturday night with your teens.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Although the song \\"fade into you\\" is not on the CD, you can download (see below)the individual mp3 separately:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Fade-Into-You/dp/B00A29S7HM/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1357777598&sr=1-1&keywords=fade+into+you
B0098VXBIA|5.0|A great movie for those planning or have already planned to start a family.  Humor and content was spot on.
B00917IQFY|4.0|I think the expectations from fans were so high for this album, that it made it nearly impossible for Graham Parker and the Rumour to meet them, thus I understand some of the negative reviews from disappointed fans. I actually like this album, but I have to agree that it doesn't have the fire and intensity of a \\"Howlin' Wind\\" or \\"Squeezing Out Sparks.\\" But hey, few albums have such magic, so should we really expect Graham Parker to amaze us all over again? But the frustrating part, is that we know he's still capable of doing just that. The solo albums he's released in the past decade have almost all been great ones. For this reunion with the Rumour we get some good new tunes, but nothing to really get ultra excited about. Yes, it does grow on you with repeated listenings, but I don't think it truly boasts any GP classics. The hooks are mostly subtle ones, and GP's songs still have that familiar lyrical bite and relevance. Bonus points for the last track, \\"Last Bookstore in Town.\\" Being a bookshop owner myself, this is a song that really resonates with me. While this one won't rank among my favorite Graham Parker albums, there's enough on here to make me happy, and I think anyone else who's kept up with GP over recent decades will also like this album.
B008NABUU8|4.0|The game is addictive, but the whole game can be played in a sitting. Needs a little more to make it a worth while buy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As usual Rick Riordan immediately captures your imagination. Once you start reading the newest edition to the series, you won't be able to put it down.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|The game is fun, but you get the gist of it within the first play. There is little to look forward to and RadRules was a better game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very helpful and helps to be able to access anything and everything on my phone, tablet, and laptop! Allowsme tomake to do and shopping lisys without wasting paper (going green) and can take just my phone or my yablet and keep eveything in order.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love Gillian Flynn's writing.  She has such a way with words.  This also had a lot of topics for a book club discussion.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's really great.  Lots of fun.  The graphics are really awesome on the Kindle HD.  Try it, you'll like it.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Can't access Google Drive despite allegedly having this feature. Right after downloading it says there's a newer version to download, and if you click it, it dumps you off in the app store, as though you're going to give them another $.99 just moments after buying it. So basically, it's a scam.
B008476HBM|5.0|Very insightful and fun.  Easy to relate to the issues the parents face.  The two leads make great role models.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Awesome movie!!! Fat Amy was HILLARIOUS! Had some great songs and a pretty good story line. Definitely a good mix of music as well, both older and newer songs!
B0089XH38M|4.0|for free, i would say it's great and i will recommend this to my friends..very good deal. and it does work.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|After downloading this product , I still cannot use some apps that use adobe flash player to operate. I am lost on this app.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I have loved Kelly since she won AI. She has a fantastic voice. Such a strong singer and she is not afraid to be herself. I do wish she would stay a brunette though. Obviously nothing to do with her music, just a more flattering look for her.
B007704HO6|5.0|A very nice book, 100% recomended, it captured me  because is a refreshing history, and when you have a cat you know that is true.
0345803493|3.0|Ditto as for the final book. I have read better stories, that is for sure.  I just didn't get all the hoopla over these.
B002I9Z8I0|3.0|Just what we wanted, the old VHS movies on disk. No Blu-Ray for us! These old movies hold lots of holiday memories.
0345803507|3.0|I have read all of these books, because I was curious to see what all the hype was about. They are a quick read, but I found them to be a little juvenile in the wording and substance. I would consider these to be soft porn. Not for teens, and way too descriptive for what is going on. If these are going to be made into a movie series, like the Twilight books, they will have to be toned way down as far as the sexual content,unless someone intends making them into porno movies.
B009NOVCTM|3.0|Edited versions are disappointing.  I would rather have seen an elimination of a song or two in favor of the full track.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Murakami leads the reader into a totally different world of fantasy which appears more believable than reality. I couldn't put it down ...
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I am a fan of Jodi Picoult and was again not disappointed in her books.  Would recommend for others to read.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My husband and I watched at least two episodes each day and loved them all.  Can't wait to get Season 2.
B005H29GSI|3.0|The kids seem to like it. I guess it's ok, I haven't seen them play with it much at all.
B000JZ68GG|5.0|This is an all time favorite that I love more every time I see it. Jane Fonda is a total babe, and the outfits she sports are out of this world, literally.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|This is the movie that I was looking for and at a great price with prompt service.  However I had wanted a DVD rather than VHS. Had not noticed whether it said or not. My bad.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I so looked forward to getting this book and it did not disappointed.  I didn't want to put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Touching book, easy to get into and I couldn't put it down after I got half way through. The suspense kept me up past midnight!
1440503257|5.0|Review
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I installed this one because I am a teacher and thought my high-school students would enjoy it. They really do!! It uses handwritten character recognition, which it converts to actual numbers and pretty accurately too! There's a little learning curve but once you get used to it, it is really handy and neat!<br /><br />One note: with my capacitive touch screen, it works much better with my finger than with a stylus.<br /><br />Bottom line: get it!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Bought this for my brother and he loved it, its awesome, i also enjoy it, what a fantastic movie ø
0316789798|5.0|I remember getting Ed Emberley books from the library as a kid, and having to wait my turn to check one out. Getting this book for my son for Christmas brought back the memories, and it's so fun to watch him enjoying the drawings. He feels like quite the little artist, learning to draw from shapes. He's six and has found ways to use shapes to do his own things outside the book, too.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Well i have a girlfriend who never got to play games as a child because her stepbrothers were evil, so i hooked her up with a butt load of games and all that was missing was the memory card which you supplied. Its fantastic we are making memories thanks to a memory card. Much Love.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Amazing. Beautiful. I can't wait to see what they have done with the movie. Very inspiring to someone on search of silver linings.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie! Very uplifting. Gives you a better appreciation for acapella. Also good motivator for those just starting their college experience.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not your average heroine who is brave and just but a realistically painted young women who is a mirror of the world she lives in: imperfect, lost and fragile. A great but also bittersweet ending to a most intriguing trilogy.
141659521X|5.0|My husband is a huge fan of Vince Flynn's books.  He loved this one as much as the others he's read.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|One of the best tv series ever, Firefly by Joss Whedon, was so much fun to watch that it was a shame that it all ended too soon - Fox tv execuitives are totally clueless. But the big budget feature film provided one last adventure that was truly exciting, and it was great to see all the old characters again. This movie can be watched as a stand-alone thrilling film with excellent pacing and editing. But I would highly recommend that you go back and watch the short tv series that expanded the characters with the format that the weekly show allowed - you will not be disappointed. I loved star trek and the brilliant new 2002 battestar galactica, but for pure fun Firefly could not be surpassed.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is a great film!  This copy was given as a gift, so I think the recipient liked it.  Hope so!
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|Many recordings of the greatest conductor of the 20th century, though some air checks are missing, notably Schubert Symphony #2, a wonderful performance, and Schumann #  2, the most vital and coherent performance I have ever heard.  The presto mvt is at an unbelievable tempo that speeds up. The string are totally together. The audience applauds even in the middle of a symphony conducted by Toscanini.  Also there's a great Magic Flute from 1937 (?) at Salzburg. Wonderful again. Many of the tempos are different from today's performances, regularly slower than we hear, today.  In some cases these tempi line up with the recordings of the arias by 19th century singers like Pol Plancon, for example. Most interesting! This collection is a must for anyone who loves classical music--performances by one of the greatest, most honest and most accomplished conductors in history. Bravo Toscanini!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Exactly what I wanted came in quick. Watched all and plan to watch again and again. Would recommend to friends.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This trilogy was such an excellent piece of writing and I wish Mr. Larsson was still alive to write more book.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|While there is a murder to solve at the center of this story, it is so much more than just a murder mystery.  Characters are fully developed and their connections and history are so interesting that you often forget that someone was murdered or wonder who did it.  Great introduction to a very isolated area of the world, the Hebrides off the northwest coast of Scotland.
B004LROUW2|5.0|What a wonderful story line.  It kept me in suspense the entire book and I will read more of Murakami.
B003O86FMW|3.0|You revisit the same characters and they end up in a very similar situation as book one.  The games provide the tension, though, so I guess that's why Collins falls back on it yet again.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I enjoyed the reading of this series, but I didn't like the way the chapters bounced around to another character each time.  Made it somewhat hard to concentrate on the action of the series.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is one of our favorites, the tunes are very catchy - and we love the story line, Nice for a relaxing evening!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I usually rate Tom Clancy's novels as very good when he is sole author.  The novel, when co-authored, is not pure Tom Clancy.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Not as good as Delirium; the chapters moving from past to present was a bit confusing at first and keeping the two story lines separate made this not as &#34;bath tub reading&#34; friendly.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love the well researched details that a book of this kind must include.<br />Grisham books are always edgy, fast paced and have a surprise around every segment of the tale.<br />Thanks JG.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|This easy to read novel, targeted toward a younger audience, in the spirit of The Hunger Games and the Divergent Trilogy, identifies the struggle of the main character to be herself and go against society to live her life the way she feels it suits her is an admirable quality that is seldom seen.
B00631VJIC|5.0|It came earlier than expected in the mail and the person who received it as a gift loved it so much she listens to it everyday!!!
0440242401|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Finished it in one sitting. Easy fun read. The only downfall is you how it will end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really good book!  Sad a bit in the ending...but it relates to real life...sometimes there is not a \\" they all live happily ever after\\"
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Not sure I can say anything that hasnt been said.<br /><br />I think the casting is wonderful. I must say, usually when I read the books first, I am annoyed that the characters in the film/show look nothing like what I pictured; thats not the case here.<br /><br />Pretty happy overall with this adaptation.
B008X9Z37A|2.0|Was a little bit disappointed with it. Thought it was going to be a bit more sturdy and zip up. My husband found this, so I went with what he picked. It's for our grandson who needs something more reliable..... Will try to find something better later... I would not buy again...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|definitely glad I bought this game. glad it allows you to play free to see if it's worth buying and would like to see more games follow that idea. $3 is worth the entertainment recieved.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is interesting an completely addicting. the levels are not difficult at all an it really gets a person thinking. Good thing it's free.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Excellent movie.  You can't go wrong with real dinosaurs.  Bought for my 8 year-old.  I remember this movie being really exciting and it still is.  Great family entertainment.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|These puzzles require skill and cunning, on my part.  Some of them, I breeze through with ease.  Most of the time my aim is not as good as my intentions to destroy the cover of those nasty little pigs.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|Bought this for my 7 year-old and he loves it.  Now it looks like I need to get the series that this movie leads into.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy, I read the whole thing in three days. I just couldn't manage to put it down. There were just a couple spacing errors but other than that, these books are perfection.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I forgot it was him. 'Nough said.  Emily blunt does a wonderful performance of a strong mother with the world on her shoulders.  But the actor that steals the movie is the little boy, hands down.  Plot is unique, I did not see the movie taking the turn that it did and that says a lot.
B008HK3SFO|4.0|Stylish and nice, it keeps my Kindle Fire modestly protected.  The device slides in and out easily.  I just wish it didn't have Velcro fastenings.  When I'm in class or in a meeting everyone turns and stares at the Velcro &#34;rip&#34; when I get my Kindle out.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|Both actors do a wonderful job.  Story is cute, funny, brutal, sad, and hopeful.  I will definitely watch again and I recomend it.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Great soundtrack for those of us who loved the film.  The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is the fact that there is a LOT of music that is not included.  I would have loved to get the 'complete' soundtrack instead.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It seemed formulaic.  You can see where the plot is going from a mile away.  You might as well watch an episode of Family guy and save yourself an hour.
0756405890|5.0|I stumbled onto this book on my cell phone's amazon app before a flight and downloaded it to read on the plane...<br /><br />This was the most enjoyment I have had in reading a book. I enjoy Fantasy and Sci fi, and the name of the wind was more fun than Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Farseer Trilogy, etc.. It was on par or better than Ender's Game. Ender's game is Sci Fi, but similarily, it is about a young prodigy boy who feels estranged... I wish more fantasy writers could have the same level of character depth and world-building ability as Rothfuss.<br /><br />The sequel wasn't quite as good as book 1, but it was still AWESOME, as well... I have some friends who thought book two was actually better because it had more action and scenery, but I didn't feel the same.<br /><br />If you like Fanstasy READ THIS BOOK.<br />If you like first person fiction READ THIS BOOK.<br />If you like Harry Potter READ THIS BOOK.<br />If you like Ender's Game READ THIS BOOK.<br />If you like The Wheel of Time series READ THIS BOOK.<br />If you like to READ then READ THIS BOOK.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Then I watched it again and it was just okay.  I lost interest mid way but I love Jeremy Renner and that kept me through for the rest of the movie.
B004BLTNL6|4.0|This movie is violent and very disturbing.  Still, Joe Bob Briggs provides one of my favorite commentaries of all time.  He argues that the movie does not exploit women, but rather is a testament to their power.  That commentary alone is worth the ten bucks or so.  Better yet, find the two pack with the remake and see how superior this version is.
B005H29GSI|5.0|This game was everything stated in the description. My 6 year old grandson has not stopped playing it since Christmas morning. Pieces are small enough to be portable, but not too tiny for little hands and sturdy. An overall good product.
B0089BSM70|5.0|Loved this edition on blu-ray.  Almost an hour long documentary that does not feel short changed even without Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter's participation.  Two great commentaries as well.  Recommended if you watch the extras...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the new bridges version is a lot of fun too.  i'd recommend this to anyone wanting to kill some time with a fun game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i enjoyed this game. good graphics. fun story line. fun mini games.a little challenging but not enough to bog down. i enjoyed the interaction in the game too.<br /><br />.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|taylor swift does it again,  she never disappoints.  the album is great, just like all of her other work.  excited about her next album to come out
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Some parts of the book are very predictable. It's not bad, but ordinary. A good book to read in a rainy thursday!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the app.  similar to mobile version.  works great.  would recommend to all who love pinterest.  and anyone who doesnt know about pinterest, download the app and get with it
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The author beautifully captures a segment of life in Ireland and the Irish dialect \\"as she is spoke\\". It is an easy read with much humour, sadness and food-for-thought. It pinpoints the atrocious institution of the orphanage as it was. And for the language buff, there's a good number of delicious Malapropisms! For this mix, I give the author a five for her first novel.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|i just hate that she's back with her beating boyfriend.  it is clear that most of the album is written to him
B004LSO6YI|1.0|This movie was so bad I couldn't even get through it. How in the world anyone can rate this and it garners 4 and half stars is beyond me. I cringed the entire time I watched it. Another horrible endeavor from Nicole Conn. Honestly, how does she get funding for her films? They are SO bloody awful it's beyond words. Stilted storylines, terrible dialogue. Mediocre acting at best. It just all felt so forced. I made it as far as the first kiss and stopped it. I just couldn't even go any further. The kissing was devoid of passion, close lipped. It was bad.<br /><br />Honestly, rent Lip Service from the UK or almost anything else. Avoid Nicole Conn films unless you like to cringe. This is quite possibly THE worst lesbian film I've ever seen...aside from Claire of the Moon, Conn's other film. Yeegads.
B005XI9456|4.0|Good holiday album.  Typical Bieber, if you like his music, you'll enjoy this album.  It was worth the money.  I'd recommend it.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|This documentary was well done and interesting. It offers a glimpse into the life of Katy Perry. I was ambivalent about her before watching this with my kids. I'm now a fan and wish her the best as she continues to engage in the trials and tribulations of the music business and the difficult path of trying to maintain some normalcy and find happiness in her personal life.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|love angry birds, but totally addictive.  if you can keep yourself under control, you'll be fine.  fun times for all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked idea of a first hand account of the men and events that led up to the operation.  I also like the story of the author and his journey to the SEAL 6 team.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's rare that a show continues the quality it started with into the 3rd season but Walking Dead does it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|No, I don't give a five this is a 100 points! book, it is for any age, OMG! so many good lessons to learn and practice!!<br />love it!!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have a very short attention span.  I have put down some books because they doesn't catch my attention from the very beginning and I either take a long time to finish them or don't finish them at all. This book had my undivided attention since the first page.  It had all the ingredients I like in a book, action, suspense, mystery, funny but at the same time sad.  The main character, a professional hit man, is good at his job but at the same time compassionate when it comes to the innocent.  I had never read any books by Mr. Baldacci but I have read three now (almost finished reading The Forgotten) and enjoyed all of them.
B0002HZHXG|5.0|My kid (2yrs old) loves these so we bought enough for all hist trucks.  Batteries included which is also a plus.
B004TI5N38|5.0|First book I've read by David Baldacci and I truly and honestly enjoyed.  I've downloaded some books which I later regret but not this one.  Agent Puller, the main character, is not only relentless but also a risk taker to accomplish his mission.  He cares deeply for the people he is trying to protect from harm.  If you love action and suspense, you will absolutely love this book.  It had me glued to it from the very beginning!
B005PK553C|5.0|Season one: Campy, quirky, and utterly addictive!  Well acted and well crafted.<br />Jessica Lange shines as deranged mother straight out of Tennessee Williams.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|I give it only 4 stars because the story slowed down at the end. If you appreciate the male form, you should definitely watch this! If you're shy about guys and think only women should show off their bodies, this movie is NOT for you.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|This is a fine and extremely suspenseful film adaptation of Susan Hill's stellar gothic novel of the same name. The setting of Hill's story fairly oozes with atmosphere, and the film captures the creepy yet romantic vibe really well. Radcliffe is near perfect in the lead role as a grieving widower and young father.  On a side note, I was disappointed with the way the screenplay departs from the novel in places, especially at the end, but this is still a film I will revisit as it is high caliber movie-making and I adore the setting and drama the film presents.  I also highly recommend reading Hill's original novel--one of the top gothic literary works in my book...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway suffers. is a great game I have made high scores with friends theirs people. to unlock. friends make high scores. you have goals
B0076DELIG|5.0|I really love the Harry Bosch novels and this was another really good one. If you likle Michael Connelly's books you will love this one.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|Best case for the Kindle Fire!!  It protects the kindle without being bulky.  (I leave the top unzipped when I want to charge, so always in the case when not in use.)
B0087EVHVW|4.0|You do have to buy your own thermal compound with this it doesn't come preaplyed with the heatsink. so save yourself the extra shipping time and buy it when you buy this.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Really enjoyable series.  Improves from season to season as the characters are more developed.  Highly recommend it for relaxing  entertainment.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|I have seen the other HALO movie, I thought this was slow, acting was terrible. I also realize that there's no comparison to the full-length animated movie
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is a great police type series.  The characters are likeable and its generally not very violent.  It's a nice way to relax.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is incredible. I didn't think it was possible to play an MMORPG on a tablet, let alone a kindle, but Gameloft rose to the challenge and produced Order &amp;Chaos. You are able to create your own character, race, and class. Multiple quests, countless weapons and armors. This game is like a smaller version of World Of Warcraft or RuneScape. My only complaints are that updates aren't often (I couldn't play for about 2-3 weeks) and the enemies can and will attack you in groups, but that's where my rants end. Gameloft did keep their traddition &quot;pay for a certain currency and get better equipment.&quot; but it's not as necessary on this game. Overall this is a fantastic game. Several hours have been lost to this game, but totally worth it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved reading this thriller, page turner with surprises at the end of every chapter. I was hoping however for a more justified ending, slightly disappointing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I almost gave up on this book, but was encouraged to keep reading as there were big twists coming.  OK, there are some pretty good twists, so if you start this book, don't give up on it too quickly.  The author got me to commit to the characters and really feel their stress.  Really hooked me.  But for the ending, it seems the author runs out of steam and just gives up.  Feel like I wasted my time.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love the Hobbit :) The music is really epic and classical, it portrays the movie well. The mystic mountain song is the best.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Even if you aren't a dog lover, I believe you will love this story.  Warm, funny, happy and sad.  Will count this as one of my favorites.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Written by my 11year old... This book started out a bit slow, but soon it blossomed into an amazing book just like the Garden itself. I'd recommend this book to anyone with patience and imagination. From an author, this is a book one is drawn into.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|I ordered this case from Amazon two years ago and got one with a belt clip and magnetic closure.  Well, I recently lost that case b/c I took it off my belt and put it aside and then lost it.  The belt clip never failed or slipped off despite what others may have experienced. Anyways, so I wanted to replace that case. I found this item and Amazon told me that I had ordered this exact same item back in 2010 (they display that info at the top of the page whenever you reorder something you have already ordered). So I thought I'll just order it again since I had liked it so much. When my new case arrived I was very surprised to see that the belt clip is gone and the magnetic closure has been replaced by a velcro one.  So warning to anyone expecting a belt clip, this new case does not have one!  I see now that Amazon has updated the item description to omit the belt clip and mention the velco closure but they are wrong to tell me that this is the exact same item I had ordered previously, it certainly is not the same, and as a result I feel somewhat misled.  FYI, I would give the old case 5 stars.  This new case looks fairly strong, but is of little use without a belt clip.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The writing is exquisite, almost spiritual.  I recommend this book highly.  Haven't seen the movie, but I hope it sticks to the book's feel.
B002ZFQD0E|1.0|Here we go with another artist trying to make \\"art\\". What a piece of crap! I thought this might be something similar to her other works, but no even close.  :o(
B00APACSJG|4.0|Things fall into place a little too easy for Miles this time. I missed the usual complexity she presents. Still, it is a satisfying romp.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the only place I go for creative ideas now.  We used to have to open website after website searching for things.  This simplifies the process.
1439156816|5.0|This is a must read if you are a fan of King or looking for some inspiration to jump start your own writing. This guy blends his on personal life story with sagely advice in a way that leaves you wondering why this isn't staple reading in college creative writing classes.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|I'm a big fan of movies that are based on true events. This was very inspirational, motivational, and I thoroughly enjoyed how the range of characters were portrayed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've played. a lot of games - but none worthy of wasting my time to rate. I have an anxious personality & played this for the first time right before bed - I was instantly relaxed - which is saying a lot for me.  I highly recommend this game & am proud to give it 5 stars &  recommend it.
B0057ZAA6W|4.0|I like Ewan McGregor and this movie is usually mentioned when describing his particularly more memorable roles, so I finally purchased it after hearing of it for years.<br />I'd heard it was a bit strange, so I was prepared.<br />I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would!<br />Sure...there are some weird images, but I felt the film had a good linear narrative.  It kept me engaged--largely due to Ewan's excellent performance and in wanting to learn what becomes of his character!  Mark Renton (Ewan) may not be someone you directly relate to, but his bumpy journey toward cleaning up and striving to be a \\"normal\\" person creates a connection easy enough!<br />I cared less for the stories of his mates, but their parts were quite essential in understanding their influence on Mark & why he made some of the decisions he did.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this!
B0086700CM|1.0|My son enjoyed this game the night we downloaded it, but while he played it for several hours that evening, it hasn't worked since and we have had to delete it from my phone. It caused the phone to lock up twice.
B004LWZWBU|3.0|It was entertaining and made for a low keyed &#34;movie night&#34; with some friends.  I would only recommend it to someone who was into birdwatching though.
0765325950|1.0|this is starting to go viral, and I see no good reason to stop.  I can't believe they don't have an ebook version!  I'll edit my review once I've read the ebook.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I was expecting low brow humor. I got the low brow, just not the humor. I love a good blue comedy. This is not it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I love this DVD as I am a big long time Eagles fan... highly recommend it to all who are!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great book, well-written and great story line.  Best book I've read in the past six months!  I checked with an engineer friend ho confirmed the science was accurate.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|It was a great read and kept me inthralled from the first page. I will be reading more books by this author
1439130833|5.0|Everyday there's a uplifting message, to make you aware of who you are and your intentions. It changes your outlook on yourself, life and any situations that you may be going thru.. This Is A Must Have!!!
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I bought this DVD almost 2 weeks ago and it came out today in my mailbox. This concert is so amazingly well done...I love it. You can see how well they interact with the audience and with each other. They sang these songs perfectly. This is a must-have for Il Divo or any opera music fans.
B00ABKGG0C|2.0|I wanted to like this book. Like a lot of the other reviewers, I was impressed by so many 5-star reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the first few chapters because of the grammatical errors. There were so many, and it really distracted me from the story. So many misplaced commas, so many run-on sentences...it was really hard to read. What a disappointment.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|This was my first Garrett DVD I bought for my collection and I just love it. Is enjoyable for people of any age. I love the way he performs passionately his violin from beginning to end. Love all the tracks but love Hey Jude the most...was so awesome that everyone at the end started singing the chorus of Hey Jude. He knows how to rock the stage by just playing his violin. Well done Garrett!!!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|It is crude, nasty, bad taste, hilarious. Typical for Seth! There were a couple of comments by the bear that were NOT crude that made me roll on the floor, the funniest part of the movie. I guess I share McFarlane's sense of humor, including the goofy songs.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Great book! Loved the book! And I can't wait  to read the next books! I hope the series continues, without getting boring! :)
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I'm terrible at math.  Supremely terrible.  This alarm allows you to set anywhere from 1-10 math problems with selectable difficulty levels that must be solved in order to disable the alarm.  I am a very hard sleeper, and my whole life I have struggled to wake with an alarm.  My parents even resorted to dumping water on me in bed a few times because they tired of my alarm going of for hours before it penetrated my sleep-fogged mind.  This alarm is wonderful.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  The book was interesting.  It made you think about how fast  the world is moving to a one world government.  The U.N.'s Agenda 21,
B009186JYI|5.0|Unless you are a &#34;youngun&#34; who just started listening to the Stones, this is a Must-Have item, IMO. Kids today may well enjoy it.<br /><br />It's a really nice introspective to the Rolling Stones in their early rise to stardom. Mick and Keith are both in fantastic voice, Bill Wyman actually manages to crack a smile or two, and Charlie is, well, Charlie.<br /><br />I cracked this open and played it for my brothers on Xmas day. I first saw the band in '81, but they had the chance to see them from the late '60s on. We all enjoyed the trip back in time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  It left you hanging for quite a while.  Shame people really live in this psychotic relationship but they do.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is a very easy and quick read. It's wonderfully written and the main character has such a refreshingly simple and honest perspective on life.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|This book was outstanding! I love the detail and suspense through out the book and the surprises. I would recommend this book to anyone!

1594744769|5.0|This is literally the best book I've read this year. Seriously.<br />A young boy, Jacob, grows up hearing stories from his grandfather about the orphanage he grew up in surrounded by some very peculiar children. One is invisible, one has bees living in his stomach, one can levitate, and one can create fire in her hands. Sounds very much like the X-Men, no? But, these aren't super heroes, just regular children. And Grandpa might have been making it all up. Jacob travels to the island to find out for himself.<br />I seriously hope this is the beginning of a series, because this is such a deep mythology and there are many, many more stories to be told here. The writing is crisp and witty, prompting me to chuckle aloud on several occasions. Jacob's character is well drawn, and even secondary characters, such as Jacob's father become dimensional as well. But the best thing about it is the collection of photographs included, interspersed amongst the tale. These are actual found photographs, which the author claims to have doctored very little. They are eerie and haunting, and very lovely. I am so impressed with this author, and again, very much looking forward to more.
0385536828|5.0|Deception is at the core of Ian McEwan's novel, Sweet Tooth. McEwan sets the novel in England in the early 1970s, and uses a female protagonist and narrator, Serena Frome, to tell a slowly paced entertaining story about a new MI5 recruit and her relationship with the target of her initial assignment, a promising writer named Tom Healy. Serena's deception with Tom provides the plot action to engage readers in this story. As their relationship becomes intimate, the risks of the deception unraveling increased, adding a narrative tension that I found enjoyable. McEwan develops the complexity of both characters in ways that made me feel that I understood them quite well. Lovers of finely written prose will appreciate McEwan's skill in this novel. I especially enjoyed his use of Serena as a reader to provide context and insight into writers and writing as viewed from the perspective of a reader.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B002LFAHBO|5.0|We have a family night every Christmas season to watch this movie.  It will make you laugh out loud in some parts and weep in others.

B0050DZN4K|2.0|Worked fine for a few days. Now only says bind failure whenever I launch the app. Was great when it worked.
044024630X|1.0|Does Jack know how to say Hello?  Not really, but he doesn't need to, because he wears a uniform, sometimes, and he seems not to have met anyone he can't beat up or kill or, providing the gender is correct and the person is good looking, take to bed.  Conclusion:  Jack doesn't know Jack.  One Reacher novel in a year passes the time when the weather is bad.  Two are a reach.  Three might make decent kindling.  And I am no book burner.<br /><br />The passing nods to liberal issues in THE AFFAIR are ultimately inconsequential to the mayhem, which is the narrative's raison d'être, to spiffy this review up with a little Francaise .
B000QRIGLC|5.0|If you like reading military books and especially about US Navy Seals you will really like this novel.  It is inspiring and well as motivational.  Add it to your collection.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Insight Timer is a simple way to keep my daily meditation on track.  There is something motivating is seeing the consistancy of the practice in a simple chart.  Although it can be ego driven, it is also a clear way to see my committment in action.  I also like the feeling of community when I know others aroung the world are taking this journey with me at any moment of day or night.<br />Picking the tones, following friends urges me to keep practicing.  It is my most used app
B00493E1GI|5.0|Loved it! One of my favorites! Have seen it many many times and will see it many more times. LOVE!
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and did not notice any changes in aspect or screen size.  The movie was as I remembered it.<br /><br />I especially liked the extra material with background on the movie's design, the actors etc.<br /><br />A great buy of one of the classic black comedy films!
B000FC1HQY|1.0|I thought I found the racism in the book unsettling until I read some of the comments.  And that's when I was REALLy blown away.  I started this book but decided, after getting a few chapters in, that I would rather read a Black person's take on growing up in Africa, rather than read this woman's flippant and light-hearted description of her family's racist attitudes and behaviors.  As other reviewers pointed out, while the racism wasnt particularly surprising, her failure to address the \\"wrongness\\" of it was.  And reading so many comments suggesting that white rule was acceptable and almost necessary because African countries fell apart without it made me feel sick. Racism is alive and well in this world.  SO sad.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game was very addictive but upset that after the fist pack you are forced to buy more to continue to play
B0017O1MIM|4.0|I loved the quality of the blu-ray.  It was worth the extra cost.  The book was a nice coffee table type book.  I wish there had been more substance to the book and more interviews in the specials but I was very happy with what was there.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This, next in series, for the Ice Age clan was totally funny for all of us (grandmother to granddaughter) . Best seen with large bowls of popcorn. The characters become more themselves in this movie.  Very strong, totally delightful and very<br />witty. This is show for all ages.
0765325950|1.0|I was upset with Tor (the publisher) until I read Sanderson's blog saying how the decision not to have an e-book is the fault of Jordan's widow. She didn't want to risk the book not going to number one in hardcover because of people buying an e-book copy instead<br /><br />I don't know if her fears are justified, but I'm pretty sure that upsetting fans, insisting that their reading experiences be less comfortable and portable, and garnering a bunch of bad reviews as a result is probably worse for her husband's legacy than the risk of not hitting number one. I could almost understand if it was about the money, or if she had crazy prejudices about in which format people should be allowed to enjoy books (*cough* Jo Rowling *cough*), but this is just ill-informed vanity at its wonkiest.<br /><br />Personally, as much as I love hardcover books (to the point where our house may be sinking), it's just so much more pleasant for me to read an e-book. Not only can I take it everywhere, but my eyes appreciate the e-ink and my hands appreciate not fighting to prop a huge book open just-so when lying down. So, thanks Harriet.<br /><br />Poor Tor and Sanderson; they're going to be wrongly having to take the heat for this for a long time.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love the Indian Jones movies. I think they are all great movies and I was glad that they finally released these on Blu-ray. They are well worth the investment to upgrade your dvd's for sure. Go to blu-ray.com for a thorough review of the picture and sound quality of all of these movies.

B001Q9J4PG|4.0|I checked this out of my local library using Overdrive.  This was an enjoyable if somewhat overlong book written prior to 9/11/01.  It told of the need for a common NATO force to fight terrorism.  Good read.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is the easiest, most intuitive file manager that I have found for the Kindle Fire. Did I mention that it was free as well?
B0051T47NQ|5.0|This is such a cool movie!  A lot of tongue in cheek humor.  Very well done.  Those folks up in the far north really have their movie making chops down!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|i couldn't expect less from Nelson DeMille. John is so cocky it's easy to hate him and love him at the same time. This book will definitely keep you on your toes. Can't wait to read the next one.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Haven't read the Holmes stories in a long time.  Wonderful to re-read an old friend.  Especially delightful with all the new interest in Sherlock Holmes.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This program is a scam. It appears to be a a game for kids and is free. BUT they charge real money for \\"bags pf peanuts\\" to feed the animals. What child game has a $1.99, $9.99 and $99.00 option to buy peanuts with a tap of the screen!!!!!!!<br />REALLY AN OPTION FOR $99.00!!!!!!!!<br />This game has one purpose, to trick children into running up a bill on their parents account, hopefully unnoticed.<br />Shame on you Amazon for not removing this program.
0307279189|5.0|Very entertaining story.  Amazing that this race even took place.  Just goes to show that the crazy dreamers out there are often responsible for many of the great things in life.  The writer did an excellent job bringing the characters into this story and I love the way he described them.  Some of the reviews say that there should be pictures. Why?  Since you managed to get on this website I would imagine that you are capable of typing a name into Google.  Others complain that the author brought in views on the history of running and footwear.  I appreciated these insights, because I think they tie in with the story and made me look at running in a way that I usually don't.  We are inundated with advertisements telling us what we should be wearing and thinking to become better runners.  I find it refreshing to hear an author speak about getting back to the basics and running, because it's enjoyable!  I run, because I can and I believe that it makes me a better person.  Thanks for the reminder Mr. McDougall.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Because of its built-in printing option, this app is better than Quickoffice Pro and cheaper than OfficeSuite Professional 6. Printing is essential to any office app.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great performances by the actors-- one of the best programs on TV-- I can;t wait to see the next season
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved these books! The movie was okay but you miss so much! The books make you truely feel every emotion, every nail biting twist, every sadness...  I couldn't put them down! Plus, I hate paying for books on Kindle but I borrowed the first one & loved it so much... I had to buy all 3 of them! Best $17 I've spent on Kindle!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I liked all of the characters, the setting and most of the storyline. The ending seemed like a cop out.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci is one of my favorite authors and he does not disappoint me here.  Will Robie, another hero with a hidden past, joins Oliver Stone and his Camel Club, John Puller and Sean King/Michell Maxwell Maxwell with his own series.  You never get bored with his books and this is another you'll find hard to put down.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This game is both challenging and relaxing, with excellent graphics and music to boot.  The Kindle Fire version is like that for the PC, only its easier to manipulate the screen size and offers somewhat better game control (finger beats mouse-controlled cursor here).  The iPhone version is also good, but a smaller screen made precision game control difficult.  The Kindle Fire version reigns supreme.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This free app really works well. I especially like how the developer is taking care to update the app frequently. One note: I have had trouble updating the app through the Kindle Fire's automatic updater. I usually have to get the new update by using ES File Explorer. This is not a problem for me.
1449410243|3.0|The unpublished comics aren't funny enough to make me feel that the extra money was worth it. This is strictly from a laughter-inducing viewpoint; not an artistic one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this one the most... Perfect end to one of my favorite set of books! I couldn't put them down. I laughed, I cried... I couldn't help but get lost in the twists & turns of the book. A true love store... Not the fluff stuff. A story of love that shows the real ups & downs of love!
B00993FEUK|4.0|Great animation and a very good storyline.  While I didn't enjoy as much as some others I've seen, it was well done and entertaining.  I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I'm not a big social gamer but I have no way to add friends as an android user. My two friends who play both have iPhones but since I don't have game center they can't add me, and the only way I can add friends is through face book which is blocked as an abusive app. Otherwise I love the game, but let me add friends by user name or whatever. Words with friends can manage it....
0071422943|4.0|Perry's has improved since the 6th edition of the mid-80's. The eighth edition does what it is supposed to do: provide a broad coverage of our sprawling profession. I like it that it provides comparison tables for equipment allowing an engineer to identify which unit operation works best for a given material or operating conditions. Also, the superior graphics have returned. There has been some re-shuffling of sections and the number of pages have grown substantially to cover such new topics as security and inherently safe design in Process Safety and solids handling. These topics were ignored in previous editions. The economics section has been expunged from the eighth; this is sad since so many of my peers have forgotten the importance of this section to our profession.<br /><br />This version of Perry's has returned to my side shell. The 6th serves as a stop in my basement bookshelf. The 4th remains on the main shelf.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.

B006R1T40I|5.0|This is a beautiful CD, which is indicative of anything Bonnie Raitt puts out or sings.  She is our most favorite female singer, and she sure does bring the blues home, here in the Chicagoland area.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes the Blues.  She is totally AWESOME, as is her music.

B007KOLNXC|5.0|..... you will relate to this series in a very personal way...... I mean like it was yesterday!!  My wife & I started w/Season #1 just after Thanksgiving & just finished Season #5 last nite.  Thats 65 episodes in six (6) weeks -- and we RARELY watch any TV programs.  So for us, that says a lot -- we truly enjoyed this series watching it together (although I was ready to give it up after the first 2 episodes -- thought it was too slow.)  WOW, did that change fast or what!!??
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Beautiful love story,  that touches the heart. It has a catching and very touching story line. Just an all around great book.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. I want to read it again already.<br />It was funny,sad,real,happy, and was just plain amazing. The story was so unique. I've never read anything like it. I loved the detail Colleen put into it. It made the story real. Great job Colleen Hoover. A. M. A. Z. I. N. G.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|This was an intriguing book. The movements back and forth in time, force the reader to review some things in order to keep the timeline straight.  If you like books that make you do a little work, and I do, you'll be pleased with this one.  Kate is the star of the story and an interesting lady with what would seem like conflicting values given the job she had and her resolute sense of fairness. The FBI agents, Julia and Bill, are a tricky pair and we never really know who outsmarts who, but they are diabolically slick.  Kate and her husband, Dexter, both have brilliant minds but I did find it difficult to totally buy into believing that they kept huge secrets from each other for quite a bit of time.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This book kept me interested, but left a lot of things unexplained. Never guessed the ending,  and it is a heart breaking subject matter.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|If you enjoy great writing on historical topics, get this book. The way the main characters are slowly evolved so you understand little nuances of their personality, is wonderfully done.
B003MC5N28|4.0|A good book that makes you want to read more. This book had very little action, and a terrible ending.

1400082773|5.0|I nearly waited too long to do it, but I FINALLY read DREAMS OF MY FATHER by President Obama.  I have had the book for such a long time, but I don't usually read nonfiction, so like all the non fiction titles I intend to read (someday, I swear . . .) it took me over four years to get around to it!<br /><br />Some have call the book an unsentimental memoir.  I don't see that at all. I found it to be HIGHLY sentimental, and I thought it read like a novel.  I also found it very focused.  As a memoir, it is not about his favorite memories as a child, adult, or lawyer.  Or his favorite people.  Or his closest friends.  It is about searching and purpose.  And it is phenomenal how this man always seemed to be looking for purpose.  It is rather extraordinary and inspiring.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I could trust his memory.  I know he couldn't have remembered all of those important, life-changing, perspective-altering conversations word-for-word.  But the conversational tone made the work all the more approachable.  And I guess that is what strikes me the most about the book -- how much more approachable it made President Obama appear to me.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is at first a little hard to navigate but once I got used to how to play it was a lot of fun. My biggest problem with the game is that it's not easy to unlock characters
075669812X|5.0|My son is 8. He loves Lego Ninjago. He is into the characters, This book was great. It explained each character, their abilities, strengths etc. He has a hard time finding things to read. He read this book out loud everyday for two weeks. He refers to it alot and it even came with a one of a kind figure. You know that's a big deal. It was a great value and a really nice well made book. thick pages vibrant colors. Well worth the cost.

0470474874|1.0|We bought the Kindle Edition based on another review that said we could get the additional content that comes in a CD-ROM with the paper edition in digital form by asking Wiley Publishers for a download link. That is not true. I emailed them asking for it and never got an answer. This book would be infinitely more useful if we could consult and follow the examples to practice. I browsed the entire Wiley website and there is no reference to the CD-ROM content for Kindle Edition. Really, really disappointing.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|My daughter is a huge Michael Jackson, she has sat and watch his videos on YouTube. So this DVD was great for her, she has watched it so much that she has memorized the script and dance moves.  I'm really glad I could find the DVD and that it was shipped so quickly considering it was so close to Christmas.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Jointly reviewed on [...]    Jenny: Gitte, is it possible to fall in love with a book and its characters from the first few pages, because if it is then that is exactly what happened to me in Hopeless by Colleen Hoover. I fell in love with this book instantly and my feelings didn't waiver until I read \\"the end\\" and even then I've spent the past few weeks thinking about this book and how it affected me.    To say I have loved everything this author has written is an understatement. Every word she writes is flawless and every word demands to be read. This story took me completely by surprise. I didn't know what to expect and what I got was so much more than I could have ever hoped for. This story touched me, moved me, humoured me and devastated me and I loved every minute of it. Hopeless is a darker read than Slammed and Point of Retreat and I was absolutely enthralled with the places this author took me throughout this book.    Gitte: I am speechless Jenny, after I had finished this book I felt faint; every word this Author wrote squeezed my heart tight; made me dizzy and light headed....my eyes hurt as did my head; I just could not put it down! I am in complete awe and utter admiration....Reading Sky and Holder's story left me breathless, made me cry. This Author captures a reader in a tight hold carries you with words that each takes their rightful place in your heart and doesn't let you go until the story has been told. Long after, every single word still stays with you. This story just flowed so naturally. The relationship between the characters was inspiring their relationship and story intense.    \\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"    Jenny: I know how immersed you were in this story, you wouldn't even answer your phone until you finished it.  Sky is heading off to High School (and school in general) for the first time after being home schooled by her Mum for her school life. Unfortunately, she is forced to do this on her own as her best friend Six is moving away for six months and leaving Sky to face her first year of school alone.  Her introduction to school isn't a pleasant one with the other students already having a preconceived opinion of who Sky is - they couldn't be more off the mark where Sky is concerned, but Sky takes it all in her stride and she is lucky enough to make a friend in Breckin. This friendship is just so warm and funny! I just loved these two. They were kindred spirits and I absolutely cracked up at the banter between these two.  I have to say GG that I just ADORED Sky. She was strong, independent, yet vulnerable in some ways, funny and when her story starts to develop my heart just ached for her and the sorrow and sadness I felt for her was all encompassing.    Gitte: LOVED Sky; she was an amazing character. She is up front and doesn't suffer fools gladly. She is honest, genuine, funny, adorable, naïve yet knows more than a person should know. The somewhat sheltered life she has had, for reasons which become clear, has left her with this endearing quality an tangible innocence. Yet at the same time she had a spot on sense of humour and a sarcasm which yeah made me fall in love with her even more!    Jenny: Sky has never \\"felt\\" before. She has kissed a few boys, but she has not felt anything with them...nothing. That all changes when she meet Holder.  Dean Holder has a troubled past and a reputation and temper that precedes him.  Dean Holder......Wow! Be still my beating heart! I LOVED this guy! He stole my heart from the outset. There is an instant attraction between these two but it's not just an attraction - it's something deeper, something instant, a connection. They both feel it and the chemistry between these two was palpable. You absolutely felt their connection and you immediately needd to know why Holder especially is so drawn to Sky.  Sky is wary ofher feelings for Holder but she confides in him. In Holder she sees something, she begins to open up to him and express her feelings of \\"nothing\\" -.  Holder assures her that with him she will \\"feel\\" - \\"the moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you\\" - and how true this was! Not only did Sky feel that first kiss but I swear I did too GG!    Gitte: If anyone could make Sky feel again it had to be Holder. Seriously Jenny, what can I say about Holder. He was pretty damn perfect! I LOVE this guy. He was perfectly imperfect!! And yeah Jenny I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck and arms stand up because I felt it too!    Jenny: I felt exactly the same GG! To watch the relationship between Sky and Holder develop and flourish was something I devoured! These characters entered my heart....they nestled deep down in it and have found a place there forever.    The intimacy these two shared could be felt, with every word, with every touch and with every breath you feel it. This author really does have a way of bringing her characters to life and in this story they are brought to life so realistically that at times I actually found myself clutching my heart. You really do care what happens to these characters.    Gitte: This is where I have to bring the intensity up again. This Author just has this amazing talent that completely draws a reader in. Her words have a hard impact yet they soothe too; making each established word count in a way that it gets absorbed and doesn't leave, instead burrowing itself into the heart of the reader thereby creating a scene, an atmosphere, a picture, a feeling, a memory a smell even a perception or judgement.    The characters in this story...I loved them. Both of them. Their story... was beyond heartbreaking, amazing, touching, beautiful and emotional even funny at times. Hopeless iswithout doubt one of the best books I have read this year. What an amazingly talented Author Colleen Hoover is, Sky and Holder will always have a piece of my heart!    Jenny: Couldn't agree more GG. This is definitely going to be up there as one of my best reads for this year that's for sure! As each piece of the story was peeled away and their pasts revisited, my heart broke one piece at a time. It initially broke for Sky but in the end it shattered for both of them.    There were twists and turns all through this book and the reveal crushed me. The way it was handled amazed me. The ending satisfied me. It all felt so real, and I felt I was there with them in the moment for every moment. My interest, concern and love for these characters never wavered and I felt every emotion they felt.    There is the perfect blend of light and dark in this book so you don't feel weighed under with sadness but you do feel sad, you do feel the hopelessness and the hopefulness of Sky and Holder. Just as it becomes too much and you think you won't recover, the author injects humour and warmth and brings you back from the brink. It was perfectly crafted, wonderfully told and Hopeless forever has a special place in my heart.    J&G: This book is a departure from Slammed and Point of Retreat and we're so glad this author took the plunge and wrote this story. As readers we love and admire any author who can break the mould and produce a story that surprises us and gives us something different and that's exactly what happened with Hopeless. Don't' got into this thinking it's a carbon copy of her previous books. It isn't, and it is for this reason that this books so excited us.  Colleen Hoover is one storyteller who we feel could write just about anything and it would be captivating.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The story is pretty good. Even though this story seems like it's been done before, I can't help but give a thumbs up to the action. The part that annoys me about this book is the amateur style the author uses. Is the story in past tense or present tense? Is the author going for detail or is she just filling the chapters with filler words? In my opinion, this is a great book to read if you have nothing else to do. Basically, it's just a notch up from twilight garbage, and a peg below Harry potter.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|It started out way cute but got boring because it's slow to get anywhere. It's hard to make money and annoying how the cost of pets and houses goes up everytime you buy one. I hate games that make you use actual money in order to pass quests.
B002C2XXJY|5.0|this cd was very nice i like demi's music but if you are looking for younger kids there were no<br />bad words just nice music
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book in the world! Emotional. Happy. Sad. Sweet. Agonizing. Unrealistically true. It sort of describes the world we live in.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|We watched this to prepare our kids for a trip to Disney.  There are some parts that are a bit scary for young ones (giant ant, sparks falling) but nothing too intense.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Lots of fun, great graphics, super cute. Recommended for all. Ads a bit annoying but enough fun I just might get the full version.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I chose Yahoo because it is easy to use.  I like using it because there very little interruptions, and I do recommend it to new user.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|It started out cute but then it got boring. Takes forever to get money in this game and as you unlock land the price for other land unlocks goes up. I hats games that want you to use actual money to buy jewels to get quest items. Not sure they set this game up very well for kids.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|My grandson loves Legos and it's hard to find a new one for him but this is one he didn't have and he really liked it and  put it together quickly.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Descriptively paints the picture for an apocalyptic world.  I don't want to give away anything from the book, so I highly recommend to anyone interested in an end of days crisis or survival in general.  The story is far more about the protagonist, Robert Neville`s ability to survive on an emotional and mental level than that of a physical (food, supplies, etc.) one.  I related to the story because when I think about surviving in this type of situation many of the same ideas play into my head like that of the writer.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I ordered it because it was a headphone and not a neckphone. Just as advertised, it is light and very comfortable since I use it lying down, cannot use neckphone.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Horrible movie! What in the word??? Guess we expected to have a good time with Matthew but even tho the wife liked his body it doesn't stand up to the young guys...
B002RKSZN0|4.0|I have not read it yet.  I have seen the movie and will be reading it soon.  I did enyoy the movie.
B003S4G8RY|2.0|so my blu-ray players did not recognise it, and it's sucked.<br />I really love the movie, but now I need to find a way to convert the format to finally see all the special features plus the hd movie.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|cant wait for the next season to come out. one of the best tv shows ever made. i loved it
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app is very easy to use and I enjoy being able to search for whatever I want at the tsp of a finger
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This whole series has been great and the third season is holding up to expectations.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Edwardian history and/or British historical drama.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The signal dropped off 5 minutes before the movie finished so we didn't see the end....like what we saw. Great special effects.
B000JML7YC|4.0|I usually like Jane Austen books.  I liked the movie and usually read book that are connected to movies.  I would recommend if someone asked.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|Great album! Perfect to work out too! Marina and the diamonds remind me of Kimbra + September. I Loved it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!  What can I say that hasn't been said? I am a sucker for romance books!!! I love reading about Happily Ever Afters. I wasn't sure at first that this book was a romance book. It had me trying to figure out where the plot was going. I literally couldn't stop reading it. I laughed, I cried, I gave advice to Sky and I mourned Les. I've read alot of books on my Kindles, based on high reviews, and very few live up to their hype to me. This book did and for the money, this was a steal! I really expected another first person narrative Twilight rip off(i.e.Shades).  A must read for romance readers!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I like this because it gives me the options I like in a search engine. It makes my searches easier.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Yes this app is one fine app. I use it all the time when I need to go to Amazon...
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Ok movie...too much hype on advertising. The plot was ok but not that well done. If there is a part two we will pass.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|I am in the process of reading it now and I am enjoying it very much.  I have seen the movie version.
B0080YGZ20|5.0|This album is totally legit! I absolutely love it and i do not get bored of it. Kimbra is a great artist. Absolutely unique and fantastic.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|this game is very good if your your looking for a casual combat flight simulator that you  can pick up and play for 5 or 10 min without it being complex. and the graphics are decent. i hope the developer will continue to add to the game. the only draw back to the game i encountered was that i felt the games controls while adequate  could have be tighter even with the controls set to max sensitivity it still didn't feel as responsive as it should have have been.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|this app is ok.... I find it sort of slow to open what I want to view but nit used it much yet
0765325950|1.0|I asked my sister for the kindle version of this book for Christmas and a hardbook arrived in mail. When she said no kindle version existed, i thought she must be mistaken, but i see she is correct. I will be returning it unread.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Excellent balance of plot and variety of characters, witty and sharp dialogue - interesting interaction among the characters with glossy but not superficially slick production values.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|If UNORTHODOX JUKEBOX is half as great as DOO-WOPS & HOOLIGANS then Bruno will have another HUGE HIT!  DOO-WOPS & HOOLIGANS is my absolute go to music.  I first gave a review in January 2013.  Late March 2013, I'm OK with U.J. but Doo-Wops & Hooligans is by far THE BEST.  I prefer Bruno when he's more brooding. Wish him all the happiness in the world but his songs just aren't as good on the second album with the exception of Locked out of Heaven.  Just one person's opinion but I would definitely give a third album a chance.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Wasn't sure I would like a stop action movie about small animals, but I found it very enjoyable.  Once I started watching it I couldn't stop until the end.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Quite a gripping read. My only complaint is that Townshend doesn't tie the experiences in his personal life to the music he created as a result. Sometimes it's mentioned, but only as an afterthought.
0451232852|4.0|Good story and am looking forward to sequel. It does get a little long toward the end with politics of post war Europe and Russia, but otherwise a good story.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|One of the best series on television. Excellent acting and a true evocation of this era in U.S. history and the evolution of advertising as a force in American culture.
B004X80QNG|5.0|This has become my most used app. Simple to figure out, and has so many great features to help keep life organized. I love the fact you can setup categories and color code everything....so at just a glance you can know your whole schedule, not just for you but every member of your whole family, and what tasks need to be done. For me it is great that the calendar and task are two separate tabs and I can set up tasks without having to put them on the calender though I still have the option to put a date under the task and it is shown when I look at tasks.Just a great app....well worth the money!<br /><br />Update, I use this app on the Kindle Fire and have not had an issue with the app. Been using it for 3 months consistently and not once has it crashed on me or stopped responding. I check, use, update this calender several times a day. Still my most used and favorite app
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing how one can get away with so much...I am sure these types of stories come through the court systems everyday.  Sadly the guilty walk away.  Great story, interesting perspective s from both sides
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Having just completed Team of Rivals two-minutes ago, I felt compelled to submit this review. Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'Team of Rivals' was shaped so thoughtfully, now that I have consumed the final word, I feel as if I have lost an old friend. An old friend I've been spending rainy afternoons with, sneaking an hour here and there, and spending my nights with when the clock hit 1am and I couldn't bring myself to close the pages. Kearns Goodwin takes a challenging pathway, leading us quietly through the personalities and life struggles of the men whom Lincoln would come to surround himself with. At times, her words transformed me into that 'fly' on the wall, and instantly I was back in 1860 watching history unfold. Her decision to show the reader the behaviors and convictions that drove the cabinet members, made this recount of Lincoln's life such a personal and touching one. She shows you just how 'great' this man was, with honest accounts of confrontation diffused with respect and understanding, and constant acknowledgment of his responsibilities as the Chief in Command, to remember that we are all people...first, with certain rights. You understand how big he had become by how his rivals would come to respect him, embrace him and trust him during those trying years. A man bigger than any of recent memory. At times I felt the author was providing me too much information on ancillary topics, but now that I am at the end of her words, I understand her approach. For I am left with tears rolling down my cheeks, and feeling a loss of a President as if it happened yesterday. And this holds true, despite even knowing how it would end! Thank you Doris Kearns Goodwin for your dedication and beautiful words. Through your lens, I am left with the feeling that I have uncovered something very special in getting to know and spend time with Abraham Lincoln.
0330511661|5.0|Jeffrey Archer never fails to entertain me. He even educates me at the same time. I read this book some time ago, but I recently acquired several additional copies for my book club and read it again with them. Good choice for a mixed gender book club.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the 1st book I got to read on my new kindle (thank u hubby) This is an amazing love story with so many twists & turns! I was completely glued to this page turner & I can't stop raving & recommending it to EVERYONE! Thanks Colleen for a great read!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Knowing what Paul Simon and Ladysmith Black Mambozo went through to product this album adds to its mystique. The bridges built with this album are impressive and the music itself is simply superb.
B0063IH60K|5.0|no problems downloading getting game or playing game....perfect...love it...can't get enough...play play and play..when I stop it will save right where I ended....going to go play now...
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|This is the only TV series we own and will watch again.  Love the intensity, the complex story telling and characters.  We have the entire show.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Pros:<br />- The price<br />- Great performance for all but the most CPU intensive tasks (video encoding, very large file compression, etc...)<br />- Max power dissipation of 55W leaves it running cool all day and all night<br />- Supports virtualization (VT-x), hyperthreading, and Intel Speedstep<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The graphics aren't all that<br />- No overclocking<br /><br />First, let me say that for a budget processer, the i3-3220 is, in my opinion, as good as it gets. I purchased it for a gaming and photoediting rig that I built recently and it has been performing splendidly. Hyperthreading allows two cores to act as four, increasing performance even further. The Intel Speedstep technology lets the clock rate dynamically adjust to the load being put on it and by doing so saves power and keeps your fan(s) quieter. My temperature typically idles around 30 degrees celsius, which is terrific, and will get no higher than 38 degrees celsius under load. I use the Rocketfish Universal CPU Cooler, linked to in my build info at the end. The virtualization technology can be helpful in a lot of situations, the most important to most users probably being that this allows you to run Mac OS X inside of a VM in Windows.<br /><br />As for the graphics, they will work fine for anyone not playing games or viewing very high quality movies. That being said, anyone who will be playing games or watching high quality movies/film should invest in a graphics card, even if it is cheap it will likely outperform integrated graphics. This chip uses Intel HD 2500.<br /><br />And the fact that this does not support overclocking is to be expected and absolutely no reason to deduct a star. Of course I wish it did support overclocking because I believe it would have a lot of headroom but it is in the lowest series of current desktop processors for Intel so if you are looking for overclocking get the i5-3570K, that thing can overclock!<br /><br />All-in-all, this processor should be the go-to for anyone looking to build a budget PC. It can run anything I throw at it and handles internet browsing, emails, gaming, Photoshop, etc... with a breeze.<br /><br />My build:<br />Computer Case - Rosewill Challenger Black Gaming<br />Power Supply - Raidmax Hybrid 2 RX-530SS 530W<br />Motherboard - Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H<br />RAM - Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB)<br />CPU - Intel Core i3-3220 3.3GHz<br />CPU Cooler - Rocketfish Universal CPU Cooler<br />Thermail Paste - Arctic 5 Silver<br />Hard drive - Hitachi Desk Star 500GB<br />Graphics - EVGA Nvidia GTX 460<br /><br />I would highly recommend any or all of these products for a budget PC build.<br />Currently triple booting Windows 7, Mac OS X Mountain Lion, and Backtrack Linux.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Amazon sells both the CPU cooler and thermal paste, and you can bundle them for even more savings!<br />http://www.amazon.com/Rocketfish-RF-UPCUWR-Universal-CPU-Cooler/dp/B0030U9ET0<br />http://www.amazon.com/Arctic-Silver-Polysynthetic-Thermal-Compound/dp/B0002VFXFE/ref=pd_sim_pc_1
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Good in depth discussion of the actual raid.Not just your typical Seal training recount. Must read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very interesting and captivating series. After watching doomsday preppers, I think the idea in this book is very real. Who can say there aren't plans, discussed in this book, being developed by some countries out there.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Sad but good and even a little frustrating at times but a lovely written story that is a page turner.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm hooked on the game!  I've played it every night since I got it! It's very easy to play & fun!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I really enjoyed how the writer/director only took the concept, but made it their own movie.  Colin Farrell was amazing.  Total Recall was a total breath taker.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Thanks for  inviting me into this wonderful world.. read it. So vivid, each separate world reads . I want to hear FRobisher play.p
B0092C2X7U|1.0|I thought this was horrible.  Apparently, the promo made it sound much better than it was for me to even consider it!  I actually deleted it from my Kindle!  That's my opinion!!!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|i put this motion sensor on a dark stairway so at night time i don not trip walking down the stairs with the baby. It senses me when im about 8 feet away!! that perfect so light goes on BEFORE i take my first step. LOVE THESE SENSORS AND PLAN TO BUY SOME FOR MY CLOSETS.
B009G56RN4|4.0|Hesitated between 4 and 5 stars.  5 because it is exhilaratingly original, and superbly made (acting, photography and score in particular). 4 because the story went off the rails a bit toward the end.  Either way, there are so few working filmmakers anywhere near this this level of confidence, bravery, mastery and originality, that the film, like all of PTA's, should not be missed.
B001ENS0BI|5.0|So incredibly sad, but what a great way to end everything. Such a great show, well worth watching over & over again. This is my favorite season apart from season one.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Terrific concept: just what a cloud player should be!  Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer.  Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid. One Wish: categories by genre: classical, pop, country etc are all mixed together so there's a bit of wading thru just to remember what's on there.
0859537978|2.0|This one is a cute little story, but the larger hardback is much nicer with interactive pieces to it that is much more intriguing to a young child.  Spend a little more to get the hardback.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|I don't think anyone would have previously associated the word arty with the Waschowskis but that indeed is what they've made with their good friend, German director Tom Twyker.  Some would consider Twyker arty but indeed all three make the leap here.<br /><br />The best way I can summarize this film is by saying it is NOT linear.  It does not unfold along the usual lines.  All sorts of experiments are ongoing throughout about telling a story out of sequence and by flashing to different characters in different times from way back in the past to way forward in the future.  The characters are involved in reincarnation to an extent but that is only one small part of this film.<br /><br />It took me about half an hour to get used to the constantly shifting action of the film but after that I really liked it and thought that it moved the story along very well. There is a lot of action adventure in the film so if you are expecting a slow pace because it is arty, it is NOT SLOW.<br /><br />What is the film about?  I'd say it is philosophical and embraces life, death, families, continuation of lives in other guises and above all creation in every form.<br /><br />There is so much going on that I really feel as if I need to see this several more times.  I am sure I will see so much more with every viewing.  That is the mark of true excellence.<br /><br />I am sure there are going to be people who hate this film.  If you hate arty films or foreign films, I think you may be one of them.
0790733226|5.0|I love this movie !<br />I love Jodie Foster, think she's a great actress !<br />This is another one of those movies that get you thinking !<br />I had to get it on DVD, no longer have a VHS player...
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|Very slow, repetitive and boring. Lack wit. Why do you push people to keep writing more? Few and conscise words suffice.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|The first CD I was not excited about, but CD number 2 is non-stop awesomeness!  I loved it it  it
1849839727|5.0|I have been purchasing numerous books for my son who is away from home and has plenty of time to read.  This is one of his favorites.
0765325950|1.0|I can't believe that the ebook version was not released at the same time as the hardcover! That is ridiculous, stupid, and incredibly short-sighted. Guess what, you've lost my money and I won't help make it a bestseller. I will just find it at my library. The wait list is much shorter there than for the ebook release!
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|note: Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar shortly after I wrote this review.<br /><br />Helen Mirren utterly engaged me as Alma Hitchcock, pretty much the unsung heroine behind the camera in all of his movies. Today she would be credited as a writer on the movie, at the very least. But Alma was content with her life.  She did exactly as she pleased and was an admired and talented woman.  Only the insiders knew about her but they valued her.  Mirren convinced me she was this character.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins successfully recreates Hitchcock.  He both looks and sounds like him.  But there aren't any big surprises with his role. He is pretty much everything you already knew about Hitchcock. However, he does it very well but the movie wouldn't have been very interesting had it been just he playing Hitchcock.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humor in the movie too but it is that low key British humor so you have to be attuned to it.  For example, when the screenwriter interviews with Hitch, he is late as he just left his daily appointment with his shrink.  Hitch doesn't think much of this info UNTIL the young man mentions the things he is talking about in it, especially about his mother. Hitch hires him on the spot and the next thing we know, he is seeing the shrink too! (The mother, Mrs. Bates, is key to the film PSYCHO, which is when the movie is set.) Hitch also interviews Anthony Perkins for the role of Norman Bates and that has its humorous moments as well. He tells Hitch he'd like to do PSYCHO as he doesn't want to get typed by the romantic parts he currently is playing for the studio. (The joke here is that after PSYCHO no one could ever see Perkins again as anyone but Norman Bates.) As they talk about Perkins' inner psyche, it turns out he too has a lot of issues about his mother.  After this talk, Hitch correctly guesses Perkins is bisexual or gay (this was true. Although married and with children, Perkins also was attracted to men and contracted HIV-AIDS and died of it at the height of the AIDS crisis). Norman Bates is supposed to be gay even though that is never said straight out in the film.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannssen and Jessica Biel nail Janet Leigh and Vera Miles respectively.  Everyone looks remarkably like their real life counterparts.<br /><br />If this were not a year awash in fabulous films, I might think this would do well on the awards circuit.  Mirren may even so. However I can't see this film winning up against the field of competition it is facing.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B002JWD6AS|5.0|Great book, great series! I could not put this book down. It was the first &#34;werewolf&#34; series I ever read and I wish there were more books. I highly recommend!
B004CURZFC|5.0|Not just for little kids, even parents will appreciate the artwork and very true to life depiction of these majestic birds. The story is interesting and the voice characterizations are well done also. Overall a very good CGI effort!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|An amazing calculator for kindle fire. Large screen numbers are perfect for crunching stats and sums. One of the best free apps for KindleFire.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Finally got the headphones that so many budget audiophilia were raving about. And honestly, the second I put them on I could see why. These are definitely the best pair of headphones I have ever owned. Granted, these are the most expensive that I've purchased and don't have an pro-range headphones to compare them to. However... many who do own other $300+ headphones claim that these are some of the best they've ever owned, and even prefer them over their more expensive pairs.<br />They're comfortable, look great, sound amazing, and seem very durable. The cord is definitely thicker than any other pair of headphones I've had, which is good because it seems like cords are always the first to break on headphones. It's also pretty neat that it's of like a scrunchy cord, and I can walk about 8 feet away from my mixer to pick up a guitar and it stays firmly on my head.<br />Listening to regular ear buds and other headphones just isn't enough once you try these. I can't stand listening to or recording music with my ear buds anymore knowing I'll be missing out on my MDR-7506's. Seriously, get em. Their flat out response will blow you away, without blowing away your money.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Beyond the fact that the actors in this movie are not only attractive, but give a great performance at the core of this movie is a true love story many of us hope and wish to have for ourselves.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I had a difficult time understanding it at first but once I got the language, I enjoyed the DVDs.  The packaging is great and this makes a great gift.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is amazing on my kindle fire i absolutely love this game. i strongly suggest this game to everyone that enjoys any of the ice age movies.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|While I found the book enjoyable and honest I also found many parts to be confusing and hard to follow. I would not let that deter you from the book that also was honest and enduring.
0385344333|4.0|I was given \\"A Wanted Man\\" by Lee Child for Christmas and quickly worked it into my reading as I've been a fan of the Jack Reacher series for quite some time.  I enjoyed the read, but it wasn't my favorite of the books for sure.<br /><br />This one didn't quite have what many of the others do, and I can't really place just what that \\"it\\" is.  While there were a couple of surprises, there were also some predictable elements, and while guessing what was going to happen didn't ruin the story for me, it might for others.  For a quick, easy, action tale, this was a fun light read.<br /><br />I'm still a Jack Reacher and Lee Child fan, and I'll look forward to finding out what happens when Reacher makes it to VA.  However, you might think after this he would think a little harder about hitchhiking.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, author of \\"Lost Conscience: A Ben Baker Sniper Novel.\\"
B007EECSFA|5.0|The story kept me turning the pages and had surprises that I did not anticipate.  I really enjoyed the characters and loved the conclusion of the story.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This is the third novel I've read my Ian McEwan,and I once again not disappointed. I always thoroughly enjoy a book that acknowledges itself as a story and Sweet Tooth has plenty of that type of writing.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher. Cruise makes this character his. Cruise's Reacher is a thinking mans' too the point blunt instrument and he gets the job done his way and for his motives. It is a very subtle film and that is part of the brilliance here. I went in with low expectations, but I was blown away by JACK REACHER. What a multilayered film of action, drama and suspense. Tom Cruise just keeps getting better with age.<br /><br />I was totally engrossed by this film. The editing by Kevin Stitt was tight and very effective and Christopher McQuarrie's script with his low key direction gave this a great, yet very subtle narrative sweep. Joe Kraemer's score was old school and it really works here. Robert Duvall continues to demonstrate his brilliance as an actor and almost steals all his scenes, not quite, Duvall enhances them like no other.<br /><br />This film has it all. This film delivers! Don't let this one get away!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Not a bad movie if you are bored but not a classic you will watch over and over again. Watch at your own risk.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love the game! rovio does really good with their games and updates this is a highly addictive puzzle game that I love!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My daughter who is 9, loves this app. She has so many fun options to be creative. Being able to save her artwork and email them to her grandparents and friends is an added bonus.
1905236042|5.0|I got this for the kids but soon found that the adults have just as much fun. Great for 2 years and up. Still laughing and playing. Great way to use relax and still play with the little ones.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game. There are so many different locations and the colors are great. I can't keep my 3 yr old grandson off of it though.
B005LAII8A|5.0|This sci-fi action film is outstanding! Bruce Willis nails it! The plot is very engrossing and imaginative, but it is Bruce Willis' performance that makes this film work. This film was a magnificent surprise! It blew me away! The edge of your seat action and suspense were just too incredible for words! This is another must-see film!
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Excellent Movie! I would recommend this to anyone! The actors and the entire series are wonderful and follow along the movie quite well!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|The cream of the cream. All the beatles LP's in a great box and the songs  are remastered with the vinyl sound. Incredible. And, of course, the book is excellent. Congratulations EMI and APPLE for this records.

0307730697|5.0|Wow, this is one heck of a book.  I literally could not put it down.  It is a nice change to get a G rated biography on a service person!  I read these types of books all the time, and Blehm told the amazing story of Adam Brown without profanity!  I think I remember 2 minor bad words.<br />This book is about a man who struggled with life and drugs, and turned his life over to Christ.  I am so impressed with this book I am planning on getting another copy or two to donate to our Christian school.<br /><br />GET THIS BOOK!  IT IS A MUST READ!!!!!!!!
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I  thought this was going to be one an outstanding must see film! I was wrong. It is a riveting experience. It is emotionally charge that really engages the heart and mind. It makes you happy, it angers you, it makes you want to go up to the highest mountain and just shout out Denzel Washington is truly one of the best actors of our time. I can not say enough or properly communicate the credit that this film so deserves. This is a rare film going experience. A film of this caliber is a rare thing. Sit back pour yourself a drink and savor that experience. Unfortunately, the experience is not all that welcome. Denzel is great, but his character is flawed beyond the sympathy that the director sought from the viewer.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This item came 2 days earlier than the expected arrival date. Also, it came in a nice metal case (which I wasn't expecting). The new Batman trilogy is such a good set of movies.
0765325950|1.0|The artificially delayed ebook release is unacceptable.  Paper printing is and should be dead.  There is no legitimate reason to force the giant brick of a paper edition on anyone anymore.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book. Quick and easy book to read. I did not realize I had to do a book report because I borrowed a book.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was eager to read of Dr.Alexander's experience of heaven especially since I live in the Charlottesville area near UVA. However, his experience did not seem to line up with a Biblical prospective as do the many other persons who have passed over and returned.  He seem to go back and forth from evil (hell?) to heaven.  No scripture referencing at all.<br />When I finished the book I felt a heaviness and no excitement of going where he went.  I will stick with those who see heaven or hell, God the Father, and Jesus.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|There were a lot of pieces, but it didn't take long for 2 boys to build.  I did think the wall would be larger - it looked almost miniscule when finished.
B0067R0APK|4.0|good on time info. good maps. I like the lay out of the pages and the map pages. good info on current area maps.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|Never downloaded any of my emails.  Don't know what else to say but it didn't work.  So I uninstalled it.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Well, I'm a HUGE fan and this CD did not disappoint in ANY way...her voice is stunning, her lyrics are moving and deep and I'm glad she came back to what we all kinda love about her. If I ever had the chance to sit down with her and pick her brain, she would be my #1 choice. I adore her, I admire her courage and story and honestly this has been the ONLY CD I've purchased in a very long time. That is how die hard of a fan I am...I actually wanted the tangible CD to hold in my hands while I was taken away in every song. &#60;3
0937381888|5.0|After you brew a few batches, you will realize that this is largely necessary, as all of this information can be found online at this point.  But for me it was a necessary confidence booster for and found it convenient to have all of the basic information one needs for home-brewing consolidated in one locations in a readable manner.  This is very well written, geared towards the novice.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|THE ITALIAN JOB<br />I love the Italian Job, the story was great as were the actors, I would watch it over and over again.<br />Sonia Maulsby
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Like many others, I probably read this in high school, but I remember very little. With its new popularity and the probability that I will be going to see the movie version, I felt it was important to read the original.<br /><br />The language is amazing, the translation likewise.  The most dismaying thing is that though times have changed, they haven't changed very much.  People still suffer far too much from poverty and the cruelty of their supposedly fellow humans.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use several &#34;tests&#34; to help me judge the value of a dictionary; this one passed. I recommend it for mobile devices.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|You have to watch it really close to keep up with everything and I really just did not like it very well
B009YU62H2|5.0|First studio album in how many years?... I guess after doing a search on Soundgarden, they have been playing the last couple of years so it isn't like they have been on hiatus. They still rock alternatively, lol. Jam on !!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I first saw this show when I was in High School, back in the early 1990s..and I fell in love with the show and especially the music.  I have seen it over the years several more times since then, and when I saw this DVD was put out, I decided to get it.  WOW is all I can say.  It's put together very nicely and the entire company, especially Ramin and Sierra, are really phenomenal.  This is a DVD that is worth getting, especially for Phantom lovers.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I loved the movie taking place in a possibly not so-distant future, dreary future, as opposed to the comic book's distant future that bears no resemblance to our own world.  Furthermore, the vague mention of the nuclear wasteland mutants left a lot more horror potential than the blatant exposure posed by the comic books.  It was a real gamble to diverge significantly from the comic books, and it worked.  Now I will have trouble enjoying the Judge Dredd comic books.
0872860175|5.0|great! nothing less but great this is truly a classic, that everybody should read at least once in their lives.

B0039UTDFG|5.0|Came before Christmas. Brand new shiny container. The intended recipient watches it everyday. It is just like watching the program save for the commercials.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The second movie was the best of the three, but this finally raps everything up nicely. I would defiantly recommend this film.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|The packaging and the case was excellent.  The disc itself was bootleg.  Now the picture did not show bootleg though.  It was a very interesting movie.  My husband enjoyed it

B007TNS6JI|5.0|Good graphics and a good hack and slash game lots of levels a nice selection of weapons and armor also powers<br />GEt
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was bought as a Christmas gift for my 4yr old.  My older kids really like this movie.  They walk around singing the songs.  So according to my 11 & 12 yr old,  the movie was excellent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|. . . But cards don't need to zip to the suit pile or another column when I click on them.  I'd like a choice.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Good movie it will make you lol cry to<br />best movie I seen in a long time and it will make you stop<br />and think about life
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is addicting.  I absolutely love it. My friends are now downloading it too. It works great on my Kindle fire.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The humor is admittedly kind of juvenile, while at the same time being completely inappropriate for kids.  A really good time!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book was absolutely delightful. I laughed and cried. And it made me see my own 4-legged companion in a different light.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love the fact that it syncs between laptop, tablet and phone.  Only thing missing would be the option to add reminders.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Why does this keep coming up when I click on another app?  If I want to play it, I will.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Was . A cute and exciting novel. Sparks Has Won me  over. A plus.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I had high expectations after reading other customers reviews but this book appeared even better. Highly recommended! Definitely 5 stars!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|...but I just didn't like it.  Like reading outtakes from the Warren Commission or the 9/11 Report, the insight into how  a disaster happened after the fact just doesn't satisfy my need for &#34;problem, suspense, crescendo, solution&#34; reading entertainment.  This may be one of those rare ones where the movie will be better.
0563214546|4.0|I like the recipes in this book, there are recipes that are rarely seen or eaten here in America any more. Her directions are a little wordy and not broken down the way modern cookbooks are but I'm sure I'll find this tome useful. I actually purchased this because I wanted recipes for proper British Sunday supper roasts and Christmas dinners. The book even includes a useful chapter on picnicking.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you have seen the movie this book is great because it adds some good detail to the story line.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Wish there were statistics and other simple features.  Every game ends in a &#34;win&#34; and only the time it takes to solve a game is measured.
B0015DROBO|4.0|A friend loaned us a copy--we enjoyed it enough to get  it for ourselves when it was featured in an Amazon mail.<br />There is so much going on that it is worth having your copy to enjoy again.  It  was hard to put down!  The author weaves a story that needs to be read a little more carefully or you lose an important clue.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book from a recommendation and read it before reading the info. It was amazing!!!!!!!!! There are no words. I read this book in one day, well two technically if you add in I was up until after 3am. So great!
B000JMLFLW|3.0|A classic novel of youth. Brings back memories of required reading in high school. A must read for any one.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a very good  learning tool for all. Very pleased to have purchased this item and I have no regrets. I would recommend this to anyone.
1843106698|5.0|This book is not for the faint of heart. It starts with aspergers as a small child and works its way through each age range, all the way through adult hood. It includes being elderiy and having aspergers. It also has a dishearening section on long term relationships, romantically speacking, on being with an aspie. I have an aspie husband of 8 years now. He has taken some time to come to teams that this is his struggle. He has taken an even longer time coming to terms how I live with him, why I stay, and how it will work in the future. I will say this about the book: the author is the first to get through to my husband in a way he completely understood and made my husband feel like he could accept it as real, as true, as authentic, and as who he is as a person. This alone has changed our marrigae dramatically to say the least. I have not read the book myself, as the parts I did I found dry, hard to wade through and written from a very clinical point of view, perfect for an aspie not an NT. I am grateful eternally for the boo. Within the first 6 weeks of him reading it, my husband and I communicated more authentically and seriously and comically thenin the prior 8 years put together. It has led to many, many sleepless nights up taling about what he is learning, what it means, what it can do for us, how we see it fitting, what we can do as a couple to make adjustments and change and help. My husband has gone to work sleep depriced from talking so much...funny for us! I reccomend this book for everyone who thinks they may have aspergers themselves or their families or friends. Its the best thing outside of finding eachother that has happened to us. I ordered a copy for his mom also and she is reading it as i write this which has been seriously helpful in the respect that she can confirm things from when he was little, an adolesent, and a teenager. She is relieved to finally know why he has little to no communication with any of this parents, siblings, or other family orfriends. She is excited to learn how to communicate in a way that will finally bring her close to her son. I am so glad to have found this book. It saved my marriage, seriously. ANd we were already both very committed. Im also learning how to communicate in ways that work for both of us...A MUST READ!!!
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Kubrick's take on Stephen King's masterpiece is almost humorous, as Nicholson's over-the-top performance gives a truly terrifying situation comedic twists and turns. That being said, I have never felt more of a sense of isolation and despair in a place that is truly malevolent. The lighting and hollow sounds of Danny's big wheel builds dramatic tension, until the climatic scenes in which Jack Torrance truly unravels....the hotel itself gives a sense of dread from the opening shot on, much like the log cabin in the original Evil Dead, or Norman Bates house in the original Psycho.
B008602KQI|4.0|At first I had no desire to see this movie because the concept of kids killing kids bothered me.  I watched the movie, then all the behind the scenes extras and perhaps I desensitized myself to the concept.  I came away being able to see the movie as a very well done movie, liked the characters and especially the attraction between the main characters.  The director, Gary Ross, was a perfectionist in all he did and the results of that is a movie that most people should be able to appreciate and understand for what it is.  It is not condoning kids killing kids but rather quite the opposite.
1451627297|5.0|It's a King, what more is there to say? You just cannot go wrong buying his books. I have ALL of them!
0385536828|5.0|Some reviewers  didn't like Serena, after reading the book, but  she sure seemed like a fun person to me.  From the first, I liked the way she fought back on her Mom's insistence that she study maths at Cambridge, and found a way to do her reading of fiction through her four years there.  Her summer long affair with an older professor didn't seem like the best judgment, on her part, but she lived through it and survived it's unhappy ending.  Details about her work with M5 and the idiocy of the bureaucracy there made good reading, too.  I couldn't quite understand why it was verboten to reveal who she worked for to her new lover, Tom, but could accept that.  All of which is to say that the ending made it all worth while.  No spoiler here, but anyone who reads a good portion of the book and abandons it misses one of the best (cleverest?) endings of a book I've run into.  Persevere, readers, persevere.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|The only thing that could make this soundtrack better would be if they had Fade into You on it. Other than that it's my new favorite thing to listen to!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Really enjoy this movie. It a movie when you need a good laugh this is the one. I would refer this to anyone.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I have read that Kubrick started working on this project well before &#34;Platoon&#34;, as a master craftsman he took years to get where he wanted before filming began. This film, unlike the other films about Vietnam starts with recruits in Parris Island, being molded into the perfect Marines. I found this film spartan and cold (that can be said of any Kubrick film, except Spartacus), and yet darkly humorous, (particularly R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor whipping the recruits into fighting shape.)  Kubrick to me brought more of a detached view to war than any other director out there. (See &#34;Paths of Glory&#34; an indictment of French leadership in the 1st World War)<br /><br />The transfer was excellent, the sound and picture as I remember seeing them on the big screen. 5 Stars.

0142419400|3.0|I bought the kindle version of the book and listened to the audiobook while reading it. So yes, I became totally immersed into the main girl's character since this is set in her point of view and the audiobook is read through her point of view so it seems as though she was talking to me when I was listening to it. And same goes for every character in the book since the voices change as the dialogues go. I liked that, actually. The main lad is London-raised and when read through the audiobook he does have an accent. So I guess I did like the audio book.<br /><br />Basically about this typical American girl named Anna who seems very average and nothing special. Actually, throughout the whole book, that's all she was: average. By average, I mean typical heroine in a contemporary novel. She's not even the that funny and perhaps everyone who reviewed this book on Amazon has just exaggerated her sense of humor. That or maybe I just read contemporary fiction novels that are much funnier.<br /><br />She was tolerable (likable, even) the first half of the book but then she fell in love and she became extremely self-absorbed. She became extremely obsessed with main guy, Etienne St. Clair, whom she's called beautiful at least hundreds of times in the book. It was annoying and her attitude when she's realized that she was in love with St. Clair was just painful to read.<br /><br />So this was how it went down for me when it came to Anna's character development: tolerable, getting less tolerable, not tolerable, annoying, and then almost tolerable.<br /><br />There are things that I liked though. Like the main guy's physical imperfections -- not perfect-looking, unlike about every guy in the romance novels that I read recently. Unlike the norm, St. Clair is short (even shorter than the main girl) -- and had crooked bottom teeth. It's more believable that way. He also was a bit immature and didn't always do the right thing. You know, how privilege 18-year old guys would normally act. But yes, indeed, he was charming for the most part!<br /><br />I also liked the settings of the book. It was set in Paris and it's almost always perfect setting for falling in love. The places were well-described and how it's like to be a foreigner in a foreign land. The difficulties she'd had to go through when lived there because of the language barrier. I went through the same thing went I spent two months in Japan.<br /><br />All in all, I give this book three stars. It's not perfect but hey, I've read much worse.<br /><br />A book something similar to this is the 2nd novel in the book A Year in Europe by Rachel Hawthorne. And maybe I should have watched Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris before reading just so I have the right feel of the place since I haven't been to Paris.
B001IF252M|5.0|This is a great adapter for your Apple product! Easy Easy Easy set up, just plug it in and go! My applications run smoothly across screens, no flickering screens no cut outs just...great! One thing I will warn you about, People are complaining it doesn't work with there iMac or MacBook but thats because they don't have the proper Graphics card installed in there computer to support it! Make sure you have a correct graphics card! Once again this is a great product and Iv'e never had any problems with it.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|this game is very fun. it is very simple but a good time passer. i really enjoyed it. download it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I have now read this lovely book three times, it always makes me smile. I fell in love with story as a child on the 90s watching the BBC version of the book with my mother.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It seems to meet my needs. I like the fact I can travel with it as I'm a full time traveler.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|We marathoned season 1 - bought the entire season and parked ourselves on the sofa.  I read Vince Flynn and Brad Thor, so this is right in my wheelhouse.  Can't wait for Showtime to run the season 2 re-runs.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Real good movie, full of action!! Being a native of Philly and seeing some landmarks I know made this more pleasureable. I have it in my collection, it's also on Netflix and in Redbox, LOVE IT...LOVE IT. Alson a big Danny Glover fan, to whom I met in a hotel during his Lethal Weapon days.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I WAS NOT SURE IF TO GET THIS COVER OR NOT BUT I NEEDED A COVER & I LIKE IT, IT WORKS FOR ME & THE STAND SO IT COULD STAND UP IT ALSO WORKS PERFECT I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS I MIGHT EVEN BUY ANOTHER ONE WITH DESIGNS....I HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like the game. It holds your attention and is entertaining. Graphics are really good, and if you like animals, it's probably a game you will enjoy.  I spent probably 2 hours playing with it after I downloaded it on my Kindle.  But you need peanuts... and peanuts cost you $$.  I would like it better if you could earn peanuts rather than having to spend money.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|good return to action of the Ryan characters. I only wish that these books came more often. I appreciated that even though Clancy uses help from other authors he stays true to his style when using well known characters.
B007RE0RR8|4.0|My daughter saved up her money to purchase this item.  As soon as it arrived she was tearing into the box, so excited.  Item seemed to arrive in great condition, no complaints from her yet.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great ending to a fabulous series. It really draws you in and keeps you turning the pages. I would recommend the series highly.
B0064SHI9I|4.0|Over the last couple of weeks, while using my Droid HTC Incredible, I attempted to access MyBackup Pro's online servers to view and/or manage my stored data.  Unfortunately, an error message consistently appeared as follows:  \\"Could not connect to MyBackup online servers.  Your Internet connection is not working or our servers may be undergoing maintenance, please check your Internet connection, and restart the application.  If the problem persists, please try to reinstall the application.\\"<br /><br />After conferring with both the Developer (Rerware) and vendor (Amazon), I learned that the Amazon Appstore's current version (i.e., 3.0.2) is not updatable and, therefore, not sufficiently compatible to enable my Android device access to my stored online media and/or data.<br /><br />The problem resolution required a manual uninstall of Amazon's old version from the Android device followed by installation of the Developer's updated version (i.e., 3.3.0), which was provided by Rerware after I contacted support@rerware.com for assistance.  Finally, the support team provided an activation code that I used to complete the process.<br /><br />Note:  Media and/or data stored on my SD card were always fully accessible as well as online access to the identical information via my laptop after logging on to the MyBackup Web Viewer.  Regardless the aforementioned issue, I would recommend this extremely worthwhile app.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I've been using the facebook app on my android phone for some time, and have never been impressed.  Pictures don't load, posts are in no apparent order, even if I have it set up to be most recent.  The version that I've purchased for my Kindle Fire HD is better, but the app still has limitations that I cannot fathom existing, such as changing cover picture, occasionally forceclose, etc.  Better than the regular android though!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Was good but I like a more complicated plot Line. Sex could be more explicit too, overall I was entertained enough to keep reading.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|had no idea how loving the message was in this movie.  It was perfect for my family and made me smile.  Great for horse lovers and families who care about their children.
B009329ZF2|1.0|This movie was beyond horrible, the only real actor was Jesse Plemons.  He should have played the lead role.  What a complete waste of money, and how embarassing to have Rihanna act.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another great read by Ken Follett, which picks up where his first book left off. Again, he has fascinating characters worth caring about, and it's an entertaining history lesson.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this show! I only needed a few episodes because they were not on abc.com. this worked marvelously! Thank you Amazon!
B004T4LUPW|2.0|I have multiple calendars on my google calendar.  On my android, I have the Business Calendar app, which brings them all together.  On my Fire HD, I can't find one that will do it.  The stock calendar won't work, and CalenGoo...same thing, will not pull things from google efficently.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have enjoyed another Kay Scarpetta mystery. Thank you Ms. Cromwell. I look forward to another novel with all my favorite characters.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It was great - nice product but even a better show. We will be watching this several more time to pick up the British humor
B001NLKT60|5.0|I love this girl. She is so unassuming that everyone underestimates her strength, intellect, and determination. I couldn't put it down.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have always loved Ken Follett's historical novels, and this was no exception. One of the main reasons I love his stories is that he always has strong women characters, even when this was discouraged in the society in which they lived. I learned a great deal about the world as it plunged into WWI. I especially enjoyed the different viewpoints from the U.S., Britain, Germany and Russia, as well as from the different social strata of rich and poor. I have already ordered the 2nd book of the triology and can't wait to find out more.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The walking dead is by far my favorite show on television right now. I don't have AMC so I use Amazon. Works great for me to rewatch.
B008GFI418|3.0|George Martin is a mentor of mine.  He deserved a memorial video that took greater care.  It felt hurriedly put together, glossing over an incredible wealth of available material.  A great man; a mediocre video.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I cannot seem to get this program to download. I am extremely frustrated defenantly needs to be debugged and given a complete overview. Otherwise this is a worthless app and a complete waste of time.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|okay this game would be great EXCEPT I've had it for 6 days and have had to restart the game 5 times for no reason at all and certainly not by choice. I will come back to the game to because I'm notified that a baby is ready and it will be at the begin of the game! at one point I had reached to level 22 and had a large zoo with many animals I can back because a baby was ready and that was the last straw. this game SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is far better then I expected it to be. It does it's job and more than I realized. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|CUTE and fun, great for anypony that likes the show. Similar to most Facebook games, mostly free with the option of microtranactions
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I use Amazon to watch the walking dead because I don't have AMC on my television. This works great for me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John grisham is one of my favorite writers. The story line keeps you into the book right through the very end, Highly recommend it.
B001OSIV62|3.0|Unbelievable story but I think the good parts could've been told in under an hour.  Lots of fluff.  Still an unbelievable accomplishment.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Great action movie and good story plot,<br />Recommend you and won!t be upset.<br />Fasten your seat belt you'll travel into<br />A loop
B007MDB6L0|5.0|We loves these movies.  They are so much fun to watch, you can watch it over and over and still enjoy it.

B002ZG9774|2.0|I was excited to receive this item and I wanted to watch it. I don't like the fact that when I open the case the DVD when not in it's place and when I try one of them did not work at all. I tried it on different DVD players with no luck. lucky for me the other DVD did work. I won't buy a combo anymore.
B009AMALGM|5.0|We loves these movies.  They are so much fun to watch, you can watch it over and over and still enjoy it.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a very fun game to relax with, very easy to start and stop. Good game for all ages.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The sound on this is great, and it is surprisingly lightweight!  The surround sound is really great, but you have to have a program/file that supports it in order for it to not sound &#34;tinny&#34;. When you aren't using a program or playing a file that has surround sound, be sure to switch the switch off of virtualized surround sound so that it sounds better.<br /><br />I've tested the virtual surround sound with Battlefield 3, Medal of Honor (and Warfighter), Guild Wars 2, and while watching The Boondock Saints II, and they all work great and don't sound tinny. It's only when a stereo source plays that the sound gets crappy, and that's when you switch to stereo mode.<br /><br />The range on these is pretty impressive. I don't lose it no matter where I am in my room.<br /><br />My main gripe is a humming that occurs that I only notice when there is no sound being played.  I live in a dorm, so this could be because of interferences from other devices, but it's most likely an issue with something not being grounded right in my computer. Also, Logitech really needs to update their drivers to update your computer settings so that when you switch to stereo mode, it reconfigures the speakers so that there are only two. Otherwise, sometimes you will only get sound out of the right ear on stereo mode when a program is looking for surround speakers and thinks it is outputting to them.<br /><br />In short:<br /><br />PROs:<br />Lightweight, Comfortable<br />Useful buttons<br />Microphone can rotate up to be out of your way<br />Surround sound is great<br />Sound is great<br />Great signal range<br /><br />Cons:<br />Low noise buzzing, probably due to my environment or computer<br />Drivers need some work<br />Not idiot proof (doesn't bother me, but it bothers most of the people who have issues with the headset)
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great free app! Easy to use and set up. Like the options and flexible day selections. Wish my alarm clock on my night stand was as versatile.

B001I45UFC|5.0|I really like C.S Lewis and think that God blessed him with a talent of writing.  The Chronicles of Narnia was well written and I did not want to put the books down, this is coming form someone that is not a big reader.  He also puts little life lessons in each of the books, you will just have to read it and find them yourself.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Just as I had remembered it - I ordered it to replace on old VHS copy - Love to watch it at christmas
B007885IJU|5.0|This album did not disappoint.  We are now total Lumineers fans.  Fans of bands such as Mumford & Sons or Of Monsters & Men may appreciate this sound.
B0001I561E|1.0|I ordered a movie but when i got the mail i recived perfume instead i have no idea how that happens its not even close to being the same .... if i would have got another movie i think i would have understood but perfume is not even close ....

0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin does it again, with her usual meticulous, analytical, informative approach to presenting a historical situation. Really gives you the provenance of who did what and why. BTW, yes, I saw the movie.  8-)
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I am not much of a reader and I had a hard time putting the books down.  The Hunger Games is full of suspense, twists and turns, there was times that I laughed and times that I cried.
B0018OIK0E|3.0|It's an OK movie.  There were some funny scenes, but not enough of them to make this movie better than OK.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Love the show!  Before ordering the season I had only caught a few episodes of Season 1 in rerun/Hulu.  Loved the show so much that I just picked up the full season.
B005LF9OCE|3.0|Should have just waited for it to come out on Netflix or reruns.  That's what happens when you are impatient.
1419702238|5.0|Good series to get my children interested in reading.  Arguable the best book of the series in my opinion.  Strong hardback exterior which I was not expecting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book series. It was so interesting and different from what I have been reading lately. Can't wait till the film comes out!
B0068THAGY|4.0|I did not know what to expect, and the story line kept me guessing, but the characters were so lovable and the kids were such excellent actors, I stayed on board for the ride.  It reminded me of several other movies, but also offers something special of its own.
1451695195|3.0|I felt there was entirely to much emphasis on the medical explanations as to what happened and not enough content about the experiences encountered while &#34;dead&#34; or during his NDE . His approach failed to make a strong case for the existence of heaven.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|The lead role plays his typical character from Friday Night Lights but that is definitely not a bad thing for me.  He keeps to his sultry serious looks with the behind the scenes bad boy intent.  Good movie to escape with.
B004I744AS|5.0|easy to use and easy to learn specifics. all in all great app for the price of nothing. plenty of other add one to occupy time.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This is simply hardcore from start to finish.  This is the best reboot that I have seen so far this year.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|This is definitely not &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; as I have grown to know it through other versions and movies over the years, but it was an easy read and it was nice to read around Christmas time :-)
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I will read or watch anything about or written by Austen or her stories. I might sound bias when I say this was a cute adorable and funny re imagining of Pride and Prejudice but it really is. And the lead actress Jemima Rooper is perfect in her role as an Austen obsessed modern girl. If you are willing to see this film as a fun take on the original novel and not be one of those stick in the muds who get all hot and bothered that someone played with the idea of Darcy and Elisabeth then this is worth watching. I don't want to spoil the movie with too much detail so i will just say rent it stream it or buy it is a good little rainy day watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First off I want to say that I am not an adamant reader by no means. This is only the second book I have read since purchasing my new Kindle. I have not read a whole book in the past 4 years, because my ADD kicks in. I would read a chapter and then not remember it, but somehow come up with what to have for dinner that night. All this to say...this book left me wanting more and I couldn't put it down. The writer truly knows how to capture your attention and keep you guessing the entire book. I give it 5 stars not only on how great the book is, but that I actually made it through it entirely without being hungry.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|The minute I saw the package I knew this film was really old the back lable and expiration date hade been peeled away.  Really dissipointed as this was a gift for my mom who was longing to use her beloved Polaroid camara again. Paid over 40 dollars for absolutely nothing, photos came out black.
B000F8O2PG|4.0|Gave this for a gift so I cannot really review it well.  The cast is talented and stories are captivating once you understand the main chacters. It is a good series that I will miss out on. Reruns show on cable or demand TV.
B007V65R54|5.0|Very good book. The book is well written and I like the topics covered from baseball, terrorism, and politics. I would recommend to anybody.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Perfect winter read! Kept turning the pages on this one! I never knew what was coming next. Can't wait to \\"lend\\" this book to all my friends! :)

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Yes, I know I am an man but the human touchs and emotions in this book cannot make it anything else but an must read if you like history.. Thank you
B0053O89WY|5.0|it was a gift to my daughter she loved it and watched it within days of getting it. we are going to borrow it soon
B00866JL96|5.0|I liked this movie because it was a love affair that when you are with a bunch of teenage girls for a sleepover, it is just a wonderful film to watch with friends.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you're a fan already, this is a continuation of the great Season 1.  If not, watch season 1 first and you will be a fan.  I wouldn't recommend starting with season 2 because you probably will be a little lost.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It has been a lot of fun to play. I am by no means a gammer, but have been able to progress some.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|GREAT BOOK!  Full of surprises.  A book I could not put down.  All the reviews before mine say it all! A book I will recommend/)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The game's  story line is intelligent.  If things moved quicker it would be better. Graphics are very good. I think it has the potential to be very good.
1583334386|4.0|What perfect timing! Everyone always spends January resolving to change every perceived fault, so why not read a book that will teach you how self control works, why it matters, and what you can do to get even more of it?<br /><br />Thanks to the BlogHer Book Club, I started off my new year (and the end of the last one) reading The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It by Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D. Dr. McGonigal teaches a groundbreaking course at Stanford University called \\"The Science of Willpower\\". This course has \\"helped hundreds of people achieve their goals by understanding the science behind why we give in to temptation, and how we can find the strength to resist.\\"<br /><br />The first thing I learned was that willpower is about harnessing the three powers of I will, I won't, and I want to help achieve your goals. Harnessing these power challenges can be used towards any goal, whether it be losing weight, quitting smoking, or pulling back on the excess spending. I started off the book by notating what the willpower challenge was that I wanted to focus on.<br /><br />I will eat healthier.<br /><br />I won't eat crap.<br /><br />I want to lose weight.<br /><br />After Thanksgiving I had already made a bit of a resolution to stop drinking soda. Except for one splurge on New Years Eve, I've been caffeinated soda free since. I wanted to take that a step further and encourage myself to eat better on a regular basis. My weight has been slowly climbing and I am now at the heaviest I've been without being pregnant. It's not just the number on the scale, but the way I feel about my body. My self confidence is pretty low right now. So, I wanted to learn how to strengthen my willpower when it came to making choices towards my goal.<br /><br />What I really liked about McGonigal's book, was her style. The writing is very casual, with a little humor thrown in to keep it fun, and even when she's talking about what the parts of the brain do and how they affect your self control, it's in a way that doesn't make it sound like a textbook. It gave me the feeling that McGonigal would be a very fun person to hang out with.<br /><br />One of the primary things I took away from The Willpower Instinct, was how important it is to train my brain to focus. I have difficulty with focusing on one thing at a time, and McGonigal attempted to teach me how to properly meditate. When I used to try, I always got frustrated that my mind kept getting away from me. I couldn't clear my mind. What McGonigal explains, is that meditating doesn't have to be about focusing perfectly on your breath and getting rid of everything else. What it's really about, is catching yourself moving away from the goal (concentrating on `inhale', `exhale') and bringing your thoughts back there. So even when I started wondering about how much time had past, what I was going to write in my review, things I needed to finish for work, what's for lunch, that was not a sign of failure. Instead, I succeeded in reminding myself to go back to the breath each time I caught my mind wandering. I'm still finding 5-10 minutes every day where I can just close my eyes and get back to my focus training.<br /><br />Reading this book also helped me make not only smarter choices (towards my eating healthy goal and others), but also helped make me more aware when I am faced with a choice that could derail me from my goals. Shortly after finishing one chapter, I reached for an orange rather than a chocolate cookie. When took my lunch breaks at work, I was more conscious of my choices. More often than not, I chose to read a book with my lunch rather than mindlessly surfing the internet. I also learned to forgive myself each misstep (like when I had ice cream for dessert), and not use it as an excuse to abandon my entire goal.<br /><br />I'm the type to pick out self help books, read a couple of chapters, and then eventually give up. There was something about McGonigal's writing that really kept me interested in the subject. If you're looking to read about self control and how you improve your own, you should really check out The Willpower Instinct. The difference in the way I look at my actions and my thoughts regarding my long-term goals will stay with me long after this book gets put on the shelf.<br /><br />[This review originally appeared on Unintentionally-Brilliant.com]<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from the publisher for this review.

0765325950|5.0|If you have read the series through Towers of Midnight, you should not find any spoilers here.  Of course, if you have read through Towers of Midnight, you're going to buy this book, so why do you need to read my review!<br /><br />(1) The book itself. Truly, a phenomenal ending to a difficult and detail-packed series. I laughed, I smacked my couch, I applauded, I groaned aloud, I cried. This series had not provoked me to tears before this book, but I cried most of the last 100 pages.<br /><br />There is no doubt that this series sagged in the middle. The final three books, and this one particularly, make it all worthwhile. Truly. If you put the series down, I cannot urge you enough to pick it back up so that you can get here.<br /><br />I was astonished at the efficiency and beauty with which Team Jordan started tying off the loose threads. So many endings were just perfect. Moiraine's return gave me goosebumps, as did Lan's charge into Tarwin's Gap. Rand coming to peace with himself and his role, crafting a plan from Min's research - brilliant, and revealed with perfect pacing. Mat's generalship is finally on display to its utmost. Forsaken schemes are revealed - and YES, we finally find out what Demandred has been up to!<br /><br />It's not perfect. Not all the loose ends we might want to hear from are tied off, and we are left with questions that won't ever be answered. Perrin's particular confrontation in the Last Battle grew a little redundant for my tastes. One persistent menace from the series was disposed of almost too easily. That said - it's very, very good.<br /><br />(2) A quick word on the product itself rather than the content of the book: I pre-ordered this book and received it the afternoon of January 7th. The front cover's spine was badly torn, and the binding was nearly falling off. I hope that mine was a limited experience and not related to the first run of the book. Amazon did a great job handling my return and I am satisfied with my experience.<br /><br />(3) Finally, stop giving this product a one-star review because you're unhappy a related product, the eBook, doesn't exist. That was Harriet's call and no one else's. I may disagree with it, but that does not detract from the book itself.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Reflected in You is the second in the Crossfire series about the romance between Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross. Both Eva and Gideon are sexual abuse survivors, and so their relationship is understandable volatile. Their desire for each other is passionate (ahem), but I feel it verges on an unhealthy obsession. For both participants.<br /><br />The publishers of Reflected in You also provided BlogHer Book Club reviewers with a copy of the first book in Sylvia Day's Crossfire series, Bared to You. Since they were so kind, I took the time to read both books prior to this review.<br /><br />This is a series that is for mature audiences only. It almost crosses the border between literary smut and just smut for the sake of smut. Arguments, even small disagreements, are ignored so the pair can give into their carnal pleasures. Again and again. As graphically pleasing and enticing as the sex scenes were, I do feel it was all in excess.<br /><br />In the beginning, as I read Bared to You, I found myself enjoying it (ahem). The story was good, there was intrigue into the pasts of these two characters, and I might have fallen in love with the emotionally damaged Cary Taylor, Eva's best friend and roommate. He's just as damaged as Eva and Gideon, but he felt more `real' to me than any other character in the series. Other peripheral characters (such as Eva's boss, mother, and pretty much Gideon's entire family) were cardboard cutouts of the stereotypes we find in our lives.<br /><br />When I got to Reflected in You, I was bored. Eva and Gideon went through the same motions, making the same mistakes, time and again. There was more digging into the pasts of these characters, and where their futures might lead, but I feel that these two books could have been melded into one. Instead of Eva making the same mistake of jumping to conclusions about Gideon's feelings about her actions twenty times, maybe cut it down to two or three. That would cut out half of each book. There's a lot offiller that could be slashed, and then the saga of Eva and Gideon could be one regular length novel. I don't know what's left for the third book (well, I do, but even that could probably be reduced into the single book), but I'll probably read it. I have to know the ending. I have to know what happens. And I have to know if these two insanely sexual people continue to have passionate sex every other chapter.<br /><br />Entwined with You, the third book in the series, is not scheduled for release until May 7, 2013. By that time, I'll have probably lost interest in wanting to know what is in Gideon's past that he's been hiding from Eva. Sylvia Day could have done a decent job with one book, named it Crossfire, and then moved away from Eva and Gideon. If she's set on a series, I'd like to see more of Cary Taylor's story. But that's just the opinion from the peanut gallery.<br /><br />[This review originally appeared on Unintentionally-Brilliant.com.]<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />***I received a copy of Reflected in You from Penguin Publishing, and was compensated for this BlogHer Book Club review. I also received a copy of Bared to You, but a review was not expected from the publisher. All opinions expressed are my own.***
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|I use the 10 and 15 minute workouts at work. It beats not doing anything at all...I would recommend this app.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I enjoy LinkedIn, I really do, but this app really didn't help with the much.  The appeal for an app to be linked to the actual website seems like a great idea until you come to find that the whole app doesn't really allow you to check on anything.  I preferred going to the actual website instead, least I could do more with that.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Highly engaging, descriptive book. I recommended it to several friends. Easy to read on the kindle. My first &#34;bought&#34; book!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|It's kind of predictable, and it seems unrealistic. The ending also seems unresolved. It's quick read though, a good story though.
0765325950|1.0|Yes I am upset also by the foolish decision to wait months to release the ebook version, first you keep delaying the release and now this???? Thoroughly disappointed!! Hopefully all the outrage might make them reconsider.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a different approach by the author in that it jumped back and forth from past to present in every other chapter. It made it a bit difficult to follow at first, but I really wanted to know how it ended, and enjoyed the book very much.
B0098A1TEE|5.0|I randomly heard the song back it up on the radio and loved it so much I decided to search for the artist. She's got an old jazzy sound with new beats and music. I really love the whole album.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game I try and play it everyday but some thins are a little slow and some things see a little to childish but love it
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|I totally loved this movie.  Meryl Streep is fantastic (as always).  Pierce Brosnan is great.  I had no idea Pierce and Collin Firth could sing and very well I might add.  The music numbers were outstanding.  The only other musical I've ever liked is The Sound of Music and this ranks right up there in my opinion - even though the story line isn't near as accomplished.  If you don't like music by Abba you won't like this movie...but if you do, you love it as I do.
0783240287|5.0|I have loved this musical ever since it came out.  It fits the Bible story quite well.  Would recommend it.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This is a wonderfully written account of a family in crisis with a member who has a terminal chronic illness. It is a great read and I will also use it in end of life discussion for class
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie is so brilliantly written and shot, I really enjoyed it.  It is not for people who want to just casually watch a movie, there is a lot of information and different periods of time in the past and future that all mix together.  We paused it a few times just to make sure we had our heads wrapped around what was going on.  All in all, I loved it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Many great twists and turns to the story. Nothing better than the \\"ah ha!\\" moments throughout bringing it all together. Great book.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Another Christmas gift but I did watch this one. It was a good quality buy and fast delivery. I would buy more DVDs,
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Just got done reading this book. Loved it! Going online now to buy book 2 !! Hope is just as good!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Lots of violence and blood, but a terrific story with excellent acting.  Based on a true story, period piece set during Prohibition.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Wow. This app is SO GREAT!!! I had no idea that I would Ever be able to use my KINDLE to take so many  AWESOME PICS AND VIDS!! There's only ONE thing that would make this the perfect camera app for the Kindle. Sometimes, I'll find myself needing hour long video capabilities; as of rite now, the longest video I've been able to make is 33'55&quot; long using 480p settings. Otherwise I really LOVE this app and quite frankly, I'M in love with its Creator! (Call me, maybe?)
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is something fun and new. I like it, and will be able to play it for a while to come.
B006WXHJNU|4.0|It was good to find an older movie. It was a Christmas wish list gift and the person I bought it for was really pleased.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|this one fits together pretty well, unlike Sideswipe.  It also has a good feel to it, articulates well, pleasing design.  Only issue I have is the back piece in robot mode isn't anchored down, and can make it a bit more difficult to hold by the torso.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I rate this book for 5 stars because I love diary of a wimpy kid it's like the best book ever
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a lot harder than it looked. You actually have to think ahead, but it is easy to fix mistakes. I have not had any technical problems yet
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I enjoy waking up to music on my Kindle using this application. Volume increases slowly to ease the sleeper to wakefulness.
B00466HM28|1.0|Too good to be true. For its price, you don't expect much, but it fails to meet even low standards of functionality where its midi editing software is concerned. PC programming was easy to learn, but had bizarre and apparently random results when used with FL Studio in Windows 7.<br />I was delighted with the prospect of PC software because of its ease of visibility and verifiable program changes unheard of on midi controllers in this price range without integral LCD displays. The product boasts of the ability to assign different midi channels to knobs and pads from that assigned to keys, which was a chief reason I purchased this. Unfortunately, programmed midi value assignments shown on screen, while working different channel assignments, were inconsistent with reality. Judging from AKAi's troubleshooting literature online and users' forums, there may be a problem with Windows 7 compatibility. Although I am not a MIDI expert, neither am I a novice. I use M-Audio Oxygen 49 with relatively easy plug and play and (LED Alpha-Numeric Only) display, which facilitates simple midi channel assignments to its myriad controls.<br />  With the low price point, AKAI's tech support is what you might expect. Practically nonexistent. I got tired of waiting for responses from them and ended up returning the product after spending-no lie- at least 12 hours going exhaustively and repeatedly through every alternate setup scenario I could think of because I really wanted this baby to work for me becouse of its compactness.<br />  On the positive side, If you simply need a straight forward controller to transmit all data over the same MIDI channel, this little guy might serve your needs. The pads are not super responsive, but are workable. Definitely not a fatal flaw there. Likewise with the knobs which are functional, but cannot easily, for example, be adjusted by rolling with a single curved pinky finger, but rather have to be very deliberately gripped between thumb and forefinger. But then you expect that for the price. AKAI, if you are listening, please, please develop this same size product with professional quality components and charge more for it. A mini-key controller which is not a toy and has updated software would be a product I would gladly pay more for, but apparently that animal is not available at any price by any manufacturer. I had high hopes for the M-Audio Axiom AIR Mini 32 and ordered it to replace the AKAI, but returned it because the pads really sucked, I had difficulty programming it, and M-Audio is a no-show where tech support is concerned. They never bothered to return phone calls or e mails, much like AKAI, although there seemed to be no problem with the Windows 7 with this more recently-introduced product.

B0090SI3ZW|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the old time kung fu movies. When I saw the trailer for Man With The Iron Fists it looked like a movie tailor made for me. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />I watched the first half of the movie before growing bored and wandering out of theater. During the many hours I spent watching the first half - or at least it seemed that long - I saw absolutely nothing to indicate that any actor or stunt-man appearing in the movie had ever had a martial arts lesson. Seriously, the fight choreography looked like what a bunch of school boys, with absolutely no martial arts background, might put together trying to copy what they saw in Kung fu Theater. Maybe there was some martial arts in the 2nd half of the movie, I didn't make it that far. I later learned that there were a couple real martial artists in this movie. Based on what I saw on the screen, I never would have figured that out.<br /><br />What Iron Fist did have, in abundance, was lots and lots of bright red fluid. I couldn't begin to tell you how many limbs were severed in the first 15 minutes. There was one scene where one \\"martial artist\\" rips the arms off another \\"martial artist\\" using something that was possibly some kind of tiger style. There was a guy in a suit full of switchblades that does a lot of jumping and spinning and severing of arteries. There's also Russell Crowe who seems to know even less about fighting than the uncoordinated \\"martial artists.\\" But he has a pair of scissors with a pistol grip that he uses to disembowel his clumsy opponents.<br /><br />The sets and cinematography were first rate, impressive but not impressive enough to make up for the terrible writing, directing and fight choreography. The costumes looked like a lot of thought and a lot of money had gone into them. Iron Fist had a $20 million budget, and was shot in China where that kind of money will go pretty far. It's a shame that RZA didn't spring for a first rate choreographer. But it's also a shame that the movie wasn't better written and directed. The real shame of it is that all the ingredient to make a good kung fu movie were in place, the only thing missing was a recipe and someone who knew how to mix them.<br /><br />If you're a fan of simulated blood, simulated amputations and simulated disembowelments - and couldn't care less if anyone on the screen could actually kick their way out of a paper bag - this is the movie for you.

B009MF5BXK|5.0|This spin off of The Expendables is loaded with lots of action and comedy. I look forward to the arrival of The Expendables 3 and in the Out takes video, the new script is already in discussion.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|todo excelente solo para fanáticos y escucharlo a todo volumen en 5.1 un placer - las postaleslas voy a hacer cuadro
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I don't use it as often as I could. It is set up so it is very easy to use.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed reading Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy.  The book did an awesome job teaching the history of World War II.  I have recommended the book to all of my friends.
B0012YYZYU|1.0|The dvd did not play in any of our devices (dvd players [non blue ray] and laptops).  It kept coming up with the error message that read &#34;cannot read disc&#34;.  Had to return it and hope to get my money back.
1419705849|5.0|MY GRANDSON HAS ALL OF THESE BOOKS, GOOD CLEAN READING FOR YOUNG AND OLD A LIKE, I DO SAY THEY WILL KEEP YOU INTERESTED
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|A lol best of the series!!! Super funny, best ever, Diary of a Wimpy Kid!! I loved it Mr. Kinney.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|How can anyone not love this CD?  I am a huge Santana fan and would highly recommend this CD to anyone. Great job!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Liked it a lot. What a rush . Fun to read. Great time to get involved in the series frenzy.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Amazingly fun game I originally got with one of the Humble Bundles.  Love it!  Only critque would be that it may be better suited toward large screen phones.  I use it on my Galaxy S II pretty well, but sometimes it seems my screen is a hindrance.  Even so, love the game and play it often.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I almost didn't download this game, thinking it was for children. I'm glad I changed my mind. It's loads of fun, with levels of graduated difficulty. Plus, the pudding monsters are kind of cute.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book has well plotted twists that no would expect the outcome. I genuinely loved this book, and when it was over I wanted to cry because I have become so attached to the characters that I did not want to let them go.
B0090EIILU|1.0|Since Borat I've found Sasha Baron Cohen's movies to get less funny and more crude.  It's rare that I'll turn off a movie but I just couldn't make it to the end of this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This has to one of the best novels by Nicholas Sparks, I had to get audible so I could listen while driving. Now, and can't wait for the movie to come out!! Until then I will be The Best of Me, yet, another novel by the same author. A+++ in my opinion!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love the CrossMe game, this one with color and the other black & white version.  Both a great time kill.  Challenging puzzles to use a &#34;suduko&#34; type logic to create images.  Great fun!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had so much. It was a little sad, but it had so much meaning in it. In the begining I didn't know where it would take me. It kept me guessing, and I was tempted to look up some spoilers, but decided I would stick it out. I'm so glad I did. This book was amazing. It will be a book that sticks with me for a while.
B00846REIS|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES.  I WAS NEVER A ROMANTIC SAPPY INDIVIDUAL, HOWEVER THIS BOOK AND THE SEQUEL BECAME AN ADDICTION.  IT HAS COMICAL MOMENTS THAT ANY REAL WOMAN CAN RELATE TO (I.E. I LAUGHED AT SOME OF THE MAIN CHARACTER'S THOUGHTS IN RESPONSE TO THIS MAN'S EGO TRIP--EXCESSIVE CONTROL POWER TRIP...IT CAN BE HOT, BUT IT ALSO CAN BE TOO MUCH).  IT CAN BE REALISTIC AND FICTION, SIMULTANEOUSLY.  AFTERALL, USUALLY MEN WITH POWER AREN'T EXCLUSIVE, AND WHAT WOMAN DOESN'T WANT HER OWN RIGHTS TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF AS SHE IS ENTITLED TO?<br /><br />SYLVIA DAY AND R.L. MATTHEWSON ARE MY TWO NEW FAVORITE AUTHORS!  IF YOU WANT TO LAUGH, AND DREAM ABOUT A SEXY MAN PROTECTING YOU, AND ESCAPE THE LACK THEREOF IN REALITY....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TWO BOOKS (REFLECTED IN YOU BEING THE SECOND PART).<br /><br />I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT WAIT FOR THE THIRD BOOK TO BE RELEASED IN MAY!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was envious of my girlfriend when she got her Kindle; but when I got my coby tablet, I thought that I had a good device for an e reader. The tablet had an e reader installed on it, but I wanted to access more than what it offered so I downloaded Kindle for android. You take tech for granted until something goes wrong; and it did. My whole library was wiped out! I called and they had my whole library on file and helped me get it all, ALL back. Great tech, wonderful customer service. Now again I want a Kindle!
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Great Free App if you love Moon watching, planning something outside or even if your interested in astronomy. Has lots of neat little tools and graphs and great graphics. Using it on my Kindle Fire with no problems
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds - the original addict phone game.  Now they've added all sorts of cool weapons to use and new levels.  I played through it ages ago when it first came out.  It was the biggest hit around the office.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The unique circling of point of view characters is amazing. The HBO tv show is almost as good as the book.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a smooth and easy read. I like the format(correspondence) and the fact that you could finish it in a day or two.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban music is my favorite music.  Josh has a beautiful voice.  I can listen all day to his music.  He is a phenominal artist, a very creative musician and a great performer.  I have seen him in live performances and would go again and again to concerts in which he performs.  This CD is a must to have if you have a CD collection of classical background music.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|The paided Version of this Game was totally worth the hours of fun ! Absolutly would recommend this to anyone who loves Music,games, and fun!
B0027MJU00|3.0|Like all of Gillian Flynns books , this is not a story for the depressed., and has a psychological theme. However I thought the novel dragged somewhat in the middle. The main protagonists were believeable, and not very likeable. Mrs. Flynn caught the themes of the 1980's in the bible belt though well, and this was the basis of the murders. The victims were well devoped and believeable, almost more so than the main characters.
0525951652|5.0|this book is not for thr light of heart is is full of history romance and a nice story line cant wait to read the next in his seris
0307730697|4.0|....which it is. The real thing, not the &#34;Seal&#34; novels that &#34;feel&#34; like they are more fiction than truth.  A real American Patriot!  God Bless men like this.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|... Only wish that the song &#34;HOME&#34; wasn't commercialized, but I appreciate capitalism and support for the artist ... Enjoyable album.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Great app to try and use, even if you dont end up buying the full version like I did. Excellent way to see if you will like it without the commitment of a purchase. No problems , and use it on my Kindle fire.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a believable story of a troubled adolescent boy coming of age,and into good mental health.The importance of his friends in his journey into adulthood is very well described and and a vitally important part of adolescence.
034580404X|3.0|i read this this because i thought it was good and everyone else was reading it i would not read another by her it makes women look stupid and helples s and degrading
0765325950|1.0|No ebook is arrogant and shows a blatant disregard for customer needs especially for those people who have been supporting the series for over 20 years.  Bad form Harriet.
B004GJVI5C|4.0|I thought this movie was decent, not great or fantastic as the fanfare a couple years back would make you believe.  The acting was great and writing was good, it just left me wanting a little more.  Worth the rental if you'd like to see something different from the normal &#34;good guy&#34; point of view.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This App is ok . It loads facebook but only gives 3 updates at a time when you turn it on...Even if the last time you turned it on was more than a day ago. If this issue could be fixed would get more stars from me ..
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great story of a pschopathic marriage, with one member of the couple just an average guy with little self awareness. Neither one of the couple is very likeable, and for me the development of the characters is the story. However the book kept me guessing throughout,and took some real twists.. The ending was realistic, if dissapointing, but nobody--except the hero's sister, and the female detective deserved a happy ending. An excellant read
1419701533|5.0|Bought these for my 9 year old daughter for a Christmas gift and she was estatic. She has already 2 books out of the series and has a hard time putting them down when reading.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I haven't read a Grisham novel for several years, so when I read the sample, I became interested again.  Novel has good character delineation, very believable plot, nothing too predictable. Once I got into the novel, had a hard time putting it down.  Started rooting for main character early into the novel and was somewhat surprised at the novel's ending.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Steven King does a great job here of connecting what we know about the past and what we can guess might have happened.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Great Free app for the holidays. Downloaded it and had the whole family challenging top scores. Great holiday music selection that everyone will enjoy! No problems downloading or any glitches , using it on my Kindle Fire~
B004KKXMSI|5.0|The first movie in the trilogy is still one of the best action movies ever, with some of the best effects, and scariest predators, with underlying warnings about meddling with DNA, life, and presumptions about the intelligence and dominance of the human species.<br />The second movie is my least favorite--still great special effects, great cast and acting, but basically King Kong rewritten with a deadly dinosaur as the object of potential profit and city-destroyer.<br />The last movie seemed the more fitting sequel to the first:  the dinosaur is no longer just villainous predator, but intelligent other, with grudging respect given by both parties by movie's end.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Calvin Harris knows how to rock it!! With songs like bounce and sweet nothing you know that you are getting a Great album!!
B0007939NO|5.0|How can you not love Brigadoon.  It's a classic and one of my favorites.  Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse are wonderful in this movie!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This did just what I wanted it to. It woke me up at the time that I set it for. It's easy to use, too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Downloaded this on my Kindle fire after playing on my Samsung Galaxy phone . Lots of fun , like the old carnaval games for coins . Have this app on 4 phones in our house .
0380973650|3.0|Loved the combination of myth, social science, religion.  The main character is fairly well drawn, the action/suspense of the plot is well done, but the gods were barely more than a plot device in the book, the pursued and pursuer, with not much fleshing out or real relationship established between them and the people they followed to the New World.  The set-up held such promise--why do we worship or discard deities?  what makes them endangered:  culture, modernity, science, knowledge, callousness, cynicism....?  WHO are they--quasi-human meddlers, like the classic Greek gods, our shadow selves, given only the powers we allow them, another race, our ego and flaws...?  Something about the book, although plenty hefty, felt incomplete, like there was much left out.  I kept thinking I would find the rest of the story in the next chapter, but I never did.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This storey has something for all to relate too... the things you see and don't through out life. This book helped at least myself see things. Sometimes the book was repetitive, sometimes I wanted him to get to the fn point. But in all circumstances I loved it!
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Wonderful Movie!  Great family movie!  We are new to the book series and the movies do NOT disappoint.  Best of the three movies so far!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|would recommend this to any Led Zeppelin fans.  Watching the DVD was wishing i was able to go and see them in person.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope the movie is as good........ this book has so much drama and suspense. Loved it a lot..
B000JBWWRY|5.0|got this in time for a Christmas present for a very special Great Grandchild and was quite pleased in the promptness of the order
B008JGSM6G|3.0|My grandson and I love to play this game.  We even got grandpa hooked.  However, when we reached the 9x9 at level 19 there is a dead square right in the middle.  Game over.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Johnny English will keep you in stitches,sort of like British Keystone Kops.I recommend it to every age group.Buy it now
B008GXHOFW|4.0|The graphics are good but the graphics have to load buildings only 10 feet away. Plus the black suit is just spider man painted black unlike how the picture shows it like how it is in the old comics and he only gets one more power that Doesn't even hurt bad guys. His voice is also queery. Other than that graphics and fighting and upgrading is alright.
0060245867|5.0|Childhood favorite and brought it for my little one he really likes it! Hes only 3 and is reading it cover to cover already (by memory) Mines didnt come with the paper cover over it but It still had a cute little design! Good buy!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover feels great and looks even better in person I've only had for a few weeks now but i think this one is going to last a long time.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|this is a good game but it requires having friends who also play to finish quest plus it is not a must but u can not get far unless u spend real money to get peanuts
B0049J3QF4|5.0|We enjoyed this movie because there are no ridiculous scary parts for small children. There are a couple of words that aren't the greatest (i.e. &#34;moron&#34;), but for the most part was very toddler-friendly. We appreciated the humor and Pixar's ingenuity that keeps adults entertained alongside children.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Far better than than Spider Man this game has great graphics. Although fighting when  seven guys and a chopper are on you does get a little complicated when trying to level up, there are no major flaws. He has great gadgets and vehicles and using stealth is awesome. Great game.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|This present was opened on Christmas and had to immediately be put together by my nephew who is 6 years old. Him and his Dad sat for about an hour and put the entire thing together. It turned out great. It is a fun, well made addition to his Star Wars collection. Being a Star Wars fan myself who was around for the original movies, I want one for myself !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is an awesome game most of the time. the only thing is that you have to earn so many points.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I saw this on a tv commercial  l thought  it looked interesting  so when I received my new kindle fire it was my first book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was an absorbing read full of entertaining plot.  I read Sharp Objects by the same author, and there was a clear improvement in plot and writing from that book to Gone Girl.  My only hard critique would be that it definitely requires 'the willing suspension of disbelief' a few times, but in all that does not detract from the reading experience.  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a twist on the theme of a marriage in crisis.  I read it for a book club, and it led to some lively discussion in group.
B0034G4P4O|1.0|Best movie, hands down. A big recommendation to purchase this movie from me!<br /><br />Also, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TINTIN! You are awesome. 1929--1/10/13
B001N3EZW2|5.0|One of my all time favorite science fiction films and will watch it at the drop of a hat should it be on TCM or if I feel the need to watch it on a rainy day. Can't miss movie, and anything with Robby the Robot is worth watching.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was so surprised to find Facebook for my Kindle in a format that I understood and could quickly learn.  This is my first trek away from a desktop pc and the Facebook app made my day.
075669812X|5.0|7 year old wanted Llyod (Green Ninja)  and was impossible to find over Christmas.  Saw this and was a great two in one combo.  Great minifigure with a description of all Lego Ninjago sets.  One of his favorite Christmas presents!  Worth every penny.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Very cute little movie. I enjoyed it very much and I can't wait for the next one to come out!
0446310786|5.0|Scout Finch grows up in 1940's while learning that the world is not as fair as she thinks it should be.  As she is coming of age she deals with things like being lady, racial issues, and hate crimes.  Although the last two usually come hand and hand.  The book is mostly about Scout growing up and that there is a trial that is judge by the jury more by race the evidence.  Scout her brother Jem separately deal with the outcome of the trial.<br /><br />I was surprised at how much I did enjoy this.  Years ago it was assigned to our English class and I hate reading for school. So I never read it then but watch the movie with Cary Grant in class.  Now I haven't seen the movies in years but I mostly remember it being on the trial.  The  trial is a part of the book but there is so much more to it.<br /><br />I can not think of anything I did not like in this book.  Love it and can see why it is a classic
B003GXJ072|5.0|There's been nothing before or since this film came out that's anywhere near as good as this science fiction film with a great dose of horror thrown in for good measure. Probably have seen it 4 dozen times over the yrs and always something that shows itself that I hadn't noticed before, a can't miss film.
B00846TRHY|4.0|Lots of action and an inspiring true story. We all need to support the children who are suffering.  We are big Gerard Butler fans.
0062009540|3.0|Just got in today book was water damaged but intact, also stained but fine. Looking forward to reading it. Three stars.
B00190OHD6|2.0|Has it's moments. Good soundtrack and great looks of beautiful Ireland. But its pretty much too far over-the-top.<br /><br />The attempted connection with Harry Connick Jr. was pretty disgusting.
B002XXLKL0|3.0|The movie was both very silly and very creepy. I'm glad I didn't let my little kids watch it when it first came out.
B003B02O14|5.0|Keeps you on the edge. Very disappointing ending. I wanted Eva to be there waiting for him. Or maybe someone found her.
B00005JNQS|1.0|way too many inuendos about sex; leave it on the shelf or rent from netflix so your children don't watch it over and over
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I thought that this book was wonderful. It was full of suspense, drama, and secrets. This is  a book that will keep readers on the edge of their seat and up all night reading. City of Bones is the most suspenseful, and most beautifully detailed books of the decade. WOW is all I can say.
B008RYN44U|3.0|I like the CD but its not as good as their older ones, but I think its something you got to hear a lot.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Thanks for offering this. Only wish I bought the version with the extra feature. But love the movie!  Looing forward to the next movie.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Having seen the original short many times, we wondered how this would be.  It is awesome, I saw it in the theater, pre-ordered the  DVD, and paid for instant streaming so my hubby and I could see it together.  I will watch it over and over, just like I do the Nightmare Before Christmas....  Tim Burton Rocks!!!
B003A6X0P8|5.0|For years I had been reading about this show. It was way better than I expected. This is a great companion to the This Time Around- Live In Japan disc. If your like your music raw, live and jamming than this is a great disc for you!
0525953728|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down. Took me 2 days from start to finish.  So good that I bought my husband one for Christmas for when he travels.  I learned a new respect for these honorable men!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|The info you have on your mobile phone as well as your kindle is valuable and should be protected. This will help you to do that along with other valuable features which will help locate a lost phone/kindle
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun it is like monster life and it is great for 5 year olds if it had owls it would be way runner
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Got this for the husband for Christmas. He is a major Dr Who fan and Christopher Eccelston is his favorite doctor. I made fun of him for watching Dr Who, until I got hooked this past fall. We watched this DVD set over the course of a few days and I quickly wish that I would have had more!!
0525478817|4.0|I rarely read books regarding cancer because I work in the field but my coworkers recommended this book so I read it.  I really thought it was well written, funny, insightful and sad
B005HSG3TC|5.0|When I received this I was very happy and knew that it was just looking for.  I knew I made a wise decision in buying it. But then when I got out my Kindle I found that this was a 7\\" folio not the 8.9\\" I needed for my Kindle. Regretfully I had to return it. If you need one of this size I recommend the folio as well as the vendor.
B008MAI0WK|4.0|It is very well writted and clear about the problems you can find during your first steps with the Raspberry PI.<br /><br />A lot of key information about the power requirements and trouble you can have if you have less power than spected. Wifi set ups and compatible hardware, keyboards, remotes, and some about the Linux distro and others OS you can install and run on the Raspberry PI.<br /><br />A lot of info can be finded on online forums and lists but in the book it is ordered, clearly writted and with simple solutions or workarounds.<br /><br />This is why I consider it a &#34;must&#34; for new users and don´t be dissapointed.
B009YMNVMO|5.0|the kids love this movie, I love this movie, its awesome, Cant get enough. We've watched it so many times, the quality is excellent on my Kindle Fire too. Love the X-Ray feature also. :)
B000660UN0|5.0|This album is blues at its best. I couldn't believe my husband actually grabbed me to dance!! Buy this album if you love the blues!! :D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Emotional rollercoaster.  Exotic and insightful about a young woman's fast journey into the darker side of sexual relationships. Would recommend to anyone, man or woman.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|This a compelling retelling of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey in a contemporary American genre.  Kevin Kostner, James Earl Jones, and Burt Lancaster provide acting heft to a modern myth that many men, including this reviewer, have found moving and powerful.  The &#34;Atonement&#34; or, as Campbell called it, At-One-Ment with the father, provides the psychological depth and insight that makes this a classic.  You don't have to be a baseball fan to fall in love with this movie.  It's really about finding your Self, as Jung would say, or your &#34;bliss' as Campbell said, or that &#34;place where dreams come true&#34; as John Kinsella says at the end of the movie.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Songs old and new, wonderful entertainment.  A talent sadly missed by the music industry and many fans.  Great listening and more.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you like fantasy this is a terrific series and I am eagerly awaiting the next book. I would recommend it to almost everyone.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I just finished the lost city and I really enjoyed the storyline and the adventure! It was so pretty and had a relaxing feel to it. I also enjoyed how if I got stuck they have the hint section.  I was very impressed there was not ads or inapp purchases, just a fun game- I'm definitely buying the next game!
B006O6FK2W|2.0|This toy doesn't do much and the batman that comes with it can only be used in the eject function and does not fit in the pilot spot so you need to have a separate batman figure to fly the thing. My 5 year old loved it for 5 minutes and now it is just taking up space.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|- anytime, anywhere, any format. These were short stories and i liked them as much or more than the Harry Bosch novels.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I am not really a big game guy but this one is fun. Downloaded quick with no issues at all.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Great way to relax and forget the worries of the world.  Enjoy with our without your kids, we did. Enjoy
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|funny and witty.  This movie struck my fancy with the all star cast.  The writing and acting was superb while the storyline was one that caused you to think about how life takes a turn when peer pressure becomes too much.
B0028R3NCU|3.0|I was very disappointed when I first jammed my Sandisk 64GB chip inside, and needed to pry it back out with my teeth. It turns out the card is 0.85mm thick, vs the 0.75mm of a typical card. Still, this is well within the full one millimeter spec, so what gives?
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I would honestly give it only 2 stars, but, I asked my husband what he would rate it so I sort of averaged it out (no 1/2 star option). I was really never in the mood to watch a talking teddy-bear, especially one that IS TOO DIRTY to watch w my son, but I gave in the other night after he fell asleep.<br />A mildly amusing, but preposterous and completely cliched plot/sub-plot, it's best suited for well, I'm not quite sure for whom...like most comedies today, there's potential, but really misses the mark with too much cursing and silly premises...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This has been a great read for me. I always seemed to empathise with Katniss and the people she interacted with. I always want to continue reading to see what the next twist in the story is. I'm into the 3rd book in the trilogy and it feels like I only started it yesterday. Anyone who enjoys a good thriller or a human interest story will enjoy these books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am always intrigued with prison stories and those who have lived the life of an inmate.  John Grisham tells a story of a young black lawyer, wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to spend 10 years of his life in prison.  The story unfolds with interesting twists in every chapter.  I found the book  hard to put down.
B0093X805W|5.0|You see, I read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when I was in grade school and was immediately drawn to it. But when I wanted to re-visit this book, I couldn't find it at any local bookstore! So I eventually searched it on my kindle and there it was! It was just like having the actual book but more convenient.
1609611543|4.0|I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO CHECK THIS OUT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY THIS WEEK. MY SISTER TELLS ME THAT IT IS A VERY GOOD BOOK AND SHE WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love how Chbosky made Charlie write like he was writing a diary/letter to an unknown friend. It was a very interesting book and I highly recommend it.
0743297334|5.0|This is a good book about some artists (writers) after WW1 who have a lot of time on their hands. They drink and go on a trip to find some happiness. It is a look into life after WW1 about playboys or aspiring writers in Europe.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Just loved the details and inner workings of Katniss Everdeen's dialogue! The author paints a really good picture into the day to day lives while she weaves a very complicated love story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE i LIKE PLAYING SOLITAIRE. iT IS ADDICTING. i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO LIKES CARD GAMES.
0553381695|5.0|I love these books so much! They are completely unpredictable and keep me on my toes. I'm currently reading the third book, but heard the fourth and fifth weren't that great... but I will be the judge of that.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Great movie lots of action I hope there going to be a sequel it be a shame of there isn't one I think It's better then the ordinal.
B009IF7092|5.0|Love this sitcom. No matter how many times I watch they're still fresh, ingenious and funny. Keep them coming guys!
B0063IH60K|3.0|The Solitaire game is well-written and fun to play. However, the game displays various external advertising each time the Play button is clicked to deal the cards. A bit annoying. The real thing to watch out for is that many of these ads seem to be for &#34;dating&#34; services or &#34;singles&#34; clubs. Can be more than annoying if your spouse or girlfriend is a bit on the jealous side and thinks you are looking for these sites deliberately. Apparently anyone playing Solitaire is in need of help to find someone to date. I'd give it a 4 or 5 if not for the ads.
B001USHRCK|5.0|Made me feel like I was a kid again.  I have been building several of the Lego Friends and The Hobbit sets with my daughter recently but this set was a joy to build.  Yes, since the bags are not numbered and there are a lot of pieces it takes some sorting at the beginning.  But, back 20+ years ago when I was building castle sets in the 80's they didnt have number on the bags then either.
B009O2XY12|5.0|i played the easy and just enjoyed taking my time and relaxed.  it was fun and interesting to play this game
B009GED3HS|5.0|I missed many of these shows when they were out, now I realize this show is even wittier, sweet, sharp, and fast paced than I remembered it
0765325950|5.0|This book is everything that I hoped for, but I wish there were way more chapters with Mat in them.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|More challenging as you go on. It has kept me interested in playing when I have time to kill at Doctor's appointments, etc... I don't play too often at home but seems to have many levels to go.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love Big Fish games. This one is no acception :-) If starts out easy and gets progressively more complex. There are timed challenges at the end of each segment. Overall another great game from a great developer. Well worth it :-).
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This game is a lot like the first one. Challenging, addicting and a lot of fun to play. I would recommend this game for anyone to play.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|This is a great product. My girls play with this book over and over and never get sick of it. There are enough options and choices to keep their 4-year old brains happy and challenged. I also like that the vinyl sticker is hard to tear because they are both very rough with books and stickers. This has held up for 2 months, so well worth it so far.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an action filled story of survival and passion, it keeps the reader wanting to know more and it's so very hard to put down. Definitely  a must read
B005LAII8A|5.0|\\"Looper\\" is a mind-bending, time-traveling thriller written and directed by Rian Johnson. In the near future, 2044, Kansas, USA, civilization is plagued by social decay. Cities are ruled by criminal syndicates, and life tends to be socially deterministic. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man who makes a living working for local crime boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) as a \\"looper\\". Time travel hasn't' been invented yet, but it will be 30 years hence, and it will be outlawed. Organized crime uses time machines to send people whom they want killed back in time. The loopers kill them and collect a payment. One day, Joe's thirty-years-older self (Bruce Willis) is sent through the time machine. But Old Joe has no intention of being murdered. He has other plans. And that's bad news for Young Joe.<br /><br />Other than economic collapse and a few new technologies, the world of \\"Looper\\" is recognizable.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not recognizable, however. He's wearing prosthetic makeup, ostensibly to make him resemble his older self in the form of Bruce Willis. He doesn't look the least bit like Bruce Willis, but that's okay. The makeup was not for naught. At first I thought that Johnson had cast an unknown actor in the lead. His lack of references made Joe seem more real and his predicament more immediate. \\"Looper\\"'s success depends heavily on its ability to create a world that seems very plausible, almost mundane. Joe kills people in a corn field. He likes to dress like 20th century movie icons. He wants to retire to France. And he doesn't look like Joseph Gordon-Levitt.<br /><br />Time-warping, existentially confusing movies are not new, but \\"Looper\\" is especially clever and effective. It's character-driven sci-fi, reminiscent of 1970s science fiction films in that sense but more aggressive. Introverted enough to be interesting. Violent enough to be exciting. People act like people would actually act. At its most basic, this is a chase movie. Old Joe must save Young Joe to survive. Young Joe must kill Old Joe to survive. They are at cross-purposes. Bruce Willis is so much more memorable in his little character roles than he is in action movies, and here he gets to do both. Paul Dano, as Joe's best friend, and Emily Blunt make memorable contributions as well. You'll solve the mystery that Old Joe is pursuing before he does, but \\"Looper\\" is great fun.vive.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book have to start mockingjay right away. I wonder if they will make more movies?!?! I'm addicted to this series now thanks to getting my kindle for Christmas!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when choosing this book, I don't think the blurb does it justice, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how good of a book it was! It's a very fun and entertaining read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good easy read that they will not want to put down. Be prepared to be unproductive for a couple days!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so happy the new season of Downton Abbey has started.  Glad I do not need to wait to see the twists and turns ahead.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I forgot we could put games on our Kindle Fire.  BOoks have been my passion but NOW I am hooked on Solitaire! YEAH!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game is entertaining when I have nothing else to do. my mom got it for me for. a trip it entertained lethe whole time
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Christmas Lampon Vacation.  Got it quickly and the nastalogia of it priceless it;s a modern Christmas classic one that is tiereless to watch and everyone has someone to be reminded of in the family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|best book! i dont like reading it just bores me..but for some reason I cant get enough of this book!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|It was my fault I ordered this.  The case I got was for an HD...Not a regular 7&#34;. They took it back with no problems but be cautious...I much rather have Purple but had to get a pink one from another company.
1600964990|5.0|The whole family here loves mysteries and particularly Agatha Christie...the Queen of the genre. This is a splendid one for sure.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Has a virus but it still is a pretty good app. Good idea to get it this app, so I would but wouldn't recommend getting this app.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Finally we have Dredd done right.<br /><br />First, the feel of this film is far closer to the source material than anything seen before. It has a sort of gritty, almost &#34;Dirty Harry in the future&#34; feel that the Dredd comics did. And it does so without overt political posturing which is a relief - I watch movies to be entertained not lectured.<br /><br />Second, Karl Urban nails the role perfectly. He is an amazing actor - I don't think I have ever seen him just &#34;mail it in&#34;. Olivia Thirlby also does well as his rookie partner and Lena Headley gives a nice performance as MaMa - a villain worthy of the hero.<br /><br />Also noteworthy is the choice of story. While it may have been partly budget motivated, having the movie basically all be in one block gave the film focus. It was really lasered in on just a few components - the conflict between Dredd and MaMa, Anderson's evaluation and the fight of the two judges to survive. This is a welcome change from a lot of films where too much is typically going on and everything gets muddled.<br /><br />I do have one quibble though - the gore is overdone to me. The film did not need to be THIS bloody to get its plot across. It reminds me of the film &#34;Daybreakers&#34; (also an excellent film) where 99% of it is superb but they couldn't resist the temptation to overdo the gore. But, overall, I decided not to dock it a star over what is my own stylistic preference.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|where are guidelines to show how to play the game???  Bad Piggies.. all I see is fiigures flying all over<br /><br />Title:  Bad Piggies
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read in my entire life. The story behind all if it us both great and interesting. In fact, I couldn't even put the book down! Truly amazing and inspirational!!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|Love this movie! Definitely a classic. It would be interesting to see a good sequel, not like the manga, and keep them well in character.
075669812X|3.0|My son loves all things ninjago, so this was a big hit.  It drives me crazy that legos have weapons, so I'm not a fan.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I found Angry Birds to be a challenge and to keep trying to knock the buildings down in a manner that they will fall in a pattern so I could move to the next level
B00AECDDYY|4.0|couldnt stop playing and finished it in two days. had a few shutdowns with bionic in the higher levels but just restarted and worked fine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Holds your interest from the beginning.  Spell binding but would have enjoyed more closure.  Hope there will be a sequel.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read. I cried, I laughed, and I  related to the main character so well. I have read hundreds of books and I've never been so captivated by a story. I was sad half way through because I didn't want to be so close to the end. If you are hesitating please trust my review and all the other positive ones posted. This is the sweetest love story I've ever read with more twists than a mystery novel. I can't even describe how this book made me feel. Love love love
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great Buy. I did not have any of the movies on disk so this was a great solution to getting all the movies in one Stunning Box Set. I saved alot of money going this way. My opinion is this is one of if not the Best Superhero Movies to Date.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Didn't get to watch yet but over all it came in fast and packaged well. I would recommend this to anyone. I've seen the movie before abd we love it.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Childlike game that my kids love. Buildings take too long and are too expensive. You have to spend actual cash to get anywhere.
B000FC10QG|5.0|This is a great book or more precise a Business-Thriller.<br />Sometimes it is a little complex (due to the zillion names) but overall an interesting lesson about the behavior of Wall Street and all the egomaniacs in the field.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Was a good gift idea and popular with my family that I have given them to.  We had fun watching it
B006T3RM08|1.0|I have thrown away both Henge products designed for Macbook Pro and keyboard/track configs. Nice outtta the box, but quick to stop working as their tolerances just don't support the use cases.<br /><br />Never again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story keeps you involved from the first chapter. The anticipation of what will happen to the characters makes you keep reading to find out what is going to happen next.
B004S26HB2|2.0|The basics are good but overall you will not find many new or inspiring things in this book...<br />I like Kawasaki and his experience but he can do better...
B00631VJIC|5.0|Purchased as a gift and it was a great hit, just what he wanted and couldn't find in the store
B004QX07G4|1.0|Why do publishers withhold this feature on books??? I can only listen to books at work using this and it prevents me from enjoying a lot of books!!
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|I really wanted this to be a great book. My father flew B-17s in Europe, so the story hits close to home. While parts of the book are quite compelling, this book suffered from poor editing. Juxtaposing the two stories, or viewing it in flashback, would have created a much better flow and a much more engrossing story. As it was, I learned far more about Franz and far too little about Charlie than I would have liked, and never really saw how their lives changed in relationship to each other on a timeline, which I think would have made a better tale. That being said, it is interesting to read the German fight pilot story from Franz' perspective, a story I have never heard before. And the actual escort of the fighter by the jet, as well as the subsequent reunion, also makes for good reading. It just could have been so much better. I would bet the screenplay - and I would bet big money that there will be one - will flow much better.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved this game!! Worth the $1.99<br />:) I look forward to the next one. You will need to use the hint button...a lot.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Purchased as a gift and it was a great hit, just what he wanted and couldn't find in the store
B00451VH7A|2.0|Are they deliberately trying to kill 3D?  To get a 3D Blu-Ray format of this movie you have to pay for a Blu-Ray format, a Blu-Ray 3D format, and an E-Copy.  It is no wonder it costs $31.49.  And it seems to be that way across the board on most of the 3D movies worth watching.  Just give us the option to purchase what we want, a copy of the movies in Blu-Ray 3D format.  Now that the technology is up and running it doesn't cost any more to produce it in 3D than in 2D.  Enough of the BS!<br /><br />The 2 Stars rating was because of all the BS.  The movie was excellant and on its own would have been given 4 Stars.  The sound affects especially were great.  The ticking sound made by the sleet impacting the roof tops was right on.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Watched it a lot when my kids were little.  it was just as great to see it again.  We'd keep on watching it!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I got a free version of this game and I liked it a lot I just wish it had lasted longer before making me do a review. It stopped really abruptly before it got good and that kind of soured me on the whole experience.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Was a good gift idea and popular with my family that I have given them too.  Hard to find the ones your looking for in the store.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the bed books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I'm currently listening to my husband snore because of course, I couldn't put this book down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Liked this  book until the end. It was so ridiculous and not at all what  one would expect after such an underestimating read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I won't give too much away by saying that this book had me fooled almost to the end.  Wow!  This was a really fun book to read.  Totally different twist!  If you like this book try reading Blood for Oil by Michael Kelley.  [[ASIN:B00AWTIR9U Blood for Oil]]
1594203334|1.0|I cringed every time I opened the book.  Some topics especially stood out for example,  Breastfeeding is frowned upon and formula is encouraged, allowing your toddlers to fight it out at a playground, or being a stay at home mom is basically a worthless conversation at a dinner party, Wow. I know formula is okay for kids, but there are many studies that show breastfeeding is superior. I will not let my newborn child or baby cry it out. I am a proud stay-at-home mom that considers to be the life of the dinner parties. Drunkerman believes that the French way is the better way. Yet, Drunkerman seems very impressionable. She is hardly objective or wise. She was never really a parent in America, her parenting experience has only been abroad and her comparisons are based on here say.  I am a proud Mexican American stay at home mom and I desire to  integrate my children in society through individuality and creativity, Drunkerman, writes that children are not praised (and shouldn't be) and are confined to the same exact drawings in school. I desire to be an example for my children, I don't force them to be a certain way. I strongly believe children learn by example, not by being forced to say bonjour or merci. You teach them to be thankful and to be courteous everyday by how you treat those around you. Drunkerman, writes that if your child does not greet you, you are never invited back. I mean God forbid your child is SHY. I also, teach my children patience by teaching them about their surroundings, by integrating communication and dialogue and mainly understanding. Drunkerman writes that parents at playgrounds are enjoying coffee and allowing children to fight it out, how are 2 or 3 year olds going to understand without proper guidance?  If you take the time to teach them you will see that your child will gradually play independently and with confidence. This takes time and attention, but it is so rewarding to see a group of kids learning how to work together in harmony. It's called communication and education. Babies deserve parents that are attentive.  I won't always have to teach my children at the playground, I won't allows have to wake up in the middle of the night to  hug my child after a terrible nightmare or comfort my baby girl when she is teething, and lastly I won't always be a stay at home mom with spit on my shirt and yoga pants, but I can tell you that surviving as a stay at home mom, has fully prepared me for my future business ventures.  My children are learning how to trust, how to love, how to be honest, how to be integral, and let me tell you it is WORK. The American dream does in fact pay off. Raising Bebe is more like Ignoring Bebe So, no Drunkerman, I don't agree that the French have it better, I just think that you shouldn't frown on American parenting until you really do your homework.t's called communication and education.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this game because it keeps your brain engaged but is not frustrating to a point where it is not fun. Passes the time while waiting in line, at doctor's appointments, etc. =)
1932100660|5.0|This is a long but very interesting book outlining 40 years of work by T Colin Campbell, scientist.  The conclusions may be good.  Unfortunately, I'm finding it impossible to actually follow them in practice.  I'm a carnivore, face it, not a vegan.  I think he is right, but sorry, I just can't do it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR PROTECTING AND USE FOR MY KINDLE FIRE, EASY USE AND NICE TOO LOOK AT.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you already believe, this is a wonderful book because it gives you more detail of what we can yet experience.  If you don't believe, you can hardly not after reading this.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is nice and a great fit. And I love the standing option.  I would recommend it.  Got it in the purple and it looks just like the color displayed on amazon. -) .
B009JBZH54|5.0|By far the best of all the previous versions.<br /><br />Nola's vision really comes alive in the series.  This particular box set was worth the cost alone and you get the bonus of some art in the free booklet.  Overall a great purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son is 5, and he and I both love this game!  We cheer each other on with each completed level. Fun for the whole family.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I read this soon after suffering my own stroke.  It was fascinating, inspiring and kept me in a positive frame of mind.  Stroke or not, a good book for anyone to read who has any interest in the subject or family with the threat or actual occurance.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|until you realize you're using coins to win coins to use to win coins. pretty pointless. sure you win &quot;prizes&quot; but all you do with those is sell them for coins...
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This item arrived extremely quickly.<br />It was inexpensive and the product was super.<br />I was extremely pleased with the entire order.
B00AKKS278|5.0|It is one of the best book i have ever read, it is the book which has made the maximum effect on me, i being a lazy person can see a lot of changes within first few chapters and happy with it<br />its my best possession,<br />THANKS 'HAL ELROD'
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|My cousin recommended this book and I was hesitant because it's young adult novel. The story and characters are captivating and it is a fast read. There are some teen issues but you really get sucked into the underground world of shadowhunters. I am planning on buying the rest of the series.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This game is fun! It is completely different than my usual. I like the match 3 games. This requires a whole different mind set. Enjoy.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|at first it i didn't think i would like it but after i started using it it is wonderful.  I bought it to use at work because my Kindle would not stand up, so I purchased this one to try and it is great!  Would highly recomend this case to someone else
B0065NAKRO|1.0|The game would be good if it worked, but it hangs up and the play screen is only partially visible. I wish it had worked, as I enjoy playing Dominos.<br />Would not recommend this app to anyone.
B009B53LA6|5.0|It's No Doubt - what's not to like? I love the dance hall vibe. I love the acoustic version of One More Summer. Push and Shove is my overall favorite.
1451695195|3.0|I have entitled this review &#34;Colander&#34; because, as a &#34;Proof&#34; of heaven, it is full of holes.  Even allowing for the American language in which it is written (It is not quite English) there was only a very short passage that was worth reading.  I have to confess that I gave up about three quarters of the way through.  Like your writer, I was brought up an Anglican, in a keenly active medical family - and spent my life as a clergyman. I prefer to say no more.
0439023491|5.0|Once I started reading Catching Fire, I was not able to put it down. Usually I am only interested in books regarding romance; however, this book kept me intrigued from start to finish. I can't wait to see Catching Fire in theaters. I definitely recommend this book to other readers! I was very impressed how the author used figurative language throughout the book, making it very easy to imagine what is actually happening. I found the book to be slow in some areas, however it managed to speed back up, just before I thought i may lose interest. This is an easy read and would recommend this book to anyone!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good graphics and a variety of options make this a fun game to play. I would recommend it to all the Mah Jongg fans out there.
B0030B1WBM|3.0|Nice family show. The kids loved it. We watch it every Christmas time, and the kids never get tired of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down read in one day. Ready to read the last book and see what happens to Katniss and peeta
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Easier than the other Angry Birds games, but still great for younger children.  Also plays well on older Android tablets.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wasn't sure I wanted to read it, but heard so many other women reference it I thought I would.  The darker parts of it weren't as<br />&#34;bad&#34; as some had let on.  Underneath all that are very realistic and likable characters.  It has peaked my interest to want to learn more about them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great plot lines...new people involved...can't wait for next season...Should be terriric to see what happens to the group and what other characters are introduced..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story with lots of twists and turns and unpredictable really enjoyed it.  My first read of this authour and would certainly read more.  Would recommend.
B0001I561E|5.0|Product arrived before expected,It was a gift for my girlfriend she loves Aladdin and we were searching everywhere for this movie. Thank You very much !
B001FA0W5W|4.0|Taleb is clear and concise in his depiction of the total randomness of what we take as logical consequences of our actions! As usual he is a provocateur par excellence!
B001GGZK02|5.0|this album is fantastic.  I can listen to it all day long over and over and over.  Hell, my 6 year old even likes it.
B0043D2DUU|4.0|Seems to be a good book for referencing anything with C++.  If you are just learning C++ I would not recommend this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Nicholas sparks never disappoints!!! He is a genius with words and every single one of his books is brilliant!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Love this movie.  Family friendly, but on a level for slightly older children and adults.  No content unsuitable for small children.
B00AYU7BBW|5.0|This shows just gets better and better.  My only downside on this episode is that I didn't know it was a 2 parter.  I would have waited and watched both episodes together.
B00447G2PM|5.0|With fantastic footage of diverse species of all sorts of undersea life, this movie provides great 3D viewing. The narration is a little on the faint side.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|You can't talk to a person if you have a problem with the product, you have to E-mail a judge. I think This headset was like around $200 at the time. I sent an Email and several pics... Later I had to send bank statements, POP and receipts. It took forever to get resolved especially for the price of the headset. I MAY have over reacted a bit LOL, but it still took a long time to get the stupid wire... Well just see below. Its the Email chain:<br /><br />ME:<br /><br />Problem Description: I bought my wife the X41’s for Christmas. When I opened it, I noticed right away that the Transmitter Power Cable is NOT a 5v AV/USB cable. It is a micro-USB on one end and a USB on the other. The cable was sealed in the box so this has to be a manufacturer packaging error. I am VERY disappointed as this was a large gift! I have pictures, Proof of Purchase codes and receipts if you need them. Please let me know how Turtle Beach intends to rectify this problem ASAP.<br />Thank you.<br /><br />TB:<br /><br />Hi John,<br /><br />I'm very sorry to hear about this. We can easily provide you with the proper cable at no charge.<br /><br />In order to provide you with a replacement, I'll need a Proof of Purchase of your product, either in the form of an original sales receipt, an online confirmation email, or an invoice or record from some kind of customer account or credit card purchase of the product.  If you have another form of Proof of Purchase, feel free to submit it to me and I will see if it meets our internal standards of a proof of purchase.<br /><br />You can attach this Proof of Purchase to a reply to this email (preferable), or submit it through our web form.

Please make this fax as &#34;Attention:&#34; to your 8-digit case ID number, which you will find in the subject line of this email.<br /><br />Once we receive this information we willprocess approval of your claim.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Judge<br /><br />ME:<br /><br />Judge,<br /><br />It has been very frustrating over the past week knowing that the most important gift that I gave my wife is a glorified paper weight gathering dust under the Christmas tree. Enclosed I have my PNC statement, amazon's online confirmation, Amazons shipping statement, and 3 images of what is enclosed in the X41 package taken on Christmas day by me. <br /><br />If you really intend to rectify this in a timely manner, like overnight mail so that it will still be a Christmas gift and not a after new years gift (whatever that is), then I would really appreciate it if you sent it directly to our apartment so that we can play the (also very expensive) games that we wanted to use with the X41's.<br /><br />We have purchased many of Turtle Beach products in the past and we have always been very pleased. We have never given a bad online review, actually we have given nothing but outstanding reviews. This was supposed to be the perfect gift but now it has put doubt on purchasing hardware form Turtle Beach. There are other companies out there like Game Shark, Mad Catz, Sony, etc. that would love our average of $1,000+ / year business. <br /><br />Please do your best to rectify this situation ASAP.<br /><br />AFTER A WEEK WITH NO RESPONSE:<br /><br />ME:<br /><br />Judge,<br /><br />My original complaint discussed how dissatisfied I was with you company. I bought the X41's for my wife for Christmas as she is an avid online gamer. I still have not received my adapter.<br /><br />I will now relentlessly get to the bottom of this. Thank you for the motivation. I will guarantee you that I will get the ear of Mr. Bonanno in one way or another. In this day in age it is very easy to get the ears of corporate america or gaming magazines especially in your competitive market (I happen to be in marketing). I haven't even thought about message boards until just now. Please give meone more excuse to pursue this stupid cable. DO YOU REALIZE THIS IS ALL ABOUT AN $8 CORD? Why would I waste my time? Im done. Your manufacturing department, your customer relations department and your online &#34;JUDGE&#34; consumer service is non existent! My original complaint was answered on December 29th and I was promised a delivery within 2 weeks IF I LIVED IN HAWAII!!! are you kidding me!!!??? We live in PHILADELPHIA! 1.5 hours away from New York City!!!<br /><br />I expect a prompt reply. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I will make sure that everyone that has an ear knows how badly Turtle Beach has treated us. I can't believe we have given your company close to $1,000 in the past with the expectation of quality and excellence. That ASSUMPTION is now erased.<br /><br />TB:<br /><br />We are sorry about the missing item in your &#34;sealed&#34; X41 box. It must have been a mistake at the factory level. Not to worry, we will send it on Monday.<br /><br />We are sorry for this inconvenience and thank you for your understanding.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Stanley<br /><br />TurtleBeach.com<br /><br />ME:<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />I don't know if &#34;sealed&#34; was meant to be sarcastic or speculative, but I assure you it was factory sealed. I stated that it was 100% sealed in my initial E-mail (initial E-mail: &#34; When I opened it, I noticed right away that the Transmitter Power Cable is NOT a 5v AV/USB cable. It is a micro-USB on one end and a USB on the other. The cable was sealed in the box so this has to be a manufacturer packaging error.&#34;). It looked (looks) like it had to be a factory error because its even wrapped in the same black twist ties as the other cords in a tapped bag with other cords, inside a sealed hard plastic shell, inside another box!!<br /><br />I am very surprised that this is an exclusive error. The two cables are unique enough that they cannot be mistake from each other so i figured that it was a bulk messup.<br /><br />I don't know why this cable has not been sent already. We had a confirmation that our case was &#34;won&#34; and that it would be sent ASAP. No package was sent? this is all very disturbing.<br /><br />I am not sure if your staff has give you the full story here and I am very frustrated that something as small as this has come to this point. Did they show you the time stamped pictures that I took or bank statements? I wonder if it's a case of pass the buck, or your staff doesn't care about the quality of your product. I just can't wrap my head around this kind of total... Im done for now. because somehow I'm the bad guy.<br /><br />I am not some kid. I will not let this go.<br /><br />TB:<br /><br />&#34;X41 Transmitter USB Power Cable&#34; was sent on 12/30/2011 to your address. My guess is that it somehow got lost during the high season. Please confirm that this is the cable you need so we can arrange another shipment.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Stanley<br /><br />TurtleBeach.com<br /><br />Me:<br /><br />There is no need to send out another cable. We received the package today, it was postmarked January 10th (about a week after the initial complaint).<br />Thank you.<br /><br />Fun stuff. LOL. After reading this I guess I MAY have overreacted a lil bit-
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Movie is a waste of time.  Plot is predictable, and outright dumb.  Acting is so bad only Milla Jovovich fans can bare it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I absolutely love this song and I'm so happy I was able to get such a great deal on it.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I found this movie to be very slow moving. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open. Clint Eastwood was just blah.
B000ULAXCO|5.0|such a fantastic Bowie collection, felt like I was right there huddled around a radio in London - took me back in time
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I've been an Anne Rice fan since I was fourteen, having read &#34;Interview with the Vampire&#34; back in 8th grade. I have read everything that followed. Coming back to book one now that I am fifty was a real treat looking back and getting so much more from her descriptive style then I did as a youth. Can not wait to reread the rest.
B00899DR40|4.0|I couldn't Believe (hehe) I was able to purchase this for 3.99!!! My daughter was so excited and it saved me money so I could buy even more songs.
0142418471|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she was super happy with it!  She read it Christmas afternoon.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|From the very start of this book i was interested. You have no idea what is going to happen until the very end. All the way along you feel like you know how it will pan out but you dont really have any idea. I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldnt put it down!!
B007UXSPK2|2.0|It certainly has some tricky ideas, but Tom should have retired years ago. In fact, thinking back, his breakdown on Oprah's show was far more entertaining than this worn-out franchise. Had it been any other actor (except Matt) this would never have made it to Mission: Impossible 2 let alone 5!!!!! This and the BOURNE franchise are so over-hyped that Chuck Dee got a rash when he watched it. Don't- Don't believe the Hype!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have always liked Stephen King. This book was a great story. I give it 4 out of 5 on the account that there were some very bland, boring chapters.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Brilliant Play..Very Nice musical, if you like the Phantom of the Opera play I think you would like this. I LOVED IT
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Totally loved it! Def worth purchasing! Just the right amount of challenge n super addictive. Can't wait for the next one!
141659521X|5.0|Bought it for my husband.  He enjoys Vince Flynn and evidently this author has not disappointed him.  He next in line for my list of reads.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was a whim purchase as it is not even close to my normal style of reading material, BUT, it turned out to be a delight. A book written from the perspective of a dog gave the work a very pleasant departure from the norm!  A delightful read and a very pleasant departure from the &#34;norm&#34;
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Part of me wishes I never touched it, but I did and I can't unread it. I almost wish I could! I can't even write anymore, it's impossible to wrie a proper review without including my feelings and that would lead to spoilers. Amazingly heartbreaking is all I can say. Beautifully written.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|A book for teenagers not adults. Can't understand why this book has become a 'best seller'. Descirptions of it do not indicate what it is like.
B008P9M614|5.0|My husband got into house when he became the caregiver for our kids and I went to work. This was into the end of the series and he was constantly trying to figure out the entire story. He watched the entire series by New Years. He is now attempting to have me watch it. It is a shame we got into it so late since this was definantly something that we could have watched as a couple and there are few shows that strike both our attentions like that.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Truly love this CD.  She has grown so  much and her music is great. You can really understand how she feels when she sings.  A couple songs hit home to me and I will always be a great CD.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|It certainly is absorbing for those who like arcade style games (a la Tetris).  Easy to play but would be better if they would explain scoring better and more simply and let you know the object of the game.
B008XG1X18|2.0|i have not been able to sign on as every password i try is not available. so what do i do!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Nice Cars, Gun fights and a message that we are able to be the same and shouldn't judge a book by it cover. This movie was the first assignment of my art class and set the tone of excitement for the other assignments. Many racial slurs can make one uncomfortable but the banter between the characters as they are developed in the movie makes it somewhat allowable.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Aerosmith has been my favorite band since I was a teenager. They've had some fantastic songs, and they've had entire albums of stinkers (I'm looking at you, \\"Just Push Play\\").<br /><br />This is an album I just can't categorize. It's not completely terrible, but it's not very good, either. The only way I can describe it is that it's a schizophrenic mess. Sometimes it sounds like Aerosmith, sometimes it sounds like Def Leppard got Alzheimer's and tried to sing an Aerosmith song, and sometimes it sounds like Steven Tyler trying to sing Top-40 music, like something you'd hear on Kiss FM (the radio station).<br /><br />What do I mean? Well, this an album that sounds like Aerosmith... but sporadically. Some songs start out good, but then completely change in the middle of them - largely to their detriment. The album is overloaded with ballads, of which - and I am aware this is something of a minority opinion - only \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" is bearable to listen to more than once. It's nothing special, but it's a standard Aerosmith ballad like they've done at least dozen times before.<br /><br />The standout track on the album is \\"Street Jesus,\\" which sounds to me closest to their '70s rock, and it's the one song on the album that I've found myself listening to multiple times. Too bad they didn't think to make most of the album more like this one. While many folks found the 3 minute instrumental section at the end of \\"Out Go the Lights\\" unnecessary, I found it to be the only part of that song worth bothering with. You can get some 80s/90's Aerosmith rock flavor with the passable \\"Luv XXX\\" and \\"Oh Yeah,\\" which I'd liken to the Nine Lives/Get a Grip period sound. The dark-horse track is Joe Perry's \\"Freedom Fighter,\\" which is surprisingly enjoyable, although his voice is a bit weak. It's got kind of a Joe Perry Project / Done With Mirrors vibe to it.<br /><br />Any song from this album that I did NOT bother to mention in the previous two paragraphs is complete garbage.<br />\\"Beautiful\\" sounds like a rejected song from a Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears crossover... to call it music would be an insult to music. Legendary Child is self-indulgent tripe. The ballads are dull and uninspired. The second Joe Perry song, \\"Something,\\" is a train wreck.<br /><br />There's some nice guitar work here and there, even in some of the bad songs, but oh boy do you have to listen to a lot of awful noise if you want to actually hear most of it. The lyrics are pretty uninspired and cliched, even by Aerosmith standards.<br /><br />In conclusion, there are at best four and a half songs that won't make you want to rip your ears out (three and a half if you hate the radio single). It's not as awful as \\"Just Push Play\\" (but what else ever could be that bad?)... let's say it's a little better than \\"Nine Lives,\\" and not quite as good as \\"Get a Grip.\\"<br /><br />I'll give it a 2/5. If you're a fan sticking with them to the bitter end, sure, pick it up. If you're anyone else, most (though not all) of their albums are better.
B00013RC9I|5.0|Can't go wrong with Air! These guys are such a talented duo! There musicianmanship is flawless and their energy pristine!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Nail biting, edge of your seet kind of movie. Really really enjoyed it. Liam Neeson is a great actor! Highly recommend.
B0037QM8YA|4.0|A well put together film that exposes many issues with the poorer and lower class but a tear jerker. Don't watch this film if you are looking for a happy ending. Not a very good date night movie either but definantly a conversation starter and tear jerker.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 so far is the best for me, very bloody but the story gets more exciting by the minute. Best show on television!
B000000WJK|5.0|Can't go wrong with The Verve! Very soulful, touches the heart. I am always left with a craving for more!
0765325950|1.0|I have enjoyed almost all of Robert Jordan's books as well as everything I've read by Sanderson to date.  This book however has ruined the experience for me as the 900 page clunky object is simply too inconvenient.  My ebooks on my phone are with me always, open to where I last read instantly, and can go everywhere with me.  Reading as much as I do in small blasts make focusing on this book unlikely enough that I'm planning on shipping the book back.  I thought my excitement for the culmination of a series I've been reading since I was a child would be enough to make up for the convenience and ease of use I'm losing but I was wrong.  At this point, I don't know if I'll even buy the ebook when it comes out, a good online synopsis might be enough for me at this point.
0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain brings light to a subject that easily gets brushed under the rug or simply is never thought about.  The trait of being an introvert or an extrovert holds a lot of power over how each of us reacts to the world.  Cain outlines what it is like to be an introvert in a culture that prides itself - and constructs itself - on being outgoing and empowered by those that possess extrovert traits.  This is elegantly done through Cain's extensive research into the form, function and mechanics behind introversion and extroversion both supported by scientific analysis, historical and worldly insight, and empirical data taken from her personal life.  When the reader finishes this book, a greater understanding and appreciation for the introverts of this world is had.  Along with, those who are introverts, a greater understanding of the self is taken away in the form of higher self-esteem and a clearer purpose in life.<br /><br />Cain very effectively presents her findings using necessary scientific jargon yet in a way that the reader walks  away with a better understanding instead of being confused.  The diction and syntax are straight forward and easy to digest.  This works well as Cain continually presents comparisons between scientific research on introversion and extroversion and how the findings of such research are present in our culture today.  Cain uses historical allusions to strengthen the premise that many of the great thinkers, revolutionists, and successful corporate business leaders have been introverts.  When this is revealed, it may come as a surprise since the Western society praises the extrovert leader or those that possess outward enthusiasm and direct action instead of reserve and contemplation.<br /><br />Quiet is presented in four parts, each one taking a different outlook on introversion and extroversion.  Part one opens the book with how the current attraction to the extrovert came to fruition and it's place in today's society.  Part two delves into the biological characteristics of what it means to be an introvert or extrovert and whether or not it is within our control to steer away from being either of the two.  Part three examines the presence of the extrovert ideal in other cultures around the world and how and why they my differ.  Finally, part four speaks directly to the introvert and illustrates how one can live more effectively and happily under the constant pressure to conform to the extrovert ideal.<br /><br />With all of this exploration into introversion and extroversion done by an introvert author, I would like to hear feedback about this book from an extroverts perspective.  As I read the words and sorted through the research presented, it is easy for me to agree and relate as I have long ago become aware of my own introverted tendencies.  I get excited to hear Cain speak of all the positive attributes that comes with an individual that is more subdued, contemplative, and sensitive to strong stimuli.  That it is OK to take a little more time in decision making because it is in the name of thoroughness.  The discussion and research in this book make light of the introverts purpose in this world with highlights of the introvert personalities that have changed the way society operates and functions.  This is uplifting in the face of a culture that spotlights and encourages an extrovert personality, for they are the face of success and power.  Fortunately, Cain looks below the surface to find a world made up of a largely subdued picture of those that have been a success.<br /><br />All in all, Susan Cain takes the reader around the world, into the classrooms and laboratories to illustrate the power and presence of the introvert in a logical, effective manner.  The reader will gather a more comprehensive understanding of what being an introvert entails.  A look inside the cultural paradigm where the extrovert excels not only socially but in the business world, opens the door to the odious operandiof everything from classroom curriculum to office setup.  The reader should open this book with an open mind and close this book with a different picture of the world in which we live.  Those sitting in the corner of the classroom during recess with their nose in a book should no longer be ostracized, but gently lead back into the group and rewarded for their contributions...but in an oh-so quiet manner.  Thank you Susan Cain for being a voice for the introverts that rather not say anything at all.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This wasn't my favorite read, but was differently interesting. Could have moved quicker. I would hesitantly recommend it to my selected friends.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This movie was funny.  I enjoyed Horton Hears a Who more than the Lorax.  Overall it was cute and had a good message.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|These puzzles begin easily enough.  The more one solves, the harder they get.  If one really gets stuck, there are 5 free hints.  After that one must pay or find a smarter person to help. I like it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Interesting and well written - kept me looking forward to find out how things would end- A review should not force one to keep talking if not willing!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really enjoyed it since I am a scifi buff.  Mark had some real issues on Mars but managed to overcome them.  One of those books that I could not put down.
0393316041|5.0|This book is great.  I've read several books on Feynman and this had a lot of stories I'd never heard before.  I think he is one of the great minds of the century and I also think he'd be a great guy to have a cup of coffee with and get to know.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Fun to goof around with.  Any kid (any age) has played with it joyfully and laughed.  Okay, sometimes the volume needs to be turned down a bit, but otherwise....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Gets boring after a while but great for when you have nothing to do. It sucks to have to get the points for the games and to buy the games but it's not bad for frer
B006BTF2NO|5.0|I don't care about George Michael's personal life, because the music he has made is all that matters to me.  This ep contains what I believe is only the second Christmas song George Michael has ever released, including Last Christmas as WHAM!.  December Song (I Dreamed Of Christmas) has a dreamy, slightly melancholy feel to it. George Michael's vocals are flawless and take on several different qualities and nuances as his lyrics tell a story of childhood Christmas memories.  Every year I collect new Christmas music and make a &#34;mixed cd&#34;, so I bought this ep and December Song (I Dreamed Of Christmas) ended up on my 2012 Christmas compilation.  I was full of the Christmas spirit this season, but also feeling very reflective and introspective.  The resulting Christmas compilation had songs that were also dream-like and melancholy, but also serious.  By no means a traditional Christmas collection.  And then the Newtown shootings happened.  I later listened to this song and the others on the cd I created and every song struck such a deep and emotional chord.  I was able to keep my Christmas spirit alive in spite of such a horror and tragedy as the lives lost at Sandy Hook Elementary.  That's why the music is all that matters to me.  Track #2, Jingle A Musical Interlewd, is an instrumental with an electro-lounge groove and pulsing beat driving the tempo.  There are no jingle bells or other percussion that bring to mind Christmas music when listening to this song, but it is a great instrumental track.  Track #3 is a live performance of Edith & The King Pin, a song written by Joni Mitchell.  It is a mid-tempo song with flourishes of jazz and r&b as George Michael does best.  Track #4 is also a live performance of a slightly re-worked Praying For Time.  This version is basically acoustic with just a piano and George Michael.  His vocals on track #3 and #4 sound like they were recorded in a studio and not live as they were, both tracks having been recorded live at Abbey Road.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Terrible the worst Jeff Kinney book I think I've ever read in my entire life I can't believe it  got published
B006VREN86|4.0|I was duly impressed with episode 1 of the first season. A first class product. But I have a problem. When you first come to the main page for the show, it plainly states in the regular definition page that Empire is 99 cents PER episode. That certainly sounds like a great deal. Then you find out that after the first one it's minimum $2.99 an episode.  But Amazon used the word PER on it's main page for this show.<br />So, it's very misleading. In fact, it's probably illegal to use this language, because it's so misleading.<br />What does this mean? It means I'll probably go to my favorite video store and rent the first season, as it will be much cheaper than Amazon. Heck, other shows are $2.99 in high def. This is regular def at this price.<br />What a great opening for a show. It must have been over an hour....(I wasn't counting the minutes) Stunning production.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|As a family we watch this every Christmas time, and our kids are in their twenties now and still want to watch it!  Fun and funny and touching!
B0000A02U2|4.0|Animal House is a very funny movie and one of the best comedy movies ever made in movie history.  I agree with many people when you need a good or great laugh then watch this movie and enjoy yourself over and over again with everything it has to offer the fans of the movie.  Personally for myself the best or funniest scene is the gun scene with the horse in the deans office priceless.  I did take off one star because not enough special features I thought they should have much more to offer fans of the original version with little extra.  But I still give it 4 stars because of the number of laughs I have everytime I watch it and I have watched it mutiple times over the years since I first bought it.  So if you don't have this version of Animal House then look into buying it because of so many scenes that will make you gasp for air from laughing so hard.  Worth the money to buy it so look into adding it to your collection of comedical movies.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|I've seen it before and only bought it as a gift. But it arrived when I was told it would.
B008VZAJWK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Movies!  I love how so many of the shots look like artwork.  The acting is wonderful.  It's great to see a little history in movie form!
B0054N73EY|4.0|Most of the songs are good with typical Chili Pepper rifts and lyrics.  &#34;The adventures of Raindance Annie,&#34; is a prime example of that signature sound.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As a Woman, we hope to meet the right man when we go out. If course, if you are single and transitioning into real life or still in college just preparing to leave, you look and hope for that one man who has it all minus a girlfriend, wife, mistress or family. Throughout this entire book, I was completely into both characters feel the pain and joy equally. And the ending hurts too, but I understood.<br /><br />My hope is to find my Christian minus the deep dark issues and hopefully he loves r&b and some rap!<br /><br />No more toads, time for my Prince.
0810993139|4.0|My grandaughter would not put the book down.  She was in the super market reading a book. Two thumbs up.  I plan on getting the entire series.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Another great for KidRock, he never seems to disappoint, hope he'll still be the same KidRock<br />when he too turns &#34;64&#34;
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Combine his rhythem, soulful lyrics and rockin' beat and once again Bruce Springsteen's &#34;Wrecking Ball&#34; produces the typical sound we fans grown to appreciate.  Every song is top notch and deserving of Granny award consideration.
0321344758|5.0|Steve really provides good, clear, reasonable, and dare I say &#34;wise&#34; instruction for considering the people we're developing for. Thanks, Steve!
B00005JLRT|5.0|Nice item, just what we wanted. Arrived quickly too. Not a bad movie for Star Trek lovers. Fun to watch.
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this enthralling novel when it was first published, saw the TV miniseries, read it again about 10 years ago, and decided to see what I might glean from it the third time around. I was astonished at the clarity of the issues dealt with in The Thorn Birds, and how I could identify with the characters - their strengths and their flaws. The priest was not enchanting, but climbing the ecclesiastical ladder to Rome, where he did not feel fulfilled. Meggie learned her role in the priest's life, used that intuition for her family's good, and refused to kneel down to tradition. The father was endearing, but with too much heart for the rough environment. Frank, the boy who was always on the outside, came around, on his own terms. There is much to be applauded in the plot and characters, but the descriptions are also vivid and real. I did truly enjoy this and recommend it to readers who want something to think about after they close the book for the last time.
0765325950|5.0|I actually haven't read the book yet, though I plan to when the ebook comes out.  I really can't afford the cost and space of a hardcover book this size, and I am disappointed that I can't get the ebook version just yet.    However, that does not mean that I don't respect the decision of Harriet to delay a digital release of the last work of her late husband for reasons stated here: [...].  And it truly angers me that others would give this book a one-star rating because they feel slighted that they have to wait until later this spring for a ebook release.  That is absolutely unfair to Robert Jordan, his co-author Sanderson, his wife Harriet, and everyone else who helped bring this wonderful series to life even after his death.    Please be respectful to this series and its creators and don't post reviews without having read the book (and yes, I know the irony of making that plea, but I felt it too important to just leave it unsaid).    Thank you.
0307352145|5.0|We give so much wasted attention to the &#34;squeaky wheel&#34; just to shut them up; but we do it to gain the quiet that we all need to find our wisdom.  Quiet is a book for everyone.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|this movie is soooo coool, Im from venezuela and i'm looking for this movie all around the contry, then look here and there it is :D i can wait to see that
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Item as expected
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Tom Clancy's books continue to slide in quality of story line. It takes half the book just to get the &#34;hero&#34; to the point and after that it still is burdened with acronyms. Clancy and his co-writers seem to think that readers need to know every facet of the multilevel experience that is the armed forces. Enuff already!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run. It is loads of fun and addictive. The tutorial at the beginning was very helpful, as the game is very fast paced. The graphics and sound are excellent. I have noticed no bugs, the game runs smoothly and loads quickly. It is the best free game available in the app store. I would play more games from this developer. Try it, you'll like it!
B000UJ48O0|5.0|i love this series, is the best series ever, i'm looking for the complete series and i found it :D
0307346617|5.0|Thank you for the quick delivery and in person condition and 1 day earlier than expected. It is for a gift and they will be excited to have it!
B001QKSWOE|4.0|Stephanie Plum's life gets even more weird as a mysterious stranger enters her life. Great, just what she needed, another hunky guy that flirts unabashedly with her, yet manages to ignore her at the same time. I really liked this and would give it 4 1/2 stars if I knew how.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very good graphics, no adds, fun for kids and adults, good for free time,wonderful game all the way. My kids love the fact that it has all their favorite characters and there voices. Bravo Disney great job! :-)
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is a great writer who covers timely topics that are well researched.  In The Panther, he describes the current situation in Yemen and how the CIA works there.  His main character's sense of humor keeps the serious plot moving.<br />The Panther helps the reader understand the MidEast and its relationship to the U.S.
B00867GHS8|5.0|3D Version of Finding Nemo is AWESOME. Even though I've seen Nemo before, the 3D version is a whole new experience. The<br />movie arrived in a timely manner and the entire package was intact. I would recommend this to my friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Awesome! This version of Downton was great. The HD quality was superb and it's great that Amazon has this available for Instant Viewing for Prime members!
B004QX07G4|4.0|I'm a huge Ellen fan but was not sure what to expect with this book. Turns out it's like her talk show in book format. Minus the celebrity guests that is. The subject matter is very sporadic and random just as it is on her show. She continues her humorous ways the best she can through a book.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|After reading Fault in Our Stars, I had to read more by this author. This story is ravishing and the character development is intoxicating. Thank you Mr. Green
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Use this everyday.  Organizes my bills, insurances and things to do.  Love that you can make your sheets different colors and dates your latest updates.
B004MPESSY|4.0|I enjoyed seeing her get revenge!!  Ultimate revenge thriller.  Not a known cast at all (I have never seen this people before), but I still enjoyed it.  I don't usually watch stuff like this, but I still liked it.
B00A9X7X6C|5.0|It was a awesome movie. I recommend it to everyone. Great plot. Great actors. Great graphics. No part of the movie was slow. Just weird seeing joseph Gordon levit looking like b willis
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was intense and a masterpiece. If you loved the hunger games you will definitely adore this book. You're definitely in for a surprise.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Fun series didn't want to stop reading.<br /><br />Like the characters!  Can't wait for the next book in February to be released.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book has been recommended to me by countless friends, so I picked it up for my Kindle.  The beginning of the book is a little slow and, quite honestly, depressing, as it centers around the deteriorating marriage of the two primary characters.  The book juxtaposes the diary entries of Amy, the wife who goes missing in the book, and her husband Nick, who is dealing with the loss of his wife and the investigation surrounding her disappearance.  I will say that once through the initial entries about their marriage, this book takes a number of wild twists and turns that are both unexpected and entertaining.  After the first part of the book, the remaining two sections fly by and it's a book you can't put down.  That being said, I found the ending depressing and anticlimactic, and some of the details surrounding the storyline now seem unrealistic and overdone.  I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it to others, but this one certainly left me wanting more given the high expectations my peers had set.
0765325950|5.0|I started the series in 1994.  I could not have asked for a better conclusion to the series.  I am ready to start again from Book 0.
B009GESJH2|3.0|This isn't his best album, but I love Kid Rock and will listen to just about anything he puts out.  I love his diversity.  He has a wide range of music so there is something for everyone.
0385342055|1.0|I have to admit that, like many of the rest of the reviewers here, I was charmed by CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC. I liked Becky's spunk, her altruism beneath the shallow exterior, and her creative ways of getting out of her problems. And the fact is...eventually, she DID get out of her problems herself. But in subsequent books, she's become increasingly out of control. About the time I hit Shopaholic & Sister, I was beginning to feel genuinely horrified by what she was doing, especially to Luke. The constant lies, the shallowness, the me-first attitude...they didn't augur well for her becoming a mother. But there was always hope, right?<br /><br />Ummm...not so much.<br /><br />I wanted so much to like this book. I wanted Minnie to be a catalyst for Becky to look at herself and see some areas where she needed to grow. Instead, we have the Super Nanny looking at Minnie and saying there's nothing wrong with her (hello? There ISN'T?)...but her mother has an addiction. As, indeed, her mother DOES. And by this time, it's not funny anymore. It's ceased to be funny some time ago. What does Becky do? Scream out a denial, which everyone in the book proceeds to cooperate with.<br /><br />Between that and the whole disgraceful \\"christening\\" nonsense...I have any desire to see Becky or her inane life anymore. Luke is an ineffective, unmanly doormat for this woman; her family, God love 'em, \\"loves\\" her so much they don't effectively force her to grow up; and I have nothing but pity for this child. She's not cute. She's not charming. She's not showing any signs whatsoever of being a human being who can see beyond herself.<br /><br />What do you know...she's a clone of her mother.<br /><br />This series should have been over after the third book. The fact it's been milked this long--and pulling in a kid as a gimmick hoping we won't notice the rest of it's falling apart--is a disgrace. Kinsella should have had enough clout with her publisher to say, \\"Enough's enough\\" long before this. Skip it, unless you want your blood pressure to rise more than this drivel deserves!s. Skip it, unless you want your blood pressure to rise more than this drivel deserves!
B002TWWOHE|5.0|We have watched all of the episodes and seasons and are going through withdrawal. White Collar has a wonderful cast whose characters interact beautifully together. A+ for casting. Story lines are fresh and leave you wanting to see more. White Collar is more about outwitting the criminals as aposed to the  usual car chase (yadda yadda yadda). We have four other neighborhood families hooked as well.WARNING! Some people have been known to watch 5 episodes in an evening... start viewing early.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|It could be a lot better, but its not bad. I mean it sometimes gets frozen and it shuts down.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This book is complex and intriguing psychologically. It started abut slow for me but so have other books by this author. Once I was into I couldn't put it down. The characterizations are great, the cliff hanger end is just what it should be. I had the ending figured out but that didn't detract one wit from the enjoyment because the possibilities of everything in between we're so intriguing. I really enjoyed this.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Quirkily magnificent.  Definitely worth a watch.  a a a a a a a a a a a a a h!
B002L6I9Z4|2.0|This is a neat design for my greatgrandson. The camera quality is not very good even for a 3MP camera.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Just got it on my kindle fire  it is very bright on my screen even though I don't have a flashlight on my camera
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years and a fabulous. Another great book by Stephen King.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I got this game just to kill time and found I had trouble putting it down. It downloaded on my Kindle Fire HD without any complications. The graphics are beautiful. These puzzles remind me of the old wooden puzzles I played as a child. Fair warning: you will get hooked! I like how you can relax and enjoy playing then you can choose to play in challenge mode. I'm very happy I got this and can't wait for more!
0765325950|5.0|I have closure. Maybe not a complete closure, but enough to be content with. Such an amazing book set to a truely epic pace and scale, which, is exactly what this series deserved.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very exciting and erotic!  This book definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat....<br />FYI: DO NOT finish Book One without already having Book Two on hand.... Trust me!!
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Love the cast of characters in this film.  There are so many references to other science fiction flicks you may not catch them all the first time you watch it.  Love the ending(s).
B000H5TVJY|5.0|Everything went fine with the order, arrived in a timely matter, no problems. Also, the movie is great. Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves a good mind-bender.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Not your average physics simulator. Interestingly eerie, World of Goo will provide plenty of game play. Power to the Goo!
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|It is hard to keep the momentum going in a series which is basically about relationships without a bit of either ho-hum settling in or it getting maudlin and soap opera-ish.  But DOWNTON ABBEY seems to avoid those traps and deliver freshness and surprise each episode.  There is enough continuity so you can enter the Downtown world each week and feel at home, and enough novelty in characters and situations to keep it from becoming stale.<br /><br />Season 3 brims with energy.  Shirley McLaine is believable as Lord Grantham's mother-in-law from America and plays her role with dash and panache.  It would be easy to be too campy in that role, but that is avoided.  The three daughters are getting married off which fast-forwards the story-line.  You can't help but wonder what else is going to happen to the family at the beginning of the 1920's.  The costumes continue to delight.<br /><br />I love having this series in our streaming library as my sons like to watch it when they come home.  They like the historical aspects of the show.  I hope this series continues for a long time.  Great job by Julian Fellowes on the screen-writing and production of this enthralling series.  It has the right balance of humor and drama.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Not as good as the first one but had some cool stuff that was fun to watch. Needed it to complete our Marvel collection.
B009YMKL4A|5.0|It was great to get an understanding of the history of the X-men and where, why and how they started!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed the story and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie now. I loved the characters, especially Charlie. I felt I could relate to him in many ways.
0765325950|5.0|I've yet to read the novel, but this is a 5 star review to help balance the 1 star reviews from the self-entitled manchildren who don't have a modicum of patience and can't respect the wishes of the widow of the late Robert Jordan.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Who couldnt love the Jungle Book!! I grew up with it my kids and now my grandkids!! LOVE THE BEAR NECESSITIES OF LIFE!! : )
B00004YX39|5.0|When Gaucho debuted, the word was that it was too polished, overdone.  Not to me.  Every song on this album is a gem and contributes to the story. This is an album about LA culture or the lack of it: gliding down to the coast, more fog in the car than out, to get high and trade one-ups (Babylon Sisters); a man searching in vain for his flagging youth (Hey Nineteen); the dreaminess and seaminess of LA celebrity culture (Glamour Profession); the trouble that comes with mix sex and business and genders (Gaucho); the new age and Bolivian Marching Powder (Time Out of Mind); paranoia (My Rival); and finally, a child's fantasy world of war and isolation (Third World Man).  It's a powerful piece.  The arrangements and performances are flawless.  It's hard to love something so right.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is very touching. Dorothy was so nice  to the Scarecrow and the Tinman  and the Lion. She was sweet too.
0765325950|5.0|The book was fantastic. A great ending to a great series. And please think before you give a 1 star review that is not about the HARD COPY of this book.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|wondering why I have not been able to do a normal Google search with this app. It freezes my kindle and produces no search results. I removed it from kindle!!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This game is really fun. It has alot of options to keep your interest. Have always loved to play Yatzee and now can challenge myself.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn has become one of my favorite authors. Her characters are always complex with depths you see more and more as the story develops. With her books, I'm left guessing until the last chapter.
0316228532|5.0|The inhabitants of a small English village are beautifully captured with all their faults, problems,and conflicted relationships. It's impossible not to get drawn into their lives.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Everything was great. Disc was not damaged at all when it arrived. I would recommend this distributor to anyone who likes MJ.
B001NTLYKC|5.0|Great band, great recording. The sound won't rival any of the new live digital stuff, but if like Humble Pie, they are at their best here.
0316228532|1.0|I just finished JKR's first novel [[ASIN:1471316297 Casual Vacancy]]. . . it's a shame she doesn't. There are too many lose ends and no real resolution to any of the dilemmas the author created for her characters. Clearly Ms Rowling needs to learn how to end a story. While I read and enjoyed the Harry Potter series she never really ends that one either.<br />The best rating I can give this is a one. While she uses a lot of language and situations which would not be mentioned in polite company I would hardly call this an adult book. It is an unworthy product of an otherwise talented writer. Definitely a can and should miss on my adult reading list.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I thought it would be more like the musical or movie.  Something you could read, but as I looked at the table of contents I realized it was HUGE!
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|it is really fun but when you push the mushroom power it doesn't work I had to delete it then install it again
B00307OTDE|5.0|If you love Hendrix, you've probably got all this already. But it's nice to have this particular selection on hand, too for those no brainer moments.
0316743003|4.0|\\"Skunk Works\\" published in 1994 is a non-fiction account of Lockheed's then ultra top secret aircraft designing and manufacturing facility located right off the main runway of the Burbank Ca airport. This is an excellent layman's account of the difficulties in fabricating and flying state-of-the-art aircraft such as the U-2 and the Stealth Fighter. The book includes many 1 to 3-page testimonies from test pilots, military officers and government officials concerning an aircraft's peculiarities or how it's \\"spy photos\\" assisted decision makers during an event or a crisis.<br />  Having read several accounts of the \\"U-2 incident\\" and certain Stealth raids this book provided me an insight as to the capabilities and the limitations of these aircraft.<br />  I would highly recommend this book to interested readers. I was previously unaware that the U-2 was used in Viet-Nam. My only negative is the fact that it's almost 20 years old - so 4 stars. As a history from the build and design side and from the pilot's cockpit it's a great read.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I loved this read!  It was like having a sit-down w/ Ellen.  It felt like a comfy and warm friend--the best way to spend the day.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|muy entretenido a mi hija le encanta y a mi tambien low ponys son adorables crear fiends y conseguir casas para ellos
1906694141|4.0|Order this audio book for my husband.  I've read the trilogy.  I loved all 3 but the second book is my favorite.  Glad this affordably priced audiobook gave me a chance to share one of my new favorite books with my husband.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|If you're aa Sound of Music fan at all you'll simply love this set. There are so many \\"extras\\"with this set that it feels like Christmas every time you open the box.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am notoriously bad about resisting buying the premium or full versions of apps I can get for free, even if the free version is hindering its usability with its limitations. The Free Version of this app is great! So great, in fact, that it only took a few moments of tinkering with it to convince me to upgrade to the paid version. Congrats, developers- your free version did exactly what it should - it truly impressed me with its variety and customization options and made me want more! This will definitely help me sleep better. I regularly try to sleep using recordings of soothing sounds or music, only finding myself irritated with that one aggressive flute solo or that pretty little bird that is chirping way too loud. Now, I can completely customize the sound to suit my tastes and lull me to sleep. Perfect.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Good color, good sound.  I just got a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas and needed some games to put on it.  This game is fun and is just right for passing the time but not so involved that you can't put it down and come back when you have time.  I like it and I think you will too!
B005GVF95O|4.0|My two year old loves this app took her a bit to  figure it out but now works it with ease. Down side it freezes in the middle of her useing it not sure if this happens to others I'm using the app on her nabi 2
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|but there is like absolutly NO point to it. you just drop coins to push others. Really really super LAME
034580404X|4.0|Not as impressed as others were- still trying to get through the first book in the series.  Vendor got books to me in good time.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|First of all, my two yr old grandson loves it. Manny has trouble with teenage daughter, then after the continental divide, they try to find everyone. It has a good ending. We baby sat on New Year's Eve and the 10 yr. old, 8 yr. old and 5 yr. old sat glued to it, the kindle even though we have a 60  inch screen.
1594487154|5.0|Pink continues to lead the way defining the essential vocabulary for twenty-first century mastery with his latest... Pink brilliantly initiates a new \\"ABC's\\" in sales---Attunement Buoyancy and Clarity--- \\"Always Be Closing?\\" Hah!! An outdated model crushed with compelling data that takes an honest and fresh look at the truth about \\"sales\\" and how we are all much more a \\"salesman\\" than we might realize. It's official, no need to keep the plaid coat, white patent loafers with matching belt hidden in the closet anymore! I prefer to wear mine with more of a Miami Vice look my self---(that's without socks for those of you who missed out of this dynamic era in television) Pink has broken the mold of the \\"Intrinsically-Motivational/High-Self-Concept-Entrepreneurial/Free-Agent-Nation\\" again! Loaded with tons of useful and compelling information, Pink's insights once again take on what once might have been 'profound esoterica' but now is transcending its reach to the main stream with yet another set of distinctions. I love this BOOK.
0525478817|5.0|Not only is this book interesting, funny, thought-provoking, sad, all at the same time ... but John Green is a wonderful role model for kids, and shares ideas that help kids want to learn, to grow, and to make the world a better place.  This book is a wonderful teen read, but also a fantastic opportunty to see into the world of kids with cancer.  Just a fantastic book!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Although heartbreaking at times, this was a great book. The author brings you right into the past, and a deeper understanding as to what it was to be a slave. I couldn't put this book down, I read it in two very sleepless nights!
B008LH4YYC|3.0|would be much better if notes could be type on the keyboard. it's often hard to read my own scribbles.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game had great graphics and I enjoyed playing it. This game had me on the edge of my seat. Once I had started the game I couldn't put it down.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This is one of my family's favorite comedies, so when we put the VHS version in our tape player one last time, I realized it looked fuzzy and tired and decided it was time to upgrade to DVD:)  If you need a few good laughs, you have to watch Tootsie!
B008B1VYP0|3.0|kind of disappointed with this one, not as good as expected. Hope next album will be better!, good for walking anyway, good beat!
B002OFIYCA|5.0|Loads of special features and includes the Pilot Episode. If you're a fan of FRINGE, get this boxed set now!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Loved the series, and loved seeing it in my home again!  I had forgotten some of the details, so it was like watching it for the first time again...perfect!
0345525558|4.0|The sad story of Victoria, who grew up in the foster care system and doesn't know how to love or express herself, except through the old Victorian language of flowers.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was very hard to get into as it jumped too much, but in the middle it started putting things together. However, the ending was horrible. This was the first book that I have read by this author and it will probably be my last.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Great way to end a great TV show!! I downloaded this on my Kindle and it worked perfectly! :) :)
B008HK3S9K|5.0|It's cute and looks just like the picture.  I fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly, although if you had an additional case on your kindle it might not fit.  This sleeve is designed for someone that wants to keep their kindle as slim as possible, but still protect it on the go.  This is exactly what I wanted!  I can keep my kindle light and non-bulky when I hold/read it.  Then I just throw it in the case when I need to take it with me.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Quite exciting and action-packed as well as thoughtful and complex drama.  Most entertaining TV series I've seen in a while!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Eact level challenging, time consuming, you could play for hours. Addicting. Didn't think I would like this game but to my surprise I do.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show. I can't wait to get to season 2. Probably the best show out so far. Streaming quality isn't so bad either considering I ordered the non HD version. All in all I would definitely recommend this show
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I didn't expect it to actually work. but after the first few nights I listened to it, I fell asleep faster and I woke up feeling reallly good and not in the middle of the night like I used to.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|If you are a Taylor Swift fan than you will love this CD.  I bought this for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love Zooey and love her band She and Him so I might be biased but this truly is a great album.
0765325950|1.0|You would think that at this point an ebook version would just be automatic. But no. Some people feel a need to protect outmoded business models even if it means poking a finger into the eyes many fans. I wonder how long it will be before an ebook is available through other channels?
B0014JIFWG|4.0|I bout them for my son.  I thought they had air holes in them, but didn't have them.  He will have to wear socks.
B000SEVVLK|5.0|best book ever Lauren Weisberger writes my life! so relatable and down to earth her books get me through the commute to NY and back!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I received a new Kindle for Christmas and my grandchildren wanted me to download this game.  They love it!  It's challenging but easy to play.
0061703087|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  So full of suspense and intrigue.  The characters were so full and developed.  I didn't expect that from this type of book (my first Crichton read).  It was very fulfilling.<br /><br />However, it is FULL of swearing.  I black out the bad words and some pages are pretty marked up.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Had a hard time staying with the film.  Great chance to view with Prime though and that was worth the effort.
0525958002|5.0|Brought this for my wife for Christmas,and from what she has told me she is very happy with the book.She Loves Duran Duran.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I thought it was freaking awesome! It was a little cheesy at times, but I loved the cheese! It's hilarious.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Im a huge Indiana Jones fan. I love all the movies, some more than others but I love them all. I was so happy to get this box set. The picture quality jump from the previous dvd version is incredible, Raiders in particular is jaw dropping. Ive never seen these movies look this good. The special features are in depth, interesting and really well done. They kept me entertained for hours. They box set is of excellent quality all the way around, if you have the Star Wars complete saga box set it is almost exactly the same box. If you love Indiana Jones, for the price you can not pass this one up!
B005KELW26|5.0|Would have preferred a deeper violet purple but this is all they have...So I am happy<br />It stays home mostly so I can not speak to the wear of the cover. Overall it is a cover that works.
B008KW43TE|5.0|2012 was definitely a year of hip hop and r&b.  This was one of the standouts, but I'm sure you knew that.  A great concept album, full of great tunes, great ideas, and just absolute talent in Mr. Ocean.  An absolute winner in every way.  A special album.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I am having a hard time 'grasping' to this book.  Therefore, I have not gotten very far in it, but I do keep trying.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I previously had Batman Begins and The Dark Knight on dvd but wanted to upgrade to Blu Ray. Let me just say that this trilogy box set is perfect. It may not be the Ultimate Collectors edition and its not supposed to be. Its 3 great films, some special features, a nice box and a really nice booklet. And its only $30! For the price you cant go wrong! If your looking for more than what is presented here, id wait for the Ultimate Collectors edition which will probably be around $200. But I im just fine with my $30 box set.
0307730697|5.0|This is an amazing story.  You don't have to enjoy military related books to get drawn in.  I bought this book for my kindle and ended up loving it so much I bought the hardcover to give for my works White Elephant Christmas.  I was pleased when several people were talking about the book and the person whom got the book agreed to bring it back in and share it with co-workers.<br />I truly hope someday a movie is made about Adam &#34;Leroy&#34; Brown.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|People who haven't heard about Downton Abbey are really missing out. It's educational, entertaining, and I found myself sad to see each episode end. After watching season 1 in one day because I was captivated, I quickly bought season 2 because I couldn't wait for it to be released in July 2013. I watched that in two days because I didn't want it to end. By the way my husband is also hooked on Downton Abbey as well. I recommend this series to everyone. What a refreshing change from all the violence, graphic blood and guts we are forced to choose from on every channel.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is filled with everything a good book should be. Its funny, serious and romantic. I really recommend it. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Took a while to get into, but amazing book! Stayed up late 3 nights to finish it :) can't wait to start on the next one, because I am entrapped with the stories.
