B00005R87Q|5.0|I have all of them and if you miss watching  any of them from the beginning to the last you miss a lot.  They always leave you a little hint as to what is coming in the next movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|fills up screen, nice alrm, nice color, illumination could be brighter, but you can adjust if necessary, would reccommend to freinds
B0036S4B6M|3.0|A good read but really lacks a lot of the drama that I was expecting.  I found myself a little disappointed but still would recommend it.  The story tended to be a little slow but some of the relationships among the women were captured pretty well.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|great book, classic story, book was in good condition, kindle edition is better for yr eyes, dictionary helps, language is vernacular
1476734941|3.0|My husband has lost weight and so have I.  BUT you don't need the book - everything is online and you could youtube Michael Mosley and watch how he got into the fastdiet.  However, it's good to have the book around to reference back.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I anxiously waited for this book and was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype.  Don't worry it does.  A page turner with a great plot twist.  I found myself routing for these characters and actually having some sympathy for the bad guys.  Great ending.
1451695195|5.0|The Supreme Person picked the perfect person, an atheist that understands how the body functions, or doesn't, to experience the true goal of life, beyond these bodies, and return to tell the story. The Absolute Truth is not a &#34;belief system&#34; (which are temporary), He is who He is, and is approachable and can be known by all, we just have to want Him bad enough, as did Dr. Alexander when he realized that only He could help him!
B004GJXQ20|1.0|It is such an old idea, story like this has been told before, I found myself skipping pages and just so bored never finished it and glad I did not buy whole series.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Good to know additional activities are on the way.  Scenes are very complicated.  Enjoy the hidden pictures ..more challenging than many others
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! Had a great story line. Can't wait to start the last book. Best series I have read in ling time.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|Had all the old albums that you can't find in any store includes any liner notes and good quality sound.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Workmanlike, easy to follow directions, but not the simplest read ever. I was able to make it work as far as I have gotten with it. The ultimate product for Kindle self-publishers would be a downloadable word processing program that is back-compatible to Word and Open Office, but would generate text directly in Kindle format to save all that time reformatting by hand. I'd pay $25-100 US for THAT software! However, until Amazon decides to create such a product, this book does the job.
B00F9040HU|3.0|A good game, for hand and eye coordination. Surprised it was not longer in the free one. Will consider it later.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read this in four days and was very impressed - you didn't have to read the Shinning to enjoy this. It follows Dan's past very well in a great story that I fully enjoyed explaining what the 'Shinning' is and those who have it. He took a piece of the Green Mile that I thought was good as well.
1476727651|5.0|This was an excellent book and an excellent sequel to The Shining. Anyone who has read the book (and not just seen the movie) and loved it should buy and read this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so awsome I love competing with my friends on Facebook and I love the characters  especially
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Perfect price for all 3 Toy Story Blu-Rays.<br /><br />Side note, its the UK edition which so far appears exactly the same as the US editions. The blu-ray cases are a tiny bit larger than the normal ones Im used to. Theres nothing special inside them, the cases are just bigger than usual. However for 30 bucks its fine.
B000093W3A|3.0|Loved this album since the day it came out. The cd I got back in the day has seen better days, and i thought it was time to replace it on vinyl. bummer number 1: I unwrap it and notice this double l.p. is not in a gatefold sleeve. really? for $28 bucks i expect gatefold! bummer number 2: the top back edge of the record sleeve isn't fully adhered to the front of the sleeve (e.g. i have to glue it back together). shoddy. bummer number 3: the mastering for the l.p. leaves something to be desired. i hear distortion at points, and the track &#34;shine like stars&#34; distorts to the point that i can't listen to it. it pains me not to be able to hear this closing track.<br /><br />one caveat: the distortion may be due to the fact that i need a new needle. i haven't played other records to a/b screamadelica with. if it isn't the needle than i lower my grade to one star.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Received in a timely matter, put it to use right off and it works like a charm. It works a whole lot better than the built in mic on camera!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I don't care what all these wannabe reviewees think but this album is Fantastic! Deep rhythms feels like remixed Urban Hip-Hop. I'm a guy ans I just have to say her lyrics are intoxicating you cant stop listening to her fresh voice that's unique. You wont regret your purchase get the cd and you get the auto-rip. its way better then I-tunes. Anyways enjoy your purchase:)
B002DOSBMK|4.0|One thing to know....  It is without great effort one reads this work of art.  Do yourself a favor and devour it today
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I am going to keep this quick. If you love Star Trek  than this is a no-brainer. If you are into action films with a good story and are on the fence as to buy than please rent it first.<br />As far as 3d vs. regular editions I would get the 3d if and only if you really like 3d. This movie in my opinion is just ok as far as 3d goes(I am a 3d nut) :)  If you aren't than the 2d is perfectly fine and you will save money.<br /><br />Overall unless you love Star Trek and 3d than please rent it first. If you are like me and really enjoy all 3d films and want to enjoy Star Trek as a Trekkie would than this is must buy for us kind.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I was really pleased that the online price dropped so much, it was definitely worth waiting until later in the evening to get the dvd. Really good quality, and I was incredibly pleased by the special features. I wish that there had been a table of contents to let you know which dvd had which episodes/features, but I still think it was worth it.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|This is one of thee finest albums of the year.  Every track is different and good.  In fact at times you forget it is the same band because it is so diverse.  Not like Faith No More diverse where it doesn't seem to fit together but just a beautiful job by the band to put out an album that leaves you wanting more from them even with the deluxe 15 tracks.
B00913P6G0|5.0|This album is really well done. Multilayered and successful on many levels, I enjoy the beats, the rhymes, and the context. The record truly brings you into his upbringing with a slice of life from CA
B0063M22QO|4.0|This challenging game requires you to complete the game to move on to the next level in order to complete the game. Rules are easily understood. I just wish there was a Mahjong 3! The one thing I wish I could do was &quot;undo last move.&quot;
B0063M22QO|4.0|What gives ??? I just bought this game and was having fun playing it. Then in a middle of a game,it quit. Black screen-nothing. Thought it was my Kindle, not. I can play all my games, but click of Mahjong and all I get is a black screen. Very unhappy with it. All I want is to play the darn game.......
B001P06GX4|5.0|this is a fun game for four players,  for some it was fun to block their moves but it was also fun trying to get everyone to fill in as many blocks as possible.  So whether as rivals or helpers, it's a really fun game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cannot believe what I just read! I mean I looooved this book so much that I have read it 6 times, the wholes series, and I was wondering what some of the reviews would say and I could only find bad reviews at first but THEY ARE SOOOOO WRONG! THIS BOOK IS GOLD! I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS! NEVER! i HAVE READ MORE THAN 160 ROMANCE BOOKS IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS AND I CANNOT STOP TELLING YOU HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS BOOK, I EVEN CERIED WHEN THEIR STORY ENDED! I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM! I MEAN WE ALL KNOW WE PROBABLY NEVER WILL FIND A CHRISTIAN GREY IN REAL LIFE BUT IT IS NICE TO FANTASICE. i LOVED THE CHARACTERS, THE SETTINGS, THE SEX SCENES EVEYRHING! THIS IS A MUST READ!

B004LWZW2E|5.0|This Movie has the suspense of a great scare movie needed to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I haven't seen the second one yet but I have it in the planner.  this was delivered on time with no flaws.
B00005B36H|5.0|I bought this CD last year after my friend brought me on to this amazing band. Tool is not the average &#34;rock band&#34;. Tool can be viewed as progressive metal, but far from intense prog metal bands Ex: Symphony X, and Dream Theatre. Tool is more atmospheric and psychedelic. Don't misunderstand me and think that this is a soft spoken band, because they are not. They are a heavy band at some points, but never go crazy heavy.<br /><br />Lateralus is the 4th of the five studio length albums. Lateralus was brought to us in 2001, and is a defining step in the evolution of Tool's music. By that point, I mean Tool started as a hard rock band, but have cranked up each of their albums since 1993, getting heavier with each release. Lateralus is by all means a metal album, but in being a metal album it does not overlook beautiful clean parts, or Maynard's(vocalist) thought provoking poet-like lyrics.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|For anyone who has played and loved \\"Myst,\\" \\"Gravity\\" is comfortably familiar.  After six months of training, research scientist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is now on board a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope when satellite debris bullets through space and shatters their shuttle, and sends Dr. Stone flying across the empty abyss.  She is rescued by an experienced astronaut on his last mission (George Clooney), and soon she must find her way home across the vast expanse of space.<br /><br />Not much happens in \\"Gravity,\\" and there is in fact only two characters that we see alive.  Its genius lies in its details, as Dr. Stone must navigate two space stations, and solve several technical puzzles in order to get home.<br /><br />\\"Gravity\\" could survive alone as a visual spectacle, but it goes further.  The director creates an emotional universe, with Dr. Stone crossing the emotional spectrum from fear and apathy to courage and resolve in her journey across space.  And in this emotional universe the director pays as much attention to detail as in the cinematography.<br /><br />And that's why \\"Gravity\\" is such a powerful film.
1577314808|5.0|I absolutely love this book, would give it more than 5 stars if I could! This book has helped me grow as a person and really has helped me focus on the now and how in life their's no need to focus on the past or future because all we will ever have is this moment right now.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|EVERYBODY should see this movie at least once. It is an amazingly inspiring story. Any description I could give would not do it justice. You have to see it for yourself to understand.
0670026638|3.0|Shortlisted for the 2013 Booker, this tells two intertwined tales - of Nao, a Japanese schoolgirl, and of Ruth, a Canadian author of Japanese heritage. Ruth has found Nao's journal washed up on the shore and begins to obsess about finding out whether the people and events Nao discusses are true. Nao's story is of a young girl who has lived most of her life in California but has now returned to Japan and we see the society through her eyes.<br /><br />Nao's story is interesting, if bleak. Having been brought up in California, Nao is seen as an outsider by her classmates on her return to Japan. We learn of the extreme bullying she is both subjected to and participates in at school, leading her to drop out. Meantime, her suicidal father is making repeated failed attempts to end his own life, leading Nao to harbour suicidal thoughts of her own. In an effort to break this cycle, her parents send her to spend the summer with her old great-grandmother, a Zen nun, who rapidly becomes Nao's sole support and spiritual guide. While here, Nao learns the story of her great-uncle, a war-hero who died during WWII.<br /><br />Ruth's story is a dull distraction. Ruth is a writer, struggling with long-term writers block, giving Ozeki the opportunity to tell the reader, at length, how very, very tough life is for writers - even one who lives in fairly idyllic surroundings with no apparent real health or money worries and with a partner who loves and supports her. She is also in a perpetual state of existential angst and this part of the novel merely serves to interrupt and slow to a crawl the telling of Nao's tale. And to make matters worse, Ozeki introduces a quasi-mystical, quasi-quantum-mechanical element into Ruth's part that turns Nao's believable and often moving story into some kind of mystical fantasy in the end. The underlying questions that are being examined - of identity and the nature of time - are addressed with a subtlety in Nao's story that is almost destroyed by the clumsy handling of Ruth's portion of the book.<br /><br />The writing is skilful and confident for the most part and, when telling a plain tale, Ozeki writes movingly and often beautifully. Unfortunately she has attempted to be too clever in this, not just with the supernatural nonsense, but with the whole conceit of Ruth translating Nao's diary as we go along. This leads to lots of unnecessary footnotes, silly little drawings and playing with fonts, all of which merely serve to distract from the story. Ruth will translate a sentence except for one or two words, which she leaves as Japanese in the main body of the text, and then gives the translation a footnote - why? It would be understandable if she only did this with concepts which may be unfamiliar to a Western audience, but she does it for normal words - like leaving in 'zangyo' and telling us in a footnote that this means 'overtime'. The flow of reading is constantly interrupted by the need to check the bottom of the page to find out what the sentence means.<br /><br />While sometimes telling a story from different points of views adds depth, in this case unfortunately the contrast serves only to weaken the thrust and impact of the main story. Had this been a plainer telling of Nao's story alone, it would probably have got top rating from me, and overall there is enough talent on display here to mean that I may look out for more of Ozeki's work, keeping my fingers crossed she finds a way to end future books without resorting to the fantastical. But, for me, it's hard to see how this could stand in contention with either of the other Booker nominees I've read this year - Harvest or Testament of Mary. Of course, that probably means it will win...<br /><br />NB This book was provided for review by Amazon Vine UK.lumsy handling of Ruth's portion of the book.<br /><br />The writing is skilful and confident for the most part and, when telling a plain tale, Ozeki writes movingly and often beautifully.

0810993139|5.0|I read Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney. This book is about a boy in middle school who is focused on popularity. In his time, he faces a lot of challenges both in his family and at school.<br /><br />This book has a lot of sarcasm in it and a lot of clever pictures. It has all of the holidays that an average kid would have like Halloween and Christmas.<br /><br />If you are looking for a comedy about a middle school life, I would highly recommend this book for you.<br /><br />This book I personally enjoyed because each small paragraph has clever pictures to go along with it. It tells great jokes. I personally was upset when I had to stop reading.<br /><br />Carin H.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was an excellent book that was fast to read. The inclusion of the photographs that the main character talks about was a nice touch as well. They really draw you into the story.  The only thing that prevents me from giving this book five stars is originality.  As I began to think about this book the more I thought I have read a very similar story before.  That similar story is X-Men.  Miss Peregrine and professor Xavier are very similar in nature. I can't say much more then that with our ruining the story.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|I saw it yesterday in 3D and can't stop thinking about it.  Came to Amazon to be notified when the DVD is available to purchase.  Absolutely one wild ride that keep me at the edge of my seat.  Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar or at least a nomination for her character portrayal and of course George C. was awesome as the mission commander, providing incite and his brand of humor.  I will see this again x ?  Highly recommend it.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|FFVII was by far my favorite Final Fantasy, so I had to get this movie. And nothing is better than blu-ray (for now).<br />Definitely a great animated movie and a must watch for all FF fans.
1118232658|5.0|EXCELLENT! This isn't your standard &#34;here's what social media is and here's how you post on it&#34; BS book. This makes the future of social a lot more clear and focuses on concepts than bulleted guidelines. Written for the long term. This book will still be relevant in 3-5 years (which is amazing for a social media book).
B00FEX1AA2|5.0|Brilliant, spell-binding, refreshingly suspenseful and sufficiently scary...but in a different way.  A whole different spin on horror and it's about time.<br /><br />As long as Lorraine and Ed have been involved in the paranormal and investigating disturbances, we can only hope that they'll be another case that stands out and we'll be lucky enough to view film.....amazingly fabulous!
0061914177|5.0|Gary V is amazing. This book is the ultimate motivator. Opens your mind to what you CAN do and how you need to focus and go do it. Highly recommended for any entrepreneur and/or anybody who wan't to start their own business, change careers, or have a different look into &#34;working.&#34;

B005IQZB14|4.0|I've never been drawn to memoirs, but this story of redemption through nature sounded compelling, and indeed it was. I heard Cheryl Strayed on a radio talk show, discussing the book and her experience, and something about it resonated with me. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and her engaging style of writing. If the heroin part makes you squeamish like it did me, stick with it, because the story is truly a great one.
0345803493|3.0|This book was more of the same from the first one. I almost thought about not finishing the trilogy because I was bored with this one. I'm glad I didn't though because I loved the third book!

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. All types of games. Hidden object, blocks, memory and pipes. I have spent a few dollars on it, but have only bought when there was a special going on for coins and diamonds. Definitely makes you forget how much time has passed while playing it.

B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I loved this book because of the romance and the adventure.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone from 12 up
B00CTT9646|5.0|The best phaser I have seen by far. Although it does not light up or make sounds, the phaser is less a &#34;toy&#34;, and much more like a movie prop. It is much heavier than one would suspect. It is an excellent addition to any Star Trek collection.
B00ELE8D4Q|3.0|OK  - I have considerably modified my initially harsh review of Closer to the Truth after having played several times over in the privacy of my car on a road trip.<br /><br />This album really has a split personality - the first seven songs are all ultra Cher club type hits, similar to what she has done before.  All the melodic hooks we expect are there, and wow - age has not diminished Cher's voice one iota. (Although she is photoshopped to look 18 in the CD!)<br /><br />I don't think it is as unique as the Beleive album, but then what could be. Living Proof was \\"deeper\\" than this, if \\"deep\\" is a word you would use with Cher - lol.  Nevertheless the songs are good, and Lovers for Ever is a knockout. I just think the arrangements could have been a little more creative, they sound more manufactured than before. (are there any real musicians in this album?)<br /><br />The second half consists of 5 ballads and two more dance items. The latter is really filler - neither are very good. And while the ballads are good, and Cher's singing exemplary, I personally don't need that many ballads.  The best one is the last, You Haven't Seen the Last of Me, by Diane Warren. Amazing power of her voice, especially at 67.<br /><br />I also think the quality of the sound could be a lot better. I had the same complaint about Living Proof. Believe, on the other hands, still sounds very present and vivid after 15 years.<br /><br />I would rate this 3 1/2 stars overall.  Just a little more creativity on the arrangements, fewer ballads, drop tracks 12 and 13, and add another powerwhouse dance number. And better sound.  Really no excuse in this day and age.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth having.  I understand the reaction of those who are hating it - I just say give it a few more listens. On the other hand, it is not her \\"best ever\\".  I would say that is Living Proof, tho Believe will always be the most fun.
B0010T3UV6|5.0|I received these shoes on my day off and decided to wear them all day to \\"test them out\\". I kinda figured that if i tested them at home before i wore them to work i would know if they were gonna be uncomfortable. All i can say is wow! Normally im a person who hates wearing shoes, and yes i know that is bad for my back, but i would seriously reconsider after wearing these shoes. The comfort level was beyond my expectation, and i only got these to wear to work (i work front of the house at 2 different establishments). Very glad i forked out the extra money to get something worthwhile instead of another pair of the cheap walmart tred-safe!!! I may even spring for a pair for my husband who works in a kitchen!
B0009SOFFY|5.0|This listener prefers Fun House to the more well-known and celebrated Raw Power which came about 3 years later. Whether the Stooges were the world's best garage band to drift in from the '60s or the first punk band might be good late night chatter but whatever genre- or genres- can stake a claim to them they absolutely rock on this album. &#34;Down on the Street&#34; is one of the most ballsy rock songs of all time- all attitude, danger, and thundering, smoking riffs. Yowww! Even the more crazed offerings are at least exciting. The liner notes recounting of the various illicit drugs Iggy was using at the time might put some of the more off-putting moments in context. An added disc will give completists and true fans an opportunity to hear various takes and demos of the material. This is one album no rock collection should be with out.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen Kings books are all amazing!! My favorite author!! Doctor sleep will not disappoint.  This I can promise. I could hardly put it down!
B00383ZTXO|5.0|After years of hearing pieces of this album I finally broke down and purchased it. It's a tremendous assault to the senses and whether you want to label it &#34;punk&#34;, &#34;proto-punk&#34; or whatever- it rocks like nobody's business. The added disc contains a contemporary concert in Atlanta. I get the impression this was a fairly restrained Iggy from this era with only a minimum of audience banter/baiting. Certainly with every penny.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Over the years I have read many engaging books. From time to time I find a piece of literature that, regardless of genre or style, seems to grab my attention and will not let go. I knew this book was lauded as one of the \\"greats\\". Upon finishing it I now know why. This book weathers the test of time since its publication quite well. The themes that run throughout are still relevant over 25 years later. The only real comment I have is that I wish I had discovered it sooner. If you are reading this...give it a try, it may be what you've been missing.

B004XANKVO|4.0|The best thing about this bag, as I have to state at first, is the spacer between the main compartment and the secondary one. That is where my laptop charger, iPhone charger, news paper, sometimes wallet sit right in. Perfect for any quick storage that save you time open and close the zipper like forever.<br />The space between laptop compartment and the bottom is perfect, I now find myself throw the backpack anywhere, not like my old backpacks anymore, which I have Lowepro, Timburk 2 and 511.<br />Still not perfect, advertised as a pretty spacious backpack, but I struggle myself to fit stuff into the main compartment a lot. Just quite too thin to store anything thicker than 4 inches, sometimes, you need it. I have to stuff it hard to fit my 2-day clothes when I want go travel light with this baby.<br />Conclusion? Best commute backpack I have ever used. light, durable (touch it, you will understand), the special open compartment.Worth every penny but still quite spicy to me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is good but It bothers me when I push the wrong number<br />Just get it<br />There's nothing wrong about it
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent, I could watch Downton Abbey over and over again, and having it on DVD gives me the opportunity to do that.  I have season 1, 2, & 3 and I'm looking forward to season 4. Thanks to Amazon the price was great.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I've been reading the reviews and I'm seeing that people are having the same problem. When I go to log in it loads and loads and then says &quot;an error occurred, this is taking longer than it should, please try again later&quot; or something along them lines. Its annoying and I need to get ahold of someone asap and I cant because the app is not working. Please fix this asap.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a really fun app great for all ages. i enjoy it immensely it takes a little while to load at first but its worth it
0071592466|5.0|good love it  it is really useful! It is really helpful for those who want to improve speaking and writing skills quickly.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I love this movie and find it to be time-less. No matter how many times I watch it there is always a new anticipation of viewing friendships as they ought to be..an art that for the most part, we no longer have in today's society.  The acting is superb and makes the viewer feel like they truly do enjoy each other, so it becomes far more than &#34;acting&#34;.  I appreciate also the fact that my children could watch this movie with me and not hearing constant swearing and sexual overtones...much better way to deliver a message to people when their ears are not being constantly assulted by sounds from the gutter.  My only regret is that the story didn't continue into another book and movie.
1451696191|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book.  The plot was effective in keeping me wondering how it would end. The plot was more challenging than I expected as it had a number of small one liners that you had to catch to enjoy the story fully.  The author did a great job with characters development - many of the characters had significant depth.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought this was a great read. The only reason I gave it 4 star was because it started off a little slow for me. But once o got about half way I couldn't put the book down!! To me most books are somewhat predictable but not this one. It wasn't at all what I expected. In a great way.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Fast moving. Keeps me playing every evening. Love it.....my grand daughter keeps occupied at appointments. Very entertaining game. Will buy more majong games from Amazon.
1439127727|5.0|This is a book I feel everyone should read - not being a fan of our present president, I now give him some wiggle room because I now know he is the ONLY person who has the whole picture - the book is fascinating, very informative and gives such a new perspective on which of our presidents since Harry Truman have been almost invaluable to our sitting president, whomever that may be.  A must read.
B00CXQL828|5.0|This is the best new rock album I have heard in a long time. The music and lyrics are right on the money, these guys can rock! All of the tracks are really good, I have my favorites: Elevate, I'm No Angel, Time Machine, and Desire. Give it a listen all the way through.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the sleep timer option. Wish it had more choices for this option. Otherwise<br />very nice and easy to use.  Priced just right.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|It was . Playing fine. Liked all features and then just stopped playing. I push the play button and nothing. I hope it fixes itself.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|I used to dislike Hulk, but this modern version is pretty good. I would recommend it to anybody! This movie is great. I have to say that I really love it.
B005Q4CKNA|5.0|I used to dislike Captain America, but this modern version is pretty good. I would recommend it to anybody! This movie is great.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read, and I loved it.  I'm merely a teenager and found it a joy to read.<br />I purchased this book because if all the great things I heard about it, and I was pleasantly surprised, it was quite boring In the first bit, but as the story progressed I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it for readers under 13 as some concepts in the book is not suitable for some.
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|Easy and simple to use.<br />My grandkids love it! Nice to see them with something other than a video game.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|A touch screen for a Gopro is very useful. Good quality, Good shipping, this item is only for Gopro. I recommend it.
B00FEN000S|1.0|I would have given this Five stars if I was a brainless reader of comic books.  Too long.  The dialogue was boring.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|It's Annie Hall, which I didn't think could be redone. Great job by the writers, director, and cast.<br /><br />They say I need to add more, so yada, yada, yada
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What's not to love about Downton Abbey?  Great period drama, well written script, beautiful cinematography and costumes.  And how nice to be able to watch for free on Amazon Prime Video!  Can't wait for Season Four.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I gave four stars because this is a fun little time waster. I find the puzzles very simple, even on the biggest (15x15) board, and my only real complaint which is that the puzzles themselves don't look like anything. Once you complete a puzzle, it transforms into a nicely detailed object, but you'd never guess from the vaguely shaped blob - this absolutely cost a star to me.  however the controls are solid, selecting/deselecting blocks is easy (just make sure you remember if you're filling in colored squares or marking blocks to be destroyed!) and moving the puzzle around works fine. The final 'painting' where your solved puzzles combine with a background to form a complete picture is a nice touch<br /><br />If you are new to griddlers/nonograms, or just want a simple little puzzle game, this is a good one. If you are a skilled puzzle solver, this is probably too light for you. Great for free, I don't think I'd pay much for it, but only because it doesn't meet *my* desires. Your mileage may vary.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|There are some people who think only a dog can be man's best friend.  James Bowen tells a story of his cat being his very best friend and life saver.  As a fellow cat-appreciator, I believe a cat can see his \\"person\\" on the inside and understand..
B000654YS8|5.0|I really enjoyed this video of Dire Straits. I have the same CD which is great. It has everything: video of the band straight out performing, animated videos, and the group live in concert. Can't ask for much more ! It has all the hits, just like on the cd of the same name.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Written in true Tom Clancy fashion, Threat Vector is a thrilling page-turner that keeps one up into the wee small hours of the morning. Tom had a vacuum cleaner on the inner workings and hidden mechanisms of our government, especially DoD, and his artful crafting of a complex story line makes this best-seller ring true. I began reading the 800+ pages in print form but then when an overseas trip came up I put it on Kindle. Unfortunately for me I found it a nuisance to go back and forth from story line to the cast of characters listing at the book's front on Kindle. I'm back home now and avidly finishing up this fine piece of fiction. IMHO the world will sadly miss Tom Clancy; may he rest in peace.
B0055SWM08|4.0|THIS GAME IS VERY RELAXING AND RUNS VERY SMOOTHLY. LOVE THE FACT THAT IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE YOU CAN GO BACK AND START OVER. HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS  PLAYING THIS ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Having access to TED provides me with many opportunities to be stimulated by some of the most imaginative and thought provoking ideas. Ideas worth spreading.<br /><br />P.Russo
B00915G6MG|5.0|This series just keeps on getting better and better.I even went out and bought me a region free DVD Player in order to watch it here in Germany in English.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It is very well written and researched.  The subject matter is difficult to face once we approach the age of not being as mentally sharp as we once were.  Perhaps if any of us are experiencing some of the symptoms Alice did we will face the reality and speak to a medical care giver and/or those who love us.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was very helpful and comforting to me after my recent diagnosis and treatment for cancer. I no longer fear the great unknown and realize now that many physical ailments are drastically affected by our own \\"inner/self-talk\\" that comes from not following our heart and gut feelings.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Had no idea so much history happened in this year.  Bill Bryson did a great job of setting up the events and letting the reader know what happened in later years to the people he featured.<br />It should be  required reading for middle school through the college level.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I was busy at work and suddenly a heard a violin playing next to me.  I jumped to look at my co-worker, but quick realize I had hit the refresh button on Pandora.  That's how good this headphone is.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Excellent. Would recommend to anyone!<br />Good plot,characters,story.<br />Sorry  can't type 20 words on This kindle fire<br />As it does not type letters good at all.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Greatest show I've see . This show keeps you laughing! Is there really people out there in this world that act this way?  I hope so! This is a have to watch show by everyone !
B005K0HDGE|5.0|To start, I'm a fan of much of King's work, with 'It' being my favorite (in fact, two of the characters from 'It' briefly appear here). It's a long, somewhat rambling book that builds to an exciting conclusion (which I found satisfying, though I won't reveal it here).<br />However, it's in the details of 1960's America that King gets it right and I found myself not wondering about how it would end, rather, I just hoped it wouldn't end. Nobody does this kind of thing like King and it's a welcome return to form for him after (in my opinion), some lower quality work. This is not a horror book.
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|Not able to download this version - useless to me- please advise when you have Iphone version- not able to use at all
B004XKVPG6|4.0|This is a dark film. Not just in terms of the subject matter, but also the picture. It's always raining, it's always gloomy and rarely does a film project such an atmosphere of .... foreboding. However, blu ray just makes this film shine. Everything is just a little more visible and while I understand the darkness of the original, it's hugely enhanced by the improved picture quality. An essential movie that everyone should watch.<br /><br />As for the film itself, all I need to say is \\"You put Gwyneth Paltrow's WHAT? In a WHAT????\\" I never know whether to laugh, scream, or cry when I see that part.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Can' resize text on Nabi2.  Hopefully not just user error.  Now in the market for a magnifying glass for my daughter.
B005LAIHQS|3.0|I love the original Men in Black, I tried to ignore the second which just felt like it was too rushed and not that funny. I wanted to like this, I really did, but it's just not that funny. The plot feels like it was made by committee and it drags a bit. However, it's LEAGUES better than the second one and as a casual watch, it's a decent enough film. It's also great to reconnect with those great characters again.<br /><br />So, mildly disappointed, but it's OK. Some films don't need sequels.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|before using it, upgrade your chrome, i use low dpi, the performance pretty good with low dpi, no issue, very convenient, i like it
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|It's 'Bond-ey', it's 'Adele-ey', it's got bits of the Bond theme in it. It's got cheesy backing singers. It's got drama and stuff.<br />Really, the perfect Bond theme. As a song on it's own, probably a bit melodramatic, but here, it does it's job perfectly. Move over Miss Bassey, you have a contender!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So much fun, challenging and addictive. You will not want to put this game down. My daughter started playing this game with me and she really got the hang of it fast and makes her feel great with the math questions.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|If you've never seen these, I don't want to give too much away, but I liken them to watching a comic. Every scene is immaculately thought out with amazing camera angles, cracking dialog and stunning set pieces. This is a filmmaker at the height of his powers and these are important, essential films. Go get these, silly rabbit.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is well written and hard to put down.  It is a look into the evil that some people can do and the twisted mind of a very mentally ill woman and the man.
B000VI12ZS|3.0|I thought the story line was needed and very appropriate interest story about the Navaho and as always indiginous racism in the white anglo saxons- one wonders if this was not a bit overstated however in this movie.  Nicholas Cage did not perform well and his soul searching was stretched and overdone for the viewer.  More verbal Introspektion would have helped more than the continued pouty face
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fast moving and looked forward to reading it either on my kindle or iPhone.  Would recommend if looking for a fun read.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Lewis and Means were outstanding and the supporting character of Uncus and the two daughters of Munro were very well acted.
0060574216|5.0|This book is helpful for understanding relationships.  It is a good book to leave out to share with your mate.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Good movie. Well made and cast. Only complaint was the use of far too many lens flares which cause distraction at points. Otherwise, brilliant movie!
B007REV4YI|4.0|As a big fan of the Bond movies, this is now one of my favorites.  Was a great mix of old and new, superb cinematography, and the entire cast did a fantastic job.  Only problem I have with the home release is the lack of special features.
B005ZB91KY|2.0|WAY too cheesy. This movie had so many opportunities to be good, but they sacrificed those for bad jokes, puns, and cliches.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great for people who can read.  And beautiful picture and relaxing music .Just some tips,<br />Don't open chests that cost pearls to open. (They take more than you get.)<br />Don't use real money to buy pearls, algae, or sand rollers. (Not worth it,  and IF you lose your game, at east you did not spend money on it.)
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|A friend of mine introduced me to this movie, which I had never heard of and may not have been interested in based on the cover or the description.  However, this is a GREAT movie.  Watching the movie is entertaining and fun.  Fantastic understated comedic work by accomplished actors.  The movie moves well though the story and is just good the whole way through.  You could watch it with your grandma or your religious uncle and your neighborhood satanist and I am pretty sure you could all enjoy it.  It is well worth the watching!
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|My first reading of this book found me quite taken with the ideas.  Upon reflection and a second reading I realized it was, in my opinion, new-age nonsense.<br />The ideas are not profound, they are overly simplistic and incomplete for dealing with the complexities of life in western society.<br />Bottom line, it is a fun read, but not enough substance to challenge the intellectual types.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A clever and well considered novel. I enjoyed it from start to finish and have been recommending it to everyone who will listen
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|What a ride!  This pre-quel, like its earlier model is some of the best Star Trek fun I have had for years.  The casting is superb and the action is non-stop.<br />I have watched it several times and like it more each time.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|heard this was good and it sure was.  New story incredulous and funny and tragic all @the same time.  Was hooked right from the start
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I missed this film at the box office, but believe it didn't do well on the Big screen and with critics.<br />I thought it was entertaining, future oriented Sci-Fi fun.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Great read...lived up to expectations of a Follet novel, and yet somehow he still manages to deliver fresh material and keep pages turning...don't know what I'll do for books if Ken stops writing before I expire.
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|This is free, and it works. You can record in much the same way as you would on your phone's voice memo: you cannot pause, fast forward or rewind when you replay, nor can you use another kindle function while you replay. It will always start from the beginning.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Better than Star Wars version. This one doesn't freeze up and shit down on me. Thia ia a fun game to to play.
006114665X|4.0|Christopher Clark has written an interesting and scholarly work on this important subject.  It is interesting that after one hundred years, there is still so many variations on the theme of how this debacle was allowed to occur, and some of the reviews and comments on reviews are indeed interesting because so many have various theories about this.<br /><br />For me, the take away is not who caused the war.  There are numerous works on this subject and the author points out early in the book that each nation involved printed massive volumes to record the \\"facts\\" as they saw them and also to preserve their sense of being right in so destructive an event. So, even if one had three lifetimes, you could not read them all, and you likely could not come to a definitive conclusion, so why read this book? There are many good reason to enjoy this work.<br /><br />The first part of this book concerns a history of the Balkans and the author gives us an excellent summary of this area which for decades had been a part of Europe boiling with dissent, nationalist ambitions, anarchy, assassinations, duplicity... you name it.  Serbia is one particular hot spot, but there are several more, and there were two separate Balkan wars that essentially were the result of the decline of the Ottoman empire.  Turkey was \\"the sick man of Europe\\" and all the major European powers were looking to carve up the remains of what had once been a vast empire that even threatened Vienna many years ago. Serbia, the Black Hand, irredentism, the annexation of Bosnia and Herzogovina by Austria kept the pot boiling over the years.  Austria-Hungary was itself a dual monarchy with as many as a dozen nationalities ruled within its borders, and yet having its own problems largely in the Balkans.<br /><br />It is ironic that when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was murdered along with his wife in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, even the old ruler Franz Joseph,  his uncle seemed to not be that upset about it, but it wasn't before the Kaiser got involved and issued the famous \\"blank check\\" and events began to unfold.<br /><br />I do disagree with the author's premise that Europe went sleepwalking into war.  There were many actions leading up to the first shots, and any number of occurances could have prevented this war. Had A-H simply gone into Belgrade, extracted a quart of blood, hung a few terrorists and left some of the city in ruins, it likely would have been the end of it, but they procrastinated and turned out to be the most unreliable of allies to Germany, which was feeling a persecution complex of being surrounded by nations that meant to hold her back or even destroy her. So, I am not convinced of the main theme of the book, although the book is very good.<br /><br />You can find hundreds of books on this subject, but I might recommend [[ASIN:0465081851 Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy]] as well as [[ASIN:0674062108 The Russian Origins of the First World War]] for another look at this fascinating and tragic time.ore the Kaiser got involved and issued the famous \\"blank check\\" and events began to unfold.<br /><br />I do disagree with the author's premise that Europe went sleepwalking into war.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|If you live in the country and like horses this is a good app. If you hate horses and well, live nowhere near horses you'll hate this game. But I like it. It does use WiFi and has a few places where it's hard to lvl up but it's a cool app
B005MTHRAA|5.0|Maria doesn't sing with her voice in this movie. Maria sings with her eyes.<br />All the human emotions are gathered in this wonderful interpretation of a classic and are expressed with one or two simple looks by this tragic figure.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I watched just the first episode and I am hooked! Great characters, fast paced storyline. Loved it and will watch more.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Rothfuss is an excellent new writer in this genre.  I'm excited for his future books.  One of the things that both keeps me reading and yet frustrates me a bit is that he doesn't give a lot of background into his world.  The reader is pretty much dropped into the world of Kvothe and filled with strange names and places as if you were dropped onto another planet.  I've now finished the second book and I'm still half trying to figure out what the heck is going on with this world.  I suppose that's what keeps me engaged and reading but I feel just slightly lost most of the time.  But, all in all, I am now a fan of Mr. Rothfuss and will be eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, fun for any age. Link with a facebook Acct. and challenge friends. downloaded to kindle for, no problems with loading or freezing up. downside if you don't buy anything your limited to characters you can use.

B0035JRUZQ|5.0|another great western by John Wayne !!!  I've seen it A dozen times or more ,, can't get enough !!
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|I absolutely love this album. It's heavy, it's trippy, it's melodic, it's crushing, it's everything you want from KoRn. What I like about The Paradigm Shift is that it has something for every type of fan. If you're into the really heavy riffs, they're on here. If you're into the crazy electronic stuff JD has injected in recent years, that's on here, too. Don't let &#34;Never Never&#34; fool you. It's easily one of the more forgettable tracks on the album.<br /><br />One thing I must say is that Jon's lyrics and vocals are incredible this time around, miles above what he did with Korn III and The Path of Totality. Sometimes, I've got to admit, his lyrics have been a little immature from time to time. But The Paradigm Shift is a mature-sounding album all the way around, like a heavier, brighter version of the Untitled album.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: Punishment Time, Lullaby for a Sadist, Victimized<br />Documentary is informative and entertaining, though a little too amateurish from time to time.<br /><br />All in all, I can't recommend this enough. It's a very cohesive, solid album overall.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|love that this shares ideas across all areas of self improvement.  Hard to put down when my 30 minutes of time is up.  the best success book to date.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting is telling a story this time.<br />If you are disappointed about this album,<br />You maybe a rock lover,<br />since I am a new age lover,<br />I like this item and look foreward to see the musical.<br />It's a album about a story you know.<br />And it's a great story from Sting's heart and soul.<br />I really like it!

1616614609|5.0|While a bit complicated and the quickest game I have ever played takes an hour. If you can play magic the gathering you can learn netrunner. the A-Symmetric game play is very unique and allows for a wonderful play experience. the seven factions all have there own feel and style and allow for a very versatile game. I could play this game endlessly, my only complaint by tournament rules you can use upto 3 of any card and this base set only has 1 or 2 of some cards, E-bay will help you fix this as would a color copier but fantasy flight needs to relaunch this with 3 of each or a mini expansion that gives you all the cards you would need to make 3 of each.<br /><br />If buying this game and you want to get an expansion I would recommend any of the expansions other than creation and control for a first expansion. the reason is simple every expansion except creation and control contains card for every faction. creation and control contains cards for only 2 factions so you will find yourself only using 2 of the many factions and missing out on some content. Creation and control is still a very good expansion just not recommended as a first one.
B00DCRE7M0|3.0|Not really a good follow up to the last album imo. James sings in his puss voice way too much imo. Not enough prog and too much fluff. I really like band on the last one, but they seemed to have rushed this one and don't have as many good songs. Peter Wildoer is amazing and has an incredible talent for coming up with some creative drum parts, but this one seems to be lacking that same creative feel the last one had. More prog less pussification is whats needed. I wish these guys would call me up and let me produce for them, thats the real problem imo!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|What can I say except this is a great movie.  I have everything Star Trek starting w/ the original series, all the movies and I have to say...this one did not disappoint.  I really recommend this movie to all!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The best Angry Birds yet. You can't go wrong. Simply fun, fun, fun. A must have for everyone. Don't wait, get it now.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I usually read historical fiction about the Royal families, Civil War, Resistance groups during WWII, etc so this was a whole new topic for me.  I immediately was drawn into the story of the rather unusual female lead and her job helping a paralyzed patient.  It was interesting to see how the two characters grew and changed during to story.  It was a very good read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this! Wish I had better then a 1.5Mb speed so it wouldn't buffer so much! Stuck with Century Link and they don't upgrade in rural areas.
1932907009|5.0|I have many books on screenwriting. The &#34;Save the Cat!&#34; series have to be some of the best. The books focus on story structure, especially how to develop a compelling story. I still believe a screenwriter needs books on writing dialogue, but without a good story, those are worthless. So, start with the &#34;Save the Cat!&#34; series and then get book/s on screenwriting techniques and styles.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely love this book and read the whole trilogy in three days!!! I could not put it down! It worked great on the kindle!

B00F87A7HG|4.0|Excellent collection of songs. Don't Matter has a gritty punk feel while Family Tree has a real Bowie influence. The production is sharp.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I hate that the instant bingos come up but my numbers are never called....what a waste......<br />The awards should be bigger with the free games or something

B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love this band a lot so of course I am happy with the CD. It came in a timely manner and was packaged well enough to get to me safely
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|I absolutely love this little Vox Classic Rock amPlug. Perfect for that classic 70's tube drive sound. I won't get into all the nuances of the obtainable sounds it can produce, as this has been covered in other reviews.<br /><br />I was looking for something I could use on the go with a cheap practice guitar I bought for taking to work, or even just leave in my vehicle during mild weather periods. The Vox delivers. I have been using it almost daily for a few weeks now with my Epi Special guitar I bought used for $70 at GC. Also sounds great with my American Strat and my PRS SE Single Cut. I keep the Vox in the gig bag pocket with a 1/8\\" stereo cable and a pair of decent ear buds. Yes, it sounds awesome with \\"decent\\" ear buds that provide adequate bass response...no need to haul around bulky headphones. I use Skull Candy buds...they're great.<br /><br />I use the 1/8\\" cable two ways. I can plug my phone into the MP3 input jack to use my numerous Android guitar jam track apps, YouTube, or music MP3's. I also use the cable to plug into my vehicle stereo AUX input if I want to use the Vox without headphones. Sounds incredible, especially with a little tweaking of the stereo's EQ :)<br /><br />The only CONS I can think of are:<br /><br />*No reverb/delay (minor, considering the very reasonable price)<br />*MP3 input jack is very fragile<br /><br />As noted, the MP3 jack was an issue for me. The left channel went out after about a dozen uses. I strongly suggest using a stereo cable with at least one right angle plug to minimize pressure exerted on the amps input jack, especially if you sit while playing and the guitar has a bottom jack, as opposed to a front jack, like on a Strat. Amazon has promptly sent me a replacement, though. So, 5 stars to Amazon, but 4 for the Vox due to this issue.<br /><br />I'm considering the Satriani model, based on the great reviews and addition of a nice delay effect option.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Robert Glasper's Black Radio is truly an enjoyable experience. Glasper works with some well respected Hip-Hop and R&B artist to create a very fresh jazz infused music experience, that truly captivates the music soul.

B001BANK32|5.0|Kubrick's version of The Shining is one of my favorite movies of all time, but this book is worlds better.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Ronnie James Dio, but not more than a casual fan of metal in general; seems (to me) like too many bands, Sabbath included at times, are more concerned with being loud/hard/evil-sounding/etc. than with making good music. Not so w/ Heaven and Hell. Every song is a masterpiece. The overall sound of H&H is very different from the Ozzy Sabbath - almost like a slightly edgier version of what a fourth Rainbow album would've sounded like if they hadn't gone \\"pop\\". Is it the best album ever? Not sure, but it's definitely in my top 10. If you like Dio, music in general, or both, this should be in your collection! (so should Mob Rules)
B00AMPHKJM|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THE FASCINATING STORY LINES...4 STARS SHOWS IT IS WORTH BUYING!  I LIKE THE VISIONS, THE VOICE OF THE NARRATOR, THE BLACK AND WHITE TONE.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Parts of Outliers hit home for me.  I am a retired psychologist who worked with children with special needs.  I was born in November in the early post World War II years.  Typically I was the among the youngest children in my classes. Since there was more of us than in previous generation, competition was fierce.  I struggled until I became an adolescent.  With encouragement but with little tangible from my parents, first generation immigrants who needed to work instead of getting an education, I stuck it out.  It took a while but I earned my PhD, being the first in my cohort group to complete and defend my dissertation.  Thus I also liked the section on the KIPP Schools.  My son is a commercial airline pilot so the section on plane crashes and cultures became a topic of conversation between us.<br /><br />I know that not everyone will relate to Outliers to the extend that I did; however, Gladwell writes well and I recommend this and his other books without reservation.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|Once I heard this game was coming out I immediately came to the Appstore and bought it. I downloaded it and did the usual things until BAM!! It said I needed 984mbs of space to download so I deleted the old gangstar which takes up about 2 gigs and I went back on to see if I could download it but of course it says I need 863 mb to download. So I delete another 2 games that were 908 mb added together and tried again. Again it says I need more space. I deleted every game I had on my device until there was only 1 gig in storage. IT STILL DIDN'T WORKK!!!!!! To sum it all up I would highly recommend this games to anybody that decides they want to play it but make sure you have enough space. B-)
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is the season that will lock you to this Series.  Its is stylish, vastly witty, and takes what it would be like to be a &#34;different&#34; being seriously.  Think of Candid when you think of Suk because this season pulls that off.  In DVD version, there is no censorship of the nudity and frank language which is also so much fun.  Paquin is perfect with her wholesome perkiness, realistic sensuality, and &#34;girl next door with a secret&#34; that even she does not yet understand.<br /><br />One could say that the overall theme is self-discovery, highlighted with the repeated phrase, &#34;What are you?&#34; (not the &#34;who are you?&#34; or &#34;What do you do?&#34; of common conversations today).  By her answer, &#34;a waitress,&#34; she exposes society's concentration on what you do as a mistaken definition of  &#34;what we are.&#34;  But, do not be put off by that lofty analysis;  instead, just immerse yourself in the fun characters and story lines (so many).  Stop thinking this is a vampire show;  it is much more.<br /><br />Sadly, the wit and energy of the first Season was not carried on to the later ones.  Of course, if you want the full joys of this series, you must start with the first Season.  In two days, I watched all five, one after the other in order, and cant wait to see what later installments are going to do.  It is tuff to top the First, however.
0525478817|5.0|My daughter Loved it! She said it was the best book she had ever read. It's was amazing. John Green is perfect. Can't wait for the movie.
B00005JMUA|5.0|This is the second half of Quinton Taranto's &#34;pulp fiction&#34; masterpiece of revenge.<br />The movie is pulp fiction purposely in its superficial characters and clich&eacute;d story line.  However, the execution of those characters and story is so engrossing, so raw in entertainment and excitement that the viewer is riveted continuously.  Taranto's genius is his ability to get us to have strong emotional reactions to his characters and situations of story.  His dialogue alone is so intriguing, so captivating that one will enjoy the movie on that issue along with the others.<br /><br />Of course, see both parts one after the other;  just lock the doors, turn off the phone, and become immersed.  This is Hollywood movie enjoyment at its peak, vastly above the embarrassingly simplistic and boring &#34;tween's&#34; movies pumped out today to the last category of people with money to spend going to the movies.  Oh, after you come down a bit from KILL BILL, wait a few days and lock the door again to watch all of Taranto's masterworks.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was great!! I couldn't put it down!! If you've seen the movie and haven't read the book yet, you should defiantly read this book then watch the movie again.

B00979CS50|3.0|Much of this album is apparently a jam session that goes on and on.  It's like an old guitar player buddy of mine used to say years ago.  Let's come up with a good tune and run it into the ground.  I just made two of the tracks on this album go away.  I like listening to the rest.

B008FYZIVY|3.0|By any standard, Downton Abbey is a solid piece of costume drama. I enjoyed having seen these first two seasons. But I must admit that I'm a bit baffled about why it has become such a cultural phenom. The writing is good, the characters well drawn, nicely designed and shot. But it simply doesn't speak to me beyond what any competent piece of Brit costume drama would. In fact, I'm really not interested enough to see any more of the show.
8866135712|5.0|This is the 4th Planner that I have had.  I bought a leather cover last year.  The planner has just enough space for your notes, appointments, etc. and even though it isn't the smallest that they offer, it fits well into jacket pockets and easy to carry.

B004T340QY|5.0|What can I say...I love the Coen Bros.  I've watched this movie several times and I still just love it.  If you're into a good story and quirky humor, watch it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Being able to stream this show has turned me into a Shield binger.  It is a fascinating series with lots of action and edge of your seat suspense.  I like the fact that the protagonist is a man with many sides to his personality.  He's a dirty cop who solves cases and puts away bad guys.  On one hand you are appalled by what he does and on the other you cheer him on for getting the job done, however he needs to do it.  He ignores regulations and protocol on the job, he has a complicated home life - his wife is about at the end of her patience with him, he cheats on his her with one of the other cops, but he loves her and his kids and is fiercely protective of his family.  He commands a passionately loyal little group of cops who are his team, each of whom has his own quirky personality.  There is just so much going on in this show - the chief, the other cop teams are all compelling characters as well.  The Shield is often raw and violent and it's not something I'd normally choose to follow  but I love it and it's easy to see why it lasted for so many seasons.
B00ECLU346|2.0|No longer funny, please no more. The first movie was so funny, second made me blush. This one was like watching paint dry.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|Scanner worked as advertised.  I used it to scan old slides and had good results.  Some slide casings I had were cardboard and some were thin plastic.  Make sure the slide is inserted all the way or you will cut off some of your photo.  Depending on the casing thickness, some were very snug and I had to use a small needle nose plier it pull them out.  Otherwise no complaints.

159102594X|5.0|I am a fan of GOT aka Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin.  I was browsing through Amazon and just happened on The Blade Itself.  I read the reviews and thought sounds good.  I'll try it.  I am so glad I did.<br />Joe Abercrombie introduces the characters to us one at a time.  He gives us the background to them - fleshes them out so by the end of this book, you are invested in them.  You want to know more about them.  You are with them as they prepare to go on their sea voyage.  You feel the pain of loss in Logen.  Glokta is not to be pitied or hated.  He is doing the best he can.  A brilliant mind in a broken body is a force to be reckoned with.  The over-confident Jezal is broken by the love of a commoner.  He is from the rich upper class.  He cannot love Ardee.<br />Ferro, the former slave, will fight anyone to the death to keep her freedom.  Bayaz, the First of the Magi,comes out of self-imposed exile to offer his help.  And for comic relief there is Quai the inept appretice to Bayaz.<br />It is a wonderful beginig to fantastic odyssey.

0385736002|5.0|I was looking for something to read.  I have always been fascinated with Nicholas Flamel.  I saw the cover design and ordered the book.  The inside of the was is just as fascinating as the outside.  Michael Scott weaves a marvelous tale of the arcane, myth and history.  Book one introduces us to Nicholas, his wife. Perrinell, and the twins, Josh and Sophie.  John Dee makes an appearance and the action begins.  I am not the target age group for this series but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was spellbound by the story.  Where else would you meet a warrior vampiress with a Mohawk?  Or Machiavelli in Ray-bans?  Open to page one and enjoy the ride!!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Pros:<br />1) Very little explicit details are shown concerning sexual or violent events.  I'm extremely glad for this, as the Movie will provide entertainment and enthusiasm for the young children, unlike most Movies created nowadays.<br />2) Holds true to the other Star Trek Movies' time line and facts.<br />3) Almost apparently realistic effects, until the last part of the Movie.  Obviously the re-entry scene is slightly exaggerated.<br />4) Audio was pretty good, and find I didn't have to continuously turn down the sound during loud bass events.  (Maybe it's just me, I didn't analyze this much, or maybe it was due to the Amazon HD streaming?)<br />5) The movie had an unpredictable plot.  (Seemed to mock the legal scenario of, telling the whole truth or finding the rest of the story.)<br />6) Presented or confronted young viewers with ethical scenarios.<br /><br />Some things I didn't like:<br />1) The eye liner on the male actors.  (On second thought, think the male actors had more makeup on then the female actors.  Maybe the male actors required it?)

B009GIPDQS|3.0|A small town lawyer gets involved with some illegal financial operations and ends up in jail. How he gets out of jail and his  subsequent entry into the witness protection programme has the makings of a great plot as he goes on the run from the family of the criminal he helped to put in prison for the murder of a judge. Given US$150.000 and a new identity, plastic surgery and relocation the plot gradually takes a new twist. Without revealing the ending , which is good, the storyline gets to be too far-fetched, and at times is slow in the telling.Quite unlike previous Grisham novels which always seem to grip you from the beginning I found this one rather ordinary

0307742997|3.0|Like Nesbo's previous installments in his Harry Hole series this book kept me engrossed and on edge.  His serial killer who makes a snowman at the site of each murder was an intriguing plot hook for me.  The obvious red herrings that some reviewers seemed to scorn were satisfyingly complex and had their own significance for the unfolding investigation.  I had an inkling of who the killer was about half way through the book, but since I am not interested in solving fictional mysteries, preferring just to watch them unfold, I didn't mind just reading with my suspect in the back of my mind.  The usual frenetic pace of Harry's cases is present again, giving the book the typical Nesbo edginess.<br /><br />As for the main character, Harry is his normal dismal, sad, and desperate self, struggling with alcoholism and life in general.  This kind of character can become tiresome, but so far I still care about Harry.  Katrine Bratt is his new partner, after the death of Jack Halvorson in the previous book.  She is somewhat cold and enigmatic, and Harry is not sure what to make of her.  Harry's new boss Gunnar Hagen shows signs of being problematic for Harry, but like others around him he realizes that Harry Hole gets results nobody else can get.<br /><br />I liked this book . . . until the plot climax, which takes place at Harry's girlfriend's home.  Everything that happens there is too fantastical and almost silly, and thus rather spoils the entire book--hence my giving it 3 stars.  I feel like Nesbo has started trying too hard for thriller, action-packed endings, which disappoints me.<br /><br />This book reminded me of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, with a somewhat engrossing story but a plot that gets out of control and slipshod writing.  I have always liked Nesbo's writing, but in this book there was a carelessness that speaks of a hurriedness to finish the book.  One thing in particular that annoys is me is Nesbo's persistent use of too many incomplete sentences, too many fragments.  I don't understand why some authors think that adds a sense of intensity (a la Louise Penny).<br /><br />I have two other criticisms.  First, there was too much sex in this book and it was too explicit and not at all necessary.  Second, if there is some kind of metaphor related to the mold inspector's comments that \\"mold is there but you just can't see it\\" I am missing it.  If Nesbo is setting up his readers for another serial killer in this mold inspector, he has created a creepy one.<br /><br />If you are looking for more mystery series to read, check out the series reviews on my website--see my Amazon profile for the URL.any fragments.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I almost don't know how I got by before without this product.<br /><br />It suddenly becomes the simplest thing in the world to come home, and put some music through my stereo without having to leave my phone sitting on top of my media center. Being able to walk around the house (not even constrained by the limited range of Bluetooth) has been shockingly freeing. The ability to simultaneously listen to music or stream a Netflix show and continue to browse and use my phone is awesome.<br /><br />In terms of performance, I've never experienced a lost connection, dropped frame rate, or buffering issue. I have nothing to complain about, and for $35 I couldn't ask for more, and frankly there's not much else I would ask for.<br /><br />If there's one thing I'd like to see, it would definitely be iTunes/Amazon MP3 integration, so my (non-Android using friends and family) could use their phones to stream content too. Not sure how much of this not being a thing is on Google's end, and I doubt it'll ever come to fruition, but if you're already on Android, or have a Windows or Mac PC, this is by FAR the simplest and fastest (and cheapest?) way to get Netflix/music/screen sharing on your TV. Can't recommend this enough.

B001AG52AG|2.0|I've read the 'His Dark Materials' trilogy, and when the movie was announced I eagerly anticipated watching it. Then the first reviews came in and I wasn't sure. I put it off for many years, and then caught bits and pieces at friend's places and on TV. Today, I read many mentions of the book online and decided to give the movie a fair go. It was disappointing to say the least. The pacing seemed off and there was way too much information crammed in, without getting to the essence of the story. And they absolutely butchered the ending. Movies aren't the right medium for this series, IMHO. Maybe an HBO / Netflix show would be better.

It was simple, yet complex and character driven, not depending on cgi to tell a story.  I would highly recommend for anyone wanting to watch a story unfold.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Best movie saga ever and as true to the books as Hollywood is capable of. Thought it was not a good idea to split the last book into two movies but they did it and they did it well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest ! It is a great way for me to find product and ideas for all types of things I would never have thought of myself.
B00ESNE696|4.0|When I have recorded my favorite programs (The Good Wife) and the program ran previously starts late and, therefore, runs late, I miss getting my complete show and it is so frustrating.  Because I am able to see it in whole on Amazon, I save myself a lot of anger and irritation and can relax.  I love having this back up.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is an awesome show! It definatally lives up to the number one show on television. I love all of the characters.
1426308469|5.0|My son is 7 yo and loves dinosaurs. It  is the very first time that I see him finishing a chapter book. And I love that they included the phonetic pronunciation. The illustrations are gorgeous and I love the way they organized the dinosaurs (from the smallest to the biggest). I have absolutely no cons for this book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I Wish there were more things that could be cast. Netflix and Youtube are good but I want stream podcasts.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I have watched the previous seasons in the past and had started to get bored, but this season has kept me riveted.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I have read this three times over the last few years.  An insane amount of detail put into how it all falls apart.  Even if you have watched the movie - read this.  You have not and won't experience a story like this until you read this book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Many books are basically putting together fragments of a whole and this one provided some basic and simple experiements to prove to your own mind that your thoughts do indeed send out frequencies and allow you to control physical matter outside your mind.  It referenced many wellknown physicists like Einstein who originally did not embrace the idea that thoughts could cause change physical matter until the 1927 Solvay conference in Belgium where one of the topics of discussion was that experiements were not providing the same end results.<br /><br />This book caused me to investigate and pursue in more detail the idea that you are in control.  Whatever you think is what you get.  You are the director of your life.  If you read the people Pam refernces in this book it will lead you to the next piece and then the next one and so on.<br /><br />Great book.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Sanderson keeps you entertained throughout the book. It's hard to put down once you start reading. Kept me up many nights.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|While there's lots of dialog, and this is far from an action film, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the main character morph during the film. Just pay attention, and enjoy the ride!
B000JPRPAO|4.0|This was my first experience viewing a movie on a kindle.  Since then I have gotten a new kindle HD.  Will watch another movie soon.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great to watch the book come alive on the screen...All the parts were perfect fully cast and the story line did not falter.  Enjoyable!
0143120581|4.0|Every mom who has an elementary school or preschool aged child should read this book. It makes you think about what you need to do to help your child succeed. Differentiate your standards from the world's, while teaching and encouraging your child to set their own standards.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This cleans your ram quick and optimises speed. Plain and simple it speeds up your devise whenever you want it to. its perfect for me.

B00FJTYDKK|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  It was refreshing to watch a movie that had no bad language.It is very seldom that a movie can be watched with the whole family but this movie could. Thanks for offering this movie
1476727651|4.0|I've started it. I have to say it's his most brutal novel to date. While other books had children in peril, and there was SOME child abuse in The Shining (which this is the sequel to) the first 100 pages were pretty gut-wrenching and harsh...I love Mo Hayder's books, but they often contain sexual abuse and I Expect it, know it's coming. King has never Gone There...until now.<br />It's a GOOD book so far, but if you want to read it, brace yourself.<br /><br /> BTW, if you read Dr. Sleep, King's son Joe Hill wrote NOS4A2 and the two have tie-ins. I was disappointed with Steve's tie (the one I've seen so far) because it was Out of Character for Joe's Charlie Manx to have ANYTHING to do with a 'child fiddler' like Black Grandpa. Manx tortured and KILLED people who did that...
B00915G6MG|5.0|I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I watch them during lunchtime and they length works out great.  I strongly recommend if you like this series.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|one of the main reasons I joined prime was to view downtown abbey.Was surprised that season 3 is not available for free yet
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a well spun tale which keeps you turning the pages and reluctant to put the book down even to go to sleep.
0143124544|1.0|The biggest twist in the storyline with 'Me Before You' is the number of laudatory reviews featured here.<br /><br />On the whole I found it a pretty simple, predictable read. Twenty pages in and you know where the whole story is going to, and it does go in that direction. The main characters are likeable, but pretty set and just serve the plot. I skim-read the second-half of the book.<br /><br />It's set in England and written by an English author, but it felt so much like an American story for some reason. In some ways, it didn't really feel like it was set anywhere because there was atmosphere in the book apart from Will's annex.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I takes a while every time I click to go into another section of the app it lags a lot
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Like many people I feel the Shining is one of Stephen King' s scariest books. While Doctor Sleep is not as scary as the Shining, it is still a great read with some creepy parts.  I found myself flying through the pages and then, suddenly, I had finished it. I feel you really should read the Shining before this book to understand Danny's character and what's going on in his life.  I loved the characters in this book, each person placed very carefully and with a certain role to play in the story.  Overall, a great read and an excellent story for those of us who wondered what happened to little Danny Torrance.
159420229X|5.0|Love this book, have read it several times over. very well written and keeps you entertained especially for a non-fiction about memory champs!

B00FEN1C50|5.0|The visuals, the pageantry and the contention of good vs evil this movie can fry the bacon and bring it home sister!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I started a book club that's been running for 6 months now. Finally a book that everyone liked! It was a fun read, super interesting and easy to get through (even for the &#34;non-readers&#34; in our group). Great story and well told. I highly recommend it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I agree with lucysdad and why dont we have the regular instagram app since this device is supposed 2 b an android
B000XXGMRO|4.0|Great boots. Really nice looking and comfortable, but they are cut very large! I had to order a whole size smaller than my normal size.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|One of those rare books that I enjoyed reading each page and was not concerned about how it ended.  I'm still thinking about it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Im enthralled by game play but less so by mechanics. I do not enjoy certain things and giant selection spaces for areas larger than the actual area provided. Say I want to dig out a weed behind a house. It selects the house or a building several meters away. Glitches are minor compared to some aspects
B00594XOZU|2.0|I've used kik on my kindle for 4 months and it worked fine. Today it wouldn't let me see my messages or log out, so i deleted the app. When i reinstalled it, it wouldn't let me log in. I deleted the app again and reinstalled it, it's still saying &quot;This is taking longer than expected,please try again in a bit&quot;. Please fix this. Kik is my favorite app and now it won't let me Use it :(
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Critics were not kind when this film was in the theaters, but I took a chance renting it for a plane trip and am glad I did. Both Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogan did a great job working through the mother/ son situations that arose. I would recommend it.
B00EVCGUNY|5.0|Incredibly beautiful songs--this young group is amazing. Can't wait to hear where they take us next. What a voice Hannah Reid has.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent production. The Costumes, storyline, script, and acting are all amazing. We love watching this show! Amazon also has subtitles if you have any difficulty understanding the British accents.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You know it's a good book when you don't want it to be over! I would highly recommend reading this.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|There were so many stretches of credibility in this season which can only be attributed to bad writing. It's akin to a string of bad sequels to an original feature film. They inevitably undermine what came before it.<br /><br />It was interesting how in this season they conveniently skipped over the rather messy details of LaGuerta's death, jumping forward instead. None of the other detectives twigged, not even Quinn, who had his suspicions about Dexter in the past?<br /><br />Secondly, Vogel, one of the most unbelievable of all characters. Not only does she have an exceptional understanding of the criminal mind, she also has a depraved and murderous son who miraculously faked his own death, only to return to Miami craving his mother's love and acceptance at precisely the same time Vogel decides to reach out to Dexter... That's a pretty big coincidence!<br /><br />Then, Dexter mentoring Zack. Why would he risk it, after so many previous threats to his freedom? Again, yet another stretch of credibility that treats the audience as stupid. But the silliest feat came when US Marshall Clayton was killed by Saxon. Didn't he recognise Oliver Saxon, since by that time Saxon's face was already splashed all over the news, as a wanted suspect....<br /><br />Probably the only interesting aspect of the story for me was Hannah returning. That dynamic could have carried much of the season I feel. And Sean Patrick Flannery was great as Elway. But ultimately I think that by season 6 Dexter had stopped being involved storytelling and faded into pure entertainment. Season 7 made up for it in some respects, showing Dexter's vulnerability by him being under suspicion and investigated again, albeit by the less-than-likeable LaGuerta. All things considered it probably would have been better to end it after season 7, given what 8 left us with.
1444737112|4.0|Even if you're not a cat lover you will enjoy this story of a very unique relationship between a homeless cat and a down on his luck man and how their devotion to one another benefits each of them.
B00008G8M4|5.0|I Love this movie.  Will Smith is, and always has been, FABULOUS in his role...loved what they did to destroy the aliens lol
B009LDD4V4|4.0|Nicely packaged (although one of the plastic disk holders broke in transit), clean design.  I am not terribly fond of the list of disk contents being behind the disks on the front and back of the box.  I am also frustrated that, for the ONE episode with audio commentary, it does not say WHO does the audio commentary on the outside or inside of the box (giving me the impression that the box art was completed before they knew who would be doing the commentary.  I'm glad to have the episodes with captions, and I'll enjoy the extra tidbits, but there are very few &#34;extras&#34; and it seems they could provide more...maybe a commentary on 3-4 eps in the season, maybe with cast members who haven't done one before.  I am pleased with the set and glad to have it, but I'd like it to be more developed.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I found certain web sites can't be used on a mobile which was disappointing but its nice to know I don't need to load my tablet with stuff I want...I can access it here :)
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was our book club selection for October, and everyone really liked it a lot. It made for a great discussion.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik used to be amazing, but now it wont let me log in and is saying &quot;took too long please try again later&quot;. Fix it! Don't recommend this until its fixed, sorry everyone.
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|the storyline is dumb and u can't really play with it loosely. the worst game I have bought. it was $6.99 thrown away.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Now all of a sudden I can't log into my account. I thought it was because all of my kindle data got deleted and that it was only happening to me but I read the reviews and its happening to everyone else too. And the weird thing is that I have a Kindle Fire too. And when you try to log in it basically takes forever and when it's done loading then it says Login Fail: Taking a bit longer than expected try again a bit later, but when you try again later it doesn't work. Kik should fix this problem before I never use kik again because this problem is really bothering me. Other than this problem I just LOVE kik. It helps me text to all my friends even though I don't have a phone. It's also really cool how they have some already preloaded emojis and how you can send them pictures.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|If you have been following Malala Yousafzai's story in the news or if you saw her recent appearance on The Daily Show you probably know this sixteen-year-old is a true heroine.  What you may wonder is if this book, written with Christina Lamb, stands on its own as a great reading experience.  I'd say it does.  The story of how Malala's Swat Valley was taken over by Taliban extremists, how she and her whole family had to live under the de facto rule of terrorists, was chilling.  In the book we get to know her idealistic father and, a figure little written about in the news, her remarkable mother--a brave woman, religiously devout, unable to read, who lived her whole life up until recently in purdah.  We also see the beauty of the Swat Valley through Malala's eyes.<br /><br />The cause of female education, of female empowerment, may well be the great cause of our time. You will read about it in this book, but also about Malala as a human being--intellectually competitive, surprisingly in touch with certain aspects of American popular culture yet living a very different life from girls in Western societies--a patriot, a Muslim believer, and very, very brave.  It is worth reading this book just to encounter her.<br /><br />A parenthetical note--the Kindle edition has surprisingly good color photos of Malala and her family (seen on a Kindle Fire).
0553801473|5.0|I almost didnt get this book because of some coments/ratings. I finally decided to bite the bullet becuase I like this series and it was a good price. After reading it I have decided  that it is one of the best books in the series so far. Some complain that there is not plot developement. In fact you do not get much further metaplot wise than you were at the end of book 4. This did not bother me at all. I love these books for their characters, and this book is all about character developement. Bottom line if you were looking for answered questions and a nice clean tie up to the series , you probably will not like this book. If you love the characters and over all style of the story, you probably will. Though no promises
B001BANK32|5.0|Jack and Wendy take there 5 year old, Danny, with them to spend the winter in a large hotel where Jack is the off-season care taker.  Located in the mountains of Colorado, the famous hotel houses more than the guest on the register. Often chilling and sometimes terrifying, I couldn't put it down.  Excellent characters, plot and writing.  Love it!<br />I never really planned to read this one after seeing the movie, but I decided to before reading \\"Doctor Sleep\\". The only things the book and movie have in common are the title and the hotel.  That's about it.  There's so much more in the book.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|It is one of the few books which I was unable to finish.  I finally surrendered half way through after struggling to find any logical thread to the author's rambelings.  No sympathetic characters.  Sheer tedium.
B008602KQI|5.0|almost as good as the book, arrived promptly plays well so no problems, we are content with it and have watched it more than once
B009A87X80|5.0|This is an absolute belter of a cd , with much thought given to the running order. It is rare for me to actually like the running order and here is one that seems to work very well with the variety of styles complementing one another. Eva was not a technical vocalist but rather a deeply emotional one with a very clear natural voice and she sang with soul. I can sit back and play from beginning to end no problem and I wouldn't have thought that possible having read the track list. I didn't appreciate how good she was until I stuck this on. Middle of the road ? , yes, but that can sometimes be dangerous :)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This novel is for young adults, but it will definitely keep your attention. It is the story of teens who have cancer, and how they deal with their illness, and the realization that we are all mortal.  It is narrated by a sixteen year old girl named Hazel, who has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, although she is in remission. The language used is extremely mature, and knowledgeable.  Part of this is due to her illness, part of it because she is an avid reader, and this come shinning through.  Realistic?  Probably not, but is, after all, fiction.  You will laugh at some of her adventures with her friends, and there will be some crying too. All in all, it is a good read.
4883191028|1.0|Minna no nihongo is badly organised and overpriced. I'll explain:<br />The first thing you have to know is that it's actually two books. This book I'm reviewing is basically a book full of exercises written in Japanese. There also exists a grammatical notes and explanations book which is similarly priced. It includes things like explanations of grammar, vocabulary lists, basically everything you would expect a language textbook to have. So you have to buy two books to actually learn from Minna No Nihongo. Navigating two textbooks instead of one (like Genki for instance) is an exercise in frustration. Makes me think they just wanted to charge people double.<br />The second thing is the way this book treats the dictionary or u-form of Japanese verbs and that is basically as an afterthought. Many books introduce verbs in their dictionary form, which is super important, and then teach you how to convert that into polite or negative or whatever. Minna no Nihongo introduces the polite form and does not even mention the dictionary form until very late in the book. So you don't even know it exists the first time you see Japanese verbs. This is not a good way to teach Japanese.<br />I have taken intro to Japanese twice; once with Genki in 2003 and again last year when I decided to restart learning Japanese. We used Minna no Nihongo in my class at uni and while the teacher was good, since she had to follow the book, we didn't learn about plain form or te form in our first semester (first 10 lessons of Minna no Nihongo). On the other hand Genki manages to teach about polite, plain and te form (at least the basics) in the first 6 lessons.<br />If you want to learn Japanese grammar well, try Tae Kim's guide. For verbs a good book is Tim R Matheson's Japanese Verbs Saying What You Mean. Genki is a good all around textbook that has grammar explanations, vocab lists, kanji practice (another thing MnN lacks) and tons of exercises in one well organised book. Minna no Nihongo is lacking by comparison.
034580709X|5.0|Harry is a quirky character loved the story line. Love how he writes just like the book is talking to you. I read a lot always looking for new authors. I enjoy a author that stories and dialogue flows smooth. Some times even if its a great story line, if the dialogue itn't smooth, spend to much time re-reading to understand. This author does not have that problem. After I read bat ordered Red Breast, Nemesis, since Cockroach is not available here yet........Very good read, very good story line. Highly recommend.
B008OD38JK|5.0|If you are reading this, you are probably already aware of the brilliance of the Zimmer/Newton Howard scores for the Dark Knight Trilogy. Each one presents a beautiful score, evoking images and favorite scenes from the films while providing inspiration to even the most amateur musicians and composers. Too many of Hollywood's film scores in the last decade owe their existance to these works. But you probably already knew that, so let's move on.<br /><br />This particular CD is a collection of hilights from all three scores, performed by one of the many small-time recording orchestras popping up these days. London Music Works is one of the rare orchestras that actually puts effort and passion into their interpretations - and make no mistake, these are intrepretations. While, at timees it may feel like you are listening to the original scores, subtle nuances in tempo, instrumentation, and dynamics provide the listener with a wholely unique approach to these songs. Contributions by the equally talented City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra accentuate this album. For me, the hilights of this particular album were \\"Why So Serious?\\" (which allows you to hear what a normal orchestra could do with this rather than Zimmer's electronically-enhanced orchestra), \\"A Watchful Guardian\\" (which is a track that does not appear on the original \\"Dark Knight\\" soundtrack but rather on the 2-disc special edition, making it a unique choice), and \\"Imagine The Fire\\" and \\"Rise\\" (both of which have obvious differences from their original versions, making them unique approaches to these songs).<br /><br />Several other reviewers are asking why you would buy this album when the original soundtracks are so readily available. The answer is simple: Just like a fan of Mozart or Beethoven's might have a favorite recording of their favorite symphony, they probably own other interpretations, allowing them, as a listener, to fully explore the possibilities of the work. Film scores are, in my opinion, the symphonies of the contemporary age. If someone is willing to offer you a new interpretation of your favorite work, and you are willing to explore the possibilities offered by that intrepretation, then do so. At the very least, it will allow you to better understand what you loved about the original recordings by Zimmer/Newton Howard. Or maybe, in these troubled economic times, you want to save a penny or two - this is a worthy supplement to those soundtracks (though I would still suggest you start saving to buy the originals). Either way, this is an affordable way to further enjoy some of the best symphonic work in the past decade.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This is one of Linkin Park's best cds ever. The song's are amazing. My favorites are Powerless, Castle of Glass and Skin to Bone. If you like the band, you'll LOVE this cd.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Eastwood's unique touch is all over this story of three boys who grew up together but whose lives took completely different paths.  Sean Penn is incredible in his academy aware winning performance.  This one is a keeper.

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Big AB fan here. Nothing against ABIII, but there is no comparison! This rocks really hard! This album has been so much fun to listen to. All i can say is you better have a jamming stereo ready for this one. I can agree with all of the great reviews also. Seems like they really went for it on this one. So much to say about this album. Most of all it has been a treat to listen to. What a great rock album this is! Can't wait to hear theses songs live. Heavy as hell, and Myles has some superb vocal moments as well. Thanks guys.<br />Way to go AB!
B000YABS8E|5.0|This is my most favorite comedy of all time.  I never get tired of seeing it again every couple of years as it just doesn't change.  You always get it -- no matter what's going on the the world at that time.  Very clever story and presentation!

B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is a very fun puzzle type game! Very addictive, once you get the hang of it. Really bright, colorful &amp; good graphics.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|I saw this in the theater. Horrific!!<br />Felt like forever - for them to shock and disgust me. :(<br />Never knew what 'water-boarding' was until I saw this movie - it's not so bad - compared to what terrorists to do us. - But it doesn't take that long to summarize.<br />If you like constant swearing - and violence - you'll probably love this movie.<br />Me?? - I'd like to have my time and money back.<br />I almost said 'You'd have to pay me to watch this piece of crap again -<br />- But - even I - am Not open to that!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Awesome game. Very simple idea...matching, but the graphics &amp; interaction makes it so much more entertaining than any other matching game. You just have to try it. One of my faves!
B007T7MIR0|4.0|Useful app for my Kindle!<br />Helps me have easy access  to my Google Drive and other accounts.<br />Great for organizing and having the option to use my kindle for more than just reading.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great time waster, but I'm not exactly sure what all the fuss is about. It's got wonderful graphics, but basically, all you're doing is running like crazy. I guess if you're a fan of fast paced games like Sonic the Hedgehog, then you'll like this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|wife loved the characters, the dialogue, the way Brits get their point across with so few words. The writers of this show are masterful. We enjoyed all 3 seasons very much and look forward to season 4.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great series! if only it would air again on TV. But that won't happen simply because the cast has other options for them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The Gone Girl started out well and then began to fizzle a quarter of the way into the story.  The relationship between Nick and Amy was simply not plausible.  The few characters that showed promise, such as the female cop, never fully developed and were cut short.  Although this title was a quick read I was questioning if I should read it to its conclusion.  My rating fluctuated somewhere between it's okay and I didn't like it.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|I cannot even begin to describe how I feel about this book.  Gripping!  I kept asking myself \\"what would I have done\\".  Just read it.

6305428042|5.0|Its a great movie. As old as this movie is, it still holds its own to this day. The Disney movies are always good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get it because I like it and you should to I can't believe<br />That some people deleted it that is weird right
B005LAII80|1.0|The movie is ok. Maybe 3 stars.<br />The 1 star is for this packaging.<br />Notice it's only one disk even though it's both 3D and regular Blu-ray.<br />I don't know about the 3D, but the regular Blu-ray did not play correctly because they squashed both versions on one disk instead of including two disks.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Quite the movie with alot of action and a good story line as well. Recommend it to anyone interested in action films and that love Brad Pitt.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Enjoyed playing this game I just wish it had more levels. Hate that you have to wait for more. All in all a good game.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Love love love it - watched it 4 times and I've never watched a movie four times.  Well worth the watch.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|extremely addicting! i absolutely love it and the character likenesses as well as the humorous theme and noises the birds make allow for plenty of laughs and fun. A must have for angry birds fans and star wars fans alike!
B00D7NWTSI|3.0|I was disappointed that it wasn't like the first 2, but what can you expect.  My family loves it, I just didn't like it didn't seem Downey gave it his all.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Anime is beautiful, songs are catchy, but wish there were voice over dialogue. The story is captivating and would have made a great short film.  You can only imagine what characters are saying. My husband is a big Robotech fan and apparently the animation came from same production company so he requested to see this musical. He found an excerpt from YouTube after watching Daft Punk and Pharrell video &#34;Get Lucky&#34;.

Furthermore, it has brought me to understand myself and this whole process in a new way.  Well worth buying and reading and keeping.  I plan to give one to each of my children.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is an amazing book that keeps you at the edge  of your seat the whole time!!! Good night cheese....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter loves this game. she spends forever playing it. I recommend this games to any one who has a horse lover in the family
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The author details material in references that cannot be verified as absolute true historical records of the life of the prophet Jesus(pbuh).<br /><br />In Islam, the Quran details the life the prophets, especially the prophets Moses(pbuh) and Jesus(pbuh). A whole chapter is (Mariam) -- the virgin Mary. Believers  consider the historical records in the Quran as a verified truth for the Quran is the word of God as directly conveyed through the angel Gabrial to the prophet Mohamed.<br /><br />Any other references may to be  verified and qualified through cross referencing to establish a comfort level with the historical records that may seem questionable.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I first read this book many years ago and was moved to order it recently on my kindle when it came up in a discussion. And I am glad I did. It is such a powerful testimony to Frankl's  powers of observation and resilience in the terrible time in a Nazi prison. And it is inspiring to learn about  his intelligent and emotional acceptance of his life afterward. An unforgettable reading experience!
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire. It makes locating and accessing downloads quick and easy. I am certain it will be helpful and useful as I continue to explore with my device.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Provides clear audio & video. Control music & light conveniently through withbaby app on your smart phone. Only flaw is that there is a few seconds delay on audio & video.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I will begin by saying that I wasn't too sure that I'd like the show before I started watching it and even a few episodes in. The reason is that there is so much going on, so many characters that are referenced that it can be difficult to keep up. However, this uncertainty didn't last long for me. I am now emotionally invested in the characters and the future of Downtown Abbey.<br /><br />This show is set in the pre and post Great War. There are little things that are weaved into the storyline that remind us of what we now take for granted: swivel chairs, toasters, and cars, for example.<br /><br />There are bigger issues that affect the characters of Downtown Abbey such as World War I, the women's rights movement, gay rights, and Modernism. There is definitely a tug of war between conservative English values and the direction the modern world is taking.<br /><br />On top of that, we have characters who are dealing with timeless issues such as love, heartbreak, economic downturns, etc. All of the characters add something special to the show. Even if something doesn't add up in the moment, it will eventually come back and make sense at some point near or far. The episodes resolve certain topics, which are settled by the end of an episode. But there are also other topics that continue on throughout the seasons.<br /><br />I can't get enough of Downton Abbey and look forward to watching future seasons.
0393314804|5.0|If you've seen the movie, absolutely read the book. The film does a fantastic job of interpreting this novel. I started having seen the film, and the book fleshes out everything I loved about the film beyond what I could ever have hoped for. It takes a couple pages to get used to the writing style (Welsh writes in a mostly phonetic rendition of the Scottish vernacular), but once that is tackled its a quick, sharp read.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Love the show, the action and story are perfectly written. It's the best tv show out right now, watch it
B005LAII62|4.0|A must see animated movie.  Another one of my favorites.  Even the music is great.  This movie is good for all ages, but I think adults enjoy it more than kids.  I know I do  :)
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very good, relaxing game. It is challenging and addictive. This game is great to occupy down time. I really like it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I heard so much about this series on Netflix I decided to purchase the first season.  Much to my chagrin after purchasing the DVD set it became available at Redbox.  It would have cost me $2.00 plus tax that would have been the better bargain
B00CZAYOWI|3.0|I bought this because we were going to a concert that they were going to sing this cd from start to finish.  I love the Cult, but not my favorite album.  This one is good, but just doesn't compare to their Love album
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book did not go where I thought it was going and I'm so glad. I loved the twists and turns in this story. I couldn't put it down.
B000PHVZNE|4.0|I went to see \\"Cast Away\\" in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded-on-deserted-island movies like \\"Mysterious Island\\" (1961), but was somewhat disappointed. Why? Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks' character in the film, Chuck Noland, is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small. As such, there's zero social interaction, except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson, and there's very little exploration of the island because it's so small. On top of this, the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous. Despite this, \\"Cast Away\\" was a surprise hit at the box office.<br /><br />Viewing it a second time, I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it, but there's still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act. So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure; this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you. There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.<br /><br />As noted above, the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out, but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues. Some questions the film might provoke: How exactly does a certain Fed-Ex package save Chuck's life? Where's God in all of this? The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to \\"Dick and Bettina\\", but at the end to just Bettina, what does this mean? Why the angel symbol of all things? Where does Chuck decide to go at the end?<br /><br />Like I said, \\"Cast Away\\" is a one-of-a-kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it. But, when you are, it's very satisfying and even... enlightening.<br /><br />The film runs 143 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter likes it and is getting to know about horses. She likes all the features provided in the app
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Sad to see it ending. Meeting the mom was not a letdown! Been an amazing 9 years! It was legendary
B006TVQU6C|5.0|I picked this case over the other ones because One: price is very reasonable. Two: Antec is a reputable brand, and had a case from them before.  Three: it has black metal inside and outside, so uniformity is important to me, and it has clean lines, no fancy stuff.  Four: It opens on both sides, so concealing wires is easier, and has a place for two more fans.  Five: it has USB 3.0 ports in the front, which is an important part of my decision.  I also went back to price too because most of the time I didn't need the fancy stuff, but I did need the USB 3.0 ports in the front.  The front panel is a little difficult to take off, but as long as you are careful it will be no problem.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros:<br />Easy setup<br />Great to use with PC/Chrome<br />Good picture with proper bandwidth<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not much use with tablet/smartphone yet outside of YouTube and Netflix... But that will likely change<br /><br />I have a two monitor PC and when my wife gets home, I start streaming her favorite show on my PC and cast it to our downstairs TV and then put the tab in the background and all the music/sound for her show goes to the tv. Then I put that tab in the background and now I can. Goof around on the internet while she watches the chew and we don't have to pay for cable. Also works great with ESPN go if you want to watch the big game, downloaded movies, music, etc. I got 2 of them now.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it is a page turner that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait to read the next book
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Thought this was going to be a whole lot cooler than it turned out to be. Only a few apps on it the rest you need if load into a chrome browser to watch... Ain't no body got time for that. Thought this would be cool, it not.
B009ANP4F4|1.0|I am sure that i would have liked the movie but right from the first time I opened it to watch the movie it constantly like freezed the frames so it did not play well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy! I read all three books in 4 days...I couldn't put them down. I can't wait for the movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very good game, and I love it. The updates are awesome. I recommend this app to you.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I thought the way in which the book was very interesting.  It gives the reader a since of how this could happen in real life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed the style of Liane Moriarty.  The plot had so many twists and characters were truly believable.  This book really captured my interest.
B000002IHU|5.0|The last great CD from Ratt. This was one of my favorite CDs from the 80s. I would recommend this CD for any Hair Band fanatic.

B009DH2PP4|5.0|Very easy to read. Detailed. Good directions and explanations of each step from both the art of brewing and the science of brewing. Would highly recommend to anybody just starting out.
B007AL48UK|3.0|Like the game but can't beat the last one to move on to next chest. Have played  this game for several weeks and it just will not let you move on to next treasure chest. I have finally decided to stop playing it . It's a waste of time at this point.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|Very disappointed I was bored the whole time don't waste your money on this movie ..I wish I didn't waste mine to late
015603283X|2.0|I get the feeling this book was meant to be tongue in cheek, but that, during translation, tongue and cheek became separated. As it stands, the writing here is overwrought, purple, inflated, and boring. There are two separate mysteries here, which never come together, which left me (and the protagonist) disappointed. This is a book I just *barely* got through. I kept going, and eventually, about halfway through, a mystery or two did rear their heads. Prior to that, I was just watching a schlemiel stumble around, drink gin, and smoke unfiltered cigarettes. The antique book trade info was all that kept me going, and even that was pretty dull. Calling this a suspense thriller for intellectuals is good marketing, but far from the truth. It's all atmosphere and no guts, no meat and potatoes. I can't imagine any veteran mystery or thriller fan putting up with this book. How it became such a huge success is one of those mysteries up there with Brittany Spears and Harry Potter. Oops. Shouldn't have said that. There are three blondes in the book with big boobs, no other women. The final one calls herself Irene Adler, and we never do find out her real name, where she came from, or what she's doing in the story. This, perhaps, is the most egregious of the book's many sins. But then, I suppose a book about summoning the devil should be sinful. Too bad there's so little pleasure to go along with it.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This show is absolutely hilarious.  With the DVD's we can pause to laugh.  And of course, re-watch those favorite episodes or scenes.
B00EQ30RVY|3.0|The Stone Temple Pilots aren't reinventing the wheel with Chester Bennington. The new singer's voice is versatile, raspy when needed (he can belt it out with the best of them) and similar to Scott Weiland's. In fact, the two sound practically interchangeable on a few tracks from \\"High Rise.\\" Bennington's lyrics are less oblique, and he tends to offer more positive and practical insights, but otherwise, it's not as if STP chose someone way out of their wheelhouse.<br /><br />These songs don't blow me away, but they're solid and melodic. Scott Weiland's pop sensibilities are not as prominent here, and the tunes with Bennington so far lack the exploration and sometimes deeper spacey interludes of a typical STP album. But given that this is an inaugural EP and a revamped lineup, we can cut the boys some slack. Dean Deleo's chunky, bouncy riffs and concise and fluid solos are becoming more signature as the years go by, and STP's rhythm section is as effortless as ever.<br /><br />The high point of \\"High Rise\\" for me is the final song, \\"Tomorrow,\\" which has the smooth rhythmic sound and moody vibe of \\"Glide\\" from [[ASIN:B000021XR5 No 4]].<br /><br />I have a hunch that Bennington will contribute better, more adventurous music to STP in the future, before the inevitable reunion with Weiland.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|The Jay Pritchett family is back in the groove in Season 4 of MODERN FAMILY. Big changes are afoot as Jay's gorgeous and much younger latina wife Gloria (Sofia Vergara) is about to make an addition to the family. MODERN FAMILY takes us on a delightful ride through the lives of this blended family. Gay son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet)already have an adopted daughter from Vietnam and are looking to also make an addition to their family. Daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) and her husband Phil (Ty Burrell)continue their antics as parents raising three boisterous kids. Although this blended family never seems to be in agreement, one this is certain - family bonds run strong and their unity and love makes MODERN FAMILY glow.<br /><br />Gloria and Phil have always been my favorities. Fiery, sexy, and saucy Gloria heats up the screen every time we see her. Lovable Phil is the goofy father that would embarrass any child but his innocence and purity of love for his family makes any of wish we had had a father like Phil. Phil loves Claire but has a harmless secret attraction to Gloria and it is fun to watch them interact. Phil would never cheat on Claire but one wonders what goes through his fantasy mind when around Gloria.<br /><br />Season 4 centers on Gloria's pregnancy and the impending birth of her and Jay's child. Nothing will be the same for Jay as he turns 65 and is about to be a father. Somehow it will all work out and we always know that. Child prodigy Manny (from Gloria's previous marriage) has formed a strong bond with stepfather Jay. Manny is a teenager trapped in the body of a 50-year old.  The three Dunphy kids are still giving their parents joy and grief. The two daughters Haley and Alex follow so many cliches in TV families--Haley is slow-witted, gorgeous and boy crazy while sister Alex is the brains of the family and the never causes a problem kid. It's son Luke (Nolan Gould) who really stands out this season. Quirky and somewaht oafish like his father, Luke has a spark this season. His monotone way of speaking and his vacant eyes are giving away to something special. It will be interesting to see how his character develops as he matures.<br /><br />MODERN FAMILY is the lovable but annoying family that most of wish we had had. The family is unified in their love and their joy is evident. It's one of the best comedies on TV and a great source of joy and satisfaction for the viewer.
1476734941|5.0|It was new, I paid $5.40. It definitely met my expectations .  Great book, makes a lot of sense to give body a rest from having to process so much food always
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I've been playing Zombie Gunship since iOS and glad to finally have it on Android! It's easy to pick up and play. Rounds can be short or long depending on how many waves of zombies you can slaughter before they enter the bunker. And zombies move faster during late game providing more of a challenge.<br /><br />My friends and I usually challenge each other to see who can get a higher score. Two thumbs up for making such a unique zombie game where you're actually shooting zombies from up above in an AC-130!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I had heard about this show for a long time - now I know why - the writing is great!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn does a very nice job developing the primary characters. the book becomes a page turner after that, with several unexpected twists that keep the reader in suspense.
B008X5XP9M|3.0|I didn't realize the extent of the operation until I read this book. It's amazing anyone came out alive. I recommend reading this book for yourself.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have played this game since it came out.  I love it.  Now I can play it on my Kindle.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is the best show on tv! The character development is so great, and the 4th season does not disappoint.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love it .Whole family enjoys<br />Great experience with the entire process. Experiencing a deeper understanding of the Potter story which I am unable to do because I do not have the time to read the entire book collection.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|For me, the worst thing about Gary Renard's books is that before I start reading one, I had better make sure I've cleared out my schedule for a day or two!  It never fails, I find my face glued into his darned book until I reach the last blessed page.  But, truly I feel blessed with his books.  Thank you Pursah and Arten too.  Always a breath of fresh air.  In addition to teaching the Course in a very inviting way, this book also includes more information about both our own world, and other worlds beyond the one we live on.<br /><br />Regarding Gary's discussions of some of the \\"disagreements\\" that he \\"seemed\\" to become involved in, in recent years:  The Course community appears now to have successfully \\"weathered\\" a number of somewhat unexpected \\"storms\\" in the last decade or so.  One of those \\"storms\\" seemed to involve Gary serving as a certain sort of a \\"lightning rod\\" for controversy.  Gary happened to write this book during that particular \\"stormy\\" episode, and as a result, I think this book reasonably hints at some of these more \\"stormy times\\".  In my opinion, if he had completely \\"omitted\\" any reference to these \\"storms\\", I would have felt that his book had actually been \\"dishonest\\".<br /><br />We are all both students and teachers of the Course.  The Course was not meant to be a \\"popularity contest\\". It was meant to be a means of reuniting with one another, and thereby ultimately with our Creator. I think I'm not alone in my hope that we all might have some slightly \\"smoother sailing\\" ahead in our Course community's next few years.  Thanks for another great book Gary.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I've always liked the idea of an automatic watch, but could never find one that wasn't &#34;clunky&#34; and cluttered with stuff I don't need. This Seiko is really ideal in my opinion. It is the right size and weight for the average man's wrist, it's dial is clean and simple, the hands are legible in the dark and the strap is really comfortable. What's more, it keeps time to within 5  seconds a day. I'd be happy with a minute! Now that I've written my review, I'm going to change my 4 star rating to a 5 star. What a bargain.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I like GI Joe, and love the Rock and WIllis, in most anything they are in. The show had good action, nothing too over-the-top (for a GI Joe flick), maybe it was because they spent so much time on Snake-Eyes and Stormshadow, or maybe it was too much plot, or too 'far out plot', or...well, I don't know.<br /><br />Something about it just didn't 'drive my attention well', I lost focus in the show a couple of times, felt like continuity breaks, like 'I'd rather be online ordering a pizza than sitting here watching this right now' feeling. Not sure, for the weapons and fight scenes and A-list actors and solid acting, it just wasn't 'convincing', maybe?...<br /><br />I got this at the 'Box Kiosk' locally, and am actually glad I didn't shell out $4 for a rental, I think I would have been upset if I had. at $1.25, I just write it off to 'Mt. Dew or GI Joe Movie night', and I turned the Dew down. Oh well, bad choices happen. This is a 'filler movie', at best. You can do better, there's better flicks out there.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved the graphics and the storyline. Could have kept right on playing endlessly. Hope other is a sequel! Can't wait to play the sequel or to forget enough of the game to play it again. Would recommend to friend that like hidden object/adventure games.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This should be read by all who are interested in the history of religion. The background of the development of Christianity is certainly eye-opening.
B00DQHZZ0O|3.0|Be aware this is a sticker. The kit comes with 4 parts. (1) a guide. (2) a small threaded ring with a sticky back (3) a clip on filter adaptor (4) a string with 2 rings<br /><br />The guide (1) is used just once to help you stick the ring (2) to the camera in the exact correct spot. The ring (2) sticks with sticky tape basically. Once it's on you can a clip on/off the filter adaptor (3). The string with 2 rings (4) will help you pry the ring(1) off the camera but the manual points out once you do that it won't be sticky enough to put back on.<br /><br />It works but it's kind of wonky and I suspect that eventually ring will work itself off at which point you'll have to buy another (or use some kind of glue). I can certainly imagine the ring being pushed and pulled in my pocket. Maybe less so in a camera bag. Also if you don't take the filter adaptor off the moment you're done I can imagine straining the ring by bumping the filter adaptor etc and eventually it will come off.<br /><br />Of course given I don't know of any alternatives that's basically what we get.
B00000DUE7|5.0|I'm not a newcomer to and yet definitely not an expert in classical music, but most of the volumes in this set are superb! At this point I can especially appreciate volume 1, but the rest will surely grow on me after I've had the change to give them all several spins. What drew me to this particular set is the quality of the recordings, which is quite good.
B00340LM8C|5.0|classic hitchcock; classic cary grant; classic grace kelly<br />even if you've seen this before, it's always great to watch these actors -- and see how sexy grace kelly can be while keeping all her cloths on.

B00A3DZ61W|5.0|We love this game.  My grandchildren love all the angry birds games.  Good graphics and love the characters and weapons!
B0097PW7H8|5.0|While Battery Doctor has improved my Kindle Fire run time substantially,it worked even better on my Nexus 7 tablet,which was a power hog before I installed BD. The App worked so well, I also installed  on our smartphones.Really good app.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Just finished Dr. Sleep.  I had preordered in March, and when it magically appeared on my Kindle, I was thrilled.  As with all of King's books, I promised myself that I wouldn't gobble it up in a weekend, and this time, I was able to stretch it out for 2 weeks.<br />I truly enjoyed the story.  Dan Torrance, all grown up, was as endearing as Danny Torrance the 5 year old.  It was great fun to read all of the references to \\"The Shining,\\" which I first read as a teenager.  I don't know if Mr. King is still capable of writing stories that could scare me into keeping the curtains closed and the radio on, like \\"'Salem's Lot,\\" but he definitely can still write a story with characters I care about, nifty little plot twists and scenes that wrench my heart (spoiler!), like the dying orderly at the end of the story, worrying about his little dog. Scenes like that, inconsequential slices of life that are so real it brings tears to my eyes.  Sure, the guy was a jerk, but at the end he was scared and concerned about the things he loved, and Mr. King can still capture that fear and concern with a spooky, Everyman realism that brings such a \\"wow-could-this-really-happen?\\" quality to nearly everything I've read that he's written.  Good stuff, great stuff, and I'll continue reading everything he writes.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Classic Kinsella. Funny, witty, unbelievable! A fantastically fun book. Drawn out at times, but suspenseful. A nice easy holiday  read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game but the pc version is way better. The updates are slow to. Hurry up mojang
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a great hidden object game. The story/adventure part doesn't make much sense, but the game play is good enough to make you overlook that. I actually used the hint feature three times to get through a scene and determine what action to take next. With a little more patience you won't have to use it at all. The graphics are great, some of the best I've seen lately. At one point I thought I was watching a horror movie. If you're looking to entertain yourself for a few hours without draining your brain, this is for you.
B005KD5UAW|5.0|Yes that one song on here sounds like that Nick Cave song you love so what Nic probably knows it and probably used it as a jumping off point and if you want to you can google around and find out for yourself. Discogs classes this as &#34;Downtempo, Deep House, Ambient&#34; which I can live with but my favorite parts are the jazziest parts. It is not upbeat OH WELL. I give it 5 stars because it is excellent.
B001DLWF8U|1.0|I wasted enough time watching this so I won't waste any more other than the time it takes to warn you not to waste yours.
B00CZ632R0|5.0|It is a creature of beauty and precision. Doesn't seem forced at all, but maybe a little to technical. No mess here. Hopkins is an artisan. Individual songs as well as the album as a whole is perfectly paced.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This just came yesterday and my son had a great time playing with it. He loves the little animals. He is 21 months old and will enjoy playing with this.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|My 5th reading of this book. Each time I get something new. This book has helped me during very hard times. It doesn't tell what the meaning is-it is different for each of us. But to live we must be searching, as did the author during a very hard life. We have much to learn from Viktor Frankl, survivor of horrors I can't even imagine. If he can survive the holocaust then I can survive my small travails.
B000V7J7ZG|5.0|I have always loved this release - but hearing it on this vinyl re-issue was another level - never had the original on vinyl  - the mastering and recording of this LP is spectacular - like being in the room with Tom and his play...<br /><br />update - you really have to see the film \\"Big Time\\" to understand this album....for the Tom fans.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|What can I say, but pour a glass of wine or two and read.  Don't see the movie until AFTER you read the novel.  You will find the movie more enjoyable. This is a female-oriented novel in my opinion, but a classic everyone should read.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Miley has come back to music strong! This album has heart wrenching ballads and those songs that you just wanna dance to at a party, just amazing!

B00CUG8GAS|5.0|I very descriptive account of white tenant farmers living in Africa.  Fuller's account made you feel you were actually part of the day to day living of this resourceful family.  I loved it!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Fantastic book, cannot wait for the third in the series. Absolutely great story but still a lot of unanswered questions.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I'm a 58 yr old gay woman and I LOVE this album---especially GetItRight, FU and 4 by 4----there's so many interesting things going on in the production of each song and great range of styles. Miley's voice has soul and humor. GetItRight is so sexy---love Miley's natural androgyny and Guts!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Boring, boring, boring. It just seemed violent and tortured. Read half and deleted it. Sylvia Day is much better. Not worth the money.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Graphic s are good, but takes too long to load, after every run. Loading takes too long, not kid friendly, sorry to say...
B00DMEQP46|3.0|Not as catchy as their first album, not as mind blowing as their second, but maybe I'm not on enough drugs to appreciate it. Seriously though I'm just not impressed with it. I was expecting something great like weekend wars or siberian breaks. Now alien days is great but....I don't know, just not immediately impressed like I thought I would be. I will keep playing until something clicks I guess because I know these dudes don't put filler on albums. Sorry, I support these guys but this is honestly how I feel about it.
0143116738|5.0|Highly recommend this book to ped students, (educational) counseling students, as well as teachers. It´s well written, informative and entertaining.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Excellent scripting, acting and editing, and great storyline. This episode sets the stage for a great series. Very highly recommended.
1452115567|5.0|Love Maddie and her tour. Would support Theron and Maddie as they travel around the country. Great coffee table book as well as gift to an animal lover
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This game is so amazing, i love it<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fun and easy chooseable controls<br />Great gameplay<br />Updated roster<br />Great association mode<br />Path to greatness<br />Multiplayer<br />Easy download<br /><br />Cons:<br />Low graphics<br />Sometimes lags (but not bad)<br />No MY CAREER<br /><br />Overall it was an amazing game that was easy to download and is still fun to play. 5 stars
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|Most games have a free starter like this one. Anything else costs so make sure that you have &#34;in games charges&#34; turned off, or you could get a nasty surprise. Applies to most free games.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The suspense is well-done, but I found the plot too far-fetched. At times, Amy -- one of the 2 main characters -- felt more like a caricature than a credible character.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Intense , romantic and mouth watering . It's sucks you and are totally engulfed in this amazing sensual world .
B00ELD19OI|5.0|Wow...simply brilliant from start to end. Like any good progressive music you discover new things every time you listen to it, no exception here. Amazing music, amazing vocals, amazing lyrics, I'll easily put this album on top 3 best progressive albums of the year.
B003B02O14|5.0|Great book...captivating story..absolutely wonderful to read a story with romance...excitement...sitting on the edge of your seat type thriller...definitely recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Always a fan. I appreciate the adult Danny Torrance and continuation of the thread of The Shining. I think it held true to the original story.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Interesting look at race and class, compassion and brutality, love and loss. All things are not as they appear. This is a book worth picking up.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I love anything written by Michael Connelly. The Lincoln lawyer was brought to the screen exceptionally well I thought. Matthew Mc Conaughey really embodied the character. What an excellent cast. Really enjoyable all the way. I wish there were more movies like this one around.
B004YXE438|4.0|I enjoy this app after a long day at work.  It's relaxing while challenging too. It's nice to start at an easy level and progress to the harder ones.
B00DU74U74|5.0|An actually good movie. Close to the book although the book was way more detailed but it worked nevertheless. I felt there was a lesson here about really observing instead of going with some rote pre concieved idea on how things are.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Thought it was really great. Loved the movie the first time i saw it and had to watch again. The picture quality from Amazon prime was excellent.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|From the first moment I saw the first show, I knew this would be a hit series. The humor was really, really good. Excellent cast of characters. Their interactions with each other very true to life. But the humor in the writing as this modern family is showcased is the key to it's success!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My grand kids love to play this game .I also enjoy this game. The building of the village is great with all the different animals. So much like the ice age movie and scat the squirrel trying to keep the acorns is funny how he runs across the screen.<br />Love love it.....
B00445RHKI|5.0|Because it's fresh and very funny. It shows what a modern family is nowadays. No one is perfect but very real characters with a lot of humor in situations that often times are not humorous!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I  personally love horses so this app is awesome. I absolutely love this game you get to take care of your very own horse! I would rate this app ten stars if I could. I recommend it to all horse lovers. Also see my review on saras pretty pet paulor.
B005OP2928|5.0|Excellent show! Really a great look at modern families. very real to me and the humor is wonderful. The characters are all great and really likeable. Very realistically portraided.
0486282112|5.0|I HAD TO READ FOR SCHOOL. IT WAS  A READING ASSIGNMENT. IT WAS A GREAT BOOK. I DONT THINK I WOULD HAD READ IT IF IT WERENT FOR SCHOOL
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Love the stories. Best show on currently! When will season 5 start? Or is that it? It may have gone to syndication already.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great mind game, it makes you think. It's like trying to find your way out of a very big maze, very interesting. makes you want to find solutions to the next step. Very interesting.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|I had and have always been a fan of hers and really enjoyed learning about her life. What a crazy life she has ha!
B007UW9VWO|5.0|A perfectionist's owners manual. Very enjoyable, makes you want to go out and get the best quality sushi after<br />watching it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really liked this book, well written and interesting ending. Author did a great job with a very difficult emotional situation
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Needed a replacement cable for my Kindle. Not much more to say since it is the same cable I got originally.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. You should buy it because it's awesome and quick and it'll be over before you know it
B001RPD06I|5.0|I purchased this for a Pantech Breeze III.  Works exactly as expected.  Some of the &#34;cheaper&#34; SD cards have a slightly offset shape and won't fit well into the card slot.  This one gave no trouble at all.
B00CL151G4|4.0|Great show, great acting, great character development. Would've loved to see some more extras (commentaries, gag reel etc) but it's totally worth it. Even if you've never heard of Sherlock Holmes.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|This is, with no doubt, one of the BEST films i ever seeing in my life.  Excellent manage of this famous minister.
1476734941|5.0|I've only been on the program for two weeks,  And I haven't been too strict with myself yet!  I eat a few almonds or mixed nuts mid-day when I get hungry.  As the book suggests, I find myself trying to eat better/smaller on my Non-fast days.  Yesterday was an exception:  I drank a soda which I almost never do.  Six years ago I cut back from 2-3 per week to maybe 1 a month.  Sodas have no goodness in them other than taste and fizz.  They are actualy bad for you.  No excuse for still having some on hand!  I also ate 3 cookies. Just weighed myself and I'm one lb heavier than I was yesterday morning. Back on track today.<br /><br /> My weight loss goal is 10 lbs.  I bought the book and am on the program for the health benefits in addition to weight loss.  Heart disease and strokes are in my family, as well as type 2 diabetes.  I'm hoping to have  healthier Senior Years than my parents and their parents.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love this show, I am not done with season 1 yet, but I will be this weekend.  I can't stop watching.  GREAT SHOW!!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|John Malkovich is hysterical as the paranoid who actually is being chased by spies.  Helen Miren is the tough broad.  Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure to watch and Mary-Louise Parker is excellent as the innocent but stalwart love interest unwittingly sucked into a diabolical plot by sinister forces.  Funny and fun.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book ticked me off most of the time. It was clear that Christian was a control freak most of the time, but it was overdone; and Anastasia not standing up for herself was infuriating to read, being an independent woman. The ending was fulfilling though.... and then it brings you right back in. You'll have to read it to find out why. ;)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Cant stop once I start. Addicted and do not want to rehab Tell all my friends to start their habit....Recommend to anyone! Love this game....
B008RKIACK|5.0|Classic !!!!! Have seen this movie several times. If u havent seen it and like to be entertained see this movie
B00CATSONE|5.0|What amazing man,i discovered so much more about Nikola Tesla WOW! over 800 patents. I was also very enlightened about his relationship with Thomas Edison.<br />  This is really a good free read, and some pretty good advice i thought.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Best book I've read in 60 years!  If you are a dog lover you will no doubt think the same!  I recommend this book wholeheartedly!
B008D28HYS|4.0|A great puzzle app if you like logic games. The controls could be easier (It was too easy to press on the wrong square) but it quickly gets challenging even for an experienced logic app fan. Recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is awesome.  It is a bit unclear in the beginning but then it takes OFF!!  I could not put it down.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very well written book with many story lines.  This was the 1st book I purchased on my Kindle, and I enjoyed it immensely!
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Excellent looking forward to season 3 one of the best tv shows ever written! Keeps your interest. Professional performance by all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|3 words.... BEST BOOK EVER!!!<br />Best story line, filled with sex, love, comedy, romance.  Every woman's fantasy !!!  MUST READ
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|Great movie and I love, love, love it and I will watch it many times. Love Harrison ford in anything great actor
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|I like the app but i feel it need more. Like humidity relative more visible and if its posible more psychrometric facts
B005GRTNXC|5.0|Awesome great songs melodic and great beats.<br />Love that she featured other singers as wekl.<br />Truly one of her best.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Good movie. The first part make people laugh, the second part make people moved a lot. I watched it 2 times!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was going to get this app for my grandchildren but find myself playing it to see what level I can reach and how quickly.  :-)
B004NSULHM|5.0|Clever, surprising and surely different from any other Radiohead's work, yet another proof of their musucal innovative genius; love it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Seiko watches are quality... albeit a little be expensive.  I paid less then 60 for this watch and I highly recommend it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This booked seemed too end abruptly.  Many loose ends tied up at the last minute over a few pages with little detail. After so many books I would have expected more.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I played on it for a while and loved it. But it sucks because it made my kindle turn off a couple times it frustrated me it also made it go to a black screen so I deleted it because I didn't want it to ruin my new kindle fire it did this over and over again please has it happened to anyone else
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I love this movie.  I enjoyed how it tied in the Avenger movie.  There isn't much that Robert Downey Jr. has attempted in recent years that hasn't been golden.  The quirkiness of his character makes me smile.  I have watched this movie several times and every time I come away with a since of satisfaction.  The twist with the &#34;terrorist&#34; is priceless.  All of the characters are very well suited to their roles.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I really liked the first book in the series (Mortal Instruments; City of Bones) and this is a continuation of the story. I read it in a few days and ordered the next book in the series as well. This series makes you want to continue reading them all to find out what happens next. Very entertaining, fast paced and well written books!
B00F91G5BS|1.0|If you are expecting something even close to the book you will be sorely disappointed. Bad story telling, a ridiculous ending, and inconsistent acting.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|It's was the best deal ever. Tks for offering this. Thanks again. I hope I'll be able to purchased more in the future.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Princesses have come to Disney's rescue more than once. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs took Walt Disney and his studio from short subjects into the much more prestigious world of feature films. Cinderella brought the studio back from the WWII setbacks. And The Little Mermaid re-ignited Disney animation, officially launching a second golden age.<br /><br />It also redefined the musical form of animated features for the first time since Snow White. That is due largely to the vision of lyricist Howard Ashman, who can be seen on the bonus features conducting one of his insightful lectures. With the spectacular music of composer Alan Menken (who made his debut as an underscore composer with this film), the results reverberated throughout the entertainment industry.<br /><br />Those of us who still pine for cel animation (or 2-D, which seems dismissive) have so much to savor in this film, in particular Glen Keane's animation of Ariel herself. Even though elements of earlier Disney heroines were referenced (including Alice), no previous Disney animated lady ever had the range of expression as Ariel, thanks in no small part to the live modeling done by Sherri Stoner, who you can see in the best of the numerous bonus features, \\"Under the Scene: The Art of Live Action Reference.\\" (Fans of Animaniacs also know her writing and acting in that great show.)<br /><br />As to acting in The Little Mermaid, the cast is superb, from the leads like Pat Carroll as Ursula to little gems like the seahorse voiced by Will Ryan. What might be overlooked is the fact that Jodi Benson plays two roles: Ariel and her \\"evil twin,\\" Vanessa), both so distinctly that it's easy to think of them as two different voice actors). A little bit of trivia, too, about Sam Wright, who voices Sebastian: he was one of the featured players in the 1974 Broadway show, Over Here!, the first such show with music and lyrics by Richard and Robert Sherman (check out the cast CD, it's great).<br /><br />One quirky note: Is it just me, or does Prince Eric look a lot like David Seville from the '80s Saturday morning cartoon version of Alvin and the Chipmunks?<br /><br />If you want to have the lion's share of bonus features on DVD, keep your Platinum Edition or find a used copy. Almost everything is only on the Blu-ray, as listed below:<br />2013 DIAMOND EDITION (2013)<br /><br />Blu-ray Bonus Features<br />* \\"Part of your World\\" Music Video - Carly Rae Jepsen<br />* @DisneyAnimation: Go behind the Scenes with Today's Top Disney Animators<br />  (with Ron Clements, John Musker, Mark Henn, Ruben Aquino, Brittney Lee,<br />  Hyun-Min Lee, Kira Lehtomaki, Chad Sellers and John Kahrs)<br />*  Deleted Character - Harold the Merman<br />* Under the Scene: The Art of Live Action Reference (Ron Clements, John Musker,<br />  Kathryn Beaumont, Sherri Stoner, Joshua Finkel)<br />* Part of Her World - Jodi Benson's Voyage to New Fantasyland (includes<br />  Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Disney's Art of Animation Resort )<br />* Howard's Lecture<br />* Crab-E-Oke Sing Along<br />* John & Ron Make Caricatures of Each Other<br />* Animators Comment on Their Characters<br />* Clements and Musker Demonstrating \\"The Little Mermaid Handshake\\"<br />* Treasures Untold - The Making of The Little Mermaid<br />* Storm Warning: The Little Mermaid Special Effects Unit<br />* Audio Commentary<br />* Kiss the Girl - Ashley Tisdale Music Video<br />* Disney Song Selection<br />* The Little Match Girl (2006 Short)<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Fathoms Below\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Backstage with Sebastian<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Sebastian Lost in the Castle<br />* Deleted Scene: Advice from Sebastian<br />* Deleted Scene: Fight With Ursula (Alternate Ending)<br />* Deleted Song: \\"Silence is Golden\\" (Song Demo)<br />* Under the Sea Adventure: A Virtual Ride inspired by Disney Imagineers<br />  (Ride the Attraction / Ride with Disney Imagineers/ Behind the Ride that Never Was)<br />* Disneypedia: Life Under the Sea<br />* The Story Behind the Story<br />* Under the Sea Early Presentation Reel<br />* Original Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />DVD Bonus Features<br />* Part of Her World - Jodi Benson's Voyage to New Fantasyland (includes<br />  Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Disney's Art of Animation Resort )<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Fathoms Below\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Fight With Ursula (Alternate Ending)<br /><br />2006 PLATINUM EDITION<br />* Treasures Untold: The Making of The Little Mermaid<br />* Storm Warning: The Little Mermaid Special Effects Unit<br />* Audio Commentary<br />* Kiss the Girl - Ashley Tisdale Music Video<br />* Disney Song Selection<br />* The Little Match Girl (2006 Short)<br />* Original Theatrical Trailer<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Fathoms Below\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Backstage with Sebastian<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Sebastian Lost in the Castle<br />* Deleted Scene: Advice from Sebastian<br />* Deleted Scene: Fight With Ursula (Alternate Ending)<br />* Deleted Song: \\"Silence is Golden\\" (Song Demo)<br />* Under the Sea Adventure: A Virtual Ride inspired by Disney Imagineers<br />  (Ride the Attraction / Ride with Disney Imagineers / Behind the Ride that Never Was)<br />* Disneypedia: Life Under the Sea<br />* The Story Behind the Story<br />* Original Theatrical Trailer<br />* Under the Sea Early Presentation Reel<br />* The Little Mermaid III Musical Sneak Peek (Direct-to-DVD promo)<br />* Art Galleries/ Behind the Ride that Never Was)<br />* Disneypedia: Life Under the Sea<br />* The Story Behind the Story<br />* Under the Sea Early Presentation Reel<br />* Original Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />DVD Bonus Features<br />* Part of Her World - Jodi Benson's Voyage to New Fantasyland (includes<br />  Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Disney's Art of Animation Resort )<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Fathoms Below\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Fight With Ursula (Alternate Ending)<br /><br />2006 PLATINUM EDITION<br />* Treasures Untold: The Making of The Little Mermaid<br />* Storm Warning: The Little Mermaid Special Effects Unit<br />* Audio Commentary<br />* Kiss the Girl - Ashley Tisdale Music Video<br />* Disney Song Selection<br />* The Little Match Girl (2006 Short)<br />* Original Theatrical Trailer<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Fathoms Below\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Backstage with Sebastian<br />* Deleted Scene: \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\" Alternate Version<br />* Deleted Scene: Sebastian Lost in the Castle<br />* Deleted Scene: Advice from Sebastian<br />* Deleted Scene: Fight With Ursula (Alternate Ending)<br />* Deleted Song: \\"Silence is Golden\\" (Song Demo)<br />* Under the Sea Adventure: A Virtual Ride inspired by Disney Imagineers<br />  (Ride the Attraction / Ride with Disney Imagineers / Behind the Ride that Never Was)<br />* Disneypedia: Life Under the Sea<br />* The Story Behind the Story<br />* Original Theatrical Trailer<br />* Under the Sea Early Presentation Reel<br />* The Little Mermaid III Musical Sneak Peek (Direct-to-DVD promo)<br />* Art Galleries
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game this is like the best game I ever played love itttt I sure have fun playing it too yhuee guys. And also ME and my sis are going against each other on this this is like our favorite game I downloaded games and don't even play them wow crazy old me HAHAHAHA .
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My two year old son loves this game. He just laughs and laughs. Its a gret way to entertain littleones. Works when my phone is in airplane mode
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The game is great! The graphics are better than deer hunter reloaded. The game play is great. If there was one single thing they could have added in order to make it EVEN better, would be stampede mode
B00742H26M|4.0|Despite the almost terminal goodness of our heroine, this work holds up well, really well. It's taken from an unfinished Austin novel; the writer/director gets credit for making plot twists (illness! quelle surprise!) carry on. And British actors, well, always tops.
B0041VT6HW|5.0|GREAT STORY,EXCELLENT CAST,AWESOME SOUNDTRACK,BETTER EVERY SHOWING.THIS MOVIE HAS IT ALL,FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.FLAWLESS BLU-RAY PRODUCTION,EASILY TOP TEN OF THE SEASON!!!
0061122416|5.0|If you are simply looking for a work of fiction, this may or may not be for you.<br /><br />If you are willing to take a look at the story alongside your own life, you will likely find value in reading this book.<br /><br />I have recommended it to many, and whoever you are... if you are seeking answers, and are open minded enough to find them wherever you are, buy this book and read it!<br /><br />The power is not in the story, but rather your own journey as it relates to this story.  If you are open to it, you will see the parallels.  I found it to be amazing.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|The latest release from Alice in Chains certainly lived up to the hype.  It has the classic AIC sound, but moves in a progressive direction that makes it a great addition to any current rock library.  I highly recommend it for AIC fans as well as anyone looking for a great rock album.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|If they wanted a serious, scary movie the creators should have fleshed it out more and done more to get the viewer emotionally invested in the characters & fate of the world. There is so much obvious cgi and the premise so far stretched that it could have gone the route of a comedy (like Zombieland). Everything happens very quickly and there's so much fake mayhem that it's difficult to get hooked into this. Obviously made to get as many summer movie goer butts in the seats as possible.
B008R96NIY|3.0|A thorough, decent, well written account of the origins of the Great War.  I was expecting something somewhat more original, but  Christopher Clark delivers a very solid and thorough multi-angled analysis of the subject.  Well written and full of interesting tidbits,  however not that innovative.
B00FPH6M82|5.0|Its a good family movie, my 5 and 12 year old loved this movie, the Smith's are a talented family.
B004VOBIE8|4.0|It works for me.  My husband downloaded it and showed me how it works.  It works great on my kindle.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I choose the five stars as it was good to see the Walkers and Grimes gang.  Plus, got to pass it my son who enjoyed it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is a great game to play anytime. It is not violent at all. The dragons have cool designs and look awesome. It is a game for all ages and is super fun getting dragons and breeding dragons. I love how there are rare dragons and I hope that I can breed all of them. It is a awesome game.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|My daughter likes this game quite a lot.  It's not too time consuming, and offers some neat options to change up the appearance of the game.
B00F35BV64|3.0|A fantastic cast was wasted on mediocre revision of the original Gene Roddenberry character Khan. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
0756407915|5.0|I have enjoyed reading them as much the 2nd time around as I did the first. Perhaps even more.<br />Can't wait for Book three, but you can't hurry perfection.  Love these books.  What else has he written. I must research this and read them as well.  Day Three??? Anytime in 2013?
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'd like to see the writers and director take on more of these normally boring children's fables.
B001BFFTO0|4.0|I normally wear a 12.5 or 13. I had to go through 3 pairs of these boots before arriving on the right size, an 11.5. Do yourself a favor and order two sizes. One size that's 1 shoe size smaller than your normal size, and another 1.5 sizes smaller than your normal size.<br /><br />Then simply return the one that doesn't fit! Save yourself the trouble.<br /><br />Other than that, these boots are very comfortable. You'll definitely want high socks so you don't rub your shins raw all day.<br /><br />I'm noticing already on the first day of wearing, that there are small sections where the sole of the shoe seems to be separating from the shoe.<br /><br />I'll try and report back if this becomes problematic. It's very minor right now, hardly noticeable, but it may open up more with wear.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Great story with a great supporting cast. As always, Tom Cruise over-acting diminished what could have been an otherwise great movie.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|AS a long time Stephen King reader, I've come to expect a certain depth of character and descriptive writing, plus a truly tense, taunt plotline.  This one is just blah. The characters are pretty one dimensional - and don't inspire much love or hate.  I won't read this one 10 times like I did the Shining.  The dialogue isn't up to his usual standard either.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|this show was totally worth it.  I had some pretty frustrating issues trying to navigate prime on my i pad, but onnce I was able to sort it out, I had a great experiece.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun little game that becomes very challenging on the higher difficulty levels. Keeps the game interesting and makes you think.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing this game although there are some cliches. Screen froze and I lost coins, power ups and keys. My current problem is I can't use my last two power ups. It gives me the option to purchase more every time I get down to two. What's up with that?
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Not a great movie ... Just a so-so movie. Okay, I would rather have those two hours back to my life.
B000TU16GS|4.0|Well written, making it is interesting to both kids and adults.  Finally my kid is asking to sit down and read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love this book! For anyone who is on the path of growing their awareness this is a great little book. The concepts are written in an entertaining style and reinforces the Unity teachings which I like.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My family loves this show.  It has great humor and the storylines are great, the only problem is there is no more shows.  Please bring it back.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot wait for the next season! Started watching a single episode to pass the time at my daughters dance class. Before I knew it I had watched all three seasons.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I definitely give it two thumbs up. Steig Larsson definitely keeps the pace going in his next action thriller.  Wowee, Wowee.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It is a good read to pass the time, but the entire series did not meet my expectations.  Would not recommend as a must read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun- really gets you thinking. Could easily spend hours playing this but equally can pick up when you have a spare 10/15 minutes.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|I waited so long for this album to be released !<br />Awesome album! Can not wait to see it live!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Great story.  It is dreamlike and childlike underscored with real illustrations of good and evil and of love and sacrifice.  This is a beautifully written, hard to put down book.
B005UG542S|5.0|I liked part 2 because it kept my attention. I also liked it because it followed the book so closely. The portrayal of events and characters was very much like I had imagined them.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E-squared is a fun and fasinating book filled with how it change your negative thoughts into positive ones and how to make things happen in your life that you want to happen.  It gives you experiments to help you achieve your goals.<br />Absolutely fantastic read.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|It's a self-titled review. Get it?<br /><br />I have been a big Dream Theater fan for many years now. Admittedly, they kind of lost me for a while with the albums Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds, but brought me back in a big way with A Dramatic Turn of Events. (if you're interested, check out my review of ADTOE here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9NKKKOQNSOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005974CNA)<br /><br />Their latest release is a self-titled album consisting of 9 new songs, which include two instrumentals and one 22-minute epic. I was a little puzzled by their choice to not give the album a title. Typically an eponymous release represents a change in direction. However for a progressive band, that should be expected anyway. I also could not say that I was much a fan of the minimalist cover art for the album, from a band that I'm used to seeing very grand artwork from (honestly, the cover would look better without the logo).  These strange little biases aside,  I have now given the album several listens and feel as though I am able to give it a proper review.<br /><br />I don't normally like to give song-by-song critiques, but I feel like a review of this album might be better by focusing on each song.<br /><br />1. False Awakening Suite<br />- This is nothing more than an intro track to the album. Contrary to some intro tracks on previous albums (\\"Regression\\" on Scenes, or \\"Overture\\" on Six Degrees), False Awakening Suite does not tease movements from the songs that will follow it on the rest of the album. That said, it is still a very cool intro song, and will sound cool as a live intro. Stylistically, it is heavy and filled with guitar riffs, yet very symphonic. It reminds me of something I'd hear on a Within Temptation or Trans-Siberian Orchestra album.<br />2. The Enemy Inside<br />- The first single from the album. This is a fast, heavy song, with a pretty big chorus. I definitely hear some stylistic influence of European power metal on this song. Very good song.<br />3. The Looking Glass<br />- The first of two songs on this album with a strong Rush influence. The opening guitar riff sounds VERY influenced by Rush. I like this song, though, it feels like there are moments were riffing distracts from the overall flow of the song.<br />4. Enigma Machine<br />- This is an instrumental track. While there are some impressive technical moments in this song, the song is not a stand out track on the album. It feels as though it should an intro or a middle jam section of a larger song. There is no real main riff in the song to build a hook around, like for example, The Ytse Jam, or YYZ by Rush. Instead, the song comes off sounding like the jam section of Fatal Tragedy or Beyond This Life from Scenes From A Memory. It feels incomplete.<br />5. The Bigger Picture<br />- The second single for the album. This is a power ballad, with some sections feeling like a mid-tempo hard rock song, similar to songs like \\"Wither\\" from Black Clouds, \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" from Systematic Chaos, or \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" from Octavarium. Good, melodic song.<br />6. Behind The Veil<br />- Easily my favorite song on the album. This song is everything that I look for in a DT song. It is heavy and fast, with some very intricate parts, yet very melodic with a big, catchy chorus. The song has a drawn out, but very cool intro, and a cut time chorus that is probably the biggest hook on the album. This song, in my opinion, has the best structural flow of any song on the album. None of the parts feel out of place. The song clocks in at just under 7 minutes, but feels as though you're only listening to a 4-minute song. This one will be awesome live!<br />7. Surrender To Reason<br />- The second song with a strong Rush influence. Like with \\"The Looking Glass,\\" this song starts out and ends with a riff that sounds as though it was lifted from a Rush album. The middle jam section is also very reminiscent of Rush.  Aside from these parts, the song is typicalDT. A mid-tempo melodic rocker. Overall, a good song.<br />8. Along For The Ride<br />- A strong power ballad with some religious undertones. Jordan gives us his best Keith Emerson impression (something he already gave us once before on \\"Beneath The Surface\\" from A Dramatic Turn of Events). Not the strongest ballad that DT has ever done, but a very good song nonetheless.<br />9. Illumination Theory<br />- Dream Theater returns to the 20+ minute epic with this song. This is a decent song, but as far as DT's previous efforts on the epic song front, it falls short. I feel as though this song is unnecessarily long. Previous epics such as \\"A Change of Seasons,\\" \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence,\\" and \\"Octavarium\\" had distinct sections that all built toward a greater whole. I feel as though \\"Illumination Theory\\" could've been cut down to half of its length and not lost anything. The only real stand-out moment in the song is a 4-minute orchestrated section in the middle that, while beautiful, sounds incredibly out of place. The song finishes strong; everything from about 11 minutes on is really good. However, again, we find a completely unnecessary 2.5-minute instrumental section at the end after 30 seconds or so of silence that, while it sounds nice, sounds out of place. \\"Illumination Theory,\\" instead of sounding like a cohesive song, sounds more like a random assortment of parts thrown together.<br /><br />As you can likely gather from the above discussion on the individual songs, my overall impression of Dream Theater's self-titled album is that it is a good album, but there are too many flaws in it for me to call it a great album. Too many songs feature sections that seem forced, the instrumentals do not feel complete, the epic song at the end feels like a mixed bag of inconsistent ideas, and there are too many moments were they sound like they are trying to be a different band (yeah, I love Rush too, but Rush is better at writing Rush songs than Dream Theater is).<br /><br />All of these flaws aside, this is still a good album. Each subsequent listen finds me enjoying the album more and more. While I don't think this album will ever crack my top 5 as far as Dream Theater albums go, it is still a good album by theirs or anyone's standards.<br /><br />-KCDT. A mid-tempo melodic rocker. Overall, a good song.<br />8. Along For The Ride<br />- A strong power ballad with some religious undertones. Jordan gives us his best Keith Emerson impression (something he already gave us once before on \\"Beneath The Surface\\" from A Dramatic Turn of Events).

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All I  recommend is to play this game!!!! And get this app it is Sooooooooooooooo addicting and funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Hope you enjoy it!!!
B000FA675C|5.0|I've read this book three times - love it..  It will remain a favorite on my bookshelf and when I want to relax and escape at the same time, then I'll pick up The Da Vinci Code.  Quality of writing, captivating characters, suspense, historic locations - what more can the reader want?  A sequel... please!
0316247545|5.0|I am one of the fans of the show that would seem too old to get enjoyment out of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series. And yet, I do. It's a bit of a nostalgia trip I suppose. I remember watching the original My Little Pony series when I was younger. And the Friendship is Magic series was fun to watch and helped me stay entertained while I was recovering from a tonsillectomy.<br /><br />The book has a lot of interesting tidbits from the show's creators, something I'm always interested to learn about. I like learning more about the characters and seeing what the official lowdown on them is. The episode recap section of the book was good as well, since sometimes I don't understand what happened the first or even second time around when I watch an episode of a show.<br /><br />Thank you! The book got to me quickly and was in a good package. There was no damage to the package or book.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I thought it would be kinds of a throwback movie with a lot of cameos, which it was, but there was a lot of gore.  They could have done without all the blood.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I would like to send this to everyone to view.  It is surprising how many people have never heard of hydraulic fracturing.  I think it should be included in every science and environmental education program in schools.  The young should be informed of what is being done to the earth they are inheriting.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|total artsy movie.  Very slow moving.  mcconaughey was good, but this would have been more suited as a short movie, not a real full length movie
B003VANOFY|2.0|Has frequent disconnects because of inability to choose which wireless channel it uses in addition to using 2.4ghz.  The usb power port on teh headphones is also very hard.  Feel like i'm breaking the port everytime I charge my headset.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is a different take on the normal \\"romance\\" kind of novel. It is written from the male point of view. It is a completely fresh and new point of view. It is nice to see a book that has a different angle on the same stories. Can't wait for Emma Chase's next two books!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|love this show, wish it had more seasons but it is a great watch. a great show for any syfy lover.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|BEST GAME EVER! As soon as I played the game,I was never going to stop playing it!Get the game now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|... It has more of a teen fiction voice than other works by Sanderson.<br /><br />As usual Sanderson has interesting ideas and well thought out worlds - but this narrative was forced at times. And predictable. The metaphor joke and the Celtic references got old for me fast. But overall I did enjoy it and read it quickly.<br /><br />Looking forward to way of kings follow ups a lot more than the next installment of this.<br /><br />I could see this making a cool movie though. Epic concepts :)
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I like the convenience of multiple sized tips. I use one size for my tablet and the smaller for my smart phone sometimes.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Always tells me there is an update, but it fails due to a bad package parse. Almost never actually exits when I try to exit, I have to kill the app in settings. Drops connection all the time. Sound quality is a joke. Glad I got it for free, not worth any money. I have a Galaxy Note 2.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I haven't played it a lot yet, but so far, it is fun, slightly challenging without being frustrating for younger (or techno-challenged) folk. It's Minions...how can you not like it? ;)
B002MFULQO|5.0|goooooooooddddd<br /><br />can't believe JFK got kliddded by lots of people<br /><br />the warren commish is wrong. it's bad. the govt controls us.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham is such a wonderful writer you forget that he will take you on such a rollercoaster ride with so many twists and turns.  Such a fun read with a very unexpected ending.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am hooked on Lee Child's Jack Reacher, and the series of writings.  They are difficult to put down.
B00F88H5K2|2.0|Way overrated, because of the stars, not well done at all? Mediocre acting and story was wek. Rent something else
B00F5F0208|5.0|Drake has done it again! I've always been a fan and never has he disappointed me. &#34;Own it is one of my favorite tracks off the album. Although I love all of them!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I really enjoyed have this series so far. Beautiful setting, wonderful actors, entertaining dynamics among the characters. However at one point in the second season I did say to myself, 'really? all they do is prepare for and eat dinner?' That's their highlight of the day? hence the 4 instead of 5 star I guess. but still a good show.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|what you expected to hear with the return of Head. Couldn't ask for a better reunion album. The guitar's are on point. Lyrically just outstanding.  you can listen from beginning to end.
1419701533|5.0|I got the whole series - books 1-6 for her 8th birthday in August. She finished reading all of them in less than 3 days, and she has read each of the books at least 4 times since then.<br />I have not read any of the books, but from when she sometimes read out some funny parts, I take it that it is a fun and easy to read book.<br /><br />I will order the book 7 when it comes out.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|Anthony Hopkins!!! Crazy!!!.. terrifying!!! scary!!!!!..... He always does such a great job!! I couldnt imagine!!! an encounter with someone like this!! Great thriller!! I would reccomend this film to others!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this movie. but I found this movie very enjoyable. I should of known better than to doubt Disney. Disney does not make bad movies. the music is catchy and the story is pretty good and the acting is not bad. it's just a fun movie to watch if there is nothing else on and if you just want a cheerful film to watch. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This film was everything I expected! It was full of action, yet the kids can watch it!! I would suggest this film to others.
B00005JMX6|5.0|MOST OF THE THINGS i HAVE PURCHASED THROUGH amazon HAVE MET OR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. FAST AND EXPEDITIOUS SERVICE ALWAYS<br />...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Much easier to travel from chapter to chapter than other versions.  I just got it so I'm still getting acquainted to it.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is the most eloquent collection of Hawaiian standards I've owned... I love it and plan to give out as Christmas gifts.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I learned a lot about extroverts and introverts. Both teachers and employers should read it. I also realized I am not weird but just an introvert.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enjoyed the writing style, characters, and story.  Difficult to follow a few times at times with foreign names and languages.  Interesting to see storyline unfold.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Being a musical addict, I was REALLY looking forward to seeing how true they stayed to the live musical version of this, one of my favorite musicals.  And I was not disappointed!!!  This is truly what a musical lover wants to see, a movie that combines all of the best elements of the live musical, and the convenience of a movie experience, so beautifully that I can honestly say that this is my favorite movie adaptation of a musical!  Such a beautiful story, and I am so grateful they did this.  The only thing I didn't like is that they took out my favorite line in &#34;Rain Will Make the Flowers Grow&#34;.  But the rest of the movie is so amazing, I can forgive them for that!  :-)
B008JFUO72|4.0|I EXPECTED IRON MAN 3 TO BE BETTER THAN THE OTHERS.  IT WAS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THEN THE REST. BUT OVER ALL NOT THE TOP MOVIE OF THE YEAR..........................
B00BG08FKK|5.0|The entire cast did an amazing job here, singing beautifully, and the musicians as well were perfect in performing the score.  I love that they recorded the album while acting, because I feel it contributed to the actors' abilities to simply pump the songs with all the emotion they could hold.  I think I love this version of the musical even better than the original London cast!  It is my favorite musical right now.  :-)
B000AP04OM|4.0|I like the quality for the price. Besides the movie, it's nice to include the reunion of the characters at their present age. It's cool. I would recommend this to people I know.
B00973DDN2|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work by the Killers.  I've listened to it over and over.  And over!  I love this group, and they did an amazing job on this album.  :-)
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|movie starts off good,but there some scenes  did not care for.the movie had a good morale value such as remember those who have helped you along the way,
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Powerful, beautiful, BIG, luxurious, suspensful and a great place to run away to. Characters are each very deep and interesting to follow!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|still very good. Ending a bit cheesy, talking animals, too. Overall a fun point and click adventure. Definitely worth 0.99 cents.
B003S6T62Q|5.0|JOE IS INCREDIBLE. IF YOU LIKE ANY OF HIS MUSIC, YOU WILL LOVE THIS CONCERT!  HIS BAND IS ALSO VERY GOOD.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Compared to the first two movies this one didn't even compare. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie but it was definitely lacking in the comedy department . It had the potential to be so much funnier than what it was. Overall it was a good movie.
B005GT3XGS|5.0|I loved it. ra ra re kick em in the knee. ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Really loved this movie. I have to say that I liked everything about it, I found it to be very entertaining. Great movie for children and adults. Lots of funny parts. A must see!

B005LAIIN0|4.0|this moviw was great from start to finish it got right into the action and the stgory took off immidiately I really enjoyed this one... on with the sequel please!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I loved it. ra ra re kick em in the knee. ra ra ruts kick im in the other knee.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the best I have ever read about W W 'll  and I have read a lot of them.I started reading about that war when I was in High School
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case has stood the test of time. I purchased it along with a Kindle Fire for my mom (holiday gift), and it has been dropped, spilled on, and even chewed on by pets.. and there's hardly a scratch on it. My mom loved the pink color and how thin, yet durable this cover is.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Never crashes ,always reliable and kind of fun to see what the weather is doing where your loved ones are.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Great light read.  Read it from cover to cover the moment I picked it up.  Recommend for long trip. :-)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I absolutely LOOOOVE this game! Totally worth the $0.99!!!!!It was easy to get through,but WHO CARES?!?! I hope you'll get this game, definitely worth it!!!!!!!
B00005K3NR|5.0|I don't care how many times they try to make this movie over it will always be Sissy Spacek's movie.  She was great in the film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the best book i have ever read<br />it was so entertaining<br />it has action love pretty much everything a book should have
B002VWNIDG|5.0|I don't care what anybody says but Jack Nicholson made this movie.  The remake was a dud.  Jack makes a good &#34;HERE'S JOHNNY&#34; scene.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Thank you! I have fun with playing the game.<br />For free. I love having my kindle Plus having other things.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I haven't had a chance to see the program.  But, all my friends said it was a really good program and that I should watch it.  So going on all the praise it got I bought it.  Here's hoping it is as good as they say.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Thank you! I have fun with playing the game.<br />For free. I love having my kindle Plus having other things.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun and it is also addictive. plus when i play this game i just don't want to put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Everything about this game is awesome! Great graphics and I have not had any problems with it.  Game play is smooth and hasn't frozen.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Picked this game because it was the game of the day. It is such an addicting game, everyone should at least try it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game! You really should try it. Great way to pass the time. The game is intriguing. I love it.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|One of the best apps I have ever used. Flawless flipping, great stories. You can pick what you want to see, I highly recommend Flip Board to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Terrible book. Boring, not well written and a waste of time. It was also degrading to women. Lots of luck.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Pretty fun game, reminds me of Temple Run, fun game though. If you need a good time waster this is a good one.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|Bought it for one of my girlfriend's birthday presents. She asked me to watch it with her after she got it and it was ok. All I can really say. J-Law was good, Bradley Cooper was ok-good but that was it. I'll probably never watch it again but she liked it well-enough (had seen it before).
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Because it was funny,is creative,fun to read it is cute,it teaches how to get a date. It's also weird  to
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Seriously. Love it. Because of this app i can sideload videos via USB which I have digitally and watch them whenever and wherever I want. Not stuck with Amazon's catalogue or being forced to be connected to wifi is huge for me who wants things to watch when stuck in the car for a long time (I have to travel a lot). Also great (for when i'm driving and so I can't watch videos) is it plays audio files so I loaded up the audio book for A Storm of Swords and am still listening to it (34 discs is a lot of driving time). Again. Get this app. Love it.
1451627289|5.0|King at his best.  This one is a slight departure his usual horror theme, but it is a well thought out plot with many interesting characters.  I went through the 850 pages much faster than I thought I would.  Recommend to even non-King fans.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not as user friendly for apple users. Really limited at what you can do with it from and iOS device. I am sure in the near future it will have more capability with apple but at the moment it is seriously lacking.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I wish I had read the negative reviews before I bought this. I agree with them all. With the huge number of positive reviews, I thought that this must be a good book. What a laugh! I have learned a good lesson: don't trust Amazon reviews even when there are many.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|This moving was exciting and suspenseful . You could not always predict the next scene. It had a great storyline linked with the other Star Trek tv show . Worth watching!
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Who knew a Shyamalan movie would make me cry!?!  I found myself very involved at the beginning and end of this movie.  I read a book through some of the middle because it dragged on, but I really liked the movie. Oddly, reading a book didn't distract from me getting the full impact of the plot - hence my tears (don't assume what kind of tears I shed - could be sad, could be happy)<br /><br />I'd rent it again and watch it with friends and enjoy it.
B006JPML7K|4.0|The original Kung Fu Panda is definitely the original. However the second one was quite entertaining!<br />It was a little darker than the first, but my daughter adores the &#34;baby panda&#34; parts.<br />She's 2 and a half and it doesn't scare her. But Kung Fu Panda original is definitely the more watched of the two.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Currently running a competition with my son. Sorry to say I am losing for now. But we are having a blast and we are definitely not done yet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|There enough options available to allow you to customize the game to your preferences. I especially enjoy the option of dealing a winning hand when I 'm in the mood to really unwind.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Rosette Stone - muchas gracias!  It is fun and diverse enough to keep me on track.  One lesson per day.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Incredible fact and fiction of homeless children railed from New York to Chicago, Minnesota and points between to be taken in by families looking for a possible adoption, but mostly for free labor. Their treatment will shock you.
B001QB5S3G|3.0|The movie wasn't bad.  I was love movies set in the jungle but there was too much heavy drama for me.  If I was in the mood for a lot of drama I probably would've liked it more.
1400031524|2.0|I found this book slow, boring and tedious. The detective, Kurt Wallander, spends a lot of time having the feeling that something important was said and then thinking about what that might have been. Meanwhile, the author doesn't drop many clues for the reader and one cannot develop one's own theories about the crime. I gave up about 2/3 through the book.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Awesome read! I like reading from different points of views from the characters. The book is subtle and scary! Highly recommend
B00AW57L96|4.0|Kept me guessing and intrigued. A good read with a few twists and turns. An easy read. I want more...
B002QNTNL6|5.0|it was funny movie and show how important the relationship of father and daughter is, it is a very enjoyable for a family to watch.
B009R659L8|5.0|I am a fan of Mary Higgins Clark. She keeps one guessing until the end. Suspense, I do not read the last pages first. I read from front to back and am always surprised at the end and realize that clues have been become clearer but still surprised at the end<br />Hopefully, she will continue to write. Thank You Mary Higgins Clark!!!!!
B00FEJHPRI|5.0|I loved it! It was amazing! I can't wait for the next one! This movie is a must watch for fans!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very very nicely done. Fabulous deep and engaging plot, great character dynamics and development.  Period costumes are lovely and the perspective from that generation during this time period is fascinating. Highly recommend.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Love this game.  There is so much going on in this game.  I've only played it a handful of times but it is a great game.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I loved it.  I'm always amazed how people take to Jack. Alone in the dark doing it the hard way that's Jack
B008TMA1LY|5.0|My daughter is only 2, but she really loves the game.  I enjoy playing the game with her as well.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I love this show. For me a good show has to have great characters and this show never disappoints. My step-dad is a movie snob. He usually only watches &#34;films&#34; but he loves castle.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Simple and easy.  The info you want,  with no clutter. Multi locations with ease. I recommend this app for those who want their weather simple.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|The remaster definitely has a better sound than the original. Hard to explain sound but it seems a bit fuller and is easier to listen to. I am glad for that because I am one of those weird ones for whom this is their favorite Rush album.
0345803485|1.0|The worst book I have ever wasted my time on.  WHY is this thing popular?  I have seen better story structure from middle school students, Deserves MINUS 5 stars, but unable to do that.  What a sorry state of affairs that this thing is popular.  I can name 10 books off the top of my head that deserve the kind of attention this woeful thing attracted.  What a pity.
B00DJZR4A2|4.0|Really enjoying the new album. The last few EJ albums have been over-produced but this one sounds like a much more personal album and has a refreshing return to a real clean sound not so reliant on tons of layers of instruments and sound. It really is primarily EJ and piano with a few other things thrown in. That is all he needs to shine. Very happy with the album!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|My father was a B17 pilot flying out of England in 1944-5 so I knew about the life of bomber pilots but not the German side. This is well written, fast paced, and full of interesting facts. Highly recommend it.

B00EV6T6DQ|1.0|It's the first time I bought a comic on Amazon. I wanted to read the comic before watching the movie, and it was a terrible  choice to take the kindle format. The book is locked in portrait format and you can zoom on a frame by double tapping it. However, when you zoom, it crops some of the text... and so some text are unreadable. The zoom is useless if the frame is as wide as the page.

B000TEPKAW|5.0|One of the best albums ever made.  At the time it was a bit of a shock for long time Bowie fans.  It took a few listenings back then before I decided it was great.  Time has proved that the &#34;Berlin&#34; albums were some of the best work DB ever did.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Does anyone else experience technical difficulties with ads? I don't mind them cuz game is free but there is no menu option to skip them on some (most)  which forces me to click on them and then the app crashes. Anyone else have this problem? It's a huge bummer and nuisance. I have the Kindle Fire HD. Fix this problem please? Thanks!!
B009VMN3RA|1.0|If i could give it O stsrs I would. This book is trash. Ms.Parker trashed her Mother, Shirley Maclaine. Her father, Steve Parker, was trash. But Ms. Parker has used the fact she is Shirley Maclaine's daughter to get ahead in this world. She had no talent of her own so she blames Mom for all her problems. Don't waste your good money on this trash.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|Timely and instructive, Highlander offers a glimpse into a time when life around the lake was a universe unto itself. Each side considers the enemy 'filthy', to justify war. Good story and the beginning of a series that looks interesting.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Well its cheap, quiet, and keeps my i7 4770 @ 25c during idle. Installation was pretty easy, check out the youtube video if you have any doubts since the paper instructions are worthless. This is my second one, and its easy to recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for the whole family. My kids are in love with this game, super cute, lots of fun, easy to play and understand. Even my two year old can play.I wish the updates were available for the kindle as soon as they are for the cell phone. The game does have in app purchasing, so the parental controls are essential to keep the kids from draining your bank account with extras. You don't have to make purchases to advance andI greatly appreciate that! We highly recommend this game
0062073486|5.0|And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie was an easy book for me to choose because of the high praise it receives in any review you can find. As I read through this exciting novel, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, waiting to see what was going to happen next. The entire story kept me intrigued, and the mystery presented seemed to be one that is completely unsolvable. At first, all is well for the group of people who received summons to the mansion on Soldier Island. When people start to die, just as in the nursery rhyme Ten Little Soldiers, a copy of which hangs on the wall of every bedroom, things start to get interesting. The mystery of who is committing the murders and why seems to be one of an unsolvable nature keeping any reader's eyes glued to the pages to see what is going to happen next. This novel contains all the elements, from the twists and turns to the emotional ups and downs, of a perfect murder mystery novel. After experiencing the rollercoaster ride that this novel has to offer, I can say I would recommend anyone pick up this book and sit down for the ride of your life.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was eagerly waiting for this product to get back in stock to be able to buy it. I really love collecting such tech products (like a hobby!) but also to me chromecast showed a lot of future potential in it. unfortunately it didn't work for me!<br />As easy as it seems setting up this product gave me a hard time! Everytime I try to connect it with my home wifi, my wifi crashes and I don't see it among the network list until I restart my router again. tried several times using different devices (my windows laptop, android cellphone, an iphone) all with the same result. I called google play tech support they tried figuring out the problem while on the phone and they kept working on it with me on e-mails but nothing changed I even called my internet company who provided the router making sure about the router's default settings and we tried changing to several channels but still nothing worked.I eventually gave up and decided to return it.<br />I really hope google finds a solution for this problem soon because I really want to have it!<br />so in general if you like me have westell ultraline series3 router (provided by cincinnati bell) you probably won't be able to enjoy chromecast for now. btw my router never failed me in any of the other devices
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I liked the book, that's why I saw the movie.<br />As is often the case the movie isn't as good as the book.<br />Actually, the movie and the book are pretty much different stories except for their being zombies in the plot.<br />The movie is good though, enjoyable to watch, fun action.<br />Predictable, hollywood, cgi, action fun.

B00015YVD6|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out back in the 80's, and that has not changed.  It is a great story, and I would say a must have for everyone's collection.  The effects are not of modern caliber, but this is an 80's movie and were awesome at the time.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|This movie was not funny at all. Poor storyline and did not hold my attention. Very dissapointed compared to the first two.
6305428050|5.0|I had a blast watching this movie, and it was nice to reflect on how I have not changed much from when I like it as a kid.  It has all of the elements of classic 80's adventure comedy, and I think everyone did a great job with the movie.  Another classic for the collection in my opinion, so if you see it on sale, pick it up and have some fun.

0762777931|5.0|AMAZING!  I've tried a vegan diet in the past but burned-out after a couple of months. Finally, an amazing book that explains why a plant based diet is so important, but in a funny way. I absolutely Love Kris Carr and am so glad that I've found this amazing Goddess! I am day 3 into the cleanse and already feel like a brand new person...and it's easy! I purchased the Breville juicer and a bunch of veggies and, Ta-Da... Magic!  Pick it up and read it cover-to-cover. You will be so happy that you did.

B005OK722U|3.0|Hostel Part III (Scott Spiegel, 2011)<br /><br />Before I start dwelling on the bad things about this movie, which I'm relatively sure I will be doing by the third paragraph, I want to make something perfectly clear: I liked Hostel Part III way, way more than I expected to based on (a) Netflix user ratings, (b) the reviews I'd seen, and (c ) Hostel Part II. I am a big fan in general of movies that say “oh, hey, we've taken a look at the expectations you will have based on your viewing of the previous movies in the series, and we're going to write this script with every thought towards turning those ideas on their collective head.” Hostel Part III comes roaring out of the gate that way in the very first sequence, as we see country bumpkin Travis (Little Birds' Chris Coy—possibly playing to character, as IMDB notes he was born in Louisville, KY) stumbling into a room in a hotel already inhabited by a lovely Eastern European couple where the woman looks like a hooker and the guy like a thug. If you've seen the first two movies, this is obvious setup, but then screenwriter Michael D. Weiss, who specializes in bad sequels (I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer, Octopus 2: River of Fear), turns things around, and while this is a minor spoiler, the opening scene is mostly there for set decoration anyway—Travis is the hunter, the right-hand man of Flemming (Der Untergang's Thomas Kretschmann), the head of Elite Hunting Club's Las Vegas branch. Turns out Travis cleans up pretty nice.<br /><br />But that's not part of the actual plot, which involves Carter McMullen (Thirteen's Kip Pardue) hauling his best friend Scott (Client List's Brian Hallisay) off to Vegas for his bachelor party after assuring the fianc&eacute;e (Kelly Thiebaud, now a regular on General Hospital) that they're off for a weekend of golfing in Palm Springs. Once in the City that Never Sleeps, they hook up with two of their other friends, Justin (Shutter's John Hensley) and Mike (The Rules of Attraction's Skyler Stone), and the four of them get ready to party down with a number of lovely escorts, including Kendra (Whip It's Sarah Habel), who ends up having a deep and meaningful conversation with Scott after he decides he's going to stay faithful, they bond, blah blah blah, you know where all this is going.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily describe it as clever, but given my expectations given that it's a third movie in a series etc., it was far more intelligent than I thought it would be, pointed and fun and never forgetting that the backbone of the entire series is Eli Roth's very, very black sense of humor. But there were some things about it that range from just not ringing quite right—there seems as if there's going to be a romance subplot that just kind of withers on the vine, for example—to the outrageously awful (oh, that soundtrack). A computer crash just lost me the last paragraph and a half of this review and I'm too frustrated to retype it all (not to mention I'd written it in fits and starts over the course of the previous hour—the irony is that LibreOffice's autobackup procedure is what caused the crash in the first place), so the short answer: the stuff I've been harping on in this paragraph, which is annoying and often beggars suspension of disbelief, is still not enough to say “avoid this” if you were a fan of the first film; Spiegel (From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money) is certainly no Eli Roth, but go into this with low expectations and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. ** ½n's Skyler Stone), and the four of them get ready to party down with a number of lovely escorts, including Kendra (Whip It's Sarah Habel), who ends up having a deep and meaningful conversation with Scott after he decides he's going to stay faithful, they bond, blah blah blah, you know where all this is going.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily describe it as clever, but given my expectations given that it's a third movie in a series etc., it was far more intelligent than I thought it would be, pointed and fun and never forgetting that the backbone of the entire series is Eli Roth's very, very black sense of humor.

B0030T1NAO|5.0|Excellent sophomore season! Ordered season 3 before even watching it! I highly recommend this series to any and all adults.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does as advertised.  Great for people that have friends and family over who like to share things ( music, video, photos ) on the big screen instead of the pocket screen.  No passwords needed.  Would recommend for everyone. Great to bring on trips so you can use the hotel tv to view your content and not their basic cable plus HBO package.
B005LAIIGM|3.0|Heading into the theater to see this movie, I thought that it was going to be a great experience.  I had heard high praise from friends, it fits neatly into my favorite genre of movies (science fiction/drama), and it just looked like a really, really cool concept.  Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling ambivalent.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, \\"Gravity\\" tells the story of two astronauts who are stranded in space after a freak satellite accident pummels their shuttle and sends them both adrift.  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is the cool, cocky, non-stop energy personality, while Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is the nervous, scared, out-of-her-element type.  They must somehow find a way to survive in the vacuum of space while planning a return journey to Earth.<br /><br />I will say this about \\"Gravity\\": the visuals are absolutely astonishing.  It really makes you feel as if you are in space with the two astronauts.  I didn't even see it in IMAX, but I can imagine that would be even a more visceral experience.<br /><br />The trouble for me, however, is that I felt that the plot/characters were never really developed enough to truly care when it all starts to come together in the end.  It almost seemed as if director Alfonso Cuaron tried to tackle too many things at once and didn't really \\"nail\\" any of them.  There were shades of horror, suspense, drama, reality, and even humor sprinkled into the experience, but in the end I just didn't feel the emotion that is needed for such a character-driven film like this one to be considered great.<br /><br />Thus, aside from the spectacular visuals, I was disappointed with \\"Gravity\\".  It isn't a \\"bad\\" movie, per se, so three stars are in order, but 2.5 would be my more exact ranking.  It just never sucked me into the plot or characters.

B00E0G5U4G|5.0|This band is one of my favorite. I started with Reek of Putrefaction and followed them as they matured their sound into something amazing. I was lucky to see them in concert with Napalm Death in Hollywood back in the 90's. Their last album was truly a \\"Swansong\\". It was bad in many ways. It was missing the fast drums and guitar riffs from previous tracks. It felt lazy and cheap. It was sad when that was their last album in years. Surgical Steel shows they still got it. I would describe Surgical Steel as a mix of Necroticism - Descanting the Insalubrious and Heartwork. They went back to the sound that made them one of the greats. I highly recommend Surgical Steel to old school Carcass fans and new comers to the genre. I still consider Carcass as a Grindcore band. There are so many sub genres that it's ridiculous. With that being said, Carcass is one of the best Grindcore bands in my opinion.

It is very detailed and not only reviews how to take care of curly hair but to embrace it and love it. The author is knowledgable and speaks from first hand experience and years of research and development. Her writining style and humor helps move forward through the book during the step by step parts that can often be dry.(There is a DVD too that is helpful which shows how to wash, dry, manage, and treat different types of curly hair) It is easy to read and follow and is a must read for anyone with curly hair. Quit fighting it and embrace your curls!! You will be glad you did.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|Also, passionless, humorless, and colorless -- figuratively and literally in the case of the latter.<br /><br />I expected to love this movie and I was stunned by how awful it is. Benedick and Beatrice are painfully miscast and everyone is walking around in a daze mumbling.<br /><br />The only bright spots for me were Clark Gregg as Leonato and Sean Maher as Don John. Maher should play more villains because he is great at it.

0812983459|1.0|what a let-down...this was a selection for my book club, otherwise i would not have finished it...what a bore...a totally impractical idiot of a man, walking off, on what he perceives as a \\"mission\\", to a person who saved his bacon 20 years earlier, but whom he has not seen, contacted or even thought of since then...no, not possible...he does not even have enough sense to wear good socks and shoes, and he is going to walk 627 miles...nah, stupid...i put on sensible socks and shoes just walking my dog and i am a lot older than this character...the back story was so obvious; the sad death of the only son was flagged very early, and all the agony, self-blame, guilt and regrets came pouring out at the very end of the text...poor pacing, poor character development, poor secondary characters, poor descriptions of settings, mood, staging and surroundings....it read like a \\"confession magazine\\" story...\\"my deep dark secret which has made me miserable for 20 years\\"...well, yes, a child's suicide would do that, but a long walk in inadequate equipment, to the bedside of an old acquaintance, does not make it better...none of my book club members liked it, they all thought it shallow, sentimental, and dumb...so do i...as for parallels to \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\"...i have never been able to read that whole text,even tho it features prominently in \\"Little Women\\"...so i cannot make an educated comparison...and i am not tempted to try....all in all, a disappointment...i am glad i bought it cheaply, used...off to the charity shop it goes...

B00A6CCF0K|2.0|First of all, let it be said that I am a fan of Stephen King. I've read his books, and always look forward to his next one. With that being said, Doctor Sleep was a release I anxiously awaited, and I bought it the first day. Upon finishing it, I realized that there was no fear in this book, aside from the terror of realizing that my favorite novel, The Shining, had been tied to this weak story.<br />I am not a writer, so for me to critique one, is incorrect. However, as a reader, I can tell you that I was disappointed early in the book when I saw how this was tied to the original, and upon finishing it, realized I can't get that time back.<br />The Shining was Gothic Horror, putting the reader in the halls of the Overlook, it's sense of pending doom constantly chasing you. This book simply is not a good story, not a scary story, and a huge disappointment.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|There are so many great songs on this album, not just Royals. You'll definitely enjoy discovering the other gems. Love it!!!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Fast shipping. Arrived in condition indicated in descrition. Great movie! Touching, realistic (which is good since its a true story), great acting by all. Tearjerker in some scenes.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Love this show. It's entertaining and throws in life's lessons along the way. I love all the characters too. I think they are perfectly cast. Finn was my favorite.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|This was a fun game, I made it to the &#34;top of the mountain&#34; but now there is nothing more to do except start over.<br />I would recommend it for free but I wouldn't spend any money or coins as there are no upgrades that I can see.
B00BJS7104|5.0|I just loved this movie when I watched it at the theater and is one I knew I could find at Amazon.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|This movie is hysterical.  I laughed from the beginning to the end.  What a great way to spend some time.
B00F35BV64|4.0|It was good, maybe not as good as the first one by J.J. Abrams, but still a good story!  Yeh
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Self-important, quasi-spiritual, bogus mysticism, wrapped in a bundle of CGI. Valuable as a demonstration of available film technology. Of no lasting value as drama.
B003BVFZ4Q|4.0|I have read many books in writing seeking to improve my own work. Steven King's book is different from all the others. He tells stories of his life, and why that had the effect on his work. Sometimes he gives us these facts openly, other times it is implied so that the reader reaches a conclusion later. My only criticism is that the stories, at times, go on a little too long. That aside I would recommend this book to any writer, whether published or not, if only to get an incite into one of the world's most successful authors.
B00D82BNLC|4.0|This book was very enjoyable! Love listening to these types of shows on TV and reading books about Paranormal Investigation. Enjoyed following the team into the hospital and picturing in my mind's eye what was happening.<br /><br />The only thing that I wished that author had done was to take time to go into a little more detail; for example, the equipment they used, how she picked her team and what happened to the guy that was in the hospital? Seems like he was just forgotten. I hope the author writes more of these books and includes updates on places and people. I will definitly read them!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a brillant game because it dosent cost any money.it never clashes in between the game.so it is amazing!!!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|The book is great and I love the detail. You can certainly envision yourself right there alongside her. I will say I do like the comical edge of the show though.
B00FAXLCWW|4.0|The vocal style is different and refreshing.  The melodies are good but without the style points they would fall flat.
B003QS9WIE|3.0|The last scene where jackman talks about magic is hilarious. I wish there was not a seven teen word limit.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Historically very interesting & great to go on a tour un the UK & visit the castles described. Highly recommended.
B00BCCE3VM|5.0|This album is not a collection of fast and loud, perfectly executed virtuosic warhorses, which is how Chopin's études are usually treated. Rather, it is an epic musical journey that explores the gamut of human emotion, from playful wittiness to tragedy and despair. Lisiecki's approach to these opuses is truly unique and special, making it an essential addition to any serious music lover's collection. Simply put, these are the most musically sensitive, honest, and profound recordings of the Chopin Études that I have ever heard. Bravo!
B00D3V97DO|3.0|I learned to play guitar listening to Tony and Black Sabbath so I was really excited about &#34;13&#34;. In the end there are some really good songs here, and Tony proves again that he is the riff master. I have two main complaints that keep me from loving it:<br /><br />1) My first complaint is purely subjective. To me, the album as a whole sounds like Black Sabbath trying really hard to sound like Black Sabbath. The opening track feels very much like &#34;Black Sabbath&#34; the song which opens the first album. &#34;Zeitgeist&#34;=&#34;Planet Caravan&#34;.<br /><br />2) I was disappointed that &#34;Psycho Man&#34; and &#34;Selling My Soul&#34;, two great studio songs that were included on the 1998 &#34;Reunion&#34; live album, weren't included on &#34;13&#34;. I think a lot of folks missed those two songs because they came with the live album and they are worhty of being included on a studio album. They are certainly as good as anything else on &#34;13&#34;.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I had heard that the author was very bood, so I purchased this book.  It was so bad I could not even finish it.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|Not my favorite QotSA album, but it does grow on you. On first listen I found myself a little disappointed, but after a few session of listening beginning to end I found that it really started to like it. In fact &#34;I Sat By the Ocean&#34; has caused me to lose no small amount of sleep as I sing it to myself over and over lying in bed, but in a good way! :-)
B0054EU0H0|5.0|This screen protector fits onto the camera screen perfectly and it was very easy to apply. I haven't really done much to put the screen and the protector in danger, so I am not sure on if it works really well, either that it works great and I haven't noticed it because it did a great job. But it sure keeps the dust away from the screen!
B000AO4NJA|5.0|I cannot locate the one Sam Cooke album - in CD form - that I enjoyed so much in my youth..but this one that I did locate is priceless. Thank you for the continuous love I have for Sam Cooke!  Fast delivery..Great Price!
B00FGEO9NE|1.0|Complain to Showtime lol.  Amazon just sells the product.  I would agree that the first two episodes were no good in my opinion.  Hopefully this series doesn't die like 24 did.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very ingenious story with a logical plot progression. The characters are well developed and intriguing. I hope he continues following the story in later books.
B0064MGU98|4.0|i watched this while i was on maternity leave breastfeeding my first child, perfect for zoning out.  wonderful brainless entertainment.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I have only found this game on consoles. If I could find it for pc especially with a light gun, I would buy it in a heartbeat. Why haven't developers marketed one?
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Just adding my two cents here but Jaden Smith has got to be one of the worst actors in the movies today.  He lacks any of the charm and charisma his father possesses and he simply just cannot act.  The fact that he has gotten a role in such a big-budget film is purely through nepotism.  And let us not forget that the script was horrible as well.  This was such a patchwork of other films (better films) that I'm surprised that the film company hasn't been sued yet.<br /><br />Watch the movie for yourself and you decide, or better yet don't pay that boy any money and don't watch it.  He needs to find a nice job at the mall, because that is where I would expect his level of talent, maturity, and skill to be found.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|And that's how I was really hoping they'd play this one, with a dry, macabre sense of humor.  Instead it lurches back and forth between silly and scary, so you really never know whether to laugh or not. Overall I'd say it was a parody of soap operas, just not an especially funny one.
B00B1TJO10|5.0|Best book on statistics and SPSS! A must for researchers, its funny, smart and it will help you very much!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|You may read this as though I'm a Trek fan or I'm not. I don't care.<br /><br />The movie itself is easily a 5 star rating. Perhaps sequel isn't precisely the right word for this. In any event, this is one of those rare sequels that is the equal of it's predecessor (predecessors?). I won't go any further into reviewing the movie except to say that I enjoyed it immensely. Star Trek, regardless of which generation, is one of those things that people will either watch or they won't. No amount of glowing reviews will change that.<br /><br />Video: Excellent. 5 stars, hands down. I watched this twice on my 55\\" Samsung 8000 series LED TV. There is absolutely nothing to distract. No banding, artifacting, etc. This is as perfect an image as possible, short of actually being in the movie. I do not give such ratings lightly, when it comes to video or audio quality. I am generally very unforgiving, when it comes to that sort of thing. Video wise, this is a perfect Bluray.<br /><br />(And yes, the lens flares are in this one too. Get over it.)<br /><br />Audio: Fair ...at best. 3 stars. Played through an Onkyo 7.2 receiver powering Definitive Technology speakers. 7006's (built in 300W subs) as mains. A BP8 as a center channel, and 4 350's as side and rear channels. I mention all that because these are excellent speakers (merely a good receiver) and you need to know where I'm coming from and why I rated the audio so poorly. The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track is only okay. Bass is mostly fine. There are a very few slightly weak points but nothing troubling. That's not to say the bass is fantastic either. It's quite good but never hits that level of true awesomeness that I expected from this movie. The mids and highs are simply fall down dead. Weak, anemic, and lame all come to mind as good adjectives. There is a lot of audio surround going on. Phasers, explosions, and such in front, to the side and behind. Stuff whizzing by. It's wild and chaotic and it's supposed to be. The problem is it sounds like hell. The mids and highs both sound flat and utterly lacking in any clarity. I even turned the volume WWWWAAAAAYYYYYY up for a time to really, really listen. The goodness just isn't there. Even in the fairly subdued scenes (few as they are), there's a fair amount of background audio going on. It sounds slightly muffled and it's somewhat difficult to discern to the point of being quite distracting. The dialog suffers all of the same issues as the rest of the track. Flat and empty. It never gets to the point of indecipherable which I suppose is a plus. Although I did have to turn my center level up much higher than I normally keep it. +12 dB instead +2dB. I'd almost say the audio track is lossy but I didn't hear any of the tell tale slight warble or tinniness that comes with compressed audio. Still, I'm not convinced it isn't lossy. Honestly, I think the culprit here is Dolby True-HD and bad mastering. I strongly suspect this would have been a 5 star track, if it had been DTS-HD Master.<br /><br />Having given the audio as much of a thrashing as I just did (told you I was unforgiving), you will now likely be surprised to find that I haven't gotten to the critical flaw I mentioned in my title. Here it is. The audio is out of sync with the video. This is absolutely, 100% UNFORGIVABLE! That goes for any movie, of course, but especially for one of this pedigree. It gets worse. Okay so any halfway decent Home Theater setup can delay the audio to make it sync up. That's the thing, I couldn't fix it. My receiver can set a delay in 10 ms increments. 20 isn't enough and 30 is ever so slightly too much.<br /><br />There's no excuse for this. Paramount ruined an otherwise great movie experience with a hack job on the audio in their rush to get the disc on shelves so they could dive into additional profits like Scrooge McDuck.  I'm terribly disappointed with this audio. If I find a Bluray with DTS-HD audio then this copy will immediately become my new beer coaster. Thanks Paramount. <--- That sentence is known as sarcasm. I will never pre-order a movie again.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Well i thought it was a good game but i was annoyed about on the main menu it would interrupt me and say you are about to delete all items but other than that it was good.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's cool so far. The graphics are good. Loads fast. Haven't had much time to play it cause I  just got it 5 minutes ago. Did the tutorial now they want me to review it with basically no info. So it's good so far. Just free why not get it if you like deer hunter?
B0091KB6TY|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book about six months ago for the first time and then requested it again at the library and I received the 15th anniversary edition and now I want to purchase this edition for myself. The art inside the book is quite beautiful. The way the book is put together gives such a pleasant experience. The message is the same and I think reading it in this beautiful edition makes a bigger impact.
B00CC9P99E|4.0|You can't go wrong with a Lloyd Cole CD!  Ok maybe you can, the new one with Rhodeous isn't very good, but on his own he is very good, and on Standards he is excellent!  If you are a long time Lloyd fan or just getting started with him, this is a good one!  He is way too overlooked, shine the spotlight on Lloyd Cole!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I liked this movie. Good acting and a few surprises along the way. I would recommend this movie. It was better than I expected.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Harry Nilsson was one of the great American songwriters, his songs are masterpieces and he had a voice that was a gift from above.  This set chronicles the rise and fall of a true American original.  There are 17 disks in this set all 14 albums that Harry recorded for RCA and 3 disks of bonus material.  But that isn't all, each disk has a wealth of bonus material, the first 3 albums have the original album in mono and stereo plus a few bonus tracks, some of the songs are sung in Italian.  The CD's are issued in the mini LP sleeve which means that yes you will have to get out the magnifying glass to read anything on it.  There is a good book that comes with the set that has the track list for each CD.  There is little else in the booklet however, which makes this the sets weak link.  There is little to tell the story of Harry.
B00FEN1C50|2.0|Acting was so horrible it almost ruined the entire movie. Its best to watch this movie with the sound turned off.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|This take two of Steven Stills Super Session shows Steven and Barry Goldbeg both from SS1 in good form, joined by the remarkable Kenny Wayne Shepard, this album tends towards the blues, and the songwriting is first rate and just a fun album to listen to.  Whether they continue this or go their separate ways, they left this document of 3 great musicians doing what they do best!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love being able to start watching this show from the beginning! So many great characters -- love the drama! Good video quality as well on the iPad and my computer.

B0044DEAUA|4.0|D Pesce<br /><br />Works great for the price. I've  had it for over a month and have no major issues.  It has a good range so I do make sure I turn it off in my driveway because it will pick up my cell phone in the house.  For the money I can't complain.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|READING THIS BOOK IS A GREAT EYE-OPENER FOR ANYONE.<br />RELIGIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD REGARD THIS BOOK AS<br />REQUIRED READING.  IT SHOWS THE FAIRY-TALE STORIES<br />IN THE BIBLE.  HE IS RIGHT.  GOD IS A DELUSION.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I'm a Star Trek fan from it's first TV series years ago, and this movie is very good. Done well and the action is intense. The way they incorporated the original personalities of the first characters into these actors was very good as well.
0486278077|4.0|In a seductive yet cautionary tale, of a young artist, a beautiful man and a man whom embodies corruption in a human form; the Picture of Dorian Grey is one such tale that depicts vanity, corruption and darkness. On a fateful night at a party Basil Hallward, is entranced by the beautiful and captivating Dorian Grey, a kind hearted lad new to the land, as Basil is finishing his most recent portrait of Dorian, it is then that Dorian is introduced and thrown into a new world entirely, a world of sin, lust and vanity. It is then that Dorian sells his soul to stay forever young, the only age and wear that shows appears on the painting.<br /><br />The novel is sophisticatedly written, Wilde has a way of turning words into beautiful paintings such ones that can be imagined by Basil in the novel. In this dark tale, it's not hard to see why it is still considered a classic, it's thought provoking, intriguing with such themes as sin and lust; the simple idea of a man selling his soul to be forever young is an interesting concept alone, but with Wilde's wit, and deep imagery this novel has been passed down for years.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book, if you can handle difficult vocabulary and can get passed the somewhat crude content, then this is the book for you.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|It did not load properly and I am going to have to take it off my tablet. I was very disappointed because it loaded great on my phone but not my tablet.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|way better than 50 shades. This is much better written and is more realistic than 50 shades. I hope they make a movie for this one too
B001F12J0C|5.0|Because I enjoy action movies and this is awesome. The story line was also very intense and well done. I would recommend this movie.

B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Kojima's great works. I recommend this game since the story and action is awesome. Expecting new Metal Gear series now
193413712X|3.0|Basically a beautifully written poem about the slow art of dying. I don't recommend it if you're looking for plot driven fiction. If you enjoy a canopy of words eloquently interlocked, check it out. I could say more, but I've probably said enough.
B00821BLX4|4.0|I know the camera is tough but I want to protect the lens in the outdoors and this adapter allows for a 40.5mm clear or polarized lens filter that essentially protects your lens.  It also comes with a lens caps which further protects.  Good value and sound piece of mine protecting your investment.
0307740919|5.0|The divine Toni Morrison has been giving us shorter novels to enjoy lately.  As with A Mercy, Home comes in at an unintimidating page count.  But in this novel, in addition to brevity (it can easily be read over the course of a day if you have some spare time) we are also gifted with greater accessibility.  Many non-book readers, and non literary fiction readers, steer clear of Toni Morrison because her exquisite use of language does not make for light reading.  Her poetic verse can be challenging to those unable/unwilling to sit still and focus.  If you have been avoiding her magnificent body of work for these reasons, avoid no more.  Home is the book for you.  Morrison's prose, which remains as lush and eloquent as ever, is more straight forward here than in her previous books.  Faithful fans will get their fill and I encourage new ones to jump on board.  Just don't expect a leisurely beach read.  She hasn't gone quite that far.  A synopsis comes easily, contained in one sentence.  A veteran of the Korean War, haunted by blood soaked memories of his time there, returns to his hometown in Georgia to rescue his ailing sister.  Along the way, Toni Morrison paints the backdrop of their lives.  Cee has spent the majority of hers dependent on the kindness or lack of it displayed by those she encounters via circumstance.  Frank comes back to save her life, but in order to claim and do something of worth with it, Cee realizes she must develop her own inner strength.  Frank is wrestling too many demons to always reliably be her hero.  Much has changed over the course of the years since Frank last set foot in the town where they were raised.  Plenty remains more or less the same.  Home is there to provide familiar comforts, even though our return to it is inevitably in the form of a different version of ourselves.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Entertaining and Adicting.  Easy to catch on but difficult to put down. Great for young and old. Cant wait to get back to the game.
0061692042|3.0|Richard Ford takes his sweet time building up to the details of events that he reveals at the very beginning of this novel.  The leisurely trips to \\"the bank robbery\\" and then a much shorter one to \\"the murders\\" are enjoyed because of Ford's masterly, non-pretentious use of language. This book isn't about crime and/or punishment. Despite the title it isn't even about Canada. It's simply a story about making due with what you have, moving on from what takes place, looking back on what once was, ever watchful for what may come to be. Canada is a chronicle of what happens to every single one of us. Life.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Fun movie woth good feelings generated within the film and for us the audience. No one gets killed!<br />Story fairly typical of rediscovered love in late life but nice to see it happen. music uplifting and enjoyable. People who have been or are professional musicians  play in their own genre. Beautiful scenery. An evening entertainment.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown delivers again. I've enjoyed each of his Robert Langdon thrillers and hope he keeps them coming. He's a master at pacing, never a dull moment even as he bombards the reader with easy to digest information about symbols, religion, science, architecture, etc. Is it formulaic fiction? Certainly. Writing of the highest literary caliber? Certainly not. But as any baby will tell you, when formula is created just right it will be lapped up eagerly. One emerges from a Dan Brown caper feeling that a few new things have been learned in the process of being thoroughly entertained. Works for me. When I'm in the mood for a genre read I feel confident that Dan Brown won't steer me wrong. The Lost Symbol is the latest piece of evidence that he does what he does particularly well.
B00CDXOXB4|1.0|Just when you think Sparks can't get any sappier, he does. This movie is squishily, squirmingly awful, so bad it forces me to make up new words. And if you don't get the the so-called &#34;mystery&#34; after about 20 minutes into it you haven't seen a Sparks movie before. It gets one star for great scenery - the only real reason to watch it is to get lost in a pretty beach town for awhile. Julianne Hough is apparently a dancer, not an actress. There is a reason for this. Josh Duhamel is handsome and sweet in all the right places, definitely a big part of the &#34;great scenery&#34; that makes this worth watching, if you are lying on the couch recovering from outpatient surgery, as I am. If you like your summer beach romances with extra saccharine, watching perfect people with perfect bodies behave perfectly, this is the movie for you.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It's the ULTIMATE help and support for learning to publish on Kindle - one simply has to follow it carefully, step-by-step, and one's away!  I have been relieved and delighted to use it as a friendly, encouraging reference book.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Aslan's use of historical sources demonstrates in so many ways that the writers of New Testament Gospels presented a Jesus who was Messiah by creating stories and myths that were far from true or possible.  His descriptiion of how the concepts and theology of Paul came to be official doctrine after conflict with Jesus' brother James and Peter emphasizes the direction the Christian church took in the first through the fourth centuries of the Common Era.  I found the book interesting and a good read, but it fit into my own ideas that disputes in those centuries were resolved in ways that Jesus probably never imagined.  But I don't think that Aslan made a strong case that Jesus fit the description of a Zealot in a struggle against Rome or its Jewish supporters.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|This novel is so strange and unusual that it is hard to know what to think of it. I'm sure the reality of life in North Korea is bizarre, so I'm left wondering what the truth of the story is and what isn't. The book actually asks what is truth and refers to the lies we tell ourselves to make our way through our lives. Those questions about life apply to everyone, although for the characters in this book life in North Korea is built on lie upon lie upon lie. It is a disturbing story but difficult to put down. Not for those looking for a light hearted read, but it will be one of the most memorable books of my life.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Just okay. Read the first two books, which I enjoyed, but felt it was stretching the same old story line.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Enjoyed reading this novel so much that I actually bought the series. Romance overcoming the villain and the family was warm and endearing.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I'm glad I decided to pick this book up to read after a friend refereed it to me. A truly astonishing story from a brave man!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Got through it in a few hours. Dragged in a few spots, but overall great story. Made me want to see the movie.
B000KJU182|5.0|My mom really liked it. She has me get a few of these older movies a year for her. Thanks.
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|i never was into Natalia..but after sampling her album on itunes,i started loving her..this album is great..on itunes,this album was 6.99..i bought it but im also gonna order the cd here on amazon just to have it in my collection.im gonna check out her old stuff..overall this album is just perfected..i have it on repeat.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed it<br />Really makes you think. Can be frustrating a t times.<br />You have . Numbers different shapes<br />Would b nice to offer clues though
1250012570|5.0|This is a terrific, touching book about first love with interesting, complicated likable characters. Also some horrible characters. I loved Eleanor and Park.  They seemed like real people to me. This book is tender and sweet, but also terrifying in parts.  Highly recommended for teens and adults. I usually don't like romance stories, but this one has so much to offer.
0439023513|5.0|I bought this to replace a copy I had given away.  I love the Hunger Games books and discover new nuances each time I read them - which is often.  The subtle allegory, the colorful and very human characters, are compelling.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|I use this album to work with it in the background.It has no vocals yet can take your mind on a journey.These guys have a vast imagination and are very good songwriters.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|An excellent sports - adventure film based on real events.  I'm a Gerard Butler fan so I am biased, but the photography is fantastic, the surfing scenes are glorious.  I always wished I could surf.  Unfortunately, I lack the balance and strength required to surf at least when I tried it.  Of course I was 50 when I made my attempt so that could account for some of the lack of strength.  If you enjoy sports movies, the ocean, adventure, and/or surfing - you'll love this film.
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|Can Korn actually be getting more mellow with age.It sure seems like it.This album to awhile to grow on me.It is not as heavy as their other stuff yet still very good.Not what you would expect from them but Korn never really has fit the same mold twice.That is what makes them great.Nobody does it like Korn.Still it is actually a refreshing change from their last couple of records.Just don't expect to crank every song.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent TV drama, Good subject matter, great dialogue and intelligent plots. The characters seem like real life people,complex and interesting.
B00B6SI7TG|4.0|The typical stuff from one of the world's most under-rated groups.It has plenty of different sounds to enjoy.Nothing beats the original though.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Excellent TV drama, Good subject matter, great dialogue and intelligent plots. The characters seem like real life people,complex and interesting.
B00FDSV4TA|4.0|The addition of Bennington added a different element to the mix.His vocals are well suited to this band.The music is just as good as their old stuff yet with nice surprises in them.The music is always well written and has good vibes.Nothing will ever touch the 1st album but this is more than equal to their other effort.It is worth it if you love this band as I do.Keep on rocking boys.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A lot like missile command. Good game. Takes fast reflexes on higher levels. Great way to pass an hour or two.  Lots of fun.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The pace of the movie was too slow for my taste. The movie has wonderful actors and the setting and the idea was original yet it didn't deliver at the end.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Long time Alter Bridge Fan Here.  Fortress is a truly epic album.  Standouts include Cry of Achilles, Fortress, Calm the Fire, Lover, Cry a River, All Ends Well, Waters Rising, Peace is Broken, the Uninvited, Belled it Dry.  Really, there isn't a song I could call bad or unlikeable on this album.<br /><br />The riffing on calm the fire, peace is broken, Bleed it Dry, the Uninvited, Cry of Achilles, and Addicted to Pain is pulsating stuff.  This Tremonti guitarist guy, who is he?  (Just joking of course).  My only gripe... waiting three years for a new AB album.  But it's here, and thank for the Rock Gods.<br /><br />Ok, Fortress is a unique mix of thrash, modern rock, double base, and metal riffs over soaring vocals, and intense solos.  No one truly does it like AB, and this record emphasizes the harder melodic elements of their repertoire.  Fantastic, and unique offering, and a definite must have.  Great stuff
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What  a great read from beginning to end. I am so picky about books and if I'm not into it by page 2 I'm done. I couldn't guess what was going  to happen nor did I want to
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This movie is great and gives a different take on individuals with mental illness, especially since they are often stigmatized very negatively.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Chosen and made for computer repair.  What else can I say?  9 more words is what.  I don't regret spending for this.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Very nice app. Doesn't have tons of customization options which makes it very clean and simple. I have tried accuweather, weather bug, and even weather.com but this app was the best. .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again, loved the story line. Book was better than the movie and movie was great too
B007SGM084|5.0|whoa baby.  Got better and better with each book. Love Christian Grey and cant wait for the movie to be made.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This is the only Nicholas Sparks book that I have not recomended as a must read.  I am considering reading it again to see if it is better the second time.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Poignant story, not at all as I expected, but loved it in the end.  Hard to stay focused through the middle of story, lengthy read.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|It is pretty good I like how it is set up! But i don't like how it shows up on your on going on a kindle fire.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great You need to read all 3 books and get the full story in detail. Book is always better than the movie.
B004A8ZWWY|1.0|I really expected this film to be funny and good. I hung in there thinking some actual laughs would come during the heist portion of the film which took forever to come. Eddie Murphy doing his same old schtick and Ben Stiller as flat as possible left me expressionless. Also, were the film makers freakin kidding me with Matthew Broderick. The guy looked half dead and uttered words that looked like some untalented schleps first audition.<br /><br />Toss in a depressing ultra straight portrayal by Alan Alda to secure the fate of this bomb. The film was trying to be outrageous to the point of distraction on one end while not knowing where else it wanted to go with the serious elements . I cringed at the dialogue.<br /><br />A heist comedy with this kind of talent should have sailed. The only standout was Gabourey Sidibe. Her scene with Murphy where she asks if he's married was funny. Why couldn't more of that have been there? So much lost potential.<br /><br />It just didn't work, period. Glad I didn't pay for the rental as I would have done when the film was first released.
B00AYB0YFQ|4.0|It was a good movie. Play back was good and no commercials. It was not censored or anything it was the full movie
B00000IQW5|5.0|I LOVE this movie, but it has special meaning for me.  I've seen it several times and wanted to add it to my collection.
B004ZH66XO|1.0|Have not heard of this & don't recall downloading.<br />Did you know Amazon does this bait & switch sort of think with the discounts for applying for an Amazon card?
0783230079|5.0|Looking forward to watching this movie soon.  I heard it was great from someone who has seen it many times.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|My first smart phone was a Samsung Charge and it came with SWIPE installed and I loved that app too... So when I got my DROID RAZR Maxx HD I was bummed to find nothing like SWIPE...  Then I found SwiftKey... i happy... ;)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever.I love how you can buy diffrent levels,costumes,powerups and more.This is definetly my favorite game of all time.Here are some other reasons why I like this game.The despicable bonuses,free daily tokens,funny costumes and free powerups.I would definetly recomend this game to a friend
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Great story that tells the tale of teenagers falling in love and going through the trials and tribulations of cancer.  My only complaint is that some of the words used in this book are, for lack of a better word, confusing.  As an adult, I had to find definitions to understand what they were talking about.  I can't imagine teenagers/young adults know/knew the meanings.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Timeless classic-a great read! I regret that I didn't dive into Sherlock at an earlier age. This edition is wonderful-the complete collection with some great illustrations.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite, makes me feel good movie. It's even better that it's based off of a true story. Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses too. I recommend this movie.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies. I laughed through the whole thing. They don't make movies like this anymore.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|One of my favorite games now on my tablet. I really enjoy playing but I don't understand how you can have levels based on your experience and wins if the game is based on what type of cards you have. Also, how do I play with friends ?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Every page I read I told myself one more page but  if I couldn't stop reading! The story starts off a little confusing but once you catch up its so creative!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have not had any problems with the game, and I really like this game. It is the only game on my kindle that I give a 5 star to.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Honestly, I devoured Ms. Harris's other novels--but this one seemed a little flat.  If you want to put it in vampire terms--it would be like putting a body through a wringer to get every last drop of blood out of it--whether it tastes good or not.  Unfortunately, that is the way of things sometimes when someone is trying to wrap up a popular series that they really just don't have any material left for--or have material for--but no longer desire to write it.  I think that she probably could have made the book before this one a tad longer, and included a lot of the information that was in this book with that one and it would have made for a better story.  Instead--well...instead we get a book of tying up loose ends to make everyone happy--I guess?  I think she was trying to make the publisher happy by squeezing out one last book—and now I see that there is still another book to tie up even more loose ends (After Dead).  Why?  That was what this book did--how could there be more?  Anyway, I loved the books up until this one--and it's not because I didn't like the way it turned out.  It was because I knew before it was even published how it would turn out because Deadlocked pretty much brought us all to that conclusion.  Now if only she could tell the screen writers of the True Blood series to stop screwing up her stories...
B00915G6MG|5.0|i Loved it, cant get enough of NCIS. It just gets better every season. cant wait for the next season now.
0307744434|3.0|the book came highly recommended but i find it not that great. it is an ok read but i could not really say i truly enjoyed it
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Wonderful music! Great story! Delightful humor! Brilliant performances!!! What's not to like! I bought 6 of them to give to my children and a friend.<br /><br />PS: I rarely give a 5-star rating to a movie.
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|I cant even play it. It comes up as you don't own this app. I cant believe I spent my money on such a terrible thing. I want a refund.
3836538725|4.0|This borders on being a great book.  Most of Salgado's images, as usual, are fantastic, visceral, and informative.  Yet I fail to understand why so many publishers destroy otherwise beautiful photographs by doing a two-page spread that creates a divisive, distracting and annoying seam down the middle.  And why do significant photographers such as Salgado allow this to occur?  As attested to by many of the comments here, most viewers whom appreciate this sort of photography would rather view slightly smaller, yet undivided images.<br /><br />Otherwise, beautiful book.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|If you want to prevent dementia and other brain deteriation you need to read this surprisingly easy to understand and follow book.  It is not the latest fad diet.  It is about learning to feed your brain and your body not your emotions.  It is what not to eat and what to eat.  It is exciting and so imformitive..  LOVED IT!!

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|The Taliban should've contacted Barbara Streisand before they decided to \\"utterly fail\\" in their attempt to kill a young schoolgirl. In their hatred and bigoted world view, their tunnel vision resulted in drawing more attention to the battle cry of a truly brave young woman rather than her dying in ignominy. How does this relate to Barbara Streisand? Many years ago she sued several news and tabloid companies for displaying pictures of her home along the shores of California. Rather than giving her the privacy she wanted, it drew more and more attention to it as people scrambled to see what her fuss was about. So too did the Taliban when they failed in their mission to silence Malala that horrible day in the Swat Valley; rather than eliminate someone who they believed besmirched her family's honor, they turned her battle cry into the voices of millions who suddenly became aware of what was happening in their little valley.<br /><br />Malala may have been struck down, but she arose stronger than before. In a perverse way you could almost say that the Taliban, through their ignorant hatred, empowered Malala more than ever. Her book, \\"I Am Malala\\", is indicative of their \\"success\\". Now living in Birmingham, England, Malala has recovered from her horrible wound and is now nominated for a Nobel Prize. She is attending school and has traveled the world, most recently giving a speech at Harvard University, spreading her message of the importance of educating girls and women, regardless of their faith. Her strength is clear in not only her actions, but in the words she uses to tell her story.<br /><br />Her Journey<br /><br />\\"I Am Malala\\" begins with Malala reminiscing about her homeland, Pakistan, and her love of her country. As the pictures show in the description of the book's content, the Swat Valley is a beautiful place, as she describes it, with \\"high snow-topped mountains, green waving fields and fresh blue rivers\\". Soon, however, the pastoral beauty of her home is replaced by the horror of what happened to her on October 9, 2012. A year ago yesterday, a shot heard around the world was fired at Malala from point-blank range at her head. The Taliban, in their belief that women should not be educated, sought to silence Malala for her unforgivable crime of speaking out against that belief.<br /><br />Malala Yousafzai knew the risks, and yet she persevered and stood her ground. Her father opened the school where she studied and raised her to revere knowledge. Her pride in the school, her family, and her education lead to her suffering from near-fatal wounds, and in a completely unforeseen manner Malala was given the ability to bring attention to not only her plight, but to draw the world's attention to the Taliban's repulsive \\"rule\\" in her homeland.<br /><br />Malala's writing is punctuated with beautiful descriptions of her homeland, her amazement at the modern conveniences of England, and her heartbreak at knowing that she cannot sit next to her friend, Moniba, and joke in class as she had before the Taliban's gunman changed her life forever. From the moment that I picked up \\"I Am Malala\\", I was hooked; the narrative is written so eloquently that you will find yourself eagerly devouring each page to learn about how she was able to endure her injuries, to her first impressions of Birmingham, how she feels about her new school in England, and finally how international fame has helped her to work toward her ultimate goal: eliminating the fear that girls in the Swat Valley have when they travel to and from school. Never at any point did I lose interest in her words. It is my belief that anyone who picks up this book will feel the same way.<br /><br />Final Say<br /><br />\\"I Am Malala\\", quite simply, should be required reading for every high school student in the world. Too often do we who were blessed to grow up in a country with guaranteed educations for all children, regardless of gender or race or even religious beliefs, fail to realize just how much of a privilege that right truly is. This book helped to humble me quite substantially; I realize that I did take for granted my right to an education, and I never really saw that graduating from high school and the chance to go to college is much more special than most realize. Prior to the horrible injury that was inflicted upon her, Malala was speaking out to educate the girls of Pakistan and the world, knowing that she was in danger the whole time. Her chances of going to college may have been diminished because of her place of birth, but she was determined to learn as much as she could. Now that she is in a free country she is able to anticipate not just a primary education, but the dream of attending college and obtaining a degree.<br /><br />Succinctly put: buy this book. It will be a humbling, yet inspirational title for your collection, one that you can proudly display on your shelf. I guarantee that you will be drawn in, and maybe learn something to boot!ealize just how much of a privilege that right truly is.

B000B589JI|5.0|Zippo fuel is naptha, which has a high evaporation rate.  If you carry a Zippo in the field, you must have run out of lighter fluid when no refill is available.  With this fuel canister you can carry your refill on a keychain.  It refills from your larger can of lighter fluid.  It has proper rubbery washers protecting it against leakage, so you can depend on it.  Rubbing sticks together to build a fire is a useful skill, which should be practiced by the outdoorsman, but carrying the easy means to build a fire is a no brainer.  This item helps do it with some backup

B00CW665VI|4.0|Great to see a book entirely written from the male POV. And what a funny POV it was! Really original way of telling the story. In all honesty the plot was a little lacking IMO but the way the author told the story, and Drew's internal dialogue more than made up for it!

0062238868|5.0|Met Chief Kyle in transit to Iraq, good guy, good operator and a great book.  It was required reading for my wife and I recommend it to the wives of all operators in the field.  Mrs. Kyle puts it into a perspective that I had not heard before and my ex-wife was not able to articulate.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|Does not come close to reaching the creativity of classic fantasy literature. It's a hyped up medieval story on steroids- I couldn't care less about the characters, hence the bad review.
B003ES61EE|4.0|The pad on these are not as large as ones I have gotten in the past.  There doesn't seem to be any charcoal substance on the pad like I have used in the past that takes off the oil on a lense either.  It works okay but I'll order the others from now on for size/speed of the pad and the charcoal removal of oil.
B000002GVO|5.0|the price is right. you can't go wrong with the eagles.  really pleased it got to my doorstep as quick as it did. no complaints
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Don't waste your time!  It is more like a Disney production.  Very predictable film - a huge disappointment for Will Smith.  Watch the trailer a few times and get the idea of it.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|This book fully deserved its International Dagger Award.<br /><br />With so many new and excellent authors competing for readers, particularly in the mystery and thriller area, this book adds a new twist to the genre. You read about books giving you many twists and turns but here, you get the real thing. I cannot think of a fictional character who is more intriguing, resourceful and complex, as her story unfolds in this masterful book, then Alex. She truly is one of the great characters of literature, let alone mysteries. The rest of this trilogy will find this first volume to be a very hard act to follow.

B00C6F624K|5.0|OK maybe not the greatest film of all time, but so sweet and utterly believable even when it suspends belief... I think becausee we all want to do the &#34;go back in time&#34;  and have the do-over.  But I never get tired of watching it! If you were in high school in the 50's or the 60's, it should be on your &#34;best&#34; list.

B00DYEBM3I|4.0|Hope Sandoval's narcoleptic air, her drowsy voice and waifish demeanor, infused three albums by this loose lineup, under the direction of guitarist David Roback, from 1990 to 1996. Roback's previous band, Rain Parade, inspired many in the Los Angeles area with their own subdued, yet insistent, update on psychedelic textures as part of the Paisley Underground movement. Sandoval, then a teenager and a fan of the band, joined the successor to Rain Parade, Opal. They morphed into the enigmatically named Mazzy Star. Roback and Sandoval formed a romantic and musical partnership, that lasted until (it gets hazy) the connections faded and the formula of sticking to alt-rock successes such as their hit &#34;Fade Into You&#34; wearied the duo.<br /><br />This back history of Sandoval, Roback, and the other members (who often are shadowed and less credited unless one does some searching) must preface this return, seventeen years later, to form. Recorded since at least the mid-1990s in London, California, and Norway, these ten tracks at fifty minutes show a perfectly timed and thoughtfully chosen sequence of simple songs, played sparely. Seasons of Your Day grows on you and demands repeated listenings. At first, as with Rain Parade and Opal and the band's previous recordings, the songs may feel too airy, too evanescent.<br /><br />With exposure and scrutiny, the atmosphere around Sandoval's voice emerges. Co-producer Roback's finicky style, one senses, accounts for the long years of assembling this album. He echoes classic AOR rock. I hear far less the psychedelic swirl of his 1980s phase and much more the acoustic styles of &#34;Wild Horses&#34;, &#34;Going to California&#34;, and &#34;Wish You Were Here&#34;, which would have featured, I suppose, among his LPs as he grew up in balmy Pacific Palisades in the early 1970's.<br /><br />During that time, any coastal Californian teen could not escape The Beach Boys as the endless summer soundtrack. &#34;In the Kingdom&#34; immediately evokes this ambiance with its organ introduction, and Roback's bluesy guitar drops in to carry this into Sandoval's slow-burn mood, enhanced by soft wave-like splashes of brushed drums, slightly jazzy percussion, and noodling, then sharper, guitar progressions. This structure demonstrates Mazzy Star's gentle control of their direction, and it's a promising indication of the craft underlying and unifying this album.<br /><br />&#34;California&#34; conjures up Led Zeppelin's early-1970s strummed guitar. Roback creates tension in the upward riff, and Sandoval's steady delivery, as she sings about the ocean's call to draw her in, works well to balance the pull of the slightly edgy music, as it overlays her dreamy spell. As if a lost song off of the Rolling Stones in this same time, in their country-shaded period, &#34;I've Gotta Stop&#34; shuffles along into dust. Weariness lyrically and musically pervades this, and the middle of the album hushes.<br /><br />The acoustic, folksy &#34;Does Someone Have Your Baby Now&#34; brings back Roback's overlooked band between Rain Parade and Mazzy Star, Opal. That ensemble tended towards a darker, more spooky side, under singer Kendra Smith (ex-Dream Syndicate); it's great to hear the band enter this slyly haunted, ominous space, graced by Roback's slide guitar.<br /><br />&#34;Common Burn&#34; returns to a harmonica and guitar, twilit scenario. It's not a weak song, but it feels straightforward and does not veer much from its initial start. The title track, halfway in, lifts up by violin into a richer, poignant song so Sandoval can moan and long for love in a convincing fashion. The interplay of strings and percussion returns at the end to cap an affecting song with conviction.<br /><br />The Western amble of &#34;Flying Low&#34; enriches the progression of the album, which leans much more in a country-rock style than Mazzy Star's earlier work, until it rises slowly into a muted chorus over slide guitar.

B008K8VDPU|3.0|I tried the Pianist HD after trying the Perfect Piano to see if one had better sound than the other.  Both have the same problem so it may be with my HD Kendle's sound and not the App.  It is worth downloading if you enjoy playing music and you don't mind querckie sound.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful writing, interesting characters, I'm going to read it again. Even Better than kite runner. Our book club loves it.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|it wasnt horrible but i got it for my 5 yr old and she couln't read it so she constantly needed help
B003G4W49C|4.0|I couldn't put this book down even though it was depressing to see him manipulated and acting violently for self preservation.  Why do we as humans seem to need to conquer or defeat!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Danny Torrence from The Shining, escaping the horrors of the Overlook Hotel and his father's wrath. If you've seen the Kubrick film, you have an indelible image of a little boy riding around and around the foreboding hallways of the hotel on a plastic Big Wheel.  What happens to a kid who's been through something so terrifying?<br /><br />He grows up and copes with it, that's what happens.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Danny, he copes with his demons the same way his father did. With alcohol and lots of it. Dr. Sleep opens with Dan reaching rock bottom. But when he stumbles into Frazier NH, he manages turn his life around. He sobers up and takes a job as an orderly at the local hospice where, with his special abilities, he helps the patients die.<br /><br />His tranquility is shattered when Abra appears, a girl whose power to shine is off the charts. Her powers have attracted the attention of an evil group of immortal nomads called the True Knot, who travel the country in Winnebagos, appearing to all the world as harmless middle aged retirees. The only threat they pose is slowing you down on the freeway and talking your ear off at the grocery checkout line. A great cover for child killers.<br /><br />It was so much fun to read this novel. I love the feeling of blowing off the morning chores because I have to find out how everything turns out. Also, King makes the point that the alcoholism can be just as horrifying as any supernatural monster and Danny's triumph over both is satisfying.<br /><br />A truly great read.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Nowadays it's hard to NOT see or read Zombie themed movies, tv, or books that have a different slant --This movie DOES. It's really frightening if you really let it sink in that a REAL Pandemic could occur and what would you do if it really did happen? This movie is so creepy not because of blood and gore- but because it possible with all the superbugs evolving in our world. Don't think too hard on this or you'll be digging bomb shelters and loading up on rations along with trying to remember all those prayers you haven't said in years!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|The story concept was interesting and the writing made for a quick read. While compared to the Hunger Games in which a primary concept was kids killing kids for the entertainment of the Capital, the Maze Runner saw the kids being killed by 'Creator' variables rather than each other. The few instances of violence between the kids could have been left out without significant impact to the story line.

B005XLN97M|5.0|Got this for my daughter last Christmas. She loves it! Took quite a bit to put it together, but once it was she played for hours. We've had it for almost a year and it's still in one piece! It does come apart easily if you pick it up by the roof, but not a big deal!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Outin is the sequel to Outview and is the second in Legg's trilogy.  This spiritual/sci-fi/fantasy novel continues on where Outview left off.  We follow Nate and his brother as they are on the run while trying to prevent a disaster of epic proportions all while trying to save those closest to them.  Legg's maturity as an author is evident in Outin as the sequel flows even better than the first.  Legg will continue to draw you into his world of new age/spiritual concepts.  I look forward to reading, what I fear will be, the final installment in this series.  I am intrigued to find out what Legg has planned for his next project.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I was hooked from wo to go!  How do they dream up plots that are so exciting and different in each episode?  I can't wait for season 3!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was a quick, fun story about redemption and paying for one's sins.  The end twist was so well done, that even my husband, who prides himself on seeing through the story and figuring out what is coming, did not see it.  No great acting, the plot was a little out there as far as believability, but you usually don't go to the movies for reality.  I'd recommend this to someone who just wants a break.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like this game. It is slow to start but picks up after awhile. Plays like Mystery Manor...energy recharges and you earn crystals everytime you level up.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great to watch the hi-def of bluray at home, I give the dvd to my kids and I get the digital copy for when I travel.  Very fast shipping.

B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I was sorry to see the story end.  There were so many ways to have continued.  I hope to see the characters in some other book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|u need to update it to be able to have flint and steel and have Tnt able to blow up and be able to go to<br />the nether.
B0015F1VY8|3.0|I enjoyed this movie as an adult who likes drama in movies. I, however, am also a college student who watched the movie comparing it to the education I received on her life in my history class. This movie was not totally historically accurate, so if you are watching it to do better on a test, choose a different one. This one was full of drama and intrigue (yes, as her life was), well acted, well produced, as well as cinematically beautiful.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A bit predictable but enjoyable read. Going back in time to solve a problem is really Trek-like. Is that intentional?
B00571F26Y|5.0|Loved this informative read! It provides a great deal of insight into all the issues with the genetically created wheat found in EVERYTHING! Worth reading!
B008602KQI|3.0|The peak of this film is 67 minutes in, with CATNIP EVERGREEN thrust into the competition. Don't the leave the platform early... Alas, this is the height of the entire tension of the film, and it comes far too soon. The third act fell short in terms of dramatic tension. Too bad the producers concentrated on creating a PG-13 product for their core demographic rather than an actual work of art which was worth watching.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|this is my favoriate book of all times..  I just wishthe author had more books to read!  Hurry up Patrick!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Excellent customer service and awesome product! Thank you~
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I really enjoyed the subtle yet continual development of the characters in this masterpiece. I can hardly wait for the next book to come out.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Easy to read touching story. Of interest to those working with children in foster care in particular. It's also a creative tale involving flowers.
B002ZG980U|5.0|we loved the movie and wanted it for our personal library -<br />this is a great price and great quality - absolutely a good investment!
B00ET7EON4|5.0|You pick this album up in an ambulance, because these beats are sick.  Well put together music with inspiration from many sources.  Enjoyable to listen to a loud volumes.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|we loved the movie and wanted to have a copy of our own -<br />the extended cut is a bonus and for the amazon price - a very worth while investment!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|NEED MORE COMPATIBLE APPS!! Works wonderfully with Netflix, though I don't have Hulu plus, but with your Chrome browser it can stream anything from your laptop screen, however you will sacrifice resolution and may experience signal lag. If you are into Netflix, it works great with my iPad, iphone & Macbook Pro. Would like it to work with HBO GO & Comcast & Time Warner on demand apps. Can't beat the price though.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This is probably my favorite of the Star Trek TV series. The way the characters compliment each other, and the &#34;newness&#34; of being in space adds to the show.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|Ordered this for my husband, He started watching it immediately, but there are a lot of discs to go through so by time hit season 6 and found bad discs was past return date. Had read reviews about bad discs but thought bought from outside supplier - THIS WAS SOLD BY AMAZON AND HAD BAD DISCS- buyer be aware.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I am very busy, so this is the perfect way to watch an entire season in a few days. Awesome!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Lots of great areas that challenge you and make you think about how to clear the different levels. Lots of challenges with-in challenges. I think you should add points or fuel that could be picked up during air-time. Might make you jump more and of coarse add the challenge of not flipping over. Lots of fun.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|program is small and was easy to use. cleared a lot of space on my kindle. when programs run they create junk files that take up space this program helps clean them up.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Mr Card  grabs you  from the first page and keeps you wanting more till the very<br />end. One of my favorite books of all time.
B00138KKP8|5.0|I bought the entire album because I liked the song, &#34;Jolene&#34;, and I was not disappointed. It has quickly become a favorite.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|I enjoy NIN, more than enjoy they/he helped shape what I listened to for 10 years, from Pretty Hate Machine through The Fragile, and in between the greatest EP I have ever purchased in Broken.  Then radio silence for year before With Teeth and Year Zero, I was disheartened when I read Trent was cashing in his chips and ending NIN for other projects but then I head he had changed his mind and was prepping this album and I was excited.  I thought Year Zero was very underrated much like The Fragile was overrated and figured maybe he was going to continue to explore the themes from Year Zero, I had read at one point his plan was a series of albums with the same theme running through.  I anxiously awaited the release.<br /><br />I guess I have my own Hesitation Marks because I spent a full paragraph talking about anything but the new album, I guess in todays world it is digital download.  I want to like it more, the beats, blurbs and whistles still merge together for form a coherent aural experience but the music seems repetitive and the lyrics pale in comparison.  Maybe they should he has changed in 20 plus years, he might still be tortured but not like in 1989, but then again are any of us?  I am not giving up on it as I think maybe a good listen on a good stereo will serve me significantly better than cheap PC speakers and a digital reproduction but so far it is fine, even good.... great if held up against today's music but when held up against is own work I think he hesitated too much.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|So excited !!! Pre ordering as soon as I have some $$$$ ! I already have the movies but I need this boxset. SO MANY SPECIAL FEATURES!!!! Need need need
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Amazing read! A little difficult to get into at first for me but great new characters! I highly reccommend it

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is cheap. This is beautifully done.<br /><br />Next steps for Google:<br /><br />-- Allow 3rd party apps to cast content<br />-- Allow users to select video resolution from YouTube iOS app
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have enjoyed the Crossfire novels immensely. Can't wait for the next one. Each book kept me wanting more. Great read.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is by far the cutest, most fun game I've played in a long time! I loved the Dumb Ways To Die video, so I also love this game! Its hard to figure out, but sooo fun to play!
1401310672|5.0|Very hilarious, easy to read as there's only one-two texts per page, with seven distinct categories for your amusement. Serves as a great source of entertainment at parties, or when you're just in need of a laugh.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Let's keep this review short and sweet...and hopefully helpful. To start, the story is nothing new (seen Top Gun anyone), the acting is mediocre at best, the \\"plucky female\\" introduced at 23mins is stale, and the movie flat out drags at some points.  That being said, stick with it! The action scenes of robots vs monsters are well worth putting up with the movie's flaws.  If that other giant robot movie franchise had been 1/10th this good (or had such CLEAR and VIEWABLE effects) maybe people wouldn't hate those films so much.  On that note, it is worth mentioning that you can actually follow the action when the fight scenes take place.  They are clear and you can always tell what is going on. There is not a single \\"overly dark\\" scene hiding the effects.  With that, the effects are not \\"over-done\\" or lame.  They are all completely believable within the context of the film.  You WILL believe what you are seeing.<br /><br />To Repeat, the story is nothing new, but the fight scenes (you know, what you are actually watching this type of movie for) are spectacular!
B00BT70IWS|5.0|Well, here's  a voice, and while I agree with Ralph Moore that it perhaps isn't ideal for some of the music here, the quality of the voice itself, as well as Kaufmann's singing, musicianship, and dramatic instincts make this something to hear.  I hope someone records him soon in \\"Otello,\\" \\"Norma\\" and \\"Turandot\\" -- in between his Wagner engagements, that is.  The middle and lower voice have a very special richness and beauty, and the top is totally secure, even if not quite Italianate in its vowel quality.  The breath control and dynamic control are astonishing (the latter sometimes overdone), and the words are savored, even if the phrasing sometimes lacks an ideal flow.  Nothing here is careless -- everything is thought out and, on the whole well-executed.  Weak points for me are the \\"Boccanegra\\" scene (well sung, but doesn't \\"build\\") and the \\"Masnadieri\\" scene (not very interesting, with Chorus too far back).  Very fine are the \\"Celeste Aida\\" and the \\"Otello\\" items, and absolutely outstanding is the \\"Trovatore\\" scene -- a slow but beautifully-phrased \\"Ah si, ben mio\\" and a thrilling \\"Di quella pira.\\"  The orchestral support is efficient -- not nearly in the Abbado class, as on Kaufmann's German recital -- and the voice is forwardly placed but not too much so.  Make no mistake, though -- this is voice to savor.

B001EBWIPE|5.0|Hey, this movie has everyone in it.  For the time, it was a riot.  You can never go wrong with Cary Grant.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love it so far, and got it when it was the free app of the day.  I enjoy deducing which square are/could be which color, eventually building more & more information to deduce more square colors, etc.  Kind of like Mine Sweeper but much better (and I'm not worried about speed, just enjoying it).
B00957T6X6|5.0|So so very good. I can't wait for the next one to be ready. The show is fantastic, but the books bring such life to this world. I feel bereft having to step away.
1569765677|5.0|I would recommend this book to anybody that enjoys a very good read. The movie really didn't do it justice.
B00008BRB5|5.0|I have wanted this album since it came out and I finally got around to it.  packaged with a great, fully populated set of MP3sis the bonus round
B00AGKH45I|5.0|Wife loved this as a gift. She is spinning wax and loves it. She is trying to re[prdice the old fashion record collection
0920668372|5.0|I remember reading this book when I was younger and thought, oh this is a nice story. When I was buying some books for my new baby girl I decided to buy this one. Well the first time I read it to my daughter, I could barely get through it because I was crying so much. This book really captures the love of a mother- which I didn't really understand until I had a baby of my own.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|Very good movie. A lot of action and good actors. Better than I expected.  I will watch it again in the near future.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|When The Phantom of the Opera became a movie with Gerard Butler, I remember thinking, I hope they do this one day with Les Miserables. I was so excited when I heard it was finally happening! Like, bought tickets for the day it opened excited. Like, counted down till I could see it excited. And it didn't disappoint. I love this movie. I thought everyone did a great job singing and acting. I also understood more and picked up on parts of the story I never understood by the book or the stage musical.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book is a good story and well written. Many many many magical things happen--things that break become unbroken on a regular basis and people regularly disappear. Be prepared to suspend belief. It got so common that even in my real life while I was reading it, I couldn't find my comb one day and it felt logical that it had just disappeared.
0399226907|5.0|I loved this book as a kid! I'm so glad I can now share it with my daughter. I like the fact that it's a board book so it's easy for my baby to handle. The smaller size is good to because we can take it places and it won't take a ton of room in the diaper bag.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|My 9 month old sleeps with one Wubbanub in her mouth, and one in each hand. I keep a stash of them in my car so I can easily pop a new one back over to her when she chucks it out of her carseat. The monkey is my favorite because it's dark colored - makes it easy for her to see it on her white bed sheet in the middle of the night so she can pop it back in.
0345803485|3.0|I bought this book because of the hype. I'd heard it described as 'mommy porn' and was curious.  I found the Ana character to be severely lacking in self respect and Christian is a controlling jerk. I wanted to smack them both. The sex scenes aren't overly explicit, which is nice, because there are a lot of them and they become tedious. The kinky sex isn't over the top, except for Christian's insistance on the 'submissive' and punishment aspects. He is one sick, twisted control freak.  I stopped reading this book several times, but found myself picking it up again a day or two later. The urge to see what psycho quirk Christian would show and whether Ana would finally say 'stop this b.s.' was strong. So, I finished the book finally and I'm glad to set it aside. I have no desire to read the remaining 2 volumes.<br /><br />I have to admit that the book annoyed me enough that I was driven to discuss it with friends, which is why I gave 3 stars.
0345803485|3.0|The lead character has become a wimp to his feelings.. letting go of his confidence.  The story line was good at the start... but deteriorated.

B005OYKI1I|4.0|And here I was thinking that a movie couldn't be more silly and unbelievable than Fast 6. I was wrong. That movie is Fast 5, and it embraces it's stupidity and turns it into a highly entertaining and explosive action picture.<br /><br />How did director James Lin do it? He did away with the street-racing angle, played up the chemistry between the impressively buff and gruff Vin Diesel and his crew, and added more bikinis, six-packs, and shiny sports cars. Oh, and [[ASIN:B0088WJV4I Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson]], who is like franchise viagra (No really: Journey, GI Joe, Fast and Furious, Brett Ratner's career), and looking here like he is made out of actual, chocolate-coloured, extremely charismatic rock.<br /><br />Lin took the franchise away from the US, and set it in the colorful land of \\"BrraZEEL!\\", here represented as a party-filled, gangster-ruled, corrupt, street-racing, hot girl-populated tropical paradise. He made the action scenes unbelievably fast (and furious) and silly, the villains deliciously evil, the Rock so incredibly testosterone-oozing, and kept the plot sweet and simple.<br /><br />This is an action movie running on the simplest, cleanest action movie bones. This is formula to the max - workable, reliable formula. This is a man's movie to the max: fast cars, fast women, fast guns, explosions, biceps, bullets. And the Rock.<br /><br />If you are looking for a smart, brilliantly acted, unforgettable action movie, seek out Heat or Hard Boiled. Avoid this if you are A. looking for a smart thriller. B. Have sensitive eardrums. C. Want to watch something stimulating.<br /><br /> Much like the shiny cars it often treats like battering rams, Fast 5 is loud, fast, occasionally clunky, shiny on the outside, extremely workable on the inside, and a great ride. And that's high praise for an action movie.<br />This is the best of the Fast and Furious franchise; a worthy showcase of the charisma and bear-growling of its star, [[ASIN:B00A2H9OZS Vin Diesel]], fine cinematography, explosive action, cool one-liners, and some excellent car racing/chasing scenes. Oh, and Gal Gadot is *stunning*. Yeah, you know the scene.<br /><br />My rating? Fast Four stars! (get it? See what I did there?)inematography, explosive action, cool one-liners, and some excellent car racing/chasing scenes. Oh, and Gal Gadot is *stunning*. Yeah, you know the scene.<br /><br />My rating?

B00F35BV64|3.0|Too bad this latest Star Trek was just another showcase of an alternate universe.  I'm sure its a nice twist for the die-hard ST fans, but it didn't have much of a story line and the great sound track was a repeat from the first JJ Abrahms ST Movie.  Let's move out into SPACE next time, if there is a next time.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|Being a fan of Eltons music for some time now he has drifted back to classic old style. Richly produced by T Bone Burnette and colabroating with Bernie this is a winner. Each song is genuine and not fluffy holyweirdish, Its more Daniel style with catchy hooks that will pull you along. Great from the opening tune to the last....welcome back!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book is better than book 3 I loved the 1st, 2nd and 3rd books in the series now on book 4
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Great insight into the mind of an inspired writer.  Anyone can find buried treasure in this book...or at least a few fossils.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I think it's an ok game.<br />It has no limit to your imagination. You can build it all if you have that kind of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's great . It's fun it just takes a little while to load but other than that it's better than temple run
159463176X|5.0|This covers a wider range of time and place of the Afghan experience, including some of Afghan-Americans. Less traumatic that Kite Runner, but still filled with the sadness of that nation's history.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I like this novel very much, so far....<br />I LOVE the fact that Reacher keeps asking everyone if they have seen Yoko...that cracks me up.  Even tough guy Reacher can be impressed by some things. (Lennon's widow)<br /><br />\\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" was my first Reacher experience - and I LOVED it.  It was fast paced and flawless.<br />\\"Gone Tomorrow\\" was my second Reacher - it was very good...and was very satisfying.<br />I guess that is Lee Child's mission, to make Reacher series satisfying for the reader.<br /><br />This third - The Hard Way, is my least favorite of the three, but still an interesting novel.  And as I have already admitted I have not finished it, though we all know it will end well for Reacher.<br /><br />BTW - Tom Cruise made a great Reacher....I don't understand why that film was not a huge box office hit.  It was better than 95% of the rubbish that rakes in too much dough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Needs more levels. Plowed through the first ten levels in just a couple of hours of game play.  Now waiting patiently for the updates.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I love changing up my home screen with their widgets and expressing my style with their awesome wide range of settings!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Kids like the energy, music and dancing. The story really has some flaws with the plot, but does it really matter? It's a fun, light-hearted film that can be watched over and over again.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I was excited about Orange Is the New Black because of the hype of the television series, of which I have yet to see. The first half of the book was intriguing and had be getting through it quickly. However, after some point, the book became very repetitive. All the thoughts and discussion of the second half had already been established and thought out. I understand it's a true story, and I can't comprehend going through such an event, but I was surprised by the ending, and am anxious to find what makes the TV series so intense.
B00CX7OW1G|1.0|one of the most boring films i have ever seen in my entire life and I've seen at least 10.,000 movies.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Hands down, Star Trek was a good movie. But Star Trek Into Darkness? It is a GREAT movie!<br />*KHAAAANNNN!* ;D

B000077VR3|5.0|My daughters and I love Moulin Rouge.  We can watch this movie over and over for the bright vibrant fun, the colors, the costumes and the tragic love story.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|What constitutes love?  What constitutes betrayal?  What constitutes life?  All these issues and more are explored in the film &#34;The Descendants.&#34;  George Clooney's acting is at its best when it appears that he is not acting at all.  He is believable as a single parent, confronted with recalcitrant children, recalcitrant family, and an unfaithful spouse, all played out against a lush Hawaiian backdrop. The role earned Clooney a well-deserved Best Actor nomination.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Works perfectly on the Kindle Fire.  Have not had any issues.  Would recommend.  Not sure how this would work ona  phone or ipad.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new version is horrible. It will not load half the time. Is not user friendly. Do not waste your time with this app.
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|\\"Royals\\" is an astonishing pop masterpiece; one of the best singles I've heard in the past decade.  \\"Tennis Court\\" is also very good.  The rest of the album is competently sung, written, produced, and played, but borders on simply listenable filler.  Overall, Lorde is an intriguing bridge between several current musical spheres: mainstream Top 40 pop, indie electronic, and brooding singer-songwriter.<br /><br />(The more music geeky, name-droppy description of Lorde's sound might go something like this: Current disposable Top 40 pop of the Miley Cyrus/Katy Perry mold is cross-fertilized with the more challenging/avante garde aspects of current female-fronted indie electronic acts such as The Knife/Fever Ray, Grimes, or even veterans such as Goldfrapp or Ladytron.  The spare, booming beats--which really trace their DNA back to Billy Squier's ubiquitously sampled \\"Big Beat\\"--would not be out of place on the Southern hip-hop meets goth influenced \\"witch house\\" follow-up to Salem's \\"King Night\\".  The lyrics/vocals, meanwhile are more firmly in the singer-songwriter tradition of a Fiona Apple or Tori Amos.  Really an interesting mix of styles/influences.)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was better then I thought, keeps you wanting to read more and more, very sexy and steamy. Read it!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series has it all with way more class! This family manages to remain human despite how untouchable their title and money makes them seem.
B00CLNVOL8|1.0|In fairness, the movie was good, but the video stream kept stopping and had to be restarted throughout the entire movie! Extremely annoying. We checked Netflix and Comcast to make sure it wasn't our internet service and it was not. This is not the first time this has happened with movies we've downloaded from Amazon.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|loved them and I would recommend them to most everyone who isn't a chicken. I will be buying the rest of the series too!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beautiful fun absorbing.  That last one I have to. Watch .<br />Meetbthe challenges,  save your points for the big purchases,  have fun.  Can notvwait to get back to it . . Gotta go
B002HWRYJE|5.0|great movie I really liked it, fun for the whole family to watch. loved how they put some comedy in it.
B000EXZI1O|5.0|This cd has one great song after another.  To any Bee Gees fan.  I would highly recommend this cd.  Brings back a lot of good memories.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I read this book as a Catholic and as a physician.  For many of the faithful, our faith does not require proof in the scientific sense.  But as a physician, I am interested in how others approach faith.<br /><br />I'm afraid I find Dr. Alexander's book disappointing.  I would expect a neurosurgeon to write more knowledgeably about his own condition, and it makes me suspicious that he either is not very knowledgeable or he sustained a cognitive deficit from this infection from which he has not recovered.<br /><br />For instance, when he writes of his initial presentation, he states he was in \\"status epilepticus.\\"  From his report of what other physicians said about his behavior, however, he was clearly delirious and not in status epilepticus.  These are two totally different medical conditions.  And he describes his brain as being destroyed based on a head CT showing what sounds like meningitis.  Well, a head CT is not a very good study for diagnosing meningitis and it is not very good at showing irreversible brain injury.  You need a brain MRI for that.  It is really a stretch to think a physician would make far-reaching predictions about a patient's outcome based on a head CT.  And it makes me wonder.  A competent neurosurgeon would know these things.  Was he just counting on readers taking him on faith and not checking that he really knows what he is talking about?  In my case, I can't help it, but I recognized that he did not report his true medical condition accurately in the book.  I lost faith in Dr. Alexander at that point and then did not finish the book.<br /><br />But I'm glad he recovered.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Love this movie, better then the first two, I would pay to see this again. Love the actors in it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is soooo cool I have a great time surfing everyone in the world should have subway suffers soo cool
B00F35BV64|3.0|If you are as old as I am and have seen the TV show and the original ST movies, this one comes across as a remake.  Changing a few names, situations and locations doesn't make a new plot
0374533555|5.0|I'm a quarter through this book and it is amazing. It's really helped me understand what, why, how, i think. You can't correct faulty thinking until you understand why/how you think, and why it's faulty.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I purchased this DBTech slide/negative converter for my husband for his birthday, and he reports that it is a pretty nifty little tool to have. He has been able to convert a number of negatives without any problems, which has allowed him to view pictures he had never seen before or hadn't seen in quite a number of years. Very pleased with the purchase.
0061438294|5.0|This book is well written and informational. I have friends in law enforcement who were amazed I had this knowledge. It will help you in every day life.
