1565847032|5.0|While much of this book is fairly prosaic by Chomsky's standards (i.e. indictments against US terrorism, corporate avarice, etc.), in my opinion these polemics actually belie the most provocative aspect this particular book has to offer on Chomsky's philosophy. In his ideas on anarchist theory, his tips for activists, his prognosis for our society's future - here we see an unexpected side of the most visible contemporary American radical: Chomsky the pragmatist, the moderate, the rationalist (in the vein of Voltaire and Russell)...he even delivers a pretty severe critique of the North American and European Marxist intelligentsia. <BR>A trenchant and wide-ranging exploration of a leading intellectual's thoughts on issues as diverse as sports, abortion and the internet.

(which is to leave the her elegant vocals skill firmly imprinted in the listeners consciousness), and therefore becomes one of those rare albums to is frequently revisited, when music of a real substance is required.

Also he is betrayed by a \\"Judas\\" in the first movie.  When you watch the Matrix I, II and III you ask yourelf questions.  What is the Matrix?  Will Nemo fail?  Who is the Malrovingian?  Can Nemo trust the Oracle?  Why was Nemo \\"created\\" by the MAtrix?  Overall it is a very good movie cerial.  I hope this review has helped people understand and get into the world of the Matrix!

B000084T18|4.0|Undoubtedly one of the most talked about rappers & debuts in the last 10 years. (although it's worth noting that although this is considered his `Debut', there is an album that is a compilation all of his previously unreleased work, for another record label, that hit just before the release of this album....look for \\"Guess Who's Back?\\"). Although it would be nigh on impossible to match what has centred around a media frenzy of Biblical proportions....50 Cent manages to rise above such trite wrangling's and deliver a album, that is almost equal to the hype surrounding it......Graphically dramatic, verbally Pro-drugs, & its appears that our Mr Cent, has something of a Gun fetish. Unsurprisingly the album covers all bases, wherein by you have the Dancefloor fillers \\"In Da Club\\"......introspective melancholy \\"Gotta Make It to Heaven\\"......& Pro-drug manifesto \\"High All The Time\\". But as any Hip-Hop listener will tell ya....a rappers only as good as his lyrical ability / Content, and 50 cent is no exception.....He raps in a slightly stoner / Laid back drawl, which is unusual considering most lyricists are more concerned with rapid scattershot rhymes. But 50 cent's lazy rapping style is best exemplified, in floorfiller / Radio friendly \\"In Da Club\\", that sees 50 Cent is a playful knockabout style, that immediately starts `a head bopping (and with Eminem & Dr Dre producing, you'd expect no less).....50 Cent was always going to have a hard time, elevating himself (& his album), to the unprecedented heights that the hype surrounding it has created, Yet this is a clear shot to his competitors, that if they intend to hang with 50 Cent, they're going to have to reinvent themselves, but 50 Cent has firmly raised the bar.
078401213X|5.0|What should a movie be?  A (insert one) funny, dramatic, action packed, exotic, futuristic, fantastical slice of life, a recording of what everyone already knows?  Or should it be something that is totally beyond viewer expectation, literally and visually and sonicly?  I'll always vote for the latter.  In fact this film reminds me of the '50s New York improv school of film.  The Cassavetes, the Poitier, the b&amp;w, the hand held street shots, the minimalist lighting and sound.  A more arty film-noir.  <br />A perfect stage for the deep thinker looking to unhide a secret of the universe.  A math-computer wiz dealing with problems on both sides of reality.  In spite of the hokey math and computer stuff, I found the story and acting riveting and inspiring.
B00006BTCA|5.0|2001/2002 was certainly a good year or two in the U.K. for music....with many new Indie Bands, beginning to head up something of a minor resurgence within the genre, and mostly settling on urgent, energised rock, or accessible feel-good sounds, that captured the imagination of both the underground and mainstream markets.  The new movement was headed up by bands such as: The Vines, The Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs, The Strokes.  It was strange then that Interpol released an album around this largely exuberant sound in indie music.  \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" is a wondrous piece of work from the collective New York based group, whom have produced an album that stands perfectly on it's own merits.  Theirs was an introspective sound that instead capitalizing on being brash, swaggering and volatile....instead mined the more dark, introspective, melancholic, atmospheric and sometime Cathartic moods, of music that was distinctly, (for want of a better phrase) `on a downer'.  Firstly let it be known that what Interpol decided to do here went completely against the grain of what was mostly being released around that time.  And instead pushed forward by choosing to create an album, that had a marvelous way, of mixing building guitar melodies, with a super-thick rhythm section and stabs from a reverb-drenched guitar ... Interpol has an extraordinarily commanding presence for a band releasing its debut album. Its music is dark and tense with references both subtle and obvious,  and through their introspective moods and sound, it hard not to hear that there are nods and referecnces to the seminal group \\"Joy Division\\" & even \\"The Cure\\" (to a lesser degree) whom both seem to be have been an influence here.  And although there are references to Joy Division, their debut is not in debt to them, as they've transcend their influences and make an album that is uniquely theirs.  There is something of an anguished, sombre, disenchanted feeling of emotion throughout the album, (Not that the album focuses purely on melancholy.  Although the achingly downbeat sombre histrionics of \\"NYC\\" is as fine an encapsulation of the bands ability to shine light musically, from the most cathartic of song-writing). the tracks themselves are beautifully uplifting in a kind of insular and reflective way.  But there is a underlying spellbinding/hypnotic element to their music, that sucks you in, and holds your attention through to the very end. (best demonstrated tracks \\"Obstacle 1\\", \\"PDA\\" & \\"Obstacle 2\\", being two examples of tracks that highlight the different aspects of their music), \\"Untitled\\", for instance, uses a gorgeously swaying melody, with the mood taking something that invokes all the searching, and yet cautious and artificial instrumentation, mixed with minor-key melodies and sharp, edgy, nervous motion. Throughout the album the vocals has a slightly detached and weary register, with a somewhat cold baritone, yet this just adds to the overall mood of the album.  Tracks such as \\"Roland\\" and \\"Obstacle 2\\", and \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\", assert Interpol's mastery of not just the slower and more dramatic tracks.  But via these tracks show that the band is more than capable of shifting up a gear, and adds a little volatile tension to the proceedings.  It's usually the mark of a truly great album, when you first get into a band, through the publicity and hype that accompanies an album release....and yet, still find your able to go back several years later, and still thoroughly enjoy what intrigued you about the band in the first place.  Admittedly it's not the happiest of listening experiences, but then that never stopped `The Cure\\", so I'll say that `Turn on the bright lights' (for me), remains as completely absorbing and engaging as when I first picked this album up in 2002...and for that reason alone, I couldn't possibly give it a higher recommendation.

B000005IRG|5.0|Although part of the New York Punk Movement....this is not to be confused with `British Punk' music...which is a very different beast. The New York equivalent of Punk music, is places for more emphasis on Guitar lead music, with elements of Garage Rock, and less of the jumpy-shouty rhetoric of British bands such as the \\"Sex Pistols\\".....and there's no better example of the differences between U.S & British punk rock, than \\"Televisions\\" stunning (and highly influential) \\"Marquee Moon\\" debut. The Guitar play between the two guitars Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd, is akin to a Rapping Contest / Stand off....to see who can out perform each other....if proof of this was needed, check out title track \\"Marquee Moon!, for some of the most Hypnotic, Intense & down right complex guitar craftsmanship, this side of `Eric Clapton'....It truly is a masterpiece and deserves the price of buying the album alone (and at 10 minutes long for that track, it needs to be), backing up all of this is a fantastic set of songs, convey the contemporary urban feel of their time. (in a similar way to what \\"The Clash\\", so perfectly achieved), a trailblazing album, that helped shaped the burgeoning New York Punk scene.
B0000E1ALR|3.0|OK, after listening to this CD on my home stereo all the way through, I'm amending my original review from 4 stars to 3.    For a guy who often devotes excruciating attention to details, Bruce could have done much better than this.<br />The first two discs sound pretty good.  Not as big an improvement as some remastering jobs I've heard, but better than the original CD releases.  No major complaints there.  <br />Regarding the song selection- Bruce addresses that himself in the introduction, acknowledging that you'll never please everyone and that there are always valid arguments for what to leave in and what to leave out.  I think that he went overboard with 5 selections from the first two albums, and I think it was a mistake to leave off several well-known hits like \\"I'm On Fire\\", \\"Pink Cadillac\\" and \\"Secret Garden\\".  If you're going to appeal to newcomers and so-called \\"casual\\" fans, then you need to have as much accessible and recognizable material as possible.  For instance, \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" is an essential song, but in its studio version it's not quite as listenable as it is live or in the context of the original album.  \\"Prove It All Night\\" is a much more instantly accessible song and probably better known.  And the two live songs at the end- I would have either used shorter studio versions or left off one to make room for other stuff.  Both are again \\"essential\\", but not necessarily listenable on a collection of hits.  Maybe they wanted to avoid a predictable hits collection.  If so, I guess that's a good thing.  Overall, all of these songs are \\"essential\\", and they did as good a job as possible compiling a decent sampling of Springsteen's work from the early days to the present.  Unlike some Essential collections, at least they maximize the disc space to include as much music as possible.  <br />Now we come to the bonus disc- the incentive for all of the fans who have owned the rest of this material for years.  My initial complaint still stands- there's at least 30 minutes of unused space on this 3rd disc.  Springsteen has so much unreleased studio and live material that it's a huge waste to not ultilize this disc to the fullest.  Unless Bruce has another \\"Tracks\\" or \\"Live\\" collection coming out sometime soon, this would have been a great opportunity to make available some elusive unreleased cuts that his fans have long clamored for.  I'm not going to get into the issue of whether or not this was a rip-off aimed at exploiting the dedication of his \\"hardcore\\" fans (after all, their obsessiveness is THEIR problem, not Bruce's), but lots of people are going to be spending $15-$20 for basically this third disc that consists of barely 45 minutes of material.  <br />That was my complaint before even hearing the album.  After my first listen in my car, I didn't pay much attention to the sound quality.  At home on my stereo, though, it's evident that much of this material was either in poor shape or that little attention was paid to mastering it.  I've heard bootlegs that sound better than \\"Held Up Without A Gun\\" and \\"County Fair\\".  I realize that some of these are demos, but so was the Nebraska material, and it sounds much better.  That might explain the spareseness of the renditions, but it shouldn't account for the outright poor quality.  \\"County Fair\\" sounds like an old, slightly warped tape that's been sitting in your car for too long.  Maybe the sound quality was intentional (clearly the acoustic \\"Countin' on a Miracle\\" was meant to sound like an amateur recording, and in that case I think the effect works quite well), but I doubt it.  I think the spotty quality and brief running time of this third CD is pretty inexcusable, and not typical of the usual sonic quality of releases that expect from Bruce Springsteen over recent years.<br />The liner notes at least include the lyrics, but there are so many mistakes and omissions that anyone who knows or follows along can't help but notice them.  The listing ofmusicians is pretty confusing too, although overall I'll give this one credit for having better documentation than most Essential or greatest hits CDs.  <br />Overall, the music is great- the songs are indeed essential, and good introduction to Springsteen's music for the uninitiated or for those whose interest doesn't extend much beyond what you hear  on the radio.  It provides a look at all aspects of Springsteens- singer, songwriter, musician, storyteller, live performer, poet, hard rocker, etc.  I'm not going to look down my nose at people who want no more than this- after all, you can't own every album by every possible artist, even if it's Bruce Springsteen.  I own collections like this for plenty of artists, and if I like what I hear well enough, I'm usually motivated to look a little deeper.  If not, there's nothing wrong with enjoying a collection of a few hits and a few album tracks.  The third disc is OK- nice to have \\"Trapped\\" and \\"Missing\\" and \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" on CD- but overall a disappointment and arguably non-essential even for Bruce's biggest fans.  The remastering is a nice improvement, although I don't know that it would be enough of an incentive by itself for those of us who already own this material.  Bruce badly needs to remaster his entire catalog, and hopefully this is a project on the near horizon.  Let's just hope he does it with a bit more thoroughness and thought than seems to have gone into this project.  This clearly seems to have been a rushed project done in order to capitalize on the end of the recent tour and on the upcoming holiday season.  Nothing wrong with that if it's done well, but a lot of fans have come to expect more from Springsteen and this release doesn't quite deliver.
B000002LVB|5.0|Possibly irritated by the fact that although their previous albums had be lauded by the Critics & considered a highly influential set of albums (The Velvet Underground & Nico, White Light/White Heat, & The Velvet Underground albums), this was to be the album that although not entirely straying from their unorthodox approach to songwriting (tales of Whores & Drugs, and self loathing, from a band that were Widely know for their drug consumption)..this was going to be the album that broke them into the mainstream (even though each successive album was more successful than the last), and although their appears to be a softer edge to their music, (wholesale elements of Pop music, have seamlessly been worked into their Rock & Roll template, with less mentions of Sex & Drugs than previous albums), they still managed to produce songs that scream out & out timeless material.first track \\"Who Loves the Sun\\" with its beatles-esque summertime vibes sees The Velvets matching their Volatile & Confrontational songs Hits songs of before, with something capable of matching for more freewheeling & Cheerful..track number two \\"Sweet Jane\\" & \\"Rock & Roll\\", are The velvets lending their considerable skills to killer anthemic tracks, that are easily as well writing & memorable as anything they have ever recorded..Honestly, there isn't a single bad song (or indeed anything that could be considered Filler) on this album, which let me to question the album title \\"Loaded\\". One can only assume that they were referring to \\"Loaded\\" with hit songs??!!
B00005B58Y|5.0|This album according to me, is Miles best album. Yes, I even put it before &quot;Kind of blue&quot;.<BR>This album has speed and elegance is hardhitting and free.<BR>If you are coming from the rock music genre and are beginning to explore the jazzworld. This is the album.<br />Neither Bill nor Gil Evans is participating on this album and as great and fine musicians they were, I'm not quite sure that their influence on Miles musical production was entirely good.<br />There's a lot of John Coltrane on this album and I'm a big fan of him. The title tune, &quot;Milestones&quot; is the ultimate hard-bop jazz anthem.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|This soundtrack just blew me away when I saw the movie - so Tarantino, and simultaneously so specific to the movie.  The music of this movie really sets the tone of the whole thing, and for good reason - the music is almost invariably upbeat, and when it's not, it's often simply beautiful.  If you liked the movie, you'll definitely like the soundtrack, as it invokes a sense of the movie.  Even if you aren't one for blood and gore, this album has some great music, and I suggest you give it a listen.<br />&quot;Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;Green Hornet&quot; and &quot;The Flower of Carnage&quot; are my favorite tracks, though it's hard to choose.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I didn't have enough patience to wait until the morning to go to the store, so I bought all the songs from liquidaudio at midnight when it was released and jammed with it till 2 o clock in the morning.  I had heard the first piece a few days earlier, but I expected it to me more mainstream-like than the rest of the album, since it is a radio release.  My expectations were met, for the rest of the pieces are clear-cut progressive extravaganza (and I mean that in a good way) that should satisfy fans of prog metal all over the world.  This album differs from previous releases in some ways, just like any Dream Theater album differes from another (Pink Floyd employed a similar approach).  But that's what's great about DT - so far they haven't gotten old and managed to change aspects about their compositional style on just about every album.  There is a great slow, instrumental song on the cd, and my only complaint is that it should have been a bit longer.  Musical quotations, which Dream Theater incorporates very well into its pieces, are present here and there  - a technique that has been applied earlier in music by many 19th and 20th century composers.  Nevertheless, too much analysis would spoil the pleasant surprises of the album.  &quot;Train of Thought&quot; is definetly recommended by a Dream Theater fan for true Dream Theater and prog metal fans.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Given the very poor overall quality of sci-fi movies released every year, maybe I don't have the right to complain about Equilibrium. After all, it's a well-made, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi movie in the finest tradition of the `highest' prototype of the genre, with some great design ideas and highly impressive action scenes. And, to tell the truth. I quite enjoyed it. It sure was better than the Matrix Revolutions. It strikes me as peculiar, though, that with so many great sci-fi novels lying around just waiting to be adapted, this movie ever needed to be made. The plot of Equilibrium is so incredibly trite and predictable, I can practically spot which novel each aspect of it was taken from. Most of all it owes incredible amounts to 1984, while the fight scenes are inspired directly by The Matrix. The plot twists are predictable, and the ending immensely disappointing. There were more than a few 1984 rip-offs made before; check out Terry Gilliam's Brazil for one that managed to stay fresh and original. Equilibrium, on the other hand, makes no new statement and thus fails to justify its existence.<br />A few words of praise, though, should go to the lead actors. Christian Bale is great in the main part, but I was more impressed with supporting actors Emily Watson and Sean Bean - Sean delivered a short performance, but nevertheless it was the best part of the movie. It can be safely said the story becomes more boring and more predictable as the story goes on, the deterioration beginning with the death of Bean's character, and hitting rock bottom with that of Watson's. The ending in particular is rushed, unconvincing and unimpressive. Matthew Harbour as Bale's son is especially wasted, as are all the lead villain characters. The final showdown is far too short and the happy ending too strained; it almost seems as if the last twenty minutes were glued on, like the fabricated happy ending Brazil got in its US version. Still, good acting, good photography, good pace(for the first hour and a half) and terrific fighting choreography make Equilibrium a nice watch. If you're a fan of the genre it's worth renting, but don't expect too much of it.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|What a cd!! Godsmack displays the most hard rock stuff, they can clearly define the essence of hard rock. They changed quite a bit on this cd, their songs sound much more melodic and meaningful. One minor drawback is that all the songs sound similar to Awake, except for a few exceptions.<br />Starts off with the single &quot;Straight Out Of Line&quot;, it's a really hard and commanding song, then it follows up with the hard guitars of &quot;Faceless&quot;, which is one of the best on the album. &quot;Changes&quot; has a less heavy tune and more melodic verse and chorus. <br />One good example of melodic hard rock is &quot;Re-Align&quot;, the solo in this song is where Godsmack displays the essence of hard rock(download from kazaa and try). &quot;Releasing The Demons&quot; has a more unique tune towards the whole album, very good use of the wah pedal in the verses. A really mysterious melody in the verses and a really angry chorus. The song sounded more like a theme song for a scary movie. &quot;Serenity&quot;, the acoustic track at the end of the cd is very mellow, very good to chill to and sing to.<br />All in all, this album did not fail to impress me, for all you hard rock fans i recommend picking this up.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This album unlocks a whirlwind of emotions for me. I was listening to it, and I wrote some poetry while listening to it. The lush, gorgeous tracks are very inspiring and beautifully composed. I wasn't too sure I was going to like it, but when I listened to it I was totally blown away. Buy it. You won't regret entering the world of Secret Garden.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead does not disappoint but delivers 'Hail to the Thief'. The album at best could be described as a bland of 'The Bends' and 'Ok Computer'.

Not many bands today rise to the level in musical complexity to that of Radiohead.
B00005JMFI|5.0|Newhart, Caan and others...great movie. Ferrell is moving away from usual stuff we hope as my kids love him and this ain't like SNL, more family oriented but fun.I liked the storyline, the singing in shower, the troll! Do wish Ferrell was more animated, think the flat affect is copy of Newhart( i mean does he ever blink in any sketch?) but every place we ever see him-zero animation and it doesn't work for him like Newhart, i think. It looks natural for Newhart-not Ferrell. The music was great. Would go see it again and hope to buy DVD soon.Did i tell you i prefer kids watching things like this to MTV and other on TV, i can only hope he is sensing that teens idolize his comedy and make it good!
B00008PW2D|3.0|Ok...I've read the other reviews and I have to say...what is wrong with you all?? I started watching the series in season two and with one episode, I was hooked. I quickly snatched season one and two and lived for season 3 to start on HBO when I had it. The days of having HBO ended when I decided to go back to college and so, unfortuantely, did the day so catching 'Sex' on Sunday night. I now live for the sets to come out and there's no way I'm supressing myself of season 5 after intently watching season 4. $30 or not, I'll be paying HBO's price for the set because I'm a huge fan of the show and I've figured that for the price of dvd set, I'm saving money not having to subscribe to HBO. (I know what you're thinking...I get a lot more than just 'Sex and the City' but in my reality..I don't...by the time the movies hit HBO I've seen then via Blockbuster). There's no swaying this fan not to buy a dvd set of her beloved show.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Not that much that I can say about this album. I don't think I really have to. I obtained this album with little previous knowledge of what it was all about. My original opinion of it was formed by the first and second tracks, including the transition between the two. It started out with a reasonably captivating combination of quiet sound effects, and then the second track hit you in the face.. That was kinda intriguing. At this point I hadn't yet really payed any attention to the lyrics. I went to marsvolta.com and found out what De-Loused wasa actually written about at which point I decided to read along with the music. <br />The not so immediately apparent story is told very well through choice of lyrics and musical accompaniment, although Im not certain if I should be giving this album five stars considering that It is an original story, but not an original idea as many have said. The album as a story has been done by many before. This album however does tell a story in a beautiful and strangely enchanting way, if the unavoidable ending of death is something that enchants you... <br />All in all, I was very impressed. There wasn't anything I could think of that would have made the album any better, although It can not compare in musical achievement to some other groups out there. <br />I would recommend this to anyone that likes an album that could have been a visual success, but took the form of an auditory masterpiece.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I just recently bought this SACD and I must say it rocks.  I mainly bought it for \\"you can't always get what you want\\", however I forgot how good this album is.  I can listen to this album over and over. If you have never listened to a Stones album, this would be a good place to start.  Also, you will need to have a fairly new CD player, one that can read CDR/RW in order to hear this amazing album.  FYI it does not play on x-box either.
B0000CFW87|5.0|From the moment I hit \\"play\\" with this album in the stereo, I knew I'd never listen to music the same way.Every measure, every note, and every word brings us infinitely closer to musical perfection.Josh's melliflous voice transports you to a world of beauty and art; a comfort zone of incredible harmony and unbelievable range.<br />I was surprised that this album was even better than the first, yet upon more listening it seems natural.Josh has grown as an artist and songwriter,and his voice shows new dynamics on this sophmore effort.He seems to find that spot in the heart that causes your whole body to shiver; he crawls into your spirit and teaches you things about life and love.It's more than a cd; it is a soul-searching experience and a new level of self-actualization.<br />I was particularly impressed with the track \\"You Raise Me Up.\\"Backup vocals by a full gospel choir, this song WILL raise you up.It's spirituality is impossible to describe.This track is reminiscent of \\"To Where You Are\\" on the debut album.And like it's predecessor, \\"You Raise Me Up\\" will give you goosebumps everytime.<BR>The first English track on this cd is \\"My Confession\\", and if no other track on Closer moves you, this one certainly will.It's powerful lyrics are merely a backdrop for Josh's exquiste voice.The song will keep you breathless from beginning to end; you'll hit the repeat button at least three times before you're satisfied to leave \\"My Confession\\" behind.<br />The subtle nuances and bufferings in the cd give it polish and pizazz; but without the raw emotion of Groban's vocal acrobatics we would never truly understand the meaning of the word \\"Music.\\"<BR>\\"Closer\\" gives us a glimpse into ourselves and the surrounding world. Indeed, it's one step Closer to heaven on earth.

B00005ASOI|1.0|Wow, this movie was so bad I don't know where to begin.<br />I have read many rave reviews for this movie from critics and movie makers, such as John Carpenter for example. After watching the movie all I can say is, what are they talking about!!!!!!!?<br />There is now way you can tell em this is a classic, it is not even a good movie.<br />Tha acting is laughable!, the story is absurd, nothing feels real. the movie is completely unscary.  It is not possible to have a movie be scary when the acting is laughable and there is no real character development.<br />This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the only reason so many people on here gave this movie a good review is because they think they are supposed to like it because critics and filmakers call it a classic.<br />The only way you can think this is a good movie is if you are a complete and utter moron!<br />Please do not buy this, don't make the same mistake I did and buy this movie based on so many good reviews. Curse all you gave this movie a good review, YOU OWE ME $20.<br />tHE ONLY POSITIVE IN THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT DOES HAVE A GOOD SCORE
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Fallen is a great track in the tradition of the albums that came before it.  The rest of the album, however, runs together like 30 minutes of adlib based on the style of &quot;Angel&quot;.  That wasn't my favorite track and 30 minutes of it, each minute seemingly indistinguishable from the the next, isn't great.  <br />Sarah McLachlan remains the penultimate female vocalist and has clearly in the past demonstrated superior songwriting talent.  At the current rate of one ablbum every six years, however, it looks like we'll be 12 years between great albums.
0385504209|5.0|I had not read any of Mr. Brown's previous book(s) and was not sure what to expect.  Not being erudite enough to express my self in \\"big words\\" like other reviewers, I will just say that I enjoyed the book.  It was somewhat thought provoking; the research into the Knights Templar, DeVinci, Catholicism, etc. seemed well developed.  The hero/heroine could have been a little stronger and villian(s) could have been developed a little more, but all in all, I felt that this was a worth while read.<br />After all, the book is fiction, folks!  Don't you want something quick, fun and a little thought-provoking to read for fun?  Or do you just want spies, sex, blood-and-guts gore?  I thought this book was a good, clean, fun read.
B00005T30L|5.0|Well, sometimes you put together a slice-of-life film about two people who are totally clueless as to how to interact with society.  So, we have this basic theme about self-deemed losers who are are totally unable (or totally unwilling) to adjust to and interact with the \\"Ghost World\\" around them.  <br />On the surface, the two characters couldn't be anymore different, but both have the same motive for their indifferent attitudes towards the purpose of life.  Enid is an immature teenager with a chip on her shoulder, struggling to find any sense of identity, let alone a direction.  She comes from a broken home, living with a father who scarcely knows her.  40-year-old Seymour is more seasoned and is less naïve and more accepting of the way life treats him.   He's an introverted bachelor music-nerd with a slew of unattractive habits and personality traits.  Enid and Seymour are not rebelling from society--they are simply clueless and careless regarding their reputation among others.  They both feel rejected and misunderstood, or as Seymour puts it, `Some people, you just give them a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're satisfied'.  The two of them unite inauspiciously when Enid plays a cruel joke on Seymour, but quickly finds herself inquisitive of the man.  She befriends him, and they hit it off relating to and trying to help each another with their problems.  However, the movie ends with a sense of apathy and despair for both characters.  <br />The supporting characters, with the exception of Enid's girlfriend, are chiefly there to add some badly-needed comedy to a somewhat dragging plot.  The actors have a sharp script to sink their teeth into, with Steve Buschemi being the highlight-everything this man touches turns to gold!  All things considered, a fantastic film that explores the depths of human loneliness and indifference.<br />Thank You
B00003RQNJ|5.0|How often do you hear these words all to describe the same movie? Better yet, how often does it turn out to be true? But \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is all that and more, one of those few wonderful movies that is able to evoke a broad range of honest emotions in its running time of a little less than two hours.<br />The plot concerns the various picaresque adventures of Butch and Sundance, played to perfection by Paul Newman and Robert Redford. But the plot, what there is of it, is really of secondary importance. What's more important is the film's heartfelt, funny, and heartbreaking tribute to the Old West and the relationship between two nonconformists who wanted to stay there.<br />William Goldman's script perfectly captures the Old West's coming of age, but it captures another changing era equally well: that of the 1960's. Many have said the film is dated, I don't believe a word of it. It is most certainly a film from its time, capturing the time period's changes, its hope for a better tomorrow, and its more than occasional paranoia. I think the use of a distinctly 1960's style is not only acceptable, it is essential. The film has many of the markings of a traditional western, both in content and in style--the first color sequence showing Butch and Sundance riding back to the Hole in the Wall Gang looks like it could have come from just about any classic western, as do many other scenes throughout the film. But added to these are touches of modern filmmaking--the use of zooming, the three musical montages, etc. The style is a visual representation of the meeting between the old and the new; The Old West becoming The West, no Old involved. For the same reason, many have condemned the Burt Bachrach score; I praise it. I think the score perfectly underlines Butch and Sundance's breath of life in a seemingly decaying world, and is another wonderful example of the marriage between the Wild West and the Tame West. The \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head\\" sequence perfectly and brilliantly establishes the relationship between the three principles, and, even more, it sets the tone for the entire film. Butch and Sundance are waking up from a dream, a dream they prefer to reality. The bicycle sequence is just one of the picture's many brilliant and entertaining stylistic touches that helps to enhance the characters and tone rather than draw away from them. The cinematography is beautiful, from the opening scenes shot brilliantly in sepia tones to the final, heartbreaking freeze-frame with bullets riddling the soundtrack.<br />In addition to all this, it is fun to watch. These are two real guys we genuinely care about, who we can sympathize with and root for. They are the quintessential likeable underdogs, and words can't describe the acting by Newman and Redford. There are so few movies today that have this classic and stylish sense of fun, few movies that can mix comedy with drama and action with characterization without feeling uneven, and there are so few films currently in theaters that really ENTERTAIN. The movie is melancholy, but it is also full of the joy of life, and is one of those rare movie experiences that leaves you completely uplifted without feeling cheated. There's no emotional manipulation here, because everything rings true with the surprising but inevitable found in great art, and the characters follow their natural, but nonetheless heartbreaking, paths.<br />Keep thinking, indeed, Butch. It's what your best at.
B000089RVR|5.0|Every song on the CD is awesome!! I suggest everyone pick up a copy of the CD!!!
B000006U44|5.0|If I could give this album 6 stars I would.<br />Recorded at a mere 18 years of age, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; proves what absolute talent Kate Bush had.  Yet this is her finest hour, never to be repeated.  Yes, she had some okay moments after this (eg. Babooshka, Army Dreamers) but no other Bush album matches the magic of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;.<br />You will fall in love with:<br />- Oh, to be in love<BR>- Wuthering heights<BR>- The Man with the child in his eyes<BR>- Room for the life<BR>- The dolphin song<BR>- Moving<br />Import it, steal it, borrow it ... do what you must to get hold of it!
B0000CAQ26|4.0|I must say, That I have incredible respect for Pink. She is totally into doing what no one expects her to do, and she ends up doing it well. She Worked with Rancid's Tim Armstrong for a good majority of the songs, and the punk edge that he brings to the new songs is undeniable, and awesome. It totally fits Pinks nicotene coated voice, and her acidic lyrics. Missundaztood was an exploration of her brain, while this album is more of an exploration of her sense of humor. Its more of the surface, which is ok, because she already bared her whole soul. The best song on this whole record, in my opinion is &quot;God is a DJ&quot; It talks about how you just have to do what you can do with what youve been given. Its uplifting and breaking at the same time. The rest of the album looks at different sides of rock, and her first love song, &quot;Love Song&quot; closes the album, and also, wait for the hidden track &quot;Hooker&quot;, which is a hilarious closer to a good album from Pink
B000050HTO|5.0|When my Father found out I was a fan of &quot;the wallflowers&quot; and found out that the lead singer was Bob's son he started to convince me to listen to Bob since (to him)they have similar sounds. I gave in and he bought me this CD. I listened to it once and put it in the back of my CD collection. Later when i was looking for something different to listen to i pulled this CD out. I listened to it carefully and discovered i liked it. Bob pulls the use of lyrics with his voice perfectly. He absolutely amazed me. Most of these songs were written before I was born but I can relate to some. I even looked for other songs by bob. It ruined me from listening to other music because I started comparing it to Bob and we all know nobody can be like Bob. I have a theory that all rock/pop music if you trace back connect to Dylan. It may not be popular music for my generation but I don't care I love it.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Train of Thought doused my worries caused by 6* and brought some new hope as well. To answer the quick questions, (1) Yes it is just as heavy as 6*, (2) No Portnoy does not sing, (3) No, it did not follow in 6*'s experimental footsteps, though it did keep some of it, and (4)The lyrics are at least slightly better than they have been.<BR>The album starts out with a new beginning, a keyboard ascention cut off by Petrucci's signature guitar crunch, which remains the tone throughout the album. Abandoning the accompiament riff used in all of DT's albums, ESPECIALLY SFaM, the crunch isn't unpleasant, simply making DT's tone and atmosphere different than it has been. The rest of the instrumentation follows suit, seeming to follow its Megadeth/Pantera/70s King Crimson roots 75% and its Yes/Queensryche/Genesis/Marillion roots about 25%, which, unlike the unpleasant results on 6*, sound just fine. The massive Rush influence used on 6* is gone also.<BR>Petrucci's pyrotechnics seem normal again, instead of out-of-place and forced in 6*. The lyrics at least TRY to get out of the &quot;I vs. you&quot; drone that 6* fell into trying to be more &quot;mainstream&quot;. Portnoy didn't write any of the lyrics (WOOOOO!) and he didn't sing! However James kept some of the odd vocal effects from 6*, the thin, buzzing one heard at the beginning of &quot;Glass Prison&quot; as well as some new ones. The man even raps in &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;! Is he crazy? But once again, unlike 6*, the result is not dissonant or unpleasant.<BR>Back to the lyrics. They aren't as religious as the titles suggest, the last one IS mildly religious, it's more about the fanaticism of the Middle East and how killing in the name of God is hypocritical. So don't worry, aethiests! You're safe from hearing any &quot;falsities&quot;!<BR>Jordan sounds great whenever he comes in, he's been more subdued since his over-the-top soloing appeared on SFaM. But I LIKED the over-the-top soloing dangit, and it would be fun to hear it here, but his presence here is more textured and fits better with the subdued tone of the whole CD.<BR>John Myung is heard throughout sparingly. He was heard often and to great effect on 6*, and I hoped that they would keep THAT trait instead of some of the others. But alas he goes back to the undercurrent where he was for the rest of DT's career, save for the occasional bass solo.<BR>So in total, Train of Thought reaches forward while holding onto what was good about Dream Theater. While being similar to Awake in its anger-mixed-with-lots-of-heart style, it is still not as literate as I&amp;W, not as atmospheric as Awake, not as metallic as FiI, not as grandiose as SFaM, not as off-kilter as 6*. 6* reached WAY to far and the result was like a dry well of expectation. Train of Thought fills the well again, and will have me coming back to fill my cup with more.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|WTF!?!?!?! That's all I have to say!
B00004Y6NP|4.0|As a blues fanatic, some of the tracks on this album continue to hit the spot: Brothers in arms, Ride across the river, Your latest trick and One world. The rest I could do without. However, I still continue to play the album. Watching Dire Straits play 'Brothers in arms' live at Wembley is still a highlight that moves me every time I watch it.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I first fell in love with C&eacute;line's music from the early '80s when her songs were delightfully bubblegum-poppish (think Visa pour les beaux jours, Amoureuse, Je ne veux pas etc.), and now, listening back on that simpler era full of puppy love and upbeat tempos is a pleasant sort of C&eacute;line nostalgia, but I prefer the strong woman that C&eacute;line has become: accomplished performer, loving wife and mother, as I approach the same stage in my life. \\"1 fille & 4 types\\" shows us again that C&eacute;line's mature talent and creativity have no bounds. She is relaxed, refreshed and radiant here, and this is quickly becoming my favourite C&eacute;line album of the last decade.<br />C&eacute;line returns triumphantly to the Francophone music arena with « 1 fille & 4 types, » her first French album since 1998's S'il suffisait d'aimer. We find C&eacute;line with a new image: short-cropped, mussed hair, wearing a baby tee for Buff's Car Wash, looking older, wiser, and perhaps a bit edgier on the album's cover, surrounded by her four \\"guys\\" from the title: Jacques Veneruso, Erick Benzi, guitarist Gildas Arze and French superstar Jean-Jacques Goldman, who last collaborated with C&eacute;line on D'eux and S'il suffisait d'aimer.<br />The thirteen songs are woven from sheer poetic beauty, by turn gentle and pensive, declarations of love and loss and moving on. There are no belted love anthems here. C&eacute;line is at a point in her life that she brings gravity to the thirteen songs, makes the listener utterly entranced and hooked on each lyric (the songs were co-written by Goldman, Veneruso, and Benzi).<br />The songs occasionally evoke memories of earlier songs, such as Des milliers de baisers (Thousands of Kisses), with a drum intro reminiscent of Pour que tu m'aimes encore or Ne bouge pas, with the bluesy feel of Tous les blues sont &eacute;crits pour toi.  As with D'eux, C&eacute;line and the gang experiment with different musical influences, such as a marked Irish rhythm and tinwhistles on Je lui dirai (I'll Tell Him), a touching declaration of C&eacute;line's love for her young son Ren&eacute;-Charles. Ne bouge pas (Don't Change) evokes Delta Blues with its saucy slide guitar and blues harp, backed by a gospel choir. The bonus song, Valse adieu (Farewell waltz), is a folksy, five-part harmony, with acoustic guitar, and is beautiful, but much too short at a minute and a half.<br />One song, Je t'aime encore, was actually on C&eacute;line's \\"One Heart\\" album (albeit in an English version), but the song (penned by Jean-Jacques Goldman) is truely more powerful in its native tongue.<br />If you don't speak French, don't let that scare you off from experiencing this wonderful album. The emotions of the songs speak for themselves, although if you do speak French or are learning, dust off your dictionary to appreciate the beauty and simplicity of the French lyrics, which I consistently find to be more emotional and poetic than C&eacute;line's English albums. (Also, listening to music is an excellent way to accustom oneself to learning another language.)<br /> \\"1 fille & 4 types\\" is C&eacute;line's most personal, touching work to date and a sure crowd-pleaser for music critics and C&eacute;line fans alike.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|I am still trying to absorb this 70 minute marathon of pure perfection.  There are no words to describe this incredible album.  This is definitely the heaviest DT album ever and just when you think Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci have outdone themselves--SURPRISE--they do it again!  If you are into basic, thoughtless crap like Linkin Park, Korn or Limp Biscuit, do not bother with this album--your feeble minds will tilt!  Anyone out there who appreciates complex, hard core music from the greatest musicians of all time-- BUY THIS CD NOW!!<BR>I will probably do a more detailed review this CD in the future but for now I just want to go listen to it about 3000x more!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Hell's Yeah! For the longest time I said to myself, \\"Self, I enjoy novels of dystopian fascist futures, and John Woo style gunfights, when is someone going to combine the two?\\" Finally someone has done that with the marvel that is Equilibrum. The movie, creates a world that pays homage to dystopian novels, example the ever present T is taken out of Brave New World, and Sean Bean's book is the same tha tthe Protagonist in Farenheit 451 first read. The gunfights are amazing and the swordfight at the end is one of the best I've ever seen (so good I enjoyed it again when I saw the same fight in Underworld a few months ago)'Tis a damn shame this movie bombed at the box office, so do yourself a favor and buy this NOW!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is really a Different release from DT. Darker, heavier, more difficult to grasp, but enchanting. The album title is well chosen because when listening to it, it transports you to a different world. These guys are proving their genius still another time! By the way, I bought the CD yesterday, and I listened to it 7 times from start to end! Notice that As I Am reminded me of Enter Sandman from Metallica, which is really different from the usual out of this world DT music.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Wow...<BR>The first CD is RAWKIN'.<BR>Its the perfect CD for that road trip you were planning.And always...always play it loud.<BR>CD2 is more mellow and yet very intense.<BR>All I can say is that I have waited so long for this one, words fail me.<BR>Thank you Pearl jam!
B00005JMFR|1.0|This movie sucked.  I've been a huge fan of the Matrix series up to this point, but how could anyone screw this movie up so badly?  Why didn't anyone working on it speak up and say \\"this is really going to suck\\"?  90% of the movie was incredible, but the ending seems like they just gave up on thinking.  I only pray that they were just kidding with this one, and they are going to release the real ending in a couple of weeks.
B000000H7I|5.0|But why on earth are you angry at a God that you don't believe exists and why do rely on yourself when you clearly state that you can't do this. The lyrics are good arguments, but they make little to no sense because he basically contradicts himself, which is the sure sign that these guys are confused. Now musically this band rulez, one of the heaviest bands on earth! The vocals, man the vocals are to die for. Wow! Possibly the best deathmetal vocalist on earth! Fans of this should check out some heavier stuff like Crimson Thorn, Disencumbrance, Detrimental, and Vomitorial Corpulence. Check em out. Best track is Infecting the Crypts.
B00005AQE8|5.0|1996, one of the last year's of Hip-Hop's finest. This was the year when the greatest rapper of all time made his best work, Hip-Hop's first double disc &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. This is in my opinion the best Hip-Hop album, or atleast that I have heard. The first dics is the better of the two. It contains all the hits from the album such as &quot;How Do you Want it&quot; &quot;California Love&quot; my favorite &quot;I Ain't Mad at Cha&quot; &quot;2 of America's Most Wanted&quot; along with others. The 2nd disc is more party jams featuring various members of the outlaws along with other unknown acts. This is the only reason this isn't the perfect album, there are too many bad guest apperences which take away from Pac. When Pac is on the mic, he raps about the thug life keeping his rhymes simple and smart, he doesn't have too many mind blowing rhymes which make you rewind the tape, but he keeps it consistent throughout the album. Overall, Pac somehow was able to eclipse the classic &quot;Me Against the World&quot; and make a fantastic party album, if you do not have this album, I suggest you go get it.
B00001NFCY|3.0|Creed's Human Clay starts off good,with even quite a few enjoyable songs, but after a while they all start to sound the same. Human Clay is still a good album though with Higher, Beatiful, and With Arms Wide Open, as highlights of the album. Pretty enjoyable for the right price.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I have an unhealthy dislike for the White Stripes. I think they are awful and they represent everything that is wrong with music today-- i.e. talentless and nothing but image. There is really no distinction between the White stripes and Britany Spears in this regards-- neither is original, neither is talented, and both are nothing more than a superficial image. The White Stripes' melodies are simplistic and hackneyed; their lyrics are juvenille; and they are inept musicians-- especially the drummer. Their music is unoriginal and recycled. Beyond the music, their &quot;schtick&quot; is as annoying as their music: promoting the ambiguities about their past, their stupid white and red outfits, and their self-characterization as &quot;minimalism&quot;, which is really just &quot;code&quot; for simplistic and talentless. I also think they are incredible hypocrits. For example, they always talk about how &quot;alternative&quot; they are and how &quot;anti-mainstream&quot; they are, yet there they are in Rolling Stone and Spin and on Jay Leno. The Strokes, the Vines, the Hives-- all of these bands suck-- but the White Stripes are the absolute worst.  DON&quot;T BELIEVE THE HYPE!
B000001Y42|1.0|A disappointment as far as i'm concerned, who's idea was it to combine rap and metal anyway? Not that all of it is bad,but the combination here doesn't do anything for me. They cover George Michael's Faith, I like what they've done with that song, other than that a dull album, what for a complation.
B000089RVR|4.0|When Dido first became popular she was recognized mostly as being the sampled vocal on Eminem's &quot;Stan,&quot; this of course made the curious check out her debut album &quot;No Angel&quot; which sold into the millions. That first album introduced Dido as a skilled artist who not only had a wonderful voice, but also the talent to co-write some catchy, deep songs. Here Dido, like Michelle Branch, proves she is no fluke and can expand and grow. Most great albums, or at least great songs, seem to flow out of the artist's personal zone, events and moods in their lives will influence the material and this is the case with &quot;Life For Rent.&quot; &quot;No Angel&quot; was an optimistic view over-all, it was about loving and being loved, but with &quot;Life For Rent&quot; Dido decides to explore the realms of heartbreak more. This of course, is due to the fact that she broke-up from her fiance. Dido's gift, like rocker Scott Weiland, is taking the event in her life and making it into a good song. Consider the opener, &quot;White Flag,&quot; a melodic tune with a classic vibe, is a direct statement about the hardships of breaking up and refusing to let go. &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is also a gloomy theme, but with a nice melody. Few artists have excelled at making a sad day sound so damn good like Dido. &quot;Mary's In India&quot; sounds like a page out of her personal diary, the final lyrics are a nice wordplay on the structure of the lyrics that came earlier in the song. &quot;See You When You're 40&quot; is a curious try at throwing-in some quasi-techno feel but it proves Dido's vocals can soar over the beats. &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is a good sophomoric effort, what it's missing is the feeling and catchiness or just plain memorable atmosphere of &quot;No Angel.&quot; There aren't any haunting songs in the tradition of &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot; or &quot;Hunter.&quot; The daring, larger scope of the previous album is missed. But still, Dido manages to come back to the spotlight with an album that still has moments of great musical ability, it isn't a disappointing album as many second tries turn out to be. The production is still well-done, the orchestral flourishes are great ear-candy and that unique voice still conveys real feelings. &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is worth checking out.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Silver Side Up is an awesome hard rock album. The opener Never Again is a great way to open an album, it's a heavy song, that introduces what most of the remainder of the album will sound like. The only song that's really not heavy is This is how your remind me, The sound of the album and songs may not very that much,but that is part of what I like about the album,having a signature sound is more pleasing to me than,groups that have a variety of sounds because they aren't sure who their audience is. If you're familiar with Never Again or Too BAd from the radio, then with Silver Side Up you are getting the sound that you would expect, rather than a gutless album with no distinctive sound. Also, the album is very solid, the songs are great and the album has great flow!!! If you like your rock without rap mixed in I recommend this to you, even my mom likes this album!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Fallen is a song up to par musically speaking, lyrically not as much growth as I would expect in a 6 years... Trainwreck has some good music, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. The rest of the songs aren't too memorable. I have to wonder where is the songwriting talent that gaves us:<br />I Will Remember You, Angel, Building A Mystery, Do What you Have to Do, Adia, Possession, Elsewhere<br />Sarah just has lost her muse. Hopefully when she gets the critical(bad) feedback on this album from us her fans, she will understand she didn't do so well this time and it will drive her to really search deep for better lyrics. Also it would be better if her less ablum was less wall-of-sound-ish, you know what I mean.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I'm sure everyone knows the plot, so I'll skip it and go on to the finer details.<br />The song / dance pieces blended very naturally into the film's flow and dialog. This was greatly enhanced by the fact that the cast members performed all the songs and dances themselves. The greatest surprise was John C. Reilly's performance of &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;, even though lately he seems to be type cast as the not - too -intelligent husband...<br />The only thing I didn't like was Ren&eacute;e Zellweger. Before starting, I admit I never liked her as an actress - I don't think she just isn't that good.. Like in Chicago - unlike Catherine Zeta Jones, who surprised many viewers with her singing &amp; dancing ability, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's voice can best be described as... annoying. Even as the supposed 'star' of the movie, she was easily  overshadows by her co stars (Zeta Jones, Queen Latifah).
B00009TB5G|3.0|Hello readers. First off i would like to say that I saw The Two Towers in the theaters before i read the book. And having completed the LOTR trilogy before the third movie came out TTT does no justice to the book- to an extent. The acting in my opinion is top notch. They cast most of the roles perfectly in my opinion. The scenery is beautiful as it was in FOTR. Exceptional CGI in some areas of the film. And this is the point where I start to complain about several aspects of this film. First off the additional scenes with Arwen/ Aragorn are utter CRAP. There was no need for them in this movie whatsoever. The scene where Merry/Pippin convince Treebeard to take them past Isengard and then he discovers what Saruman has done is ridiculous as well. Treebeard knew well before what Saruman was up to. And finally(and most most MOST disappointing) in this movie was the character Faramir. Peter Jackson being such a \\"lover of Tolkien\\" should smack himself and his writers for bringing Faramir to the screen the way they did. OK Im done. <br />Alright movie overall... if Peter Jackson would have just stuck more to the book which he could have done instead of adding cheesy love scenes, the flashback scenes with Elrond and Galadriel and complete story changes it could have been amazing.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This Oscar-winning movie shows us a 1920's Chicago where booze and jazz fuel people's dreams and disappointments.  Roxy Hart is one of them.  Bored with her life, she dreams of fame on the stage of musical theater.  She has an affair with someone who promises to get her into the theater, but it turns out to be a lie of seduction.  Enraged by this deception and humiliation, Roxy murders the liar.  Ironically, it's this murder which launches her on her way to the fame she always wanted.  After she retains the services of the genius criminal lawyer, Bill Flynn, it's showtime.  Billy remolds Roxy and manipulates the press like a supernatural puppetmaster.  Roxy finally achieves the fame she wished for, but she learns about the transitory nature of fame.<br />I think this is very relevant to American society today.  We can explore the issues of injustice in the criminal system, the issue of fame in America, and the tendancy of the American press to repeat whatever is fed to it.  You get the impression that those who have money, or those who have a telent for manipulating people will have no trouble escaping from justice, whereas those who have no voice in the world, as represented by the Hungarian woman who was executed, will never get the justice they deserve.  It's important to watch this to get a feel of where American society is going.<br />Getting back to the movie itself, it is just spectacular.  It's perhaps one of the best musical movies ever produced.  THey split the story between the real world and a fantasy stage.  When they do a musical number, it shifts to the fantasy stage, so there isn't an unnatural feel when they do the musical numbers.  All of the actors give fine performances, and the songs and choreography are top notch.  You'll watch it again and again.  I know I can't stop.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is just a classic.  When music history is written, this one'll be there. I'm not exactly the world's biggest rap fan, but I do own this one (along with alot of Too Short &amp; Eazy E) ....and I've known a lot of others who weren't fans of most rap, but were partial to the stylings of the Dogg. How can you not be?? A must-have. :)
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah took 6 years off, and took many years to write these songs. It has paid off. Afterglow is a wonderful collections of songs written by Sarah, one of the most amazing artists and lyricists of our time. Im so proud to call her a fellow Canadian. <BR>From beginning to end Afterglow takes you on an emotional jouney, with at least one song that everyone can relate to. Some of my favorite tracks, 'Fallen', 'Stupid', and 'Answer' are songs I could listen to over and over again. I predict that her song 'Answer' will be as emotional and memorable as Angel and I Will Remember You are. It leaves you in tears when you listen to it. <BR>This is the one CD I have been waiting for all year long, and it has not been dissapointing. Thank you Sarah.
0802136834|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim. I am, by no means, a history buff. However, through the 600-page epic I became enthralled as a history of PEOPLE came forward, not merely a presentation of FACTS. These names that we've all heard for years--Henry VIII, his various wives, etc--became more than just dates, names, and stereotypes, but actual people. They become 3-dimentional with their strengths empasized as much as their weaknesses. The details of their motives come to light as much as their factual acts. It is a sublime combination of accurate historical fact and exciting storytelling. Ms. Weir has secured another avid reader and learner.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Given the choice between a comic book adaptation that's dark and deep and one that's wafer-thin, I'll take seriousness and depth. Too many recent superhero fantasies have involved by-the-numbers stories dappled with computer-generated graphics.<br /> But, man, Ang Lee's &quot;The Hulk&quot; requires way too much heavy lifting for your basic monster movie.<br /> In telling the story of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a scientist transformed by his experiments into a big green behemoth, Lee gets a lot right. The colors and camera angles and production design neatly evoke the Marvel Comics renderings of Jack Kirby; the blunt, stark dialogue all but floats over the characters' heads in \\"word balloons\\"; and an array of split-screens, wipes and dissolves replicate the panels of a comic book, even if they are overused and distracting.<br /> The crucial element that's missing, however, is fun. There's not a drop of fun in this long, low movie. There's no sense of adventure or wonder, which is the core of any fantasy. Instead, by filling the plot with lots of half-baked psychology about Bruce's evil dad David (Nick Nolte), Lee and screenwriter James Schamus have transformed \\"The Hulk\\" into a bland allegory about bad family ties. If they had injected just a little hope and humor into the story, it might not have mattered that the title character is obviously a digital effect. But they didn't, and \\"The Hulk\\" is clearly just an artificial creature.
B0000640VO|5.0|Summary<BR> Once upon a time Amelie Poulin, a young lady unlike any other, lived in the heart of Paris.  She underwent various difficulties in life such as witnessing the death of her mother in front of the Notre Dame church due to a woman who committed suicide from the heights of the church and landed on her. As well as having to hear her father endlessly talk about his obsession with a garden dwarf statue, she decides to leave this depressing home and live in Montmartre working as a waitress in a petit café.  At the age of 22, Amelie finds her purpose in life, which is fixing other's lives.  She invents all sorts of strategies to help people incognito.<BR> Her mission is suddenly disturbed by the sight of a strange man, Nino Quincampoix, who works part time in a haunted house and in a sex-shop.  He collects fractions of pictures found under photo-taking machines in the metro. Amelie is suddenly romantically moved for the first time, and decides to play a little hide-and-seek with Nino... Oh la la!<BR> <br />Movie Review<BR>Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulin, a truly delicious piece of eye candy, coming from the sweet heart of Paris, wrapped up in an innocent story of a young mademoiselle named Amelie.  Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet; starring well known Audrey Tautou as Amelie, and Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincompoix who give the movie zing of Parisian flavor and fantasy.   <BR>Amelie, at the age of 22 decides to leave her home and strike out on her own; tired of the conflicts she is surrounded by in her childhood home.  She moves into a small Montmartre apartment, the epitome of French living, and thus begins an interesting adventure, of a girl's self-imposed mission to change others lives.  <BR>The choice of Audrey Tatou an actress with her own magical qualities was the perfect choice for leading role in the movie; truly embodying the character of this innocent and naive yet mystical girl. Rather than making her role one of a outlandish child, she portrays the magic and imagination that this movie offers in a smooth manner.  Mathieu Kassovitz is the perfect complementary actor to Audrey as he portrays a nonsensical character with his own peculiar personality.  Queer characters, up and out of the normal perspective, make this a dramatic yet romantic comedy unlike any other.  Giving everyone a distinct story, filled with details, and a history, and broadening the horizon for an appealing cinematic work.<BR>Jean-Pierre Jeunet uses special effects throughout the movie sparingly, making each one have an important role in the meaning of the movie.  For example, when Amelie literally turns to water as she thinks about Nino because she is hopelessly in love.  These small details not only make an impact on the audience, yet give the movie a variety of symbols.  The camerawork helps the movie, making it in some way unrealistic which is what Amelie Poulain is all about.  The director uses quick-cuts, and a wide spectrum of colors, depending on the mood of the moment creating a film that the viewer can appreciate visually, through the character's gests and also through the well thought out shades of colors throughout the movie.<BR>Besides visual effects, music plays an important role in the mood of the film, offering whimsical and melancholy notes.  The music is brought together by the synchronized sound of accordion, piano and guitar, giving the movie emotions through sound. As well as offering feelings it also gives the movie a typical Parisian scene, mixed in with the sight of the most fabulous neighborhood in Paris, Montmartre.  <BR>Voila!  Amelie Poulin, a film leaving all ages with cheek pain due to over-smiling and laughing throughout the movie. Such imagination and enchanting qualities feed the eyes of the audience with a different film, one that reaches cinematographic summits, and take minds on a 2 hour escape to candy land.  Encore!
0790729601|1.0|I don't know what these other people were watching.  Maybe they are all lobbyists for organizations within California that are trying to pimp Arnold.  Whatever the deal, the fact remains that this is hardly a watchable flick.  The explosions are crummy, the plot is nothing short of a hurried scrawl written on three pieces of toilet paper and the acting is typical of every other Schwarzenegger movie during this time frame.  Don't watch it, don't even recommend it.  In fact if you own it, do us all a favor and burn it.
B00009MEJU|1.0|One of this movie's defenders poses a question (reproduced below). The question may have been asked with rhetorical intent, but I think it deserves an answer anyway.<br />The question:<br />\\"Like the title of Shakespeare's play are the reviews that have made much of Clooney's 'unveiling.' I don't understand why a brief shot of a nude George Clooney during a sex scene with a, theoretically, nude actress in a movie that focuses on a love affair between a man and a woman would be understood as gratuitous. How many times do the sheets slip and a shot of so and so's perfect breast peep through? People are, often times but not always, naked while having sex. No, we don't have to see it to understand it, but if it's brief and part of the story, then a quick shot of someone's rear end, thigh (which we see a lot of Clooney's, and which I, quite honestly found more interesting), breast, ankle, or toes unsheathed seems perfectly in-line with the moment, the story, the act, ect. Is it just that a man's rear is shocking? Is it Clooney's in particular? Without belaboring the point, it seems that men's parts are gratuitous and women's critical to films. How absurd.\\"<br />The answer: <br />First let's clear up two misconceptions: 1) The couple are not \\"having sex\\". They are lying prone side by side on a bed and having an animated discussion. The woman is presumably naked herself, but Mr. Clooney is closer to our side of the bed, and all we see of her is her head. 2) One person's \\"lengthy\\" may be another's \\"brief\\", but it is a distortion to call this a \\"shot\\". It is not a \\"shot\\"; it is a scene, a prolonged scene.<br />Now, why is it, not just gratuitous, but particularly gratuitous? Because the entire scene is shown with a wide-angle view: We see Mr. Clooney from head to toe, yet the action for the entire duration of the scene has entirely and only to do with his and his girl friend's heads. Instead of focusing on these heads (nothing else on screen is moving), the camera, for the entire scene, is focusing on Mr. Clooney's buttocks.<br />Don't mistake me: I have no serious objection to gratuitous male or female nudity in a movie. On the contrary what bothers me about this scene is the utter crudeness of its attempt to disguise its gratuitousness. It is, like pretty much all of the movie, heavy-handed, clumsy, and inept. In fact, I was no less annoyed by Mr. Soderburgh's heavy-handed, clumsy, and inept attempt gratuitously to inject theology into Stanislaw Lem's plot--but that's another story.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This is an AWESOME CD collection.  I was elated to see Trapped on here.  The only regret I have with this CD collection is that Johnny 99 is not on here.  The Boss more than compensated with his other classics like Darkness on the Edge of Town, Jungleland and Blinded By The Light.  This is A MUST for fans of The Boss!<br />Way to go Bruuuuuuuuuce!!
B0000VD04M|5.0|Wow. What an amazing, lyrical homage from Tim Burton. Known for his love of oddball characters and misfits, Burton turns his empathic eye toward the man who's been roundly labeled \\"The Worst Director of All Time\\". But in Wood's mind, played with sincerity and humor by Johnny Depp, he is a true artist because he actually believes that his films are good. A refreshing breeze of naivete in today's world of hyper-bloated blockbusters, sequels and video-game-to-screen eye candy.<br />And Martin Landau's Bela Lugosi is by turns invigorating and touching as the horror icon made human, and one of the first Hollywood has-beens from the talkies era. Burton depicts his sad descent into addiction and obscurity as more of a horror than anything Lugosi ever committed to the silver screen.<br />Excellent performances by all; my favorite being Bill Murray as the deliciously effete Galactic Ruler in \\"Plan 9\\". Howard Shore once again delivers an astonishingly poetic and moving musical score, proving that he is one of the most versatile and gifted composers since John Williams.<br />I recently had the pleasure of watching this film on the big screen, confirming my intention to add \\"Ed Wood\\" to my DVD library.
B0000AI44Q|3.0|First of all, I love this record's production. It has that stripped-down, live-in-the-studio vibe that is sadly lacking in so many of today's painfully slick, overproduced, digital cut-and-paste rock recordings. Rock and Roll was never supposed to be perfect, anyway!<br />Speaking of perfect, this record is far from it. At times the lyrics border on embarassing and the music sounds tired and uninventive. Some tunes just seem to run on forever. One thing I've always admired about Young's best writing is his uncanny ability to convey complex emotions and situations with an economy of words. On many of these songs, I feel that he could have cut out about half of the verses and still have been able to tie the story together. The narrative just ends up weighing this record down. Like some others here, I got pretty tired of hearing about grandpa and the \\"Double E\\". I know its a musical novel, but it got to the point where I didn't really care what happened to the characters.<br />That said, there are some high points too. \\"Falling From Above\\" has a beautiful melody and guitar part that, to an extent, recalls \\"Powderfinger\\". \\"The Devil's Sidewalk\\" has a nasty repetitive blues riff and some cool lead guitar breaks and \\"Be The Rain\\" is prime Neil Young & Crazy Horse in every way. Its worth picking up this CD just for these three songs alone.<br />To be fair, you have to give Neil Young credit for continuing to ignore musical trends and instead making the kind of music he wants to make. The problem is that the kind of music he wants to make is not always the kind I want to listen to.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Believe the hype. The film is a masterpiece. Period. And one movie everyone must experience.<br />I'll comment instead on the extras, particularly Roger Ebert's incredibly informative and engaging commentary. He loves movies, loves &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and it shows. He loads it with anecdotes, educational information, and not a few spoilers on the special effects and goofs. Ebert presents what amounts to an excellent Citizen Kane 101 lecture where the film, and not the lecturer, takes center stage. Nice job.<br />Unfortunatley, Peter Bogdanovich's commentary is sub-par. When he's not name-dropping (&quot;When I met Orson... I asked Orson&quot; blah blah), he suffers from the annoying tendency to recount what's on the screen. <br />And the rest of the extras are excellent too. Great DVD transfer.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is just another masterpiece from the boys in DT.  In a day in age where \\"Nu Metal\\" is so in, DT comes in and proves that they can be just as heavy as the next band in this world of \\"Nu-Metal\\" and do it better.  I love the fact that this band is still on top of they're game because I absolutely love the music that they create and they have never let me down.  Unlike some bands (METALLICA)!!!  The lyrics are unbelievable too.  Between John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy writing skills this album is nothing short of a classic.  Uncontrollable talent here a must own for any fan of DT or Prog-Metal, of screw it just Metal in general.  Buy this and you will not regret it!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|There's no doubt that Room on Fire has been one of the most highly anticipated (and hyped!) albums of 2003. The question everyone will be asking is is it worth it? The answer is YES. For those who loved Is this it? You can expect more of The Strokes raspy vocals, catchy choruses, jangly guitars, and erratic, rapid-fire drum beats. In bringing Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich to the table they have created a fuller sound without sacrificing the lo-fi origins that fans loved on the first record. Where most bands buy keyboards and call it the next step in their evolution, the Strokes have added them with a subtlety that always retains their signature sound. Throw in a few handclaps and youve got Room on Fire. Those who are expecting a giant progression will be disappointed. Room on Fire is pretty much a continuation of Is This It? And why should that be such a bad thing? My only complaint is the short running time (just over 30 mins.) but lets not be greedy and hopefully a third album is not another two-year wait.

B0000CD5I6|5.0|I do not know how the new Jethro Tull album is in music respect because I have simply not listened it yet. I believe it is very good. <BR>However, I have to say that the front cover of the album has made a good impression on me. It reminds me good-old-Jethro Tull from the past and unforgettable albums like: \\"Aqualung\\", \\"Thick As A Brick\\", \\"A Passion Play\\", \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\", \\"Heavy Horses\\" or \\"Songs From The Wood\\". <BR>I always admire Jethro Tull albums' covers. They are always related with subject of an album, well-thought-out and in good taste.<BR>In my opinion it is something more than only a piece of paper with printed a name of a group and title of an album on it. It is a work of art. <BR>Look at the snowy view - isn't it beautiful?<BR>[Five stars - for the cover]<br />A Jethro Tull fan from Poland<BR>- CHRIS -

B00008EY9G|1.0|John Cusack is always great, Rebecca DeMornay's few minutes onscreen are well done, and Ray Liotta delivers as expected, but I'm really surprised they all agreed to work on this film. What a disappointment. Anytime you find yourself laughing when yet another character is murdered in some tired old horror movie fashion, it's time to hit the stop button. Even when you realize that everyone with a room key is going to die, it isn't suspenseful or even an issue because you don't really like them anyway, and they certainly don't care much about each other. The &quot;plot twist&quot; at the end is a total cop out and fairly predictable. (Wasn't it 20 years ago that Bobby dreamed an entire season of Dallas?) Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I'd watched the alternative ending(s), but the final version was more than enough for me.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I love Pearl Jam, let me get that out of the way right now.  This double album of assorted B-Sides and Rarities satisfies every point throughout the band's remarkable career.  From Ten B-sides all the way up until last year's Riot Act, Lost Dogs serves to introduce songs that never made it to an official Pearl Jam album, but still represent their distinctive sound and unbelievable talent. I highly suggest even the most casual fans to buy this, and hardcore fans I am certain already own it by now.  Also, everyone should buy Live at the Garden, I hear it's amazing, too bad it was sold out at the store I tried.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park's second studio effort (not counting the 2002 remix album Reanimation) overflows with glossy production values and Big Rock oomph, fully embracing the pop instincts of their Hybrid Theory debut. For many, Theory sounded inexcusably corporate, from its too-timely rap-rock sound to the long list of product endorsements included in the liner notes. Meteora will only amplify those complaints, but this album is actually truer to the band's nature. It's still impossible not to hear strains of Limp Bizkit , Korn , Rage Against the Machine , and the like. None of those acts, however, would try something as blatantly anthemic as &quot;Easier to Run,&quot; which would sound fine to a Def Leppard fan, or as borderline danceable as &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; and &quot;Session.&quot; Linkin Park is what Trent Reznor was always afraid of becoming, but if you ever wished he would drop the pretenses and just make a hair-metal record, you'll find Meteora to your liking. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!
B00005JM0B|3.0|Kristanna Loken, while cute, was horrible in this movie.  Arnold in the first Terminator was menacing in a large and powerful way.  Robert Patrick, the BEST Terminator, was so calm and had such an evil penetrating stare that he was just great.  Not to mention, he was able to show emotion in order to interact with human beings.  Kristanna shows nothing but a straight face (except for her weird orgasmic look when she discovered John Connor's blood at the pet hospital)and does not play up on her sexuality.  If you're going to make a female terminator that looks gorgeous, allow her to act like it.  It would have been better off if they had cast former wrestler Chyna as the Terminator instead, because that is all they used Kristanna as.  They did not allow her to play up her beauty, which is the whole reason they hired her to begin with.<BR>     The story also could have been a little  better.   And for the military to have its targeting codes and nuclear arsenal available ONLINE is ridiculous.  How incompetant would we have to be to do something like that?  <BR>     The bottom line is that James Cameron pretty much shut the book on the series in the second movie and they wanted to do whatever they could to revive it.  While I was very happy to see a third Terminator movie, and I thought it was a decent film, the subpar story (coupled with Kristanna Loken's hideous performance) made for only an average movie.  Three stars.
B00005JMFR|2.0|This movie was exactly that - just a movie.  The underlying philosophy barely exists, half of the events in these movies don't make sense, and \\"Reloaded\\" may as well have been a video game.  For those of us who appreciate decent film, this movie is less than satisfactory.  For those of you who appreciate sensationalist manufactured computer generated nonsense, this movie is perfect for you.  I admit, I had fun, but it wasn't worth my nine dollars.  And at the end - no, the possibility for a sequel does not exist.  The end of war is peace, and that's what humanity got.  By the way, the acting was sub-par.  And the best example of a monologue in this film is Agent Smith's \\"chilling\\" interrogation at the end of the film.  In the end, the Wachowski brothers simply got together some drugs, an intro to philosophy textbook, and some computers.  \\"The Matrix\\" series is the result.  Also, the entire series is a downward spiral.  The acting does deteriorate, the dialogue is wretched, and to put it simply, the Wachowski brothers let success go to their heads.  A concept such as the Matrix should not be spoiled by senseless action.  Alas, such is Hollywood I guess.
B00003CX8J|4.0|X-Men was a great movie in my mind.  It may not have followed the comic completely, but people have to realize that is going to happen when you have hundreds of individual X-Men titles and only a two hour movie.  I do not care that Angel and Beast where not in the movie, or that Iceman was just a kid.  The only characters I missed were Gambit and Psylocke.  Wolverine is the most popular X-Men character, which makes sense why the film (and the second one) revolves around him, but I think they did a great job in making all of the other characters individuals as well, and not just there.  And for all the people who disagreed with Ian McKellan as Magneto I just have to say that I too did not think it was a good casting choice to begin with, but I quickly changed my mind upon seeing the movie.  McKellan is a superb Magneto.  For those who complained that he was too old, do not forget that Magneto was a teenager during World War II back in the early 1940s.  He WOULD be in his late 60s early 70s at this point (McKellan himself is 64 and was born in 1939, the year the war BEGAN).  Do not be led astray by Magneto's youthful appearance in the comics.  He is an old man.<BR>     In close I just have to say that the best is yet to come in the X-Men world.  As cool as I think Magneto is, I believe the better X-Men villains, Mr. Sinister and Apocalypse, will make for an even better movie.
B00005NKKY|3.0|I will never be able to fathom why this album is considered to be their greatest.  It isn't.  It doesn't even come close to the breath-taking PARSLEY, SAGE, ROSEMARY AND THYME, their previous album.  I consider that one to be the greatest album ever released by anyone ever.  But BOOKENDS is not without it's charm.<BR>The disappointments on here are &quot;Overs&quot;, &quot;Voices Of Old People&quot;, &quot;Punky's Dilemma&quot;, &quot;Old Friends&quot; and &quot;At The Zoo&quot;.  These songs just don't have the trademark splendor that S&amp;G's music usually had.  But the good tracks more than make up for it: &quot;Bookends Theme&quot; contains the most haunting notes that I've ever heard on an acoustic guitar, and the version with vocals definitely wins my vote for best song on the album.  &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; is known by everyone, but it's not all that great.  I never saw what the big deal was, it just sounds like an average pop song to me.  Anyway, &quot;Save The Life Of My Child&quot; is a total trip.  Those eerie sound effects and that weird synthesizer make it a real psychedelic experience.  Oh, and if you listen closely, after the second or third verse, you can hear Garfunkel reciting a line from &quot;The Sound Of Silence&quot; (I think).  &quot;America&quot; is also overrated but a very pleasant song.  I personally hate the line &quot;Toss me a cigarette, there's one in my overcoat...We smoked the last one an hour ago&quot;.  Just sounds corny.  &quot;Fakin' It&quot; is excellent, and the upbeat &quot;A Hazy Shade Of Winter&quot; is one of my favorite S&amp;G tunes.  And the bonus track &quot;You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies&quot; is marvelous.  Great lead vocal by Artie, who may be the greatest singer that ever lived.<BR>So I consider this album to be very overrated, although it still has some great moments.  But if you're looking for the most beautiful, comforting music in the world, then get PARSLEY, SAGE, ROSEMARY AND THYME.  It will leaveyou speechless.
0805047905|5.0|We first read this book at a friends house, and I fell in love with it!  My kids loved it when I made a different voice for every animal.  We were at a birthday party and before long every child there (from ages one to six) was completely involved in the story!
0679731725|4.0|A butler (Mr. Stevens) close to retirement reflects his convictions and life while traveling the countrysides of England during a 6-day holiday granted by his new, American master. The official purpose for his journey is to seek out a particular candidate, a certain Miss Kenton, who had worked under him before, to fill an open maid position. His real mission, arguably, which he does not discuss overtly, was to see for himself how she was doing. Stevens refers to her as Miss Kenton in his mind yet addresses her as Mrs. Benn when he actually gets to see her.<br />What is it that makes life worth living? Stevens in his youth seeked perfection in his occupation -- for this he had sacrificed his best years and proximity from his father. Diginity, he says, differentiates great butlers from the merely good. With all earnestness he strived to become a butler with dignity, a truly great butler. With his best years and biggest accomplishments behind him, he sits down and thinks: Was it all that worthwhile?<br />What Stevens speaks of do not necessary coincide with reality (reality including the state of his heart). Not to say that he was trying to deceive. What he speaks of, in my opinion, was what he wanted to believe in (was his employer, Lord Darlington, really fault-free in his view?), or what he perceived as the right way to think (is it not honorable to place one's duty before everything else?). There is a subtle incongruity between reality and Stevens' representation of reality that is ultimately left to the reader to resolve. I think I have found my answers to this disparity in the very last pages of the book.

0790734060|5.0|This may be the perfect film, (I know I said pretty much the same thing about \\"Charade\\", but...) This is one of the few deserving films to actually receive the Academy Awards (r) that were mandated for it! Unlike \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"2001\\", \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"The Lion In Winter\\", \\"Amadeus\\" received all the meaningful awards it rightly deserved!<br />This is a story of envy, covetousness and Machiavellian machinations by a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Antonio Salieri, who had the misfortune to be greatly disappointed by his young hero on first meeting. This meeting stayed with him for the rest of his life, as he plotted from his second meeting to rid the Viennese court of \\"the creature\\"!<br />F. Murray Abraham is a revelation in the role of Salieri, relishing every little snarl and curse at Tom Hulce's Mozart and cackling with glee at every triumph, real or imagined, playing the young AND the old Salieri as if he was a spirit ressurrecting Salieri's original corpse. Dick Smith's aging make-up is flawless, making it very easy to believe that Abraham is seventy+ years old as he parlays the role.<br />The movie starts in an insane asylum where a fey young priest visits the decripit Salieri, who has recently attempted suicide. It is implied from the onset that Salieri feels a massive guilt for having \\"killed\\" Mozart through exhaustion and overwork. \\"MOZART!! Forgive your assassin! I confess...I KILLED you, Mozart! I KILLED you....!\\"... The very first lines you hear after a massive Beethovenish chord is sounded at the start of the film.<br />He goes on to tell the priest the story of himself and Mozart in the Viennese court of Emperor Joseph of Austria, portrayed here as an empty-headed fop by the recently notorious Jeffrey Jones. As the prodigal Mozart is about to be introduced to Joseph, Salieri, operatic director Count Orsini Rosenberg, Kappelmeister Bono and the visiting Baron Von Swieten, they are shocked to see him as an immature, cocky, obnoxious little boy, rather than the dignified matured prodigy they expected. Salieri is especially disappointed since he had worshipped Mozart when he was younger and emulated him all his life, achieving the rank of Court Composer through the inspiration of this admiration. He had even written a processional piece for Mozart's entrance especially for the reception, only to have Mozart tear it apart as repetitive and derivative, cackling at him with that irritating howl of a trademark laugh.<br />From this moment on, Salieri and Mozart were bitter enemies, although Mozart doesn't realize it. He actually sees Salieri as an ally against the directors of Joseph's musical court, who constantly thwart Mozart's attempts at livening up the moribund Viennese musical zeitgest.<br />In the end, as Mozart realizes that he may never attain true riches, partly due to the behind-the-scenes startegies of Salieri and Rosenberg, he grabs at anything that will provide food and a roof over the heads of his young wife and son. Enter, finally, Salieri, disguised as the image of Mozart's late father, to request a requiem mass for a \\"deserving soul\\". Little does Mozart realize that the \\"deserving soul\\" is himself!<br />Maybe the ONLY thing askew about this incredible film is the odd miscasting of Mozart and Emperor Joseph....Tom Hulce bears NO resemblance to Wolfgang A. Mozart! However, Jeffrey Jones, who portrays the emperor, is the spit and image of him. Perhaps they should have checked to see if Andr&eacute; Previn, (who looks JUST like him), had a lookalike son or nephew! (However, Hulce  pretty much owns the role as Abraham owns Salieri. His portrayal of Mozart as a complete horse's ass is perfect for Peter Schaeffer's purposes.) Elizabeth Berridge's Constanza Mozart is cute and Berridge assays her as a type of person that American audiences would be immediately comfortable with, a kind of eighteenth century \\"Shirley Feeney\\". The poor girl's career, however, went nowhere after this, as did the careers of just about everybody ELSE in it, except for Jeffrey Jones, and even HIS is probably now kaput, due to his own grave mistakes.<br />The sense of humor and the acting of even supernumeraries in the production has to be seen to be believed.

B00008H2LB|2.0|I like Linkin Park's first release. It was good, catchy, I could maybe believe the manufactured angst in the songs but all in all it was a good CD with many high points. Meteora just doesnt have the same spark that kicked me in the pants that their first one did. Sure the songs are more well crafted with keyboards and such but it seems to me that they dont have that same motivation. Where as the angst worked the first time around, this time I just dont believe it.  Maybe it's their sudden rise to success, but one things for sure, Meteora is certainly a more commercially appealing radio-friendly CD. Too bad. I think it could have been much better.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen.  Usually I rate movies in terms of how they do compared with my expectations, but even if i expected the worst, i would have hated this movie.  I expected this movie to be an OK movie, entertaining but stupid and cheesy (spider man...).  It was nothing short of awful.  The plot took forever to develop, there was too much wierd scifi stuff, etc.  The special effects were very good, but they did not translate into enteraining action sequences.  I truly hated this movie and as a result will never see another comic book inspired moive again.
B00005JMFI|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I was laughing so hard, I was crying. Ferrell is over the top with his enthusiasm for the Christmas spirit. It is appropriate for families, too. I can't recommend this movie enough.
B00008PW2D|1.0|While I absolutely love the women of SATC on HBO, I am a bit disappointed.  2 DVD's only?  I was willing to pay anything until I saw the price.  I own all the DVD's and VHS so I can watch \\"my girls\\" anytime without worry that they do not have a DVD player... but for this edition... I am pissed!  Does the set come with behind the scenes action?  Where is the \\"meat\\" in this boxed set?  I do not think I will be purchasing this set... despite being a very big fan of the show.  This season is one of the most slow seasons ever.  It was almost torture to watch the tragedy unfold.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I don't purchase many cds, but when I bought Simply Red's &quot;Home&quot; last weekend I was so tremendously impressed and pleased with my purchase that I felt it crucial to spread the word about this amazing new album.  Yes, it is random, but it flows well and although there is a lot of new work, some techno beats, this cd is wonderfully nostalgic.  I think of Earth, Wind, and Fire, along with Bob Dylan, along with Marvin Gaye, along with Sting.  This is such a great sound and it is so refreshing to hear new music that doesn't sound like new music.  Buy this cd, a bottle of wine, and just chill out on the sofa for the night with someone special, or at least someone who will aprreciate some very special music.
B000088E6D|5.0|All I ever heard from my dad is that Sinatra 'ruled' - well maybe in his day.     Today it's Bublé all the way for me.<BR>For me, a 17 yr. old to find myself TOTALLY blown away by this music is just so cool. Michael has 'swayed' my thinking. I think it's the first time ever that my dad thought my choice of music was good.<br />I hope he plays in Vancouver or Seattle soon. All my girlfriends and I will be there.
B00005JMFR|1.0|When the first Matrix came out, it more or less revolutionized the action genre.  Old-style gunfights could never again compete with the groundbreaking special effects provided.  The martial arts of an American action movie were finally brought up to par, more or less, with many of Hollywood's Hong Kong counterparts.   The science behind the film of course, was about as goofy as it gets but the story was compelling and the characters likeable.  The acting made up for the pseudo-philosophical preaching of the script.  Characters like Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith proved to be just as engaging as the protagonists of Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus were.  All in all it was an exceptionally satisfying action film.<BR> The second volume in the trilogy did a great injustice to the first by more or less throwing the entire premise away.  The dialogue was trite and clich and the acting was sub-par to say the least.  The film started out with one of the most ridiculous space-fillers of all time.  Something like Club Mtv resurrected for the new millennium.  The only redeeming factors of the film were the spectacular action sequences.  A memorable car chase featuring evaporating gunmen with dreadlocks and a signpost being used like a baseball bat for Agent Smith-balls were visual highlights for the entire year.  The Wachowski's clearly fumbled though.<BR> Along comes Matrix: Revolutions.  This film is loaded with all the negative baggage of the second film with little of its redeeming qualities.  Besides bring back a dance party that should have never made it into the second film, this film somehow deprives Agent Smith of the sinister charm from the other two films although all the best lines are still his.  The mumbo-jumbo that Morpheus continually enunciated has spread like a virus to all the characters.  The tension between Neo and Trinity in the first film fell off a cliff in the second film and gets even worse here.  It's almost as if the Wachowski's have taken screenwritinglessons from George Lucas.  The characters in this film are so unlikable that one really hopes the robots with finish them off, or at least, kill all the humans who have had lines.  The action sequences, while entertaining, fail to live up to, or really approach in any fashion, the first two.  The only exceptional one involves the initial machine entrance into Zion.<BR> Matrix: Revolutions is one of the worst films of the year.  Countless films have at this point knocked off and downright plagiarized the effects of the first Matrix.  Others have even ripped off parts of the plot.  Matrix: Revolutions is as bad as what is at the bottom of those barrels.  The plot doesn't seem to have any direction.  The ideas behind it are muddled.  The final battle between Neo and Smith even ends in a way that has no explanation.  It's a cheap cop out.  Even Monica Bellucci in latex can't save this debacle.  People are going to see this film anyway but I only can hope they throw their money away on a matinee.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|This is not your typical and smarmy, sickly-sweet Christmas album. Rather, with this CD Jethro Tull have managed to capture in both verse and melody the spirit of giving, sharing, and perfunctory overindulgence that ostensibly goes with the Christmas season, contrasted with the melancholy and flat-out destitution that the less-fortunate among us actually experience during this time of year. This interplay of content and style are presented against a backdrop of earthly Pagan solstice symbolism, all of which Jethro Tull have managed to integrate as a kind of ecumenical &quot;Birthday Card at Christmas,&quot; which not incidentally is the title of the introductory track. This combination is daring and bold, if not outright brilliant, and in my estimation they have pulled it off strikingly well. The musicianship, vocals, lyrics, production and overall execution (not to mention outstanding packaging) are commensurate with and at times exceed even Tull's impeccably high standards, showing this to be a band at the top of it's craft. Anderson's vocals, in particular, complete the album by sounding as warmly weathered as the bearded red-suit uncle himself. It's a decidedly Tull exploration of the seasonal space -- an effort that starts strong and improves with subsequent listens. May it continue to play well for you during the holiday season and throughout the year.
B000089RVX|5.0|Though the singer Amy has a good voice, she may not have new sounds in vocals after a while. But beyond what everyone says or likes, Evanescence is worth owning. The music goes from soft to hard with each track, and each tune is different yet catchy. The hit songs aren't great- so if you hate what you hear on the radio forget them- Evanescence is beyond Bring Me To Life and the song Going Under.<BR>Overall, Evanescence put out something different, and though my opinions might change if they put out another album that's bad, they are worth paying for.
B00000INM1|4.0|Mark Knopfler and the bank members always have been the Dream in Poland. I think about looking and feeling the 'Sultans Of Swing' at the live show in Poland. Of course, more people say: I know more better songs of DS but for me this track from this not revelationals album [not best for me] is GREAT. I've a remastered edition and in my opinion the sound is better, and the booklets is more interesting: &quot;&quot;Specially-writteN Sleeve Notes&quot;&quot; it's interesting. This album is more relaxing for me... and I hope for you. Cheers. ToBy
B00008J2DQ|2.0|Buy one Godsmack album. All the Godsmack you need is in your hands now. Get the point? <BR>Every song, every note, every word, every theme, pretty much everything is the same. They aren't a bad band, but this album isn't any more creative then Awake or the Self-Titled one. I just went to see Godsmack in concert, and I could have left after one song and still gotten the concert's heat. So overall, if you like Godsmack, don't expect anything new with this album.
6302516919|5.0|I liked the movie realy much, I watched it about 15 times by now. The Music, the Acting, the Midnight Rampages, everything is just great!<BR>The only part I didn't like was when they trashed the Car, but that pays off later.<BR>A must buy!
B00008H2LB|4.0|I liked this album. But so many people put on that they love the album or that they totally hate it; but you will never know until you listen to all the songs yourself. Before you judge Linkin Park, listen to the album and hear all the songs for yourself. Everyone is different, and their like for music is different too. Linkin Park is a different band.... they don't have the hardcore attitude Rap and Metal usually has. They are their own genre. Wether you hate or love the album, Linkin Park has become well-known and has made music that made you listen.
B000060P79|3.0|Simple Plan is a cute, poppy-punk group who sound like they're having WAY too much fun to be exclaiming that &quot;life is a nighmare&quot; and &quot;god must hate me&quot;. But you can't deny that the tunes are catchy. Even though I usually listen to more hardcore stuff (Nirvana, AFI, The Distillers, Smashing Pumpkins), it's sometimes its nice to get a break and listen to some more pop-ish stuff. Pierre's voice can be slightly whiny at times, but is generally tolerable, and although Simple Plan's songs about girls and tennage drama aren't exactly mature and their material, lyrically and musically, is nothing new, they are still a fairly good band who deserve some cred. I mean...hey...they may be way recycled, but at least they sound like they're having fun doing it.

It truly touches your heart from meeting Dill to supporting Robinson you'll never know what's coming next.  Not only will Harper Lee's words scream at you from the page but they will pull you in until all you want is to read, to find out what happens to these kids and how fast they are thrown into the real world.  No kid wants that.  This book is so moving, you'll want to read it again and again just to get that heart warming feeling. Thanks to Harper Lee for this inspiring novel.

B000002540|4.0|This was a landmark release for several reasons.  It was the first BOC effort to appear in color; simultaneously, it was the first to be live.  As if that wasn't enough, it was also the first time they clocked in a vinyl that ran a decent length.<br />There is serious power in this, the first testament to their live repertoire.  That ambassadorial car on the cover symbolizes their having 'arrived' after three sweaty and tumbling studio albums and what a representation it is.  Lethally fast rock oozes from Roeser's guitar while Lanier swooshes incomprehensibly well on the keys.  The Bouchard brigade keep a thunderous, accurate rhythm-section going and Bloom positively shines on guitar and voice.  <BR> Having said all that, the track selection isn't as great as it could have been.  That it might be a support-tour for 'Secret Treaties' is what you could be forgiven for thinking.  'Tyranny ...' isn't represented as well and 'B.O.C.' is grievously undersung also. There are juicy bonuses on hand ('Maserati GT (I Ain't Got You') but realistically speaking, whoever did the selecting and the sequencing for this needed to have a better think about what might've worked better.  <BR>All in all, you can't lose with is but if you're going to restrict yourself to just one live BOC piece in your collection, don't make it this.
B0000D96NW|5.0|Forget burning red and supercharger those albums sounded like nu-metal mallcore garbage. This is straight forward Classic sounding, this album is probably one of the best heavy metal albums out there.
B00005JMFR|5.0|A lot of movie critics didn't much like The Matrix Revolutions, which supports my belief that a lot of movie critics are idiots. The movie is by no means perfect, but it's very good. All of the Matrix movies compel the audience to think, while at the same time provide some of the best action sequences put on film. All of the things outlined in the first two movies come together. I just finished watching this movie in theaters 2 1/2 hours ago and still have a tension headache from this movie's intense action scenes, respectfully. In my view, the best way to understand the Matrix movies in general is to understand the importance of technology as well as our sense of individuality. It seems thats the reason why the Matrix was set up by the machines so that a human being's individuality could be suppressed via the illusional world established by the machines. Overall, the Matrix films best articulate the human will to survive with the added legendary 'messiah' belief thrown in. I wish the climax could have been a little more dramatic but overall I don't think it detracts from the effectiveness of the film. Run, don't walk, to see it!
B00005JMFR|2.0|Just back from seeing 'The Matrix - Revolutions\\". <BR>Yes, it looks great and it sounds great, but ultimately I was just left with an empty feeling. which was disappointing. After nearly 6-7 hours of screen time I was hoping that the third installment  would bring the storyline to an acceptable conclusion. As it ends now I expect we'll se Matrix 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9 over the coming years. (Depends how much MONEY this one earns). <BR>I noticed a few people saying you had to understand the final film to like it. Could one of these people explain the final film in less than 50 words?
0140067477|5.0|When we were covering Taoism in my World Religions class, I suddenly recalled the Tao of Pooh book my sister-in-law gave me the year I planned to end it all, back in 1995/96.  I read it once, was comforted by it, and forgot it all.  Years later, after reading Taoism, I instantly felt a light bulb flash in my head... &quot;Oh, so that's what it's all about!&quot;  This cute book combines the Taoist philosophy in conjunction with Pooh's interractions with his friends, with Christopher Robin being the kind but serious teacher who tries to teach Pooh about what he represents--Taoism.<br />In contrasting Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, Confucius is described as a sour-faced man, Buddha as one with a bitter expression, but Lao-Tse being the smiling one.  Basically, the laws that govern the heavens are the same one that govern earth and man, and that if we go with the flow, we'll be in harmony.<br />The concepts of wu-wei is also explained.  Wu-wei means &quot;not doing&quot; but of doing nothing against the natural flow.  Here, it's called the Pooh Way, because Pooh has a &quot;mind that merely sees what's in front of it, and follows the nature of things.&quot;  In other words, put the round peg in the round hole, the square peg in the square one.<br />The characters who make up Pooh's friends demonstrate the flaw of knowledge and cleverness, and I was fascinated and sobered by this because their personalities reflect me, and I realize the bad side in knowing too much.<br />Dig this:  Owl, the modern equivalent of a Confusionist, Dessicated Scholar, is described as someone who gains Knowledge for Knowledge's sake, or for the sake of appearing wise.  A bit harsh because that's me to some extent.  Rabbit is described as someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of appearing Clever, and I had to wince, because to my shame, I fully admit that's also me to some extent.  And Eeyore is someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of Complaining.  Given my political stance, yes, me too again.  And as Pooh says in response to Owl having a brain, &quot;I suppose that that's why he never understands anything.&quot;  Maybe that's my problem too.<br />But Pooh, the lucky bear, may not have much of a brain, but he embodies the Simplicity of the Uncarved Block, the Taoist equivalent of John Locke's tabula rasa (blank slate).  Basically, Pooh can't describe the Uncarved Block, he just IS it.  &quot;That's the nature of the Uncarved Block.&quot;<br />And he's got the right idea in not being a Bisy Backson, or (Busy Back Soon), you know, rush-rush-rush.  I wonder why we don't have an American equivalent of a French sidewalk cafe or Chinese teahouse.  Now that I'm getting on, maybe I value the message of &quot;You're important.  Relax and enjoy yourself.&quot;<br />A cute book on the explanations of Taoism, and how maybe simplicity, wisdom (as opposed to knowledge) and contentment is the best way to go.  But it makes me wish that I was a tabula rasa or an Uncarved Block once again.  Oh, just to be, not to know or be clever, but just to be., me too again.

B000055Y0X|4.0|If you have a keen sense of irony and a love of classics then buckle your seat-belts kiddos and get ready for the ride only thoughtful and discerning viewers can truly appreciate. If, on the other hand you totally lack social nuance like I do, and maybe one time, accidentally, used the big fork instead of the small one at the fancy office Christmas party and Jenny from accounting will never let you forget about it no matter how many times you change the cooler water for the department and show her how to use company time to check stock quotes and download gourmet recipes to feed her gifted brood (who by the way would rather have a grilled cheese sandwich) without getting caught, then get down with the veiled slapstick. Either way, DVDs count as members of a culturally sophisticated lexicon, as books did some years ago and if you have this one on your shelf, your sure to impress the coffee-swilling vixen that you picked up at the trendy hot spot with your contrived use of film knowledge.

B00005JLYW|1.0|Generally, I dig cheesecake as much as the next guy.  But what this movie offers in that department is simply not worth it when you consider what you have to put up with to get it.  What you have to put up with is, quite possibly, the most poorly written script that any major Hollywood release has ever had.  Bad movies are one thing and some are even fun in their badness.  This movie skirts around fun and just settles into uncomfortable.  <br />Scenes run together with no connecting elements whatsoever beyond the foolish whims of so-called director McG and whatever chimp wrote the film.  The performances from the actors are as unbelievable as the foolish and poorly choreographed stunts they spend the entire film throwing at us. <br />The Matrix offered moviegoers an asounding array of stunts.  Charlie's Angels, attempting to captilize on that, offers a wide array of ludicrous, unbelievable, unimpressive and cartoonish stunts.  And let's not forget numerous useless celebrity cameos.  And why is Demi Moore in this movie?  Who knows.  My hat goes off to Bill Murray who had the good sense to stay as far from this mess as possible.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I was dissapointed in this sequel to what I thought was perhaps the best sci-fi movie to come out of the 1990's.  The Matrix did for the 1990's what Blade Runner did for the 1980's, 2001 did for the 1960's, Forbidden Planet did for the 1950's, and so on.  It really made you think a lot.<br />While watching The Matrix Reloaded, I felt like I was watching a series of music videos with movie in between them.  The fight scenes were so heavily choreographed that they seemed more like some sort of chaotic, violent sort of ballet.  Music on, fight starts.  Music over, fight over.  Then of course there was that &quot;love scene&quot; in the city of Zion which I won't even go into.<br />My first hint that something was wrong was when Neo was fighting hundreds of Smiths, and I thought that if this was a cartoon I'd soon see them knocked down like bowling balls, and sure enough that's what happened!<br />So, for me the bottom line is that this time the makers of this film chose eye-candy over brain food.  It's entertaining to sit through once, but I didn't spend much time thinking about this movie afterward.  And, unlike The Matrix, I doubt I'll ever want to see this movie again, or buy it on DVD for that matter.
B0000508U6|5.0|I first discovered Coldplay when I heard &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. I loved the album and had to hear more. So when I heard &quot;Parachutes&quot;, it blew me away! I never heard such a perfect album like this one in a long time. I simply adore every track made here. And right now,&quot;Yellow&quot; is my favorite song of all time. This may be strange that I'm giving such praise to such an incredibly soft rock album. But its just that good. A MUST HAVE.
B0000CFW87|5.0|With every new song Josh sings, he proves his phenomenal talent!  Each song is full of emotion and you can hear the care Josh takes in singing each one.  It was also a treat to hear Josh play the piano on &quot;Remember When It Rained.&quot;  Great CD and a perfect follow up to the first album.
B000069AUI|5.0|I usually listen to rap/hip-hop. But when I heard this album one day, I instantly got hooked. My favs have to be &quot;green eyes&quot; and &quot;scientist&quot; cuz they both just sound so damn cool and have beautiful lyrics as well. Every song (Except Sunlight) is just a masterpiece full of originality and soul. But as I listened to their earlier album, &quot;Parachutes&quot;, I found that their first album is even better. &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; may not be as good as their previous one, yet its still great Coldplay. No matter what kind of music you listen to, you will enjoy this album in one level or another. BUY IT!!!
B0000UJL96|5.0|This movie has it all, and was the perfect send-off for the TOS crew. Of course, now with the mess created with the \\"death\\" of Kirk in Generations, this has to be fixed. (See, TNG started messing with things right off the bat. THANKS BERMAN!) But anyway, this contains what I think is the most dramatic line in all of Star Trek. It's just one word, said by our famous Captain James T. Kirk\\" \\"FIRE!!!\\" The emotion and drama in that loaded word sums up everything Kirk is. Get this movie, and enjoy!
B00000I41G|4.0|Great album, a bit startled when it ended....just too soon. Talented bluesy jazz. (I always look for more rythm in an album so thats why only 4 stars.) put the disc in with 4 others and press shuffle cause ya ain't gonna wow anyone by this disc on it's own.  *do buy*
B000007T2Z|5.0|I ran across Godspeed via the film \\"28 Days Later\\" (which I also highly recommend).  The music used in an early scene in this movie was so memorable that I had to hunt it down (I found out it is not on the original soundtrack).  <br />I wouldn't know what to really call this music, as if that really mattered anyway.  To my ear, its extremely (VERY extremely) introspective and (often, but not always) bleak, dark and moody.  These (9? 15?) musicians go everywhere musically: apocalyptic spoken word/poetry, found samples of street preachers, dark ambient soundscapes, a sort of western movie soundtrack, atonal weirdness, classical chamber music (think Kronos Quartet), punk, Velvet Underground-Pink Floyd-Joy Division-70s King Crimson darkness... But this band is original, truly original - there is no real comparison.  I think I'd even go so far to say that this is one of the most unique bands since the Velvet Underground.<br />This album will pull emotions out of you that you never knew you were capable of feeling!<br />GYBE's music tends to build slowly, gradually, inevitably - it reminds me of what Pink Floyd did in the early 70s (when they were good), songs like \\"Echoes,\\" except GYBE succeeds even more so.  The music is not completely pessimistic in tone, though it is certainly bleak...  There is I think a sense of hope, of a real future in their music.  There is some achingly beautiful music here.  Nevertheless, the music can easily put one in the mood for reading Beckett or Cioran.  It is the soundtrack to the inevitable collapse of a civilization, fallen gods... and, for better or for worse, a new beginning.  <br />The album opens with some imagery that was too reminiscent of September 11, 2001, almost prophetic: \\"It went like this: The buildings tumbled in on themselves, mothers clutching babies, picked through the rubble and pulled out their hair.  The skyline was beautiful on fire, all twisted metal stretching upward, everything washed in a thin orange haze...\\"But this was recorded in 1997. <br />Get this album!

There was the calm and crude captain, the idiot pilot, the quiet doctor,the outgoing mechanic, the unoticable hor, the overreacting guy with the guns, the girl in the box, and a couple other characters were easy to connect with. Getting the characters personalities wasn't all that hard either. The show was also action-packed with lots of shooting scenes. Another thing was that this was one of the first space show that WASN'T trying to beat Star Treck. Out of all the space show, this was the only one that wasn't trying to be the next Star Treck. Why FOX canceled it, i'll never know. I think almost everyonewould like this TV series.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|Yes, I did buy the cd without seeing the movie.  But, I have my reasons.  You see, my favorite performer sings two of the songs - Adam Pascal sings both &quot;Heal Me, I'm Heartsick&quot; and &quot;Fight&quot; with the band &quot;No Vacancy&quot;.  I was a little upset that he was given no acknowledgement on the cd for his vocal performances, but then I realized that if anyone has ever heard Adam before, they would know it's him.  I did listen to the rest of the cd, and I found a lot of my favorite classical rock.  Hey, who doesn't love the Doors, right.  Also, the Black Keys piece was awesome as well.  Still, the two songs with &quot;No Vacancy&quot; (to me) are clearly the best... but then again, I'm a little prejudiced, LOL.  If you liked these two songs, you may wish to look at Adam's solo album &quot;Model Prisoner&quot; at [...] or the soundtrack to the Musical Rent.  Sorry about the biased review, I just couldn't help it.
B00006RU5B|2.0|Everybody is praising this band for being one of the best out there.  But my question is why?  If the members of this band were not formerly from very successful bands, I can guarantee you they would not get all of the love they are receiving.  This CD is boring, choppy, and unoriginal.  It is better than a small quantity of its competition, but lacks in interest and creavtity.
0792844882|5.0|Elizabeth Berkley stars as a hooker who wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl...only to find out it's not as glamourous as she anticipated. All I can say is, they certainly saved money on the wardrobe....Elizabeth Berkley spends over 50% of the movie naked.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I can't believe someone wrote Chris Martin sings off key. I spent the first 5 minutes trying to make sure it wasn't dubbed, because the band and singing sound so excellent! Better than probably anyone I've seen live, in being able to reproduce the quality of a studio album. I do so love Cold Play, but usually hate live albums and this cd is incredible. The video is great, and their performance is so exciting. Crank it up and groove!

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Maybe my favorite dream theater cd and that's saying a lot.  First of all, it's a lot more metal than anything they have ever done but it stills stays progressive (don't know what that one dude was talking about saying it wasn't progressive) and the riffs on here are smoking! The bass guitar!  Their best bass ever!  You can actally hear the bass and it's so good that it's worth buying the album just to hear the bass guitar!  Most bass players are useless but John Myung proves that he is one of the best ever on this cd.  <br />This is their most darkest cd too and it comes off extremely well.  As always, the drumming is extremely good and their keyboard player has really improved from their last release.  and james?  well, he's still the same ol james, which means he rules.   <br />I know the words brutal and dream theater usually don't go together in the same sentence but this cd PUMMELS you.  the only breather you get is track 5, which is a short quiet piece and pretty much a waste of time.  the other 6, VERY LONG, tracks are the best, tell you me.  <br />Opening track As I Am is very catchy yet it still avoids being repetitive and the guitar solor towards the closing of the song will blow your mind it's so good.  <br />This Dying Soul seems to be some sort of sequel or something to The Glass Prison (track 1 on the first disk of six degrees) because it has a riff in it that is very close to one in the glass prison and they mention the glass prison.  <br />Honor Thy Father is probably the heaviest and fatest track on here and my favorite other than track 3, which I will get too now.<br />Track 3, Endless Sacrifice, is like track 2 from six degrees on steriods, the best song on this cd if you ask me.  epic epic epic and still extremely fun to listen to.  <br />The last track, In The Name Of God, is the longest track on here and a great way to close the album and finish it off.  The first 30 second are quiet and melodic then at 31 seconds the pain and heaviness startswith a really groovy, thick, heavy riff.  throughout the song, the keyboard sounds like a piano, very cool.<br />The instrumental track, Dream Of Consciousness, is 11 minutes and 16 seconds of pure frickin amazement.  one of the best instrumentals EVER by them or any other band.   <br />I CANNOT explain this cd with words, i cannot recommend it enough.  it's a masterpiece, buy it now.
B0000AI45P|5.0|A recent review here says that this album is 1) \\"not a punk record\\" and 2)\\"overrated.\\"  This only demonstrates the naivete of many of those who consider themselves \\"punks\\"--people who believe that punk is solely about sloppy musicanship and tuneless songs.  \\"Marquee Moon\\" is definitely a punk record, and although it is certainly not archetypal of the popular conception of punk (its excellent musicanship and epic songs bear no resemblance to most 'punk' bands), it is a rare breed--a truly innovative record that has held up remarkably well in 25+ years.  While some of the punk music produced in the 70s and 80s sounds pretty lame now, \\"Marquee Moon\\" stills sounds stellar, with the point-counterpoint melodies and gorgeous jams occupying the same hallowed space as they did in 1978.  Television's eccentric style, built around dueling guitars and odd tunings, was truly innovative even within the revolutionary fissures of the punk movement--The Sex Pistols and The Clash were very much akin to snottier versions of The Stooges, while the Ramones were a surf band playing at hyperspeed.  Television's mastefully innovative magnum opus \\"Marquee Moon\\" is not only a crowning achievement of its day but also a bottomless well of inspiration for future bands, and thus a necessary staple of any rock record collection.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I would highly recommend buying this movie. Just imagine The Matrix with a horror twist. WIth a suprise ending, this movie keeps you away from bathroom breaks. Definately a must see!!!
B000089RVR|5.0|Why Are You Reading This?
B0000CAQ27|5.0|this cd is great i enjoyed
B00008UZPD|5.0|This was an excellent movie. It deserves 5 stars for sure. The action was excellent, the movie was creative and the story was excellent. This by-far was better than the matrix. The main character could ACT, and the action segments were excellent for any film. The concept was pretty original, and the acting was excellent. Unlike the Matrix, this was a trully good movie, and not just perceived as good because of hype. And this clearly couldn't have been a Matrix rip-off because it was in production the same time as the Matrix. I gave this movie 5 stars because it is just so much better and more creative then the Matrix and any other action/sci-fi movie i've seen.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Basically this movie is full of flaws.<br />It's derivative of a half dozen better films.  It kills off some of it's major characters before the ending - and not secondary ones - key ones who we care about.  <br />The premise is overly simplified and highly suspect.  <BR>The fight scenes are so unrealistic that they border on ridiculous.  The formula and story arch are too obvious.<br />I still quite enjoyed it. The movie had a consistency that really felt solid. The main characters are like Plato's cave-dwellers coming in to the light.  Their revelation felt real on a certain level.<br />The film also had a philosophical statement that resonated.  Most movies are not so ambitious, and frequently fail because they don't say anything.  Godzilla and the Time Machine come to mind.  <BR>The Matrix 3 succumbs under it's own weight because whatever it was saying has become too confusing and thus meaningless.  <br />Mr. Wimmer is not a great movie maker, but I enjoy his work.<BR>I hope he gets another project.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I can't believe that this is the first time this movie is available on DVD.  This is the sort of movie that can be watched over and over again.  Tim Burton really does a good job on directing this movie about Ed Wood.  If you have ever seen Plan 9 from Outerspace then you are familar with the \\"worst\\" director of all time.  Johnny Depp is at his finest down to the angora sweater fetish.  Even if you are not familar with Ed Wood, you will find this movie very enjoyable.  What makes this movie even more humourous is the history behind it.  Either way, this is a great edition to any dvd colletion.
6305882592|5.0|In one of THE original cult movies (4 years before ROCKY HORROR &amp; 7 years before BLOODSUCKING FREAKS) Bud Cort plays 20 year old Harold, a young man who has a morbid fascination with death. For leisure he drives his long-suffering mother mad by enacting fake suicides to get attention such as &quot;hanging&quot; himself and &quot;slashing&quot; his throat and wrists, much to the chagrin of Harold's pompous mother who sends him to see a shrink. A true believer in the old &quot;mother knows best&quot; adage, she answers and fills out the questionaire for her son. So its not that surprising when we learn that Harold drives a hearse and for leisure he attends strangers' funerals.<BR>However, one such funeral changes Harold's life forever. Its at one of these gatherings that he first meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79 year old who is not your average crocheting, cookie baking Grandma. For leisure Maude likes to steal cars. And from here their friendship grows, with the eternally optimistic Maude encouraging Harold to embrace life instead of dwelling upon death. Their relationship soon blossoms into an unconventional, but true love; which again meets with mother's disapproval. <BR>Written &amp; Co-Produced by Colin Higgins, HAROLD AND MAUDE was unfairly overlooked on its initial release but over the years gained a strong following; and todays ranks as one of the very best black comedies/love stories ever made. Special highlights for me included Harold's efforts to escape being drafted into the army, and also Harold's hari-kiri &quot;suicide&quot; demonstration for one of the young women his mother has set him up with.<BR>Both leads are excellent, especially Bud Cort; who was/is so convincing in his role that he found himself typecast for life- and some people really believed he was as &quot;out there&quot; as Harold in real life!!  So poor old Bud was given the silver lining before the cloud! Hopefully one day some director will use his talents in the way he deserves. Ruth Gordon is hard to resist as Maude- she's probably the kind of Grandma every kid wishes they had. <BR>Of course, the movie is also famous for the soundtrack by Cat Stevens which complements the film beautifully. If you haven't seen HAROLD AND MAUDE before then I strongly urge you to rent a copy. It's not for all tastes with its inconventional love story and its (often very) black humor; but this is one of those rare films that leaves you feeling alive and exhilarated after watching it and commands repeat viewings. Unless you're a P.C old prat who believes the &quot;suicides&quot; in the movie to be &quot;injurious to the public good&quot;(!!) and the idea of a 20 year old and an 80 year old being in love to be &quot;immoral&quot;. (No prizes for guessing who I'm talking about). Maybe a little icky.<BR>The DVD features aren't great, just a couple of different trailers for the film; but I can't recommend this movie highly enough. Put it on your must-see list. HAROLD AND MAUDE gets my seal of approval (Woop de doo, I hear you say) and despite being more than 30 years old it doesn't appear to have dated at all, and remains relevant today. Watch it and judge for yourself.
B00005UW7V|2.0|I just finished watching &quot;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&quot; for the first time, and, while I usually like to see a movie at least twice before reviewing it, this one is so bad that I don't even know whether I can sit through it again. The story begins in the future (presumably about 100 - 200 years from now) at a time when robots are being made that are so lifelike, it's sometimes hard to tell them apart from real people. A couple loses their son (we are led to believe that he is dead, but this turns out not to be true) and adopts a little boy robot to take his place. The boy robot is programmed to mimic the emotions of a human boy, but it doesn't take long to realize that things aren't working quite as planned. Then, in a total shocker, it turns out that the couple's son isn't dead after all, and he comes home to live with his parents and his robot brother.<br />I don't want to give away the whole story here, so let's just say that the little boy robot ends up, like an electronic Pinocchio, on a quest to become a real boy. The story is dumb, there are plot twists that make no sense at all (staying underwater for 2000 years while praying to the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy is one of them) and the acting performances of the adults are weak. The only consistently good thing about this movie is Haley Joel Osment's performance as the little boy robot. The special effects are good at times, but cheesy at other times.<br />It's a good thing that kid can act, or I would've had to give this a one-star rating.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|After being bored to tears by Metropolis Pt. 2 and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Dream Theater rewards my patience by putting out their best album since Awake.  This album is about straight up prog metal songwriting.  Finally.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This highly anticipated CD is even better than his first.  It is totally addicting with beautiful songs in four different languages ... every one a &quot;goosebumper&quot;!  I love it!
B00005JMFI|5.0|Coming from a judgemental and hyper-critical film critic, five stars is saying a lot.  The whole movie was great from start to finish.  There were no slow parts, and everything seemed to flow.  Not only were there great lines, but there were touching family moments.  Will Ferrell made the movie great- I only wish he wasn't married.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm very impressed with this album. This band clearly has it's own sound, yet the cd is suprisingly versatile. Loved the heavier, more guitar driven tunes. However, I also liked the songs like 'Immortal', which is a quieter, but still intense number. This is a very consistent cd that you can listen to all the way through without having to skip weak pieces. Highly recommended.
B00005JKC3|3.0|&quot;Hulk&quot; was a disappointment.  I hate to say it, but it's true.  This movie had so much potential, but it fell flat from the word go.  The story dragged on for what seemed like a lifetime, and Ang Lee's comic-style editing became annoying after the first few minutes.  The highpoint of the movie is, of course, the Hulk.  If you are blessed with a DVD player, simply skip over the parts that don't include a CGI graphic, and you'll have a good time.  Eric Bana didn't win me over as Bruce Banner, and as much as I enjoy Jennifer Connelly, her Betsy character has the emotion of a stone.  Nick Nolte was also a let-down in this feature.  Sam Elliot was okay, but if you took off his military wear and slapped a cowboy hat on him, you'd think you were watching one of his westerns, which he is so much better in than this creation.<br />The &quot;Hulk&quot; creature was fairly good.  Throughout most of the film, he seems reasonably real-life.  If Ang would've given the CGI monster more screen time, this movie would have been a lot better.  Granted, all he does is smash up things and save a few innocents along the way, but that is so much more interesting than the rest of this story.<br />I'm a big fan of comic book movies, and this is one of my least favorite adaptations.  If Ang Lee would have left out a little more of the &quot;why&quot; Banner ended up as a green crushing machine, and got to the substance of this story, perhaps it would have been a lot better.  Besides, when I think of the Hulk, I think about things getting ripped up and trashed.  This movie, however, spends more time on the woes of child abuse, domestic violence, and genetic testing than our green hero.<br />If you can stay awake through the agonizing dialogue and ever-so-slow pace and actually see CGI Hulk, you may like this movie.  If you're a die-hard Hulk fan, you may like this movie.  But if you don't meet this criteria, please just consider this a rental.
0671027344|5.0|I don't think there was one moment through reading this book were i was not satisfied. After every letter i read, i found myself lying back down and just thinking &quot;wow.&quot; <BR>I read this book for the first time around ten months ago. One of those books that i picked up from the airport and then realising after i had purchased it, &quot;why do i need to read a book in mexico?&quot; But i picked up the book during a flight delay and fell in love. With Charlie. The book made me think about myself, and my place in the world. Not like other books on teenage angst that made me think, &quot;where do I fit into everything?&quot; but the perks of being a wallflower made me think, &quot;where does everything fit in around me?&quot; For that, i was grateful.<br />\\"I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why.\\" <br />I think it was when the writer touched on the song &quot;asleep&quot; by the smiths. Which has always been one of my fabourite songs. And the way that he described it as 'the perfect song, on that perfect drive, on a road to feel infinite.' I was in awe. And i still am. And i yearn for the day where i can drive through a tunnel, with the wind in my hair, listening to a beautiful song, and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and feeling infinite. I can't wait.
B000001FO4|5.0|So much has been said about this album. So many positive things have been said of 'Long Cold Winter'. I don't often find myself agreeing with other peoples music reviews, but with this recording I make an exception. The riffs, the bass lines, the leads, the solos, the fantastic production, the excellent drumming--it's all here. All this in 1988, of all times. At a time when people where losing control of their bodily fluids for the &quot;hot&quot; single &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and the legion of Jovi fanatics. And GNR can keep their 'Appetite For Destruction'. <br />With 'Long Cold Winter', I get the hard rock and I get the ballads. There are actually GOOD lyrics on this record. While I am not a die-hard Cinderella fan, I do believe this very recording to be one of the greatest of its time. One of the greatest albums of the 80's.
B0000CFW87|4.0|A lot has happened in the two years since the release of Josh Groban's eponymous debut album.  \\"Closer\\" shows than in that space of time, Groban has matured vocally and musically.  (He receives a few co-songwriting credits on this album, showing he perhaps has skill in that area as well.)  And at 22, his talent still far exceeds his years.<br />On \\"Closer\\", Groban plumbs the upper and lower limits of his vocal range.  Still pitch-perfect and with superior technique, Groban diversifies his stylistic repertoire and emotional range.  While the spot-on, straightforward delivery of many songs on his debut may have struck some as emotionally flat, Groban affords these songs much more depth.  \\"When You Say You Love Me\\" test the pop waters with lovely results.  \\"Mi Mancherai\\" from the film \\"Il Postino\\" is gorgeously framed by violin arpeggios from another \\"boy wonder\\" of music, Joshua Bell.  The achingly beautiful \\"Remember When It Rained,\\" (co-written by Groban himself) features the multi-talented performer on piano as well as singing.  And another real stunner on this album is the anthemic \\"You Raise Me Up\\" which, like \\"Let Me Fall\\" resonates on many levels.<br />The album spans genres from gospel to pop, and Groban handles each one quite well.  But if Reprise Records wants to continue marketing Groban as a \\"classical crossover\\" artist, perhaps they should let him do some classical or operatic songs.  The closest we get to that is \\"Caruso\\", which shows Groban has more than the chops needed to do opera justice. <br />The only misstep I can see is Groban's cover of \\"Hymne a l'amour,\\" first made famous by the incomparable Edith Piaf.  To be sure, Groban's version is quite beautiful and he adds flourishes and touches of his own, but he does not quite provide the emotional resonance required of this bittersweet song.  It makes you think that at 22, he is perhaps too young for such a song.  Perhaps in 10 or 15 years...<br />The only reason I gave the CD four stars instead of five is because I don't think it shows all of what Groban can do.  That's not necessarily bad news, because it means we still have years to enjoy his ever-improving voice.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok, I'll be honest...after first listening to this album, I wasn't extremely impressed.  However, the more I listened to it, the more I realized that as much as I liked &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, it really wasn't one of the best offerings.  John Mayer really pieced together a fantastic all-around album, and I think it's one of the best of the new millenium so far.  His lyrics are emotional and clever, and each song feels as if he's telling you a personal story.  Musically, Mayer dabbles in a mixture of styles, ranging from contemporary Jazz to folk.  If you enjoyed &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and/or &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot;, I'd highly recommend picking up this CD...you won't be disappointed.
B000069CWE|5.0|Love this cd. The remixes aren't so overbearing that the songs are so completely unrecognizeable from the original versions.  In fact, they give some pieces a certain edge that made me like them even more. Excellent set.
B00005JM02|4.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is an enjoyable film to watch.  With characters like &quot;Bruce&quot; and &quot;Dory,&quot; this story is sure to hold the attention of any young child.  My two and one-half year old loves it, and not a day goes by when she wants to watch the &quot;fish&quot; show.<br />Like other Pixar movies, this story features great animation, although I noticed a couple of frames in the DVD looked rather &quot;digitized&quot; compared to others.  The story isn't too violent, is geared towards younger audiences and has a few laughs for the adults.<br />I didn't enjoy this movie as much as &quot;Toy Story&quot; or &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; but it is worth a look for the older crowd.  I did laugh at a lot of the silly humor in this flick, but overall this movie seems to be geared toward the 2-8 year range more than any other Pixar movie.<br />I did enjoy the DVD extra &quot;Knick Knack.&quot;  Other features included virtual aquariums and games for the younger lot.<br />In closing, get this movie for the young ones.  Its great for them, but it's only okay for the older kids.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Let me start by saying I have every DT album and bootleg,and have seen them live numerous times.Most of the time it takes a few listens of the album to gauge it.After 20 or so listens(It's so good I can't stop listening)I've decided that this is their best work to date.Being a huge metal fan, I must say this is the album I've been waiting for since &quot;AWAKE&quot;.This album has an in your face,take no prisoners vibe to it.From beginning to end it is a non stop roller coaster of brutal riffs,insane drums,keys and solos.The only breather here is the song &quot;Vacant&quot;which is a slow melodic track.There is no weak point on this album.So,if you like the metal side of DT most of you will love this.If not,don't rip them for being too heavy because it was DT's intent to produce a classic metal album,and that they have done,brilliantly.<BR>                   &quot;Don't Cross The Crooked Step&quot;
B000002INR|1.0|If you can say flash-in-the-pan more than once without stuttering, this music is not for you.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay's debut album, is a perfect example of why it's more important to be good than to be original. Firmly rooted in the mainstream, and following a well-trodden path, Coldplay have ascended to become one of the biggest rock n roll bands on the planet. And one listen to `Parachutes' is enough to understand why: it is a beautifully melodic, wistful record that occasionally borders on the sublime. <br />Chris Martin's vocals, at times rich and resonant, at others, tremulous and fragile,  are the main reason why Coldplay have risen above other bands of their ilk (Travis, Doves etc.). His is an instantly recognisable voice - an essential factor if a band is headed for the stadium (think Bono, think Michael Stipe, think Thom Yorke). The other factor that helps is to have a bucketful of good tunes, and that Coldplay also possess. `Don't Panic', `Spies', `Sparks' and `Trouble' are all classis, but it was the anthemic `Yellow' (\\"Look at the stars, see how they shine for you\\") that truly captured mass-market adulation. <br />OK, so `Parachutes' isn't breaking any boundaries with its acoustic guitar/piano led sound, backed up by electric guitar, bass and drums. But in truth I'd rather be listening to Coldplay than Radiohead at the moment, no matter how genre-defying the Oxford quintet's last three albums have been. Great if you can pull off both tricks at once, but not too many have managed that since `OK Computer'. In the meantime give me the hearfelt, yet derivative beauty of Coldplay and let's hope that messrs Yorke and co recapture former glories soon.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Again, Sarah has released yet another brilliant album.  As always, it stays in my cd player.  I'll need to buy a 2nd cd from being worn.  She has reinvented herself, but not the style of her music.  Same ol' style, with a fresh new look.  All her albums seem to tell such an exciting story that you really need to find out for yourself, but this one has made it to the 'Top of my List'.  If this is your first, or even second Sarah album, I encourage that you go back to the celtic sounds of 'Touch' &amp; 'Solace'.  All of these songs are brilliantly written and still find a way in my heart.  A must buy and the perfect gift for the music lover in us all.
B0000057C5|5.0|Impressive. Want it categorized? Yea right. It's hard rockin. It's melodic. It's orchestral. I can't understand a word of it. It's really good.
B000002INR|4.0|If you're like me, you grew up in the late 80's/early 90's and wanted to be in a band like Skid Row, Whitesnake or Def Leppard.  At that time, these and other hair/glam/hard rock bands could do no wrong.  From their wild hair to their sonic screams, you loved it all.<br />&quot;Skid Row&quot; is one of those albums that embodies that time of my life.  From &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot; to &quot;I Remember You,&quot; the simple lyrics talked to every teenager growing at that time.  There isn't anything great about any of the songs here, but they were the world to a lot of people back in '89.  &quot;18 and Life&quot; is on the Classic Rock stations(as it should be) and I still know all the lyrics.  You probably do too.  These songs remind me of a fun time in life, when anything was possible.<br />Remember those times when you listen to this album.  It's a time that seems long gone.
B00005UK1F|3.0|Why? This CD is simply too long. Light of Day... starts off brilliantly, it soon becomes apparent that after the first 20 minutes or so that there is not much to offer. Maybe the song should have ended at 17 minutes. They could have taken a few other catchy riffs and written some good tracks. After one sitting it is unlikely that I will ever listen to this CD straight through again. Let's leave the epic catagory for the likes of Pink Floyd, Yes or King Crimson.<BR>Light of Day is my first Green Carnation CD. I can see that they do possess musical talent, just not for 60 minute tracks. I look forward to hearing another work by them.
B000060MY6|4.0|Betty is an annoyingly perky Hollywood hopeful. Rita is an amnesiac who crawls out of a limo involved in an accident - narrowly avoiding being murdered by its driver. The two meet when Rita sneaks into Betty's aunt's house and then fall in love.  With Betty and Rita turning into detectives in the Nancy-Drew mold, they uncover what may be clues to Rita's true identity. Betty balances her amateur detective work, new love life and her plans to star in a break-out role in the film, \\"The Sylvia North Story\\".  Meanwhile, a sinister cabal intimidates Adam Kesher, the film's luckless and spineless director into casting a starlet named Camilla for Betty's role. As Betty, who appears more blonde than Sandra Dee, feels her love for Rita deepen, she also gets closer to the truth about her amnesiac lover.  We learn a thing or two as well - in seemingly unconnected scenes showing the director's shadowy masters; a hitman who kills seemingly out of compulsion; a chillingly glib cowboy who may offer the director a way out; two guys shmoozing about nightmares in a restaurant; a monster hiding behind a parking lot; and a blue box....<br />And then, it begins to go awry, with the illusions giving way to an entirely different existence for our characters. The scenes seem more dream like and illogical, but Lynch gives us more clues. And most importantly, the characters seem to change identities completely. The exotic yet meek Rita is now the much-desired Camilla, a Hollywood superstar who can live without Betty (or Diane). The much-desired Betty becomes the blowsy Diane, a one-time Hollywood hopeful whose dream ended when she lost the lead in \\"The Sylvia North Story\\" to Camilla. Although still dream-like, the latter part of the film is so bleak and dispiriting that we're supposed to think it a dream more routed in reality than the one the movie began with - with Betty's hopes and dreams becoming Diane's unachievable desires. Now, Camilla is Diane's former lover - an affair that Diane isincapable of maintaining even in her imagination (even the dream Camilla dumps Diane).  To underscore Diane's shame, Lynch reunites her with Camilla at dinner party at Adam Kesher's house where he and Camilla are about to announce their engagement).  The newer Kesher is stronger and more resilient the Kesher of Betty's world - even though they both dumped Betty/Diane for \\"The Sylvia North\\" story.  Diane's home (and her life) is an empty husk - she lives alone and never seems to leave, except when she brings a wad of cash and Camilla's picture to that hitman. Day becomes night, shrouding her in shadow as she sits listlessly on her couch, unable to even dream of an idealized version of her hopes.  Between the dreams of hope that open this flick and the nightmares of memories that won't die in the latter half, the characters seem menaced by a blue box. (IMNSHO, the box symbolizes TV, a wasteland for those who couldn't match their dreams for movie stardom - the big plot and character shift occurs when Rita opens the box, and is sucked inside; Because Lynch makes MD an obvious elegy to a lost Hollywood, TV becomes an obvious avatar of its demise and its character's pain). <br />Though cryptic, \\"Mulholland\\" is not quite incomprehensible - it's more of a puzzle, and you and your friends can probably come up with dozens of your own spins on Lynch's loopy twists (and you should bring along a friend - loneliness becomes very palpable here).  \\"Mulholland\\" originally began as a TV mini-series, eventually morphing into a more ambitious project for TV.  It's unclear how much of the film's \\"bicameral\\" structure (the idea of splitting the plot into a dream and the \\"real life\\" that created it) originated before \\"Mulholland\\" made the leap to the big screen. Despite the film's consistently cryptic and creepy atmosphere, Lynch develops an emotional coherence that keeps you tied to the screen. Lynch brilliantly pulls this off at the dinner-party scene in which Kesher's family and friends hear of Diane's less-than-spectacular Hollywood adventures, and we learn of Diane's seemingly bottomless reservoir of pity (we see how unreachable Camilla has become to her, and this is also when we learn that it was Camilla who beat Diane to stardom). Lynch has managed to bring some of the pathos of &quot;The Straight Story&quot; to his trademark world of nightmares, cigarettes, mysterious strangers and all-nite-diners.

What's the point? Listening to people swear, and cuss over some lame beat? I won't pay good money to hear some guy curse and rap...and you won't either, if you're smart.<BR>¤<BR>Will this nonsense ever end?
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was pretty impressed with this cd. I don't normally like the genre, but bottom line is that the girl has a fantastic voice. Best songs on the cd are the ones where she is just belting it out, 'cause we know that she can pull it off. I think this girl's got a solid future if she'd depend more on her voice talents then on her ass.
B0000CABBW|4.0|This is a gem of a movie. It explores some similar themes to &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; (girl power, pursuit of dreams, clash of old and new culture, generation gap), but there is more here and the film is much more thought provoking. The characters are well drawn and finely acted by a largely Maori cast. Keisha Castle-Hughes is particularly striking in the lead role, giving a remarkable first performance. The film is beautifully shot on location using unobtrusive and understated special effects. Highly recommended.
B0000C1HLF|4.0|Bigger, louder, more preposterous than the first movie, yet it slips in and out of your head about as easily.  In this episode (movie, I meant movie!!) the angels must recover two rings upon which are encoded the names of thousands of innocent people currently in the Witness Protection Program. Should both rings fall into the wriong hands (the same hands - the code requires both rings) the lives of innocents will fall to the whims of the evil crime lords who put then away.  One of these dark figures is an Irish enforcer with a link to the past of one of the angels.  But an even darker force is at work pulling the strings...<br />...which is as good an excuse as any to craft a film that alternates between stylized action sequences (with the angels fighting in mid-air, flying off buildings, speeding cars or helicopters) with countless visual gags (the Olsen twins as future Angels; the Angels as nuns; Cameron Diaz as a teenager, complete with nightbrace!; Bernie Mac as the new Bosley)  and TV in-jokes (Starsky and Hutch's car; Mr. Rourke's car from \\"Fantasy Island\\"; the steel-welders from \\"Flashdance\\") and Hollywood cameos (Bruce Willis looking older than he can; Carrie Fisher as Mother Superior; Bela Karolyi as Lucy Liu's coach).  This is the sort of nonsensical Hollywood action epic that we thought only existed as jokes on sitcoms.  It's a lot of preposterous fun, not dampened for those who caught the first movie.  If the flick is less-then-perfect, we can blame Demi Moore as a former Angel now working for herself, a performance that is conspicuously bloodless in an otherwise pumping flick.  Crispin Glover is back (which kind of makes you wonder what exactly happened at the end of the last movie) but not as much psychotic fun as in the first movie.  The flick has John Cleese as Lucy Liu's father who somehow gets the idea that his daughter is some kind of high-priced call-girl (a running joke that gets tired fast) while Shia LeBouf (\\"Holes\\") rounds out the cast as a member of witness protection who gets taken in by the angels, but is otherwise wasted.  Though little more than an extended music video, &quot;Angels&quot; has a message for those who must have one: the Angels never use guns!  If you've got your friends (and some Kevlar), you're more powerful than a horde of gun wielding psychotics.  With its visual gags, this is definitely the flick to get in widescreen.
6305784078|5.0|This is the cutest movie. This movie is mainly aimed at young cat-lovers, but this classic has been my favourite since the age of six. The movie's graphics are beautiful and suit Paris, France--where the movie takes place.  <br />This story is about a family of cats, which are living with madame, an old lady who takes care of them very well, almost like a human. They are sort of like aristocrats, only cats (now you know how the movie recieved its name). The family of cats is made up of Dutchess, the beautiful mother--and her kittens, paino-player Berlioz, Alley-cat Toulouse, and concieted Marie. <br />However, Edgar, the mean and nasty man that lives with madame, wants  takes the kittens away, as madame said that her cats always come first. Madame is very worried, and, she desperately wants her cats to come home. The main part of the story is the cats trying to get home. <br />Along the way, they meet O'malley the alley cat, who bonds with Dutchess and her kittens. He falls in love with Dutchess, and tries to help them come back home.<br />They have a long journey back, they almost get run over by a train, O'malley goes down a river and gets &quot;smimming lessons,&quot; Dutchess meets with twin geese, and they play instruments with Scat Cat and his gang (which are O'malleys' old friends).<br />When the cats finally go home, O'malley leaves, as he doesn't belong there. Edgar is angry and wants to send the cats to Timbuktu. O'malley helps them once he can get Scat Cat and his gang to help. When they get Edgar slammed into the package, they send HIM to Timbuktu. <br />The ending to this story is very nice, as madame decides to take O'malley in. =)<br />That's it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|As many loyal fans of the band know, this album is a bit different than what we have been used to hearing from the 5 geniuses that call themselves Dream Theater. However, that doesn't mean that it's a weak album by ANY means - in my opinion, it's one of Dream Theater's most diverse and meaningful albums. The lyrics to all the songs are (for the most part) personal, and while the writing IS a small step below DT's past efforts it is by no means bad. A much heavier tone prevails throughout, solidifying the argument that Dream Theater is definitely a progressive METAL band. Train Of Thought takes in-your-face, rocked-out metal and, well...DreamTheaterizes it. The result is an amazing album, with every track being more or less a standout. I highly recommend this album to EVERYONE - whether you enjoy Dream Theater or just enjoy plain old heavy music, this is the stuff for you. The guys have amazed me again!
B000059HAI|3.0|The film has real Japanese actors directed by a Japanese moderate director. In this regard the Japanese scenes are much authentic than the recent \\"Pearl Harbor\\" with Japanese American actors. Akira Kurosawa started shooting his scenes with different actors in Japan but soon resigned. None of his shots were used in the film.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I love this concert because it show how talented Britney is and she can sing and it's full of energy like you wouldn't believe. The outfits are so pretty. I love it from start to finish you will just have to see it for yourself.

B00005JMFR|5.0|come on you guys, this movie was great.I cant imagine why anyone woudnt like this one compared to the others.<BR>             things i liked:<BR>           AMAZING visual effects.i was totally blown away.<BR>           great, great, machine battle.that alone<BR>           was worth my 7.50.<BR>      the battle with smith was better than i could have        <BR>      imagined.some would say two people flying through the air at incredible speeds is fake and stupid,but i loved it.<BR>                and now for the bad things:<BR> too much talking and not quite enough action.what i could say though is that they did make up for that during the machine and smith battles.what also dissapointed me was revolutions almost complete lack of martial arts.the kung fu was kept to a bare minimum. and what the hell happened to the oracle? i think it was half explained at some point but i never fully grasped that.oh!i just realized something else. there was no bullet time at all. anyway,I saw revolution on sunday and when trinity died,the whole audience laughed.and during that scene i realized that neo and trinity have no chemistry together whatsoever. it sounds like i hated this movie but im just pointing out some things they could have changed.this might sound odd but i thought there was too much backround chorus and no rock music.they also left the trainman with not enough explanation or action. one more thing i did like was the little girl.she was cute and had a suprisingly large part in this film.well,hopefully ill see this in imax,and then ill see it again, and then its off to see return of the king!no honestly, i loved this movie. if you see three movies this winter, see matrix revolutions, matrix revolutions,and return of the king.and if you still want to go to the movies,see matrix revolutions again.
B000002J0N|4.0|My first impressions of this album was that it was indeed slick; without a doubt a good representation of mid seventies Calfornia &quot;Soft Rock&quot; (ie &quot;Rumours&quot;; &quot;Hotel California&quot;, etc...) and that it had little in common with either their first album or &quot;Deja Vu&quot; (of course, I always felt Neil Young was the odd man out; I prefer his stuff with Crazy Horse.) The songs are good -to their credit, as messed up on drugs as these guys were, they can write- and the harmonies are exquisite as always. My problem with CSN (as with most &quot;supergroups&quot;) is the lack of unity: this is the work of three individuals with a seemingly common goal. You can tell they left the sixties behind with this album; there is no hippy-dippy &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; to be found here. Stills writes about (broken) relationships; Nash writes about anything and everything (with varied degrees of coherence ie &quot;Cathedral&quot;, &quot;Just A Song Before I Go&quot;) and Crosby writes about himself (&quot;I'm the world's most opinionated man!&quot;) As for the music, coming from anyone else, I'd say &quot;Way overproduced!!!&quot; but overproduction was a California Rock prerequisite. The music is layered in CSN's trademark acoustic guitars and keyboards. Lots of percussion. All told, I prefer &quot;CSN&quot; to &quot;Deja Vu&quot;...and having seen the album on CD, LP and Cassette, there appears to be more than one available cover (different shots of them on the boat)!
B0000DBJDM|2.0|Before I begin let me tell you Mr Director, that I am a total Floyd Head, and have been most of my life, and I am NOT a stoner who lives inside on a beanbag. <br />The emminent release of Live At Pompeii has been a hilite of my year so far, and since I ordered it I have been hanging around the mailbox like a moth to a candle. But I have to tell you, I am VERY disappointed with your product.<br />So this is the 'Directors Cut'...well Mr Director...you've had a shocker. Why oh why could'nt you have just left it as it was? The original version that i had on VHS was Perfect! But no, you had to go and throw a load of irrelivant shots of trains coming into stations and contemporary Italian Architechture into the mix, to what...make it better? Seriously Mr Maben, there was a time when you were a visionary, I mean to shoot a band like Pink Floyd in an empty Amphitheatre in Pompeii is genius, and the original Film was incredible, a real time capsule of a band at the peak of thier powers. Then to add in at a later date some footage of Them recording Dark Side Of The Moon along with a few crazed interviews and call it a 'Extended Version' was great! I mean, like you say, in the right place at the right time! But really, Mr Maben, that should have been it, you should have released the thing on DVD and been clear of it, for our sake.<br />The original film opens with a beautifully paced, log zoom of the band accompanied to the sweet sound of 'Echoes', lovely stuff, beautiful. So I have to ask you Mr French Director, what makes you think that by putting footage of a rocket ship flying through space towards earth over the top of the lovely zoom ENHANCES the film? What were you on? OK, you get the point, I'm deeply, deeply disappointed. As the Director of Live At Pompeii, you have a responsibility to us, the public, to do the best job you can to enlighten us with your film, but you have been selfish in that you have lost sight of what it was that you made all those years ago. LiveAt Pompeii is a Historical Piece of music history, and is something that SHOULD NOT be modernised to suit your wavering career. To those of us that love the Floyd, it goes beyond just the music. I cant speak for others, but for me, it's part of my heritage and who I am, and you, my friend, have desecrated that.<br />But there is hope.<br />I hereby say to you now Mr Adrian Maben, you can redeem yourself. Here's what you do. Re-release the concert WITHOUT  all your fancy irrelivant, out of context 'wizardry' and let us have, on DVD, the masterpiece that you once made, the time piece of a band overflowing with creative and exciting power. <br />Disappointing Mr Maben, very disappointing.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has scored again with another collections of songs that just move you.  That is how you know a cd is great and not average when you are able to feel the emotion of the song, not the work behind it.  Josh has certainly been given and amazing gift and I am sure he will be considered one of the all time great when his career is compared to the other singers of his generation.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have not even listen to all the cd. Ive only listen to 2 tracks in their entirety(excluding the single &quot;As I am&quot;)and i must say that Dream Theater will leave a lasting impression in the hearts of anyone who truely appreciates music. Through the transitions of 20th century music..they, like a few groups out there, will be the voice of the truely learned and impassioned music of the 20th century and beyond. To digress a bit, i noticed that bands like Evanescence already have string quartets playing their songs. Likely, a cashing-in business using precious classical chops(or hardly any) for lame-* songs. Of course, if Dream Theater is popular amoungst universities and junior-colleges, why doesnt anyone come out with a classical tribute? Exactly. And dont tell me that its because they are not that popular!!! I will go as far to say that they are the Rush of our time, and defintely a hell of alot more.  So sue me, Just listen to vacant, and then Stream of Conciousness. On first listen, it utterly brought me to tears.
B000002J0P|5.0|Along with &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; by The Rolling Stones and &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; by The Band, &quot;Crosby, Stills And Nash&quot; changed my life and had tons of influence on me as a musician. Without a doubt, if our lives were a movie, &quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes&quot; would have to be on my soundtrack. If memory serves, I first heard this album and met my girlfriend within two days of one another, hence the signifigance. <BR>I've always been a sucker for lots of acoustic guitars and vocal harmonies...these guys excel at it. I can't even come close; I sound funny trying to sing along with the record. The music may not really rock out, per se, might be too mellow for some tastes, but so what? The majority of these songs are classics; on first listen, I kept saying, &quot;Hey! I know this song!&quot; (Seven out of ten.) About my least favourite on the LP is &quot;Lady Of The Island&quot;, but to me, Nash has a tendency to be overly sappy and sentimental. It must have been a tough album to record, considering most of the music is Stills with a drummer (legend has it they locked themselves in the studio for five days with a ton of cocaine and recorded the whole thing that way...maybe so, but it doesn't sound schwacked out.) What can I say? Considering I fly the hippie flag with the best of them, the sentiments of these songs naturally appeal to me, but for the most part, this album could just as easily come out in 1999 as 1969. My definition of a &quot;perfect album&quot; is one where every song is good. &quot;Crosby, Stills And Nash&quot; definitely fits the bill.
B00008LDPU|2.0|Pretty disappointing...of the nine stories, only one, the story of the &quot;rise of the machines&quot; (oh wait, isn't that another movie?) is even halfway interesting.  Great idea, poor execution.
0393051587|5.0|Michael Patrick Hearn wrote the first Annotated Christmas Carol back in 1976. He is also the author of many other books, including The Annotated Wizard of Oz and The Annotated Huckleberry Finn. Both of those had been published about twenty-five years ago and have recently been revised. Now it is A Christmas Carol's turn for a revised edition.<br />The first thing I noticed was the wealth of new material. The old introduction was 51 pages long. The new introduction is 100.<br />Hearn found lots of material in the intervening 27 years that make for a larger book. He benefited tremendously from the publication of the Oxford University Press edition of Dickens's letters. He uncovered many reviews and notices of the book in 1843 and 1844 and has included much of what he found in the introduction. He found information that had been obscured by time. For example, he found that the very first British editions arrived in Boston at 4:15 P.M. on Sunday, January 21st, and were pirated by Harper and Brothers within a few days. The New York True Sun was soon pirating the pirates by serializing the story on the front page of the daily paper by January 29th.<br />As one would expect, the revised edition has many more annotations accompanying the text, than the original edition. For example, the original book had 80 notes in Stave One whereas the 2003 edition has 110. Some of the new notes alone are worth purchasing the second edition, even if you already own the first. His notes on Joe, the old gray-haired rascal who deals with the laundress and charwoman are an essay unto themselves.<br />But the most significant addition is the appendix, which consists of the Public Reading version of A Christmas Carol, and an introduction that covers much of Dickens's involvement with the theatre. The annotations for this section are mostly concerned with the prompt copy and audience members' remembrances of how Dickens performed the reading. Hearn was able to visit the British Library where he consulted the unpublished manuscripts of the 1844 staged versions of A Christmas Carol. They were full of all sorts of tidbits of information that he passes on to us.<br />The new edition also has many more illustrations and photographs, including a stereoscopic picture of Dickens that I never knew existed, that make this volume one to treasure for many Christmases yet to come.he consulted the unpublished manuscripts of the 1844 staged versions of A Christmas Carol.

0060930187|5.0|While reading something, somewhere, I saw this book mentioned, and I ordered it from the library.  Normally I have a list of books waiting to be read, but for some reason I bypassed them and read this book.<br />Wow!  An incredible read!  It was so well written, so real.  I kept saying, &quot;but she is so sane!&quot; and then everything turned, like the weather sometimes does...  I recommend it highly!
0385504209|5.0|I enjoyed this novel because the underlying storyline is intellectually fascinating. The story discusses the development over time of various religious, historical and cultural theories and their significance as to world history and society today.  These deeply meaningful historical backdrop is ingeniuosly woven into an entertaining, compelling story worth buying, reading and finishing. The characters are interesting and diverse.  You continue to guess at the villian(s), so to speak.  Good luck.<br />I would have given it 4 1/2 stars not five though because the ending could have had a real bang. It didn't as far as I was concerned.  And of course you can't help but see the book as a movie; I learded that the rights have been purchased with an opening date of early 2005, I believe.<br />Therefore, as a result of the book I intend to look further into the book's backdrop, so to speak.  But as for the book and its author, I will be waiting to read Dan Brown's next novel and in the meantime will start on the one(s) before this one.<br />I have strongly recommended it to my friends for the reasons stated above.<br />Donna Goldman
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Dream Theater offers their latest release of first draft songs in full cd packaging. There is definitely some decent material on here, it just gets lost in all the noise. None of these songs needed to be this long; most of them wander aimlessly. The lyrics are definitely weak, with no contributions from the master John Myung (WHY NOT?!). All in all, DT continues to diverge from their former greatness. It truly is a shame. Check out works from Jim Matheos, Kevin Moore or Steven Wilson for some truly great music.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|After having listented to the entire album multiple times, I've been able to look past the hype, and judge it as another DT album.  <br />Here we see DT at their heaviest.  I can understand that the progressive fans might be a bit dissapointed due to the fact that most of this album is pure metal.  However, being a big 80's Metallica fan, this album is a breath of fresh air for me.  With a total of 7 songs in 70 minutes, this CD is very epic.  Some might say that the songs would get boring... but I don't find any of the songs seemining boring or too long.  All of them are interesting.<br />This is a just another masterpiece from an excellent band.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants some good metal, without the nu-metal crap of today.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|When you think of Christmas music played by a rock group, you think...YUCK!  But not when its played by Jethro Tull!  Jethro Tull is one of the best Classic Rock artists of all time.  And I'll tell you, when I first saw this Christmas CD on Amazon I thought to myself, this is going to be dissapointing but somone in my head told me to go ahead and just buy it.  So I went ahead and purchased it and boy, let me just saw that all Jethro Tull fans, no, all Classic Rock fans should purchase this CD.  Every song on the CD is a smash hit!  There is hard to pick just one song as the best.  I was so happy to see Bouree on there.  That has to be one of my favorite Jethro Tull songs of all time.  GREAT GREAT piece written by J.S. Bach.  I have had the oportunity to see Jethro Tull in concert about two summers ago on the Living With the Past Tour and let me just say, AMAZING!  It was so good, I went out and purchased the DVD.  All Jethro Tull Fans should own the Living With the Past DVD!  Great Stuff!  Best song they did on the tour was a middle eastern piece intitled The Water Carrier.  Well, Saturday I will be seeing Ian Anderson on his Rubbing Elbows Tour and I am sure he will put on a great show!
B000002IAZ|4.0|This review is mainly in response to the reviewer who wrote anything by Buffalo Springfield is &quot;hugely more enjoyable than anything by the Byrds.&quot;  In 60s parlance, NO WAY.  That's not to say that Springfield didn't record some excellent songs-- they certainly did, as this collection demonstrates. However, for a &quot;Best Of&quot; collection, &quot;Retrospective&quot; is suprisingly uneven. It seems Buffalo Springfield had two great singer-songwriters, Steven Stills and Neil Young, which is usually more than enough for any great band.  Trouble is, they also had and a couple of merely adequate (or even subpar) ones (Rich Furay predominantly) whose work is equally well represented.  For every gem like &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; or &quot;Bluebird,&quot; there is a lump of coal like &quot;Sit Down, I Think I Love You&quot; or &quot;Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing,&quot; which would not make the cut on a regular Byrds album, let alone a &quot;Greatest Hits.&quot; The recording quality is likewise uneven, far from the impeccable production found on the first six Byrds albums.  In one area only does Springfield outshine the Byrds-- chops, and that is almost exclusively due to Stills' sterling musicianship on lead guitar (the Byrds did not get an equivalent lead guitarist in their lineup until Clarence White joined, and by then their days of greatness as an album band were behind them). Another complaint is that the recoding levels on the songs represented here are all over the map, leading to much unecessary jockeying with the volume controls on your stereo.  To summarize, buy this collection for the classic Stills / Young numbers &quot;For What It's Worth,&quot; &quot;Mr. Soul,&quot; &quot;Bluebird,&quot; &quot;I Am A Child,&quot; and &quot;Rock And Roll Woman.&quot; The rest you can safely skip over. For a true &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection, in which EVERY SONG is a blockbuster, buy &quot;The Byrds Greatest Hits (Vol. 1).&quot;
B000002E5J|5.0|I bought this album along with \\"Dnde Estn Los Ladrones?\\" after buying \\"Laundry Service.\\" I loved \\"Ladrones,\\" but wasn't too hot on \\"Pies.\\" After a couple listens, though, I really came to love it. Just because it's a completely different sound than all of her other albums doesn't mean it's the 'flop album,' it's really probably closer to her true style!    It's a largely acoustic album, but it's done excellently in a non-boring way. \\"Un Poco de Amor\\" has a slight Reggae feel to it, with a catchy beat. \\"Te Espero Sentada\\" is a wonderful treat, that goes a musical direction I never expected. The verses and the chorus sound so different, but blend so well. \\"Se Quiere, Se Mata\\" is a story about the ills of lust and abortion.    I am every day more impressed with this album and I never regret that I bought it.

B00001MXXH|4.0|There are certain films that become timeless classics. Hughes put out two of them in the eightees and this is one of them. (The other being Sixteen Candles). I hope Amazon doesn't take offense, but I bought this at a department store over the weekend. A young bespectacled cashier, who couldn't have been a day over 16, remarked that Ferris was his all time favorite movie.  Yes, your kids probably won't like this movie, but your teenagers will.....and you will too. <br />There is just one Special Feature on this film and it is the director's commentary. At times, Hughes delivers some interesting history behind his directorial decisions, but at other times he merely narrates the plot. Too bad the folks at Paramount didn't add a cast member to the commentary. Even without the cast member, fans of Ferris will still enjoy the story behind Cameron's fake voice.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I pretty much had my own idea of how this movie was going to be when I finished watching 'The Matrix: Reloaded' this past Spring. 'Reloaded' was somewhat of a disappointment for me, but it was neccessary. Since May I had it stuck in my head that 'Reloaded' was meant to bridge the gap between the first movie and the last movie, and that is was. Just as the first was a perfect, mysterious and fantasic beginning, 'Revolutions' is a no-holds barred, rollercoaster of action and emotion that closes out the trilogy with a bang. There is an entire action sequence that involves the machines penetrating Zion (the last living city, for those of you not in the know) where we are taken away from the main characters for about 40 minutes -- and you don't even notice! It is so easy to be engrossed in the action in this movie. All I ever heard was the hype about that darn freeway chase in 'Reloaded' that didn't seem to amount to anything. The action sequences in this movie are completely wild and over-the-top. And if action isn't what you are looking for, everything else is still here. The love story between Neo and Trinity is at it's strongest by this point, and of course with the way things work out, it would have to be. This movie also isn't as confusing as some would have you believe. As someone who hasn't submerged himself in all of the 'Matrix' multimedia that are said to be vital (video-games, cartoons, books, magazines, underwear, shot-glasses, vitamins...maybe I'm getting caried away), I walked away from this movie with a perfect understanding of the series as a whole and overall, I loved every minute of this movie. As said before, 'Reloaded' may have been a bore, but it made this movie possible. Don't let that disappointment (I know a lot of people were) damper your mood for seeing this movie. 'Revolutions' is a cinematic milestone. A must-see for anyone with even a casual interest in the 'Matrix' world.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|This must be one of the most beautiful records ever! I'm a long-time Sarah-fan from Norway and I'm really blown away by this music!<BR>I especially like the fact that it is so slow and melodic.<BR>This is Sarah's best CD I think!<BR>She's got one of the best voices ever!<BR>Her choice to write and perform the songs on piano certainly was a good one.<BR>&quot;Dirty little secret&quot; is my favourite so far!<BR>What a pity this CD isn't out here in Europe yet!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|It would be nice if all geeks, naysayers, cyberpunks, and self proclaimed philosophers could realize that this film (and the original) is not some spiritual, metaphysically mystical 'journey'; but a Saturday matinee sci-fi action blockbuster and a damn good one at that.  Nuff said.
0312319517|5.0|With his latest work, Forsythe is back with a vengeance.  This book is outstanding.  The central character, Calvin Dexter, is a complicated man.  On the surface, he is a successful small-town gentleman lawyer, who in his spare time trains as a tri-athlete.  Below the surface, he has a history as a highly skilled Viet Nam veteran and, as the reader comes to find out, in the present day operates secretively as the Avenger - the righter of wrongs for people with no where else to go.<br />As the story opens, the grandson of a very wealthy Canadian businessman is brutally murdered in Bosnia, setting the wheels in motion for a contract with the Avenger to bring those responsible to justice.  Forsythe effectively intermingles past and present to lay the foundation for the storyline, introduce a host of characters, and to bring meaning and motivation to Dexter's character.  Dexter has blue-collar roots and is an up-from-the-bootstraps success story.  Highly intelligent, although not highly educated (his law degree notwithstanding), Dexter comes from the school of hard knocks - able to think strategically and tactically.  He is a character with an abundance of courage, integrity and personal fortitude - all of which will be required as he goes up against seemingly impossible odds to fulfill.<br />Forsythe is able to effectively weave cultural and political facts and actual events into the story to provide a realistic backdrop for the action - and there IS action.  Avenger was very difficult to put down.  The story moves forward with pace - full of suspense and plot twists that the reader has come to expect from Forsythe.  For anyone interested in the action thriller genre, Avenger is a \\"must read.\\"
B0000AMJEH|3.0|Let's face it.  If you saw the first installment (99 out of 100 of you), you didn't watch the sequel with anything in mind but more hot chicks, more kick ass cars, and more spectacular race sequences.  From the moment the drawbridge went up in the first race sequence I knew this movie wasn't going to dissapoint (from those perspectives, of course).<br />The plot is textbook.  The cops are stupid (INCREDIBLY stupid).  The 'lead' actors are laughable (Paul's 'cuz-talk' actually makes for some of the most hilarious 'I'm trying really hard to sound like I'm from the hood' dialog I've heard in awhile!).<br />BUT...<br />There is eye candy everywhere.  The cars kick ass.  The special effects kick ass.  The races kick ass.  Anything to do with driving in this movie kicks ass.<br />Then, who really went to see this expecting anything but?  The movie delivers exactly where it's supposed to.  Defenitely worth the rent.<br />Let's see the '455 Rocket' as the star of #3!!!

6305428042|5.0|I'm a 16 yr old who still watches Disney(So sue me, I hate MTV and the Pop rage). I never knew this movie was in theatres until I read these reviews! I just finished watching Hocus Pocus on TV tonight and thought I'd look it up on Amazon to see if it were on DVD/VHS. This movie is a classic, and I watch it every time it comes on. I have the soundtrack, which consists of like 2 songs, on Kazaa Media. It's the greatest halloween movie of the 90s for kids, and even teenagers, because I know alot of kids at school like it as well. Hope this review will help someone out! I would recommend this movie to anyone-my dad says it's one of the few things SJP did that was decent acting, lol!
B00005JMFR|1.0|Don't waste your money. The original Matrix was a good movie, the second was terrible, and this one was horrible. It was difficult to stay awake during the first half. There were nothing but special effects which were difficult to follow, no plot that made any sense, very little of Neo, and no feeling for any of the characters. It didn't matter to me who lived or who died.  The only reason I stayed for the whole movie was to see the outcome.  I'm sorry that I did because I only got mad and felt like I was taken.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you like the heavier/technical side of DT and less vocals then this is the CD for you. <br />I just bought the CD yesterday. One word to describe this album 'WOW'!!!! The time changes and riffs are incredible... borderline orgasmic. I think that this is definately there heaviest album. There are still some classic DT sounds in it but most of it sounds to be newer and more aggressive. I prefer the vocals compared to previous DT albums (doesn't have so much of that early 90's melodic high pitched singing). I don't really pay much attention to the lyrics so I can't really comment on them... regardless there seems to be much more instrumental/technical stuff anyway. I have to say this is now my number one DT CD.
B00008BRB5|5.0|this is propably the finest Police album up to this day.<BR>Sting,Andy and Stewart created an album that contains many more commercial rockers but without a lack of their own style and experiments.&quot;Mother&quot; (short and wierd chaotic piece shouted by Andy)is the best example that they were not afraid of conroversies and loose of fans.<BR>as far as the time goes songs like &quot;Miss gradenko&quot;,&quot;Every breath you take&quot;,&quot;synchronicity&quot; or &quot;wrapped around your finger&quot; are sounding fresh,groovy and ,what is the most important, they all have the spirit of true genius in it.<BR>The police splited up after they recorded &quot;Synchronicity&quot; - propably because they coulnd't record anything so great as this album.only once you can do revolution in rock music without copying yourself. Police did it - and they gave us this timeless album.
0805062971|4.0|Since mostly males wrote reviews on this book, and the few female reviews rated it rather poorly and did not give it justice.  It may be obvious why males love this book, because the premise is males beating each other to bloody pulps to take out aggression in basements of bars in \\"fight clubs\\".  <BR>I have read this book countless times, and enjoyed it every time.  Although at times it can be gruesome and graphic, two traits that I do not particularly like in novels I read, this book really intrigues me.  The dark and cynical view of corporations is like a reality check.  The narrator, who is never directly named, but once possibly referred to as jack, takes you right into his thoughts and his dark humor is hilarious.  <BR>Although I do believe the book is better than the movie, which could possibly be due to my love affair with books, seeing the movie helps one understand the book better.  Since it puts things right out there for the viewer to see, as opposed to having to create it in your mind on your own.  Plus Edward Norton's amazing unmatchable acting skills make Palahnuik's contemptuous character much more complex and appealing.<BR>Fight Club's Tyler Durdan has become the object of many men's idolization, not to mention obsession too.  There are so many unforgettable situations and quotes from this book that just bash on everything from advertising to mothers.  <BR>Not everyone is going to enjoy this book, but if you do not mind dark humor and cynicism, I would recommend it.

0812505085|5.0|A tale of suspense, filled with pirates, hidden treasure, and a plot not soon forgotten, Treasure Island hits the top of the charts. When Jim Hawkins comes in to possession of the notorious Captain Flint's treasure map, a crew is rounded up and a hunt for the treasure beginns. Little do Jim and his companions, the Squire and Dr. Livesay, know that many of Captain Flint's murderous pirates are part of that crew. That changes though, when Jim hears something not meant for him to hear. He, the Squire, and Dr. Livesay are now unaware of who and who not to trust. It becomes a battle between the good and evil in a race for the treasure. Greed was a major aspect that caused many sailors to turn against what they knew was right; sticking with their captain and boat. But they wanted the treasure for themselves, and their greed consumed them. Just remember though, greed will not get you anywhere, as this book shows. All that it gets you is more trouble than you need. The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, uses foreshadowing, a technique that gives a hint of what is to come, that keeps you wanting more, and creates an atmosphere of mystery. Treasure Island is a \\"must read\\" for all who love pirates, treasure hunts, and a great story.

0783225849|5.0|&quot;Psycho&quot; is one of the best Alfred Hitchcock directed movies filmed.  An NBC special placed this movie as the #1 in the Top 100 Most Thrilling Movies.  This movie rightfully received four Oscar nominations including Best Director and Best Supporting Actress (Janet Leigh) for 1960.  Its original score won.  The music still holds as classic horror movie music to this day.  Many other features are well-remembered classics.  The &quot;shower scene&quot; holds as one of the most remembered scenes in horror movie history.  Many movies after &quot;Psycho&quot; have tried copying that, but nothing has compared to Janet Leigh's screaming in pain.  Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates wonderfully.  His efforts through his character alone give this movie the added terror.  The screenplay was wonderfully written, giving the terror the unique touch that audiences will remember for many years to come.  Bates's costume and personality symbolizes the uniqueness.  Those looking for a great horror movie should watch &quot;Psycho&quot;.  Everyone will be entertained.  Its conclusion will leave everyone shocked and breathless.

B00005JMFR|5.0|Don't listen to these \\"big time\\" critics and \\"hardcore\\" fans of the original Matrix.  If you think about it, the dialogue was never that great (I could figure out 100000 place to put a Woah in the script)These \\"critics\\" are just so spoiled from the first one that this concept doesn't suprise them anymore. Now, I'll admit... I was calling out the lines before they were even said in the theatre. But that doesn't take away from this movie.  They're are two storylines (Neo's and Zion's) and it ends perfectly.  Trust me, it's better then ReLoaded, not as good as the original, but hey, they hardly are... ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME THAT EMPIRE WAS BETTER THEN JEDI... I THINK NOT.
B000002LK1|5.0|There's a certain, special word that can be used for the best recordings ever... and that is &quot;perfect&quot;, and Violator, to my surprise, ended up being just that. Are you a dancer? A rocker? A poet? ... All of the above? Don't worry, this album does well for all three!<BR><BR>&quot;World in My Eyes&quot; sets a dark, deep and passionate mood, almost like Dark Side of the Moon (without freaking the listener out)... meanwhile, &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; is a catchy-yet-chilling tune about questioning one's religion. While certainly not an anti-Christian song, it encourages questioning one's beliefs, and not blindly throwing oneself into faith. Meanwhile, &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; continue the feeling set by &quot;World in My Eyes&quot;. Of course, all the tracks on the album could be mentioned as highlights... but that'd take away the point, wouldn't it?<BR><BR>Despite only having 9 tracks, Violator is just about flawless, and perhaps the best album of 1990... and one of the best of the 90s. Dance, rock... and think, think, think.
6303168507|5.0|\\"Schindler's List\\" is one of the greatest Holocaust movies made.  Its intensity is enough to catch the audience's hearts.  However, this is also one of the saddest movies because this actually happened, and so many people died.  Steven Spielberg directed and produced this movie wonderfully.  His every drop of energy is seen in every scene.  He presents the facts about The Holocaust and Oskar Schindler exactly.  Such graphic scenes give the crew tremendous respect for showing such details that few would dare.  The movie's quality deserved all eight Oscar wins, including Best Picture 1993.<br />The screenplay was written wonderfully.  Such quality allows the actors to portray their roles to the fullest.  The writers give every scene the brilliance and emotion, though most of them are sad.  Understandably, the emotion may make the audience cry.  The movie sets were crafted wonderfully, giving the realisms of the times.  Most of it doesn't look elaborate, but the construction took many months.  That time paid off.  The original score was composed very well.  The music follows every event exactly.  The acting was magnificant.  Liam Neeson (Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (a Nazi troop) deserved their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.  Their research through the events and their characters are presented in every scene.  All the other actors, major and extra, are also great.<br />Those who are sensitive to graphic nature may not want to watch this as it may upset them.  Otherwise, this is a great movie for those looking to remind themselves of certain historic times.  Behind the gore, the blood, the murders, the violence, etc. is one of the greatest movies in cinematic history and one of Steven Spielberg's best works.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|(4 &amp; 1/2 stars)  This set fills a void in Springsteen collections, between the &quot;obsessive fan&quot; quality of his two box sets (one live, the other all rarities) and the relatively sketchy nature of his previous Greatest Hits disc of studio material.  Now we've got two full discs many of his best studio AND live cuts (the classic &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; is one glaring omission), plus a complete third CD of rarities.  I've already given this Essential Bruce package the road test - it's GREAT driving music, especially disc one!

B000002BE9|5.0|Tidal is Fiona first and best cd. I love the power behind this cd. As a female artist she really put herself out there. You can feel her every emotion behind each of her song. Sullen girl is what got me hooked to this cd. Fiona maybe writing about her own emotions but when you listen to the cd you feel like she writing about you two. It always seems like the singer is misunderstood. When you hear music, listen to it read the lyrics it hard to belive that she could be misunderstood.
B00005JM02|3.0|The animation in this movie certainly is gorgeous--you'd have to be blind to not appreciate it--particularly the backgrounds. As in much animation of this sort, the landscapes (or in this case seascapes) are fantastic; the way the light dapples and shifts over the objects is quite wonderful. Also common to this type of animation is the strange rubbery or plastic-like appearance to the characters; they are lacking a certain amount of surface articulation that would make them appear more realistic.<br />Content. Oh dear. Aside from being hetero-normative (all the little fish are in male-female family units cranking-out babies) and sexist (Dory the dumb-blue, or is that dumb-blonde, female), it's just a painfully trite story. (I like Albert Brooks, but he just whines a little too much in this for me to take; the sad-sack fish business gets tiresome very quickly. Also--Great Barrier Reef...Australia...why do only some of the characters have Australian accents?)<br />So, the other big downsides to the content, for other than the most infantile viewer, are that it is unbelieveably formulaic; this reads like dozens of other bad kiddy flicks, just set underwater. The heavy-handed morality leaves me feeling beat over the head; I haven't learned anything from watching this, and no one else will either. Again, there is no real story in this movie--it's as if the Pixar people said \\"we can do this underwater thing--just tack any story onto it.\\" And when you get down to it, there is no character development at all.<br />Marlin's search for Nemo, and its concommitant chase scenes (yawn), is terribly predictable, and smacks of \\"future theme park ride\\" plotting. Nemo's character is obviously \\"future stuffed animal\\" and \\"future action figure\\" marketing. This film couldn't be more consumerist in its development; I find it offensive to watch something that is so blatantly geared towards either \\"The Sequel\\" or \\"Xmas Buying Season.\\"<br />So what do we learn by the end of the movie? Marlin is longer depressed, but equally unbearable, he's manic! (does he suffer from BiPolar Disorder?), and he's learned to let-go a bit. Nemo, perhaps, has a new-found respect for his father; and has learned not to go swimming off into the deep dark sea.<br />Is this the final moral of this film? Don't leave home; don't try new things; don't take risks... It's a sad society that supports such ideas for its youth; growth comes from risk, from developmental traumas, and from exploring what is new. I can't recommend this movie for anything other than the visual--in terms of content, there is definitely nothing new here.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona makes good of her sophomore effort. When the pawn is one of my most favorite cd's ever. I love the range in this cd. Every thing from a Cabaret type style to your classic ballads. Fiona has one of the greast female voice out there today. The ways she writes often makes you wonder if she's taken a page out of your  own dairy. This is a great cd to listen to when you: just broken up with you lover, when your mad, or sad,fed up, or looking for a change. In other words this is a great cd to listen to anytime.
B0000CFW87|1.0|You aren't fooling any one with that voice of yours, Josh.  I know poor singing when I hear it.  I have this CD, along with all his others and I am telling you to save your money and scrape your hands along a chalk board.  It gives the same effect.  You want a good vocal artist? try Barbara Streisand or Rod Stewart or even Cyndi Lauper.  Now there is a voice! I have listened to Josh's new CD Closer about 25 or 26 times and I can't stand it.  Oh sure I know all the songs by heart now, but oh what I wouldn't give to have my mind back.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie is great. This movie is funny. This movie had awsome music. In the grand tradtion of Guy Ritchie films Snatch is a dark comdey about London's underbelly. The story is center around Turkish and Tommy two boxing promoters who want a caravan. The decied (unwisely) to by it from Irish gypies. Brad pitt plays the hard to understand Irish bare-kunckle boxer who rips them of then lays up their boxer. From there all hell breaks loose. The more they try to get out of trouble the more they get into trouble. If you've saw and like Ritchie's first film then this is a must for you. If you haven't seen any of his films but liked any of these films: Ocean's 11, Go, Fear and loathing in Las vegas or Pulp fiction then you'll love this movie.

She is looking really beautiful now with the long hair.  Beyond that, this album is really well done.  It's like a continuation of SURFACING...and that is a great thing!  SURFACING is one of Sarah's best albums and the fact that she didn't change her sound drastically between outings is greatness to her fan's ears.  All of the songs on here are really good....I really didn't feel there were any real standouts.  You just need to get this one.....Sarah is something special.  Don't miss out on her!

B00005JM4Z|1.0|Talk about a crummmy job.  It's hard to decide which is worse - the acting, dialogue, photography, sound, &quot;plot&quot;, or racing. If you are a racing addict and want some perky babes at the same time this may fill the bill for a few minutes.  But that's all there is.<br />The plot must be the product of a &quot;Movies for Dummies&quot; book, some mixed-up story about crime and racing and deadlines and gals and friends.  The only thing more predictable than the plot is the acting which is straight out of Central Casting.  Even my son who loves this type of movie admitted it was a &quot;dog&quot; which, in any generation, means bad.  Avoid at all costs.
B000021Y77|5.0|I fell completely in love with this brilliant artistic film from the first moment that I laid eyes on it.  I got to say I'm pretty surprised I have not heard of it until now, in my English class. There is more action and emotion in the first 30 minutes of this movie than in BraveHeart, Matrix, and any Schwartzenegger film put together.  It is a film rich with color, sound, creativity, and non-stop exhilaration! <br />The plot is this girl named Lola has 20 minutes to get to her boyfriend and get him $100,000 before he is killed for screwing up a job. There is no time wasted on subplot, the subplot develops as the story moves on. The cool thing about this movie is that we not only see what happens as Lola scrambles to get the money, but we see it happen three times. Each time Lola's 20 minutes are up, we start fresh with a few things learned and try all over again.  What is admirable about Lola is her strong determination to succeed and conquer the obstacles.  She fights for what she believes, for what she trusts, and for what she loves.  <br />To me, the movie Run Lola Run is also a story of the little intricacies that you, me, and every other person in the world take for granted as we pass each other on the street and pass each other by and how those little meaningless nuances can change our entire lives. The difference between a person running into you and running by you is the difference between you being a baby-stealer and being a lottery winner.  The plot may have been simple but the acting was solid, charismatic and charming.  The film is so captivating in every aspect; it almost made me forget that this is a German film with English subtitles.
0792846443|5.0|Who but Kathy Bates could instill in those few words such drama and horror...&quot;I'm your number one fan.&quot;  Yeah!!   The story of a writer who is so fed up with the hero or heroine of his success that they are killed off is an old one. But how many authors have wrecks and wind up being cared for by a fan obsessed with Misery (the heroine) who demands she return.<br />Annie rescues the writer (Caan) and lovingly nurses him back to health...almost, that is.  She has one little demand - he must return to her the now-dead Misery.  And she has ways of making him do her bidding that grow ever more dangerous.  What is so impressive about this film is that the writers took their time and let the tension slowly build until we learn that Annie is just another madwoman on a mission.  <br />She beats and coaxes and jostles and tortures and pampers the writer as he begins his odious task. But oh what a surprise when she finally reads the conclusion!  A terrific fight and great ending to a movie that remained close to the spirit of the book.<BR>Rent it today.

0671027344|5.0|You won't come across a gem like this every day.  I'm 33 years old, but when I stumbled across this book almost by accident, it became an instant all-time favorite.  Chbosky's protagonist, Charlie, pulls you into his world where his experiences are all too relatable.  I won't compare this book to any other &quot;coming of age&quot; tales because &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; sets a new standard.  I read it in two days and the book is still on my mind.<br />Charlie is too real.  He'll remind you of friends, relatives, and probably a little bit of yourself.  Just read this book.  It's honest and heartwarming.  And brilliant.
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm not a big one for writing reviews, but this CD compelled me to do so.  It is brilliant.  Before I bought it, the only thing I knew of Coldplay was their song &quot;Clocks&quot;, so it was a risky buy for me.  Boy, am I glad I took that risk!  This is an amazing collection of music -- each song is unique from the other, with hints of many musical styles.  But the collection flows together beautifully.  Typically when I buy a new CD and listen to it the first time, I listen to each song a few seconds, then click forward to hear a sample of the next.  I couldn't do it with this CD.  Each and every song drew me in on the first listen, and I had to hear each in it's entirety.  I was in the car and reached my destination before the CD was over, so drove around aimlessly just to listen to some more.  The ballads are so stirring and moving, and the faster songs really groove without being overwhelming or too hard core.  Chris Martin's voice is just crackling and swelling with emotion and feeling.  He is an amazing talent, and literally takes my breath away in some of the songs.  This CD would appeal to such a wide variety of musical tastes because of it's diversity.  It's just good song writing delivered with more meaning than anything I've heard in a long time.  Don't hesitate to buy it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Train of Thought is awesome.  This is a must for all Dream Theater fans.  The band goes heavy on this cd, heavier then the last two.  Dream Theater makes sure to still make their songs complex, which is their signature trademark.  GO OUT AND BUY IT, this is good for any long time DT fan as well as new fans just getting into prog rock.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I was completely blown away listening to the new Dream Theater cd. These guys know how to write music. A lot heavier than I expected but that's what I have been waiting for. Just buy this CD you will thank me later.
B000002LSV|4.0|All of their great songs are here. From &quot;La Grange&quot; to &quot;Gimme All Of Your Lovin'&quot; it has all of their hits. The only thing that keeps this disc from five stars is that for some reason they included a dance version of &quot;Legs&quot; which doesn't measure up to the original song.
6304806442|5.0|i loved this film since the day it arrived in limited screen release back in 1996. i had never read an Irvine Welsh novel and wasnt quite sure what to expect. The only sense of British humor (including the great emerald isles, scotland and wales)i had seen in film before trainspotting is probably a fish called wanda. of course these two films are worlds apart from one another and an entirely different brand of comedy. the parts you are supposed to laugh at have you in gutwrenching hysterics and the parts intended to be a little more gruesome you're practically having to turn your head from the tv screen. <BR>the characters are beautifully illustrated and are very true to the characters presented in Welsh's novel. Renton (played by Ewan McGregor when he was still wet behind the ears) is the narrator and main character. he is surrounded by friends who share the same ambition as him, looking for their next shot of heroin. the things they find themselves doing are inconceiveable to the sober mind.the emphasis is the world that heroin creates and most certainly stops itself from glamorizing its use. the setting is a very dismal and gloomy Edinburgh, Scotland which is ideal for the storyline. <br />the thing most intriguing about the film is how you find each of the characters to be likeable and endearing in their own unique way. the world of &quot;junkie music&quot; is woven ingeniously into the film which clearly makes the two soundtracks an ideal accompaniment to the film. all of the performances are memorable and it created a new genre of filmmaking to come out of Great Britain. Visceral, hard edged, truthful and gritty are the words that will lean heavy on you once you've seen this film. Supposedly, Welsh is in talks currently to make a film out of the novel Ecstacy and should be out sometime next year. more scenes of pharmaceutical use and sheer pandemonium. Cant wait!
B0000CAQ26|2.0|well i was really excited to pick up pink's new album, but when i started to listen to it i was really disappointed.  I know she changed her music from r&amp;b to more rock driven, but it seems like she forgot where she started from.  What made her famous was those catchy r&amp;b tunes which u dont even hear anymore.  The only good songs from pink's new album is catching while i'm sleeping and love song.  If i knew the album sounded like this i would have saved my $13.  pink if u are reading this please come back to r&amp;b  we need you.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The action never stops! Even more importantly, the filmmakers managed to avoid the blood &/or sex scenes normally associated with this type of movie.
B0000CFW87|3.0|I heard the Josh CD in full today. Anticipating much I listened with full attention, but I don't get gripped by it. I will admit that his voice is beautiful, but to me, he lacks something. I must compare him to Russell Watson with 'The Voice' and even Mario Frangoulis.<BR>When Josh sings Secret Garden's You raise me up, it lacks the richness that the original singers brought to it..........plus the original song is in a higher key with a better arrangement.<BR>Same story with Caruso....................<BR>but the cd will sell very well.<BR>Many people do on about Josh playing piano on Remember when it rained. It's a simple piece to play.....nothing complicated!! Let's take off our blinkers and say that this is an average album.<BR>I like half of the songs on it.
B0000634EV|1.0|The first warning about the quality of this CD was the disclaimer that they wrote and recorded this album in 60 days. A first glance this sounds impressive. However, after listening to it you say to yourself, yeah no kidding you did this in 60 days.<BR>It sounds like it.<br />This album is nothing like NOLA, which would be fine, but Phil needs to either get off the H or back on it because the lyrics are hurting and the music is marginal at best.<br />If you have loved NOLA and do not want to ruin your image of Down, Crowbar, COC, and Pantera DONT BUY THIS PIECE or if you do get it used because it isn't worth $18.00.
0553277472|3.0|A very overrated book by college proffesors and other pseudo intellectuals, but nevertheless it makes a good fiction book.
0688163173|4.0|Just finished reading my first Dennis Lehane novel and will now defintely hunt down Mystic River et al. As a self confessed mystery buff (adore Pelecanos / Mankell/ Dibdin / Connelly)I found the quality of writing and plot line very satisfying in this novel but as per a few others here guessed the 'real' situation about a third of the way in. I dont care about that as its not the ending I read the book for but how the author gets me there, and Mr Lehane has a delicate yet powerful voice that held me through the night. The setting is disturbing and the final outcome convincing and affecting. I am still thinking back over the troubled life of Teddy Daniels, and his problems on reflection ring true - and truely horrific. A quick and high quality read from a my new favourite author.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Before being the sexy submissive, she attended the rather superior and notable Columbia University in New York City. That's right, folks. Maggie Gyllenhaal (who plays Lee Holloway) earned her bachelors in English at this well-acclaimed school. But who cares about where she got her acting schools. Man, where did she get those fabulous LEGS that we see on the case cover? But the real question is where in the world did she meet a character like Mr. E. Edward Grey (James Spader)?<br />Lee Holloway had just completed some time at a mental institution, where she was sent after her uncontrollable habit of self infliction. Returning back to her imperfect suburban home, she's determined to find the perfect job with her newly developed typing skills. As the incredible typing crackerjack she became, she applies at the small, private law office of Mr. Edward Grey. She gets dropped off everyday by her mother in a typical white station wagon to this ordinary, quaint, small brown firm. But is it really so ordinary? Hidden behind the walls and closed doors is leashed sexual desire. And hidden behind the face of Mr. Grey is a troubled past and self-conflict. But what is it? Will these two screwed-up minds be able to help each other?<br />This story of two troubled, isolated souls contains highly arousing yet beautiful dialogue.<br />\\"Now pull up your skirt...I said pull up your skirt...pull down your pantyhose and underwear...I told you I'm not going to -f- you...\\"<br />I guess there's no romantic implication in that given statement but doesn't love always come after pleasure and fun? Well, this film allows that to be true.<br />The movie does center on the idea of D&S (dominance and submission) and S&M (sadism and masochism). But we don't really see the actual role-playing and leather and vinyl clothing. However, we do hear the erotic punishment and discipline in the background with the sounds of spanking and cries. AND THAT can be enough to turn you on. Holloway and Grey enjoy this sexual pleasure, but you're in constant wonder, questioning actually how long this play will be able to go on. <br />\\"We can't do 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\" <BR>\\"Why not?\\"<br />I highly suggest watching this movie. You don't need to watch it with your friends. It's enough entertainment to watch it by yourself. Gyllenhaal and Spader act wonderfully besides each other. They keep your eyes wide open...
B000003TA4|3.0|When &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; hit the airways it was a high voltage jolt of youthful energy. However, it was 1991 the year music died. While I actually liked this record I can't accept the &quot;icon of gen x&quot; tag that Kobain has been dubbed. The music machine of labels suddenly wouldn't sign a band that didn't have a grunge sound. All that was allowed to survive and record were rap acts, boy bands and solo female teen pop idols. As important as the media says this record was its influence leads me to believe it would be better if it was never released.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|I wasn't sure if they would be able to come close to their last CD, Six Degrees ..., but its not bad.  There are the normal DT faire with the super fast solos, the sometimes over the top vocals, and the wonderfull drumming.  Somethings are lacking. I miss a lot of the bass guitar work that was found on Six Degrees.  JM is still keeping it going on the bass, he's just not as prominate as in the past.  That was a dissappointment for me.  Some of the guitar work has slid from the progressive more into a groove crunch thing.  Which isn't bad, its just different.  I'm not much for the keyboard side of DT, but seems like Rudess is doing his job and adding the musical layers that make DT great.  <br />As for the songs ... well all of them have bright spots, but sometimes they seem to get a little lost along the way.  I like the time changes and the progressive tendencies of their music, but it doesn't seem to flow as well in this record as in the past.  Which that could be with all the DT fans being spoiled rotten by Six Degrees and how well that album flowed.  Speaking of Six Degrees, yet again, if you liked Glass Prison it seems that This Dying Soul (track #2) could possibly be part 2.  I haven't read the lyrics yet, but that moster riff towards the end of Glass Prison shows its self once again.  You can look at that as either creative genious or lack of a fresh idea.  I think it makes all of their works flow together.  They did this on the last one too with the same white noise from the end of Met. part 2 flows to the beginning of Six Degrees.  The songs on Train of Thought are mostly rockers. You do have the one slow number being Vacant, which is the only one that James penned the lyrics to by the way.  The rest of the songs are done with all of the players writing the music and the lyrics are done by JP and MP except Vacant as mentioned above.  Pretty much the way it was done on the last one.  <br />You know you are going to have to buy this one if you are a DT fan, its hard not to.  If you are wanting to start here with your DT collection I wouldn't suggested it.  Go back to some of the earlier stuff and build up.  Overall I like it.  Can't wait to see what they end up doing on tour with this one.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|i watche this movie for the first time when it was first released and i ended up buying the DVD because i loved it soooooo much. The cars are just great!

055321263X|5.0|This is a great book. I was completely pulled into the world created by Wilkie Collins. The characters are great, the suspense is fantastic. The end notes were very helpful, as someone else said in their review. I just could not put this one down - I'd rush home from work every day and bury my head in this book. It is such a joy to find a book that has that effect!

B0000AZJXQ|2.0|ANTICLIMATIC is the word..<BR>this album takes you on a ride to nowhere... where is this brilliance i keep hearing about? i dont see it on this album, albiet the drummer is excellent however.<br />Im sick of hearing 'you gotta look behind the music' and all things similar.. i know music and this CD is plain boring.. its like they took too much acid and forgot to play songs that go anywhere... im sick of hearing about the genius of perfect circle.. how about listening to opeth's 'damnation' thats brilliance showing that in fact, 7-8 minute song CAN go places... -- <br />i wish tool would make a revival... maynard seemed to suite it to a tee.
B00008OLYN|4.0|When, I heard way back in late summer 2001 that Opeth's next album would be a double album, one heavy, one all laid back, I was beyond stoked.  I have been an Opeth fan since the time of the MAYH release.  My first Opeth was Orchid, followed the next week by MAYH and then by MorningRise.  When Still Life (666 stars out of 5)came out, I latched on to that and to this day, it is my favorite.  Blackwater Park's release was something as well, but I wanted more of the mellower side of Opeth.  <BR>So with the impending double album release I was excited. Opeth just kept getting better and better.  When the rerelease of BWP came out and the 2 new acoustic tracks came out, I was ready to get rid of all my other cd's (except my Buckethead).  Then came Deliverance.<BR>Deliverance sucked.  The extra stale production (heys wheres the wall of guitars?), coupled with, what I felt, were boring songs, made this the bane of my Opeth collection.  Its down there with Morningrise.  I was still looking forward to Damnation, though, I had that going for me.  Damnations' first eerie chords came to me through headphones, and I knew from that first listen, I was in store for some disappointment.  <BR>In My Time of Need, track 3 (I forgotthe name) and to spread the Disease, were about the only tracks on this droning, melancholy album,I repeatedly listened to.  I havent listened to it in well over a month (although to be fair I do have over 700 cds).<BR>If you are looking for great melancholy and truly beautiful music, check out Buckethead's Colma and Electric Tears cd's, and EVERYTHING by Nick Drake.  Mikael Akerfeldt pointed out Nick Drake's influence on the band's mellower side, so check it out.<BR>I gave this 4 stars becasue, it's good, even though it's pretty bad for Opeth.  It will be interesting to see where it goes from here.  Opeth's line up is perfect, and it's about time for anotjher great album, although to be fair, if not morbid, I think they jumped the shark, that shark living in the Black Water of the BWP.

B00000DCHE|4.0|this is THE BILLY JOEL LIVE RECORD!!, It doesnt matter if youre a beginner with mr joels music, this is a definitely must for any music fan. Here you will hear the highlights of his earlier albums, in much better vesiones, the way Billy wanted them to be.<BR>You will not find any major hit here but nevertheless, &quot;songs in the attic&quot; remain as one of the most electrifying record in joels career. Superb and powerful renditiones of &quot;captain jack&quot;, &quot;miami&quot;, &quot;los angelenos&quot;, delicate masterpieces like &quot;youre my home&quot;, etcetera, all in one album that by the way sounds terrific. Just buy it!.
B00000724P|5.0|Whether or not you agree with Metallica's social views such as file sharing, you have to admit this is an absolutely excellent CD.  In my opionion, this is their best CD, even though I also like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Load&quot;, and &quot;St. Anger&quot; very much as albums.  But this album is good both as every song on the album (including &quot;The Prince&quot;, a song reportably about Satan).  But this is Metallica at their peak.  The album itself would be worth it just for the astounding &quot;One&quot;-- I still get chills every time I hear that song.  The orchestration is like that of classical, yet excuted flawlessly in the metal context.  I'm sure every song was planned and written out before it was recorded, then done right like serious pros.  Even though I didn't like &quot;S&amp;M&quot;, you can understand the connection between classical and metal when you hear each song played.  &quot;The Prince&quot; is probably my favorite B-side (to &quot;One&quot;), and comparitively, it is very similar to &quot;One&quot;.  I have to say that &quot;One&quot; is definitely my favorite Metallica song, with &quot;The Prince&quot; coming in a close second, and I'm glad they are contained on the same album here, because otherwise you have to buy the bulky, hit-and-miss &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; to get it, or the single of &quot;One&quot;.  Really, I could go on forever about how great this album and essential it is, but if you have never heard this album in its entirety, it must truly be experienced to appreciate fully.  And if you are not accustomed to Metallica, give it some time to sink in.  It gets better with each listen because of the complex metal orchestrations.  Stand out tracks for me are &quot;Blackened&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Dyers Eve&quot;, and &quot;The Prince&quot;.  Hell, I could list all of the tracks, but then what would be the point?  So stop wasting time reading this and buy it already.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|Yeah, that's right I thought this movie was excellent with the exception of the rave sence which was just out of place i think.  I find little else to gipe about here.  It is a visual master piece that throws a few tidbits of philosiphy at you to make you think about the true relationship between the two sides in the film.  I found Reloaded to be more enjoyable than the first Matrix, truth be told I actually fell asleep during the first one(of course I saw it at 1 in the morning ;)).  This compaired to Shotgunning a large soda during the previews in Reloaded yet I was forced to hold it in since I could bring myself to miss a minute of it.  My favorite parts of this film were the highway fight scene and the conversation with The Achitect.  This movie has more action than the first and stil manages to throw you questions about what is really going on.  Why this movie is so commonly bashed escapes me, my only guess would be do to the hype.  As a dvd this is also a film with extras that I actually watched...yes I watch them all and found them fascinating.  I don't recomend you listen to all those disgruntled reviews out there, they are mostly passionate people who are angry that it is not like the matrix while simultaniously angry that it is too similar to the matrix.  While they are busy not making up their minds I suggest you go and buy this dvd because it is great fun to watch, and isn't that why we watch movies in the fist place, to be entertained?
B0000C0FJB|3.0|Time for my two cents. Yes, the recording quality is different from what you might expect from this band but if you are a long time listener, (I've been following Rush's career meticulously since Signals) you should have learned by now to expect the unexpected (especially as of late with Neil Peart's crisis and other member's solo recordings, outside projects, etc.) Clearly the band is at a point in its career where they are functioning differently (then again, haven't they always been?) and I believe that they expect their fans to realize this which is exactly the point of this recording: IT'S MAINLY GEARED TOWARD DEDICATED FANS! If you fall within this category you will enjoy the CD. If you are more of a casual fan (ie: you DON'T have EVERYTHING they've EVER released), then there isn't much point in laying down your hard earned cash for it. Spend your dough on Different Stages or the more obvious Exit Stage Left. My main reason for the three star rating is the lack of &quot;bones&quot; that could have been thrown on there; plus, many songs have already been done and re-done on previous live discs. YYZ sounds formidable and tractor-like (in other words awesome although NOTHING beats Geddy Lee's monster, tractor, Rickenbacker bass sound on Exit Stage Left). If I'm going to listen to Leave That Thing Alone, this is the version I will turn to (very raw, gut-punching, and pulverizing). And then there's the board recording of Vital Signs which I could listen to endlessly and never tire of. So yeah, if you're a serious fan, buy it. There's much of value here but don't expect anything as incredible as the live Farewell to Kings tour bonus disc included in the Different Stages set. What a gem.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Whether you liked \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" or not you'll probably find yourself going to see this one no matter how you look at it. To be frank, this isn't a bad movie and neither was Reloaded. But again, the first Matrix movie had a such a level of superiority that you couldn't top.  The things that were new and original are not anymore. Not only that but in this movie we spend LESS time in the Matrix.<br />As I mentioned in my review on \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" the second movie is only a bridge to the third one.  In this last installment things come together and it actually makes Reloaded look better.  The acting isn't bad although the dialogue could use a touch up.  They managed to explain how the Oracle looked different in a very believable way for The Matrix.<br />The dialogue however could use a touch up.  It isn't that the lines are stupid, it's one of those \\"I can't believe they said that\\" kind of messed up dialogue.  The other part where the movie falls short is that no matter what, the character Neo still has little emotion.  Even with his love-interest in Trinity we still see little emotion.<br />A lot of plot holes from the second movie are filled and it makes Reloaded look better.  But the overall plot of the film is actually a bit of a drag.  The story is interesting , but the plot is nothing special.  The movie is all about saving Zion, the last human civilization.  The problem is that the movie spends TOO MUCH time on Zion.  Expect this to be a war movie mostly, full of all the war movie themes of love, drama, and carnage of course.<br />Let's face it.  This movie was also overhyped, just like Reloaded was.  Overhype always tends to make a movie worse because we expect so much from it and then we don't get it.  This is no exception.  Revolutions is a good movie but it misses what the first two had.  That my friends is The Matrix itself.  The characters don't spend nearly as much time in The Matrix, so don't expect a lot of fight scenes.<br />Revolutions is only good to see once, however.  It isn't a bad film but that doesn't make it good.  Unlike the first two movies, you lose interest in Revolutions fast.  You see it once and then you know how it ends.  There are no really cool scenes that keep you coming back (I.e. the first Matrix had the Lobby Shooting Spree and the second one had the whole Freeway Chase scene).  This one is actually rather boring a second time because the movie is drowned out in a lot of dialogue and overlong emotional scenes.  The final battle is a little long and repetitive and as with the second one, you'll have to piece it all together.<br />The first two Matrix movies were better than this I would say.  At least the first two I could watch more than twice, but as I said, the first one set a bar that the next two films had to live up to, and they just couldn't do it.olutions is only good to see once, however.

B00001XT76|5.0|Even better than the Godfather. I have loved this movie since it first came out. I was very young at the time, and my mother says that if she even attempted to pull me out of the t.v. room when it was on, I would go balistic. I have had &quot;eyes&quot; for Patrick Swayze ever since. He did an outstanding job in this film along with Jennifer Grey. You feel their every emotion, and you tune into what the dancing means spiritually to their characters, and start to feel it yourself. By far, as I said, this was, is, and will always be one of the best movies in cinimatic history, and will forever always be my favorite.

They're all there yet only by stepping back - real far back- to the borders of the mind and beyond- is Langdon able to see them. What was Da Vinci thinking!?!?! It's the same concept as Seurat's pointilism. This is a great book and actually it made me pick up Chopra's new book as well where I found even more profound clues about real life. Great job by Dan Brown.
0385504209|3.0|I was disappointed after all the hype. This seemed like a Robert Ludlum type of layered plot. It had some good mystery, and some exciting escape sequences as the hero and heroine connected and tried to evade capture while figuring out the mystery. However, it all seemed so contrived to me that I had a hard time accepting it, especially the religious underpinnings. If you aren't too critical, you might enjoy the adventure, the romance, and the mystery.
B00005JMFI|4.0|This movie was hilarious!!! I couldn't stop laughing.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  James Caan is great in his typical deadpan role.  Will Ferrell is absolutely OUT OF CONTROL hilarious... even funnier than Jim Carrey would have been if it were him as the Elf!
0062502182|1.0|While the adventure part of this book is excellent, the rest of it was nothing more then common syrupy blandness.  Fairytale at best, cultistic &quot;good things happen from above&quot; at worst.  It was nothing compared to so many other books out there - I'm still amazing at the good reviews!?<br />I cant say its anything but mildly religious all life is good - purpose driven life - sort of style with a very luke warm story behind it.<br />Shannon
B000089RVR|3.0|Dido's voice is amazing, it's true. However, the songs on this album are somewhat forgettable. I do like &quot;White Flag&quot; and &quot;Life for Rent,&quot; but can't really remember any of the other ones. There's some techno-hip-hoppie thing that doesn't suit the song itself... and a mix of other music styles that don't seem to meld well.
B0000E1ALR|3.0|As I read the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews for this collection, all I can say is that Bruce will remain in business for years to come thanks to the sheep mentality of his fan base. The only reason for a set like this to exist is the Holiday shopping season is upon us and Bruce needs a product to peddle like anyone else. I love these apologists who see no problem buying 2 discs of \\"hits\\" just to get the coveted  \\"bonus disc\\" of rare material. I can see Gene Simmons doing this to the KISS ARMY types living in their parents basements, but Bruce is suppose to have integrity. What is even sadder is that the music gets progressively worse as the listener reaches disc 2. This is tough to read for some but play this thing with an open mind and you can hear the deterioration for yourself. In my opinion, the real Bruce left us at the conclusion of the River Tour over 20 years ago. Everything since then has been a well-crafted facade to keep his image as a working class hero alive and believable. Wake up folks, he's about as working class as Bill Gates.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Love Actually was a breath of fresh air compared to all of the other \\"Chick Flix\\" that have been released lately. Movies like this one don't come along often and haven't since Notting Hill, 3 Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary.  It is in true form to all of those. Bring your friend or bring your spouse-- I believe men will \\"Love Actually\\" this movie as well.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dreamtheater's new album was a great surprise. It is a lot heavier than any of the previous Dreamtheater releases and some songs almost seem to be Dreamtheater's answer to Metallica's somewhat failed attempt to go back to their roots with &quot;St. Anger&quot;. What does this mean? Well, just let the guys at Dreamtheater handle it, and they'll do it right. No, they'll do it a lot better.<BR>If you are a fan of the SFAM and SDOIT albums you might be very surprised by this new album due to it's predominantly heavy metal edge. Here and there you can even hear some death metal influences with Portnoy's rapid bassdrum successions. Nevertheless, melody is not entirely lacking with the presence of &quot;Vacant&quot;, a very slow balad, where Jordan Rudess's influence is very predominant.<BR>Anyways, this CD is a must for any Dreamtheater or prog rock fan. You won't be dissapointed.
0800128052|3.0|Don't we get enough &quot;Fighting Irish&quot; on NBC?  Please.  All I can say is that this poor kid gets abused for an entire season (forget about the self abuse he inflicts upon himself while growing up) just so he can play a few lously plays for Notre Dame....  Barfola.  18-12-1 Michigan record vs. ND.  Last score 38-0.  don't believe the hype
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I bought this album this morning, as I normally buy Celine's albums on the first day of their release.  I have all of Celine's other French albums, but this one stands heads and shoulders above the rest.  The style and feel of this album is nothing short of AMAZING!  This is by far her best album (English or French).  Even if you don't understand the words, the feeling of the music is enought to inspire.  Great, great, great album!
0385504209|4.0|I read the book in two days. It was really quite good and really questioned a lot about what I believed in fact or not.  It brings alot of questions to the table about Jesus, the paintings of all the great artist.<br />I have to agree with some of the reviews that the ending could be a tiny bit better but overall VERY EXCELLENT. I highly recommend it. Oword of advise is to read it with an open mind and a lot of it IS FICTION.
B000009ED0|5.0|This CD is a unique mix of hardcore Rock and explicit Rap lyrics and simply the best to ever come out of the Rock/Rap scene. Even after the releases of History of Rock and Cocky this is still Kid Rock's best CD. Nearly every track, with the exception of I Got One For Ya and Welcome 2 the Party, kicks ass. <BR>Best Songs:<BR>-Only God Knows Why- Listen to it once and you'll get hooked.<BR>-F*ck Off- An angry, hardcore rock/rap mix that gave us all an early tast of a young rapper by the name of Eminem, who at the time, had just recently signed to Dr Dre's Aftermath label.<BR>-I Am the Bullgod- A great rock tune with an awesome hook that has an original sound.<BR>-Bawitdaba- The first single was impressive, not the best song on the album, but still good never the less. Good song to blast in your car stereo.<BR>If you don't have this CD by now, then do yourself a favor and buy it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh's sophomore album does not disappoint. He has advanced on many levels and indeed his featured song list proves that his voice and style are maturing. However,there seem to be more 'romance' languages than English on this CD. Yet, that is what makes his songs more interesting and challenging.
B00005JM02|5.0|&quot;I'll call you squishy, you shall be mine, you shall be my squishy&quot; says Dory the blue, short term memory loss fish to a small jellyfish near by! This movie is wonderful. It's cute, it's funny, it's silly, it's sweet and it has a great meaning to it. It's great for all ages. You will want to watch it over and over again. If you are anything like my nieces and I you will find yourself quoting little things that Dory says throughout the movie because they are so funny and memorable!! It's classic!
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is so easy to love. The colors and the fluidity of the ocean, the fish, the people, and the scenes in Australia were absolutely wonderful. It felt like you were looking at reality rather than a cartoon. I cannot even call it a cartoon because every detail was accurate. The light and dark shadows were accurate with the real coloring of the ocean. The perspective of the diver, big fish, little fish, coral, ocean, the dentist, and the boats were perfect! <br />The voice of Albert Brooks was definitely the key to making Marlin (Nemo's Dad) the nervous and serious fish. Marlin sounds like such a negative thinking fish. This is right in line with Albert Brook's other movies. Ellen Degeneres adds a style and humor into the fish of Dory. What is not to love about that playful fish with a short term memory loss! I laughed every single time she said something. The fish could not be depicted with any other voices. Her ability to read and speak whale were hysterical. <br />Nemo sounds like any other kid always testing and doing the opposite of what a parent says. His innocense helps to make the story flow. <br />If any adult wants to enjoy what is supposed to be a kid's movie, this is the one! I do not think it was created to be for kids. Otherwise, the plot would have been simpler or less realistic. While there are some touchy scenes that I will not say to avoid spoiling the movie for others. You will truly love this movie! I wish the movie went on forever. I know this is going to be watched every minute of the day. I just hope the DVD player does not wear out! HAHA!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'm a student in high school and I think this film is marvelous! Yeah, there are cute guys in it, but if it sucked do you really think anybody would sit through three hours (and more on the extended) of agony? If it's so \\"boring\\", how come it has made almost a billion dollars at the box office? Not only is the storyline of the film fantastic (due to Mr. Tolkien) but Peter Jackson is an awesome director and everything on the film is top rate. The cinematics, the score, everything! Before seeing the movie, I would never think of reading the book but now I have come to love both and this movie is by far true art!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I'll preface this with saying that DT is my favorite band, and my fave DT album is Images and Words, so I was hoping for something along the lines of Six Degrees, which was freakin awesome also.  I liked &quot;As I Am&quot; when I first heard it before I purchased the album, but then when I listened to it through I was kind of turned off by the ever-present  pounding and rumbling that kicked your rear seven times to sunday.  Sure if you like that kind of stuff, this is the best, but I was looking forward to more melodies.  Of course this is just an initial review- I've already listened to &quot;In the Name of God&quot; again and liked it much better the second time.  Hopefully it'll grow on me.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Directed by Mark Waters (Mean Girls, Head Over Heals) this is one of those rare remakes where the premise is the same but the twist on modernizing really works. It is funny and extremely well character developed.<br />The story is that of a modern day mom and daughter who are opposites and at odds with each other. All mothers and daughters argue and in the heat of the moment may say things they really dont mean at the time.  Through the mystical magic of an Asian Woman and a fortune cookie the mothers get the wish  they switch bodys and not for any particular time period  but they get to go back when they realize what their relationship is all about.<br />It stars Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, True Lies, House Arrest) in one of the best comedic performances in her career. She is so great with her timing and attitude  because she basically goes from being a middle-aged woman to a teenager. He use of the language, mannerism and her comic timing is perfect. Jamie is clever and inventive and took her performance to the top. She is hysterical in the real business world playing her mother- a Lawyer.<br />Supported by Lindsay Lohan (Life Size, The Parent Trap) as her daughter who sharpens her performance as an overbearing, professional middle-aged women in a teenagers body.<br />They spend the remainder of the movie trying to figure out, very comically how to get back into each others original body.  Mark Harmon (Chicago Hope, Wyatt Earp) plays the sympathetic and confused fianc&eacute; for the recently divorced Jamie Lee. The little brother played by Ryan Malgarini (Gilmore Girls) gets caught in the middle and is hysterical in his confusion.<br />This film is great fun for the whole family. And will be available in December on DVD. Dont miss it. It is very good and extremely wholesome. (11-10-03)
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|This DVD is just confirmation that Coldplay are among the most talented musicians in pop culture today. With this live performance, we see Chris Martin really involving the audience, he further proves his vocal prowess and stage presence is as great as anyone else out there. Coldplay is the first band I have encountered that actually sounds ten times better live than they do on their CD's (which are also excellent). I found myself drawn to songs that I was never too fond of on the CD's, but are so incredibly moving live, such as &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; (that is one that NEEDS to be heard live). Also, the fan favorites such as &quot;Yellow,&quot; &quot;Clocks,&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; have never sounded better. There's also great exclusive songs in this concert, including the B-sides &quot;One I Love,&quot; which is a very up-tempo and catchy song, and the very sweet acoustic song &quot;See You Soon&quot; that almost makes me cry, and the new song &quot;Moses&quot; which is just excellent. Also, this performance features the classic &quot;Shiver,&quot; a song that Coldplay has not performed in ages and a live version of which is very hard to come by. The directing is top-notch on this DVD, as is the sound quality. On top of this wonderful DVD, you get a VERY good quality CD of the performance, which is now my favorite Coldplay CD. When you hear thousands singing the lyrics to &quot;Trouble,&quot; you can't help but get goosebumps, and you realize that this band is not a &quot;flash in the pan,&quot; that they will be around for a very long time, and their music will be around for longer. If you are not a huge Coldplay fan, you will be after viewing this DVD, and if you already are, then needless to say, this DVD is a must.

0385504209|4.0|I bought this book in an airport at the beginning of an unexpected 4 hour delay.  It is a honest to goodness page turner.<br />Not a work of history.  Very fast paced.  The quality of the ending is on par with the quality of the premise/plot.  I finished the book several hours after I arrived home.  Beware, it is hard to put down once you start.
B000099T2L|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS OFF THE HOOK AND SHE IS MUCH BETTER OFF SOLO.<BR>IT MAY BE LIKE 2 SONGS ON THE CD THAT NEEDS WORK BUT THE REST ARE GREAT ESPECIALLY YES AND SIGNS..I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CHECK IT OUT
B0000CDLA7|5.0|The first time I saw the album title, I thought it would be a deep thoughtful cd. But as I sticked it yesterday for the first time in my player, I said &quot;WTF!&quot; And then listened to it over and over for like 6 times in a row from the begining to the end.<br />Definitely one of the best from Dream Theater. I just couldn't say what's my favorite song, as all the songs are just masterpiece, really, I can't find any weak song on it. But if you ask me which is the first song that caught my attention, I would say the 5th and the 6th track. The lyrics are very strong, they are not weak at all: listen to the last track &quot;In the Name of God&quot;, it totally reflects today's situation.<br />As I said, this is definitely one of the most powerful progressive metal album, powerful yet meaningful.
B00003CXCS|5.0|Great DVD, with *tons* of extras to keep you amused for hours. All you need now is the 35th Anniversary 2-disc cd set and the SOM: The  Making of America's Favorite Movie book by Julia Antopol Hirsch and you'll be the Ultimate Sound of Music fan! :)

B00000IAU3|4.0|I think that you have to be in a certain mood for certain music.  This is one of those types of music that you need to be in the mood for.  I like the other reviews on this CD, but at the same time, I know that I really like this CD.  I started listening to Dido when she did the song with Eminem, but I was more interested in her song than the rap that Eminem did (hailing from detroit, I must give props on Eminem on a song that with less airplay might have actually carried some meaning) but anyways, I listened to the rest of the album and realized that &quot;thank you&quot; was really only the tip of the iceberg.  She is very talented and spending the $12.00 is well worth it if you remotely like what you have heard on the radio.<br />As one very famous quote goes &quot;Good music is what you like&quot;.  Whether this CD is technically sound, or congruent is irrelevant, the fact that it is good is.

B0000E1ALR|5.0|No doubt designed for music fans who don't own many Springsteen albums, this double CD has selections from every studio album of his 30 year carreer. There are many great tracks that weren't on his 1995 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD: Rosalita, Jungleland, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Nebraska, Tunnel of Love, The Ghost of Tom Joad, The Rising, American Skin (41 Shots), and others.<br />As a big Springsteen fan, I of course recommend buying the albums themselves, but if you just want the &quot;essentials&quot; from 3 decades of music, this is it.<br />The BONUS Disc is pretty cool too. It has tracks from his whole career. &quot;None But the Brave&quot; &amp; &quot;County Fair&quot; are 2 'Born in the USA' outtakes could have been hits if they'd made the cut. These 2 songs I highly recommend. Anyone who digs Springsteen will love these tunes!<br />There's also some rare tracks Springsteen wrote for movies directed by friends Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, &amp; John Sales. These songs are not like his usual music but are very good.
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is just about everything a good fiction novel should be. The topic is fresh and interesting, Dan Brown obviously has a command of the material, you'll learn a great deal while reading it (a la Crichton), the story is a page turner and Brown's prose is okay - about what you'd expect for this type of book. However, it *is* fiction, and before you run off and renounce your belief in a Christian god who isn't a woman, it's wise to remember that. As a work of fiction, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" succeeds greatly. As a text to present facts, it is much less successful. Unfortunately, while I would love to just judge the book on things like characters, plot and dialogue, there is a great deal of information in this book that is presented in a very one-sided fashion that while entertaining, will certainly serve to confuse opinions of an already distraught religion.<br />I would liken Brown to a magician. A magician is one who creates an illusion, the audience buys into that illusion completely, and thus we have magic. Brown achieves the same result with \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" He is able to convince the reader that the very world is at stake within the outcome of this story, and that Da Vinci's opinion on a topic is as authoritative as the Bible itself. He accomplishes the first task by alluding to supernatural secrets early on, but very gradually reveals that this \\"world changing\\" secret is nothing more than the conspiracy theory of some cultish history club. However, Brown does it in such a way that we don't even notice it and the \\"secret\\" seems important right up until the end of the novel. This is not an easy thing to accomplish as a writer and it's why I say Brown largely succeeded. (I'll come back to this.) He achieves the second task of making the reader believe in Da Vinci's opinions as gospel by showing us things we've never seen before about his paintings, even though they are right in front of us. For the reader who looks up one of these painting on the internet and follows Brown's analysis of it, it can be startling and before you even realize it, you've forgotten that Da Vinci was just a man with an admittedly warped point of view. This ends the book review. What follows is a short commentary on the topic itself.<br />First, what's the validity of this secret of the Knights of Templar? Brown writes about their secret documents and what they say, and asserts that the originators of the Bible kept those works out for political reasons. This is conspiracy speak at its best. The fact is when you delve into the documents that weren't included in the canonical scripture, yes they say certain things that seem to contradict other areas of the Bible. But many of them also contain areas of factual inaccuracy, such as historical inaccuracies, that deems them of a dubious source. Compare that with the four Gospels - the most researched, time tested writings in this planet's history - and almost no discrepancies in transcription have been found, even with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Furthermore, the logic that these documents were left out for political reasons is a little sketchy, since including them in the canon would only have tightened the cords between paganism and true Christianity, which is what the conspiracy \\"experts\\" assert Constantine was attempting to achieve. Lastly, how important would revealing these secret documents be, even if they directly contradicted established biblical truths? Would the foundations of Western culture come crumbling down around the black hole of the Catholic Church? I don't think so. Just because these documents, if they even exist, say something other than established scripture says, it doesn't mean they are accurate, especially considering they would be presented by people of a very strong theological bias which automatically questions their credibility. At best, all it would do would be to expose a slightly plausible alternative to traditional Christian texts, something thathas stood the test of thousands of years and hundreds of scholars. Change the world? No more than Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses or Christian Scientists have, and probably less. There are masses of historical documents that say any number of things we as a culture don't largely believe. This would only be one more set. And most of what Brown criticizes about organized religion applies to Catholicism only - the horrors of the crusades, the intertwining of paganism with Christ - these things were largely addressed by something Brown conveniently ignores, something called the \\"reformation\\" which has given us the entirety of Protestantism, a tradition free from the Papal influence he calls into question.<br />And at the end of the book I was left feeling Brown had done an excellent job of making something out of nothing. He had given the façade of importance to a discovery that would probably make national news, might merit a National Geographic channel hour-long special and maybe would give those few remaining Catholics on the fence after their priests unthinkable actions an excuse to bail out.<br />So we're back to fiction. As a work of fiction, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" stands strong. I just hope people don't take it too seriously.has stood the test of thousands of years and hundreds of scholars. Change the world?

B00005JLWN|5.0|WTF, Man I was disappointed I didn't hear about this film earlier, I accidentally picked up this film at the local hole in the wall video store.  I was disappointed when I found out that is was only released in selected box offices.  It's a film that is unknown about and it's a hidden treasure.  HINT: See &quot;City of God&quot; another hidden treasure, you won't be disappointed.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album gets better the more you listen to it. Simply amazing. I'm not a hard-core DT fan, but my favorite albums always were Change of Seasons and Images and Words (in this order). I think this one steals the top spot.<br />Gread job (and, should I add -- great artwork on the CD itself!).
B000088E6D|1.0|I can't believe I actually wasted my time listening to the entire CD ONCE.  It's time that I want back, more than the money that I want back.  This CD was rush released just so Buble can earn more money in a hurry, before his 15 minutes of fame are up.  Furthermore, he's releasing another CD this month (November) for his Xmas album, combined with his first self-titled, so called &quot;limited edition&quot; album so he can generate even more revenue.  Limited edition.  Add a few songs and the text &quot;Limited edition&quot; and you get more $$$.  What a novel concept.  Wait, it gets better.  He will also release the Xmas album in December, for those who &quot;can wait&quot; and therefore, can purchase the Xmas album without spending the extra cash on his first self-titled album, albeit in a &quot;limited edition&quot; form.  I do admit that his first album is all right, but with this &quot;Totally Buble&quot; album and his upcoming albums, I think Buble is taking his fans for a ride and are underestimating the intelligence of them.  Come on Buble, wait till you produce something decent before you churn out more of this kind of junk, just so you can build to your bank account.  To top it all off, this is a very short album!!!  I think they should rename the CD &quot;Totally Over-rated.&quot;  This would perfectly capture the theme of the man and his music.  Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to give 0 stars!!!
B00000DGUG|5.0|I am one of those 40-year-old male friends (or so I wish) who has most, if not all, of the 21 things Alanis wants in a lover. I'm working on moving towards thriving in a job that helps my sisters and brothers; we all are at some level of striving. It makes little sense to write a song-by-song review of this record, as though my words will somewhow attempt to convince you to purchase it. But I will say that those who have not heard SFIJ with open ears are missing a marked moment in time. A creation of such naked, unfettered genius that it bears comparison to Hopper's Nighthawks, DaVinci's La Giaconda, the chants of Hildegard of Bingen, the Parthenon, a bonsai. A moment of seizure, where the Universe's essence is expressed through the hands, heart, voice and vision of this woman. The Jews say that their god's name is \\"Yahweh\\" which translates in English to \\"I Am\\". I've always thought this was the best name I've heard ascribed to a deity, because the Universe is one loud, never-ending scream of awareness. Here, the deity is Alanis herself, and she sceams in tones at once hushed, shrill and sensual in her awareness of herself, those she loves, that which she reviles and of a whole world of experience. I get the sense that this record sprang fully formed from her head, free of self-censure, editing or care for the pedestrian desires of the marketplace. Those who would criticize the so-called \\"stream of consciousness\\" vocals are blind to their meaning. Alanis is not singing these songs; they are bursting forth from her. She brims with power and what she needs to say will not be stemmed by conventions of meter or rhyme. I am reminded of the elegant word \\"Arumugam\\", which in the Tamil language is rougly translated, \\"six faces\\". The vocals at the end of \\"One\\" best demonstrate; you can hear the six faces around her head all singing together as she gives her voice to the Universe itself. As in the video for \\"Thank You\\", she stands before us naked, truly in all her glory, and challenges each one of us to do the same. Are you willing to stand with her? I AM. All hail the Goddess.

B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam cannot release a bad album because they don't know how to play bad music.  'Lost Dogs', a great collection of bsides, rarities and songs from compliations is completely mind blowing.  Ed shines on 'Footsteps' and 'Hitchhiker' and McCready guides us into guitar heaven with his amazing riffs in 'Yellow Ledbetter'.  This 2 disc album features amazing songs from every era, the only downside to this album are the songs that aren't sang by Ed.<BR>'Sweet Lew', though a good chorus just doesn't cut it.  Ament should stick to bass guitar if he knows what's good for him.<BR>'Whale Song' is kind of boring<BR>'Don't Gimme No Lip' sounds a lot like 'Mankind' off No Code but there shouldn't be any doubt why.  Stone.  Probably would be better if Ed had lead vocals.<br />But seriously, the unreleased tracks that are featured on here such as 'All Night' and 'In The Moonlight' are brilliant.<br />Though all the songs are each in their own way amazing, I am a little disappointed with some songs not making it on here.  For instance, where is Leatherman?  Long Road?  I Got ID?<br />But songs like 'Fatal', 'Sad', 'Down', 'Hold On' and 'Hitchhiker' make up for it.  'Fatal' is probably one of the best Pearl Jam songs ever written.<br />'Gremmie Out Of Control' is Pearl Jam with a California twist on it.  I love the background yelling (thanks Stone).  It's always a fun song.<br />In all, any Pearl Jam fan would definitely enjoy this collection and I'd recommend it to any alt/rock fan.  It's truly a masterpiece in its own.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is an absolute masterpiece. ANother hit for Pixar. The animation in this movie is absolute top of the line. The script is great and there are the moments that the movie is serious and the moments where it is silly. I think the greatest voice (and character) in this movie belonged to Ellen DeGeneres (Dory). She was great as a bumbling forgetful fish. This movie is a must see.
0880389052|5.0|One of the Best, if not the best book in the Forgotten Realms Genre. This book is incredibly original, with intriguing characters and villains alike. R.A. Salvatore brings the underdark alive with this book. The whole trilogy is right on par, so don't stop with just this one.
B00005JM0B|3.0|Like many people, I was waiting years for this to happen; a third entry into the Termiator legacy. But I became weary when Cameron refused to do this sequel, I mean he is GOD in series. He wrote and directed the first two. When Terminator 3 came out, I went to see it expecting it would be a step down from the first two. It was. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it. It's a great popcorn picture, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first two. Terminator 3 goes for a more cornball approach with its cheesy jokes and one-liners. Sure there was a touch of that in Terminator 2, but they seem to go just a tad overboard here. Also, the actor who plays John Conner...what the heck? If this guy is supposed to save the human race, we're doomed. This guy is weak and is a wimp. Miscast at the highest. Overall, the film is very entertaining with its nonstop action. Don't try to think of the plot holes too much and you should have a good time. A worthy entry into any DVD collection.

B0000BYM3K|3.0|Good album, but not new ideas. DOD is far to be the best realization of iron maiden. Only four songs have the maiden standar: &quot;Montsegur&quot;, &quot;Paschendale&quot;, &quot;Face in the sand&quot; and &quot;Age of innocence&quot;. The others are a replication of the ideas in BNW, XF and VXI. Four songs between eleven?. Is a poor contribution. <br />I am fan of maiden for twenty years, but when I listened NPFD, I thought &quot;The sands of time will run more speed than they want it&quot;.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|So how does a band try to follow up its last two highly acclaimed concept albums? The answer quite rightly is they haven't even tried. Writing a third concept album in a row could lead to acqusitions of DT treading in well worn tracks!<br />So what of the new album? Seven songs and a running time of 70 mins proves we're still on progressive territory here, but what is surprising is than rather than go for subtle complexity here the band have gone straight for the jugular and offered up a barrage of heavy and intense riffs. Make no mistake - ths is easily their heaviest and darkest offering to date.<br />Essentially the album offers all the DT trademarks we have come to expect, but i suspect it may lead to criticism for some fans for being overly heavy and lacking in structure and melody compared to their recent releases.<br />I've been a huge fan since 'Images' but my favourite songs have always been their 'colder' songs like The Mirror, Scarred, Burning My Soul, and The Glass Prison, so from my point of view i'm very happy, but how fans of their last two albums will view this album remains to be seen....
0679777547|3.0|Murder, Mayhem and Lust in the Stacks: Book Review of The Club Dumas, by Arturo Perez-Reverte, Vintage International, English translation copyright 1996.<br />Club Dumas takes us through various deaths, book deconstructions, women beating up guys or seducing them, and many late nights discussing attributes only book lovers would adore. All of this is accomplished after repeated draining of (different) gin bottles.<br />The author's love of books, literary life and all the glory that goes with it, is palpable and embodied in the lead character. Corso draws us in. He is an antiquarian book dealer who manages to keep the plot roiling. The unbelievable (and sometimes uncool), rough shenanigans only accentuate his off-kilter, hell-bent hormonally-driven, damned, Dashell Hammettesque bad boy nature. His take on life is quirky enough to lure the reader to continue reading, even in the spots where the plot loses course.<br />One does not have to be a Dumas aficionado, nor a Three Musketeers familiar. Arturo Perez-Reverte fills us in as we go. He continuously anchors the story at to the Three Musketeers and doings with the devil. Corso simultaneously recounts Dumas life facts and searches for copies of The Nine Doors,, a fictitious, ancient text. This manages to careen the reader through subplot after subplot. All in all, the story, with its plethora of literary devices, is too fantastic. So back to Corso...<br />His bad boy non-availability has sensuality, mysticism and romanticism folded into it \\"In the girl's eyes, silent eyes and without memory, he could see the reflection of ghosts from the past, he could feel them brush his skin.\\" And \\"He is falling for a very young woman, an apparent devil. For a brief moment, in the pulse of her flesh all Lucas Corso's previous deaths came to life, as if brought by the current of a dark, slow river whose waters were as thick as varnish.\\" Corso is repeatedly described in wolf-like terms...Club Dumas possesses such a hook at the beginning, intriguing and curious characters through the middle but ...alas...the ending veers too far-afield, and the story falls apart. Still, it's worth reading. Amid great character development, literary tidbits, interesting descriptive detail, and saucy, insolent one-liners, we can always find the lupine-like Corso. Oh, yes, did I mention that Corso is a romantic \\"And the girl. That was all that remained on the shore after the tide went out.\\"
0316096199|4.0|While I was not impressed by Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones (considered it to be severely overrated), I was deeply affected by her memoir, Lucky. Her account of her rape at age 18 was the most gripping peice of writing I have ever read; I actually felt physical pain. While feeling physical pain is not usually my goal when reading for pleasure, I credit Sebold for writing with such authenticity that I actually felt I was experiencing it myself (unfortunately, it also had the effect of heightening my fear of rape). The rest of the book discusses the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, including the rape trial that took place the following year, and is peppered with commentary that comes with 20 years' hindsight. There is something to be gained from this memoir -- quite simply, raw insight into the experience of rape. While I agree with other Amazon reviewers that Sebold does not delve sufficiently into the long-term effects of her rape (the \\"rest of her life\\" is crammed into a short portion at the end of the book), I appreciated this book so much for what it was, and didn't look further to what it could have been.
0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's 2001 novel Life of Pi has had a meteoric climb into the literary and cultural pantheon in the past two years: critical and commercial success, a movie deal, unbelievable word of mouth, a strong stint on bestseller lists, and the prestigious Man Booker Prize.  This is a fairy tale story for an amazing piece of literature that truly deserves of all of these accolades.  Martel has created a novel that evokes such strong emotions from its readers that after having read the last page, one wants to go out and tell everyone they see-strangers included-to read it immediately.  <BR> The novel focuses around a truly charismatic teenage Indian boy, Piscine Molitor Patel-wonderfully self-nicknamed Pi.  The novel begins in contemporary Toronto with Pi as an adult man, recalling his story to an unnamed narrator.  Part of the literary achievement of the novel lies in Martel's deliciously cryptic origins of the story itself.  The author's note as a preface works as a convoluted message from the narrator-Martel? A reporter? Another author?-telling his readers that he has \\"interviewed\\" the adult Pi about his story as the basis for the novel.  This immediately informs the readers that the novel can be read a number of ways, but predominately through the voice of a storyteller.  <BR> As Pi begins his story, he is a teenager in Ponticherry, India, in the 1970's.  The son of a zoo owner and a loving mother, the brother of a wonderfully lovable older brother, Pi is of course a special boy.  Aside from the narrative advantages given to Pi, he also actively practices Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity-all simultaneously.  The curiosity and spirit that drive Pi throughout the novel are reminiscent of a young Scout Finch.  Reacting to a tumultuous political and economic climate in India during the 1970's, Pi's father decides to migrate the family to Canada in the hopes of a better future.  During the nautical journey to a new home, the ship mysteriously sinks leaving Pi aboard alifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a Bengal tiger-also making the move with the Patel family to a new Canadian zoo home.  <BR> As Pi comes to terms with his tragic reality, he also must confront his imminent danger: how to survive the sea and more importantly how to survive with the Bengal tiger, Richard Parker.  Throughout Pi's adventure on the sea, which lasts roughly two hundred pages of the text, his wits and courage are constantly being tested.  At this point, the novel marvelously flows page after page with the reader eagerly anticipating what his next move will be, all the while keeping an eye on Richard Parker.  It is an amazing testament to Martel's storytelling that the novel could be read solely in terms of an adventure-tale in the vein of Robinson Crusoe or even television's Survivor.  Yet, it is during the course of Pi's journey that the heart of the novel is revealed.  Reflections on life, religion, Everyman's path, time/space are subtlety yet richly woven into a debate.<BR> By placing human and animal in such close proximity, Martel strips bare the barrier between the two entities.  There are numerous discussions of zoomorphism, domestication of animals, and personification of the animals themselves.  This effectively works to tame all of God's creatures and throw them into the same cage.  Pi must learn how to coexist with Richard Parker if he is to survive his traumatic journey.  Metaphorically, this works as a lesson revealing that we all must learn to harmoniously live together if we are survive our individual and communal journey.  This also frighteningly works as a metaphor for all of the fatal tensions in the world today.  <BR> In terms of religion, Pi's story is as potentially relevant in today's society as the story of Noah and his ark.  Martel has stripped away all exteriors and preconceived notions both in the character of Pi and also in his plight.  It is positively absurd for a man to practice three conflicting religions simultaneously, yet Pi executes such a task so effortlessly, one is left to question: Why not? Why is it so difficult for Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh, Palestinian, Israeli, American, Iraqi to live together in harmony as Pi does in his head and aboard a lifeboat for two hundred days with a ferocious tiger?  Martel's main achievement in this novel is how he deftly discusses issues with so many dangerous ramifications in such a way to not only produce thought in the reader, but provoke the reader to react.  <BR> Martel has a lot at stake with Pi's story.  While the novel could delightfully be read through the eyes of an adventure-seeker, the overarching metaphors and lessons learned through Pi's survival translate into issues that are critically prevalent in today's global landscape.  The narrator of the novel informs us that this story has a happy ending.  Although the price of this happiness is costly, Pi does survive and flourish in his new life.  Working as a fable, Pi plays the role of Everyman who finds a way to survive on his own terms.  His religion and morals remain intact; he ends up with a wonderful new life with a beautiful new family of his own.  Martel does not lay out a roadmap for how to live the life of Pi, he simply places integral pieces of the complex puzzle before his reader's eyes in the hopes that we are somewhat more prepared to tame our personal tigers.
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles, set the hits that the Go-Go's couldn't deal with. Is no lie that the Go-Go's were pioneers in girl bands, but, the Bangles took the crown for chart success, all their singles from their first LP(excluding their first EP) and on became top 40's.  Their styles infuse a taste of good time all through the 80's that will stand in time as a great rock-pop icon. It was extremely delightful to see all four members sharing vocals, and still sounded with the same great Bangles beat that made them stars.  The well written lyrics, the amazing orchestrated instruments, reflected that this ladies weren't a stroke of luck, no wonder they are back together, give it up for The Bangles.  Highlights in this collection are &quot;Manic Monday&quot;(those lyrics), &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot;(stuck in your head), &quot;In Your Room&quot;(rock anthem), &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;(elevator music classic) and &quot;Hazy Shade Of Winter&quot;(great instrumentation).

This is to find the new hier to his legacy. It also tells of his family's inner feuds to try to claim the fortune for themselves. This book is very well written and the story is superbly told.<BR>     Troy Phelan a very wealthy nam, committed suicide upon completing a revision of his will. He made drastic unimaginable changes and left the majority of his fortune and business to his daughter, Rachel Lane, who was unknown to the rest of the world.<BR>His greedy children began challenging his will, and trying to argue that their father was not mentally stable. They believed that they had more rights to his fortune than thier new mysterious sister. As a favor to get him back on his feet, the job of tracking down the new found daughter was given to Nate O'Riley, a washed out lawyer just out of rehab. The daughter was believed to be on a missionary assignment in the jungles of Brazil. Where many obstacles stood in his way.<BR>     The author did a great job in portraying the ruthless greed of the Phelan children. They were superbly described and were given very colorful backgrounds and problens. The lawyer was also given a very interesting background and his struggle with alcohol throughout the story keeps you wondering if he will fail or overcome. The journey into the jungle was very exciting. It kept you wondering if he would ever find her.<BR>     \\"The Testament\\" is a very well written book. It has adventure, suspense, drama, and betrayal. It has the struggle of the children with the lawyers, the struggle of the lawyer and drinking, the adventures into the jungle, and the anticipation of ever finding the mysterious daughter. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It will keep you wondering what will happen next.
B000002J1M|5.0|I've owned over a thousand albums at one time or another.  I can't say for sure which is my favorite of them all, but the 1972 album &quot;Foxtrot&quot; is a strong contender.  The songwriting was more consistent than on the preceding album &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, and the band had a year's more experience playing with new members Phil Collins (drums) and Steve Hackett (lead guitar).  The mediocre production and lack of synthesizers keep the album from having as good a SOUND as some of Genesis' later works, but the overall songwriting and musicianship were at their all-time peak here.  You can't consider yourself a true Genesis fan and not have this album.<br />The centerpice is Genesis' masterpiece, &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;, which is undoubtedly my favorite song, a 23-minute epic in seven acts that begins on multiple 12-string acoustic guitars, moves on to Peter Gabriel's hilarious &quot;Willow Farm&quot;, and ends big with the ominous &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; (Tony Banks playing a 4/4 organ solo while the rest of the band repeats a 9/8 riff) and a cathartic ending that reprises earlier themes in widescreen Technicolor.  It's awe-inspiring, and far better than the &quot;Seconds Out&quot; version.<br />The other songs are all good, though not in the same league as &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;.  &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; sounds the most dated today -- its opening wall of Mellotron string chords doesn't sound as big and powerful now.  But the song's unique 6/4 rhythm and sci-fi lyric, about an alien coming to Earth only to find humans have moved on to other worlds, are both strong.  &quot;Time Table&quot;, a rumination on medieval times, is the most straightforward song, with piano ballad verses and a swelling chorus.  &quot;Get 'em Out by Friday&quot; is surprisingly relevant today in a time of gentrification and soaring housing prices.  The interplay between the musicians is the best of any song on the album, and the song pauses in the middle for a slow duet of Gabriel on flute and Banks on Mellotron flute that is held together by Collins playing behind the beat.  Hackett has referred to Genesis' music as &quot;songs that started out at point 'A' and occasionally ended at around point 'Q'&quot;, and &quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot; is a perfect example, a 6-minute microcosm of what early Genesis was all about.  The song starts with Hackett and Mike Rutherford on 12-string acoustic guitars and moves through a series of unexpected changes, including Banks playing a rare solo on Mellotron strings and one of his trademark arpeggio solos on organ, and a fine guitar solo by Hackett.  &quot;Horizon's&quot; is a brief Hackett 6-string acoustic solo piece that functions as an intro for &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)

0743243307|4.0|I am a devoted fan of Indian novelists, those particularly observant writers who miss no detail while creating intensely personal landscapes of time and place. In Brick Lane, author Ali examines the life of Nazneen, a young Bangladeshi wife. The young woman settles in a London enclave filled with other Bengali tenants, all seeking assimilation while maintaining their cultural identity. Surrounded by familiar objects and customs, the immigrant community is constantly assailed by the inevitability of Westernization.<br />Following custom, Nazneen dutifully accepts marriage to the much older Chanu. Nazneen is an obedient wife, settled now in her London flat, her homesickness brightened by letters from Hasina, Nazneen's sister, who flaunts tradition by marrying for love. Over the years, the differences in their worlds are apparent, as the letters they exchange reflect their diverse paths. Through their letters, Nazneen examines her days as mother and wife, governed by minutiae, while Hasina is often at the mercy of changing circumstances.<br />Bengali lives are governed by strict traditions. While eyes watch and tongues wag with gossip, most of the women shun Westernization. Still, there is a profound cultural disturbance beneath the surface of the Bengali's world. It is nearly impossible to make a decent living; most are forced to work demeaning jobs to support their households, regardless of education and among the young people, there is a growing unrest. Some embrace the new lifestyle, while others are outraged by the implicit denial of Islamic tradition.<br />Nazneen is patient, wedded to her fate, but the couple's two daughters are a constant irritation to Chanu, especially the oldest, who exhibits the usual teenage angst. Accepting employment as a taxi driver, working nights, he finally acknowledges the sad truth of his diminished job prospects. Borrowing from a moneylender, Chanu purchases a sewing machine for Nazneen so she can do piecework for a local manufacturer, contributing to the family income.<br />While doing this piecework, Nazneen meets a young man with revolutionary dreams who yearns to direct the local Muslim population away from secularization and back to strict religious traditions. Karim picks up Nazneen's sewing daily and befriending her, he gradually challenges Nazneen to redefine her priorities and unquestioning acceptance of Fate's directives. For the first time, through his eyes, Nazneen views herself as a woman.<br />This is a small story on a large canvas, the universal struggle of people searching for personal definition and quality of life. Like pieces of a quilt, Ali stitches her eccentric characters together with subtle precision, from kind-hearted, plain-faced friends to hawkish moneylenders bleeding customers dry and pedantic old men longing for their birth country. While they trudge through daily difficulties, dreaming of home, most Bengali's accept their gradual acculturation, if unwittingly.

B000001ES9|3.0|Well, no, not really.  The band that recorded this album was three kids in their early 20's who really dug bands like Led Zeppelin and Cream.<br />And it is almost painfully obvious how much they liked Zep and Cream, because on this album more than any that followed it, Rush is wearing their influences on their sleeves.  The main riff of &quot;Take A Friend&quot; is a blatant ripoff of &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; for example.<br />Although the album bristles with energy, Geddy Lee just wasn't quite the lyricist that Neil Peart is (to be fair, Ged did write a few later Rush tunes, and the lyrics of My Favorite Headache aren't too bad).  And John Rutsey's drumming is only slightly more creative than Phil Rudd's.  And this album has the most unpretty cover of anything Rush ever did.<br />But, hey, it's got &quot;Working Man.&quot;  And there are plenty of brief flashes of what they would later become, even if most of the songs don't age well.
B00005MP58|5.0|This film is the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice!  Casting of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was brilliance on the director's part.  Even though the movie is roughly 5 hours long, it's the best five hours you'll spend on a movie because the film is so close to the book.  I'm glad they came out with a DVD version so the movie is now on two discs instead of 6 videos.  The DVD extras on the making of the film are worth watching as well.  Even if you have never read the book, the film is easy to follow and pulls you into the story that Jane Austen brilliantly tells.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Forget for a moment the acting, direction,plot and script,Heat is a film that has managed to pair two of the greatest actors of all time, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. No matter where you go around the globe, ask any person from any culture who his/her favorite actors are and two names will invariably always come up, Pacino and De Niro. To cast these two 'giants of method acting' in one film is a great achievement in itself, and makes Heat a film to be reckoned with.Surely Pacino and De Niro have been in the same movie before, Godfather 2, but as they played the young dad Don Corleone and the old son Michael Corleone, they never actually shared a scene in real time before Heat.<br />Now forget about Pacino and De Niro for a moment, and let us look at the film itself.<br />Heat is the best gangster movie I have seen since the two Godfathers, and this is despite the somehow over the top and sentimental ending which was slightly uneven compared to  everything that happened before in terms of style, plot and tone of the picture.<br />What works so well in favour of the film is a fine direction and script by Michael Mann, and great acting from all involved, Val Kilmer,Tom Sizemore, Ashely Judd, Jon Voight, Ted Levine and Amy Brenneman.<br />It has one of the best bank heist/street battle scene I have ever seen.<br />The plot offers much more than your average cat and mouse chase between cops and robbers: it is evenly focused on the thefts as much as on the drama,and the domestic life/problems of its characters. The characters in Heat have a three dimensional and deep personalities, so much so that you come to know the principle players so well, and whether they are good or bad, you can't not help but feel sympathy and concern for them.<br />The film is quite visual too and we get to see lingering and beautiful shots of LA, especially at night.<br />The bond that eventually ties cop and robber is very well written, two similar men but at the opposite sides of the law develop an understanding and respect for each other, and this adds so much to the film.<br />All these elemets make Heat a movie that should not be missed..one that will entertain you,involve you and delight you with its excellent direction, script and the meeting of two giants.lop an understanding and respect for each other, and this adds so much to the film.<br />All these elemets make Heat a movie that should not be missed..one that will entertain you,involve you and delight you with its excellent direction, script and the meeting of two giants.

Although Colplay is still a band in its seminal stages this CD/DVD collection offers and eclectic collection of the bands material.

B000094PYH|5.0|With this 1973 album Led Zeppelin continues to cause trouble by offering an album cover by Hipgnosis with naked blonde children climbing a bunch of rocks without any reference to the title or even the name of the band. The group figured everybody would know about &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and insisted on finding new ways of tweaking their noses at the music business beyond producing songs that were way too long for AM Top 40 airplay. There were those of us who were just happy that there was an official name to Led Zep's fifth album after the previous one was known variously as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV,&quot; &quot;Runes&quot; and &quot;ZOSO.&quot; &quot;House of the Holy&quot; is very similar to that album in that once again there are no length blues tracks as you would find on their first three albums, although we do have John Paul Jones playing with his synthesizer on &quot;No Quarter,&quot; which became his signature song. What we do have are more examples of Led Zep's version of rock 'n' roll where the bass lines and Bonzo's drumming come up big with &quot;The Ocean&quot; and &quot;Dancing Days,&quot; as well as the folk influence on the acoustic beginning to &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away.&quot; We even have one of the better examples of Led Zep being cute with &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; (&quot;Me wife is going on vacation.&quot; &quot;Jamica?&quot; &quot;No, she's going of her own free will...&quot;) and the group's first attempt to try to duplicate the success of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; with the lush synthetic strings of &quot;The Rain Song.&quot; Actually, I think the opening track, &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; is a better effort along those lines, covering much more ground both musically and vocally. You always get the feeling that Jimmy Page is always looking for the perfect song to not only start off an album but to open a concert, which probably makes it ironic that the song they apparently used most often was &quot;Rock and Roll,&quot; the second track from their fourth album. Overall, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is probably the best of the second level Led Zeppelin albums; the second track from their fourth album. Overall, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is probably the best of the second level Led Zeppelin albums

Thanks to Shady records for this one.<BR>Best Songs:<BR>-Lose Yourself- This track is incredible...5/5...one of the best hip hop songs I've ever heard and one of the biggest hits of Eminem's prestigious career.<BR>-8 Mile- A great beat combined with frustrated lyrics that'll get you pumped. Great for the locker room.<BR>-Wanksta- Sweet Jesus here comes 50 Cent. Need I say more?<BR>-Love Me- Obie Trice, Eminem and 50 combine their lyrical skills for a deep and smooth hip hop song.<BR>-R.A.K.I.M.- The master himself has returned! Rakim is back, and he's signing with Dr Dre's Aftermath label...he contributes this sick track celebrating his return.<BR>Now some people were disappointed with this CD, but the true hip hop fans realize how good it is. If you haven't heard it yet, go buy it and you won't be disappointed.
B000002AS3|5.0|The rebirth of British rock 'n roll in the 90's.  A classic album; up there with Nirvana's Nevermind, The La's self-titled, The Stone Roses' self-titled, Guns 'n Roses' Appetite For Destruction, and The Smiths' The Queen Is Dead.  Noel Gallagher at the pinnacle of his songwriting ability.  Must have for true rock 'n roll fans.
B000009ED0|5.0|This CD is a unique mix of hardcore Rock and explicit Rap lyrics and simply the best to ever come out of the Rock/Rap scene. Even after the releases of History of Rock and Cocky this is still Kid Rock's best CD. Nearly every track, with the exception of I Got One For Ya and Welcome 2 the Party, kicks ass. <BR>Best Songs:<BR>-Only God Knows Why- Listen to it once and you'll get hooked.<BR>-F*ck Off- An angry, hardcore rock/rap mix that gave us all an early taste of a young rapper by the name of Eminem, who at the time, had just recently signed to Dr Dre's Aftermath label.<BR>-I Am the Bullgod- A great rock tune with an awesome hook that has an original sound.<BR>-Bawitdaba- The first single was impressive, not the best song on the album, but still good never the less. Good song to blast in your car stereo.<BR>If you don't have this CD by now, then do yourself a favor and buy it.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This is a great collection!!!!! One of the best things about this collection is it starts at the beginning, 1973 with classic cuts from Bruce's 1st Columbia album, &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park NJ&quot; and works its way to Bruce's latest LP &quot; The Rising&quot;. Every track included on the set along the musicial journey is justified, no filler. 2 cd's of Quality classic and timeless Bruce. Then also included is a 3rd CD of bonus, mostly unreleased material, these songs could have been hits in their own right. The old sloppy put together  &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album is for the most part worthless and not needed now. This is the collection to beat all collections, the one to own!!!!!!!
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I have all Celine's albums since 1990 but this is one of my favourites! Its her best since 1997 ''lets talk about love''multi-million seller.If you know french or not it doesn't matter here, the songs are so good and her voice sounds so nice that you will love it ! great songs are ''le vol d'un ange'',''tu nages'' , ''je lui dirai'',''mon homme'',''contre nature'' ,'' des milliers de baisers'' and the most AMAZING french song she has ever done ''RIEN N&quot;EST VRAIMENT FINI''- its musicality you can feel it! It comes from the heart! I could go on about how good the album is but buy it and see you will love it! Unfortunatelly the album did not sell well in the Uk (due to a lack of promotion also) - just to show how bad the music industry is at the moment - this is a masterpiece!Forget about her last 2 albums ---- Believe me this is Celine's best french album so far!
0385335482|4.0|I finished this book in a weekend.  It was a lot of fun, and such an easy read.  Very close along the lines of Bridget Jones' Diary as far as story line and the thought process of the main character.<br />Becky's shopping problem and ability to justify her purchases is so easy for me to relate to.  Any woman who has a bit of a shopping problem and is considering the book, do give it a try...you will not be dissapointed.
B00008NRL8|5.0|I have to recognize that Im reluctant to write here about what I think about a CD, but this album is really special, and Id like to recommed this to all the ppl, who are now reading this and is not sure to buy it or not...pls do it ...you will enjoy it, as well as your friends or couple.<BR>This is not a very difficult work to hear...just get a drink, sit down and listen...great piece of work.
0156027321|3.0|Tee book is composed of two sections, first section is about animals in a zoo and religion. I found this section rather boring. The second section, the story of pi, a teenager, on  pasific ocean is interesting and worth reading. This is the first novel I read from Yann Martel and I should admit that I bought the book because of the back cover, which says he is like Italo Calvino. Please, don' t read with high expectations, he is not like Calvino.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|that knock this album and give it anything less than 5 stars.  This album is still better than 99.99% of all the CDs out there. Vocally, she has never sounded so good or natural.  Her song writing has somewhat toned down, but what do you expect, she's settling down in life (marriage and kids).  Although she doesn't have that cryptic edgy somber energy from her previous albums (where it peaked in Solace), it's still a very good album.  My only disapointment is that she didn't include one of her patented instrumental non-lyrical pieces (a la Last Dance and the likes of what you'd hear in Touch).
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am an avid fan of Josh Groban, and was mesmerized by his self-titled debut album, but I must say &quot;Closer&quot; caught me off guard a few times.  I was expecting a very similar sound to that of the first album, and to some extent it is.  But Josh uses some completely different vocal techniques on this album that listeners of the first album may need some getting used to, along with different musical styles.<br />Some highlight tracks would be &quot;Mi Mancherai&quot; (with an excellent performance by Joshua Bell) and &quot;Si Volvieras A Mi.&quot;  &quot;Oceano&quot; is a great opener and &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; is another favorite of mine, just for some good ole inspiration and a touch of Irish gospel.  <br />While this album is different from his last, it is definitely just as wonderfully made (although for some listeners maybe a little too melodramatic in places.)  His voice is as beautiful as it ever was and he seems to be discovering other avenues in which to use his God given talent.
B000001G5A|3.0|With all due respect to Karl Bohm and the Vienna Symphony, all one has to do to is listen to Robert Shaw's version, with the Atlanta Symphony, to come immediately to the conviction that these stodgy tempi are completely ill-conceived.  Nowhere is this more evident than in comparing the two versions of the Rex Tremendae.  Shaw's version captures ever so much vividly the image of the awful Judge come to separate the sheep from the goats than does Bohm's fly-stuck-in-molasses weightiness.  The flames of the Confutatis positively crackle in Shaw's rendition; here they are tepid and uninteresting.  Sure, the sonics are outstanding, the playing first-rate; but this bloodless rendition fails utterly to capture the pathos of this Mozart's final opus.
B000001Y79|5.0|This is one of those CDs that everyone will love.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Coming of age in the 80's, I can remember that I longed for the rocking 70's... Dire Straits seemed to fill that void. However, I was always doubtful about Mark Knopfler's solo efforts and didn't give him a chance... until now. (What a mistake!) I just ordered this CD and it's been in my CD player for the past two days. I love the bluesy celtic sounding &quot;Fare Thee Well Northhumberland&quot; with his wonderful riffs accented by the piano. This is so fresh and new to me, for I have grown weary of the repetitive sound of Classic Rock radio and can't seem to connect with the sounds of today. I don't think there is a bad track on this CD. <br />As a footnote, I have been a fan of Sonny Landreth since the CD &quot;South of I-10&quot;, and while scanning the credits, I see reference to Mark Knopfler on a couple of tracks. Which the is very reason why I decided to purchase &quot;The Ragpicker's Dream&quot;. This music doesn't fit into  what record companies would call a &quot;marketable&quot; genre... which is good, because that means it's really good music. <br />So if you're weary of commercial music of today and you want something fresh, but familiar, then I recommend The Ragpicker's Dream.
B00006SKRX|4.0|I greatly appreciated the remastering of this album. My complaint from the very beginning was that the first run sounded okay, but that subsequent copies always seemed muddy. This CD goes a long way towards correcting that.<br />This album is not for everyone. If your first exposure to Pink Floyd was anything by Gilmour &amp; Ezrin's &quot;Pink Floyd, Incorporated&quot;, you'll be sorely disappointed by this album .If, however, you grew up listening to Pink Floyd with Roger Waters, you'll be okay. This is definitely not a Pink Floyd album. It was written around the same time as The Wall, so there are similarities, but purists would complain that it suffers from the absence of Gilmour, Mason and Wright (who for some purists were always the elements that rounded out Waters' pathos). Eric Clapton more than makes up for that.<br />I'm not going to claim that this album is easily approachable. It's not. It's a great album, but it's an immersive experience, and as such requires more of the listener's concentration that most people are comfortable with. I rarely put this album on unless I intend to listen to it in its entirety. Its scope is much more personal than most of Waters' other work, which is (Amused To Death, for example) more global. I would recommend approaching this album with an open mind. If you're looking for a quick shot of pop candy, talk to Mr. Gilmour. If you're looking for a work with a solid underpinning, then give this a chance. You won't regret it, and the remastering brings out a lot of the ambience.
B000007T1M|5.0|I love this cd, it is TOP. My favorite song is DDevil. The lyrics in their songs are complex. And serj's vocals are so versatile he should be the modern day role model for vocalists.
B00006IM9Q|4.0|Everyone else has upgraded their original best of's, why not &quot;Blondie&quot;? This is a superior cd because it has every track from &quot;Best of Blondie&quot;, plus seven more, and remastered. Besides the hits &quot;Heart Of Glass&quot;, &quot;Call Me&quot;, &quot;Rapture&quot;, and &quot;Atomic&quot;, it has a few of their earlier songs, and their last huge hit &quot;Maria&quot;. I would have liked a track or two of &quot;Debbie Harry's&quot; solo stuff, but no big deal. Otherwise, there's really nothing that the casual fan should miss, and anyone with an interest in disco, new wave, punk, reggae, or dance should love this. It'll go great with your &quot;Cars&quot; and &quot;Pat Benetar&quot; cd's.
B000001ES9|5.0|If you want Tom Sawyer style Rush, buy Moving Pictures.  Many folks don't like this album because they started out around the Permanent Waves stage, and can't appreciate this for what it is.  The band has changed.  Regardless, this album jumps out at you from the beginning with the guitar licks on &quot;Finding my Way&quot; all the way through &quot;Working Man&quot;.  Granted there are no fancy synthesizers,instead electric guitar winds through all songs.  No fancy drum solos, but who cares.  Lyrics?  Come on!  This is rock and roll!  This album takes it's place alongside the early AC/DC, Aerosmith, Triumph, Nugent, UFO and other 70's bands.  No death, dismemberment, satanism of today's heavy metal, but just straight ahead grooves.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|There's only a few bands around who's b-sides are as good as their a-sides. &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; is one of those bands. This is so sweet. It collects many of the songs that didn't make the cut for each album, stray singles, compilation tracks, and 11 previously unreleased cuts. 30 in all. The only well known songs here are &quot;Last Kiss&quot; and &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;. It's kind of like a best of collection, but of unknown songs. There are things missing, like &quot;Crazy Mary&quot;, &quot;Soldier Of Love&quot;, and anything from &quot;Singles&quot;, or &quot;Merkinball&quot;. I'm sure a fanatic could dig up even more. But of what's here, it's 2 cd's of unheard greatness, essential for the real fan. Now where's that &quot;Soundgarden&quot; b-sides?
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Okay, let's be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music .. her roots. This album was targeted mainly for french and Canadian people, but it's topping the charts all over Europe, because of its quality!<BR>It is a musical piece of art which combines folk with blues and some irish shades. With tremendous guitar arrangements played by the amazing Gildas Arzel each song turns into a living nostalgia.<BR>Her voice is relaxed as it's never been, and she doesn't try to force it to hit high notes.. she just sings with her heart.<BR>even if u don't speak french, u'll love this album for its musicality!!!!!!!!! GO AND BUY IT -WON'T REGRET
B0000039QA|4.0|I can never decide if I like this more than &quot;Ready To Die&quot;, but I definitely like it. Besides being one of the best rap albums ever, it's also one of the only 2-disc rap albums that's any good, along with &quot;All Eyes On Me&quot; from &quot;2-Pac&quot;. This includes the huge hits &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, &quot;Sky's The Limit&quot;, and &quot;Mo Money, Mo Problems&quot;. Other phat jams are &quot;F-in' You Tonight&quot;, &quot;I Love The Dough&quot;, and &quot;Nasty Boy&quot;. Overall it's an impressive, and classic double disc. I'm amazed he has no &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; yet. I mean, take the best from &quot;Life After Death&quot;, throw on &quot;Juicy&quot; and &quot;Big Poppa&quot;, plus a few extra's, and there's a few more bucks in &quot;P. Diddy's&quot; pocket.
B00007E8V4|5.0|SOAD have done it once again. With the release of a third album, they have yet to disappoint their humble fans. My favourite songs would have to be Innervision, Roulette, and Streamline. Roulette is an acoustic, which we've never heard from SOAD, but they did a great job!...I love the guitar's in Innervision and Streamline. Classic SOAD style with a bit more of an edge!...Can't wait for the 4th Cd!
B00000IOSU|4.0|All around a very good live album. It doesn't have all her best, but it's close. Included are the bigger hits &quot;Building A Mystery&quot;, &quot;Possession&quot;, &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;, and &quot;Adia&quot;. One that always makes my wife cry is &quot;Angel&quot;. I'm also glad to see the beautiful &quot;Good Enough&quot;, and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;, from the &quot;Brothers McMullen&quot; soundtrack. The only song I wish was here is &quot;Into The Fire&quot;, even though it might not fit with the others. Overall this is an amazing live album full of her more well known songs. It'll go great with your &quot;Tori Amos&quot; and &quot;Natalie Merchant&quot; cd's.
B00005A46T|3.0|I really like the riffs and style and it has really good production, but it sucks on how SOLD OUT SATANIC the words are. <BR>Good music though.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|I suppose no &quot;Springsteen&quot; collection will ever please everyone, but this is a step in the right direction. This is a huge improvement over the skimpy &quot;Hits&quot; disc, but as always with an artist of this caliber, there's songs missing. Even as a casual fan, I wish this included &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;, &quot;State Trooper&quot;, &quot;I'm On Fire&quot;, &quot;My Hometown&quot;, &quot;Better Days&quot;, &quot;57 Channels (and nothin' on)&quot;, and if I really had my way, &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;. But enough complaining. What's here is all classic &quot;Boss&quot;, from his debut, to &quot;The Rising&quot;, and currently with a third disc of extras. This is something for old and new fans alike. It'll go great with your &quot;John Mellencamp&quot; and &quot;Tom Petty&quot; cd's.
0316666343|4.0|This book is really good but it was really hard to read. Usually I can sit down and read a book in a few hours but with this book it took me a few months. I would start it and have to put it down. It just brings so much emotion with it. But, I would reccomend it.
B00005176F|4.0|When you own over 700 cd's, it's hard to find the time to listen to them all. That's why I love the best of &quot;Blur&quot;. It has everything from the first song I heard, &quot;Boys And Girls&quot;, to my favorite one &quot;Coffee And TV&quot;. It also includes the excellent tracks &quot;Beetlebum&quot;, &quot;Tender&quot;, &quot;She's So High&quot;, &quot;On Your Own&quot;, and the huge &quot;Song 2&quot;. I'd say if you know any of these songs, you'll like them all. Each one is catchy and well crafted. This is also available as a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; import which comes with a bonus disc, 10 tracks live at Wembley Arena. But that's fairly expensive, and this should be fine for any casual fan. It's Brit-pop at its best.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is mind-boggling. To contradict comments made by other reviewers, nobody in this band is under-utilized. Nobody. But you have to listen carefully and know what's going on well enough to understand why. Many things you hear are more than what you think they are. This band is actually one of the greatest ensembles ever. And I mean with regard to ensemble playing. Many lines that may at a cursory listen appear to be a guitar line or a keyboard line are actually both playing together - combinations of guitar/bass, guitar/keyboards, drums/guitar, guitar/bass/drums, you name it... all abound on this CD. And it's not always obvious that you are hearing that. The players don't just go on individual tangents, but rather play insanely TOGETHER (call it a tangent, but if it's done in this type of synch, it's well thought out). Also, at the end of &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; is probably the craziest unison thing I've ever heard. The end of that song is insane. The songwriting aspect is as strong and melodic as ever. The band then expounds from there to their many instrumental forays. This is DT's heaviest album ever - heavier than &quot;Awake,&quot; but also one of their most progressive albums (as much so as &quot;Six Degrees&quot; or &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;). If you love prog or metal buy this immediately. This is one of DT's best ever. If you like the song &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; from &quot;Six Degrees,&quot; this album is definitely your cup of tea. I'd give this 6 out of 5 stars if I could...
B00005JLKB|5.0|I bought this DVD set for my girlfriend as a 2-year anniversary present because if it weren't for her insisting that we watch it on Tuesday nights when we first started dating there is likely no way I ever would have chosen to do so on my own.  Thanks, Tiger Blossom...you REALLY did me a favor with this one.<br />WOW, this is good...I probably haven't been this stoked over a TV drama series since &quot;Miami Vice&quot; back in the day.  And &quot;Smallville&quot; is already proving to have superior staying power than that brief cross-section of '80's kitsch.  Superior production, drop-dead casting, and a hearty respect to the original idea of Superman that you just didn't see in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;...but still they find time to wedge the tongue FIRMLY in cheek with foreshadowing innuendo that never fails to bring a smile to this viewer's face.  And this from a guy who leaned more toward Batman than the Big Blue Schoolboy as I was growing up (I had issues, okay?).<br />I won't go into the basics of the plot, chances are you already understand the adolescent Clark Kent growing into the blue suit &amp; red cape as he grows from boy to young man being equally awkward transitions to make.  The first season, being primarily an introduction not just to the characters but to the city for whom the series is named, DOES lend itself to predictability and in fact the quality of the shows has improved since then (no small feat; the first season was in itself extremely entertaining).  And true, the WB could possibly have been a tad more generous with special features (at LEAST offering a 5:1 sound mix option...the special effects would seem even larger than life over a home theatre system)...but I'll happily take what they've presented here and eagerly await the following seasons to be released (note to Warner Bros:  Tiger Blossom's birthday is on June 22nd...can ya help a brother out?)<br />Bottom line:  If you enjoy good television writing (which is SO rare these days), or if you EVER enjoyed any aspect of any of the innumerable interpretations of the Superman mythos, you owe it to yourself to give the show a chance.  Once you do, you'll find that owning the First Season on DVD is as natural as being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound., or if you EVER enjoyed any aspect of any of the innumerable interpretations of the Superman mythos, you owe it to yourself to give the show a chance.

B00005JMFR|4.0|Even though I found Matrix Reloaded a major disappointment, I still knew without doubt I would have to see Revolutions when it came out.  There was too much potential that just might yet be fulfilled, too many loose ends just begging to be tied.  While hardly a cinematic masterpiece, Revolutions is indeed a fulfilling climax to the Matrix series.  There are the usual bugaboos:  mediocre acting (except for the outstanding Hugo Weaving), a slew of rather unlikeable protagonists (I can't bring myself to like any of the characters except the big three of Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus) and an often ameaturish script, but one recurring problem with the Matrix--all the overblown psychobabble posing as philosophy--actually makes some sense this time around.  Some die-hard Matrix fans may be disappointed by the relative lack of action in this entry, but don't be fooled by a few negative reviews into thinking the Matrix has gone soft.  Revolutions packs some devastating punches, they're just more concentrated this time.  The robotic invasion of Zion is spectacular (if a bit unimaginative), Neo's encounter with a \\"real-world\\" Agent Smith is intense and provocative, and of course the ultimate showdown is a mindblowing exhibition that does NOT end as you'd expect.  As a Christian, by far the most powerful element for me in Revolutions is the strong Christ-imagery, which comes full circle in the moving finale.  Perhaps this is one turn-off for Matrix devotees who like to see the series as a repudiation of any orthodoxy.  Funny how so many \\"open-minded\\" people refuse to be at all open to any concept of an absolute truth.  Of course, Revolutions incorporates themes from several philosophies, but in the end it is the Christian element that shines most strongly.  In any event, there's something here for anyone who's come this far into the saga. As a slick package of modern spirituality, pop psychology, killer action, conspiracy theory, and high-octane FX, the Matrix Series is a winner that is ultimately more than the sum of its parts. And Revolutions is the story's climactic exclamation point.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Al Pacino was without a doubt a well-respected actor who had &quot;made his bones&quot; with any number of defining roles prior to his portrayal of Tony Montana in this Brian DePalma remake of the 1932 Howard Hawks &quot;Scarface&quot; based loosely on the life of Al Capone.  And in truth he's done some terrific work since, as well (&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, to name a few).<br />But this movie, thanks mainly to Pacino's merciless performance, has done more for pop culture than anything else he's ever been associated with.  That crazy over-the-top Marielito accent has been (badly) imitated more often among a generation of movie fans who weren't even out of diapers when &quot;Scarface&quot; was released back in 1983 than Marlon Brando's cotton-cheeked Don Corleone was mimicked since he came onto the scene in 1972; &quot;SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND&quot; has become the &quot;YOU TALKIN' TO ME?&quot; of the closing stages of the 20th Century.<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; practically invented the culture behind the hip-hop lifestyle, and this is brilliantly conveyed in the Def Jam featurette &quot;Origin of a Gangsta&quot; included on the second disc of this two-disc set, one of the most unique (and well-placed) special features ever to be included with a feature presentation; a director's commentary audio track would probably have been better appreciated, but the documentary footage included on the second disc mostly makes up for it.<br />The movie itself never looked better.  I never saw the previous DVD format, so I can't make a comparison, but it absolutely blows my old VHS tapes out of the water.  The 2.35:1 widescreen ratio is fantastic and all of Miami in its cocaine-addled '80's glory shines off the TV screen like a great big p****, just waitin' to get f*****...but I digress.  The sound is fantastic, and just when you think the movie has been dragging for too long, the last fifteen minutes exhilerates you to the point where you're ready to watch the whole thing all over again.<br />If this gangster movie isn't in a class by itself, it won't take long to call the roll.  If you EVER suspected that you might like gangster movies but want a different take on the genre than the NYC goombah angle, this is the flick for you.  And if you're a fan of Al Pacino...well, chances are you've already seen it at least five times...so what are you waiting for?

B0000399WI|5.0|When it was released, The Shawshank Redemption quickly faded out of the theater's and although it was considered for several Academy Awards, it was generally regarded as a bomb, a well-made bomb, but a bomb none-the-less.  But, when it was released on video, word-of-mouth and endless showings on cable began to spread the movie like wildfire, and like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, The Shawshank Redemption has become one of the most beloved films in recent memory.<br />The film starts out as a conventional prison drama: Andy Dufresne, a respected banker on the outside, is convicted of a crime he didn't commit and is sentenced to life in prison at a maximum security penitentiary.  From there, we see how Andy interacts in the harsh environment of prison, climbs his way up the ladder of pison politics and how an unlikely friendship develops between him, &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) and an assorted gang of convicted criminals.  Andy's indomitable spirit brings him through his trials while in prison and leads the film to an incredible conclusion that will have you jumping up and down and running around the room.  <br />What was initially billed as the film's greatest detriment, its length, actually turns out to be its greatest asset.  In an era of quick MTV-style editing and jump cuts, The Shawshank Redemption's deliberate pacing helps the audience truly bond with the characters and ultimately when the film's many strands come together for its conclusion, the emotional payoff is vastly more satisfying for the viewer. <br />The only significant problem with the film itself is the DVD that it has been packaged in.  If any film is screaming for a special edition DVD, it is certainly this one.  The &quot;extras&quot; are the trailer, production notes and some stills from the director.  Although the present packaging for the DVD is unacceptable for a film of its quality, I have hope that with the 10-year anniversary of the film's release just a year away, Castle Rock is hard at work rectifying the wrong that happened when this sub-par DVD was released.<br />With that small slight aside, I must conclude by saying that if you haven't seen this film yet, just get the DVD anyway!  The film is too good to keep yourself from viewing any longer!  Watch it today!
B00005JMFR|1.0|The Matrix Revolutions completes the downward spiral in originality and quality from the original. With an even worse script than Matrix Reloaded, which contains 99% cheese and GCSE level philosophical debates, which labour over the points to an unbearable level. Neo's affinity with the Saviour/Jesus identity is made so blatant as to lose any narrative power. Why turn an original first film into a family film so close to Star Wars that I think someone will be getting sued. I think they inlisted the help of the creator of Ja Ja Binks to create most of the characters for this film and subsequently have the same irritating effect on the film as a whole, I'm thinking Link and that kid who saves the day. Even the quality of Agent Smith, who just about saves the second film, is diminished to the extent of losing the edge that made him undoubtedly the most compelling of all the characters. The frustration of watching a good idea wasted is the main reason for not seeing this cheesy Star Wars rip off that sells out it's original idea to appeal to the widest majority of people.

Durning(Hudsucker) lep from the building of his own building(hilarious bit) and splats and then Paul Newman and others are  faced with a horrid truth, they have to have some lowlife run the company. Robbins(dipwitted at times) gets a BLUE LETTER and is sent up the stairs to see Newman who then Newman hired Robbins to run the company and all the longwile, Leigh(Archer) trys to undercover a big story. the Coen brothers are masters at what they do. Bruce Campbell adds some spark as well as one of Leigh's coworkers for the newspaper.
B000002KDO|5.0|Yes, Master Of Reality is the last great Sabbath release. It doesn't suffer from any cheese like Vol. 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and in my opinion is better than the later Dio material. The only Sabbath album that is better might be Paranoid, which contains the big radio hits but is also consistent all the way through. It also feels heavier due to the low production values that add a dense, sludgy feeling to the songs. Master Of Reality is produced more clearly, which is technically better but it oddly doesn't feel as weighty, even with the guitars detuned more than they were in Paranoid.<br />The technical differences aside, this album's material is right on par with Paranoid, and the band's already impressive skills were going up a notch. Guitarist Tony Iommi's riffs were deep, collosal, and full of groove, while the rhythm section of \\"Geezer\\" Butler (bass) and Bill Ward (drums) were very capable, especially Ward's tight and often eclectic percussion (listen to Children Of The Grave, especially in between the verses). Of course Ozzy Ozbourne was the only natural frontman for Black Sabbath, and he sounds great here.<br />Master Of Reality saw some welcome experimentation and expanded Sabbath's trademark sound. After Forever features keyboards, there are short acoustic songs in between the heavy tracks (Embryo, Orchid) and one song, Solitude, is done completely acoustic with Iommi on vocals (I think). It even features a flute. Still, it's the heavy stuff that the band excels at. Sweet Leaf opens the album with an echoing cough before plunging into the dark, with Ozzy praising marijuana. Next up is After Forever, which actually endorses Christianity and contains the lyric \\"God is the only way to love,\\" ironic since many conservatives continue to cite Black Sabbath as a \\"Satanic\\" band. Children Of The Grave and Lord Of This World are two solid heavy songs, and the closer Into The Void ends the album on a crusher of a riff and lyrics depicting escape into space from a destroyed world.<br />In short, anyone into metal should pick up this album. It ties with Paranoid as the best release the band made. You should also get Vol. 4, which is less consistent but contains several classic Sabbath cuts (including my favorite, Snowblind).om a destroyed world. <br />In short, anyone into metal should pick up this album.

B0000DYJM6|5.0|A must have. This CD shows us how Pearl Jam is still the number 1 band in the world. It has everything, it's nostalgic, energetic, full of feeling, great design, great sound, great songs.<BR>The album has 30 songs, some of which were already known, but there are at least 15 songs I've never heard before and I'm a PJ addict. The booklet has a brief history regarding the song (eg. why was the song left out of a certain album, where  did the band recorded it, or what happened in the world the day they recorded it) My favorite comment about a song is Ed talking about Last Kiss, he says \\"We have had a  lot of success with songs about dead teenagers\\"<BR>It is a very deep experience to listen to this album, my favorite is disc number 2, because is much more lighter than the first one, it has a lot of mellow and intense songs. The first one is a bit more \\"rocker\\". My favorite song is Fatal (track 1 in CD 2) Hope this is helpful. It is an unvaluable archive. You must get it.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's debut definitely turned more than a few heads back in 1969 with its hot, decadent electric blues-metal vibe. Led mostly by former Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page and blues wailer Robert Plant, the new band was remarkably ambitious and confident on its first outing, if a little raw and unfinished. Of course the blues purists hated it, but that didn't matter. There was potential here, something new.<br />But their sophomore album released later in 1969 during a busy touring schedule, simply named \\"II,\\" really got everybody talking. Led Zeppelin proved their power by releasing a real gem, an LP without a single dull moment or filler track. Led Zeppelin II has incomparable groove and flow. While it's not exactly a \\"song cycle\\" per se, moving one track out of its original running order somehow makes for a lesser experience. That's a testament to the excellence of this album. Is II excessive? Rude? Raunchy? Sure it is, but that's part of the charm.<br />At this point, the band was young and hungry, and everybody was at the top of their game in terms of playing. This would last only two more albums, and then disappear only to reappear once more on Physical Graffitti, the only Zeppelin album on the same plane as II (and it's a double LP). Plant's voice is incredible, Page's guitar buries riff after dirty riff into your gray matter, Bonham rips through his kit, and Jones backs it all with his sturdy bass playing.<br />Picking highlights on this disc is futile, as everything is delectable and memorable--the bowed guitar and raunchiness of Whole Lotta Love, the rainy-day blues of What Is And What Should Never Be, a thunderous reworking of blues standard \\"Killing Floor\\" (Hendrix also covered it) renamed The Lemon Song, the heartfelt ballad Thank You, the relentlessly down 'n' dirty riffage of Heartbreaker followed closely by the upbeat rocker Living Loving Maid, the Tolkien-inspired wanderer's ballad Ramble On, a showcase of Bonham's brilliant chops on Moby Dick, and Plant sounding like he just stepped off a Delta riverboat in Bring It On Home. Did I leave anything out?<br />Looking for a great blues-rock album? Start here. Led Zeppelin neophyte? Start here. Cross-country driving music? Start HERE. Just buy this if you haven't already. Also check out Physical Graffitti for similar brilliance in a double album.<br />Note: Regarding the plagiarism issue brought up with this album and Led Zeppelin I, only one blues performer has successfully sued the band--Willie Dixon for Whole Lotta Love (it was a remake of \\"You Need Love\\"). Although Page does borrow liberally from earlier blues artists, many famous music artists have borrowed styles and sound from previous generations of music. For example, where would Nirvana be without the Pixies, or the Rolling Stones without Bo Diddley? While Page should have been less stingy with assigning credit, it doesn't take away from what is a phenomenal album.Dick, and Plant sounding like he just stepped off a Delta riverboat in Bring It On Home.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|&quot;Train Of Thought&quot; sounds similar to their previous album &quot;Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence&quot; except it has a bit heavier riff. &quot;ToT&quot; isn't double CDed nor concept album, it pretty melancholy and dark. &quot;ToT&quot; has 7 tracks of songs including 1 instrumental song(Stream Of Consciousness). And song &quot;In The Name Of God&quot; give strong religious message. Interestingly, in the song &quot;This Dying Soul&quot;, they used exactly same riff of &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;fromtheir previous album, also they played riff of Metallica's &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; with their own lyrics, which is really suprised me. James tries several different vocalization on this album (e.g., rapping), specially on song &quot;Honor thy Father&quot;.

B00005OM4N|3.0|Previous albums led by an explosively catchy pop anthem: that was Britney's formula. Not this time. &quot;Britney&quot; is led off by the funk-drenched and delicious &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; (despite the insipid abbreviations in the title, can the Neptunes do no wrong?). Although Max Martin is still here in all his glory (the blah &quot;Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman&quot; and the chirpy and obnoxious &quot;Overprotected&quot;) Britney is signaling a move away from her soda-pop roots with the brash and fatally catchy &quot;Boys&quot; (and its corresponding &quot;Co-ed Remix,&quot; sadly not featured here), the offputting yet gleaming &quot;Anticipating&quot; and the sheer unbashfully cute and, yes, slightly stupid, lyrics of &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;; the strange choice of the sharp cover of &quot;I Love Rock and Roll.&quot; What remains to be seen, though, is if Spears can continue in this direction. Some of her attempts at rebellion and insight into her life come off as filler, and, although she contributes on a few of the tracks, her contributions (and skills, for that matter) could use some fleshing out. What she needs to do is to balance the mix between her funk, pop-rock, and yes, even R&amp;B ventures and leave the filler out. Maybe next time she'll have it right.

B0000013GT|5.0|Back in ¡¯94, Outkast penetrated with their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. People including me were like, ¡°who are these 2 guys with high-pitched voice and overly funky beats? They sound awesome!¡± And I thought it was too good, that like most of the rappers, Outkast wouldn¡¯t be able to keep their funk as pure as the first.<br />April of the year of 1996. I heard, don¡¯t remember how, that Outkast has released a new album. I drove to Best Buy and picked up the album and inserted it right in my car¡¯s CD player. The intro was weird, and it seemed that, like my expectations, they were not going to keep the funk going. Then it was Two Dope Boyz In A Cadillac. Wow, that was impressive. Boi¡¯s voice lowered a little which sounds better and so did Dre¡¯s. Next up, ATLiens. Heavy bass and catchy chorus, still impressive! Wheelz of Steel is where I cleared my mind and admitted to myself that this is even BETTER than Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. The atmosphere in general was much deeper and serious than SPCM (Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik). No doubt somebody didn¡¯t like it. It sounded completely different, but in my opinion, in a good way. When I got through 13th Floor, I knew that this album was my new favorite of all time. Deep bass lines, thoughtful lyrics, smoother flow than SPCM, less funky but more serious than SPCM, and comforting sound satisfied my ears than most anything. Now, in 2003, ATLien¡¯s my fourth favorite album (see my profile) of all time, and I play it on a daily basis. This album is a savior for my deep soul inside me. This, in my opinion, is the realest Outkast album to date, and the deepest atmosphere album of all time. I just LOVE it. I can¡¯t express my love of the album in words. Maybe these three words will do: GO GET IT.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I wasn't sure if they would be able to come close to their last CD, Six Degrees ..., but its not bad. There are the normal DT faire with the super fast solos, the sometimes over the top vocals, and the wonderfull drumming. Somethings are lacking. I miss a lot of the bass guitar work that was found on Six Degrees. JM is still keeping it going on the bass, he's just not as prominate as in the past. That was a dissappointment for me. Some of the guitar work has slid from the progressive more into a groove crunch thing. Which isn't bad, its just different. I'm not much for the keyboard side of DT, but seems like Rudess is doing his job and adding the musical layers that make DT great.<br />As for the songs ... well all of them have bright spots, but sometimes they seem to get a little lost along the way. I like the time changes and the progressive tendencies of their music, but it doesn't seem to flow as well in this record as in the past. Which that could be with all the DT fans being spoiled rotten by Six Degrees and how well that album flowed. Speaking of Six Degrees, yet again, if you liked Glass Prison it seems that This Dying Soul (track #2) could possibly be part 2. I haven't read the lyrics yet, but that monster riff towards the end of Glass Prison shows its self once again. You can look at that as either creative genious or lack of a fresh idea. I think it makes all of their works flow together. They did this on the last one too with the same white noise from the end of Met. part 2 flows to the beginning of Six Degrees. The songs on Train of Thought are mostly rockers. You do have the one slow number being Vacant, which is the only one that James penned the lyrics to by the way. The rest of the songs are done with all of the players writing the music and the lyrics are done by JP and MP except Vacant as mentioned above. Pretty much the way it was done on the last one.<br />You know you are going to have to buy this one if you are a DT fan, its hard not to. If you are wanting to start here with your DT collection I wouldn't suggested it. Go back to some of the earlier stuff and build up. Overall I like it. Can't wait to see what they end up doing on tour with this one.ou are wanting to start here with your DT collection I wouldn't suggested it. Go back to some of the earlier stuff and build up.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This incredible box set is, in my opinion, THE very reason that DVDs were created in the first place.  Getting the never-before-seen director's cut of all four alien movies is worth the $70 alone..  but toss in a jaw-dropping 40 hours of special features, and you have the greatest DVD collection ever released.<br />

B00009TB5G|5.0|This certainly isn't the movie J.R.R. Tolkien would have made, had he the opportunity to do so.  It also isn't the movie his family would have made - indeed, they are reportedly unhappy with Peter Jackson's rendering of their patriarch's work.<br />But it is a DARN GOOD MOVIE.  As a dedicated Tolkien fan, I left the theater angry (just as I had The Fellowship of the Ring).  In this movie, two extremely important scenes were left out, and one scene was changed so much I found it perverted.<br />The two scenes left out were: the breaking of Saruman's staff by Gandalf; and Shelob.<br />Gandalf breaking Saruman's staff, and the dialogue that transpired between the two, is some of the best writing in the book.  It's also of tremendous significance.  Gandalf *should* have been Saruman - meaning that Galadriel had wanted Gandalf to be the leader of the Istari, but Gandalf declined, not wanting any allegiances, nor did he wish to be beholden to anyone.  Coming back from the dead, after his epic struggle with the Balrog of Moria (and Balrogs, for those unfamiliar with some of the intricacies of Tolkien lore, are of the same race as Gandalf, Saruman, and Sauron -- the Maiar), he returned as Gandalf the White.  The completion of his return was symbolically dependent upon breaking Saruman's staff, and that didn't make the cut.<br />Many people complained (that is, many people who never read the books) that at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring really wasn't much of an end at all.  There was no cliffhanger, no real reason to come back to see the second movie.  Well, the scene with Shelob would certainly have fixed that problem in this film.<br />My mention of \\"perverted\\" referred to the treatment of Faramir.  I was considerably outraged that the entire nature of his character had been changed.  Instead of treating Frodo and Sam as equals, the Faramir of the film treated them like prisoners.<br />However, when all is said and done, I'm not a film maker.  This book was not an easy one to bring to the screen.  You can't just implant the images and words from the book onto the screen without considerable refinement.  In the books those images and words are astonishing, but on the silver screen who knows?  They may not have worked well at all.<br />Seeing the extended version of The Two Towers made me feel much better about the movie as a piece of the Lord of the Rings than the version released to the theater (I felt the same for Fellowship).<br />I can't wait...quite literally...for the extended version of The Return of the King.  It's been suggested that Gandalf's dealings with Saruman occur in there.  I hope so.  If that was left out entirely, I will be gravely disappointed.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah McLachlan is one of the musicians I've come to trust implicitly; I will buy one of her albums without reservation, without having to first listen to it.<br />While &quot;Afterglow&quot; isn't her best effort, it proves to me why I trust her so much. &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;Surfacing&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;The Freedom Sessions&quot; are all better and  stronger albums, but on &quot;Afterglow&quot; Sarah maintains a high level of musicianship and songwriting that still satisfies.<br />There aren't any tracks that really stand out more than the others.  The album's first single, &quot;Fallen&quot;, is actually one of the blander songs. However, a bland song for Sarah is better than ten Celine Dion or Kelly Clarkson pre-fab hits. And most of the songs on &quot;Afterglow&quot; are actually quite good.<br />&quot;Train Wreck&quot; is perhaps my favorite song on the album, a multilayered song that stands up to multiple listenings quite well. &quot;Stupid&quot; is a song for anyone who's questioned their own naivete in how they see a relationship (guilty as charged!), and &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; is about the lengths some will go to for love. McLachlan is not afraid to talk about difficult things in her songs, but she does it with grace and a gentle touch.<br />There is no question that Sarah McLachlan has a gorgeous voice, simply wonderful to listen to. That alone would (and does) sway me towards her, but what makes me want to listen is her storytelling voice, and her conistently excellent music. &quot;Afterglow,&quot; while not Sarah's best work, is certainly representative of the excellent and beautiful music she makes.<br />It may be 6 years since her last original album, but it's been worth the wait.
B000000OQF|2.0|Ill never figure out why people always rate this album as one of the greatest rock albums ever.When it came out ,Welcome to the jungle was catchy but thats about it. Its very overplayed on rock radio. Axl Rose is a no talent with the most annoying voice in many years. Ill never understand all the hype after all these years, thank god they broke up and Axls new version of GnR was a disaster.
B000002UAO|2.0|Popular poll results tend to rank all Beatle albums highly because of nostalgia and name recognition. Nevertheless, tracks like Michelle and In My Life are now most often heard in their orchestral, non-lyrical form, as background music; and songs like You Won't See Me are more likely to be heard in the Anne Murray cover version. <br />The fact is that Rubber Soul was a departure from the great beat and hooks of Beatlemania, as the band evolved to light pop.  Eventually they would return to their rock roots with the release of the White Album.  <br />Drive My Car and Harrison's If I Needed Someone Are Good.  But it's a 2-star album.

B00005JM0B|4.0|I think it's safe to say that the first two Terminator movies will go down as classic sci-fi/action films.  Not many directors can blend the kind of story and suspense that James Cameron did with those two movies.  <br />Taking over this time around is Johnathan Mostow, director of the WWII actioneer U-571.  Mostow proves here that he is more than up to the challenge to do the follow up to one of the most well-respected movie franchises out there.  He has a grasp of the story and controls the pace very well and even though there are some pretty lame moments, they are all well-compensated for with some pretty dandy action sequences and excellent visual effects.  Mostow continues to show his knack for directing action movie and I look forward to seeing more from him.<br />While incredibly silly at times (this entry in the series is decidely lighter than the first two and even boarders on being a comedy), we are treated to a clever way to continue on a series that seemingly died out long ago.  The robots are still trying to kill John Connor, but this time, they send a woman back for whatever reason.  Kristanna Loken does a fair job of bringing this character to life as she is the counter to Mr. Governor.  Arnold once again proves he has a limited acting range with this outing, but since the T-101 is a limited character, it all fits.  I still have trouble believing that the female terminator is stronger and smarter.  Well, not necessarily smarter, but you get the idea.<br />With some obvious flaws (a sub-par performance by Nick Stahl as John Connor comes to mind), Terminator is still a highly enjoyable film with great action scenes and of course, more Terminator than you can shake a stick at.  It all fits mysteriously enough to make a film that stands alone well, but really can't hold a candle to its predecesors.  And get this: Terminator 4 is supposed to go Arnold-less.  You can be the judge of that part.<br />The video quality on this DVD is nothing short of excellent.  Colors are striking, black-level is perfect, CGI blends well and doesn't look overly apparent.  No artifacting issues and edge enhancement is next to nill.  Fine detail is excellent and provides for an overall three-dimensional appearance.  The overall look to this film is less harsh than of the first two Terminators and it shows here.  Colors are not nearly as blue-looking as they were in the first films and the overall palette is wider and provides for an excellent treat for the eyes.<br />As good as the transfer is, the audio here knocks it completely out of the park.  This is easily the best-sounding DVD of the year so far and will likely go down as one of the best-sounding discs in history.  The mix is really open with a wide dynamic range with excellent mid-range and ear-shattering highs that never get to the point of overbearing.  The bass here will knock you out of the room.  I felt my pant-leg shake more than once.  The chase scene with the firetruck is great demo material as chaos surrounds you, debris flies past your head, and explosions kick you in the gut.  This mix is just too good for words.<br />The commentary tracks here are pretty good (featuring Mostow, Arnold, Stahl, Loken, and co-star Claire Danes), but most of the material on the second disc just seems like it's trying to promote itself rather than giving an insight into the actual film-making process.  While not bad, it just could have been much better.<br />Love it, like it, or hate it, Terminator 3 will get you going.  It looks and sounds awesome, but the extras could stand to have been a little better.  A highly recommended buy just as another demo disc alone.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Look, I don't know about the rest of you, but when I read, and re-read these books (and others) growing up, I would always imagine it in my head. As I read the text, I created a little movie in my head about what the characters looked like, how they acted, the scenery, the mannerisms, and everything about them.<BR>Now, usually, when a book is turned into a movie, it's horrible. It crushes my \\"mind movie\\" and I have to make allowances for the director's \\"Interpretation.\\"<BR>The beauty and genius of this series, is, I have seen my mind unfold on screen. Peter Jackson et all has made my imagination become a reality. These movies are made SO CLOSE to what I imagined, frankly, it's a little scary! And, through the magic of DVD, we are able to see the Uncut versions of the movie. Directors always have to allow for \\"economics\\" and annoying people that don't want to sit through long movies. So, you end up with a chopped up piece of a movie. With these, you get to see it the way the DIRECTOR intended it. And in this case, the director is an absolute genius. I want this man to re-create ALL future movies for me. There simply has never been, and until VR is better, probably never WILL BE a better adaptation from the books. I am in awe of this team, and grateful that they made my childhood fantasies a very stunning reality.
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and it's hard for anyone to argue that their musical talents don't match up with the best of them in the modern scene (U2, Radiohead).  While not quite at classic status, they certainly have the potential and this live concert DVD is a pretty good package.<br />Unfortunately, there is one major quibble I have with the actual concert footage: it's very poorly edited.  Some of you may remember that Dave Matthews concert that came out last year (from Boulder, Colorado, I believe).  The editing is extremely &quot;herky jerky,&quot; not focusing on one band member for more than a second in most cases.  I found this &quot;technique&quot; to be very distracting in some cases, especially when I felt like watching any particular band member.  This kind of detracted from the overall experience.<br />On the plus side, Coldplay puts on an awesome show and the music itself is really good, so it works out for the best.  You'd be hard-pressed not to at least enjoy the aural experience this DVD provides.  So if you're at least a casual fan of Coldplay, then don't hesitate to pick up this DVD for the music itself.<br />The picture quality is pretty good.  It's anamorphic widescreen, which is always a plus.  And unlike most concert DVD's, it's shot on film, so the image is actually a lot better than what it could have been.  There are a couple of scenes where there appears to be a bit much grain or certain colors seem overly bright, but for the most part, it's a solid transfer.  Not a whole lot of edge enhancement and compression problems are thankfully next to nothing.  Looks pretty spiffy for a concert film.<br />The audio is the true star here.  Presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS ES Matrixed surround sound, this mix is just right.  It's not overly loud, which is really a good thing.  The spaciousness and overall presence in this mix can only be described as pleasant, as Coldplay's melodies eminate from all around you.  Usually concert mixesare too front-heavy, but this one is balanced out quite nicely.  As expected, the DTS mix is a bit more open-sounding with tighter bass.  But either one is a treat.  Good show!<br />Whether you are a casual fan of the band or a die-hard fanatic, then you'll love this DVD.  It's one you'll watch quite often, and with a solid transfer and great Dolby and DTS mixes, this disc will make its way to the top of your favorites.
B00005JMFI|5.0|This movie has all that is needed to truly enjoy a family night at the movies! Although, I would recommend it for girls night out, and couples too. ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS! Easy to follow, funny, nice moral to the story ending that the kids can grasp without explanation. I can't decide who enjoyed it more, my husband and I or our 3 kids!!! Can't wait for the DVD and soundtrack releases, must haves for the Holiday season. THANKS Jon Favreau!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|In an ongoing effort to amaze me, Pearl Jam has released a two disc set of 30 songs that come from the past years of my favorite band...songs from the Ten sessions, from VS., from No Code, Yield, Binaural, Riot Act, benefit cds, soundtracks, they're all here and I haven't even heard some of them before.  The old songs are so amazing, it's like the first time you heard Ten or VS., you just sit, smile and cast your mind back to the first day you found out, that this band was &quot;it&quot;.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I have to say that this soundtrack is as delightful as the movie itself.  Both add a much needed touch of warmth to these colder months.  Highlights of the cd include the classic Joni Mitchell, Otis Redding, Maroon 5 (a surprise as I have only heard one song of theirs before), and Kelly Clarkson.  Her song, &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot; takes the listener back to the sounds of Aretha Franklin and Donny Hathaway.  Her soulful voice is undeniable and can warm any heart.  This CD is a must buy!
B0000CFW87|4.0|I'd give this album 4.5 stars because it is good.  After all, given his tender years (as far as classical singers are concerned), Josh Groban has amazing control over his rich baritone and can infuse the music with what seems to be a lifetime experience of poignant longing and heartbreak.  <br />As a French speaker, I was particularly impressed with his interpretation (and diction) on l'Hymne a l'Amour, one of my fave French lovesongs.  However,although I love Italian pop, I just wish there was less of it on this album.  It's a personal bias, but I'd rather hear Italian pop from Italian singers like Zucchero, Andrea Bocelli and Eros Ramazotti, who've been doing it a lot longer than Groban.  And the song &quot;Oceana&quot; wasn't enough of an attention grabber to be first on the CD.  Another thing to note is that unlike his last album, I don't see any songs that would obviously be a hit single.  &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; is a great song, or could've been truly great if the songwriter saw fit to write more lyrics.  The majority of the song is made of the chorus, sung at various octaves and includes a gospel choir.  Almost as if the writer suddenly lost inspiration to write a second verse and tried to cover up his writer's block with Josh's musicianship in the hopes that nobody would notice.<br />I felt that the last song done in collaboration with Deep Forest could have been more gutsy.  I'm familiar with Deep Forest in the World Music scene and the song has an interesting sound, at the beginning, but in effort to not freak out Groban's mainstream, pop-classical audience, the envelope wasn't pushed enough and the result was good but unmemorable finale to an overall low-key album.  Groban's &quot;Closer&quot; is a worthwhile purchase if you're already a fan of his, but it doesn't surpass the freshness of his first release.
B00004S6GL|5.0|I've been a casual Elliott Smith fan for almost 2 years, but until recently had only listened to &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; &amp; &quot;XO&quot;.  Upon hearing of his passing I immediately ordered &quot;Either/Or&quot; and &quot;Figure 8&quot;.  Now, &quot;Either/Or&quot; is a terrific album, but unfortunately I've only listened to it twice.  That is because &quot;Figure 8&quot; has been the only thing I want to hear for the last 10 days.<br />If you're wary of buying this album because of what you've heard about the &quot;more produced sound&quot;, etc., get over it.  More production is only a problem when it attempts to mask uninspired songwriting.  Not the case here.  On the contrary, access to a higher budget has allowed Elliott to open up his songwriting.  The simple, beautiful structures are still there in full force, only now they have been fleshed-out and layered with lush instrumentation and harmonies.  There's more creative inspiration in one song here than in most artists' entire repertoires.  And while several songs stand out to me as masterpieces (Son of Sam, Stupidity Tries, Happiness, Can't Make a Sound), you really aren't tempted to just play the highlights, since the entire album is delicious.<br />I'm anxiously anticipating the release of Elliott's unfinished album.  But in the meantime, &quot;Figure 8&quot; will do just fine.  I haven't fallen this much in love with an album in at least 10 years.
B000002I6X|4.0|Sandwiched between his classic 1970 solo LP 'Stephen Stills', and his seminal work with Manassas, we have this noteworthy second solo album from 1971.  This production features 9 1/2 great compositions.  Yet one gets the feeling that Stephen found himself a few noodles short of a casserole while cooking this up, and thought better about putting out another effort until he had a full plate in front of him... and he certainly had a four-course dinner prepared when he pulled the epic double-LP 'Manassas' out of the oven in 1973.<br />In some ways, who plays the music on this collection is nearly as noteworthy as the performances themselves.  While the liner notes lack specifics, Eric Clapton reprises his contribution to Stills first solo LP (somewhere), and Nils Lofgren adds guitar and keyboards as well (somewhere).  David Crosby and photographer Henry Diltz supply vocals, and the seeds of heir apparent 'Manassas' are present in the likes of Paul Harris on keyboards, Calvin \\"Fuzzy\\" Samuels on bass, and Dallas Taylor on drums.  Even Billy Preston is credited with an appearance (somewhere).<br />Though hit and miss, the songs feature superstars as well. Fans of Stephen Stills would be remiss to overlook the jagged rock of 'Relaxing Town', the lush resonance and booming chorus of 'Change Partners', the engaging, entreating lyrics of 'Sugar Babe', Still's falsetto impression of Frankie Valli on 'Marianne' (as 'pop' as Stephen ever got...), and the folk acoustic parade of 'Word Game', 'Know You Got To Run', and 'Singin' Call'.  Add to this 'Fishes and Scorpions', Stills indictment of astrology (is that Eric's lead?), and Stephen's ode to slackers everywhere, 'Nothin' To Do But Today', which features the most appealling guitar hook on the album, and you have the core of a first class, five star album.  But for the most part it dries up at this point.<br />The remaining songs, 'Open Secret', 'Bluebird Revisited', and especially 'Ecology Song' are lesser fare. I will give halfcredit for 'Bluebird', a standout Buffalo Springfield composition (and Stephen deserves an \\"A\\" for effort in his ambition to revisit the song, and for the delectable lead guitar solo that finishes it off), but the brassy orchestrations don't suit the number well, which featured classic acoutic and electric guitars, and concluded with banjo accompaniment in its original incarnation.  Unlike the genius which spawned the adaptation of 'Questions' to 'Carry On' on the 1970 'Deja Vu' LP, this retrospective needs to be stripped down, ala 'Bluebird-Naked'.  The piano and conga interplay at the end of 'Open Secret' nearly persuades me to offer it a half credit as well... but not quite.  We all have to draw the line somewhere. <br />Nonetheless, Stills recognized that this collection possessed enough diversity to make a college administrator blush.  The music is segmented among acoustic folk, electric rock, keyboard-centered ballads, and heavily orchestrated compositions.  Rather than gathering the numbers by type, Stills takes a salad bowl approach by mixing the various taste sensations.  On the original vinyl release, each side of the album possessed at least one song of each type.  At times Stills creates stunning juxtapositions, such as following up the wide open 'Relaxing Town' with the subtle confines of 'Singin Call'.  Unfortunately, this approach may cause listeners to wonder how it all fits together, as it seems to take you in no particular direction.  Stills' follow up to '2', the much heralded 'Manassas', seemed to directly address this absence of continuity. <br />So if you got nothin' better to do but today, you could do a lot worse, but also better, than this particular Stills collection. However, no self-respecting fan of Stephen Stills would be caught without it.
0800128052|5.0|I'm not a big sports movie fan, but Rudy is altogether different than other movies.<BR>Sean Astin is perfectly cast as the determined, yet undersized, Dan &quot;Rudy&quot; Reutiger, in this inspiring true tale.  Always up against the odds as the runt little brother of a Notre Dame football loving family, he dreams to be a member of the renowned football team.  Through hard drive and detemination, he is able to achieve that dream, but not without further kinks, such as being accepted to the school as a student, and actually being brought up from the prep team to the actual play roster.<BR>I laughed and cried, sometimes both at the same time, throughout the movie, cheering and hoping to see his one dream come true.  The supporting characters played by Jon Favreau (as D-Bob), Ned Beatty (as the senior Mr. Reutiger) were both great as the supporter (Favreau) and the stonewaller (Beatty).  The actor playing Rudy's older brother Frank was perfect as the total jerk, but on the other hand you couldn't help but feel somewhat sympathetic towards him, knowing that he will never aspire to such dreams or have the drive to achieve them.<BR>I would recommend this to anyone who is also a dreamer and does not mind laughing a little and shedding a few tears.  Long live &quot;Rudy&quot; Reutiger!!!
B00002MZ12|5.0|alanis can REALLY REALLY sing. u can't argue with that after u listen to this album.  my mom thought alanis as a &quot;hanus b*tch&quot; (cuz of jagged little pill) lol. but when i bought this cd, (expecting it would be hard rock and screaming) my mom even liked it! haha.  it's wonderful! sure she doesnt scream and sound angry and angsty. but MAN can she sing! let alone play guitar, harmonica, and the flute! she's very talented. and i read someone saying &quot;No Pressure...&quot; is meaningless....uh hullo? where in this world are u?? this song is my FAVORITE song. and it's QUITE sad...it talks about her brother, who i'm expecting is mentally ill, and this song just talks about how she loves him and how she is with him, and it makes me cry cuz its so good....it reminds me of my sister.  but anyways.  this cd is AWESOME. even for u non alanis fans (whats wrong with u!)  this cd is a completely different experience.
6303168507|5.0|I have only seen this on the big screen so I am not sure how it looks on video.  The use of black and white was sheer genious and the times color was used was the most effective since The Wizard of Oz.  I am not a huge Liam Neelson fan but his performance in this film was huge.  The film is the closest I have seen to capturing the horror of the holocaust while still having the characters appear very human.
B000002MY3|5.0|this is the best chick muzik i've ever herd.  better than avril lavigne,  or michelle branch. &quot;jagged little pill&quot; tops it ALL.  (with some exceptions) and the song 'Mary-jane' is NOT about one of her friends!!! duhhh. how dence can u get?? it's OBVIOUS she's talking about smokin' it up!! LOOK AT THE TITLE!!  (some ppl's kids)   but ya. even though she yells/and screams, and sounds much MUCH better live, i REALLY do love this cd. it's like a therapy cd for me :D lol.  also check out her MTV unplugged cd if u wanna hear her sing AWESOMELY. i also like the bonus track at the end of the You Oughta Know remake.  it also shows off her singing capabilities....but what's the difference between the track 2 of You Oughta Know and the one at the end?? i still can't find a difference!! (besides at the end of the last one if u wait there's the bonus track) but anyways. ROCK ON alanis! this cd kicks @$$
630157401X|4.0|This movie is far superior to The Temple of Doom but falls far short of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Sean Connery is wonderful as Indy's father and it appeared that the makers of this film tried to repackage what they could from the first film.  The Nazis are back as the villians and this time instead of the Ark of the Covennant, Indy is after another religious relic; The Holy Grail.  (Funny but I remember Monty Python looking for the same thing).
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|I hear no growth whatsoever, but its so damn catchy. Room on Fire is basically the same album they wrote two years ago. Don't  get me wrong,i would much rather listen to this than Hansen or Train. The STrokes are obviously fully aware that they have a unique sound, and have it perfected, as we hear on Room On Fire. BUT where are the acoustic sounds, the harmonies, clear vocals, a slow song, a harmonica? a touch of something different, and don't say 12:51 and The End is the End sounds different, cus one guitar lick doesn't define an entire sound or give anyone the right to say the Strokes have grown.  My point is that the Strokes have so much potential, but have seemed to make a SAFETY album here. I saw them recently in Missasauga, and it was BORING (they're not an arena rock band YET). I actually ran into them they next day on the street but had nothing good to say to them so i bought a Vancouver Canucks shirt instead. I felt much better then.<BR>The songs are all catchy and have a life of their own, but honestly they sound WAAAAAAY to much alike. I'm a fan of the music and this album, BUT i hope they do something different in the future.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Breathtaking... you want your ears to listen to real True music... 90% of the artist past/present/future could only dream they could create art of that which is Dream Theater.  This is a piece of art work, from the book cover to the imagery to the words/text to the voice to the sounds coming from the most talented band there is.  This album from the beginning to the end is simply beautiful.  More people have to give respect and recognition to this band, who knows how long they will be around so we need to enjoy there briliancy and should feel privledged to get a chance to listen to what they create.  They have gotten better with each of there albums...<br />As I am: One hell of a haunting yet eligent riff that would make Pantera aplaud... wonderful chorus... overall an impressive single that should be played on the air waves!!! 9/10  (only 9 because i still cant get over the very friendly radio feel(unlike DD, which can be looked at as a good or bad thing, remember they love to keep you on your toes) of the song... still unbelivable though<br />This Dying Soul:  heavy, quick, dark, emotional yet still beautiful key to what makes Dream Theater unique, you never want any of there songs to end, and its saying alot since they go with an untraditional state of length at times in there songs...I would say this is the heaviest track on the album and built around History and pasion of music, with the implications of other bands, i would too agree that its much like something you would hear from metallica 10/10<br />Endless Sacrifice:  My fav track on the album, true the riff has a more nu - metal feel to it, but come on its still amazing and im sry but nothing from this album can be considered anything nu - metal that is a rediculous statment the gender of nu - metal is a discrace to music... this is my fav track because of its transition from gentle to hard and its overall implications that this band can take the structure of anything in this case make even Nu-Metal sound not just good but brilliant.. wonderful album on every level.. 11/10 ( 11 for making a mockery out of nu-metal and showing how to do it!)<br />Honor Thy Father:  Scary, actualy haunting, very dark, twisted, heavy/fast, most powerful track on the album all i can say about this track is that, it brings another question, outside of (Dimebag &amp; Rex from Pantera) can any pair of guitar and basses work as good together as these two?  Wow, the riffs that they create through blending/twisting/entwining together is unstopable... again one thing to note true there are again a few implications of what some could consider nu - metal traits... but yet again i must implicate that thouse who say that one dont understand music, and two do not understand DD they love doing new things... they try everything, what have they not tried to do... and there music speaks for it selve in saying that they can do just about anything right.  They love to push themselves they are a progressive band... keep this in mind even through this album, true this is on the boudarie of being a metal album, but its still a progressive album, its still DD being them 10/10 (just alone the work that they create together says it all)<br />Vacant:  I can not even imagine how to comment on this track... 15/10 extra points for the risk, choosing to put such a beautiful/elegant soft/gentle piece along with the rest of this album... showing that clasical music will never die.  My hats off to this track... whats most impressive is that my heart tightens and beats just a little tigher and faster, one the lightest track on the album!! sheer beautiy... the gods are looking down on them on this track<br />Stream Of Consciousness:  I love the title... in many ways u could say that this title belongs to every one of Dream Theaters songs... when you listen to this track, along with any of there tracks ever.. it really has a feeling of a Stream Of Consciousness, yet another wonderful trait of Dream Theater... i would however if i have a fav, i have to have a least fav, and i t would be this track.. the bizare thing its not a bad thing, the only reason why i put it as my least fav, is because every time i listen to the track, i get lost in it, and i never remember listening to it.. so even though its my least fav, i still have to give it a 10/10 because its so good u get lost in its beauty ... the only turn off is that theres no specific special key notes in the track. so they offset eachother making it a 10<br />To The Name Of God:  9/10 for only one reason, before buying this album i read some reviews from onthers on this site... and they all sayed that the ending to this track is specatcular.. and now im not saying its not there, and that the ending is bad.. not at all all im saying is that what you didnt think that this band had it in them, i mean what ending are u talking about?  John has pulled thouse amazing quick guitar solo's before.. nothing new.. and the kind of almost opera feel to the very end again is something they have done before.. each time they have they have been good at it... so my point is that i am listening to it waiting for this suposingly extra spectacular new phase, and it never happend, all i heard was Dream Theater being the briliant Dream Theaterwever if i have a fav, i have to have a least fav, and i t would be this track.. the bizare thing its not a bad thing, the only reason why i put it as my least fav, is because every time i listen to the track, i get lost in it, and i never remember listening to it.. so even though its my least fav, i still have to give it a 10/10 because its so good u get lost in its beauty ... the only turn off is that theres no specific special key notes in the track. so they offset eachother making it a 10<br />To The Name Of God:  9/10 for only one reason, before buying this album i read some reviews from onthers on this site... and they all sayed that the ending to this track is specatcular.. and now im not saying its not there, and that the ending is bad.. not at all all im saying is that what you didnt think that this band had it in them, i mean what ending are u talking about?

B0000CD5I6|4.0|If memory serves, Jethro Tull had hinted at releasing a Christmas album as early as the time of the release of the Living In the Past album.  That album's &quot;A Christmas Song&quot; was a delicious hint at what might have been in store for fans; the subsequent release of several yuletide tunes on the 20 Years of Jethro Tull compilation was a further indication of what might have been expected on said Christmas album.  Now, finally, it has arrived!<BR>The tunes are modern realizations and re-recordings of many now-familiar Tull holiday confections as well as tasteful instrumentals and songs in the vein of Ian Anderson's recent solo work.  There are strings attached, as in orchestral strings, to tunes such as &quot;Pavane&quot;, &quot;First Snow on Brooklyn&quot;, and others.  Ian Anderson's flute rarely takes on a harsh tone, but the typical Tull signature changes are still present. <BR>Though Anderson's singing lacks the spirit and energy of his younger days, the good news is that it seems to have regained its mellifluous quality. This is very apparent on the re-do of &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot;; a milder, less raucous arrangement than was found on Songs From the Wood.  <BR>The re-do of &quot;Boure&quot; was fun to hear but really added nothing of substance to the original.  I know, so what?<BR>The instrumentals &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Greensleeved&quot;, and &quot;We Five Kings&quot; give us overly familiar melodies wrapped in soft jazzy background music arrangements. &quot;Holly Herald&quot; has a jaunty and spirited folklike rhythm. &quot;Pavane&quot; is highly derivative of Faure's piece of the same name.  The concluding instrumental &quot;A Winter Snowscape&quot; gives us a cloying non-descript melody wrapped in the same relaxed livingroom arrangement--a disappointing closer, actually.<BR>I really enjoyed &quot;Birthday Card at Christmas&quot;, &quot;Last Man at the Party&quot;, and the re-recordings of &quot;A Christmas Song&quot; and &quot;Weathercock&quot;.  The re-do of &quot;Another Christmas Song&quot; adds nothing to the original found on Rock Island where it seemed out of place; it's a fine tune nonetheless.<BR>Grownups everywhere will not be offended by this album, and older fans such as this writer will take pleasure in hearing these tasty holiday offerings.  I'm not certain what younger listeners will take away from this, however. Perhaps it's for the best that Ian and the boys stick to appealing to their core graying audience.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron continue to cement themselves as great modern film stars in &quot;The Italian Job,&quot; and are ably supported by a quality cast -- including Seth Green's best non-Buffy role to date -- in this remake.<br />Like all great caper flicks, the film puts an emphasis on cleverness, and the tricks and twists are all top-notch, with even the signature use of the new Mini Coopers being both incredibly plausible and, yes, very clever. When things go wrong, they go wrong because of human fallibility and bad luck, instead of cumbersome and artifical plot complications.<br />With the surprising exception of Donald Sutherland, the cast all are at the top of their respective games in this, and ego-driven scenery chewing is almost entirely absent, and even the hints of romance are nicely underplayed, taking a logical second place to the revenge-driven caper itself.<br />The film rates only 4 stars due to direction that sometimes fails to keep the film as tense and taught as it perhaps ought to, but it still ranks as one of the smartest and most charming action/adventure movies in years.<br />Strongly recommended for fans of &quot;The Sting,&quot; &quot;Ocean's 11&quot; and fans of Seth Green.
B00000K19E|5.0|This film is simply perfect!<BR>I think everyone can find in it something he likes: some the philosiphical aspects, some the action, some (girls) just Neo. I think it's the best film I've ever seen, much better than its two sequels.
B00005JL96|5.0|Perhaps the Disney film least like the Disney formula released in decades, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; looks and feels like a high quality release from some upstart animation company.<br />Moving across a water-colored Hawaiian backdrop -- but eschewing the overblown glossy and even insulting way &quot;Pocahantas&quot; portrayed the relationship between native peoples and their environment -- Lilo and Stitch are perhaps the least-cuddly Disney characters ever, and thus, likely the most realistic. Lilo is something of a monstrous little girl, of the sort recognizable on every playground but seldom seen in movies (and certainly not in G-rated movies). Her acting out has reason, but understanding it doesn't magically excuse it or resolve her misbehavior. She's also distinctly not picture-perfect: She's round, not particularly attractive, and even her comparitively willowy older sister has real world hips and a non-ideal figure. It's a refreshing change from the ordinary Disney film, where we're told the proto-supermodel characters are just ordinary girls, despite their beauty, brilliance and perfect behavior. Girls of all ages will recognize themselves in Lilo and Nani.<br />Which isn't to say the characters don't have sympathetic traits: Stitch's scene recreating &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; is one of the most heart-breaking scenes in animated film history -- it would take being a real alien monster not to feel a twinge and a damp eye.<br />In a break from Disney animated films, we don't get new songs written for the film. Rather, Lilo's love of Elvis Presley -- on LPs, at that -- forms the soundtrack for the film. It's a gamble that works wonderfully and probably will serve as the introduction for new generations to the works of Elvis.<br />Eschewing the dramatic life changes that are so standard in Disney films, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; wraps up with a single important lesson: Family is something you define for yourself. It's a believable and important lesson that is nicely understated in the finale.<br />Strongly recommended to audiences of all ages, particularly older fans who feel that Disney films have tended to blur together in recent years. &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; is different, with a fresh voice and rough edges. A diamond wonderfully in the rough.n that is nicely understated in the finale.<br />Strongly recommended to audiences of all ages, particularly older fans who feel that Disney films have tended to blur together in recent years. &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; is different, with a fresh voice and rough edges.

B000003S0D|4.0|Any review of a Crimsoid album begins with the assumption of greatness, that is 5 stars, because they are simply the best, most intelligent and literate existing rock band ever.  They've always had the greatest musical talent, as well as artistic originality, creativity and integrity.  Their mission, through myriad incarnations, has always been to serve this elusive yet thunderous, wondrous musical diety that has always been a sum almost supernaturally beyond its participants.  This includes CEO and high priest and chief strategist Fripp.  They are the Beatles or Talking Heads with musical talent.  They are Yes or ELP with a relentless artistic foundation.<BR>     \\"Lizard\\" almost earns 3 stars for two major detractions.  Gordon Haskell, as a vocalist, falls far short in the Crimsoid ouvre of persistent musical talent.  There's just no getting accustomed to his voice because it lacks listenability.  Word is that Bryan Ferry auditioned for this version of Crimson.  Oh! if that had not fallen through for whatever reason!  Haskell, as a singer (his bass work seems fine) just \\"doesn't have the tonal quality to make it consistently interesting,\\" to quote an old Harry Chapin song.  <BR>     The other negative on this album is the track \\"Happy Family.\\" Many of these tracks meander with aspirations of great jazz and classical music.  However, the complex migrations between composition and improvisation, so captivating everywhere else, fails on this little do nothing piece of grating music.  I guess there's some irony that Sinfield's most accessible Crimson lyrics to date(being a ballad about the conflicts resulting in the break up of the Beatles, names changed to protect the innocent) should be applied to such a mish mash, pointless song that nearly offends with its discordant and unsophisticated melody, but the joke wears thin wicked fast.<BR>     Thank God for programmable CD players, because once we give this guy the boot, we are left with a dramatic masterful suite of songs that are somewhere between ballads and avant garde opera; prog \\"rock\\" (barely) pushed to its extreme yet at one of its finest moments.  It is impossible to dance to, it utterly demands your attention, it alternately frightens, soothes, fascinates, or fills one with melancholy, often enough within the same tracks.  Words cannot do honor to this phantsmagorical lyrical and aural experience.  It is literate and challenging.<BR>        It is further redeemed (thus the 4 stars) because the instrumental (pun intended) \\"Bolero\\" section of the title suite is, on top of all this bombastic praise, one of the most sublime 6 minutes of music you shall ever hear.  In a long and replendent career, this one piece represents Crimson's finest effort.  Though loose and meandering, but nonetheless poignant, it is the prototype of so much great improvisational music to come.  And, it is strickingly fresh, laden with brass and piano threaded throughout with a high oboe solo that will shatter the hardest hearts.  It is without the heavy metal proclivity or digitalized, mannered technique of the current incarnation.  Consume it and be subsumed!
B00005JKDR|4.0|While the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies had a fairly simple story, as did &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; marks real progress for Pixar. While one expects greater technical sophistication with each film (and said expectations are always rewarded), this film also marks the first time where shades of gray creep into the story, and new heights in creativity in the setting, characters and storyline are added to the mix.<br />The three Pixar films prior to this are mostly kids' stuff, with the fun for adults being the gee whiz technical aspects (and seeing long-ago toys come to life), &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; slyly plays with adult conventions, making it a delight for audiences of all ages.<br />For younger viewers, the film may run a little long, but it's still time well-spent. The added features on the DVD are excellent as well, but are arranged in a more kid-friendly format than adult viewers might prefer, although not to the ridiculous extent present on the first Harry Potter DVD.<br />Recommended for film fans of all ages, including adults who worry that Pixar is already starting to rest on their considerable laurels.
B0000CFW87|5.0|The wait for this album is now over.  Now the music rolls on from the debut album - Josh Groban...and the teaser Live album, where we first heard Broken Vow.  <br />Broken Vow is heard here in CLOSER .... beautiful arrangement.  This studio version is more intimate than the live version and  takes us into the betrayal of this relationship.<br />Amongst the songs collected here, You Raise Me Up is truly outstanding.  A cover of Secret Garden's gem.  The opening, similarly, with Uilleann pipes sets the mood of the Irish Famine as pictured with the stirring lyric.  Josh and team have done an exquisite take, made it quite his own.  And I still love Secret Garden's version....<br />Paul Schwartz and David Foster's ALL'IMPROVVISO AMORE is another brilliant track.  Punchy as the choppy sea...fluid as Josh's voice.  I'm so impressed.<br />Joshua Bell's opening in MI MANCHERAI from il postino is typical of his standard - brilliant.  Josh's voice flows into the song and again, fills it with poetry.  More than I can say for Deborah Harry's version in English.  As much as I love Deborah, her set of English lyric did nothing for the melody, which is recorded for the Cinema Italiano album.<br />Never Let Go is somewhat disappointing; a rather so-so track with Eric Mouquet.  The voice does not sit into the song, or is it the other way, I cannot say.<br />Remember When It Rained with Eric Mouquet is so much better.  Add the words, written by Josh and the song is very attractive.  The arrangement sets the moody tone of rain and tears... <br />And there's something for everyone: a spanish track, a french one, throw in Lucio Dalla's Caruso and you get, all together, a very very impressive album from this young man.<br />Production-wise, this album is very good; vocals still warm and earthy.<br />Josh's voice has grown and the maturity shines through with smoothness and grace.  Great album.  Keep enjoying your work Josh and keep performing..<br />Thanks for the music.
0805062971|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but am trying to read more and watch TV less. I started reading Fight Club and immediately fell in love with it. This book is not for the faint of heart as is mentioned in other reviews. If this book had a rating it would be an R. It describes way to make homemade napalm and explosives in just the first chapter. Made me feel as if I were reading a novel version of the Anarchist's Cookbook. The writing is dark, funny, witty, and nihilistic all the same time. The book is mostly told in a narrative style by the main character, which oddly enough is never named. The main character is very tormented and confused about his place in life and is fed up with having things too easy and too perfect. He welcomes disposing of all this possessions and starting on a path of anarchy and destruction. Tyler is his influence for all this destruction and anarchy, he is the ringleader. He is the one with all the knowledge of destruction and interesting recipes for homemade explosions, napalm, and soap.

B0000CFW87|5.0|Some of the best vocal recording work I have ever heard (if not the best).  David Foster is truly a genius and the rest of the cast behind this album reads like a musical dream team (Walter Afanasieff, etc.).  After hearing the production perfection from start to finish on this album, it makes other albums seem like they were thrown together by grade schoolers.<br />As far as truly incredible vocal range and breath control (like Josh), listen to David Phelps.  You'll be blown away.
B00005JMFO|5.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is grand, actually.<br />\\"When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love.\\"<BR>-Hugh Grant (as Prime Minister) during opening credits of Film<br />the quote above is just one of the many things i loved about this film...when i went and saw \\"Love Actually\\" (Friday--the day it opened), I had two expectations in mind.  One: it would be just as good as i thought it would be, if not better.  Two: it...just...wouldn't.  haha Well, thankfully, my first hope was fulfilled.  \\"Love Actually\\" is grand...need I say more?<br />But I will.<br />The movie--soo good, wildly entertaining, extremely funny, heart-warming, and charming...very romantic...i fell in love with a certain handsome character (Rodrigo Santoro who plays Karl)...mama mia!!! ;-)  hehehe. When I went to the first showing at the box office, the lady behind me asked me what the movie was all about.  I only had to say but two words, and she was convinced.  Is that not cool, or what?  ;-)  <br />i recommend this movie immensely! it is so funny...(one of my favorite parts is the spectacle of Hugh Grant dancing about and through his house...too, too adorable. :o)  his moves...man oh man...maybe one of the best dance sequences I have ever scene...I mean, what is better than spontaneity when it comes to groovin'?  not much.  hehe Hugh Grant...boy, an incredibly talented actor, especially when it comes to humor, not to mention he could charm the boots off of anyone. :o) ) I also loved it when Liam Neeson had that \\"serious\\" talk with his stepson Sam, who he thought was having trouble dealing with his mother's death when \\"actually\\" his depressed mood was due to his passionate and painful unrequited love for a slightly older America pop star.  The eight or nine-year-old boy was so serious when he told Daniel (Neeson) that he wasn't too young to be in love...that, too, is so incredibly cute.=)  <br />    This movie will have you laughing at every point of the film. ok, well except for the really touching, tender moments like when Laura Linney goes to visit her brother in a pyschiatric hospital--her brother, who during Laura's last visit tries to strike her, but this time throws his manly arms around her and hugs her tightly--is the forgiving spirit of Christmas at work here?  maybe...you could go ahead and infer that. This random act of love may bring tears to your eyes, but of course some might be a little irked that in order for her to tend to her brother she had to forfeit her newly-begun relationship with the really tall, dark, and handsome Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro.  tut tut tut.  What a shame...they never did bring complete closure to what went on between the two.  That's maybe the one thing I disliked about the film.  the ONE.  haha...in other words, everything else was wonderful. hehe <br />And then there's the really sweet, romantic aspects of the film that will bring some, like my friend Kim, literally to tears. Who knows? Some people cry at weddings. Others, like me, cry at funerals. Who knows why really...who knows why.....<br />the characters are just too hilarious, too sweet, and too cute or cool or just so undeniably hot that you can't NOT like 'em. u kno whadda i mean? they're jus lovable characters, and you and your subconscious suddenly find yourselves relating to them because you or someone you know has been in the same or a very similar predicament as the characters brought to life on screen. The presence of Christmas was never overlooked. =) Well, ok, maybe that is truly obvious because the holdiay was the underlying theme of \\"Love Actually\\", but all shrewdness aside, the warm, fuzzy spirit gets you in such a way that you feel like leaping out of your seat, jumping up into the screen, and hugging every single person in the movie.  Hmmm...seriously now, what more can I ask for in a movie? A brilliant cast, a story set in the most celebrated, highly favored holiday of the year...the stars speaking in the most beloved accent of them all (English)...handsome, but humble men (who really don't take themselves too seriously), pretty but adorable ladies (ladies who seem to forget just how lovely they really are) and the cutest boy (Sam played by Thomas Sangster) you have ever laid eyes upon; and I mean, EVER. :D<br />Love Actually has it all. And the great part about it is, it's not just exclusive romantic love that is celebrated.  You have several forms....maybe even the most essential kinds--the love of a family, the love between a mother and daughter, stepfather and son, friend and friend, but most of all, the love of a community...a community joined for a single purpose: to present to the world a love that consumes and touches all.<br />I wanted to see \\"Elf\\" this past Friday, too, but since it was already late in the evening, I only had time to see one, so of course, I, being the Christamas-loving, romance fanatic that I am, chose the movie that has those similar aspects of humor and Christmas as I am sure is seen in \\"Elf\\", but with that added, much endorsed instance of love's beauty.  Love is actually the greatest thing on earth, and \\"Love Actually\\", well...attempts to show the most dear and great things about it. I must say, the makers of \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" succeeded in doing just that. (pip pip! cheers!!)<br />So throw away your cynicism and lame opposition to anything and everything that has to do with the entirely human emotion of love, and do yourself and every other cynic out there a favor...just see the movie!!  You won't regret it.  =)<br />(no pressure of course =P )
0553062182|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of self-help books, but something told me to read this one. I'm glad I did. It really helped me to understand things about myself that I'd struggled with for years. Before, I didn't understand why I'd freak out in crowds, why I'd often find myself retreating to stairwells or restrooms for solitude at work or school, or why large social gatherings often exhausted me when other people seemed energized by them. This book explains that highly sensitive people (HSPs) are simply a significant segment of the population born with a sensitive nervous system, and as a result are easily overstimulated and overwhelmed. It covers the pros and cons of being an HSP, and helps HSPs understand, accept and embrace who they are. If you suspect you are an HSP (or are married to or are the parent of one), I'd highly recommend this book.
B00009L1TA|2.0|This 2003 film is supposed to be a military thriller.  But in order to be a thriller the plot has to make at least a little sense.  This does not happen in &quot;Basic&quot;.  Sure, there's some good photography and a pretty good cast.  And sure, the military situation in Panama is unique and tied up with drug trafficking and a jungle setting.  But the plot is ridiculous.<br />John Travolta is the star.  He's cast as a former ranger who now works for the DEA.  We learn that Samuel L. Jackson, cast as a hard driving sergeant has supposedly been murdered in the jungle, presumably by his own men.  Connie Neilson is cast as the military officer who is supposed to question the suspects.  She's inept at a her job.  That's why they bring in John Travolta.  He's macho and disrespectful and naturally there is a romantic connection.<br />Everyone who is questioned about the murder gives a different story and the audience sees each of these stories in flashbacks.  It's hard to figure out what is real and what is unreal.  Did I say &quot;hard to figure out&quot;?  I should have said &quot;impossible&quot;.  That's because the film writer plays a trick on the audience and the film winds up in a way that is a complete turnaround from what was being presented.  The whole story is implausible and silly.<br />O.K. - it wasn't boring.  But that's about all I can say for this mess of a film.

Because the music just dont click<BR>for Josh, his voice will be hard to place in the classical side <BR>and the pop side of music.

B00006ALGL|4.0|Lisa Hannigan's voice begins where Damien Rice's ends. They are extensions of each other, combining elements of opera, gregorian chant, and a dramatic quality that could be in the most heart-wrenching of movies. Cold water is utterly desperate, reminding me of something out of an Elizabeth Smart poem, where the characters involved must somehow move on alone, even though tired and broken.  Eskimo, towards the end of the album, is more upbeat and playful  with a Finnish opera singer coming in at the climax of the song..very cool!  A treasured addition to  my CD collection.
B000001A3R|5.0|The originators of modern stoner rock are still the best.  With some other forms of music, the originators have been topped by their predecessors, but not Kyuss.  <BR>The first &quot;suite&quot; of three songs Gardenia/Asteroid/Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop, is viewed as the most coherent of the three.  Gardenia I believe is a song that sums of what stoner rock should be.  Heavy, but has a great groove and an awesome breakdown in the middle of the song.  Asteroid makes use of feedback and mellow to heavy explosions and Supa Scoop is just a classic Kyuss jam, switching tempo in midsong and back again.  The second &quot;suite&quot; consisting of 100 degrees/Space Cadet/Demon Cleaner is awesome,mellow,  yet inconsistent.  100 degrees is just a short punk feeling hard stoner song.  Space Cadet and Demon Cleaner are two of Kyuss' most mellow tracks ever and are a good low point in the album.  They are very intense however and are the best ganja jams on the cd.<BR>The third and final &quot;suite&quot; of Oddyssey/Conan Troutman/NO/Whitewater is the best suite on the album. All hard, heavy songs, this features guitar solos, psychadelic breakdowns and mellow jams all in one.  Whitewater is my favorite song on the album as well.<BR>Anyone looking to get into stoner rock should start here or with Blues for the Red Sun, then the less accessible &quot;And the Circus Leaves Town&quot;, then the first album &quot;wretch.&quot; I recommend that anyone who likes hard groovy music buy this album.
B00005V9IK|1.0|I didn't like this film at all.<BR>Too much fuss for nothing!<BR>Too many heroes,extraordinary unreal characters and behaviours... <BR> <BR>I like S.F. films however this one is way out of proportions.<BR>Armageddon, Deep Impact and Space Cowboys were FAAAR better films, more believable I would say.<BR>Take my word for it!<br />P.S.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Three years after the release of its debut MER DE NOMS, A Perfect Circle's THIRTEENTH STEP sees the light of day. By that time, Troy van Leeuwen and Paz Lenchantin had left and been replaced by bassist Jeordie Osborne White, formerly of Marilyn Manson, and guitarist James Iha, formerly of the Smashing Pumpkins (though he doe not appear on the album). While van Leeuwen appear on part of the set, guitarist Danny Lohner helped out after he departed. <br />Amazingly, despite the changes, the sound is still very much the creation of Billy Howerdel with the unmistakable vocal of Maynard Keenan from Tool. Produced by Howerdel and mixed by the inimitable Andy Wallace, THIRTEENTH STEP is a moodier, tenser, and more atmospheric (if that is possible) recording than its predecessor. Written mostly by Howerdel and Keenan, the songs traverse a particular associated with surrender, loss, having the nature of a person stripped away, and turning in the twilight of those feelings toward a kind of slow transformation into something that can only be called &quot;other.&quot; <br />There are no easy outs and no easy answers, only hard questions throughout &quot;Weak and Powerless,&quot; where surrender is necessary but far from desired. The title bitingly refers to the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, but this is not your average recovery outing. Tracks like &quot;Blue,&quot; &quot;Vanishing,&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; (one of two tracks featuring the amazing Jarboe on vocals) feature a kind of barely restrained menace caught in a trap by rock &amp; roll vulnerability. The wide dynamic swathes that were so prominent on the band's debut are all but absent here. The squalling guitars have taken a backseat to carefully crafted melodies where atmospherics are maximized and pulled taut over the listener. <br />While not a radical departure from MER DE NOMS, there is a real progression here. However, the explosive, heavier-than-heavy rock-ism of A Perfect Circle is so well known for it isreadily evidenced on cuts such as &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;Pet.&quot; As moods shapeshift from the sepia-toned murk of &quot;The Package&quot; and &quot;The Noose,&quot; the over the top hard rock to the Baroquely scaled &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Gravity,&quot; with its beautiful guitar effects and crystalline bass line, the listener becomes aware of just how much water has traveled under A Perfect Circle's bridge. THIRTEENTH STEP is the sound of a musical and lyrical maturity that normally doesn't occur until a band's third or fourth albums. Lyrically, musically, sonically, the THIRTEENTH STEP is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Ever since my wife discovered them, I have not looked forward to a band's output as I have for the White Stripes. This duo (husband/wife? brother/sister? Who cares?) has given rock music the shot in the arm it needs before it dies of boredom. \\"Black Math\\" and \\"Seven Nation Army\\" are just unbelievably great songs. Their rendition of Burt Bacharach's \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\" ranges from the sorrowful to howling pain. The entire album is a testament to this band's range. Jack and Meg kick butt, and rock needs its butt kicked right now.
B00005JM02|5.0|The very colorful, very funny, very emotional and somewhat scary FINDING NEMO is entertainment at its best. I absolutely loved this movie. Ellen DeGeneres is hilarious! I recommend this movie to everyone. It can be, however, a bit scary and unsettling for the younger folks and anyone that fears the ocean on any level. I personally thought some of the shark chase sequences and the descend to the abyss a bit unsettling, so there you go!
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is an excellent novel telling the story of the Corleone family and their family business.  The novel also tells the story of the Mafia and is very informative about it.  The reader can learn all about the workings of the underworld crime business.  More than the Mafia though, The Godfather tells the story of the people in the Corleone family.  From Don Vito Corleone to his hot-tempered son Santino, the calm and cool Michael to adopted son Tom Hagen, the Godfather is full of great characters, all of them fully developed and very believable.  The story follows the family as they struggle to survive in New York with the other powerful Mafia families closing in for the kill.  There is plenty here for readers.  The Godfather has an exciting story, great characters, and plenty of excitement throughout.  The story never slows down from beginning to end, and it should not be missed.<br />  It may seem obvious, but if you like the novel check out the movie directed by Francis Ford Copola.  It is rare when a movie is as good as the book it was based on, but here both are truly great.  Don't miss either!  Check out The Godfather by Mario Puzo!
B00008H2LB|1.0|Ho - Hum I reviewed Hybrid Theory ( NO BASS, NO FEELING) and gave it 1 star. I would give this nothing if I could. I find it funny that this realesed about the same time as Deftones new album and all the teeny boppers and Backstreet Boys fans went   out and bought this album instead of a good one. But hey I am not surprised, this is just a happy meal, mass marketed overplayed, overated, plastic junk. If you are 13 go out and buy it, who cares. AHHHH.
B00004WGAI|5.0|So far I've seen the Willam Hurt, George C. Scott and Cirian Hinds's versions besides this one, but by far this is my favorite! The one with WH rushed through almost too fast for even a taste of the story, Scott was the most bearish Rochester I've ever seen (besides the shock of Jane with grayish hair and wrinkles!), and Cirain Hinds was TOO volatile. Timothy Dalton was just wonderful though. It was different enough from the other actors' interpretations of the role to keep me literally on the edge of my seat, but not so wild that the character was ruined for me (like in Scott's version). Jane is perhaps a little under done, and the series was obviously filmed on a low-budget, but this one still reigns number one!
B00005JMFR|5.0|THANX, Wachowski Brothers, you did it again(my hats off to you)  People from various sources are giving Matrix Revolutions bad reviews, BUT I'm here to kill the noise. First of all PEOPLE, this is what Sci-Fi's are all about, \\"The Un-Imaginable & Artificial Intelligence\\". I appreciated the film writers keeping to the script from the very first dialog of the first movie.  <br />What I mean by that is sticking with the definition of the themes and Characters;<br />((((MATRIX)))): A substance in which something is embedded or enclosed.  ORACLE:  source of wisdom: somebody or something considered being a source of knowledge, wisdom, or prophecy.<br />((((AGENT)))):  Somebody representing another.<br />((((TRINITY)))): The union of the three (Neo, Morpheus & Trinity).  <br />((((RELOADED)))):  To put a new load into something (i.e. Film in a camera, HINT! remember they ran out of film and went bankrupt!)<br />((((REVOLUTION)))):  A dramatic change in ideas and practice.  NOW, I close you with this.<br />The Matrix Trilogy was to provoke Thought, Criticism, Idealism, Physical Capability, Love, Unity, Division, Faith and lastly to Form Moral Belief.  The people that were disappointed may not be true fans of creativity and originality, they were maybe looking for trend (about like what Charlie's Angels did with BULLET-TIME, What-a-JOKE). <br />What I took from all three movies were: \\"If you don't STAND for what you believe in, you can FALL for anything\\" Not to mention allowing the non-believers to come inside of you (Agent's Smith's cloning method).  The movie could have been 8 hours long; I still don't think the people would have caught the subliminal message.  Everthing that has a beginning, must have an end...... Way to close the book.<br />I can't leave w/o saying:   GOD BLESS YOU first Oracle and Aaliyah, you would have been great in the final wrap....
0385504209|4.0|Don't believe the hype! This is a fun, trashy, read which has a great place in over-night bags. It is absolutely ideal reading for long weekends. The mystery is fun, the writing easy to digest, and the adventure is exciting. But don't contemplate it too long or it falls apart. It's no Uberto Eco book, and the big surprises won't be surprising for anyone who's read a little history, but I don't regret my purchase at all.
B0000041XX|5.0|I can't remember how many times I played this CD, it is absolutely a treasure for me. This is certainly the best of all the three tenor's concerts, their voices were rich and well maintained, the orchestra played well. Every song is just superb. Their interpretation to the pop songs were lovely and refreshing. The only regret is that there won't be such a moment any more, which makes the CD so memorable.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This cd is sheer perfection.  It's as good as it gets.  What a voice! Two words:  BUY IT!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I love Dream Theater, I mean, ask anyone who knows me, and they know how much I worship these guys.  However, this album so far seems to be starting off as a letdown.  The songs are starting to grow on me, but they seem very structured.  I like how Dream Theater typically tried to stay from having refrains as often and whatnot, but it seems like they have in this album.  Also, the songs just don't seem as tecnical as they could be, though the solos are still amazing.  I tend to find that a lot of the songs sound alike, sorta the mix they used in the Glass Prison(I even think the 2nd track is supposed to be an extension of the Glass Prison).  I defintely wanted a track similar to 6 Degrees or even Blind Faith more.  I like how all the songs are long, and the instrumental parts always grow on me.  Either way, this is Dream Theater, and Ill always buy their cds and still respect them for their music.
B000002KIE|5.0|Ok, boys and girls, THIS is music. All you people out there that think all these frieken pop/punk bands *cough*GoodCharlotte*cough* are great well, you need to wake up and hear the Pistols! This is one of the greatest albums ever and the point it brings across is just awesome, Sid Viciuos has the greatest punk rock voice I have ever heard and these songs actually have MEANING TO THEM. So, all you little &quot;puink rockers&quot; out there that think pop/punk bands are hardcore, pick this damn album up NOW!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I must say that Dream Theater never fail to amaze me.  TRAIN OF THOUGHT is by far the heaviest Dream Theater release, and it rocks.  HARD!!!!  From the first song, As I Am, to the last, In The Name Of God, it's definitely one of the best releases I've heard from them.  &quot;DON'T CROSS THE CROOKED STEP&quot; (Honor Thy Father), has to be one of the most haunting vocal lines I've ever heard from these guys.  All in all, it's a very solid release, and if you're a big Dream Theater fan that evolves with the band, you will not be disappointed.

B0000C0FJB|5.0|When Vital Signs came out, I expected a lot more. The mixing was horrible and the songs sounded forced, like a pale imitation of Radiohead and Metallica. That said, the songs from Vital Signs on the Rush in Rio box set come to life (check out Earthshine--AWESOME). I've read a lot of commentary on the sound problems in Rush in Rio. I have every standard issue Rush album, a few of the Euro bootlegs, and all of the live albums. Sound quality aside, this is the BEST performance album EVER put out by the trio. The saying &quot;attitude determines your altitude&quot; applies, as the enthusisasm of the crowd (which is mixed in way too loud) brings the band to life. Unlike other recent live Rush albums and recent tours, on Rush in Rio Geddy Lee actually tries to hit the high notes he did in his 20s and 30s and pulls it off efectively. Highly recommended if you love Rush, and can get over the limitations of the mix.
0385504209|5.0|OK, I don't know where I have been, but I had not seen the reviews or had heard about the book until a friend who loved it actually bought me a copy.  Ignorance is bliss.  I have not done this in years, but I picked up the book to read for an hour and 6 1/2 hours later I still had not put it down.  I finished it in two days; I had even debated missing work to finish it.<br />Since I hadn't heard about the book, the surprises and twists were fun and suspenseful.  It will not change my faith because I read it as fiction.  I can't wait to look up some of the paintings referenced.  This book is just a fun read and I am looking forward to discussing it with friends.
B000002PBL|5.0|This is without a doubt Tom Petty's finest recording. From the opening Byrds riff of &quot;The Waiting&quot;, every song is a winner, and several are absolutely breathtaking. Two years after coming into their prime with what many would say is their best album, &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot;, Petty and the Heartbreakers raised the bar lyrically while remaining at their musical peak. The worst songs were as good as their earlier material, while the best transcended anything done previously or since.<br />Some of the songs would have fit well on &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot; - the same sound, great performances, fine lyrics, and simply more of what TP fans loved 20-some years ago. Others went in new musical or lyrical directions and succeeded well, from the lighter pop sounds of &quot;Letting You Go&quot; and &quot;You Can Still Change Your Mind&quot; to the Dylanesque storyline in &quot;Something Big&quot;. The icing on the cake, though, are the heartfelt and increasingly sophisticated lyrics that range from moving to passionate and even sublime on &quot;The Waiting&quot;, &quot;A Woman In Love&quot;, &quot;Letting You Go&quot;, &quot;You Can Still Change Your Mind&quot;, and especially the glorious &quot;Insider&quot;.<br />&quot;Insider&quot;, a duet with Stevie Nicks, is a quiet song that builds to a passionate, gutwrenching climax of understated but profoundly moving bitterness. I consider it the best song here (actually I consider it the best song ever written by Tom Petty), and the album title was taken from its lyrics. I can't imagine a better song about the pain of a relationship gone sour or lost.<br />&quot;Hard Promises&quot; was the last of 4 nearly-perfect albums of increasing quality between 1976 and 1981. This is Tom Petty grown up, but not old. After &quot;Hard Promises&quot; the band began a slow decline, producing 4 inconsistent and even bad albums before Petty's comeback with the Traveling Wilburys and Full Moon Fever. There were some really good songs even in that period of decline, and I respect the way TP tried going in new directions and took chances. But if you like the early sound of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, it simply doesn't get any better than this.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Finally the wait is over and the new album is here. I am sitting here listening to the cd as I write this review.<BR>   This album is INCREDIBLE!  Josh is SO talented and is truly one of the best singers ever. He is up there with Andrea Bocceli and Celine Dion. He is amazing.<BR>   I love all the songs from this album. But I think my three favorites are &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; and &quot;My Confession&quot;! But they are all great.<BR>    I would REALLY recommend this Cd to anyone and everyone. Its awesome.

B00005YW4H|4.0|First let me remember other jazz classics. ED TORR. STEVEN BRIDGE. CREATIVE WRITER 2. Finally, CREATIVE WRITER 2... I look at them and I know straight away welcome back, but then I turn to this album:<br />Come Away and Then<BR>Norah Davis<br />And I think to myself, how does this stuff manage to bring for them all? The content of the album is OFFENSIVE, shamelessly slandering my close friend named KING FOURTEEN, which is, to its credit, unable to make it. <br />I would not listen to this if offered a long brush in return, quite frankly, it's utter grenade.<br />One listen and you're hooked, be prepared to spend all those nights alone listening to this fantastic first album of Norah Jones, and be taken away by the incredible solo-work, unrivalled even by Dexter Holland, lead guitarist of The Philip Glass Band and consider by most the biggest seven alive.<br />Terrible buy, full marks: 3 out of 5
B0000CAQ26|3.0|Misunderstood is one of the best albums of the past few years, so I was highly anticipating her new album Try This. However, what was so great about Misunderstood is gone. While there are a few good songs, most notably the first 4 tracks, the rest of the album falls under the category of Pink trying to hard to prove shes a badass. While foul language doesn't offend me, she uses the &quot;F&quot; word in half of her songs, and I don't see the point. Yes Pink, you're angry, we get that, but lets get a little more original in our choice of words. Most of the songs lean towards rock which gets old very quick, because no song stands on it's own. They all seem to blend into one another. Pinks voice also sounds raspier and tired, and the once powerful voice which made songs like Just a Pill, Get the Party Started, and Family Portrait so amazing, sounds strained and without personality.When Pink does try to showcase her pipes on the ballad Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, she comes across as a wannabe Christina. As a huge Pink fan, I was a very disappointed.
B000089RVR|5.0|It seemed to me there were two large groups of people waiting quite keenly for the release of this album. Gathered together in one corner sat Dido's large contingent of fans, desperate for a new batch of songs. Lurking with intent in the opposite corner were the hordes of Dido-bashers, eager for a new reason to rant and rave again. Indeed, with the release date looming, some couldn't stop themselves from jumping up and down and screaming &quot;coffee-table-music&quot; at innocent passers-by. Having realised how wrong the bashers were about &quot;No Angel&quot;, Dido's first album, I was one of those looking forward to this album. I have no doubts that people will continue to criticise - on the basis of this album, however, they will continue to be wrong.<BR> <BR>The connection between Dido and Faithless continues with this album. Rollo, Dido's brother, and Sister Bliss had both contributed to &quot;No Angel&quot;. Dido then returned the favour by providing lead vocals on &quot;One Step Too Far&quot;, a single lifted from the band's &quot;Outrospective&quot; album. Now, with &quot;Life for Rent&quot;, Rollo features strongly with a number of co-writing and co-producing credits while Sister Bliss plays on four of the tracks.<br />The album starts with four of its strongest tracks. The first and third tracks are &quot;White Flag&quot; and &quot;Life for Rent&quot;, the album's first two singles. Sound and style wise, I don't think either would have sounded too far out of place on &quot;No Angel&quot;. However, &quot;Stoned&quot;, the second track, is something of a surprise in comparison. There's a slight change in sound, less acoustic and more of a keyboards-driven song. At first, I wasn't sure what to make of it but I'd now consider it to be the best of the bunch. Lyrically at odds with the nice-girl-next-door image Dido seems to have acquired, it's definitely a grower. The fourth track, &quot;Mary's in India&quot; is the first on the album to combine the keyboards and acoustic elements of the previous songs. &quot;Sand in my Shoes&quot;, found later in the album, takes the same approach - both songs are quite simply excellent. There is also a hidden track - called, by the sounds of things, &quot;The Closer You Get&quot;. It's one of those really pleasant, mellow, acoustic numbers Dido does so well. <br />So much for the &quot;difficult&quot; second album - I'd say this one surpasses &quot;No Angel&quot;.
B00005JM0B|5.0|The Terminator series is a rare series indeed. Each movie keeps getting better and better! Prior to the third movie release, T2 was my obvious favorite out of the series. But now T3 is cleary my new favorite in the series! <BR>The action is non-stop and the story is one of the best out of all of the movies that came out this year! The extras on the DVD are excellent and will keep you glued to your TV. Too bad Arnold is Governor right now. I am really wanting to see a fourth film in the series!
B000002LIX|5.0|This is a classic album and deserves great respect.My favourite song would have to be ''of course'' because its so melodic and brilliant,no matter what kind of music your into you will love this classic and excellent album(just buy it and enjoy!).
B00004T9UF|5.0|First, Eminem is not a genius. Maybe smart or clever, but not a genius. I'm sick of hearing that. But this album is sick. The majority of rappers nowadays are all over the radio singin' stupid p***y love songs. Like Westside Connection said, you can't tell rap from R&amp;B anymore. I mean, I love Jay-Z, but unless you know what album it's on, can you tell a Jay-Z song from a Beyonce' song? Listen to &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and then listen to &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;. Both of them could be on the same album and you wouldn't know if it was an R&amp;B album, or a rap album. That's what I like about Eminem. He brings back that fierce, defiant vibe into rap. Rap used to provoke and inspire and shock the mainstream. Now, it IS the mainstream. LOL You got rich old businessmen and soccer moms that know alot of rap songs by heart. I like Jay, but his harder stuff is never heard. Just his singles. That's why we need rappers like Eminem or Nas or DMX (Yes, DMX). I ABSOLUTELY don't think Eminem is the greatest MC of all time. S**t, he's not even in my top 10. But he has changed the face of rap and this is an insane album. One of the best rap albums ever. Clever lyrics in songs like &quot;Stan&quot; or songs that shock like &quot;Kim&quot; or fierce songs like &quot;The Way I Am&quot;. Rap needs more seriousness and less p***y's. I don't wanna hear about how Fabolous is in love or Ja Rule or LL Cool J (although he used to be my favorite rapper when he was in his prime.). We need more rappers like Eminem or Nas or Tupac or Biggie or Jay-Z (when he's doin' his thing). Hopefully, Eminem will be around for a little while longer.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|As in &quot;System Of A Down meets Dream Theater.&quot;<br />I find it amusing when prog bands or yesterday's rock bands try to update their sound for today's MTV generation. Don't these bands realize that unless MTV airs the video and dictates that Band X or Mix Master Mofo is cool, that kids won't buy it?<br />Deep Purple and Rush tried updating their sound and failed poorly. Even YES did it lyrically on &quot;That, That Is&quot; (from the album &quot;Keys To Ascension 1,&quot; Jon Anderson forgoes songs about love and happiness and sings about gangs and crack babies). Dream Theater does it here but is more successful. The only band that has updated their sound without pandering or sounding exactly like present-day bands is King Crimson with &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; - which by the way is a GREAT album.<br />I'm not really picking on this CD. It certainly rocks big time and won't disappoint Dream Theater fans but when all is said and done, the songs don't really stand up to most of their earlier material melody-wise. After all, the band wrote the entire CD in 3 weeks.<br />But then again, when did melody have anything to do with metal?
B00006690G|3.0|In my mind, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; is Eminem's weakest album. For some reason, people think it's his best. Mostly, people that don't know rap. There are songs on this album that feel like they should've been on &quot;The Marshal Mathers LP&quot;. <br />White America<BR>Sing For The Moment<BR>'Till I Collapse<br />These are the only songs on the album that I think are &quot;Great&quot;.<br />There are a couple other songs that are good, but several are just weak. Songs like &quot;Squaredance&quot;, &quot;Without Me&quot;, Hallies Song&quot; and &quot;Cleaning Out My Closet&quot; are just WEAK. &quot;Cleaning Out My Closet&quot; is a song alot of people liked, but this song felt like it should've been cut. I've never had a problem with Em talking about his mother, but I got a little tired of his bi*chin' on this one. This just is not Eminem in his prime. &quot;The Marshal Mathers LP&quot; is a MUCH better album. This album just feels like he's ran out of things to rap about.
B000002GQL|5.0|I almost feel sorry for people who have never experienced this brilliant album.<br />After what seemed impossible to do, the Moodies produced yet another classic album after the great &quot; Days of Future Passed&quot;.<br />&quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot; is available as a digitally remastered CD and sounds better than ever.  Featuring some of the best penned ballads, this album pulls you in and doesn't let go.<br />Some comments on certain track listings are: <br />1. Lost In A Lost World  - perfect introduction to a classic set<BR>2. New Horizons - just when you thought you'd heard all of Justin Haywards ballads, this one comes along!<BR>3. For My Lady - as many have stated, this sounds medieval.  It truly does, and is totally beautiful. <BR>4. Isn't Life Strange - an all-time classic, almost their signature tune?          <BR>8. I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)- maybe my least favourite track on the album, probably not a great way to finish the album off.  Nevertheless, it is still a well crafted song.<br />Who wouldn't put this album in their Top 10 of all time?
B00000IQC8|5.0|I really liked the rawness of the movie. You can tell that Hollywood, black,  Armani, Turtle Necks are completely confused by this movie doing so well. The characters seemed more real than the usual La La Land ilk. They reminded me of people with whom I hung out. I am 40 and I still think this is a pretty funny movie. It also is a must if you like any of the other Kevin Smith Movies. Another indie movie like this, but with a college theme is The Blur of Insanity. Anyway buy Clerks and watch the Turtle Necks squirm!
B000002GQH|4.0|The Moody Blues had a wave of successful albums late 60's, early 70's.  This was released 1969 and features some gorgeous ballads and uptempo tracks:<br />The tracks to look out for are:<br />2. Lovely to See You <BR>3. Dear Diary<BR>4. Send Me No Wine  <BR>5. To Share Our Love <BR>7. Never Comes the Day          <BR>8. Lazy Day  <br />I love this band, and feel blessed to know their music!
B00009EIQE|5.0|Ignore any negative remarks you may hear. This is a great blues CD. There are always people who just don't get it or just can't feel it. Luckily for those of us who do, Buddy Guy delivers big time with this one!! Lucy Mae Blues will have you rocking in your seat and Sally Mae will take the tension right out of your neck! As for the rest, it just doesn't get much blues-ier or better than this one!
B00000IQC8|5.0|The first time i saw this movie was at my friend's house with bunch of guys and my one best friend. Being that there was just me and one other girl there, made some parts rather uncomforatable, but i cannot deny the fact that i laughed my head off during the entire thing! i love that it's like a home video, it makes it unique in the movie world, and it's also black and white. how cool is that? omg, my friend is so obsessed with this movie, and how can he not be? it's so hilarious! You must see this movie! it really is too bad that more people don't know about, so show it to ur friends...37 of 'em, in fact.
B00006GO99|5.0|Monk's first album for Columbia is a quartet session, as so many of them are, and featured what would be his steady band for a few years, with Rouse, Dunlop, and Ore. The highlight is the title song. Monk had such inventive names for his compositions, part of the fun is finding a way to correlate them to the music. &quot;Monk's Dream&quot; seems to me to have a distinctively dream-like quality, though I'm at a loss to describe it coherently with words. No matter. It's vintage Monk--strange, humorous, beautiful. Charlie Rouse's solo on &quot;Bright Mississippi&quot; may very well be the very best solo he's ever played--he begins, quite cleverly, by falling off the cliff of Monk's composition, and spends the rest of his solo climbing his way out and ascending. It's a shame then, that it's followed immediately by an extremely rare poor Monk solo--he seems quite lost and never catches fire. This album also has the wonderful tune &quot;Bye-ya&quot;, and Monk's signature solo run-through of &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This cd takes off right from 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence (disc 1).  From the first track (As I Am) until the end, Dream Theater rips.  The album is heavier and faster then their previous work.  You can hear the influence of Metallica (Blackened and Sanitarium) on some of the songs.  This album is more Metal then Progressive Rock.  A lot of fans have been disappointed, however this is exactly what I was hoping for after the last album.  I personally like the heavy songs from DT (Lie, The Glass Prison, etc) and Train of Thought delivers this throughout.<br />This album would be 9/10 (but I had to round up).  There are some parts (a brief \\"rap\\" bit for example in Honor Thy Father) in a couple songs that aren't needed.  However, this album shows Dream Theater branching out of the stereo-typical Progressive box.  Drummer Mike Portnoy made comments earlier this year that this album was going to be a classic Metal album (ie Metallica and Iron Maiden feel), and it is that to the next degree.<br />Buy this today!!!
B000002UAX|5.0|In response to &quot;A Music Fan&quot;s comments about &quot;MusicalGenious&quot;s review of the White Album, I would like to point out that Musical Genious was obviously joking around. If you click on his name you will see that he goes around Amazon.com writing very humurous reviews panning obvious classics like Indiana Jones and the Beatles, and praising crap like Hilay Duff. He is obviously a Beatles fan and this is just a joke of his. Don't be so reactionary, &quot;A Music Fan&quot;
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you watch the video clips on the enhanced CD, Mike Portney and John Petrucci talk about how they wrote &quot;Train of Thought&quot; in three weeks!  <br />Dream Theater never ceases to amaze me.  This album is the epitome of modern progressive metal.  There aren't many bands out there who can write, produce, and execute as well as DT.  This album is exemplary of their development into one of the best progressive rock bands of all time.<br />Musically, this album departs from the more melodic and borderline rock tradition evidenced on their previous album.  Train of Thought takes on an aggressive and serious theme reminiscent of Images and Words, with Petrucci trading off solos with Rudess like a tennis match!  The rhythm section is as tight as ever on this one...and you can actually hear John Myung!    <br />I can't wait to see them live again.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005JMFR|3.0|This movie follows the final stages of the battle between humans and machines and the choices Neo must face. In the beginning, Neo is in a place between the matrix and reality called the train station. I won't tell you anymore because it would spoil the movie. I thought the fight between Neo and Agent Smith was well done but the ending seemed underdone. But it was still a movie I would reccomend to see in theaters. Overall, it's not as good as the first two (the first one being the best) but it is still a movie that sticks to the story and sort of completes the matrix regime.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is an amazing album that will ultimately inspire those who here it. There is such a strong drive behind Groban's vocals, and that is a talent that not many have. I love listening to an artist who I know has real talent, and Groban has just that.
0375432302|5.0|This was the first book I read of this author and I've finished it in 1 week. I just loved it. The details are amazing and surprisingly not boring at all. I'm reading &quot;Deception Point&quot; now and I'm loving it so far. I'm really impressed.
B00000JPHF|3.0|Boris Karloff is the only Frankenstein. This movie brings back memories of Nightmare Theater in Dallas in the early 1960's on TV channel 11. Most notable are the electrical spark machines that bring the monster to life. The film quality was not as good as I thought it would be on tape or DVD, but the story and spookiness does overcome this. The B&amp;W adds to the spookie atmosphere. One drawback - the movie only lasts about 70 minutes. I would rate the movie much higher if the clarity were better and it lasted longer, but this an all time collector's movie. Always great to watch around Hallowe'en and with the kids late at night with pizza or nachos.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Rumor has it that when Akira released, Disney told all of their animators to watch it, and told them they had to play catch-up. The animation is spectacular, the story and characters are memorable. Voice-overs are above average for anime. The DVD looks much better than the original VHS release.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|In my opinion this second isntallment of &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy was better than the first one.  The fight scenes were better and the special effects and stunt work were outstanding, even surpassing those of the first movie.  Of course, once again, this is a movie that you must really pay attention too.  I found myself lost at times, with holes in plot that I couldn't quite figure out.  Hopefully the third installment will fill these holes in.  Although not really my normal type of movie I found myself enjoying this one.  Although it would pay to see the first one before watching this one I think if you take it at face value you might not be any more lost that I was if you didn't see the first one.<br />The concept that the movies are based on is deep for me to think about.  The fact that life could be an actual computer program.  That we could be nothing more than programmed entities.  These deep thoughts that you could bounce around again and again are intriguing.    <br />Bottom line, in my opinion, enjoyable but not outstanding.
B000002B7M|5.0|This was the first(of many) ozzy cd´s I bought,and it´s really great.<BR>Many pepole ask me what´s so great about ozzy osbourne and the first thing I tell them is this:<BR>He Has a Brilliant Voice.<br />One thing that it´s not so good about his first solo release is this: This it´s not heavy metal.<BR>It´s simply hard rock.<BR>One of these days I bought the first release from Black Sabbath from 1969 and actually it´s heavier than Blizzard of Ozz.<BR>Now let´s see the songs:<br />1. I Don't Know: A bit overrated but a solid effort.<BR>2. Crazy Train:A well known song but excellent. <BR>3. Goodbye To Romance: a strong ballad, it´s quite cool.<BR>4. Dee: this song could have been much longer, but it´s a great instrumental.<BR>5. Suicide Solution: One of my favourites, with excellent chorus and verses. And i can actually hear: GET YOUR GUN AND SHOOT!<BR>6. Mr. Crowley: Amazing! Everything is great especially the guitar, i don´t like the fade out in the end with that great chorus though.<BR>7. No Bone Movies: Just a rocker. Nothing especial. <BR>8. Revelation (Mother Earth): The instrumental part is the high point, but not bad at all. <BR>9. Steal Away (The Night): It has excellent verses but the chorus is a bit repetitve.<br />All in all it´s a great album thanks to Randy axe-work, and ozzy´s melodic vocals.<BR>If you want a great hard rock album buy this one.
0375823360|5.0|I think that this trilogy of books is one of the best series I have ever read.  I enjoy some fantasy, but I am often dismayed by the way fantasy books tend to rely on clichés, making the books less engaging for me.  These are not that kind of books!!<br />Although the books are supposedly for children, they deal with philosophical themes that kids might not understand, although the story is engaging enough.  I would definitely recommend it to adults who are willing to look at traditional religious stories from a new perspective.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|After 6 years of wondering when Sarah McLachlan was going to have another album, I was very happy to hear about her release of Afterglow.<BR>I felt that her previous album and popular songs off of Surfacing would be a tough act to follow, but if anyone could do it, this master of words and music could.<BR>After listening to the entire CD, I was amazingly disappointed. I failed to find anything but songs that basically sounded alike with no variety.<BR>One thought came to mind. Good elevator music but that's about it. And to think, I was previously ready to put her in the ranks with Joni Mitchell.<BR>Sarah failed with this one. Perhaps (and I hope), the next album will be better. She has written and performed some great music, but not on this album.<BR>Anyone want to buy a slightly used CD?<BR>I suggest holding off buying the CD and borrowing it from a friend first and make up your own mind.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Several different love stories entwined into one movie.  Can't wait for the outtakes on some of these on the dvd.  Some stories I felt were unnecessary and if removed would make this a good family movie.  Would love for the kids to see the little boy's story of love.  The best stories are the little boy, colin firth, emma thompson, and laura linney.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Anyone who has followed Sarah knows that Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is only her first solo outing.. She goes back to the days of Manufacture, a industrial band, signed on Nettwerk Records out of Canada. Listen to the background vocals on some of their tracks off the Armed Forces cd and you'll recognize her magical voice.  She was credited for singing background vocals on their cd!!!
6305841861|5.0|If your not a Bruce Campbell or Sam Raimi fan this &quot;B&quot; movie will either annoy you or turn you into a fan.  The people who wrote bad reviews on this disk turned down the wrong road when they thought they were getting into realistic serious horror.  This movie was not meant to be taken seriously; if you take it seriously you will be very dissapointed  This is slapstick cheesy horror comedy at it's best.  Bruce Campbell's one liners make the whole Evil Dead trilogy worth watching.
B00005JKC3|2.0|By taking it too seriously. That's how. This thing labors along like it thinks it's Schindler's List. It's a comic book movie. Where's the joy? The adventure? The freaking FUN? It's buried under an over-long expository first act, bad over-acting (Sam Elliot), bad under acting (Eric Bana), and some really silly concepts (a hulk poodle?).<br />And just because people keep saying the CGI &quot;looks real&quot;, it doesn't make it so. It's good CGI, but in the end that's all it is. They just don't have the technology to do a realistic human face yet. So forr all of the effort that went into it, the result is just distracting.  <br />This gets 2 stars for the small amount of action scenes near the end that didn't make me want to sleep.
B0000CFW87|5.0|The whole album is breathtaking!!!!His voice is smooth and soothing.This is another album you'll never get tired of listening just like his debut album.The new songs are great.I can't wait to see him at the Shrine!!!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the most harrowing pieces of drama to grace the screen.  The portrayal of the airborne infantry during World War II is stark, unsentimental, and at times very unpleasant.  We're glad for such a detailed portrayal over the course of the US' involvement in World War II, and for the dramatization of details that would otherwise be lost to history.  In the end, no one in their right mind would think the European theater was anything but horrific for these infantrymen.<br />We see in the first episode that the men of Easy Company are human - fallible, ordinary, and in some cases mediocre.  At the final episode, we see that the strengths and weaknesses of each member of Easy Company contribute to the unit's combat success. The names for the most part are real.  The cliches are out the window - some of the men were strong, a few were weak, but all were heroes.  I don't know if I needed to know the name of the first failed company commander, or the name of a unit member who committed a petty crime...but in the end all of these men contributed to the astonishing combat success of Easy Company, whether they intended to or not.<br />It's shocking to see how young the actors are...didn't we just see some of them in a music video?  However,  in many cases, the men they portrayed were even younger.  In the D-Day episode, we are treated to a near non-stop barrage of sound effects - anti-aircraft, artillery, and naval gunfire.  It continues for nearly an hour, and doesn't stop for breath.  Later episodes are just as illustrative...you feel hot and exposed during the Market Garden segment, cold during the Bastogne segment, and by the time Easy Company reaches Berchtesgaden you're anxious for the men to come home.<br />As the series progresses we see the human tragedy of the wasted lives, death, and the folly of fascist dictators.  We're glad that someone stood up to the Axis, at such a huge cost.  This series should be required viewing for young adults and for civilian leaders in a democracy.ilian leaders in a democracy.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Jennifer is cute, Ben is a little lame, ok movie.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|every listen i like it more. the craziest instrumental work JP &amp; jordan have done together. sheesh!
B0000CAQ26|5.0|Finding your groove is important to an artist, it seems like, and with this CD Pink has found it.  I liked her previous stuff but not enough to listen to it much.  Granted, I love Rancid and think Indestructible is perhaps the greatest punk album since London Calling, and when I found out he worked on this one I scooped it up.<br />Tim Armstrong's influence rattles and holds together many of these songs all right, but man can Pink sing.  On several songs she has that rich, throaty delivery that is more than vaguely reminiscent of Joan Osborne.  This CD shows a range of vocals not found on her previous stuff.<br />Slam in Armstrong's arrangements and guitars, and this is a great one.  Nice to see an artist progressing instead of, say, ending up like Jewel(let's see, spend some time with Rancid, or hang out with a tobacco-chewing Rodeo dude and crank out lukewarm early-eighties techno-rot...).
B000002KKX|5.0|Throughout my years of listening to music, Christopher Cross has always been one of my favorites.  From his upbeat classic rock songs to his beautiful ballads, one just cannot like this great vocalist.  This album is Christopher's debut album, and the one that jump started his career.  The hits &quot;Never be the Same, Sailing, Ride Like the Wind, and Minstrel Gigolo&quot; all put Christopher Cross on the map.  Since I love this album so much I will go through and rate each song:<br />&quot;Say You'll be Mine&quot;-A very beautiful upbeat 80's sounding ballad that will have you singing along. 5/5<br />&quot;Never Be the Same&quot;-Yet another wonderful song that I enjoy listening to over and over. For some reason it just never gets old...5/5<br />Moving on to the less popular hits on the album...&quot;Poor Shirley&quot; is a nice mid-tempo song that has a lot going for it.  &quot;Spinning&quot; is primarily a generic ballad, not too particularly fond of this one.  &quot;The Light is On&quot; is a pleasant uptempo song that really adds some flavor to the album.  &quot;I Really Don't Know Anymore&quot;-Another wonderful ballad from Chris, another one of my favorites.  Spinning gets a 3/5 while the rest get a 4.5/5.<br />&quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot;-One of the best songs on the album, very upbeat and Michael McDonald backing the vocals.  &quot;And, I've got a long way to go, to make it to the border of Mexico...&quot; 5/5<br />&quot;Sailing&quot;-Words can't describe how much this song means to me.  Far and Away the best song on the album.  The enchanting lyrics and smooth music will help you drift away to Neverland.  This is the song that defines Christopher Cross. 6/5<br />&quot;Minstrel Gigolo&quot;-A song about rock stars, is a nice mid-tempo song that runs a bit long, but has a lot of heart. 4.5/5<br />All in all, Christopher Cross was one of the greatest performers of the 80's and into the 90's as well.  If you enjoy songs with a relaxed tone and a great melody, then be sure to look into this album, it is probably the best one to start with.  After this I recommend &quot;Another Page&quot; and &quot;Red Room&quot; as well.  Both of them are just as terrific as the first.  So, give Chris a try, you won't regret it...
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Once again Pearl Jam kills it with another touch of masterpiece work here. Most bands when they release their unleased work it truns out lame and bad work done on it, this album of unreleased by pealr jam might as well be another album to their collect of greatness what can you say about legends who keep on punching out work such as this album &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; without even trying?  Well simply put you cant, their music speaks for itself.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I purchased this album the day of release and am once again highly disappointed. Please note however, the two star rating is in relation to my expectations of Dream Theater and not in relation to the rest of popular music in general. In that case, sadly, it would have rated much higher.<BR>While there is no doubt that these guys have some serious chops, their highly regarded musicianship is what I call into question. With each album release since &quot;Awake&quot; their song writing skills seem to diminish even further. It's like listening to one incredibly technical solo after another. At times they even seem to be fighting each other for our attention with their own virtuosity.<BR>Another ever increasingly weak point is the lyrics. This bands two best lyricists were Kevin Moore and John Myung. Kevin is no longer with the band and John might get one song every other album. Quite a shame to ignore such a talent.<BR>If you are a fan of all of their work then this album probably will not disappoint. Go out and buy it. Despite it's clumsy lyrics (which actually seem to strive at pretense, yet fall short anyhow), it's tedious and overly monotonous song structure and lack of anything original musically, there is some tremendous playing going on.
B000003TA4|1.0|i mean i couldnt think of a more useless band and this is soposedly their peak? please if this is a bands peak they should have just quit before ever starting , yes i am a pearl jam alice in chains and soundgarden fan. But even though people classify nirvana with those bands of that era , talent wise nirvana is no where close all the other bands. Over all of the so called &quot; grunge&quot; era bands the overrated punk band as in nirvana gets blow away by the rest.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I saw Sarah perform first in a hotel bar in Sacramento back in 1995, and have seen her in a Lilith and on her own again since. I am a diehard fan, and it makes me a bit sad to play Afterglow and hear her beautiful voice layered under so much... other stuff. Horns, piano, production gimmicks, etc. I respect her right to evolve as an artist but I never thought her beautiful, beautiful voice would take the back seat to other aspects of the music.(I actually thought there was something wrong with my stereo and I pressed a few different buttons to check the SurroundSound feature, but it's true; her voice is way back in the mix on several tracks.) I guess the spare instrumentation of Surfacing and Fumbling really hit me in the heart more than I realized. As other reviewers have pointed out, 'Answer' and some others on Afterglow still contain that musical immediacy I've come to expect and to crave from Sarah, and the pop-py stuff is also growing on me, like 'Fallen.' I'll never not buy the woman's music, but I sure hope her producer Pierre showcases her voice--not 20 layers of effects--next time out. Because Sarah McLachlan needs no overdubbing, no nothing, to stun listeners with the beauty of her music.
B00005JMFI|4.0|Elf is a fun family movie that the entire family could really go do. Will Ferrell is great as the oversize elf who looks for the family he never knew and like all Xmas comedies, trouble always follows. James Caan also gives a good performance as well as Ed Asner and Bob Newhert. Take your kids and have a good time.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|Some people have hammered this release, I'm not. I am not a HUGE Bruce fan, but I like a solid collection. This CD has all the high points of his so far career. In my books I feel 4 KEY songs are missing: I'm Going Down-My Hometown-Ain't Got You &amp; Darlington County. My faves. But it serve's well for any old or new fan. As for Bruce being called a CASH COW releasing it at XMAS time. I feel it is unfair &amp; just to get more $$$. If you only bought a few of his LP'S as I did, but like a great overall collection... This is for you. This release is great, plus an added 3rd limited edition CD of unreleased live &amp; studio songs is included. More than I need, but more the better. A+
B0000VCZK2|5.0|How can a review be written on something not yet released?<BR>I own the Legacy box set on DVD so this is not the first time Aliens is on DVD as one reviewer wrote. I normally don't even bother with the reviews posted here but these got me going.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  It is full of emotion.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah's lyricism, voice and layered piano are in top form as she returns with her first studio CD in several years. The mixed early reviews Amazonians have given &quot;Afterglow,&quot; which has been out less than a week, may be due to the dark themes on the CD, which Sarah herself described in an interview as &quot;sad songs.&quot;  (Most all of the tracks were written before she had her first child two years ago, so don't expect any &quot;joys of motherhood&quot; pieces.)  The majority of themes revolve around deep, long- standing and mature relationships that have burned out or become unraveled.  Her lyrics are wonderful, dead-on emotional reckonings, but listeners who haven't had these life experiences yet (like this line from the track &quot;Time&quot;: &quot;If I agree well it's just to appease you/ 'cause I don't remember what we're fighting  for&quot;) may not appreciate the depth of this material. The CD is soulful and moving, one of the best CDs of 2003.
B0000C7GG2|4.0|If anyone out there is familiar with My Sweetheart the Drunk, you'll see that where Buckley was headed is what Muse increasingly have become.<br />I don't mean this in a bad way, but all of the people who think that these guys are brilliantly original, just haven't been listening to the right stuff.<br />Their time signatures are fun and their rythms nice and driving like J.B.'s and it doesn't hurt that their singer can do quite a few of the vocal acrobatics that Buckley is most revered for.<br />But again, these comparisons to radiohead are troubling.  I cannot understand them.<br />In some ways, Muse is what radiohead try so defiantly not to be... they are that spill your guts sing and play from the bottom of your soul sappy (and terribly adolescent) lyric screeching emotional roller coaster that Radiohead has spent their career trying not to turn into.<br />To compare this Bellamy kid to Yorke is a mite insulting to both.<BR>I don't think either one would want to be anything like the other.<br />Yorke is intellectual and thought provoking, Bellamy is emotive and gut wrenching... FAR more like Buckley.<br />That said, Buckley is perhaps one of the greatest vocal performers captured onto CD in the past 50 years.<br />Bellamy is a decent imitation and like I said reviewing another muse record... far better than the filth that starsailor (another in this vein) puts out.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Ive been a huge fan of AC/DC  for many years now and i have both dvds Stiff Upper Lip Live and No Bull, but i have to say this is by far the best in sound quality picture/ type of film used and the band in general. Angus is at his best.. he never misses a note except in one instance when the sound on his guitar flickers on and off for a few seconds in let there be rock.. but all around the band is great. The set list is great.The four tracks that stand out are Thunderstruck, Back in Black, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and Highway to Hell . The bonus features are great also . especially if youre a big fan. All around its a great buy i suggest you buy all three of the dvds they all have something good about each of them.  Buy This dvd now!
B00001SIES|3.0|Often Compared to Radiohead?  Why?  They sound nothing like Radiohead.<br />This is not a qualitative statement.  I'm not suggesting that they stink because they don't sound like radiohead.  It's an unfair comparison to make.  They really sound nothing like any stage in Radiohead's history.<br />They sound a bit like Jeff Buckley (only not as good) might have if he'd had a good band behind him.<br />Somewhere between Queens of The Stoneage and Klaus Nomi.<br />Go for it if you like loud and melodic at the same time.<br />If you're listening to a band like Thursday or Rooney, put your crap down and buy this, it's along those lines... but good and actually musical... after you buy it, go try to develop some taste for a change.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Ive been a big fan of the thunder from down under for years and i have both of their other two dvds.. No bull and Stif Upper lip Live. This dvd is better then both of them.. for the most part..<BR>Angus and his guitar sound great he never misses a note.. exept in Let there be rock when his guitar sound flickers on and off when hes doing a signature move.. The set list is great.  The four songs that are performed better then in the othere dvds are Thunderstruck, Back in Black, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, and Highway to Hell. The bonus features in this dvd are very interesting espacially if you are a die hard fan. The 5.1 audio mix is amazing i can even here the echos and such of the croud and amps making you feel like youre there at the concert.  If youre even a tiny bit of a fan buy this dvd.. if youre a huge fan buy all three of them!!!! Thats what i did!
B0000CFW87|5.0|With great anticipation of this album ever since his debut, there was a big risk of disappointment...I never thought that he could build on perfection, but Josh Groban did the impossible.  His new album is more mature, giving what Grobanites have come to expect and yet adds a bit more variety and stretches his vocal range...his strongest songs in my opinion are &quot;My Confession&quot;, &quot;Per Te&quot; and &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot;, but there is no denying the power of inspiration in his leadoff single &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (which it most certainly did!). All of his songs highlight this man's immense talent.  Thank you Josh, for sharing your amazing ability to inspire and to comfort...you truly are amazing!!!
B0000E1ALR|5.0|The key to this compilation is in the title.  Yes, there are omissions that for big Boss fans are obvious, but this is true of virtually any compilation.  It is essential in that the selection encompasses all of his albums and represents what those albums did when they were released.  For those who consider this release to be a sell-out, you should be ashamed of yourselves.  Its part of a Columbia series.  Besides, I'm sure Bruce is in pretty good standing down at the New Jersey State Bank.  Appreciate this for what it is, especially for those who are just discovering the Boss's music.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|Firstly, I love P!nk just as much as the next person. I mean come on, everybody loves a [seductress]. But this album left me rather cold. In P!nk's relentless attempt to have more \\"Fun\\" and be less \\"Whiney\\", she produced a very bland and vapid record. After a while, the songs just bleed into one \\"I'm-trying-so-hard-to-be-[bad]\\" song. And it only gets worse with every \\"F\\" word the artist continually shouts. Granted, I love a nice \\"F*ck\\" in my music. But after a while it just gets redundant and meaningless. Especially on the hidden track \\"Hooker\\". That song had no point except to be crude for the sake of being crude. One of my other major complaints are the lyrics. The lyrics lack emotion and depth. They just are what they are, unabashedly shallow \\"Fun\\". The only songs that really stand out on this record are the ballads. And even one of them sounds like something recycled from M!ssundaztood. Maybe it's just me, But \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\" sounds an awful lot like \\"Eventually\\". Another song that sounded all too familiar was \\"Waiting For Love\\". The music in the song sounds very similar to Christina Aguilera's \\"Make Over\\". And not to imply that 4 Non Blonde's own Linda Perry is running out of new ideas, but she did work with both singers on both tracks. The only songs that were actually a good effort, to me, are \\"Trouble\\" and \\"God Is A DJ\\". But like I said, the lack of lyrical effort still makes them less than stellar. So in conclusion, only buy this record if you're a major P!nk fan and have $...to blow...I guess that right there says it all. I miss the \\"Whiney\\" P!nk that was present on M!ssundaztood. Please come back to us.<br />Yours,<BR>...If you're desperate for your punk/pop fix, try Bif Naked's I Bificus instead. Otherwise buy some actual good music and pick up Sarah McLachlan's Afterglow, John Mayer's Heavier Things, or Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This collection of Pearl Jam spans from outtakes from 10, to unreleased rarities, to B-sides, to &quot;10 club&quot; Christmas singles.  You may have heard some of these songs live, but just wait until you hear the studio versions, you are in for a treat. I look at this collection as Pearl Jam's &quot;Greatest Hits You Never Heard&quot;.
B000002UR7|4.0|Radiohead = Creep in some minds of the masses. But this album was much more than it's hit song &quot;creep&quot;. This album was much more than another alternative album. This record defined the birth of Radiohead, a seed that was slowly growing it's way into the void of intelligent and ingenious music.<br />Pablo Honey is a VERY underrated album in my opinion, but that's what makes it so great. This album is trampled on and thrown down by so many critics (even fans of Radiohead themselves), but I love this album for its mere simplicity and the feeling that at the end of the day, no matter what Radiohead had accomplished, they were just a rock band.<br />Some of the songs such as &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Ripcord&quot; got you dancing around and nodding your head to the heavy riffs that Johnny, Ed, and Thom masterminded. Other songs such as &quot;Stop Whispering&quot;, &quot;Thinking About You&quot;, &quot;Vegetable&quot;, and &quot;Lurgee&quot; filled you with such emotion and sense of feeling. There is really not a bad song on this album. There's a few songs that don't shine as much as the others, but they're certainly listenable to say the least.<br />I think the reason that this album gets so much negative critisism is that it doesn't hold a light to their latter albums, which were nothing short of musical genius. Pablo Honey to me is an introduction to the musical stratum that would become a more informed, provocative, intelligent Radiohead.<br />Though this album is certainly no &quot;Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Pablo Honey is one of my favorite Radiohead albums, and with good reason. It's not as sophisticated as the band's latter albums, rather...simplified, it's just good music. Give it a chance.
B0000CFW87|5.0|That's the simple word to define what this CD is like - incredible. Josh's gift of singing is awe-inspiring. The music on this CD trancends to another level of music untouched before. I could have this CD playing all day and never, ever, get bored or skip over a song.<br />It, again, is wonderful to hear such powerful songs in other languages. French, Spanish, Italian - regardless of if you speak these languages, you know that the songs would not hold the same meaning in English. Awesome, awesome stuff.<br />Josh's vocal range is fully tested on this CD, ranging from extreme lows and highs, but always on perfect pitch. The background, whether guitar, piano, or orchestra, adds excitement and helps build the pieces to the extraordinary levels that they are at. <br />Josh's first CD is awesome, but this one has even surpassed that. Someone stated earlier that Josh was like &quot;nails on a chalkboard&quot;. This couldn't be more insanely wrong. It is like pure beauty. Get this CD, you will fall in love with it.
B00001MXXH|5.0|that you can watch over and over and not get sick of it.  Though there aren't many bonus features, it doesn't matter...The movie just rocks.  You really need to see the movie to appreciate what everyone is talking about.  So, this review probably will not help much, you just have to see it.
0553573403|5.0|After having finished a game of thrones, I sat dumbfounded. How could a book be so rich in detail and plot. I've also read the Robert Jordan series and despite being excellent, they are a bit tedious at times. But a game ofthrones is an adventire the whole way. The characters are so realistic that you grow to hate Joffrey and Cersei but almost fraternize with Jon Snow, Robb, Ned etc. I would recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy. I'm about to start the second one. Can't Wait!
B0000DJZA0|3.0|but, I'm getting there. Having listened, at the insistence of many who have hailed Coldplay and Radiohead as the salvation of Rock, I find myself still unconvinced. Radiohead continues to sound like early Pink Floyd with half the imagination, and Coldplay seems to lack that breakout soloist to really take their songs somewhere other.<BR>That said, this live disc moved me a lot closer to finding a reason to believe in CP. Or maybe it's just that I'm wondering if I can hear in Martin's voice how wonderful it must be to jump Gwyneth Paltrow. Lucky Dube. Anyway, both the DVD and the Cd, essentially the same stuff, present the band full of an intensity that delivers their songs with absolute conviction. Their hits (?) &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Rush of Blood&quot; are far more captivating live than in studio, and visually, the band gives it all they have. They're not Peter Gabriel, but can stand on a par with U2. Predictably, it starts with &quot;Politik&quot; and ends with &quot;Amsterdam,&quot; but between these two bookends the songs &quot;One I Love&quot; and &quot;See You Soon,&quot; are truly remarkable.<BR>I hope there is life beyond 2 CDs and a live document for this band because it sounds like there's something in there. Maybe it's just too much wishing for a British Invasion that sticks this time, instead of postures. Oasis was nothing more than Mott the Hoople without a sense of humour. I sincerely hope CP doesn't fall back into admiring its own knobs no matter who the movie stars are that fawn on them. But I can understand the rush of blood to the
B000002RXS|4.0|But not for the reasons you might think.  Ms. Callas actually has very little to do with why I like this particular 'Carmen'.  I have never been a Callas fan, nor do I particularly care for her singing.  Carmen is no exception.  Callas' voice was on the downward spiral when this recording was made and it shows.  She seems to strain noticeably at various points throughout.  Where this performance DOES excel, is in all other aspects; the orchestration, pacing and choral work is top notch.  Maestro Pretre turns in a find reading here and I particularly like Robert Massard.  I always thought he was sadly underrated.  The remastering of this recording helped it considerably, bringing out highlights unclear in the original issue.  This is a fine performance and works very well for an introduction to opera and to 'Carmen'.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|On the first page of the handsome booklet that accompanies this set, Bruce Springsteen notes the challenge of compiling a collection of his - or anyone's - 'best' songs. For one's favorite songs by any artist is a subjective opinion, having much to do with personal 'time and place' as with the music itself. That said, I think that &quot;Essential&quot; is a first-rate album of great Springsteen songs. No doubt that it leaves the door open for &quot;Essential Vol. 2&quot;, but even as it is it's a great collection. Granted, with an artist of Springsteen's talent, you can't really distill his best down to 2 or 3 discs - you really need to just listen to all the albums. <br />One of the greatest things about this set is the remastering - which makes much of the earlier material shine like new, and whets the appetite for newly remastered versions of the complete catalog. Even the &quot;Born to Run&quot; material sounds better than the remastered version Sony released about 15 years ago. And disc three has a nice selection of unreleased and live cuts plus several tracks that were previously available only on other soundtracks or collections.<br />As for those who think Bruce is just cashing in by releasing this record - my advice is: just don't buy it. Too few young artists today are making the kind of music that anyone would consider essential 30 years down the road. (The Essential Eminem? I just don't think so.) For that achievement alone, and the fact that for some people these songs still stand as among the best American music ever made, we should celebrate that Bruce is an artist who is still true to his ideals, and unlike so many in the public eye, is one person we can all look up to.
B00009TB5G|1.0|The two most painful movie-watching experiances I've had were sitting through Jackson's first two adaptations of the trilogy.  It's rather sad that Bakashi, with half the screen time to work with, was able to be more faithful in adapting JRRT's plot and dialogue for FotR.  Yet as horrific as Jackson's first movie was, his second was a crime against the soul of the book.<br />It's a shame that generations of people will be getting their first view of JRRT's work through Jackson's adaptations rather than the books and JRRT's own vision and words.<br />John
B00004RF97|5.0|They make few movies of the level of quality as &quot;The Philadelphia Story.&quot;  This movie is just full of life, good and bad.  Cary Grant, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn are a trifecta of astounding talent, and they blend together with ease and style.  Like real people, everyone has their faults and their strengths.  Everyone is right and wrong at the same time, in their own way.<br />The dialog is so amazing, you want to quote it at every opportunity, although your life probably doesn't provide the opportunity to drop these kinds of quotes.  The &quot;High Society&quot; at play, and the lowbrow crashers making their nickels and dimes all the while allowing their pretensions to art...this is great drama.<br />The DVD is not particularly exciting, and is a surprising let down for such an amazing film, however a film this great doesn't need extras.  The main course is filling enough.<br />Definitely something you will watch over and over again.  One of the best.
B00008O0WN|3.0|I am not a follower of the ST movies, so I found this movie to be rather boreing. Too much talking and the major fight sceen at the end was the typical, my battleship vs. your battleship situation.<br />Nice movie to rent, but if your not a fan...then don't buy it.
0345410025|5.0|This book definately requires work. It is a &quot;How To&quot; guide which will only be effective if the reader is committed to putting in the work of practicing the techniques explained. I think one of the most interesting aspects of this is that good memory, like many other things, can be a LEARNED skill.<br />  I found this book after searching specifically for a helpful one to improve my poor memory. In particular, I went from  being a very good law student who was a capable researcher and writer and preformed well on essay exams in school, and even won a competitive moot court competition based on advocacy skills, to a JD who failed the BAR Exam multiple times due to an inability to remember details and jargon.  After time with every legal  study aid possible, I turned to resources to improve my memory.  While I unfortunately can't yet say I have passed the BAR exam, I can say that I have noticed a significant improvement in my relationship with my husband and others as I have become more attentinve to remembering details and with the techniques in this book thus have become a more dependable person. In the past when he or anyone else asked me to do things, though I was well intentioned and sincere in my &quot;Yes&quot;, I had a serious problem with follow up due to inattentiveness and poor memory skills. This book was most helpful as an aid to overcoming those limitations and assisited me in becoming a more responsible and less absentminded irritating person to be around.<br /> As a serious, logical, pragmatic person, this book was helpful in specificallly giving me the prompt to think of silly associations with the specific intent of remembering items.  That would be something I wouldn't have ever  NATURALLY done on my own!  In discussing it with others I have found that many people ALREADY utilize many of the memory techniques described, and they were surprised these were new to me. This book is most helpful for those of us who just haven't gotton into those habits. As someone who NEVER could even remember any of those numonics throughout school it was a relief to discover that there are other techniques which are more effective for me.  The book also discusses how memory and intelligence are distinct, and that the problem of poor memory, and in particular absentmindedness is one of not being fully consious in the moment.  It is helpful in identifying the source of many memory problems is simply not being in the habit of focusing on the mundane with full attention. Making that ASSUMPTION that something is &quot;simple&quot;  and &quot;easy&quot; and therefore doesn't require much time and attention is a trap I more consiously avoid after employing the techniques of this book.  The disctinction between intellegence and memory is one which I feel is helpful as it validates those of us who have great capacity to understand things easily, but little capacity to recall. That distinction made me as reader feel more empowered to use memory as a TOOL, and I believe offers needed encouragement to anyone who has struggled in either work, school or their personal life due to poor memory skills.habits.

B0000C1HLF|4.0|A lot more unrealistic action sceens, and a whole lot more sexual situations. To quote Roger Ebert, I felt like I was watching a 2 hour long commercial for the Maxim magazine.<br />But since I had \\"expected\\" it to be ridiculus......I enjoyed it!!! <br />This is a good movie, but Charlies Angels part one had a much better storyline. If you can't afford to buy both, then purchase part one instead of part two.
B000002GZ1|4.0|Mientras los grupos Ingleses de mediados de los 60 redescubrían el blues y lo llevaban a grandes audiencias, al otro lado del Atlántico Paul Butterfield y su banda inician ya en forma definitiva el blues rock, dejando bien en claro el tema a los entusiastas jóvenes Ingleses.<br />Aunque no exactamente blues blanco (un tercio del grupo no lo es), las verdaderas estrellas son Butterfield y Bloomfield, que con 23 y 22 años más bien parecen veteranos maestros del blues que dos jovenes aprendices. Lo cierto es que el dominio y seguridad que muestra Butterfield tanto al canto como en la armónica están muy por encima de los típicos cantantes blancos de la época. Mención aparte merece Mike Bloomfield, quizás el guitarrista menos reconocido en la historia del rock. ni Clapton ni Beck tsonaban como Bloomfield en 1965, un guitarrista verdaderamente genial que en los instrumentales Thank You Mr. Poobah y Screamin' y en Blues With A Feeling muestra lo mejor de su talento. <br />Si John Mayall y compañía se llevaron el crédito en Inglaterra, Paul Butterfield y su banda (gran compañía también) merecen un destacado lugar en la historia por su enorme influencia en el desarrollo del blues y su variante más rock.
0792844890|5.0|I have no idea how the kid at the bottom can call this movie dumb and boring etc. and make fun of the kid who brought it over..this movie was HILARIOUS! at first i was tired and didnt feel like watching anything the first time i saw it then from the beginning writings it sounded good and for the rest of the movie i couldnt fall asleep i wasnt even tired anymore cuz i was laughing so hard! its an awesome movie i recommend it to everone!
0446677450|3.0|This is a very clever book that explains how to apply  financial management to an individual's personal budget. You don't need to know anything about finances to fully understand this book. This is probably why it has become a best seller. Because it is able to transfer knowledge to the masses and persuade them.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have been really excited about the new album and I finally have it. Here's my review of Sarah McLachlan's new album Afterglow. I have played it through now three times over (the first time on my headphones lying on my bed, and twice consecutively while I've worked around the house). <br />At just over 40 minutes it's short and sweet. In typical Sarah fashion the melodies are all very strong, and her voice is as impeccable as ever. <br />Producer Pierre Marchant does a fine job lending the album a lush and mellow sound. The music is very textured, but simple. There are no big productions, just minimal arrangements. Acoustic and electric guitar, piano, percussion and orchestration support the melodies and Sarah's vocals. All in all, this is an album that get's better with repeated listens. Each time I fell deeper into the music.<br />Of the ten songs, several stand out. Fallen is a song about failed relationships, and a ideal choice for the first single. Here Sarah shows just how well she can take a universal theme and make it personal. It also has one of the finest melodies on the album. <br />Many of the songs are about relationships. Over the past several years Sarah has been through a lot, from marriage and the loss of close friends, to the death of her mother and the birth of her daughter India (in the liner notes the albums dedication is to the two of them). As can be expected her writing is very emotional.<br />World on Fire is undoubtably Sarah's reaction to life in the post 9/11 world. Here is an exerpt:<br />&quot;Hearts break, hearts mend, love still hurts.<BR>Visions clash, planes crash, still there's talk of saving souls.<BR>Still cold is closing in on us.&quot;<br />Answer is my favourite song on the new album. Very simple, yet powerful. An example of how less can be more. I &quot;got all teary&quot; when I first heard this song. Yes lol, she does that to me. This is a song in the tradition of (now classics) like Angel and I Will Remeber You. <br />Perfect Girl is an incredible song about empowerment. Here's a sample:<br />&quot;Am I faithful, am I strong? Am I good enough to belong? <BR>In your reverie a perfect girl.<BR>Your vision of romance is cruel, and all along I played the fool.<BR>Expectations that bury me.&quot;<br />Push and Dirty Little secret are gorgeous as well. Simply put this album is full of personal, thoughtful and touching songs. My only dissapointment comes in that when it finishes it leaves you feeling like it's just begun, and after waiting six years for her return I wanted more.
B0000C9ZSV|4.0|Jimi Hendrix was and is the BEST at his craft of playing, or should I say, COMMANDING a guitar!  This is the best I've heard Jimi Hendrix play live!  I think it has something to do with the fact that he plays new material in this set that would eventually appear posthumously on the &quot;First Rays Of The New Rising Sun&quot; album that was first issued in 1997!  Hendrix said to his audiences who were yelling out requests during some of his concerts, Oh, you still want to hear that old stuff? and he went ahead and played his hits.  However, he was working on new material and wanted to play it live.  When he plays the new material it affects the whole performance with a welcome freshness!  I gave this album a 4 for two reasons: 1)because it should have included the first set and 2)because there is so much unreleased Hendrix material in the vaults that we haven't heard yet that a 5 should be reserved for the BEST live and studio recording!  While Jimi Hendrix only lived less than 16 weeks after this performance, we may not have heard his best live performance yet?!  Here's to the next live or studio recording from the Hendrix vaults!  Whether you're a fan or new to Hendrix live, TREAT YOURSELF TO THIS ALBUM!
B00007L4MJ|4.0|The saving grace of this version is that it attempts to restore the original vision of Fritz Lang. However, no version will ever be complete since so much of \\"Metropolis\\" ended up as scraps on the studio floor with numerous outtakes that will never see the light of day.  A good read is Thomas Elsaesser's book on the movie, published by BFI Film Classics.<br />What one marvels at is Lang's pyrotechnics, which were pretty amazing at the time.  The story itself is a rather poor one with over-the-top acting, which was the norm in the age of silent movies.  One had to try to connote as much as he could with facial expressions and body language.  It is really hard to figure out what all is going on in this movie.  But, it has been praised over the years for prophesizing the rise of Hitler.<br />The movie is ostensibly about a totalitarian state run by an industrialist, John Fredersen, who lives high atop a world built upon layers of society. His son, chasing after a lovely vixen, is made privy to this \\"underworld\\" and vows to destroy the great engine of this society, Moloch.  But, first he has to get past the evil scientist, Rothwang, who has made his love interest into a robot, which will supposedly placate the masses, which seem ready to revolt.  But, Lang didn't seem in control of his vision, as it spins violently out of control leaving as many questions as it does answers.<br />In its full-length version it is rather boring, and I found myself fast-forwarding through parts which seemed excrutiatingly long-winded.  Kind of like reading an Ayn Rand novel.  But, the cinematic vision of this futureworld is fantastic, drawing on some of the currents in Modern architecture at the time.  Lang's ideas seem to stem more from the rise of Socialism in Europe, than it did the rise of Fascism in Germany.  This seemed to be his greatest fear, although he knew to get out of town when Hitler came to power.  He politely refusing the Furer's offer to be the chief filmmaker of the Third Reich, and took the next ship to America, where he wasted away his remaining years in Hollywood.Reich, and took the next ship to America, where he wasted away his remaining years in Hollywood.
B000000W5F|5.0|Given that I'm a child of the 70s, not the 60s, I consider Tattoo You to be the Rolling Stones at their finest.  It sports the classic &quot;Start Me Up&quot; and the hit &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;, but also has quality cuts from start to finish.  There isn't a weak tune here. And while their earlier singles in the 60s &amp; 70s still get airtime, the albums they came from are still good, but sound dated.  &quot;Tattoo You&quot; still sounds fresh nearly 20 years later.<br />Of the other cuts, &quot;Hang Fire&quot; is one of my favorites - upbeat, catchy, great guitar work.  &quot;Neighbors&quot; and &quot;Little T&amp;A&quot; really rock with an almost punk influence.<br />Also of note is the fine production work and the recording quality which are today taken for granted.  Compared to even their 70s works, &quot;Tattoo You&quot; is their best to date.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is really fantastic, and my tastes run more to Alicia Keys, Lucinda Williams, and Erykah Badu than to Britney Spears.  Christina really breaks into the adult audience with this LP.  She has a fantastic, soulful voice, and I'm looking forward to more.
B000096I9G|5.0|An ok kiddie, this one is not for those not in the know.  If you don't own at least a 5.1 surround sound system, you WILL NOT enjoy this top-notch performance to it's fullest potential.  If you haven't \\"experienced\\" The Cure live, this is an excellent chance to do so.  The Pornography set can take us to some dark places, but that's not always a bad thing.  Uncle Robert is there to walk us through the scary \\"Siamese Twins\\" and lead us past that frightening image of \\"The Figurehead\\" and we can trust him right?  But wait, there's more.  You also get an electrifying performance of what is in many people consider the bands peak on the \\"Disintegration\\" set.  Unfortunately, I partied out a bit too much and missed the Bloodflowers set.  However, based on the two sets on the first DVD, I am looking forward to it.  Turn on, tune in, and drop out.<br />Timothy Leary-From Beyond
B0000E1ALR|4.0|I bought it because the sound is great. Everything's been remastered. But I kinda reget buying it because now Sony's next step will be to remaster Bruce's entire catalog forcing many of us to buy his stuff all over again. They did the same with Dylan; but man those discs sound incredible.<BR>Docked a notch for not having:<BR>Growing Up<BR>Candy's Room<BR>too many songs missing form Born in the USA<BR>Tenth Avenue Freeze Out<BR>Prove It All Night<BR>and so on...
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Wow....<BR>     I didn't know what to expect.  But with Pearl Jam, the quality of songwriting just doesn't fall off... the songs that didn't make it onto proper p.j. releases are sometimes so shockingly good, you wonder what they were smoking when they didn't put them on an album... but then, of course, you listen to the albums, and see that those decisions are sometimes very hard.  <br />     This two-disc set reminds me of Springsteen's &quot;Tracks,&quot; especially in the sense that (as Springsteen himself put it) sometimes the best songs &quot;get away&quot; without being represented on a proper release.  Here, though, these songs get the royal treatment - lovely packaging, with candid snipets in the liner notes about each song, some telling the back-story of the track, others relating why the song never made it on an album, etc.  <br />    The album works well, each of the two discs flowing well, like the songs were intended to be played in this order.  The first disc (roughly) is home to the more upbeat moments, and the second disc is full of the more somber and reflective songs.  And, because the material isn't arranged chronologically, its difficult to tell when a particular track may have been recorded.<br />     Brilliant stuff... If you're a pearl jam fan, you gotta have this.  Sure, there's &quot;Yellow Ledbetter,&quot; &quot;Footsteps,&quot; and &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, and other well-known non-album tracks, but the 27 or so other tracks are equally impressive.  Cudos to P.J.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|First off I wasn't a huge fan of Coldplay until I saw them live in September of last year in Boston.  They put on an incredible, energetic show that blew me away.  When this DVD came out I had heard Moses, the new single and was impressed so I bought it.  I have to say I ended up stay up WAY too late the night I bought it watching the whole concert and the Tour Diary.  I actually got goose bumps watching it.  This DVD/CD is worth every penny.
B0000AI45P|5.0|Marquee Moon often appears on many respectable top 50 CD lists, yet very few people have had the opprotunity to get lost within its grace. Two guitars playing totally different styles clash with the hi-hats of Billy Ficca and the bass of Fred Smith (Blondie). Tom Verlaine (Miller) delivers the crooning guitar solos while Richard Lloyd brings about the scalar runs and techinicality of the group.<br />Each song is a journey through heaven, hell, and everywhere in between. The dual guitars flow perfectly in each song. \\"See No Evil\\" opens the album up with an immediate array of talent. The solo blows me away each time. The way the guitars blend is just amazing. They make everything sound busy while keeping the music clean and easy to listen to. \\"Venus\\" has a killer chorus which is really just the guitar. The tone is so beautiful I feel like crying knowing I can't replicate it. \\"Friction\\" shows you the childlike humor this band has. Just like \\"Hard On Love\\" and \\"Love Comes In Spurts\\" which Television used to play when Richard Hell was the bassist, this song has a sexy type humor. After being knocked off your feet by the first three songs, you'll get kicked in the stomach by \\"Marquee Moon.\\" Verlaine's voice has such a wild ache in it, I'm constantly wondering how this band didn't make it big. \\"Marquee Moon\\" shows just how different Verlaine and Lloyd play. The first solo is a conventional rock solo, descending down scales. That would be Lloyd. The second one is a slow build up into a massive climax; Verlaine's masterpiece. The guitar longs for something that is unknown, just like his singing. If you were already knocked out cold by the album, the ending of the song revives you so you can bless your ears with the rest of the CD. \\"Elevation\\" would be the first dark song on the album. For lack of a better term, it's a rainy day song. Richard Lloyd's solo is flawless. \\"Guiding Light\\" is the exact inverse of \\"Elevation.\\" It's a ballad and is really a great contribution to thealbum. After hearing two songs which showed how diversified Television is, \\"Prove It\\" throws you back to the rock of \\"Friction.\\" It's a cult favorite and once you hear it, you'll know why. \\"Torn Curtain\\" is another downer. It's and extremly dark song. After this comes the extra tracks.<br />The extra tracks are pretty much a novelty sans \\"Little Johnny Jewel.\\" For some reason, Television never released this on an album. Anyway, when Johnny loses his senses, you better watch out. The epitome of Alternative music? I think so. <br />This album is, well, lanky. I'm sorry, but that word is just such a perfect word to describe the album. It's one of those things you have to hear. Do yourself and favor and drop the coporate stuff being shoved down your throat and listen to Television. One of the greatest punk bands, correction, one of the greatest bands of all time can not go without everyone hearing them at least once. If you like guitars, if you like Alt music, if you like to rock to something different yet familiar, Marquee Moon is just what you need.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Unrelenting. Intense. Blazing. Heavy. Energetic. Mind-boggling. Incredible. Balls. Chunk... Wow.<br />I could go on and on with the adjectives.. Suffice it to say that once Train of Thought starts.. it doesn't let up until the last note of the last track is played and it's over. Mind you.. that doesn't mean that they don't let you breathe (to refer to another fine DT song :-). No no.. there's plenty of melody to be heard and DT are in top form in that respect as well. But technicality and all-out balls-to-the-wall intensity is the water-mark Dream Theater clearly set for themselves for this release.. and MAN do they deliver.<br />Depending on which &quot;flavor&quot; of Dream Theater suits you (melodic, exploratory, heavy, grooving and so on), you may or may not like this album. For me.. I love pretty much everything they've done throughout their career.. and Train of Thought is no exception.<br />In my opinion, a worthy and lasting addition to any Dream Theater fan's collection. <br />To James LaBrie, Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci, John Myung, and Jordan Rudess: If you're reading this review: Bravo!
B000002UAR|5.0|This, to my knowledge is the first of it's kind..<BR>I love this album and his my favorite. I think that Revolver was a groudbreaking album. Revolver is a Citizen Kain but for music. It changed evrything for the Music industry creating this psychotic electric  sound of the mid sixties <BR>If you are looking for something original from the beatles I can very easly recommend this album. It's amazing.. I have most of the more popular Beatles CD's and this one is just great. Especially tracks like &quot;Tommorow never Knows&quot; or &quot;Taxman&quot;  If you are a fan of the Beatles this is an essential
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Probably the best song on this disk and one of all-time is &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; which is a haunting (maybe best) song by the Beach Boys, of all groups, lol.  It is played at the very end of the movie when most viewers are tearing up :)<br />Joni Mitchell also does a great &quot;Both Sides Now,&quot; one of the movie's best.<br />Kelly Clarkson is another highlight.  Her &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot; is the soundtrack song that is getting the most radio play at both Pop and Adult Contemporary stations.  It is played during the middle of the movie, then again after &quot;God Only Knows&quot; when the credits start (funny thing is that this song is on her solo album &quot;Thankful&quot; too, which is such a strong album, that this song was probably my 2nd least favorite) and works well with this movie.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|the voice is distinctly Sarah's......sweet and haunting and never over-induldged....BUT....the songs and the flow of the album and THE FEEL of the album are just......well...UNINSPIRED. i have tried to love it,....but i merely &quot;like&quot; it. i put the cd player on shuffle and as each song cued up i was dismayed at the &quot;similarity&quot; of vocal tone/pitch and verse/chorus/verse and tempo, etc. it's not BAD by any means,...but it just doesn't hold a candle to her masterpiece album &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;. it's PRETTY GOOD,...but a little &quot;flat&quot;. the tension and &quot;edge&quot; that made &quot;Fumbling&quot; so great are just not there. maybe it was inevitable. maybe it's just the result of age or financial gains. i don't know. a mediocre Sarah album is STILL better than a handful of most artists BEST work,....but...once you set the standard i guess it is HARD to duplicate. AGAIN,..not bad, not great,...just pretty good.
B00005RFAI|2.0|So is Pink rap or rock? It's curious how she all of a sudden changed her image from hip hop diva to rocker chick with an attitude when girls like Gwen Stephani were starting to become all the rage in pop music. Please no more manufactured pop stars!!!
B0000E1ALR|2.0|short &amp; sweet<br />  a SHAME to see this X-mas release, never thought I'd say it but I long for the days when I waited 2 years or longer for a release (besides it built on the anticipation and in turn the Joy of his Brill' earlier work)<br />  Three Hits/collection/compilation packages<br />  Is Bruce gathering as much wealth as possible for fear he will never have another &quot;Rising&quot; in him ?<br />  as I said<br />  A Shame........
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney is living proof that it doesnt matter how talentless you are. All you need is a record company with lots of cash , competent people behind you and a great pair of T&amp;A to become a pop star!! Britney I love you!!!
B00006V9A0|3.0|On the plus side: You Know You're Right is as good as anything Nirvana ever did and demands to be cranked. For this song alone, this is a must buy.<br /><br />On the minus side: the Scott Litt remix of Pennyroyal Tea did nothing for me, the In Utero version remains definitive.<br /><br />If you are a fan, you have all their albums anyway and this set is almost pointless. In the wise words of Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall, \\"Greatest hits albums are for housewives and little girls\\".
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I bought this album yesterday and let me assure you, it rocks!!!  \\"Try This\\" goes one better than her breakout hit, \\"Mizunderstood\\", by cranking up the energy and offering an eclectic mix of songs.  This is the kind of album that will make you want to drive down the streets in a convertible with the top down and a sweet moon howling above you!  The beats and riffs are fast and catchy as Pink veers effortlessly between pop and rock.  My stand out favorite tracks (though I love them all) are #3, \\"Last to Know\\": An in your face snarling anthem that will want to make you pump your fist in the air and shout, \\"Yeah!\\" [ #5: Is a deliscously sexy romp with underground star Peaches, # 10: Humble Neighborhoods has the best chorus since Pink Floyds \\"We don't need no education\\" and the hidden track \\"Hooker\\" is nothing less than awesome  (and honestly, all of the tracks are great).  This is one of those few albums that warrants spinning in your CD changer repeatedly without having to push the skip button.  Pink continues to burst genre barriers and offer the world a fresh voice as she shreds pop's current paper poser dolls, Hillary Duff, Jessica Simpson's et all in her path.  With \\"Try This\\", her third album, Pink definitively proves that she has the vision, the voice and the courage to be a trailblazer and that she is here to stay.   Pink is charting a bold course through the wake of past pop visionaries like Deborah Harry and Madonna.  She has earned the exclamation point in her name and then some!!!!! \\"Try This\\" album----you're gonna love it!
B00005JMFO|4.0|My rating is based on my enjoyment of this film. It has both major strengths and serious weaknesses, and as other reviews indicate has fostered very strong reactions, both positive and negative. Its format is somewhat disconcerting if you are not prepared for the methodology of the director. It contains nudity, profanity, sexual situations, and several situations that are very suggestive and some moviegoers may consider to border on the obscene. However, the situations that some people may consider offensive actually serve a purpose in developing the overall theme of the film.<br />Love, in all its manifestations - wonder, joy, pain, happiness, passion, grief... is the theme of the film. A very talented ensemble cast is utilized to tell several somewhat interrelated stories concerning the emotional lives of the various characters. The cast includes Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Kiera Knightley and Alan Rickman. There are also telling cameos by Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson. There is one other essential element of the story, it begins five weeks from Christmas and there are several aspects of the various vignettes where the seasonal aspect is a crucial element.<br /> One of the more interesting and complex stories involves Liam Neeson and his young stepson preparing for the funeral of his wife, which has been moving scripted by her prior to her death. As he subsequently tries to deal with his grief, he is worried about the fact that the boy is isolating himself in his room. He is surprised to discover that while his son is disconsolate at the loss of his mother, more importantly he is heartsick over his unrequited love for a girl with whom he attends school. As they concentrate on his son's dilemma and develop a plan to attract her attention, the dialog ranges from comic to quite profound. And, as the movie progresses to the time of the school Christmas pageant their story gradually becomes interwoven with several of the others. Some of the most hilarious segments are in another thread of the movie involving Bill Nighy as a washed up pop singer trying to recycle one of his old love songs as a Christmas record. He effectively caricatures the dissolute rockers who abused their bodies for too long with drugs, booze and sex. Yet in the end, the alternate humor and pathos of his situation are resolved in a very effective and quite emotional scene. In yet another thread, a scene with Emma Thompson listening to a Joni Mitchell recording and thinking about the \\"both sides\\" of her life and love is a real tearjerker.<br />So this is a roller coaster of laughs and cheap humor combined with real insights about love and the pain that it can cause. If you aren't living in a bubble, you will probably relate to the experiences of at least one of the characters to some degree and knowingly nod in recognition of the similarities of others to people that you know. It is arguable whether the message of the film would be better conveyed with a fewer number of stories examined in somewhat more depth, but I think the result is quite powerful. Lives which seem only tangentially connected turn out to have a profound influence on others, and we really feel that we have come to understand the characters that we have been watching.<br />My first difficulty with the movie is that the complexity of developing so many stories means that it is well over two hours long (with the previews and unconscionable ads we were in the theater for well over two hours). Second, the audience is introduced to a very large number of characters during a very short period of time, since all the stories are interspersed sequentially as the movie proceeds toward Christmas Day. Very few individual segments until the finale are more than three or four minutes in length. However, the disorientation that I felt at first from the constant scene shifts was offset by the fact that this technique was successful in keeping the audience very interested; the film actually seemed shorter than it was because of the constant action. So, it was fun while actually conveying a message at the same time. I also want to see it again, since this is the type of movie that I often enjoy more during subsequent viewings. I find that once I know the basic story line and the relationship of the various characters, I can then pay attention to a lot of the details that went were difficult to appreciate because there was so much constantly happening during the film. (In fact, as I was thinking about the film prior to writing this review a few such instances came to mind.) So, go see this film when you have time to relax and want to laugh and contemplate life for a few hours.<br />Tucker Andersen
B0000CFW87|5.0|This cd is one of the best that I own.  Such songs as &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot;, &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; and &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; are beautifully arranged and go so well with his amazing vocal talent.  I'm usually not one for songs in languages I don't know, but such ones as &quot;Oceano&quot; just give me the chills listening to it....I can't wait for more!!!!!
B00005JMFO|5.0|My friend begged me to go see this \\"feel good\\" movie when I was down. I was skeptic at first, but I ended up LOVING IT. There are so many different characters that you just fall in love with. They are all searching for the same thing: love and to be loved. Their journeys are relatable and touching. There's a great Hugh Grant scene where he's dancing to a song (it will have you on the floor laughing!). The movie is hopeful, funny, and might even make you cry. I recommend this movie to anyone: single, married, divorced, whatever! It will make you hopeful about love and it's possibilities! PS. The movie has an AMAZING soundtrack!! I recommend buying that too!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Well, this is by far the heaviest CD from Dream Theater.  However, Dream Theater fans, don't worry, because it is not at all lacking in musicianship.  Then again, Dream Theater fans already know that, because we all already have the CD, because we don't buy music according to what crap is popular on the radio.  Anyone else, not yet a DT fan, buy the CD, sit down, forget what you know about simplicity and dancability, and prepare for a thorough @ss-kicking Dream Theater style!! OH YEEEEEAAHHHHHHH!!!!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Wow, a great soundtrack to an even greater movie! What could be better? I bought this CD minutes after I saw the movie and I love it! The music in the movie is so different. Some of it contempary, some old, but all wonderful!<br />1. &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot; (Kelly Clarkson): An amazing love ballad with great vocals.<br />2. &quot;Here With Me&quot; (Dido): Touching song that plays during a great scene in the movie.<br />3. &quot;Sweetest Goodbye/Sunday Morning&quot; (Maroon 5): This is a superb new band with a unique sound.<br />4. &quot;Turn Me On&quot; (Norah Jones): This song is GORGEOUS! Norah's voice is pure bliss. This song is so blunt and beautiful. &quot;I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home and turn me on.&quot;<br />5. &quot;Take Me As I Am&quot; (Wyclef Jean feat. Sharissa): Cute little love song, funky beat.<br />6. &quot;Songbird&quot; (Eva Cassidy): slow sweet love song.<br />7. &quot;Wherever You Will Go&quot; (The Calling): Amazing smash hit that moves you!<br />8. &quot;Jump (for my love)&quot; (The Pointer Sisters): This is the song in the movie that Hugh Grant dances to and it makes me laugh when I hear the song. :)<br />9. &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; (Joni Mitchell): Great pretty song. This song plays during an emotional scene in the movie.<br />10. &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; (Lynden David Hall): CLASSIC SONG. Sung beautifully and makes you feel good.<br />11. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; (The Beach Boys): Another classic tune that brings back memories.<br />12. &quot;I'll See It Through&quot; (Texas): Okay song.<br />13. &quot;Too Lost In You&quot; (Sugarbabes): Neat sound, sounds like a cross between Sade and Pink.<br />14. &quot;Glasgow Love Theme&quot; (Craig Armstrong): Theme song of the movie. It's just a piano playing, but it sounds beautiful.<br />BONUS TRACKS!!!!!<br />15. &quot;White Christmas&quot; (Otis Redding): CLASSIC Christmas song with that great Otis Redding sound.<br />16. &quot;Christmas Is All Around Me&quot;(Billy Mack): This song plays several times during the movie and it's such a funny/cute song and you'll see why when you view the movie.<br />17. &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; (Olivia Olson): This young girl sings this Mariah Carey classic tune during the movie and it's such a cute scene. She has an angelic voice.<br />All in all, AMAZING soundtrack, do not miss out on these great songs! Make sure you get the cd that includes the bonus tracks. :)und Me&quot;(Billy Mack): This song plays several times during the movie and it's such a funny/cute song and you'll see why when you view the movie.<br />17. &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; (Olivia Olson): This young girl sings this Mariah Carey classic tune during the movie and it's such a cute scene.

0671027344|3.0|Most teenage readers will undoubtably like this book--a lot.  It resonates very strongly with the teenager who, like this book's protagonist, is angsty.  That's not an inherently bad thing.  This book reads very quickly, and I admit that I too enjoyed almost all of it.  It's full of so many universal teenage situations, that I couldn't help but to apply it to my own life.  That's a kind way of saying that this book is very trite.  <br />Chbosky plays with a particular image of the teenage years, and it just so happens that this image revolves very much around pop culture--especially music.  It's really no wonder why MTV selected it for publication:  It reads like a really long advertisement for the teenage, MTV-style archetype, and it's highly romanticized.  Chbosky knows that in the 90s music world, anybody who's anybody listened to Nirvana, and if they didn't, they wish they had.  I suppose the reader is supposed to feel a connection to the story's characters because they all listened to the same music.<br />All-in-all, this book is often moving, in it's own overdramatic way, but it's nothing special.  The letter format that Chbosky follows is just a device, used--again--to make the story seem applicable directly to the reader.  The ending is a let down.  In short, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is highly overrated.  But hey, everyone's already read it, and in order to fit in, you should too (and listen to Nirvana, and watch MTV, and...).  It is, for what it's worth, a relatively accurate (though very stylized and oversimplified) look at the teenage years in the 1990s.  It's anything but a masterpiece, but many teenage readers will think it's the greatest book ever written.
B000089RVR|4.0|Although I liked her &quot;No Angel&quot; album better, &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is pretty good. Her voice is subdued and airy and aside from the hit single, &quot;White Flag&quot;, I loved &quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot;...It has a bluesy/jazz element to it and is very sensual. The beats in all her songs are great and her music is enjoyably minimalistic. She proves that sometimes less is more. A great singer and a great album!
B00005JM0B|1.0|The original Terminator was great a true classic, everything you could ask for in a movie.  T2 was boring, way too long a rehash of the original with better special effects minus the violence.  T3 is the worst movie of all time along side 28 Days Later, this is a rehash of T2 which was a rehash of T1.  T2 the violence was watered down T3 is a joke (I've seen more action packed violent episodes of Scooby Doo).  Who are these teens writing great reviews for a poor movie, they weren't even a itch in the papa's Trousers when the original was released.  Give this one miss boyz because it's definitely for the Girls.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was never a fan of Christina Aguilera back when she was singing \\"Genie in a Bottle\\". Back then I had no idea just how much talent she had because her songs never showed it. Well, the exception was \\"Obvious\\" and \\"I Turn to You\\" on her other album, but the rest was just the same old, same old.<br />When her new album, \\"Stripped\\", came out, I decided to check it out and give her another chance. WOW! What I heard SHOCKED me (in a good way)! Christina is oozing with vocal talent and on this album, it really comes across. I cannot believe she didn't let it out earlier! How did she manage to bottle up all that talent without letting the genie out??? All the songs on this album I find myself constantly humming in my head. She has a lot of positive messages (\\"A Voice Within\\", \\"Soar\\"), personal emotions on display (\\"I'm OK\\", \\"Cruz\\") and many with catchy beats (\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"). Also, on this album she really showcases her incredible vocal range. I feel as though Christina is now being her true self. Her songs have become more personal and there are deeper messages in her lyrics. I love her new comeback (if you want to call it a comeback) and her new image. Christina Aguilera was put on this earth to sing her brains out!!!!!! It's just too bad that she uses cheap gimmicks (i.e. selling sex) to showcase her work. I feel that if she toned down the overbearing sexual image she's promoting, she would sell more albums, people would be listening to her MUSIC, and she would gain the respect she truly deserves.<br />Even if you thought you never liked Christina, give her one more shot with this album and you will be blown away with this singing sensation!
B0000AM6JI|5.0|This is a great movie, just as good as scarface.  The story is superb, acting is great and characters are interesting.  This movie will keep you hooked from start to finish.  Al Pacino at his best, alongside Sean Penn, really great performances.  Brian DePalma's last great movie, the only flaw is the DVD not enough extras but an all round great movie.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne took the world by storm and some people are jealous and upset. Yes, I know her music is pop and that she's in fact NOT a skater or a punk. So what? When I bought this CD in June when it was first released, I didn't care whether or not she was a punk or a poser or whatever! Now people make such a big deal about that trivial issue and they forget to listen to the MUSIC and let the MUSIC do the talking. If you like her music, people automatically think YOU think she's a punk and that you don't know real punk music when you hear it....OR....they think that you got suckered into the whole punk fashion craze. Well, all that isn't true. So now with that aside, let me review her MUSIC....You can think whatever you want about her IMAGE.<br />1. Losing Grip - This song is very catchy, has a great strong melody and thought-provoking lyrics (4/5)<br />2. Complicated - This song was butchered on the radio so much that it would make anyone sick (even her fans...haha), but when I first heard it, I loved it. (5/5)<br />3. Sk8er Boi - Extremely TERRIBLE lyrics, however, the melody is catchy (2/5)<br />4. I'm With You - I didn't care for this song at all. People say that the message behind the lyrics is deep, but I just think it's a snooze. (1/5)<br />5. Mobile - This song is very POP-ish and is a great song to sing along to... (3/5)<br />6. Unwanted - Everyone can relate to this song (at least I know I do!) and I really like the melody. (5/5)<br />7. Tomorrow - This is a subdued tune on her album with a more mellow aura...Avril's voice sounds very pretty on this track and the lyrics are quite mature. (5/5)<br />8. Anything But Ordinary - I LOVE this song...It's about wanting to push the limits and be wild and different. I especially love it when Avril hits those really high notes. (5/5)<br />9. Things I'll Never Say - I hated this song...The lyrics are plain, blah, and sound as though they were written down quickly without much thought and in return, it doesn't provokemuch thought from listeners. (1/5)<br />10. My World - This song tells us a little about her personal life (where she grew up, where she worked). The lyrics and the melody did NOTHING for me and I found it quite boring. This track seemed like a filler for the album. (1/5)<br />11. Nobody's Fool - I hated this song as well...haha, Avril should NOT try to rap OR if she DOES try again to rap, at least do it with some worthwhile lyrics! Rapping does NOTHING for her voice or for us. Avril's voice is more suitable for pop or pop-rock and she should stick to it, because quite honestly, her voice isn't that flexible. (1/5)<br />12. Too Much To Ask - This is one of my favourite tracks off the album. Her voice suits it perfectly and I can really relate to the melancholy message. (5/5)<br />13. Naked - Avril's voice is amazing on this track and the message is quite profound (whether or not it was intended, that's the way I interpreted it). This is also one of my favourite tracks. (5/5)<br />14. Complicated (The Matrix Mix) (Bonus Track) - This sounds EXACTLY the same as the regular &quot;Complicated&quot; version, so...I don't know what the point of this one was...The rating for this one will be the same as above (5/5)<br />I'm curious as to what Avril's second album will be like......She's got my interest. Sure Avril's vocal range isn't mind-blowing nor are her lyrics incredibly deep, BUT, she is definitely an artist to follow in the music industry.
B00008PC2O|1.0|Boy was this movie a stinker a Terminator who understands human feelings and emotion, what's next a Terminator Marry Poppins.  This was a sad movie all the greatness of the original destroyed by a gutless machine.  Why oh Why did that fool have to make such an un-violent, way too long boring movie, nothing in this compares to the original.  The action sequences try to be big but fail, the T1000 looks like a skinny boy (boy was he scary) and the T100 is now fearful killing machine.  Give this one a miss, p.s. T3 is even worse.
B000069AUI|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this group! They always churn out catchy mellow tunes. Every song on this album makes the listener think deeper. The lyrics contain wonderful messages. My favourites are &quot;In My Place&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, and &quot;Green Eyes&quot; (the latter which is incredibly romantic and I get chills when the lead singer hits that long note - God, I love his voice!) This album takes off from where &quot;Parachutes&quot; ended. Chances are, if you liked their first CD, you'll also like their second. The whole group is talented and I can't wait for their next album!
0812550706|5.0|Ender Wiggin is six years old, and he's probably smarter than most adults. So the government chooses him as one of the children to be sent off to Battle School in outer space, where they stage &quot;battles&quot; in order to pick out military genuises to defeat the buggers in the next &quot;Bugger War&quot;, in attempts to save mankind. A true page turner, Ender's Game kept me reading 24/7. OSC, without doing the whole &quot;pity my character&quot; thing, creates a character that you can sympathize with, in a setting that, unlike many sci fi books, seems realistic. No amazing gadgets that can't be explained, etc. A main character who's a genuis can only be as smart as the author who's writting it. OSC is obviously one of the most intellegent writers alive.
B00005JMFR|2.0|okay.. this movie was a MAJOR disappointment.  Here are my complaints:<br />1. Where is the philosophical issues dealt with thru matrix and matrix reloaded?<br />2. Having a massive war scene and leaving out Neo and Trinity for about 40 minutes was completely stupid. I sat there wondering what was happening to them.<br />3. It completely lost the cold hard edge the first matrix had.<br />4. I feel they should have done more with the train guy, and how you can get stuck between the matrix and the real world.<br />5. Needed more guns.<br />6. The big fight scene at the end... there was nothing new, except for the stupid air bit. how stupid.<br />7. Movie overall was too fragmented, didnt have a flowing story line, and was more of a romance then a philosophical movie. ... nuff said.
B00000K19E|3.0|This film is clearly revolutionary to the action and sci-fi genres.  In the fairly short time since it has come out, almost all action films have been painted against it.  The groundbreaking special effects have brought the expectations of the viewing public up to new levels.  With the genre-forming load that it carries, how it is that such a film fails to garner a perfect review?  The answer can be found following.<BR> Gore Vidal is undoubtedly a very intelligent man, a gifted writer, and man of excellent reason.  So why is it that many people can't stand him?  Three words: pretentiousness and condescension.  He can come across in his efforts as arbitrarily elitist and superior.  However, his talents are not in question, merely his presentation.  The problem with The Matrix is somewhat similar with an important difference.  The philosophy behind the film is never defined to any extent.  What little clarity that comes through is just plain silly.  However, the Wachowski's have managed to keep the pretentiousness that many find to be a flaw in Vidal's works.  So what you're left with is a condescending idea filled with mystical mumbo-jumbo without the solid theme to back it up.  There is nothing of value behind the excellent special effects.  The story and character developments are fun but not original.  The &quot;science&quot; in the film is pure drivel.  Human being as batteries?  Physical slavery would make a bit more sense but the scientific basis for using humans as a source of heat or electrical energy reaches the very peaks of absurdity.  &quot;Near the earth's core where it's still warm&quot;?!?!?!?!?  Not only is it still warm there but all known metals would liquefy before making it through the mantle!  Ok so it's future metal.  But the humans must have a way of withstanding heat that would melt steel.  There is no scientific basis for any aspects of the film.<BR> If one wants to learn about the existentialist-ish ideas underneath what little amount of coherency in the plot there is, read Sartre.  The fact that this adapts in some many ways Christian prophecy (The one.  The return of the one.) further undermines the existential underpinnings of the film.  Goofy musings on the nature of reality are the work of junior high philosophy buffs, and not particularly bright ones.<BR> The dialogue in the film is normally nothing short of stupid.  The only exception being the outstanding performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith whose dry, sneering delivery steals all the best scenes of the film.  Laurence Fishburne, an undeniably talented actor, is saddled with most of the nonsensical soliloquies.  Filling out the cast are a somehow-bordering-on-competent Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano.  All put in solid enough performance but none redeem the plot.<BR> So then remain the special effects.  They are beyond reproach.  They set the standards for all ensuing films that aspire to have effects of any kind.  The film has spawned numerous knock-offs, both serious and parodying.  The better of those keep to just the effects with the lesser trying to pick off bits of the plot.  All in all, it's an entertaining action film that aspires for being something more and fails miserably.  After all, it's kind of hard to love the ideas behind the film when the machines are so much more amusing than the humans.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Truly a great album that includes music from each phase of the bands' inspiring career. It's a that shame that other bands' fans still live in 1994. If I were a lead singer and had fans like that, I don't know if I would still be around today either. I would recommend putting down that hatorade, and picking up some good music.
B00005JMFR|3.0|A film by the Wachowski Brothers<br />I had thought that the Matrix trilogy was actually going somewhere, that there would be some sort of resolution, some real change in the world we are presented.  Unfortunately, there was not, and my disappointment in the conclusion to the trilogy magnifies any other flaw in Revolutions which I would normally have overlooked with a more satisfying ending.  I walked out of the theater thinking, \\"that was it?\\".  The promise of the Matrix was a big payoff to the hype and a big payoff to the story.  Neither was delivered.<br />When the movie begins, we know that we are closing in on the end to the final chapter of the Matrix.  The machines are only hours away from Zion and the final battle of the war is at hand.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) is unconscious and is lost between the Matrix and the real world.  When we last saw Neo, he was in the real world but was able to stop sentinels with the force of his will (as he is able to do with bullets when he is in the matrix).  The energy required to do this is the reason why he is unconscious now.  Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) fight to free Neo from this odd in between area which resembles a train station, a train station from which Neo cannot free himself.  Eventually Neo is freed and we enter the final stages of the war.  Neo decides to personally take the fight to the Machine City while the freed humans fight to keep Zion free.<br />What more do you really need to know?  We have scenes with the Oracle (Mary Alice, replacing the recently deceased Gloria Foster), and Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is also back.  Surprisingly, the character with the most humanity is Agent Smith.  Smith is, of course, a program in the Matrix.  He is less real than most of the other characters in the movie, but yet he is more compelling and he felt more human.  The fight sequences are, of course, well done.  Neo's battle with Agent Smith near the end of the movie is probably their best fight since the first movie (the subway scene), and this may be because, in part, the end is uncertain.  Because of the overwhelming odds stacked up against the humans, and because of how powerful Agent Smith has become, all of Neo's vaunted powers no longer seem to be enough.  Part of my complaint against the second movie was that we never believed that Neo could lose.  This is no longer true, and I feel the movie is stronger because of that.<br />I have heard complaints about various things throughout the movie, but even though I wasn't blown away, I had no problem with the first 90% of the movie.  I wasn't overly impressed, but I had no problem with it.  Unfortunately, in my view, the entire movie was undermined by the ending.  Sure, the action was good and I even enjoyed the big battle scene in Zion, but the ending left me unsatisfied.  With all of the questions raised by the first two movies (especially the first movie), the ending didn't really answer any of them.  The ending also didn't resolve anything.  The third movie of a trilogy has somewhat of a storytelling obligation to end the story.  Maybe the point the Wachowski's were trying to make was that there is no end to the story, but if that's the case it feels like more of a cop-out than a success.  All of the time and energy expended in three movies gets us to a point that is not significantly different than that from which we began the journey.  This is a movie which the more I think about it, the less impressed I am with what I saw.  It was just a very unsatisfying ending to a trilogy that had such potential and that promised so much.

B00005JMFR|5.0|I was completely impressed by this movie. It was unbelievable, and I'm not sure why the reviews are so bad. Oh well. I thought it was great. I left the theaters, changed, and somehow, compelled to do something. It was a powerful movie of the beauty of humanity, and the beauty of defeat. I was very happy with this trilogy. Check out this site: [...]%20Matrix.htm<br />It explains everything... and I asure you that you will think twice before you say that the Matrix: Revolution was a bad movie...<br />Love,<BR>Travis.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Watching the video extras that came with the CD shows us why this ablum is so boring.  Dream Theater is actually not a band, they are a Pettrucci-Portnoy duo.  These guys know nothing about teamwork.  Watching Mike &quot;command&quot; Jordan to shorten his appreggio in &quot;The Making of ToT&quot; really bothers me.  In my opinion, they should utilize the creative powers of the rest of the band to bring new life into their sound, and have someone external from the band do the producing.  Maybe they should take a corporate class on basic teamwork skills.<br />There is really nothing new on this album... just a bunch of random guitar chops from a guy who listened to way too much 80's metal and a drummer who prayed to Neil Peart.  The best track is &quot;As I Am&quot; because it doesn't contain huge amounts of over-indulgent and pretentious guitar playing.  It also contains the most memorable part of the album when LaBrie actually spits out a curse word.  The instrumental &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; is also good because it actually slows the pace down a little.  <br />Maybe I am getting old, but listening to 70 minutes of high-end guitar riffs with no cohesive song structure gives me a headache.  I think my brother puts it the best by calling DT &quot;video game music.&quot; I think they really need Kevin Moore back.  <br />The songs don't incite any kind of emotion whatsoever, except for the instrumental.  For example, listening to Disturbed's &quot;Liberate&quot; makes me angry at narrow minded people, King Crimson's &quot;Red&quot; makes me feel like I'm driving a car really fast.  ToT shows how amazing these guys are at re-hashing lines from 80's metal and putting them together in very small disjoint pieces.  But I really don't &quot;get&quot; anything out of the album.  I guess I just have to accept the fact that DT is just a jam band with no regard for music composition.  They would be fun to see live though.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|First of all,i am the most devoted enigma fan ever in this world,and secondly,i am so much disappointed.<BR>I don't know where that Enigma has gone that produce beautiful songs like Age of Loneliness,Beyond the Invisible,Shadows in Silence,Traces(light &amp; weight),Principles of Lust.<BR>Instead of that there is another Enigma which sounds like chemical brothers or moby or Orb or like any ordinary dance/techno group out there.I don't know what came over M Cretu but this album was not what i thought it would be.<BR>I understand that change is important but this is no change,it is the death of Enigmatism,it is the end of a musical era.<BR>I am so much depressed at this.<BR>I can understand those people who are still praising this album are those who listen to all kind of music,like they would listen to Enigma and then Metallica and Mariah Carey and n'sync and all other crap bands like them,so its nothing for them,they liked silly songs like &quot;boum boum&quot; with the cheapest lyrics ever by M Cretu,because they are used to these kinds of immature songs,but for a devoted new age,ethnic fusion or world beat fan this album is a huge disappointment.<BR>Enigma has sold out,this is a complete commercial album to attract immature listeners.<BR>I have bought this album,and i am not mourning over the money,i just want the REAL Enigma back not my money.<BR>I wish Enigma6 will be a return journey to the original roots,although i'll have to wait another 3 years for that.<BR>May God show M Cretu the right way.
B00000633U|5.0|Although this album is only his second, Richard Marx has revolutioned the way people think about music. He has combined Rock, Pop, and R&amp;B music into one album that's sure to make you say, &quot;This is Richard Marx?&quot; (although his first album may make you think that as well). When I first listened to this album, I didn't know what to expect. I had listened to his Greatest Hits album and his first album, being &quot;Satisfied&quot; that he was truly, a great songwriter, as well as singer. After listening to this album, I really got into the songs that Richard Marx had written. I could relate to many of them and they became my personal favorites. Even though I ahve pretty much worn out the cd, I keep buying new copies of it because I love the music, the way it is written, and most of all, the fifth song on the cd. This song is called  &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; and it was a major hit. This was the only song I knew before I became interested in Richard Marx and his music. It is my favorite song of all time, and, I think, the most beautiful song ever written. So, if you like a little variety, maybe songs that you can relate to, listen to this album. It's one experience you never forget.
B0000CFW87|5.0|As always Josh Groban does not disapoint.  This cd is better than the first if that is even possible.  This is one of those rare cd's that I don't find myself skipping any of the songs. I listen to it beginning to end.  Several songs have a great sweeping score that only enhances Josh's voice and doesn't draw away from it.  It is rare for songs to give you chills, but these definetely do.  Also, Josh's voice has matured and he reaches notes he strained to hit before. The only song that I wasn't found of was Broken Vow, which sounds much better on the previously released live cd. And in response to the previous review, Russel Watson cannot compare to Josh Groban. Although he has a beautiful opera voice, his regular singing voice is more irritating than anything else.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|this soundtrack is the best i've heard in while. i was a little upset that they did not include many of the christmas songs that were featuted in the movie, but it is a great compilation of songs :)
B000003KCU|1.0|I found this movie to be a big waste of my time and money.  Silly nonsense and stupidity abound.  I recommend this movie to those who are only stuck in the eighties, who probably would find &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; to be five stars as well.  There are way better family movies out there than &quot;The Explorers&quot;.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Interpol has snuck in under the radar with TOTBL and in many ways deserve some of the praise they get. I tell you it's better that they emulate the Post-Punk late 70's and 80's than be just another of the mindless rock/rap or mall/punk combo's out there. <br />In my opinion they've done a fantastic job of taking the sounds of Joy Division, Echo and the Bunneymen, The Smiths, Psychedelic Furs, Kitchens of Distinction, The Cure, and mixing it up with My Garbage Can, The Slime in My Septic Tank, Doggy-Doo on my Shoe, Ancient Leftovers in the Fridge, A Ball of Twine, and Roadkill. They've come up with something unusually complementary yet horribly bad. The derivative, contrite, boring, repetitive, unimaginative and utterly thoughtless sounds they've discovered have been thrust into the ears of the listening public and no Q-Tip can get them out. The baseball cap crowd will soon chase the vultures away and successfully resuscitate the lifeless corpse of Interpol. They will be huge I say. HUGE. Remember when only a few people really liked Nine Inch Nails? Then all the Neanderthal Meatheads came along and ruined NIN for years. You see that's kind of what will probably happen to Interpol. But instead of a really great band getting overexposed it'll be these horrible wankers being praised to the roof by young boys who need to cover their empty skulls with baseball caps and drink mass quantities of beer to compensate for not having a single individual thought for themselves.  <br />Interpol are one of the most boring, unimaginative bands to come along in the past week and because most young kids spend no time whatsoever looking into the past to better understand the present or future, we'll be bombarded by them by the radio stations and major labels till even their most passionate fans rue the day they'd ever heard of Interpol and they'll go the way of Hootie and the Blowfish. A once hugely popular band that have sunk so far into the pantheon of overplayed pop that no-one willadmit to ever having liked them in the 1st place. That, my dear readers is what makes Interpol so bad. They'll never make it in the long run. Even if they had talent, these are the days of use and abuse by the labels and virtually no one has a chance of ending up standing on their own 2 feet after the storm has died and gone.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|At first listen, I thought this album reminded me of another work, yet I couldn't figure it out.  I knew it wasn't a previous DT album, but I knew it was something I was very familiar with.  About halfway through the second listen, I finally figured it out, it sounds like Metallica's 'Master of Puppets'.  I know some of you won't agree with me, but I assure you the similiarities are there.  Of course these similiarites work both in DT's favor and also as a problem.  Whether you think these points help or hurt the record is up to you.<br />  Dream Theater's obvious mimic of the metal classic is prevelent in a few areas.  First, the instrumental song on the album seems to have an 'Orion' type style.  It starts with a riff, variations are created on it, it moves onto a new riff, variations occur and so on until the end of the song.  Now that sounds boring but I assure you they do it just as well as if not better than Metallica did (which is not easy).  But this is different then the past few Dream Theater albums in which the progression was much more sporadic, generally only staying on one idea for a very short amount of time, as heard in 'Glass Prison'.  This is not just in the instrumental, but is a theme throughout the recording.  The other Metallica-type part of this album is the distortion.  The first thing that tipped me off was the very first riff on the first song, which sounded much like something off of &quot;Master of Puppets' or 'Ride the Lightning'.  This style of distortion comes in and out of the entire album, but is an obvious theme.<br /><br />  The rest of the music proves this is definetely a Dream Theater record.  All of the songs except one break the ten minute barrier, and they never really get boring.  The solos seem to be the best they have been since 'Scenes from a Memory' and they are as long as ever.  The interaction between Jordan and John attracts your attention most, notibly (noteably?) during the lengthy solos.  As always, Mike Portnoy's drumming is absolutely mind blowing as well as Myung's bass playing. The difference I hear is that the bass riffs seem to be much more noticeable in this record.  Where on previos records he was either blowing you away or you couldn't really hear him, the bass is a staple to each and every song.  The virtuosic tendencies were kept low key to add to the songs. But let me add that Myung is still phenomenal throughout the entire effort.<br /><br /> The weakest part of the album, I believe, is the lyrics.  While they are just as catchy as ever, not a single song on the entire recording seems to really mean much.  While some of the subjects are religion, neglectful parents, and pessimism, they still don't seem to jump out at you.  They are definetely lacking from &quot;Six Degrees...&quot; or &quot;The Great Debate&quot;.<br /><br />  Overall, 'Train of Thought' is a soild album.  While it sounds a lot like mid-80s Metallica, it is still definetely a Dream Theater album.  Hardcore fans will enjoy the musicianship and the not-so-hardcore will like the more straightforward style compared to the two previous albums.  Even though I would not consider this a masterpiece like &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; or &quot;Six Degrees...&quot; I would rank it up with &quot;Awake&quot; in terms of replay value.y's drumming is absolutely mind blowing as well as Myung's bass playing.

B00004NJJQ|4.0|\\"Seventeen and nature's queen/You know what I mean?\\". It's not hard to see where Spinal Tap got some of their inspiration from. Especially since this song is actually called Rock Bottom. Although in my opinion, UFO were better than the genre so cruelly parodied by Tap. UFO had a lot of things going for them- a cool name, great-looking album sleeves, one of the finest heavy rock guitarists ever, plenty of street cred and an unbroken suite of 5 classic albums in the 70s. Phenomenon is the first. Doctor Doctor was - and remains - a resounding heavy metal hit, guaranteed to get heads banging and air guitars playing at any party. Other powerhouse numbers include live favourite Oh My, while Crystal Light and Space Child and Too Young To Know showed that UFO were a deft hand at slower numbers and ballads. This, remember, was the band's first record with wunderkind Michael Schenker, fresh out of the Scorpions and heading for the stars. Whichever way you look at it, Phenomenon was a gigantic leap forward for the group in every respect.  UFO went from being a tired space-rock combo into a lean, mean metal machine virtually overnight. Spearheaded by Schenker's fiery guitar and Phil Mogg's nimble hard rock phrasing and assured songwriting, UFO were on a roll. The runaway best cut is Rock Bottom which, as well as boasting one of the best rock choruses this side of Tuesday, comes complete with a one of the defining rock guitar solos in rock.<br />After this album, UFO's career rocketed skyward, culminating in the pair of masterpieces of Lights Out and Obsessions. After that, of course, it was all downhill; the 80s happened and the sound of motions being gone through echoed loudly through the kingdom. But in 1974, they were hot to trot. You can hear it here. UFO beginners should try Lights Out and then this one. You know it makes sense.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I can Not put into words how much i wanted to like it but, Scorsese just didnt show how life was like in that period and the movies plot was too cliche. the charachters had no charachter and dont get me started on the accents. the only decent performance(and this may be due to the director) were Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|How many versions of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; are there. Most reviewers don't mention their copies being edited. &quot;A Viewer&quot; says his states &quot;running time 360 mins&quot; but I checked the version listed here on Amazon and it states &quot;running time 240 mins&quot;????<BR>What gives? The $11 price tag makes me suspicious about this being the full length, unedited series as originally broadcast.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|On first listen, I too though 'oh my god'. BUT, upon several listens now, the sound has grown on me. To all who think it's too muted and distant, just turn up the treble. It worked for me, all the detail is there.<br />In fact, this does sound more like a very excellent bootleg rather than a polished live recording. Which only adds to the power and listenability for me.<br />The drums sound FANTASTIC on this CD. The guitar and bass are fine, and whoever claims that you can't hear the bass guitar, are you even listening? It sounds OK. The vocals are a bit undermixed. Adding a little treble brightens the whole thing up and makes it completely listenable.<br />And, it's simply one of best live performances ever captured. The DVD and performace are stunning, best Rush ever.

0446677450|5.0|Why has this book been on the best sellers list for so long?? Simply because the message is profound. The truth of finanical success that this book presents is honestly a bitter pill for many of the hard working middle class to swallow. The most proud and egoistic of us might not even be willing to admit that this author has given us an honest message on why so many of us are doomed to late retirement and unsatisfying jobs. Read this book and read it well. Can you criticize? Yes. A few million dollars later. Let us not get angry, it really does not matter who finally gives us the message that we honestly need. What matters is that we learn well and utilize the lessons that we have learnt from Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Agree or disagree. A personal choice for your personal life.
B000002AZ8|5.0|With their third full length studio release, Pearl Jam continued their reign as the leaders of the modern rock (aka alternative) movement.  I think that all of Pearl Jam's albums are similar in their consistency and Vitalogy is no different.  What I mean is that all of thier albums are pretty similar in the sense that they can be broken down a bit like this:<br />On average, each of their albums has around 14 tracks.  The results are usually as follows (with a few exceptions obviously):<br />4 Tracks = Instant classics.  In this case &quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Nothingman&quot;, &quot;Immortality&quot;, and &quot;Betterman&quot;<br />5 Tracks = Hidden Gems.  Here we have &quot;Whipping&quot;, &quot;Tremor Christ&quot;, &quot;Satan's Bed&quot;, &quot;Last Exit&quot; and &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot;<br />1 Track = The overplayed radio song. &quot;Not For You&quot;<br />4 Tracks = The experiments that missed the mark. &quot;Bugs&quot;, &quot;Pry, To&quot;, &quot;Aye Davanita&quot;, &amp; &quot;Hey foxy...&quot;<br />Not a bad average overall.  Yes, there are some tracks here that will have you reaching for the skip button, but the rest easily make up for it.  PJ really hit their stride with Vs, and Vitalogy proved that they were here to stay.  Just another great album from a consistently great band.<BR>And to top it all off, they revive the somewhat lost art of the cool album sleeve.  CD's have caused album art to somewhat fall by the wayside, but in true classic rock form, Vitalogy's packaging &amp; artwork are original, meaningful, &amp; artsy.  These are the &quot;little things&quot; that seperate the good artists from the great ones, and this is where PJ started pulling away from the pack.
B000002JR8|5.0|Pantera is one of my fav. bands, hands down. To be honest, I never listened to them until 2000. I had Kill Em All, Master of Puppets, and Ride The Lighting, and that was as close to a real metal album I had. Finally, I bought Vulgar, and became an instant fan. Shortly after, I bought this on cassette, and I still have it, and it's still a fav. <br />I always thought Vulgar was their best album, but I have seen the light with Far Beyond Driven. It's by far their most heaviest, most intense,most angriest, most brutal album they ever made. The first song, &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot;, is full on thrash. Fast drums, fast guitars, and Phil having a tempter tantrum. Then during the bridge, Dimebag unleashes one of the best solos I ever heard from him. Musically, I thought this was their best record. Vinnie uses the double bass a lot more, Rex is more abundant, and Dimebag solos and licks are his best.<br />My fav is either &quot;I'm Broken&quot; or &quot;Slaughtered.&quot; I remember one time, I was having a really bad day and I put on &quot;I'm Broken&quot; and damn near destroyed everything in the room. Their music is that intense. &quot;Slaughtered&quot; almost reminds me of a death metal track, in that Phil sort of growls in this. Musically, Vinnie shines on here. His double bass movemants an his useage of the sticks is incredible. The last track is a cover of Black Sabbath's &quot;Planet Caravan.&quot; It's tied for the best BS cover alongside White Zombie's &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, and Type O Negative's &quot;Black Sabbath.&quot; Phil actually sings on here, and he sounds really good.<br />I have gotten the chance to see Pantera twice. Ozzfest 2000, and the Extreme Steel Tour with Slayer, and both times, they were amazing. Anyways, if you want to start to be a metal fan, I'd start with either this, Reign of Blood, or Master of Puppets.
B00005JMFI|4.0|In this delightful new holiday movie, Will Ferrell is an innocent named Buddy who was adopted as a baby by Santa and his elves.  Having been raised in the North Pole,  Buddy has no idea that he is human.  However, when he grows up to be a six-footer, he begins to notice that he is physically different from his fellow elves. Much to his chagrin, Buddy's skills as a toymaker are a bit substandard. Finally, Papa Elf sends his ingenuous son to New York City to meet his biological father, played by the gruff James Caan.<br />This is the classic &quot;fish out of water&quot; plot that has been used in countless movies. How will Buddy, conspicuous in his green and yellow elf costume, with a pointy hat and pointy shoes, behave in New York City? How will Buddy's no-nonsense dad handle the fact that he has fathered a man who thinks he's an elf?<br />Predictably, Buddy, in his sweet innocence, has trouble adjusting to life in the big city. He wreaks havoc in a department store, exasperates his father, and soon feels lonely and unwanted. All of this works because the actors, including such seasoned veterans as Bob Newhart and Ed Asner, play it absolutely straight. Fortunately, there are only a few of the cloying scenes that often make holiday movies so difficult to take.<br />Hats off to the director and the special effects crew for delivering some hilarious sight gags and some cool and magical moments.  Go see &quot;Elf&quot; with your kids.  It is not great cinema, but I think that you will find this movie engaging and amusing holiday entertainment.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater's IMAGES AND WORDS is, without a doubt, the most important and influential progressive rock album to come out in the past 10 years. Its impact upon the music scene was single-handedly so gigantic and phenomenal, that nearly every other progressive rock band to follow in their footsteps pales in comparison.<BR>Nearly every track on this album is now legendary, and all are, quite simply, FLAWLESS. From the original single, \\"Pull Me Under\\" to the fantastic \\"Metropolis, Part 1,\\" these eight songs are unbridled in their power and allure. This is not one of the kinds of albums where you skip around from song to song. It is to be treated like a great concept album: you just hit play, lay back, and enjoy it in its entirety.<br />Dream Theater is composed of five VIRTUOSOS. By that, I mean exactly what I say: they are all so fantastic at producing the music they do, they are unmatched. I'll discuss them all separately.<br />John Pettrucci is one of the most creative and talented guitarists ever, playing lush harmonies and sweeping melodies. He's got unbelievable speed, and is terrific at playing acoustic guitar. And of course, he's a master at heavy metal crunches (a major trait, after all, is present in Dream Theater's signature sound). Great lyricist and songwriter, too!<br />Mike Portnoy is jaw-dropping in his drumming and percussion skills - he's fast and yet fluid-like in his skin-beating. Does he have eight arms? It sure seems like he might. It's quite uncanny to think that he could just sit down and play all those beats and rhythms. Along with many, many other fans, I currently list him as my favorite drummer. Also a great lyricist and songwriter.<br />John Myung is a DISGUSTINGLY underrated bassist - he plays a SIX-STRING bass, and if you ever can see him in concert, you WILL NOT believe how fast his fingers fly over the strings as he creates complex rhythms to back the rhythm. Don't believe it? Just listen to the bass solo in \\"Metropolis, Part 1\\" and you'll know. He's written a few songs, but he really should do so more - he's very good at that, too!<br />Kevin Moore, keyboardist 1 of 3 for Dream Theater: TERRIFIC. Until recently, I've never been a big fan of keyboards; the synthesized sound was too...fake, I guess? But when a band such as Dream Theater is using keyboards, it helps increase the melody and feel of the songs. He's fantastic at creating beautiful, spacey textures, and when he plays just a piano sound, he's great at that, too! And yes, he, too is a great songwriter. He would stay with Dream Theater until 1994, shortly after the completion of their third album, AWAKE. He's now playing with O.S.I.<br />...and then there's James LaBrie, vocalist EXTRAORDINAIRE. He sings in a beautiful, smooth, tenor voice, carrying such emotion and power behind it - operatically trained, nonetheless. My favorite performance of his is on IMAGES AND WORDS is on \\"Under a Glass Moon\\" - \\"Outside the soundness of your mind/ Bathing your soul in silver tears...\\" Oooh, fantastic song. Anyway, James LaBrie (his first name is actually Kevin, but to avoid confusion with Moore, he went with his middle name...and yet there are still two JOHNS in the band...hmmm...) is simply one of the best male vocalists I've ever heard in any band, ever. And to think that this was his first album with Dream Theater - after hearing this, it is obvious that he simply was BORN to sing for them!<br />Dream Theater is at the top of their musical game on this album, and has created some fantastic songs on this album. Even after having said that this album is something one should listen to through and through because every song is so good, I'll still say that my absolute favorite song on here is \\"Under a Glass Moon.\\" Fast-paced, heavy, but so fluid in its melody, it is just...great! The choruses are the best part, too: Mike Portnoy's ultra-fast double-kick assault on the bass drums and John Pettrucci's quick metal crunches reinforce the heaviness, but James LaBrie's vocals simply SOAR, giving a sensation of air rushing past your face as you fly through the heavens...my god, what a song.<br />IMAGES AND WORDS: a fantastic, flawless album and, for many, the introduction to Dream Theater, the best progressive rock band ever to exist.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I started listening to disk one on my way home yesterday.  I had to remind myself to continue breathing.  Seriously, listening to Pearl Jam is like a religious experience.  I saw them 2 times live this summer, this disk just makes me want to see them again MORE THAN ever.  How can 5 human beings be THIS genious?  Perplexing.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I saw it coming with the release of The Screen Behind the Mirror. Your typical Enigma was ending. The 4th album did not have as many chants and had a harder edge to the music.  Everything good eventually has to end so something different can start.  <BR>No matter how wonderful the Gregorian chants are, there is only so much you can do with them.  I love MCMXC a.D.  Who doesn't?  But I don't want every cd released by Enigma to be a protoype of their first.  The music would no longer be so enigmatic like it was because you know what to expect.  <BR>So whats up with the &quot;new&quot; Enigma?  Is it Euro pop trash? Is it silly?  Has Cretu lost his mind?  Or is it just for us immature people who might like to listen to music legends like Madonna and Metallica?<BR>HARDLY!<BR>Ok, so I realize here everybody has a different taste of music.  I can handle that.  Not everybody is going to like this new sound of Enigma.  Some like it better.  Some like it just as well. And some people don't care for Madonna or Metallica as well.  <BR>But see the good in this change! So it doesn't have Gregorian chants anymore.  Get over it! If you need Gregorian chants, go listen to MCMXC.  It will always be there.  That won't change.  If you need songs like Beyond the Invisible, go listen to Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi.  If I am not mistaken, that should be there too.  <BR>If you take the time to listen to Voyaguer, you might notice Cretu has almost hid little bits of the past in this cd.  You can hear examples from Principles of Lust, like another reviewer wrote. I have heard it. You would be surprised what you hear that was taken from previous albums.<BR>And everything else in this cd is brand new.  I was taken back the first time I heard it.  But I don't think its immature or only listened to by immature people.  I see no reasoning from the sound of the new music to be able to make and justify the statement like that.   <BR>To be truthful, I love it.  In fact...<BR>It's currently takingN'Sync's spot in my cd player.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|I bought this for the third disc, of course...I have everything else multiple times.  I have everything the man's ever officially released on CD.  In fact, I paid my money for one song:  &quot;Trapped.&quot;  When I heard the E-Streeters play this in Boston in 2000, I just about lost it.  The 4 stars is for the rest of the bonus disc:  the only essentials are &quot;Held Up Without a Gun,&quot; &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; (though the falsetto may be off-putting at first, it's quite lovely) and &quot;The Big Payback.&quot;  But &quot;Code of Silence?&quot;  What happened?  I don't think I've ever been as unimpressed by a Boss track.  &quot;County Fair&quot; I could live without, and the countrified &quot;Countin' On a Miracle&quot; is kind of goofy.  In any case, since you can't get &quot;We Are The World&quot; anymore (thankfully), get this for &quot;Trapped.&quot;  Just don't play it in the car, unless you want a speeding ticket.
B000002UZ1|5.0|The blue album is an excellent compilation of songs for a beginning  beatle fan. I am 15 years old and found this on vinyl as i was looking throught my dad's old record collection and was pleasantly surprised and grateful that my old man has a good taste in music. Higlights of this collection include everything in my opinion, I am the walrus is a fun psycedilic song with a lot of energy and catchy guitar. &quot;while my guitar gently weeps&quot; is one of the most amazing songs, written by harrison. I am very  emotionally moved about the history of these songs as I learn about the era they were written in. &quot;Revolution&quot; is a great rock song fitting the era, the same with the smooth &quot;come together&quot;. Other songs that stand out among the rest are &quot;strawberry fields forever&quot; i like the drum and horn in that song. &quot;let it be&quot;, &quot;something&quot;, &quot;hey jude&quot;, &quot;the long and winding road&quot; &quot;don't let me down&quot; &quot;a day in the life&quot; are all beautiful ballads with great lyrics. &quot;Back in the USSR&quot; sounds a little like the beach boys but is a good song all the same. &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;with a little help from my friends&quot; are really good classics too. As i list a few of the songs i think stand out, DO NOT think that this is all! Buy this album and have a historic remembrance of the late 60's i wish so bad i could be a part of.
0385504209|1.0|I picked this book up with no knowledge about it; I just saw everyone reading it.  I found it horrible; I had to make myself finish it.<br />Basically, the leaps of logic made in the book are far out and unrealistic.  I found the book to also be very anti-Catholic, and, being a Catholic, I found much of the text to be offensive and inaccurate.  Anyone with a basic knowledge of Christian and Catholic history can punch holes through the plot so large that it becomes worthless to continue reading.<br />This is not an accurate book or a historical expose as many believe it to be; it is at best a poor fictional story.  My only regret is that many people pick up the book and read it, believing, as the author represents it to be, as a storyline imposed on a factual basis.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Whenever a musician changes their style in any way, shape or form, there is at least one fan of the musician's original material who does not like that change.  Many of these &quot;fans&quot; are quick to judge that musician as &quot;selling out&quot; (a wrongful accusation, as a band has to actually sign with a different record label as well as make drastic changes in their music in order to &quot;sell out&quot;).  Dream Theater, and many other bands, change and shape their sound with each album, and thus it's hard for some &quot;fans&quot; to keep interest in them over time.  That said, Dream Theater's seventh studio album, SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE, is no more a change than their others, and thus no sell-out.<br />What we have here are, on two discs, six terrific, beautiful, epic songs dealing various issues.  Musically, Dream Theater's never been heavier (except, perhaps, in parts of 1995's AWAKE).  This album was heavily influenced by Tool - no denying that - but it takes only the most fitting moments of that band to blend in with Dream Theater's sound.  As there are only six songs, I will go through each one individually...yes, even with &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.&quot;<br />&quot;The Glass Prison&quot; - After the static intro and a few guitar and bass notes, a loud crash of drums and thundering distorted guitar riffs instantly show the listener just how heavy this album is.  A few more riffs and crunches, peppered with melodic keyboards, and then all goes quiet except a fast, jagged riff that is simply infectious.  Then the song starts up again, but at the same pace as the solo, heavy with double-kick pedaling and an overall METAL feel to it.  In fact, when I first purchased this album, I seriously thought that for some reason, this was a different band I was listening to; however, as I listened, I realized that it really was Dream Theater.  The singing starts; it's mostly just Mike Portnoy at first, with little, blurry snarls from James LaBrie.  As the song is almost 14 minutes long, I won't get into the rest of it.  It's alternately fast and medium-paced, extremely heavy, but also very melodic.  Nice bass solo in the bridge, too, connecting a simply SHREDDING guitar solo to an eclectic keyboard solo.  A terrific song - just make sure you have time to listen to it!<br />&quot;Blind Faith&quot; - A wonderful 10 minute song, with lush textures and a sort of matter-of-factly depressing feel to it.  Parts of it present that Tool-esque feel.  The guitar solo is fantastic.  John Pettrucci's skill really is present here, then there is a brief instrumental interlude, then a great keyboard solo a la Jordan Rudess.  The piano solo towards the end of the bridge is also very nice.<br />&quot;Misunderstood&quot; - Possibly one of my most favorite Dream Theater songs, ever.  A luxurious clean guitar intro, soon after joined by breathy, beautiful singing from James LaBrie, instantly sets the mood.  It's much more like a &quot;traditional&quot; (although there is no such thing) Dream Theater song, but it is a bit heavier than their usual sound.  This is the second shortest song on the album, but it IS still over 9 minutes long.  It gets fairly dark in the second verse onward, but it's just so beautiful and becalming.  Eerie outro, too.  Ooh, I love this one.<br />&quot;The Great Debate&quot; - I saw them perform this one in concert, before I owned this album.  The song was so good that, although I already wanted to own everything in Dream Theater's catalogue, I wanted to get this album more than ever.  Musically it is heavy, with fairly angry snarls from James LaBrie in the chorus.  Like &quot;The Glass Prison,\\" it starts off fairly quiet, but gets much, much louder as it goes on.  It is also over 13 minutes long.  Subjectively, it is about stem cell research, and even features a few samples from radio and TV interviews of people's opinions about the topic.  Also, THIS SONG IS NOT IN SUPPORT OR IN FAVOR OF STEM CELLRESEARCH.  It is simply about the great debate over the matter, and the reasons behind each argument.<br />&quot;Disappear&quot; - A fairly depressing song, written by James LaBrie.  I'm pretty sure it's about coping with the loss of a loved one.  Spacey sound effects and keyboards lead to an acoustic guitar intro, and LaBrie's vocals harmoniously go with the strumming.  He sounds so pained and saddened; this is one of the most emotional songs I've ever heard from Dream Theater, if not from any band.  Shortest song on the album, too: less than seven minutes long.  Regardless of time, this is a splendid, emotional masterpiece.<br />&quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; - HOT damn, this is a long song.  42 minutes long, this song is the longest that Dream Theater has ever written, beating 1995's &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; (review coming soon!), which clocked in at 23 minutes.  It is also because of this song's length that it was put on a separate disc, and is (thankfully) split into eight tracks.  This is the epic tale of a girl suffering from some kind of mental disorder.  It has whole sweeping sections of alternating heaviness and melody, and is especially plentiful with keyboards.  It's really hard to describe everything within this song, so you'd best just experience it for yourself.  Again, just make sure you have the time to listen to it!<br />So there it is.  SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE is the heaviest album Dream Theater has ever made, and as a result, many &quot;fans&quot; were quite disappointed with it.  I, however, think it is just as good as anything else.  Dream Theater is a band about taking risks and progressing into new sonic realms, and with this album, they have found a new nook in the deepest realms of heavy progressive rock.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Their is not much to say, I am a long time fan of Dream Theater and have seen them live several times. This album only sounds like Dream Theater on some songs. It's heavy and lacking feeling, other than anger. I am extremely disappointed. If I wanted to listen to old Metallica, Pantera, or Joe Satriani I would put their cd in. Two stars is very generous in my opinion.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I am a really big fan of British indie/rock music these days but before I got into what I now know as good music there was one album that played on my stereo everyday.<BR>The one that I am talking about is album number 4 from those little scamps Blink 182. This was the album that broke the boys into the mainstream and I can really understand why. The first 3 albums were good but had an un-professional/made in my mates bedroom type feel.<BR>Each track on the album is as good as the next although \\"All the small things\\" may make you feel like it's been played one too many times. \\"What's my age again\\" was the other big single from this album and has the now famous video of the boys running around town naked.<BR>The America only single \\"Adam's song\\" is one of the more serious moments on this album and is slow at the start but rushes into a thundering chorus which is a good thing. The reason that it is good is because as you all know the critics have never taken Blink seriously and this is a step closer to maturity.<BR>This is a punk record and although some would argue against that, the fact is still there. If You have ever listened to \\"Dumpweed\\", \\"The party song\\" or \\"Anthem\\" you will know what I am talking about as all these songs have the amp turned up fully and rock harder than Metallica and Pantera put together(that may be going a bit far).<BR>The only down side is that an album of this quality should last a lot longer than 35 minutes and it can be punishing listening to \\"you know what\\" after hearing it on mtv all day.<BR>So if your looking for something that will make you feel good and can realise that they are a punk band as well as the likes of The Clash and The Sex Pistols this is the perfect album.<BR>If not........... go and buy Radiohead-Kid A and you'll know why it's good to listen to an upbeat record.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania returns after a 3 year break form the stage. I was there in Chicago and this show ROCKED THIS COUNTRY!!! This is the best special yet from the queen of country. From old favorites like \\"Any Man of Mine\\" and \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\\" to signature songs like \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" to the new songs off of Up! \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\\", \\"In My Car\\", and \\"Forever and For Always\\", Shania is covered on this DVD. Plus, the excitment of \\"I'm Outta Here!\\", \\"Nah!\\", and \\"Rock This Country\\" top off this party with Shania!!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is a great Dream Theater album and by far their heaviest album yet. TOT will quicky become a fave among metal fans, but for the fans that loved Images and Words, and Scenes from a Memory, they have been short changed. This albums lacks the classical sound that most Dream Theater albums have. Train of Thought focuses on just being hardcore rather than artistic. Although artistic in its own way, Train of Thought still doesn't quite measure up to the originality of Images and Words and Scenes from a Memory. If trying to decide which Dream Theater album to start off with, I'd tell you buy Scenes from A memory or Images and words first, then it's a toss up between 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulance and Train of Thought. Either way, Train of Thought is still a great album. I definetly reccamend it for the metal fan.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|AMAZING......  A must for any RUSH fan, or anybody who enjoys great music and watching top notch musicians perform !
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Grant it if your a bruce fan you have the songs from the first two discs. But for those of you who think this is all about money its not.  Columbia has done this with all its artists....dylan, joel and now the boss.  This is a great addition to one's springsteen collection. And anyone who thinks that bruce's songs have gotten worse don't understand his music.  So don't listen to the punks above who aren't real fans.
B000003TA4|1.0|I just dont like it *shrugs* it sounds like cheesy party music to me, ill stick with my Smiths albums, &amp; Bob Marley albums instead
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is another masterpiece! Who cares if it took three weeks to write? Those who criticize the time line probably can't write or read enough music to understand the talent at play here. Therefore, they should just shut up and rock! I'd like to see Papa Roach, Mudvayne, or some of the other so called 'metal' acts even come close to writing of this caliber.  This album rocks in all aspects from music to dynamics to production...a SOLID effort from the boys. You should buy it. Everyone should buy it....and when you buy it, play it LOUD...for all to hear.
0156027321|5.0|As I was reading this novel, I enjoyed it, but I was a little let down.  I had heard such great reviews, and although I thought the book was interesting and well written, it just didn't meet my expectations...until I read the last 15 or so pages.  WOW - what an incredible ending.  It was such a great ending, that I wanted to open the book back to the beginning and read it again.  There is no doubt in my mind, that this book is truly deserving of the awards and praise it has received - and worthy of a 5-star rating.<br />This book is a powerful story of survival and the will to live.  The author presents the story honestly and does not shy away from detail.  Even though I found some parts of the book disturbing, it adds to the author's credit of being a great story-teller.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Warning, this album is heavy and dark, much more so than even Awake. However it is still very much DT. Portnoy's drumming is nothing short of spectacular once again and to think that this album was recorded in April, and released in November is scary, these guys are the real deal. My favorite track has to be &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; it is a very dark/depressing soung, but it flows very well and does not get old. Buy this album, once again DT proves that they can not make a bad album.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|What we have here is a film that is not really about anything - and that in sci-fi, usually the more thoughtful kind of action movie.     There's some fun super-techy-future mumbo jumbo, but if there is a larger statement here it's something involving pursuit of love and avoidance of hungry monsters, which seems a little too easy..    The result feels rather like watching a rube-goldberg contraption as it goes through the motions leading to a moment of .. no payoff.  Just a fizzle towards the end.    The original book actually had a far-left-wing slant which is now far too radioactive for this kind of popcorn matinee.  These people should have known what they were getting into and either made the real movie with that plot, or found another larger theme.        Saving the would-be girlfriend who only has 15 lines of dialogue and her tribe of clueless meat-puppets did not cut it for me.  It's a shame because some of the special effects here are really impressive and will be influential in their own right.     For the movie as a whole, this unfortunately is a non-hunting dog.  Don't waste your time.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam has made the greatest album (double album - whatever) in the history of music
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Being a huge dream theater fan, and with the briliant body of work they have amassed over the last 20 years, (especially the last two albums) I half expected this album to be a disapointment. I was mistaken, dream theater never disapoints. Not only is this their heviest work to date, but they show no sign of having any limit to their creativity and musical diversity. the album opens with the blistering &quot;As I am&quot; which then translates emidiatly into &quot;this dying soul&quot; an eleven minute epic with no let down from start to finish. John Petrucci's blazing chops are in full force through this piece. this piece also contains several lyrical referances to some of their older work. &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; is amazing, and i do believe &quot;In the Name of God&quot; is their first venture into a blatent socially comentative lyrical exploration. Mike Portnoys drumming on &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; is second to none. Overall another briliant piece of work by one of the best bands in the world! anyone would do good to pay attention to this stuff, its going to be around for quite some time.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is where Dream Theater were meant to go.  This album IS heavy, like many others have pointed out.  No one song has no distortion.  As always, each band member is able to prove himself many times over as a master of his instrument.  For me this CD kind of popped up out of nowhere.  For a long time there was no info surrounding it on their website, so I stopped looking at it regularly, but then I checked it the day before it came out.  The next day I was coming home with my very own copy.  I put in the CD and after my first listen I can conclude that this is the only direction they could have gone from their last efforts (that's what progressivity is all about).  Five of the Ten songs spand over 10 minutes.  (As I Am is almost 8 and Vacant is 3 minutes).  On each song all the players sound as if they've improved considerably, especially Petrucci, who doesn't mind showing off his mastery of the axe.  Just from listening I can tell the technicallity of his solos is way beyond any of his previous work.  Mind you, however, that some of his solos aren't necessarilly something that is melodic just pretty damn impressive.  LaBrie's vocals are more aggresssive on many tracks, but that's not a let down.  He sings fine with any style of music.  Ruddess relies a bit too much on the electronic sounds of his keyboard, when the piano has a much more beautiful tone.  Myung is always great in his own humble way; he doesn't care if he's in the spotlight or not.  Portnoy is also always great.  The final song is definitely what they meant the CD to be all about.  They let all the emotion out in a broad, epic song that encompases the sound of the whole record and end the entire CD with a dissonant piano chord that sends a shiver down your spine.  It's all superbly done and wrappe dup in a neat 7 song package that demonstrated what these guys are all about.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>but i still like scenes from a memory better
B00006LJ72|5.0|I have listed to Enya for quite a while now but havent got a chance to to listen to all the songs. When I got this, I not only got to listen to the songs I've been missing, but also got to see her preform on the final disk. If you have plenty of money to spend and love Enya, I urge you to get this.
0553277472|1.0|What a great title.  And even an intriguing concept...explaining zen via the motorcycle.  Unfortunately, the book turns out to be a long winded narcissistic lecture by a person you wouldn't want to be stuck in a car with, never mind a motorcycle.  Don't waste your time.  Take a mindful walk instead.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album is so incredibly amazing,  the best album ever before 1991, &amp; the only albums that have topped it are other Pearl Jam albums, go buy &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; by them (pj) tho if you want to REALLY hear some amazing music, thats all.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|P!nk... you have done it again!  You have completely blown my pants off!  Some say you are jumping on the Avril Lavigne band waggon... well girl you make Avril sound like a Sugar Coated Breakfast Cereal!  Keep it up!  Anyone who is truly a fan will appreciate yet another fine fine fine record.  <br />Peace Out!
B00005JMFR|5.0|THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. THE ENDING WAS GREAT, BEST WAY TO END THIS TRILOGY, THOUGH THEY DIDNT GO IN THE MATRIX THAT MUCH BUT IT WASNT ABOUT THAT IT WAS MOSTLY THE WAR AGAINST THE MACHINES WHICH WAS A GREAT BATTLE. ITS NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES BUT IT IS WORTH WATCHING AND DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING WHEN IT COMES OUT.
B00005OWEG|5.0|The first version of this film was an empty experience with explosions that everyone loved. This is the real deal retaining the visceral, narcototropic ethos of unbearable impending doom but adding a 'quieter' layer of allegorical weight which the first edit lacked. Now a true journey into the &quot;heart of darkness&quot;, with more echoes from that seminal text. Brilliant now, middling before.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens still stands, almost 20 years after it's original release, as the gold standard against which other Sci-Fi/Horror/Thillers are judged. Just about everything in this movie is perfect. <br />James Cameron's screenplay is an awesome extension and expansion of the Aliens' and Ripley's story- recounting the all savageness and terrifying qualities of the aliens without re-treading old material and even adding a few new twists that make them even scarier than they already were. Not the least of which is having many, many more of them.<br />The acting and directing are excellent. Unlike most Horror/Thrillers, each of the characters (with a couple of minor exceptions) is unique and memorable, and even though they do rely a little heavily on some clichéd stereotypes, they play the stereotypes so well we love them anyway. When we lose any of them, and not to spoil the plot or anything but we do lose quite a few, the impact is clearly felt. We like these guys and we want them to win. <br />The opening is good, explaining what happened before and how it has affected Ripley, and setting up a believable reason why she would ever consider going back. Once things get going- and boy, do they get going- we know it's going to be, as one character puts it, \\"an express elevator to hell- going down!\\" I mean that in a good way- this is one smooth, scary, fun ride.<BR> <BR>Some of the action scenes are chaotic- which is of course as it should be when you are trying to depict a fierce battle or a life-and-death struggle. In the heat of combat the characters can't see or know exactly what's going on and that's part of what makes the situation so frightening. By accurately showing the disorienting nature of these action sequences, Cameron makes us feel just as terrified as the characters in the movie are, and yet he never makes things so confusing that we are completely lost. You always can tell generally what's happening, and usually, what's happening is bad. In between the action scenes there are lots of good \\"atmosphere\\" scenes which serve to both further explain the story, flesh out the characters, and heighten the overall tension and sense of fear. <br />Anyone who says that the production values are less than excellent hasn't seen the movie or doesn't know what they are talking about. The sets are huge, extremely detailed, and have that rare but important \\"well-worn\\" look. Nothing in the movie looks like fake or like a prop- it all looks real and like it's been used- just like it would in real life. Too often in sci-fi the set designers seem to think that in the future, nothing ever gets dirty or that every ship and remote outpost will have The Galaxy's Best Maid Service - everything looks new and perfectly clean. In Aliens, things look appropriately modern but they are also messy- In a word, everything looks very realistic. I think the budget for the movie was about $20M, which in 1986 was not low, but it looks like they spent twice that much. <br />A note about the Aliens- the original movie introduced without question the scariest and deadliest movie monster ever created. It's been copied and imitated but it would be hard to imagine making one better. James Cameron succeeded - twice. First, the one flaw in the original is that we didn't get to see much of it and when we did, it was fairly obvious that it was a guy in a suit. I mean, it was a scary-looking alien suit, but it still looked, and moved, like a guy in an alien suit. Now, in this sequel, Cameron specifically set out to make the aliens look MORE \\"alien.\\" To do that he did a number of things, including adding some detail to the overall creature design, but most importantly he changed the way they move- instead of walking upright on the ground all the time, these aliens crawl, jump, slither and swim- on the walls, on the ceiling, and on the floor, and, except when they are camouflaged and waiting in ambush, they are always moving. Their tails thrash about behind them and over their heads, and they contort into un-natural positions. In some cases, it's still guys (actually girls, I think, because they had to be very thin and flexible) in suits, in other cases, it may be animatronics, in every case, they look like freaking monsters. Sometimes, you see them move in the shadows and you can't quite tell which end is up- that is on purpose and it's effect is to make them look more like aliens/bugs and less like us. That, in turn, makes them even scarier. On top of all that, Cameron gives us a completely new form of alien that was alluded to in the past but now is seen it all it's glory- and without giving away details to the three people who haven't yet seen this movie- well, let's just say she's a real bad-ass. <br />This DVD contains some extra scenes which have been re-inserted into the film- some of them are interesting and add a little extra back story about Ripley and life on the colony before it gets overrun, including a nice piece that explains how that happens. Some other scenes later in the movie I could do without- they add a little extra action but they're not that interesting. Some of the other extras include some behind-the-scenes stuff about how they designed the creature effects and how they shot certain scenes- kind of cool if you are a film student or die-hard fan of the franchise. <br />If you liked the original, or if you have any interest in sci-fi, action, or horror flicks, this DVD is already in your collection or it ought to be.
0375432302|2.0|Very simply, the author starts with a false premise and continues to prove that false premise, with flawed reasoning. In physics or math we would call this a mathematical construct...like building a house with the first brick placed squarely in mid-air! The book is historically innaccurate, theologically innaccurate and inductively and deductively incorrect.  Entertainment only for those susceptible to pap or who choose not to do their homework on the historical facts.
0800177975|5.0|This is one of those movies that a lot of people that haven't seen it say, &quot;That movie wasn't really that good, was it?&quot; but those that have seen it, say, &quot;Why wasn't this movie more popular?&quot; Maybe it was bad timing, or as some others suggested, just not correctly billed to the public.<br />Last Action Hero is hard to describe. It's funny, it's witty, with lots of those one-liners that Arnold became so popular with, and I loved the way he constantly poked fun at his fictional character as well as his &quot;real&quot; self. Some of my favorite dialogue in the movie is when the kid is trying to convince &quot;character Arnold (aka: Jack Slater)&quot; that he's actually just a character in a movie. The kid starts asking about phone numbers and how can they possibly all start with 555- in a city with several million phone numbers, when Jack Slater exasperatedly says, &quot;That's why we have Area Codes...&quot; Priceless. The movie is full of fun stuff like that, and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is even remotely a Schwarzenegger fan, or who just like campy, yet intelligent, movies. The parody within a parody, and movie within a movie actually worked well in this one.<br />I thought the movie had a lot of great character performances, and clever scripting, and I think this movie got a bum rap. It's really a great movie, I'm glad I bought the DVD. The transfer is a little sloppy in places on the one I bought, but since it's a &quot;Special Anniversary Edition&quot;, I have a feeling that had something to do with it. There's only a fullscreen version on my DVD, no widescreen, and the camera pans are really noticeable in a few places.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This album is heavy, fast and full of pure emotion that only DT can deliver.  From the Orionesque instrumental \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" to the raw power of \\"Honor Thy Father\\" this disc has it all.  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up!
B000000993|2.0|This is probably their best album, and it's still not that great. Why would anyone rather listen to this instead of &quot;Rein in Blood&quot; by Slayer, or &quot;Overkill&quot; by Motorhead, &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; by Iron Maiden, &quot;Kill 'em All&quot; by Metallica, &quot;Back in Black&quot; by AC/DC, or &quot;Masters of Reality&quot; by Black Sabbath ??  Sorry, but Tool are 2nd level musicians only.
0440217563|2.0|The whole scenario was annoying and far-fetched with the jewels.  The reunion of the two lovers was touching.  But everything was ruined by the movement of the storyline setting to the caribbean island.  It was just utterly ridiculous and bored me to tears with the whole thing.  Did not like this one at all for those reasons.
B00007LTIA|4.0|No doubt. TFTO actually contains the most memorable musical passages in Yes'music history. There's only one problem with it. The best parts are buried between overdone indulgent musical extravagazas. 'The Ancient' would have been better if the intro was 50% shorter. Both 'The Revealing Science of God' and 'The Remembering' suffer from excessive repetitions. 'Ritual', the album's conclusion starts off with a beautiful trance-like theme. Only after the middle section does the piece fall apart.<br />TFTO marks Alan White's first studio appearance. Although I prefer Bill Bruford in charge of the sticks, Alan White brought in a more swinging feel that Bruford lacked. While Bruford led the rhythm section from his skillful snare - hi hat combination, Alan White led with his bass drum, bringing a muscular bottom end  which proved to perfectly complement Squire's bass lines.<br />Wakeman is largely absent (except for the occasional mellotron  or minimoog lines here and there), which might explain his growing disinterest in directions Anderson and Howe were pursuing.<br />If only YES concentrated on the better parts (leaving the unnecessary journeys out), it would have been a single LP and  maybe even better than Close To The Edge. But they didn't.
B00008DDXC|1.0|When I snuggle onto the couch with a tub of warm, buttery popcorn and a bag of Ring Dings, the last thing I want is some boring documentary on witchcraft. This movie's one fault is its desire to be realistic, which it most certainly is. Other then that though, what does it have going for it? Special effects<BR>WRONG...the snake looked fake, fake snake= dull movie. Not even Maggie Smith can redeem this crud, even though she is quite a babe. The only good scene in this waste of time and money is when she goes swimming with Harry, winking at him that it is &quot;Extra Credit.&quot; The old gal's still got it! <br />Two thumbs, ahem Wands, down.
0385504209|4.0|I've been eyeing this book for months, what with all the buzz surrounding it.  I finally broke down and bought it after I saw the PrimeTime special on the underlying premise of the book.  I was not disappointed one bit.  The book sucked me in after the first few pages and propelled me through to the end.  My mind is still swimming with all the facts and historical tidbits that urge the story forward.  I found Robert Langdon to be a pragmatic hero, and his female counterpart Sophie Neveu quite likable, too.  Although Sopie's grandfather and Louvre curator Jacques Sauniere was murdered, he is one of the most lively characters in the book thanks to frequent references, his ingenius coding,  and Sophie's flashbacks.  Sir Leigh Teabing was hilarious enough, until the truth about him is revealed in the end.  Law enforcement officers and members of the church provide a strong cast of secondary characters.<br />Though some readers may find the symbolism of the Grail actually being Mary Magdalene a bit over the top, I found it a challenging theory for Christianity to consider.  In addition to being a swell read, the book itself was very informative on a plethora of symbology.  This book might be the best-researched work of fiction I've ever read.  Brown incorporates history and symbology into the plot flawlessly.<br />I look forwad to the next Robert Langdon book, as I've heard one is in the works.  He's sort of like a nerdier Indiana Jones, whose adventures carry him through museums, libraries and cathedrals rather than Indie's slightlly more exotic locales.<br />If you want a clever mystery that moves at light speed, this book is for you.
B00005JM0B|2.0|If you've seen this laugh-out-loud-bad movie, you know that line.  Arnold's forehead has been hit with a bullet; a moment later, he spits out the bullet.  Then the close-up!  Arnold's face fills the screen and in a perfect dead-pan: &quot;Don't do dat!&quot; in all of the Austrian glory Mr. Schwartzeger can muster.  It is hilarious, of course, like so many other lines in this silly movie contorted by the accent that Arnold either refuses to give up or cannot give up.  (I'm not sure which is worse.) I had a good time just laughing at this stupid stuff, but there is so little else worthwhile in this flick that it simply isn't enough to make you want to sit through a couple of valuable hours.<br />Think of this as Terminator 2 meets Lethat Weapon meets the Producers.  That about sums it up.  The story is a time travelling tale that is so similar to the last installment, that it is possible that they picked up the earlier script (perhaps a bad second draft) and decided to mutilate with bad jokes (yes, there is some intentional &quot;humor&quot; here), bad acting, and bad directing.  The special effects are just so-so.  There is a chase scene that is so over-the-top that it has its minimal pleasures, but certainly nothing to write home about.<br />I suppose that I could end this review right there.  But I can't, because this film destroyed a promising franchise.  The first two Terminators were well crafted and enjoyable, with interesting ideas, fine directing, and good performances.  This one is a poorly written, campy mess that can't seem to decide whether to be serious or not.  You owe it to yourselves to avoid it.  No need to send any signal that they ought to milk more money out of this corpse.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer is sadly often overlooked. In my opinion it shares the same league with Fragile, Close To The Edge and Going For The One. Putting Relayer in perspective, it was a fresh recovery from the ill-executed Tales From Topographic Oceans (TFTO). Although it was rumoured in 1974 that TFTO's follow-up would be a straight rocker album, Relayer proved anything but standard. In fact, Relayer's progression surpassed previous Yes albums on a few levels. <br />It is difficult to put Patrick Moraz' influence on the album in perspective, as he was brought in after most basic tracks were already delivered on tape. However, any stuff that he added was completely superb. If you listen closely to the melodic scales he uses in his solos (i.e. To Be Over, Sound Chaser), his musical vocabulary sounded more progressive than any of Wakeman's work (of course, with the exception of Close To The Edge). <br />The Gates of Delirium is a superb 10-minute long epic. It is even superior compared to ALL the epics on the previous Tales album which lacked focus. At least, the Gates of Delirium retained a cohesive focus and a climactic conclusion. However, the live version on Yesshows (recorded with Moraz in 1976) sounds more punchier and muscular, even compared to this remastered version.<br />Sound Chaser is a real experiment in musical elements, a tour-de-force crossover between Chick Corea's Return To Forever, King Crimson and (some say) Balinese chanting. Much has been said on the other-wordly guitar solo in the middle. Even Patrick Moraz's rhodes intro (again, listen to those scales) and his flashy moog solo sounded unlike anything YES has ever recorded before or ever since.<br />Relayer is not for everyone, however. It is perhaps one of the hardest YES albums to digest for an average music listener. For those who get over it, it's hard to pull the CD out from your CD player !
B0000024K1|1.0|This album is half baked, a nonsensical hodgepodge of militiant fight music and boring, repetitive beats. Who is bass? What are they talking about? If anyone understands What Chuck is talking about when he screams BASS at the top of his lungs then you belong on the same planet as these not very fab four. Two thumbs down Professor Griff. Check out Will Smith, Notorious B.I.G. or The Insane Clown Posse for better beats and a more uplifting, wholesome, positive message. Bashing the government is not cool, I don't think George Bush is listening to this record right now. And if our president can't listen to it, who should be allowed to? Certainly not you.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Again Dream Theater proves they can play whatever they want however they want and still make it as beautiful as their past work. Here their approch is much heavier than their past work (which isn't a bad thing). \\"As I Am\\" & \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" are my favorites of the album, but I love every track on this album. I have only got through the album twice now and I feel it's one of their better albums to date. It too early for me to write my feelings on where exactly it ranks among some of their brillant works such as \\"Images\\" or \\"Scenes\\". It's up there. If you are a DT fan....well you should already own this, but if you like bands like Opeth or Into Eternity, then check this out. If you are new to Dream Theater, start off with one of their classics like \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" or \\"Images & Words\\".<br />P.S. To all of you out there that bash every DT album because it's too \\"Self-Indulgent\\",then go back to your one-dimensional, no guitar/bass solo used, cheap and unoriginal written works of garbage and leave real music with talented musicians alone. I think I speak for many when I say it's nice to hear someone out there with more intentions than crying about problems in their lyrics to attract teenagers and actually use their musical ability to inspire.
B00003CWL6|4.0|If the screenplay for American Beauty had been submitted to one of those many silly contests (where they take your fee and give you nothing), it would have lost.  It has voice overs, you see, and cardinal rule one of writing movies is no voice overs.  Rule two is no voice overs.  And so on.<br />Anyway, forget the rules.  The prose in American Beauty is stunning, the observations of small moments in American life trenchant.  No, this movie doesn't answer all the big questions, or maybe any of them.  And, yes, it does drip with a lot of silly Hollywood attitude (like the observation that those who oppose homosexuality must be closet gays, or worse).  What this movie does well is provide a snapshot into a real life (Kevin Spacey's), and gives us a lot to chew on about what passes for living in modern America.  It is, at its heart, a story about the difference between society's expectations and our inner lives.  And about finding ways to break free of those expectations.
B00007LTIC|5.0|GFTO is aesthetically the most beautiful album YES has ever produced (although slightly less interesting compared to Close To The Edge). I surely think that YES in 1976 had stopped progressing (despite Wakeman's return to the band). Having said that, GFTO seems to mark the band's attempt to refine much of their former musical explorations already pursued from Fragile (1972) up to Relayer (1974). Sonically, GFTO introduces new sonic textures from the keyboard camp. Out are the traditional sounds of Rick's mellotron, hammond or minimoog. Enter the Polymoog...<br />Wonderous Stories, the opener, is a melodically beautiful ballad, reminiscent of Ýour Move'from The Yes Album. Much praise should go to Squire's weaving bass lines, and harmony vocals (which are astonishingly higher pitched than Anderson's). <br />The next track (GFTO) is a fresh and energetic rocker. It also contains, in my humble opinion, one of Squire's best composed harmony vocals (just notice on the chorus line how Squire sings a major seventh note on the word 'One'- a half note lower than Jon's - almost unnoticeable). Wakeman returned with different keyboard textures, most notably the bright textures of the Polymoog. Last note: nobody would have thought that a pedal steel could really chase so hard...<br />Much said about Turn of the Century. It is a beautiful song and craftedly arranged. If you listen close to Steve's nylon guitar and Jon's vocal, it appears as if they are playing two different compositions simultaneously, creating a wonderful dialogue between guitar and the vocal.<br />Parallels is a straight grandiose rocker, powered by Vevey's St. Martin's church organ. Again, great vocal and bass arrangements. However, the song ended up cluttered within the battlefield of the Howe - Wakeman wars (there just ain't enough room for a large church organ and endlessly jumping guitar solos draped over a busy rhythm section). A first hint at what would plague YES' next Tormato album....<br />Awaken is probably one of the better longer piece epics from YES' entire discography. It starts of with a typical Wakeman piano solo followed by a quiet other-wordly atmosphere, before it takes off violently. And just as you would think the rhythm and chanting would go on forever and ever amen, a surprising break of modulated chords played on the pipe organ takes the song off to a higher level. Awaken has one of the best epic climaxes YES has ever composed (comparable to 'Soon' which concluded 'The Gates of Delirium' on 1974's Relayer). Instead of building on majestic mellotron chords, they brought in a real choir for the song.<br />GFTO represents a band in mature form, capitalizing on everything it has learned from previous albums. Although first time YES listeners might like this album, it lacks the excitement and sense of discovery that really made Fragile or Close To The Edge such classic gems. <br />The only disappointment is the album cover. I thought Hypgnosis accidently pressed a Pink Floyd sleeve....
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Sorry I had to copy another review's title but I couldn't agree more with it. Years pass by and really, only 1% of all music is any good. 1 Fille &amp; 4 Types is an album that defines what music was always meant to be. It's emotional and creative. I LOVE the cover of this album. Celine in a natural environment with Jacques, Erick, Jean-Jacques, and Gildas. This is MUSIC people! It's not trying to be something it's not. She doesn't try to be Britney here like she does on &quot;One Heart.&quot; This album is all about creativity and art. I'm serious here people. Albums like this don't come around every day. If you don't buy this album you are missing something special. I don't care if you're not a Celine Dion fan. I don't care if you don't understand French. This is QUALITY music!
6305842442|5.0|The true test of a classic, as everyone knows, is how it survives the passage of time.  Blade Runner is a classic.  It is as stunning a film today as it was when released more than twenty years ago.   Those who think the plot is too slow and the acting subpar are those raised on a diet of explosions and mayhems every two point five minutes in any given movie in order to sustain their interest.  Ridley Scott is a master of the mise-en-scene.  The &quot;slow pace&quot; serves to heighten the suspense just as it did in the first &quot;Alien,&quot; and the theme of the modern man losing his humanity is as appropos today as ever.  There has been enough written about the set design and the music that I don't need to repeat the obvious.  The only disappointment with this DVD is the picture quality and the lack of bonus materials, both of which, rumor has it, will be remedied in a three disc set to be released some time next year.<BR>Let's hope it will do this film full justice.
B000007R1M|3.0|They say this is the first `techno' album ever... who knows.<br />It sounds really weird even now, and it was made in the seventies.<br />Personally my favourite is `The Model'... it's almost... commercial...<br />They say these guys used to compose the same number of notes everyday...<br />It's interesting. `Spacelab' is a cute and nice song.<br />If you listen to this you will feel catatonic-elektronik-psykodelik-grooveytronik-...<br />This is the stone age of techno.
B0000CFW87|5.0|From the first track to the last, this CD is by far the best I've heard in a long time.  &quot;Mi Mancherai&quot; (track 3) is so beautiful it leaves me breathless.  It may be my favorite.  Oh, wait!  No.  It's &quot;Hymne A L'Amour&quot; - Josh and the French language were made for each other.  Although &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; is really battling for my #1 spot.  On the other hand...  I've decided I can't decide which is my favorite.  You must decide for yourself and the only way to do that is to buy this CD right away!
B000056V73|2.0|A tedious film, but I give it two stars instead of one since films are usually about beautiful people and the subtext of this film was: the pain of ugly people. That's original. But it was a dull film; and I'm a fan of that rock era, and I still couldn't wait for it to end.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I must say that I thought Dream Theater was starting to become weaker with the past couple of albums.  However, even those albums were still great works of art!  Personally, this album blows all other Dream Theater albums away.  It has a very heavy sound for each song, and it makes me remember just why Dream Theater is one of my favorite groups.  I don't care if this album took a few weeks, few days, or even a few months to produce, it rocks!  Besides Symphony X, there are no groups on the market that can even create music with such emotion, talent, and awesome guitar riffs!
B000002GQJ|5.0|One of the \\"Seven Classics\\" from the Moody Blues, the best band ever in my own taste, and perhaps the fathers of symphonic rock as it is known nowadays, this is a masterpiece just like the rest, with a much more direct \\"band\\" format. Mike Pinder's mellotron still owns a very important part in the whole sound. The awesome talent of each member of the band gets showed in every song as well as their own instruments which play a main part in each one's compositions.<br />`Question'... what can you say about this song. A classic from the Moodies, perhaps their most complete song along with `Legend of a Mind', is a protest song and a love song, a ballad and a rocker, a political song about Vietnam war (with very deep spiritual reflexions) and an absolutely glorious sing of personal and sentimental feeling about love, loneliness and the difficulty of life that everyone can share. It's really two different songs put together, but the outcome is a very `balanced' double song.<br />Mike Pinder's participation includes two very different songs, `How is It (We Are Here)' is a fantastic song about Mother Nature full with psychedelic references. The fuzz guitar solo by Justin Hayward is amazing. The other song, `Melancholy Man' is a very sad and dramatic one, almost apocalyptic, with words full of meaning as always happens with this man's songs. The voices and mellotrons evocate a very dramatic situation in which the world has been sunk in darkness.<br />John Lodge appears with the fast `Tortoise and the Hare', a philosophical song about the tale of the same name, that means that you have to do what you believe, not be scared of some people trying to overtake you or seem to be better `cos at the end, if you follow your own beliefs they will prevail at last. The other song from his is `Minstrel's Song' very philosophical as well and with this wonderful chorus, \\"listen to the one who sings of love\\".<br />What really happens with the Moody Blues is while their music is as good as from any other great band, they dare to say things that other bands don't, busy trying to catch the eyes of people just for commerciality. This five guys opened their own souls completely in every song in a way no band has ever done. That's why they are my favourites from all time.<br />The other two sharings from Justin Hayward apart from `Question' are two: The great `It's Up to You', a nice rocker with very optimistic words and music, and the wonderful `Dawning is the Day' in which he seems to give advice to a person that's changing his life and finding a lot of new things in his own soul. It has a very soft part at the beginning, followed by a strong middle part that stounds as an intense and heartfelt one. The words are a bit of a resurrection, the whole song would be full of meaning in some times of your life.<br />Ray Thomas, the flute player, adds two songs, the superb ballad `And The Tide Rushes In', which came after a fight with his wife, about which the producer, Tony Clarke, said that Ray should fight with his wife more often!! The last one, `The Balance' is a collaboration between him and Graeme Edge, the drummer, who wrote the spoken words read by Mike Pinder. It's a tale about a man that rests below a tree at night and looking to the stars he finds the harmony and perfection of the Universe and changes his life forever.<br />If you feel touched by the meaning of this songs you are a fan of the Moody Blues already, `cos their music is even better. Any of the `Seven Classic' albums (from 1967 to 1972) is perfect for knowing this band. No other one has the same of a huge soul as the Moody Blues.om any other great band, they dare to say things that other bands don't, busy trying to catch the eyes of people just for commerciality.

B00009UW0N|5.0|In 1978, the world was introduced to a movie that has become a cornerstone in the horror genre. Independent filmmakers John Carpenter and Debra Hill, largely unknown at the time, shot a movie that would become one of the top money-making horror films of all time on a budget of just over $300,000.00. They hired a cast of unknowns, drawing on talent that would become some of the top names in Hollywood. They set out to make a simple film, about a group of teenagers being stalked by a serial killer, and what was born was a movie that has challenged all other films of its genre-Halloween.<br />Set in the small town of Haddenfield, Illinois, it is the story of Michael Myers, a boy who murders his sister on Halloween night in 1963. Incarcerated within the confines of the mental institution Smiths Grove, he is treated by Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance) until he can stand trial as an adult for the criminal activities of that fateful night.<br />Fifteen years pass, and Myers is now grown. Loomis is assigned the duty of transporting Myers back to Haddenfield for his criminal hearing. On the eve of halloween, and badgered by a horrendous thunderstorm, Loomis travels the final distance to the gates of the institution with the aid of a nurse who has been assigned to him. Upon their arrival, they discover that the inmates have been set free to wonder about the confines of the sanitarium. Loomis, who has long since grown to believe that Michael Myers in the embodiment of pure evil, rushes to the gaurd post at the front gate. In his absence, Myers overtakes the nurse and steals the car.<br />Loomis cries out &quot;He's gone..the evil has gone...&quot;<br />And so begins Halloween.<br />The balance of the story takes place in Haddonfield, where a group of unsuspecting teens will have a fatal encounter with Michael Myers. Leading the cast is Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of veteran actress Janet Leigh (of &quot;Psycho&quot; fame), who plays Laurie Strode, a high-school student who begins seeing &quot;The Shape&quot;, a non-descript man dressed in a blue coverall, wearing a white mask. She sees him again and again, through the classroom window at school, in her backyard, behind bushes.<br />For the majority of horror fans who have seen this film, I need go no further. For those of you who haven't, I should go no further, for the film is definitely more than the narrative I began above. It is a story that touches on the psychological truths that our society seems to function on. Whats more, it is a film that touches at our primal fears.<br />Unlike so many films in this genre, Halloween is genuinely frightening, not because of its use of graphic gore, or visually stunning effects (there really aren't any in this film) but because it plays on the things that scare us most-the potential monster hiding in the shadows, the boogeyman. Whats more, Carpenter uses carefully placed light and shadow to really enhance the experience of his film. His soundtrack also underscores the film as a whole, bringing it to a level and intensity that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.<br />Carpenter went on to film two additional films in the franchise, the much more commercial Halloween II and Halloween III:Season of the Witch (the third installment having nothing to do with the Myer storyline). The Halloween franchise itself has given birth to a total of seven sequels, including the largely popular Halloween H20, in which Jamie Lee Curtis reprised the role of Laurie Strode. Still, it is this original film, a small budget, independent movie that was shot in the early spring (yes, leaves were brought in and scattered about to simulate the fall season) that has become a staple that is synonymous with the holiday which the movie was named after.<br />If you have reservations about this film, set them aside and watch it...especially in this 25th annviersary release, which includes a bunch of extras...but watch it with the lights on, because Michael Myers might be there, in the shadows, waiting. Halloween-the Night He Came Home-is worth the time and money. It is the film that really re-defined the horror/slasher genre, and it is the one film that really rises above the rest, setting a standard that no film that followed has ever matched.be there, in the shadows, waiting.

B00005JKNF|2.0|A previous reviewer refers to this film as a 'classical Agatha Christie whodunnit'.  I'm sorry, but this is nonsense.  Never would Agatha Christie, mistress of her craft, have written such a feeble mystery.  For a start, the murder doesn't take place until more than halfway through the film, the detective when he appears is an idiot who couldn't detect his way out of a paper bag, and it's pretty obvious from the start who the murderer is, and why she did it.  Pathetic.  The film is riddled with cliches, all the upper-class characters are grim and repressed, all the working-class characters are warm, vibrant, life-loving etc.  The film is just about worth watching for the performance of Maggie Smith, playing the only interesting character in the film, and the lovely Ivor Novello music.  As a mystery, the film is hopeless.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I think that &quot;dark side&quot; would have to be one of the best selling of all Pink Floyd and not to mention the best and highly listenable albums! Pink Floyd didn't really hit the charts until &quot;dark side&quot; was released in 1973. I think this was a somewhat experimental album for the Floyd. I was watching a documentry on this album and Roger Waters and David Gilmour talk about it being about living in the real world, polotics and government. The Wall was the first album that I heard and I fell in love with a few songs on it and then had to buy all the Pink Floyd albums, but The Dark Side of The Moon has always been a favorite and always will be. I nearly bought this album from a local cd shop and then discovered the unreal price on Amazon. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B00005B534|5.0|Adagio was an experiment for me.  I love it when my expectations are surpassed.  Every song on this disc is really awesome.  There may be an ever-so-slight Symphony X flavor, but Adagio is certainly unique.  There is a very strong classical presence here, especially with the keys.  Unlike most classical rockers, which tend to have the same drum beat in every song, Adagio maintains the ever changing element of Prog.  Singer David Readman is awesome.  His range and power is phenominal.  I consider him one of the best singers in the genre.  Stephan Forte is a world class musician, not just a great guitarist.  His solos are tasty, yet display a measure of melodic restraint.  The keys are very strong as well.  The drums are also very strong.  Again, not the typical constant doublebass that many power metal bands use.  All the songs are great, but &quot;Second Sight&quot; really gets the album off to a good start is is the most solid song on the album.  Buy this album, I HIGHLY recommend it!
B000002BFL|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Bruce Springsteen's music very much.  Many of Bruce's other CD's are filled to the brim with passion and emotion.  However, this Ghost of Tom Joad CD leaves me very cold.<br />There are twelve songs on this CD's and they all seem to move at the same lethargic pace. The bleak tone surely does not help. On many of them it is extremely difficult to make out what Bruce is singing or more appropriately, mumbling.<br />Worse yet are the songs themselves.  Most if not all of these songs lack a good melody.  Youngstown and the title track are the only ones which seem memorable after three listens. A few others catch me for a moment but then fade away due to an overly repetitive pattern and a strong lack of instrumental definition.  The guitar playing is way too quiet that it barely adds any impression to the disc.  The ocassional harmonica blasts are the only thing that keeps from dosing off from boredom.<br />It's not that I dislike it that Bruce decided to make another all acoustic recording.  Whereas Nebraska was bleak and limited to a guitar/harmonica instrumental accompanyment, at least Bruce actually put some creative stylings into those songs.  And each of those tunes moved at distinctive paces and several of them had strong melodies.  The Ghost of Tom Joad on the other hand is dull, dismal, and boring.
B00006IUNN|2.0|***PROS***<br />- Good story<br />That's it.  After two minutes of 'CHAAAAAARGE!!!!!',  excuse me, *ahem*, &quot;realistic Woo, er, war scenes&quot;, I had to actually stop the tape because I couldn't breathe, I was laughing SO hard!  While this does save this film from the dreaded one-star rating, because I morbidly appreciate 'so-bad-it's-hilarious' filmmaking as much as the next guy, it doesn't save this movie from being a complete and utter failure.  You remember those annoying scenes that whispered &quot;Woo-was-here&quot; from Face/Off?  Well, those Woo-scenes plague this film pretty much from start to finish.<br />Want to watch a GOOD Woo film?  Watch Face/Off instead.
B000002C1V|2.0|I think that the final cut is too overrated. It is not that great. It has 3 alright songs: The Fletcher Memorial Home, Southampton Dock and The Final Cut. The Fletcher Memorial Home appeared on Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, it was the only song that came of the final cut. In other words the final cut is not reccomended, I bought it because I collect all Pink Floyd CDs.<BR>It is attrochious.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Every now and then a band comes along, bringing us a great song, but only so often does a band bring us a great album.  Jet has just done that!  They are rock'n roll in it's purest form.  If you like the Beatles, the Kinks, the Who, and all those other legendary bands rolled up into one, with a touch of the in your face, Oasis attitude, then this band is for you.  After hearing &quot;Are you gonna be my girl?&quot; I went straight out and bought their album.  Money well spent.  This is one cd that won't be leaving my cdplayer for quite a while.  Maybe when they release their second album.  More of it!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Harsh critics will blast this CD for being sentimental, orchestrated and syrupy. It may be all of the above, however, CLOSER is successful and as close a product can become to being listed as \\"pop perfection\\".<br />If you're a speed metal fan, rest assured that you'll detest this release. However, don't hesitate to purchase this cd if you enjoy strong vocals complimented with solid musical arrangements evoking emotional responses from within.<br />JOSH GROBAN demonstrates on CLOSER that he is presently the top male vocalist rating above any other currently listed on the music charts.<br />The tracks on CLOSER such as WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME , PER TE and YOU RAISED ME UP could be perfectly inserted as the scores/themes for major films. For those unaware of GROBAN's artistry and vocals quality; I suggest for you to imagine a younger ANDREA BOCELLI crossed with a lyrically gifted CLAY AIKEN.<br />This is a great Adult/MOR Cd that is worth the price to own ! You will play it for years to come !
B00006V9A0|4.0|it is hard to make up a greatest hits album for nirvana<BR>but i liked the songs that were in here but there could have been way more songs maybe it could have even been a two disk set or even a dvd could have been included i gave it 4 stars because i hate courtney love. But i love nirvana there could have been way more to this greatest hits album!!
B000024D4R|2.0|I only like one song on this album: sheep. All the rest are just really not that good. I think this was an album to do good and in a way it did i suppose.

B0000CAQ27|5.0|Pink is addictive. She is a rare bread, a true artist to emerge from America during the past &quot;prefab-pop star&quot; decade.<br />On this release, PINK evolves yet again. She blends  ROCK chords / her BONAFIDE ATTITUDE with FUNK. Approve of her personality or not, you'll be impressed by this product. The hidden track &quot;HOOKER&quot; is a solid track, it could become the new anthem for females annoyed with the &quot;BRITNEYs&quot; and &quot;CHRISTINAs&quot; of the mass media/music industry.<br />PINK has pipes and knows how to deliver a lyric to her audience. She is mature and fresh. PINK is an artist that will outlive the hype. TRY THIS enables her to permanently cement her place in music.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've had this CD since it came out because I loved some of &quot;Parachutes&quot; and even appreciate it more.  I had no idea how popular Coldplay has become to be honest.  I was enjoying this CD in isolation telling friends about the amazing melody and syncopation in &quot;Clocks&quot;, the tear-jerking &quot;The Scientist&quot; and how it reminds me of lost loves in a way that other songs try, but fail from shallowness.  I'm glad Coldplay is getting a larger audience, they deserve it.  <br />&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is an amazing work of art.  Somehow Coldplay strikes emotional chords in me in a similar way to U2.  Coldplay is familiar, yet new at the same time.  It's wonderful to have a new band out that sticks to the &quot;traditional&quot; instruments of guitar, piano, drums, and bass.  I love all kinds of music including electronic music, but it's certainly nice to hear an album like &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; that upholds the rock/pop traditions while making fresh, new-sounding music.  This music is cool enough to impress younger listeners and mellow enough to be enjoyed by your parents.  I recommend it whole-heartedly.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|These songs on the album are fantastic.  A WIDE range of sound for Pearl Jam.   A must have for true Pearl Jam Fans.   And in the cd the band gives the story of all the songs and what the songs meant to them.   Its very interesting to read.   But this album is great and i recommend it a lot.
0688163173|2.0|I had never read a Dennis Lehane book until this one. I saw Mystic River, and thinking the book was probably much better than the film, I went to the bookstore to look it up. I saw this new novel there and decided to give it a try. I found the book to be a very pedestrian &quot;page turner.&quot; I didn't believe the dialogue or the situations. It seemed to be predictably confusing, and all the way to the end I was hoping I wouldn't get the anticipated &quot;Shocking twist ending.&quot; It's a gimmick that's overused. And in fact, something similar was written by William Peter Blatty; &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane.&quot; Which he made into the film &quot;The 9th Configuration.&quot;<br />It felt like the author took the easy way out to conclude the book, instead of figuring out a way to make all the convoluted goings on pay off in a less predictable way.<br />I won't judge the rest of Lehane's work based on this one, but I wish I had read something else of his first.
B00008VGL6|5.0|Martin Gore doing a 2nd solo album.......hmmmmmmmm<BR>Covering a bunch of songs....hmmmmmmm<BR>Well, it worked. And might I add that the production on this album doesn't sound like it was put together in 5 minutes.<BR>This is an album that stands apart from anything that Gore has worked on before with Depeche mode unlike Mr. Gahan with his solo effort.<BR>Martin Gore is able to capture a different sound in this album that reminds me at times of Autechre and Andrea Parker.<BR>Very good stuff!
B0000E1ALR|5.0|The Essential Bruce Springsteen distills the boss' thirty year recording career into a two-disk set.  As Mr. Springsteen notes in the linear notes, \\"one man's coffee is one man's tea is another man's whiskey\\", in which he acknowledges that some people will be disappointed that their favorite song isn't included.  That being said, there is little to argue about the quality of the songs.  From the rollicking opener \\"Blinded By The Light\\" until the poignant and uplifting closer \\"Land Of Hope & Dreams\\", every song in this collection is tremendous.  Fans of his early work will be happy with the inclusion of songs from his first two albums (none of which were included on the Greatest Hits album) and fans of his later efforts will be happy that the overlooked Tunnel Of Love & Lucky Town albums are both well represented.  Of course the classics like \\"Thunder Road\\" \\"Born To Run\\", \\"Badlands\\" & \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\" are all included and his biggest selling singles like \\"Dancing In The Dark\\", \\"Glory Days\\" and \\"Hungary Heart\\".  His Oscar winning \\"Streets Of Philadelphia\\" and three songs from 2002's The Rising fit right in nicely next to the standards.  For someone who wants a great introduction Mr. Springsteen's music, this set is a must buy.  For long time fans that already own all these songs, the album offers something for them as well.  The bonus third disk collects odds and ends as well as some unreleased recordings.  The disk opens with the rockabilly number \\"From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)\\" which was recorded for The River and eventually given to Dave Edmunds who had a minor hit with the song.  \\"The Big Payback\\" was recorded during the Nebraska sessions and was a b-side on several foreign releases of the \\"Open All Night\\" single.  \\"Help Up Without A Gun\\" was the b-side of \\"Hungary Heart\\" and this version is the only live performance ever of the song from a New Year's Eve show from Nassau Coliseum in Long Island in 1980.  The song is a fast and furious, acoustic based number.  \\"Trapped\\" was originally released on the We Are The World album and has long been a concert staple.  Written by reggae legend Jimmy Cliff, it verses are slow and airy and build to a powerful chorus.  \\"None But The Brave\\" may be the best song on the disk.  It comes from the Born In The U.S.A. period and like \\"Glory Days\\" is a song that reminisces about days gone by.  It would have fit nicely into the album.  The next two songs are both from soundtracks and are experimental numbers for Mr. Springsteen.  \\"Missing\\" is from The Crossing Guard (directed by longtime Springsteen fan Sean Penn) and contains a drum loop machine and \\"Lift Me Up\\" is from Limbo (directed by John Sayles who directed the \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\" video) and find Mr. Springsteen singing in a falsetto voice.  \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" is from an early 90's British compilation of Elvis Presley covers and Mr. Springsteen perfectly captures the essence of the King.  \\"County Fair\\" is a song from 1983 that Mr. Springsteen played for the first time ever at a show in Buffalo, NY last September.  It is a slight song with some wistful lyrics and it is easy to understand why it never made an album until before.  \\"Code Of Silence\\" is a song co-written with longtime friend Joe Grushecky and made its debut during the last few shows on his Reunion tour.  It is a great song and has extra meaning during these uncertain political times with the questions about the war in Iraq being raised.  \\"Dead Man Walkin'\\" is the title track from the Tim Robbins film and is a slow and brooding number in The Ghost Of Tom Joad vein.  The disk closes out with an acoustic version of The Rising's \\"Countin' On A Miracle\\".  A video of the song was shown at the end of concerts during the later part of The Rising tour and is a workable number that doesn't really add much to the original.  The Essential Bruce Springsteen is another great set from the Sony series and the remastering adds some life to the older songs and hopefully this willlead Sony to remaster Mr. Springsteen's entire catalog in SACD like they did to one of his influence's albums, Bob Dylan.l lead Sony to remaster Mr. Springsteen's entire catalog in SACD like they did to one of his influence's albums, Bob Dylan.
B0000CFW87|4.0|For all of us who are fans of Josh Groban, we know the man can sing. Groban's debut album had an incredible continuity with song melding into song. This third album lacks that magic. Don't get me wrong, I like the CD. but this entry never establishes a mood. <br />My favorites are most of the foreign language selections. Groban's inflection and accenting are perfect. Mi Mancherai from &quot;Il Postino&quot; featuring Joshua Bell is spellbinding. My English choices are &quot;My Confession&quot;, &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Remember When It Rained.&quot; Okay, I like this version of &quot;Broken Vow&quot; but it's over produced and Josh commits a cardinal vocal sin by singing &quot;chu&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot;  in verse. The other self-penned titles are ho-hum.<br />Alright &quot;Grobies&quot;, I'm ready for the bricks. The cover (yes, the cover) of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; is just a lackluster version of the original featured on  Secret Garden's &quot;Once in a Red Moon&quot; featuring lead vocals by Brian Kennedy and Tracey Campbell-Nation and the London Gospel Choir and an accompanying Irish Choral group.
B00005JMCN|5.0|My wife and I liked this movie so much we went back to see it again and we purchased the PBS documentary.  There is a lot that this movie doesn't tell.  My wife read the book and we learned more from the documentary.  Howard had 4 children.  His second wife was the sister-in-law of one of his sons.  Howard donated vehicles to be used for ambulences during the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.  There is a lot more to this story than could fit into a film.  Red Pollard's accident was the 2nd major accident he had in recent years.  His first almost killed him the year before.  Following the accident before the big match race between Sea Biscuit and War Admiral, the race was cancelled and rescheduled the following year.  Barring changes in the timeline and missing information, this is still a great movie.<br />Some of the reviews weren't as kind.  But then again, everyone can't like a movie, that is why there are so many bad ones made today that make big money and are forgotten in short order.  Most films made today are made to appeal to either chilren and families, or teens and young adults who crave action and fast paced movies.  The remaining gems are cast upon the water and once in awhile they find they way to adults who appreciate them for what they are.  An adult movie with a good story and flawed characters.  These films are the ones to cherish.  Field of Dreams, October Sky, and now Seabiscuit.  After all, when the other films are long since forgotten, this film will be a classic.  This is an intelligent film.  Twice in the movie theatre people in our audiance applauded.  Once after the big race and again at the end of the movie.  How often does that happen?  And yes, there were even some young teens there that enjoyed the film.<br />P.S.  The narration is one of the best parts of this movie.  It gives a perspective to the period and ourselves at a different time.
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you like screaming, rap, or wanna get out of your old boring daily life, this will definetly do the trick. Meteora usually starts out with a rap then of course, Chester, the coolest one in LP brings out his voice, and you have a masterpeice right there. I'm sooo in love with this CD, I haven't left the house without it. If I don't listen to do this in the morning, i'm gonna have a bad day. My two favorite songs are Faint and Numb, also Don't Stay and Breaking The Habit are pretty cool. So if you hate LP (who could hate them?) then I suggest getting your braincheck, cause without LP, the world would be a boring place.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|The first part of the CD is mostly meaningless pop, and I have to be honest, I detest Dido, so seeing her name for me is not an endorsement, but from the Pointer Sisters' &quot;Jump&quot; on, the CD is flawless. <br />I was disgusted to see amazon.com DOESN'T have the Billy Mack and Olivia Olson songs listed- I'dve preordered the album if that had been listed, but rest assured, the movie's most important track is indeed on the soundtrack. <br />Joni Mitchell is a revelation. <br />This is the feel good album of Christmas. See the movie too!
B000002G7G|5.0|After being impressed by \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" I decided its time for another VU album.  Having \\"Sunday Morning\\" my favorite song off of VU&N I figured this album was the one for me.  Needless to say I'm more then impressed with this album, its much more mature then their previous work and while most of the songs are slowed they are far from boring.  They just don't rush anything, its simply interesting arrangements and beautifully thoughtful lyrics that make this album not only captivating but nearly addictive.  If your a rock and roll fan, this CD belongs in your collection.
0156027321|2.0|This long-winded and unconvincing novel begins with an &quot;Author's Note&quot; in which the unnamed narrator informs us that he is an ARTIST, and his fellow-citizens should pay an arts bureaucracy to support him in replacing their &quot;crude reality&quot; and &quot;worthless dreams&quot; with works of his imagination.  I know many Canadians, and am delighted to say that they need a caste of &quot;artists&quot; to provide them with dreams the way a fish needs a bicycle.  As for the story...<br />The narrator actually presents us with two stories, neither of which is especially convincing.  In one, a young man and his mother are trapped on a lifeboat with a cannibal cook, the last a survival expert whose amazing knife (it MUST be a Ginsu!) is capable of both dressing meat and chopping off heads.  After the cook has for no particular reason created a raft out of oars and chopped off the mother's head, the plucky lad wrests the cook's knife away and slowly chops him to bits.  The other story is invested with a good deal more versimilitude - up to a point.  In THAT story, the young man must manage a powerful but unpredictable being who can be palliated, but never entirely tamed, through offerings.  However that story also contains blatantly unbelievable nonsense.  &quot;Which story,&quot; we are asked, &quot;Do you prefer?&quot;  Well neither, but I'm an agnostic...<br />I found the author's point to be heavy-handed and rather naive.  In addition there is a good deal of misplaced humour in the book - I won't say it isn't amusing, but Mr. Martel might have been better advised to keep the Mutt and Jeff routines and ditch the religious speculation.<br />The book does raise one worthwhile question, but I think the book itself is the answer to it.  Should government 'arts' bureaucracies create and support a separate caste of &quot;artists&quot;, or should artists be ordinary citizens, discovering art through participation in real life?  More real life would have helped this book.  Citizens should support, not their artists, but their art.  Those who rely on others' imaginations live worthless lives, and realize crude dreams.s book.

068484267X|4.0|This is the type of book which no film can capture the atmposphere of - a truly sad yet funny story at the same time. I tried to read it twice - the first time i just read the lines &quot;... worse still is the miserable Irish childhood&quot; and didn't really give the book much of a chance. Then my friend encouraged me to read it as she said it was funny and so I decided to give it another chance.I started laughing on the second page in - it was fantastic. I feel the film gives it little justice - as though the book is sad - it deals with survival and humour rather than just sadness. It captures the attention through telling it's story through the eyes of a child - a truly entertaining, human yet funny book.
1400049628|4.0|In 1997, I survived what this book describes as a &quot;Class One&quot; outbreak of the Solanum, or &quot;zombie,&quot; virus. I am currently ateending a weekly support group for similar individuals. We discussed this book at our last meeting, and the unanimous consensus is that this guide is an invaluable resource in preparing for and surviving a zombie outbreak. From both my own personal experience and the stories of others, I know for a fact that following the directions contained in this guide can mean the difference between life and death, or worse, walking death. In addition, many of the preparation techniques have become a part of my daily regimen in the years following my ordeal.<BR>However, this guide does possess one failing: When distinguishing between victims of the Solanum virus and so-called &quot;voodoo zombies,&quot; the author severely downplays the danger inherent in encountering one of these creatures. While it is true that voodoo zombies do not consume human flesh or transmit their condition to the living, they are nonetheless often in the employ of amoral and dangerous individuals, who will not hesitate to use them as part of illegal and evil acts. A member of my group, a survivor of such an incident, was very vocal in her condemnation of that section of the book. Furthermore, if organizations hostile to the United States were ever to obtain and replicate a sample of the so-called &quot;zombie powder&quot; used in the creation of these creatures, the supposedly impossible situation of a zombie army directed against America could well become a reality. Thus, in good conscience, I cannot give this book a full five stars.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Well, I haven't reviewed anything in ages, so I might as well make it a review for the newest album by one of my favorite bands.  This is great, great stuff.  Some of their heaviest and best riffs yet, and the solos really kill as well.  &quot;As I Am&quot;, &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;, &quot;In the Name of God&quot;, heck, pretty much every song here is amazing.  I really can't stop listening to this thing.  If you want some really good heavy stuff, you need to buy this right away.  Leave &quot;St. Anger&quot; on the shelf, because this here is the real deal.  Dream Theater is still on top, and they're makin it rock.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|After watching this never before released (in The U.S.) AC/DC concert from Castle Donington, I was amazed at the sound quality of this dvd. But after watching it several times and watching Angus Young's fingers doing his fancy fretwork, I sadly realized that parts of this concert have been doctored. That's the reason for the excellent sound, alot of overdubs. On certain songs it's obvious Anguses guitar riffs have been tampered with and cleaned up. His fingers don't match what he's playing on a number of songs. Nonetheless, it all sounds great, but was it really necessary? Possibly the original concert tapes were of inferior quality and this was part of the reason for the \\"cleaning up\\" as so to speak. The concert itself is amazing with Angus running back and forth doing his famous goosewalk as he strums his Gibson SG Standard guitar. The energy level certainly never lets up and the entire band sounds great. Singer Brian Johnson's voice fits well with even the earlier AC/DC Bonn Scott material such as \\"Jailbreak\\", \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\", \\"Highway To Hell\\", \\"The Jack\\", \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\", etc. Since this concert was filmed in 1991 AC/DC include a few of their songs from the new (at the time) \\"Razor's Edge\\" album such as \\"Thunderstruck\\", and \\"Fire Your Guns\\". There are the usual songs such as \\"Back In Black\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" all from their 1980 \\"Back In Black\\" album as well as a few from other albums such as \\"Heatseeker\\" and the anthem \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\". The picture quality is also excellent on this dvd which by the way is two hours long. There's also a colorful booklet included with the dvd which includes AC/DC's 1991 \\"Razor's Edge\\" tour dates as well as information about the Castle Donington concert. I would recommend this dvd to all AC/DC fans as well as heavy metal rock lovers worldwide.

B00003CXZ3|5.0|&quot;Memento&quot; is one of the most intriguing films! i've only heard of this film THIS YEAR!, 2003!, 3 years later! My friend who told me about it said it was &quot;f*?ked up!&quot;, and i understand why she says that, but its F-ed up in a good way. I'm not gonna tell you what it's about, because i know i'll spoil it :) so i'll jus tell u what i think and how i felt.<br />i'm sooooo sick of films that are predictable. Since watching &quot;Identity&quot;, &quot;The MAtrix 1,2,3&quot; to name but a few, i've become so into confusing thrillers and films that remained with you for a while and kept you interested. it was very refreshing to see another film like that, but it seperates itself from the pack! This is like none other! It's on a whole new level, just like The Matrix is! i like how the film, makes u, well it made me be a part of the film, and i felt it wanted me to feel how lenny felt-the frustration, confusion, anguish, also the HOW and WHY, did this just happen? backwards style, the film is filmed, which kinda mirrors his condition. Absolute class! <br />This is one excellent film, but it's not for everyone. If ur a sucker for action-packed, big blockbusters etc, this isn't for you, but if you're willing to see something different, you can't get anymore different! It's so unique-in it's own way- and original. There will never be a film like this again. It's a shame not a lot of people have heard about this film, myself and many of my friends and family being an example! The acting is very good. Guy really does capture his character very well. I couldn't believe this guy used to act in something as sad as NEIGHBOURS!! lol. He has a come a looooong way! Joe and Carrie are also very good!!<br />P.S It's a &quot;thinking film&quot;, so you might need to see it more than once, if you're not used to those kinda films. It is confusing. Don't be put off though, cos there are comprehendable parts! It's just putting the jigsaw together. If u are that sucker, i'll think you'll convert. Confusing films are a lot more fun! lol j/k Have patience! it's bloody worth it!
0316286850|5.0|I bought this book since make-up has always been fascinating for me and wanted to learn some more before taking a professional course. I was complete surprised about the possibilities that make up can do with your face. I never thought that the correct application of colors and lighting could change in such a way a person. The way Mr. Aucoin makes it it's really incredible... you don't even need a plastic surgery to be as beautiful as many of the stars we see in the movies. It is really an art. And the instructions of how to do it are very practical to do at home.<BR>I would recommend it for any person who has interest in learning how to improve her appeareance and for make-up learning.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh has definitely not only done it again but even better. The CD has all the passion, pathos, and perfectly presented orchestration as the first. The lyrics are wonderful, too. We should all hope to approach life with such eagerness and enthusiasm. This album is both inspiring and exciting to me. The operatic pieces are equally great, as well.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Sometimes a person wants to be taken to a higher plane, somewhere above the mediocrity that all too often surrounds us.<br />That's what Josh's CD does for me each time I've listened to it. His voice is perfection; the songs he sings are soaring and haunting and beautiful. There is nothing of mediocrity here.<br />You cannot go wrong by buying this CD. And then the next time you want to surround yourself with something that will make this world seem a bit better, a bit brighter, you'll have the right CD to play.<br />Thank you, Josh. Beautiful and well done.
B00000HZFH|5.0|I saw Built to Spill in concert for the first time last month. Needless to say, it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to. What truly stuck me about Dug was his stage presence or lakc thereof. He would go through song after flawless song, the crowd would go nuts, and then he would nervously thank them as if he never saw their reaction coming. More than any other band, Built to Spill let their music speak for itself. Keep it Like a Secret is the brilliant climax of their damn near perfect three album run that started with there's nothing wrong with love. Honest lyrics, perfect pop melodies, blazing guitar solos, theyre all here. Everysong is a highlight and a potential single. Still, the glue that holds this together is the honesty and emotion of Dug. He once said that he resents being called a guitar hero. He said in an interview that there are probably ten-thousand people in this country that can play better than him. Even if he's too shy to admit it, we know it's true and if its not because of his technical prowess (which still is pretty impressive) than its the fact that he's one of the most inventive minds to ever pick up the instrument.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I've just bought this DVD as an important part of my collection,and I definitely recomend this  title to be part of yours..!!<BR>I last saw this movie about 15 years ago ,and when I saw it again last night it was sacriest than ever!!<BR>For sure you  will see one of the  most breath taking finales  in movie history.....
B00005YXZH|5.0|This might not have been my favorite release of the year but it was deffinately the most important. Mythology aside, this is a tremendous leap foward for a band that has made a habit of taking tremendous leaps foward with each album since their debut. At this point, Wilco are pretty much invincable, tackling alt-country, roots rock, Beatlesque pop, and Classic rock all with stagering results. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot combines each of these elements (well not so much the country) with super-producer Jim O'Rorque's work which is both vaguely familiar and entirely new and brilliant. The band opens the album with I am Trying to Break Your Heart which sets the same kind of atmosphere that characterized Grandaddy's awesome debut Under the Western Freeway. This album is far from being a downer though with songs that are both uplifting and upbeat. I don't think that the Radiohead meets Johny Cash comparison is valid but YHF is equally as important as both those artist's best album. An event like this only comes around once every three or four years so please don;t miss out. But waht am I talking about, its almost 2004. You should know all this by now.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|First off, if you have not heard by now, this is Dream Theater's heaviest album EVER! I do not understand what these so called &quot;fans&quot; of DT are whining about. I mean do we really expect DT to sound like they did more than 10 years ago when Images and Words was released?! With each album DT releases, the fans never know what to expect. Because DT changes... they evolve... they experiment. But NEVER have they disappointed this fan. Aside from what some reviewers may let on, Train of Thought is not DT's version of &quot;Load&quot;(metallica). This is an amazing album! It does not compare to Scenes from a memory, but it buries the bands last effort. <BR>There are a number of interesting influences heard in this album. Bands like Mudvayne and Rush are the more obvious influences. Some may just be coincidence. For instance, one part off of track two sounds like it belongs on Metallica's &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; CD. Because of the unlikely influences some may say ToT is too Nu-Metalish. I say, &quot;This is Dream Theater!&quot; If they want to add a touch of nu-metal style riffage then let them. They will only back it up with incredible playing that no nu-metal band can even come close to touching. So, suffice to say, all the excellent musicianship you come to expect is there. Petrucci takes center stage on this album. I do not know what happened to him, but its obvious that something made him want to show people that he is one of the greatest guitarists of our time once again. It seems his solos have taken a more speed metal approach. They all lack melody, however it is made up for by the unreal speed and accuracy of his picking. Myung is much easier to hear this time around, and Portnoy is still god. I must say i was a bit disappointed with Rudess's playing. He is an amazing pianist/keyboardist but he just doesn't show off enough on ToT. As for James...personally I don't mind his singing on this album. Yes it is different. Yes, he does a bit of RATM style rapping in one song, but it fits. I am a fan of his and always loved his voice. <BR>I was expecting a change of sound on Train of Thought. But that change, in my opinion, is for the better. Their talent as musicians is amazing, and this album shows. Whether or not they return to the days of I&amp;W, who cares. ToT contains some great songs with incredible playing. And if they put out a Train of Thought II, I will be first in line to pick it up! So, Dream Theater, if you guys read this, I just want to say thank you for releasing an awesome album!!

B000002KHH|5.0|If you didn't grow up in the Sixties and Seventies, &quot;Paranoid&quot; will not be as big a deal to you as it was to me.  Creem Magazine viewed Black Sabbath as the alternative rockers of the post-Woodstock world.  The first album was a fascinating, amateurish but uniquely dark roar.  &quot;Paranoid,&quot; released just six months later, made an amazing leap. The first two Sabbath albums came out just a few months after the first two Led Zeppelin records.  Between the two, they invented coliseum rock.  Both defined cool and glorified excess.<br />&quot;Paranoid&quot; was a voice for everyone who did not fit in with hippie love mush. &quot;War Pigs&quot; gave me chills the first time I heard the intro with Tony Iommi's feedback guitar beneath a wonderfully timed air raid siren. Ozzy Osborne does not whine about kids at Kent State, he spits fire about the warmongers whom he portrays as pure evil. This is a wonderfully constructed piece of metal with hooks that rockers have been borrowing every day since.<br />&quot;War Pigs,&quot; &quot;Paranoid,&quot; &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; broke ground on the rock guitar, bass, percussion and vocals that made Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins and many others possible. Like any great album, &quot;Paranoid&quot; must be heard in sequence to capture its unsettling identity. For me as a youth, it was like the first puffs on a cigarette: made me dizzy, made me queasy, made me scared, made me want more.

B0000E1ALR|4.0|Good disc.  I'm On Fire gets no recognition;  a big hit in the 80's...oh well.  The liner notes state that Trapped was recorded during The River Tour.  This is same version on the USA for Africa compilation which was recorded at the L.A Sports Arena in 1984.  (Patty also is singing background.)  A minor goof, but still great to have it on a new Bruce compilation.  For those who are expecting a different version, think not.

But really, I found his review of the situation to be as much as anybody else.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The best review of this trilogy &gt;&gt;&gt;  &quot;I know I was not alone in the feeling of excitement that was created when the first installment of the Matrix trilogy was released a few years ago. There, on big screens all across the globe, was a movie daring to tell the truth about the perceptual prison that humanity finds itself trapped in. While many appreciated the movie for its stunning looks and breakthrough special effects, what made the Matrix film so successful was its ability to twist your mind as much as the now famous &quot;bullet cam&quot; twisted your view. The final installment leaves the unlearned observer with a stunning illustration of what can only be understood as Illuminati sabotage.&quot; <BR>   If you are interesting in reading the full page review of the Betrayed Trilogy go to unlearning.org and click on WHATS NEW to read the latest editorial.<BR>   The first MATRIX is the the ONLY ONE.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Movie Review:<br />I really, truly, thought the magic was gone when I heard that Jim Cameron wasn't going to work on this project. I've never been so happy to be wrong. Mostow did an incredible job meeting the high expectations that fans have for this series.<br />I'm not going to talk about the plot for fear of revealing too much, but I will say that this is the movie where John Connor finally meets his destiny. This is where the questions and issues of a time paradox (ex: If Judgment Day never happened how did John's father come back in time? Would he never have existed?) are finally answered (intelligently I might add).<br />And of course, Arnold (or Governor Arnold now I guess) absolutely IS the Terminator. I don't think I have EVER seen a role more perfectly cast.<br />If there I had any complaints at all, it was mostly just for what I felt I was missing then anything. I never thought I'd say this about an action movie, but I really wish there was a bit more dialogue and characterization for John Connor. As I said before, this is THE MOMENT when he becomes the man he was destined to be. I would have LOVED just a couple of extra minutes to watch him make the transition into the role. <br />I'm holding out hope that extra footage will be added to the DVD. I really got the impression that T3 was made with a strict eye on the clock. The first two Terminator movies are around two hours (more for T2), T3 clocked in for almost exactly an hour and a half, if I remember right. I honestly think that a lot was left on the cutting room floor; I'd love to see some of it integrated back into the movie.<br />Again, 4 out of five stars. It's a very solid third entry into this wonderful sci-fi saga. <br />DVD Review:<br />Where in the world are all of the extra features?  I was very disappointed to learn that there wound up being only one cut scene.  It's a totally ridiculous explanation of how Arnold became the model for the Terminator and a much needed explanation for how thegovernment came into possession of Cyberdyne's research.  It's really a horribly done scene that I'm glad was removed.  It really would have detracted from the movie.  Add in a few trailers and an HBO documentary, and that's about the extent of the goodies.<br />Although nothing has been mentioned of yet, I really have a strong feeling that there's going to be some kind of box set coming soon.  If you were thinking about buying this DVD, I'd be inclined to rent it.  I have the strong scent of a trilogy re-release ...
B00009TB5G|4.0|I really enjoyed LOTR books, and so far, have enjoyed the movies. Some people don't like this movie because they haven't read the books and have the attention span of a gnat (not their fault, but still there). Some people didn't like it because it wasn't \\"Tolkien enough\\". A few things I have noticed about other reviews and what they meant to me....<BR>\\"Faramir not being noble and wise\\". Some people have stated that they thought that Faramir taking Frodo to Osgiliath(sp?) meant that his character was betrayed. No, it didn't happen in the book, but Yes, it's still Faramir. If Faramir was not wise and noble, he wouldn't have let Frodo leave at all. Love it or hate it, the only reason that Mr. Jackson did it this way was because it gives him a more human character. He thinks that taking the ring back is a good idea, has some time to think about it and realizes that it needs to be destroyed. If he were just to say \\"I don't want it\\" it would have reduced the impact that Boromir had when he succumbed to power of the Ring, just making Boromir weak and easily swooned. This way, it shows that Faramir was wise and noble by showing a conflict and him overcoming the temptation to take the ring. <BR>Also, many people think it should have stayed true to the book more, but how Peter saw it (and Christopher Lee, who was said to read the books once a year, and is a MAJOR purist) and how I see it is that there are so many things in the books that either would detract from the story, or would just be plain stupid put on screen (I see Tom Bombadil being like this... I mean, it would be Barney-esk), so they didn't include them. Anything they added has been to add a little more intruque/conflict/interest for people that haven't read the book. 80% of the book is intact, 20% new stuff added. Actually, for the first time this has ever come to the screen, it has been done masterfully.<br />I will leave with this point:<BR>If you don't like how it was done and want to bash it, where's your version of it? Take it for what it is, not what you want it to be. \\"Those who expect everything will be sorely disappointed, those who expect nothing will be pleasantly surprised.\\"

B00003CY6M|4.0|Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack are so enjoyable as fated lovers in this wonderful romantic comedy.   Great supporting cast, fun twists and a general sense of &quot;aww!&quot; pervades the entire movie.  It's one you'll want to purchase and watch over and over.  Although the portrayal of New york in Christmas is sometimes questionable (i.e., girl walking down street in short sleeved shirt and scarf) it's a very cute look at fate and how sometimes we have to look at signs as more than a coincidence.
B00005JM02|5.0|My mom bought this for my 2,4,&amp; 10 yr old. It is the one movie that they can agree on. It is also very funny for adults, but be prepared! My kids now run thru the house screaming, &quot;mine,mine&quot;, (ie the seagulls). But there are no dirty words or graphic scenes even in death, always a plus w kids. The supplemental stuff was lacking in my opinion, but I am big LOTR fan &amp; used to big extras on DVD. My 10 yr old did like the info you can learn about fish, but I thought if you are going to add deleted scenes, then animate them.
1567407757|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a wonderful story about life and living life to make you happy. Morrie is a retired sociology professor that has been diagnosed with ALS which is a terminal illness.  Mitch, one of Morrie's favorite students hears of this news a starts to visit Morrie on tuesdays.  In the book we learn how important it is to be happy with our career, family, basically in all aspects of life.  One of the major themes is to be loving.  We will die with out love, not a physical death like Morrie's but a death of the soul.  This story is a tear jerker that examines life through the eyes of a dying man and shows how short life really is.  We don't all get a chance to mend relationships before we die, so when we have the chance to while we are living we should do so.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is by far one of the Best movies i have ever seen, it is simply incredible...<BR>First, i would like to say that i read some of the negative reviews that claim that some things weren't realistic...THey are completly missing the point! Wether or not these TINY details are realistic really does NOT matter AT ALL, there is so much more to the movie, how can anyone possibly focus on an insignificant thing like that?<BR>The story, i'll let you find that out by yourself, but i can tell you this much: The acting is unbelievable (i couldn't believe how good Wayans was), Jared Leto has always been an incredible actor, and he proves it in this movie, he gives such a powerful and emotional performence. Ellen Burstyn (i cant believe JULIA ROBERTS beat her, their performences were incomparable), she does such a great job at portraying a TV crazed Speed Addict (who doesn't even realize she is). Jennifer Connely was stunning, you can tell she's a really great actress. <BR>THe Director is a genuis, like many people have already said , watching this movie kinda makes you feel like you're on a trip yourself. The scenes depicting the actual intake of the drugs were really original and gripping, you'll see what i'm talking about!<BR>I will admit this movie made me cry, the end is just unbelievably sad...<BR>I dont understand how anybody can even think about touching drugs after watching this movie (but this is besides the point)...<br />I don't know what else to say, GO WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW....it's a masterpiece.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a wonderful tale about a retired sociology teacher that has just been diagnosed with ALS. One of his favorite students, Mitch hears of this news and begins to visit morrie on tuesdays, and Morrie teaches Mitch a final course,life.  This is a wonderful tale about life through the eyes of a dying man.  Morrie see's life as something that we should not take for granted and in order to live happily we must be forgiving, and most importantly loving.  This wonderful story is a tear jerker and brings up a lot of angst that we all have about death.  Death is a reality and pretending that it will go away is not the answer in coping with it.  Morrie touched my heart in that he made me realize that life is to short to waste it away holding grudges and not doing what makes you happy.  We all do not get the chance to repair and mend relationships before we die.  This book also tought me that coping with the tribulations of life is not all that bad. If someone looking at death head on can cope with life, and still smile and give so much love to those around him so can I.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS was toted as being the conclusion to &#34;The Matrix&#34; set of films. It was supposed to have all these unbelievable effects, topping off what had been a break through trilogy in filmmaking. It was also supposed to tie all the loose ends of the series and end the war between the machines and the humans. Well, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS filled most those predictions.<br /><br />The film does have some amazing special effects. For example, the fight in Zion, taking a cue from the best of war films, is an amazing piece of cinematic brilliance. Everything in those scenes, from the score to the sounds to the lack of dialogue, unite together to form a magnificent display that illustrates both the humanity of Zion's citizens and the directorial power of the Wachowski brothers. The film does tie together many of the loose ends that were purposely left undone in THE MATRIX RELOADED and the movie does end the war between the humans and the machines.<br /><br />However, just as THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS displays the skill the Wachowski's have as directors, it also blatantly illustrates their lack of skill as writers. To begin with, the dialogue is terrible. Poor Mr. Reeves was beginning to break away from the &#34;Bill and Ted&#34; image that has haunted him throughout his career. THE MATRIX re-launched his career. In the first two movies we saw some emotion and some good acting. Then this film comes along: in some of his most emotional scenes, he's given dialogue that is plain awful which makes him sound like the old surfer from the 80s we all love. Hardly any of the other actors fare better, except perhaps for The Oracle and Agent Smith.<br /><br />Not only that, but even though THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS fulfills predictions and lives up to part of the hype, the film ultimately fails to bring true resolution. There is no catharsis. The film ends, but one leaves the theatre feeling cheated. The end of the movie leaves open the possibility of future films or perhaps a television series of some sort. That's not how it was supposed to be.<br /><br />THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS wasn't anything like I thought it would be. It makes the previous film, THE MATRIX RELOADED, a quite better film in comparison. There is no catharsis. Things aren't the same and the matrix still exists. Go figure.haps a television series of some sort.

B00005JKC3|5.0|This is the first time I've seen the Hulk, and I was blown away by it!  Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors, is there nothing he can't do?  The Hulk, a monster fulled by rage, could have been so easily overdone by any director.  But Ang Lee tells the story perfectly.  The editing is increadble in this film!  It should be required viewing for any editor.  Ang Lee has fun with this film, and the edits show it.  But they do more than show it, they work!  He breaks rules left and right (see if you can count how many times the 'line is crossed' in this film) and yet it still works.  The cuts are extremely creative and a thing of beauty.  The acting is supurb!  And the body language of the Hulk is nuanced.  I can't say enough about this film.  Compared to any of the other action/sci-fi films out there (Matrix Re-whatever, Kill Bill) it beats them hands down with the acting and character development.
B000002KKD|5.0|Looking for something fun?  Look no further - the whole point of the B-52's is fun with a grove, something that will make you smile as you sing along, and make you just wanna dance!  :-)
B00000099Y|5.0|this album is definately my favorite tool album.  it is a mesmorizing mix of tools creative style and flat out hard core rocking.  its the type of album that you can put on and listen to the whole thing without changing tracks.  my favorite song is definately &quot;eulogy&quot; (#2), which kicks ass.  thank god for tool.
B00000K3G8|5.0|This is a band that I fell in love with the first time I heard their music!  I was fortunate and saw them at a small venue during the Stop Making Sense tour!  They were fantastic, the music was fantastic, and the presentation was fantastic!<br />It's all captured here!  If you love the Talking Heads you probably already own this and get it - if you've got to ask, you never will!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I love bands that challenge themselves and constantly evolve, but I must say that I was not expecting such a brutal and dark album from Dream Theater - one of their best yet.  If you are a true DT fan, you will love this album.  If you are one of those people who think Images &amp; Words is the only good album they ever did and that it will never be topped, then go buy the next Symphony X album.  I'll take DT over them any day of the week.<br />DT is one of those rare bands (like Rush) that can incorporate new styles and expand on the rock/metal genre while still sounding like themselves.  This album is much different than their others, but if I turned the radio on to the middle of one of these songs, I would know it was them immediately.  They are progressing as they ever have been, and taking the current trends and making them their own, using them the way they should be used.  All the mainstream Nu Metal bands should pick up this CD and hear how it's really done.<br />My favorite tracks are &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; (the continuance of &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; from 6 Degrees - they use some of the same riffs/lyrics) and &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;, though all the songs are awesome.  The midway point of &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; is so brutal (Don't cross the crooked step!) - I can't wait to see them live again.
B0000B3FCX|1.0|Nickelback is subhuman. Quite literally, this is music by cavemen for cavemen. I was going to compare Nickelback's songs to &quot;Bah Bah Black Sheep&quot; but I think that would be a misrepresentation -- &quot;Bah Bah Black Sleep&quot; is far more musically sophisticated. Actually, if you give a caveman an electric guitar, he will probably write better songs than the Nickelback guy because he is not chained to the modern Zeitgeist of three-chord gorilla-rock, three-note vocal melodies, and pathetic drummers that barely navigate an eighth-note rock beat (and even then with zero variation). It's not even a matter of the music being pathetically basic (it's a contingent relationship rather than a necessary one) -- the music is just flat-out crappy. The lyrics approach new standards of verbal diarrhea, and yet with the way certain lines are emphasized you just KNOW they *think* they write really clever lyrics. There is probably a praxeological axiom that states Nickelback is the worst band in the world.
B00005BL2A|5.0|After reading the other reviews here, I need to add my opinion and hopefully help to raise the rating for this album.  After having listened to it many times since it was released, I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I think some of the people that don't like this album do not appreciate some of the more subtle tracks.  There's a lot going on in these songs.  I heard Dream On on the radio while in my car and it does lose a lot when not able to hear it well.  Many of these songs do not make good background music, and I consider that a good thing.  In my opinion, a song can be tremendously interesting and powerful without having to be a overly radio-friendly, loud, or otherwise obvious and I don't consider any of the tracks on this album to be boring in the least.  One of the things that I like the most about this album is that many of the tracks have so much great stuff going on all at once.  However, not all of that is overly-obvious; this isn't background music.  I also enjoy that the album sounds fairly experimental and different and I would have been very disappointed if the album had sounded like an attempt at mainstream music.<br />I like all the songs on the album tremendously, but would say that The Sweetest Condition is the best.  Other particularly good ones are Shine, The Dead of Night, Comatose, I Feel Loved, and Breathe.<br />Violator is a great album, but rate this one higher because there's simply more going on in these songs making them even more interesting to listen to.<br />While there are no D.M. CD's that I'd rate below a 4 (except their first would be a 3), this one definitely deserves a 5 (along with Black Celebration).  I like this album on its own merits and would still rate it as a 5 even if I was not a D.M. fan.
6305280762|4.0|\\"The Towering Inferno\\" is a truly entertaining film which, despite following what has become a clich&eacute;d \\"disaster\\" plot, manages to hold the attention of the audience despite special effects that have long been improved upon.  In fact, as other reviewers have mentioned, these films could not completely rely upon special effects to solidify ticket sales-despite the fact that, for the time, the effects were top-notch.  Instead, a solid script, interesting turns of events, and suspense drive this movie.  At certain points, I was utterly shocked at the portrayal of death in this film; I could not see several of them coming.  Despite the fact that death scenes are far more accurately rendered in more recent films, there is something about a \\"hidden\\" death that plays upon our imaginations.  Rather than focus upon the gore, a subtle pan of the camera or long shot will bring the audience away from the action and leave our minds to fill in the blanks.  This technique, while arising from a lack of ability to render death, actually succeeds far beyond the relatively tame death to which we have become accustomed.<br />Steve McQueen.  Need I say more?  It is hard to deny the presence that McQueen brings to every film that he is in.  Acting ability?  Sure...but he's best at playing himself and, quite frankly, that's who I want to see.  But what I enjoyed about this movie is that Paul Newman's performance truly rises above McQueen's charisma and holds up the entire film.  And yet, at the same time, these two actors are able to work together in what could have been a duel between two great personalities.<br />Like many disaster films of the era, the deaths are to a certain extent predictable.  But several people die that you are routing for along the way.  And more importantly, several people that you find detestable will not be suitably punished, at least as they are in modern films.  For these reason, \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is still entertaining and definitely worth viewing.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have been listening to Dream Theater ever since I heard a few of the members went to the same high school as me (Kings Park High School) and I have always been a fan.  However, I didn't buy all their albums because, even though I truly appreciate their immense talent, I sometimes found their music a little boring, especially on the last few albums.  But then....<BR>   Dream Theater came out with this masterpiece, Train of Thought!!!   Holy cow, are these guys pissed off or something?  Because they certainly sound and play like it on the album.  Petrucci's guitar is really in the forefront here, and he plays like a madman.  His solos are blindingly fast, which would mean nothing in other guitarists hands that don't have the sense of melody and timing that he has.  They also finally boosted up John Myung's bass playing in the mix, so we finally get to hear how amazing this guy is.  He sounds like Steve Harris from Iron Maiden on speed!!  And then, of course, there is Portnoy, who portrays such a sense of power with his drum kit...its out of this world.  Jordan Rudess is also great, and I really appreciate the fact that he doesn't overplay because keyboards are often overdone in these type of albums.  LaBrie's voice is the best I've ever heard him sing on this album...he shows alot of emotion, including...anger?<BR>   As far as the songs go, there is not a weak one in the bunch.  They are all heavier than any other Dream Theater song, and I can tell these guys are getting back in touch with their roots (I can hear traces of old Metallica, Yngwie, and Rush in the songs).  \\"As I Am\\" is a \\"radio-friendly\\" song, but don't expect to hear it on the radio.  It's tight but still has that progressive DT sound.  \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" is a great instrumental piece, with an epic sounding melody heard throughout.  \\"In the Name of God\\", which closes the album, powerfully expresses the horrible stuff that's going on in the world right now.  All the songs are just killer, and unique beyond any other progressive metal act out there right now.<BR>    DT has made me a bigger fan with this album.  They finally found some true passion in their music, and they are taking no prisoners.  So, stay away from that candy-a**, wimpy bubble gum music I've been hearing on the radio lately, and go buy this album!!!<BR>Here is an update:  I'm reading some negative reviews, most of them based on the opinion that \\"this doesn't sound like DT\\".  Well, DT started out as and, in my opinion, have always been progressive METAL artists, not progressive rock.  SO, yeah, this is a progressive metal album, maybe a little heavier than their other stuff, but still DT.  If you want to hear progressive rock, go listen to Yes or Queen, or whatever. At least DT hasn't sold out like Metallica.  They hold on relentlessly to their roots, even if they have grown a huge fan base that probably also find elevator music appealing. Those people giving this album a bad review seem to be so narrow minded, and old.  Seems like the age of the average DT fan is somewhere around 45, and likes to snooze away in his cushy office while getting hypnotized by the opening lyrics of SFAM.  Well, maybe this album will change that, and light a fire under those teenage kids who think Lump Buzkut (or whatever its called) is metal, and also hopefully inspire some original technical music again.
0451169514|2.0|The first novel I ever read was Carrie it was flawless! unfortunately things went down from there.  For some reason Mr. King thought that by adding 500 to 600 pages to a story that's 300 to 500 pages long would make it better. WRONG! \\"It\\" the book is long winded, no exaggeration. He might as well put in the history of his characters first booger they ever picked all the way up to adulthood.  King's trademark stock characters also lack believability (they're almost cartoonish) and they're in almost every book he's ever written.  Read: Cujo, Gerald's Game, Pet Cemetary, Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, Carrie, Different Seasons, Deloris Claibourne, instead.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|P!NK is back, and better than ever.  Her new CD, Try This, is great!  She re-defines her music yet again, going even further into the world of rock by putting a punk sound on her songs.  She sounds great, if not better than ever.  She looks fabulous, and really embodies everything that she is singing about on this album.  Some of my favorites are &quot;Trouble&quot; &quot;God is a DJ&quot; &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; &quot;Waiting For Love&quot; &quot;Humble Neighborhoods,&quot; and &quot;Unwind&quot;.  She co-wrote every song on the album with either Rancid front man Tim Armstrong, or former colaborater/4-Non Blondes front woman Linda Perry.  The music comes alive and is a great sample of what P!NK is doing in her life at this moment.<br />Highly Recommended!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This was an excellent movie in that it introduced an entirely new layer of intrigue into the Matrix series that wasn't present in the original. The fight scenes are better due to their immensity; the scene fighting Agent Smith alone put numerous CGI firms out of business. Some people don't like the fact that this film went more in depth about the matrix itself, and spotlighted the philosophical aspects of the story. However any can have unbelievable fight scenes, it's the storyline that made the firs Matrix the hit it was. So naturally the sequels will have to delve deeper into the ethos of the Matrix and how it works. The only complaint that I have is that the third movie didn't come out soon enough.
6305232660|5.0|This is a film that could easily have gone sour.  We could have had inordinate focus on the young folks or a lot of political hokum about we are all one happy family or - more likely - the majority of the movie could be spent on the impact and awful aftermath.<br />Great opening, good build up.  Tea Leoni seems made for the part of striving newswoman and her very drive opens up a secret that is as somber as it is news-worthy.  Slowly the tension rises as we wonder who will be saved (the random drawing is great) and who is condemned to perish.  Several things separate this from the usual run (say ARMAGEDDON).<br />First, our heroine does not survive but goes out in a tender scene with dad.  Second, the asteroid does hit and does destroy a large part of the Earth.  Third, we are left with a feeling of hope instead of despair and even a sense of pride.  This one deserves an &quot;A&quot;.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|ok if the title of this review wasnt enough to get you to bye this cd this should. Ok 14 songs that youve never heard before, make that 15.Ok so a few minutes after bee girl theres a tribute song to layne staley. If you hate creed and all the other bands that rip off staleys voice, and coincidently vedders, then you need to hear this song and the only way to do that is to buy this cd. Even if your not a hardcore fan you should think about buying this cd basically because its a good price for two discs and it gives you an over view of the bands entire career.
0767817478|1.0|Sometimes you can view a flick that is just so godawful that it suddenly becomes funny and entertaining.  But this is not the case here.  The writers - and man are they in need of some remedial script classes - attempt to take the whole stupid thing seriously but what can one say when the star of the movie walks like a drunk T-Rex and has no lines?<br />Hokiest science around - radiation caused something to happen to Godzilla. There's baby zillas lurking around the edges.  Anyway, skip all the &quot;scientific explanation&quot; (LOL) and let's get to the attack on New York City.  A befuddled Matthew Broderick is paired with other actors who look as embarrassed as the rest of us who have paid $7.50 to get insulted.  Needless to say, he did not break a leg hyping this particular little flick and it appears he is trying to hide.  <br />It is just so bad - the CGI fight scenes are pure boredom, the dialogue so bad it's good (I contradict myself there) and the conclusion so lame you wish once again that Godzilla had won and destroyed Gotham.  THis is a catastrophe that will somehow make a lot of people a lot of money - Go figure.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I give this album from Christina is really worth it! Her voice is very beautiful and she works so hard to sing, I'm glad she's such a great singer. Not to mention Britney Spears, she has a great voice too, but Christina Aguilera can really sing her heart out!<br />1.Stripped pt.1-This is pt.1 for Stripped. Its a good song, she tells that's &quot;the real her&quot;, and a lot of fools out there must have really got her frusterated. <br />2.Cant hold us down (ft.Lil Kim)-I love this song!Christina and Lil Kim can really sing, even when they're voices are working together. It talks about how men can be so foolish to women and telling to just let women be women. <br />3.Walk away-I can really relate to this song, its very emotional to me for some reason. I usually love listening to this song. So make sure to listen to this great song!<br />4.Fighter-OMG!I just LOVE listening to this song over and over. Has a rocking tune to it, and Christina's voice sounds really strong too!<br />5.Primor Amor-This song is in Spanish, she talks about how her first love started, kinda jazzy too. I like this song, its smooth and sweet. <br />6.Infatuation-A nice, latin beat, you'll love he vocie and lyrics in this song. And its really good! I love this song!<br />7.Loves Embrace-This is an interlude, theres a little bit of singing, but Christina sounds very soft in this song. But its still good, but I'm not CRAZY about it. But nice song.<br />8.Loving me 4 me-Yeah, I'll give Christina a chance on this song. I think she's done very well on this song, its very pretty sounded, for some reason it reminds me about Mariah Carey. You'll like this song, definetly!<br />9.Impossibe-This is a nice, jazzy song with Alicia Keys playing the piano in this. It was also produced by her, but Im not sure who it was written from. But its a nice, R&amp;B song, but when I first heard it I thought it was boring, no ifense Christina! But now I love this song! Great job!<br />10.Underappreciated-Eh, it an okay song, love song again. But its pretty.<br />11.Beautiful-I love this song. VERY BEAUTIFUL and it makes me happy, so I guess I am beautiful after all. right? Just kiddin, well you'll love this song and she tells you you're beautiful, she's beautiful, no matter what people do or say. <br />12.Make over-I think this is a cute song. Its fun, shes not saying makeover as if you get one, she's saying if people can just leave her alone and let her be herself. &quot;I dont want anyone trying to make me over&quot; is a line from the song that will make you understand what kind of &quot;make over&quot; she's talking about.<br />13.Cruz-This songs pretty, it has a beautiful ballad to it, sometimes I put on my ballet leotard and ballet slippers and dance to this song.<br />14.Soar-Yeah, I like this song. Her voice sounds so strong, I love it!<br />15.Get mine, get yours-This is a steamy song, I love dancing to it, probably not so incredible for little girls, but little girls can like it to.<br />16.Dirrty-I love this song so much!I dance REALLY crazy to this one in my room!Its a great party song, make sure you listen to it because its so fun!<br />17.Stripped pt2- Yes, this is the rest of Stripped pt1 even though Stripped pt.2 should be the song right after p.1 so you know where you left off at. She tells to meet &quot;the real her&quot;, cause people say fake things about her that she doesn't even do.<br />18.The voice within-I love this song so much!!!!!!! It tells to just trust yourslef and whats in your heart. Nice message and beautiful ballad.<br />19.I'm OK-This song is kinda sad to me, its very emotional, it tells about Christina and her difficult times.<br />20.Keep on singing my song-GREAT SONG! Atleast &quot;Im OK&quot; wasn't the last song on the album because then it'll make me more sad. This song is very happy and fun, makes me cheer up from the &quot;Im OK&quot; song. Well, thats it!<br />This whole CD is totally cool! Christina's got a great voice! It just makes mewanna sing along with her!Please purchas this album? Its very good!
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna should stick to what she does best - dance style pop hits.  While I appreciate her longevity and her finger on the pulse of shock value, this album as a whole is way short of talent.  Kudos for &quot;american life&quot; and her desire to take on the bush administration's hopelessly wrong policies.  But the rest of the songs are lacking any punch or soul. She is just rambling on about Jesus Christ
B000089RVX|5.0|Although a bit suspicious at first due to the heavy airplay of the first two tracks (\\"Bring me to Life\\" and \\"Going Under\\") , it was when I heard \\"Immortal\\" that I took the decsion to get this cd as fast as possible. (Both previous tracks were gems and I have/had  always appreciated hearing them on radio and tv). This cd is a must, and is an oasis in this rap/hip hop/gansta rap overdominated world. The tracks are ingeniously crafted from Amy  and Moody and produced  into a super set of rock tracks. Don't compare this group to anything else on the market, they are a one of a kind and this feeling will surely sink in after hearing all the songs. <BR>One of the main reasons of bying this cd was the voice of Amy Lee which is the fresh new female voice that the music industry has been waiting for for a long long time.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|This is definitely the end of a great band, they should've retired a long time ago, the music in this cd is just opaque, james labrie's voice is ridiculous, jordan rudess should play in a circus, john petrucci is a great guitarist but simply stuck on the same style mike portnoy is the same as petrucci but 100 times worse and john myung is the only one worth a listen, really if you're new to dt buy the first 4 albums starting from when dream and day unite until a change of seasons, if you're a dt fan buy it you'll love it if you plan to evolve in life and look for quality don't even come close to it.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I got this album the day it came out anticipating the new sounds of DT.  I was not let down one bit by Train of Thought.  It continues where six degress left off but with a more in your face metal sound.  The lyrics are well written and Portnoy's drumming is still amazing.  If you are a true DT fan like am you should pick this album up, you won't be disappointed.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|This is, in my humble opinion, Tony Iommi at his best.  Close second is his work on &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;.  Absolutley CRUSHING guitar, and Tony Martin's vocals are spot on.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; and &quot;Valhalla&quot;, but there is not a bad song on this album.  Who cares if its not vintage Sabbath?  It is straight-ahead metal at its best.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I'll say it just like everyone else did: this is really heavy!  If you like Dream Theater for their titles like Hollow Years or Silent Man, this is definitely not for you.<br />However, if you like bands like Tool and Metallica, you'll dig.  For sure.  There are many aspects that make this album really rock.<br />First of all, the instrumental sections.  The solos are absolutely unbelievable!  Petrucci and Rudess (guitar and keyboards, respectively) get technically better with each album it seems, and the arrangements are awesome.  Portnoy rocks in the heavier element, on the level with any thrash drummer that comes to call.  And for once, you can actually hear Myung on bass - well.<br />LaBrie's voice hasn't changed for better or worse since their last album, but he has certainly diversified.  You'll hear a few segments of hip-hop influence, some very Tool-like vocal melody sections, and some singing akin to what we've heard on Images and Words.  He does most of his own harmonies on this album (thank god).<br />For those of us who are fans of Kevin Moore (original keyboardist) for his conceptual visions, there album is replete with samples along the plotlines of the lyrics, as well as with references to other Dream Theater material, both new and old (Glass Prison from Six Degrees, Change of Seasons, etc).  Although it takes the ear a few seconds (or minutes, or hours, depending on your musical taste) to get accustomed to the heavy sound, the composition is still there, and shines throughout.<br />You have to stay open-minded to hear this album.  If you heard the As I Am single on the radio, then you have to realize that, while other songs on the album sound similar, there's much more to Dream Theater than that.  If you're a die-hard Dream Theater fan, be prepared to be surprised.  Of course, Dream Theater has a surprise in their repertoire for everyone, of any musical influence, somewhere in some song!  This is a good album, you should check it out.
B00005JKC3|3.0|Blah blah blah....Everyone is getting all analitical over a comic book turned movie. If you were not a fan of the Hulk from the comic books you may not like the movie, it's not that great. But if you were a fan of the comic book and you take the movie as a comic book, you shouldn't be dissapointed. One thing though....the bridge scene in San Francisco....in the first shot it is all foggy and gray, then all of a sudden in the next scene it's a clear day...oops.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is music that commands you to listen, to the haunting, angelic voice and beyond to the lyrics.  Sarah's life experiences of the last few years have impacted her music -- she has matured.  No, it doesn't sound like Fumbling or even Surfacing.  She is coming to us from a different place now.  You can hear it unmistakably in Answer.  Listen.........
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater have done it again.  They have literally outdone themselves in heavyness and virtousity.  This album is the METAL they've always wanted to do.  An instant classic.
B000002LLC|5.0|This is a great album! This proves that Madonna actually is a real vocalist.  The funny thing is, no one bothered to mention that the majority of all this music is written by Stephen Sondheim.  Of course, the reviewing disco divas probably will or do not care!  Two thumbs up!
B00005JMFR|4.0|This movie once again directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski (Matrix 1 & 2) takes an more interesting twist then the secons film did. Where the second film did get alittle preachy - this one is more action orientated.<br />Extremely interesting visual effects, as always, and a plot that seems to twist and turn. For those who haven't seen the first two, it might be a little confusing. For those who did see the first two - you might really enjoy this more.<br />The action is intense with an incredible visual sequence of the Sentenals who are the machine that are trying to kills human. The finale is very open ended and leaves itself for your personal interpretation. The final fight sequence between Neo and Agent Smith - played by the very talented Hugo Weaving (Peaches, Lord of the Rings 1, 2 & 3, Babe:Pig In the City) - is incredible and visually amazing in detail and imagination. Hugo performance of the stoic and robotic reading of the computer program that went AWOL - is funny, mysterious and scary - all at the same time.<br />Overall the film is good and entertaining. Again - if you are not familiar with the first two - it might not be as entertaining. But if you like the first two...you should like this one. Give it a shot.........\\"M-R.

B0000C7PQK|3.0|Like many of the reviewers here I, too, own all five Enigma cds and think that producer/multi-instrumentalist Michael Cretu has never lost his talent for creating solid ambient music. However, it would be nice for him to incorporate a variety of sounds, rhythms and meters because &quot;Voyageuer&quot; and the other four cds by Enigma sound very similiar. Cretu keeps reinventing the peanut butter sandwich (it tastes good, but so does turkey, chicken and pastrami). As with each Enigma cd, there is half an album's worth of solid material. &quot;Voyageur's&quot; most successful tracks are &quot;From East To West&quot;, &quot;Voyageur&quot;, &quot;Incognito&quot;, &quot;Boum-Boum&quot;, &quot;Total Eclipse Of The Moon&quot; (a nod to Pink Floyd perhaps?), &quot;Look Of Today&quot; (which completely sounds like ABC's 1982 hit &quot;The Look Of Love&quot;) and &quot;Following The Sun&quot;. The rest of the tracks are truly forgettable and album filler. &quot;Voyageur&quot; is definitely an improvement over 2000's &quot;The Screen Behind The Mirror&quot; and 1996's &quot;Le Roi Est Mort--Vive Le Roi!&quot; I just think Cretu is capable of more and he's spent 13 years attempting to give us a great cd, but they end up just being good and reliable.
B0000CFW87|5.0|How can someone say Josh Groban sounds like nails on a chalkboard? There's intelligence at it's finest folks, someone who will listen to a CD repeatedly 25/26 times and then says that they don't like it. Wouldn't you listen to it only once??? <br />Anyway, Josh Groban has one of the best voices in the entertainment industry today. I would put him in the category of great singers like Celine Dion and Andrea Boccelli.<br />This CD is awesome, for lack of a better term, and no one can be able to sit there and give it a bad review. His voice gives you chills, his range combined with his voice is phenominal, and he's an all around great singer.<br />Lastly, if you wanted to listen to nails on a chalkboard, you would put in the CDs of Barbara Streisand and Cyndi Lauper, not Josh Groban.
B000001EUR|4.0|In the eighties, The Scorpions would undergo a transformation not unlike another classic metal band, Judas Priest. Priest had shed many trappings of their more epic 70's sound in favor of more streamlined songwriting and a (somewhat) more commercial sheen. The Scorpions did the same, and by 1984 this transformation had been complete. Uli Jon Roth was nothing but a distant memory, and the most well known line up of The Scorpions had found their place. Love at First Sting still remains a great album, maybe not up to par with their 70's material but strong just the same. It has a very sleek sound that would later be copied by lesser bands who sought to capture the sleekness and commercial potential in this type of production. However, the songs still count, and they still rock, probably more than their previous album, Blackout. It begins with the rocker Bad Boys Running Wild, then to the anthem (the overplayed infamous) Rock You Like a Hurricane, and then to the more speedy songs Coming Home and Same Thrill. No Scorpions album would be complete without some experimentation, and this is in the epic anti cold war track, Crossfire. The ballad Still Loving You is their strongest ballad since the seventies, and the other songs have their own strengths as well. Too bad they hired outside songwriters and so on to try to duplicate the magic later. They couldn't. The Scorpions are the original &quot;pop metal&quot; band, but I mean that in a good way. Their songs are catchy and concise (even in the Roth era though maybe not on Lonesome Crow which I do love btw) and have a keen sense of melody and the bite that they possess keeps the songs from being &quot;pop&quot; in a bad way. Like a Heavy Metal Beatles (early) in a way. Get this, you should already have it!

0385504209|3.0|OK - I too heard a lot of good things about this book, and it does well at two things.  (1) The story hooks you quickly within the first couple of pages, and (2) The mesh of religious &amp; artistic symbolism and &quot;what it all means&quot; is intriguing, even if somewhat off historically (so I've heard).<br />My biggest problem with this book is that the ending negates the whole plot.  Let's just say that that whole thriller part of the plot revolves around the frantic effort to maintain information (or a secret) before it's &quot;lost to the world&quot;.  But when you get to the story's end, you find out that there were others all along who were guarding the secret/aware of the situation, so really, our protaganist's efforts throughout the whole book were not required, not necessary, and didn't really change anything.<br />So what's the point?
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I'm sure it didn't help that the premiere episode of Firefly was preempted, at least on the west coast (by a baseball game, if I recall correctly).  Those of us who set our VCR's to record it missed it.  That said, I did try to watch the subsequent episodes, but I just couldn't get into it.  By about the third installment, I realized that every single character in the show could be killed off, and I wouldn't care.  So much for Firefly.  Please try again with something else, Joss.
0743424425|3.0|This was one of the first Stephen King books I read, and I didn't understand why people found it so horrifying. Sure, there were some scary parts, but personally, I found Pet Semetary to be FAR scarier. Pet Semetary is one damn scary book. The Shining was an interesting, bizarre story, but I just didn't find it all that scary.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Amazing! From start to finish it is a nonstop rush of melody, aggression, and tecnical virtuosity! Once again Dream Theater has proven to be on top of their game with this magneficent work of art that just continues to demonstrate that Dream Theater is the best at what they do. For those of you who have never had the great experience that is Dream Theater, I strongly recommend that<br />you click the buy icon at the top of the page and buy this album.

B000002J03|5.0|When I had first heard of Led Zeppelin, the only song I truly knew from this album was Whole Lotta Love. One thing I learned later about the band as I gradually became a bigger fan was that you cant judge them by owning a greatest hits album or better yet from making one in the first place. Led Zeppelin II offers a more rock n roll side of Zeppelin which isnt displayed nearly as much in their first album Led Zeppelin I. <br />\\"Whole Lotta Love\\", carries a more hypnotic tone and definitely stands out, while other songs like \\"Bring It On Home\\", and double header song \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Livin Lovin Maid\\" which I couldn't help but jump up and air guitar to, exemplify their heavier rock side. But Zeppelin doesnt just sit on one genre on a whole album. They continued to play the blues rock they started out with on their first album in songs like \\"Lemon Song\\" and \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\". You cant discredit \\"Thank You\\" which kind of sits by itself as a more quiet song and is a great example of the bands originalty.<br />I think that this album was also the album that really shows off each band members talents. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" carries one of lead guitarist Jimmy Pages signature solos, but we cant forget \\"Heartbreaker's\\" intense solo which seems to hit millions of notes in a space of 15 seconds and which I personally think is one of Pages best guitar playing moments on an album(not considering his live stuff of course). Vocalist Robert Plant also delivers in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" screaming ''LOOOOOOooooove'' the theme to the dirty rock song. He also repeats his singing along with Jimmys twisting riffs in \\"Lemon Song\\" as he did on the first album in the song \\"You Shook Me\\". Drummer John Bonham also gets his chance in instrumental \\"Moby Dick\\" in which he seems to completely destroy his set. And we cannot forget the often overlooked bassist John Paul Jones jams an upbeat sound in the song \\"Ramble On\\" which is one of my favorite songs on the album. <br />While their talent shown here isnt nearly quite comparable to their live performances, they still gave it as much as they could possibly do for playing in a studio. This album really helped them to become powerful icons in the music industry. This album deserves no less than five stars. I recommend you bring it on home.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Liked the title? Then you'll love this new album from Dream Theater. DT's latest release, &quot;Train of Thought&quot; is by far the heaviest Dream Theater album of all time. When I say heavy, I don't just mean musically, I mean emotionally, spiritually, and artistically. It's amazing that a band as aged and well defined as Dream Theater can still keep it real after all these years. <br />I keep reading reviews of this album being reminscent of older Metallica. Dream Theater and Metallica don't even belong in the same sentence unless Metallica is opening up for them on tour. DT is on a whole different level, above of course. As to be expected from Dream Theater, the music is written and played out beautifully as well as flawlessly. Petrucci still has his infamous jaw dropping solos and riffs in all of the songs, and the drumming just absolutely blows me away. Whether you like heavy or not, you can't miss with this album, it's a must have for any Dream Theater fan.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|As I Am is Metallica, OK, but it's DREAM THEATER playing Metallica as they would never play it themselves, get my point? LaBrie's vocals are really strong in that one: &quot;for those who understaaaaand, take me as I aaaaam!!!&quot; Awesome.<br />This Dying Soul is a twisted sick sequel to the colossus Glass Prison. There are even some eastern sounding guitar riffs in the vein of Opeth's Bleak or DT's Home. There's also an obvious reference to Metallica's Blackened. Lyrically brilliant, heavy as ever, and its ending is the sickest (most technical) DT ending I've ever seen. Lightspeed playing WITH soul and virtuosity.<br />Endless Sacrifice has a very unusual chorus, this is the point where the &quot;nu metal&quot; influence gets evident... Well, that is FAR from nu-metal, for it's DT playing. Furthermore, it's inserted in a whole context, it's not nu-metal by nu-metal. Later on there's an incredible instrumental section, again full of virtuosity and intrincate playing by all bandmembers. One of my favorites.<br />Honor Thy Father is my least favorite. Here the heavyness really gets meaningless... There are some cool Maiden references (on and on and on and on and oooooooon), the polemical rap section (which I find very amusing BTW) and a cool Megadethish section (don't cross the crooked steps!).<br />Vacant is a BEAUTIFUL interlude with piano, cello and emotional vocals and lyrics. This piece is VITAL for the album's integrity, because it's our only breathing point. Very very very beautiful.<br />Stream of Consciousness is a long instrumental, very reminiscent of Metallica's Orion. It's composed of multiple individual melodies (very groovy and Liquid Tensionish) that merge one into another. Not so epic as Dance of Eternity, Erotomania or Metropolis interlude... Well I prefer virtuosity over grooviness and easy playing so I'm biased.<br />In the Name of God is divine. Definitely the central piece of the album, easily the most melodic (maybe the only one that can be called MELODIC). The chorus is VERY Maidenish, thus brilliant (Listen as the prophet speaks to me/ Killing in the name of God!). One of my favorite moments of the album is the instrumental interlude at 8:36. It's a fast guitar solo backed up by a loud bass funky solo, which feels very dancy. The album ends in a classic DT fashion, an epic fade-out.<br />Train of Thought is clearly an EVOLUTION for Dream Theater. People who are upset with its heavyness were expecting more of the same. I&amp;W, Awake and Scenes were all brilliant, but there couldn't be a replay of those albums. The tendency with metal bands is to evolve softening their sound, and that is usually a bomb for most fans (Metallica, Theatre of Tragedy, Paradise Lost, Anathema, Katatonia, Celestial Season, etc). DT is such a versatile band that it walks in multiple directions with their music. If this one is heavy, the next may be introspective in the vein of 6 Degress or even soft as Falling Into Infinity (just watch the musical diversity of members' sideprojects for a taste of their broad influences and capacities).
B0000CEB62|5.0|I speak for all DM fans around the world when i say this, the band could put out a blank DVD with just their pictures on it and we would still buy it. When a opportunity like this arrives you jump on it. DVD's like this one will not be in print forever, so thats reason enough for me!! Long Live David, Martin and Fletch.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was a superb film both in they way it was shot and the tribute it paid to the men who fought and died to end the naked aggression of the Nazis.  I believe that those men deserve to be remembered and should be honored for their sacrifice.  I suppose then that I am evil for believing this, according to Ian Cooper anyway.  I would have loved to have a private conversation on such with him, but since there was no way to do so I put my rebuttal to his comments here.  I would love to live in his world, where looking at the cause of the war and saying that should have been stopped gives you a moral superiority.  Something should have been done to stop the rise of the Nazis in the 20s, but what would he suggest.  Since the Nazi party was elected into power in Germany, what would have been a possible solution other than a preemptive strike to prevent the mounting problem that wasnt an obvious aggression until the mid 1930s?  And yes, those who then defended themselves when that aggression was unleashed are truly evil.  I mean, what right does any man have to prevent his life from being taken by another.  I suppose we would have all been better off to sit back and watch, hoping that it didnt come after us next.  Childish is believing that the world is black and white.  Killing is evil, so anyone who would kill for whatever reason is evil.  Thats great, as long as everybody refrained from being evil, but since asking someone to do so doesnt always work we must sometimes resort to fighting to stop it.  Man, would I love there to never be another war, because it is the most horrible thing in this world.  Tell me though Ian Cooper, what does it being the AD age have to do with an end to war.  War has been a constant for the span of human civilization, and only 20 years before the world had its first world war.  What is it about the late 1930s that makes you believe that there should have been some huge philosophical awakening and a pacifist resolve in the world?  Stop being a child.  The war wasnt provoked, it wasnt asked for by the millions who died trying to end it.  There are only to ways to end aggression; to fight it, or to curl up in a ball and hope they stop kicking you.  The latter rarely ends with you standing up and walking away.  Your solution is that we hope it doesnt happen and then hope for restraint on the part of the aggressor if it does.  Good luck with that.

B0000CAQ26|4.0|Pick this up, everyone. That said I will now say I don't like it as much as her previous disc. She has completely moved away from a trendy pop sound and built a rock wall of sound that I can only compare to Tina Turner's comeback. But this isn't a comeback at all, for Pink it's a reinvention and that's what will keep her ahead of her peers, and even though Madonna has given the nod towards britney , christina, etc. She should have given it to Pink because this girl will be around for A WHILE.

0789723107|4.0|I sincerely enjoyed reading this book on my train rides to work. Falling asleep while reading it was not really related to the book itself ;-)<br />Despite the many useful tips in the book (sometimes very obvious, but you need to hear them from someone to believe it), I think the design of the book (color print on almost every page) probably makes it too expensive and the actual content could probably have been compressed into 15 pages or so as well.<br />Anyways, a good read for most so-called &quot;web-designers&quot;.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is first class songwriter and performer-- none of those things are in dispute. So I guess an album like this comes down to song selection... and that, I suppose is what most of the criticism this album is likely to get will center around (and we can ignore idiotic ramblings like those in the review titled `the E$$ential Bruce Sringsteen' found somewhere on this page...). 1995s `Greatest   Hits' collection was great but did have some glaringly obvious omissions.  The collection in question is certainly an improvement-- if only because every album is represented, including the criminally underrated `Ghost of Tom Joad' whose brilliant title track appears here. Having said that, there are still some dissappointing omissions. The most obvious would have to be the selection of `For You' over `It's Hard to Be A Saint In The City'-- Bruce's most dazzling lyrical piece to date and the song that drew many a comparison to the legendary Bob Dylan. I also would like to have seen `Racing In The Streets', `Adam Raised A Cain' and `Youngstown', though these last three might not be missed by many out there. I think `Adam...' showcases the angry mood present on `Darkness' better than any other song on the album...<br />One other thing I have noticed is the omission of `I'm On Fire' on both this collection and `Greatest Hits'. Surely there is no one out there that would actually choose `Glory Days' or `Dancing In The Dark' over this one? Is this song omitted simply to force people to continue buying `Born In The USA'?<br />Regardless, one of the strengths of this collection is that it is a `best of' rather than a `hits' package. This means we don't miss out out on masterpieces like `Jungleland' that could never appear on a `Greatest Hits' package. Having said that, the inclusion of some other `masterpieces' such as `Brothers Under the Bridge' might have been good, though might have reduced the commercial appeal.<br />...and speaking of `Greatest Hits', why not include `Blood Brothers' on this collection? <br />Anyway, personal preferences aside, this is a much stronger offering than `Greatest Hits' with enough of the lesser known material (from `Greetings...' for example) to satisfy most, but not so much as to dissuade those people that bought only `Born In The USA' and `The River' all those years ago...<br />Awesome stuff. And some of the bonus tracks aren't bad either (`Trapped' is great and `Lift Me Up' is absolutely stunning).<br />Essential stuff indeed.
B0000CDL3W|2.0|I just finished watching \\"Terminator 3\\" and I think they should have just ended the series with \\"Terminator 2.\\"<br />As I see it, there were two main things wrong with the movie. The first was the fact that most of it seemed like one continuous car chase. Not that the first two movies didn't have their share of them, but in this case it didn't add anything to the story (or lack thereof). The second problem had to do with ending. I won't give it away, but it was thoroughly depressing and I suspect was most of what kept people away in droves when this movie was in the theater.<br />There were a few funny parts here and there, mostly spoofing scenes from the other two movies. Unfortunately, they weren't enough to save this film.<br />I recall hearing that the producers of the movie had to fork over around $10 million for Arnold Schwarzenegger. They definitely got ripped off.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|What America has needed for a long time now is a true female Rockstar.  Well America, we have one now.  This CD Rocks in a big way. As a huge fan of Linda Perry, and if anyone can tell me where I can get a copy of \\"After Hours\\" I would be grateful, \\"Waiting for Love\\" is my favorite track today. \\"Last to know\\" is awesome, but so are all the tracks here.  \\"Trouble\\" is way cool, I love the video as well. \\"Oh My God\\", well it kicks A$$ too. Pink, you have a new true fan now! My hat's off to YOU.

B00000ILDE|5.0|This 9 DVD box set will feature Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 (yuck) and Alien Resurrection (yuck) with two discs for special and theatrical edition releases of each film. Aliens Special Edition will always be the greatest version of Aliens, and one of the greatest sci-fi films I've ever seen. BUT, that won't stop me from trying to buy The Alien Quadrilogy.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|If I could rate 2 areas of this movie I would give the special effects a solid 5 stars! The storyline itself would be 4 stars. The graphics and animation surpasses Toy Story by far and to be honest, has probably set a new standard by which animated movies will be compared. The storyline is one which will hold a child's attention. It has a little bit of everything... humor (the sharks), adventure (the journey), excitment (Nemo's escape) and friendly encounters (the turtles). Adults will find this movie cute but probably won't find themselves watching it over and over again unless children are present. I enjoyed the movie and I equally enjoyed the quality family enterainment and the laughter that it produced from my children.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Okay. After reading the reviews before me..I have to say one thing.  WTH!  This is his job!  This is how he makes money.  Of course he released this for the money.  Now look past that...because every album you buy is for the money...and you get an excellent collection.  Definetely a major improvement on the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.  My only gripe is...Where's 'Backstreets' or 'Because the Night', or 'Night' or Candy's Room'.  But oh well...the bonus CD makes up for that.  Songs to look for include &quot;Code of Silence&quot;, the song that premiered during the E Street reunion tour of 99-00, &quot;Trapped&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Walking.&quot;  While this is for the person who wants a taste of Springsteen or Die-Hard fans only...it still delivers.

It was beginning to remind me more and more of the Dune novels as the story progressed.  The battle of a messiah with a foreseen destiny, and all that.  Of course, since Keanu's dialogue is limited to \\"Whoa!\\", you don't really know about the struggle he's going through.  The \\"modern Lucas\\" comparisons are apt, there is no character development in this film.<br />The programs are human and the humans are programs.  O.k.  The happy ending that everyone is bugged by makes sense, but Revolutions and Reloaded could have been one movie.  Cut out all that keymaster, and Mervinginwhatever, and last exile, and train-master stuff; then it may have been a fairly streamlined story.<br />So, aside from a smooth story, clever writing, and decent acting, what was the movie missing?  Tension in the main characters.  I was nervous for Zion during that battle; but Zion is a city, not a person.  I really didn't care if \\"The Kid\\", Link, Bazooka Jane, or even Morpheous/Trinity/Neo lived.  The only characters I cared the slightest about were the programs.  Smith, Oracle, and \\"The Last Exile\\".  As in the last one before the matrix program crashes and the robots decide to reboot the system.  Sentient programs?  That one still gets to me a bit.  Why The Machines would want sentient programs?  Programs that love?  Hmmm, that's stretching it a bit, in my opinion.<br />Philosophically, \\"Existenz\\", \\"Dark City\\", and even \\"Children of Dune\\" got to the point much better than the last two Matrix films.  The mixture of 18th-19th century European epistemology with ancient Eastern Hindu/Buddhist mythology and mild Christian mythological overtones were exciting in the first film, mildly intriguing in the second, and virtually gone in the third.  If you want sci-fi philosophy rent \\"Dark City\\" or \\"Solaris\\", if you want action go see \\"Kill Bill\\" or the \\"Alien\\" re-release again.
B0000A02TZ|2.0|They call this a re-mastered soundtrack ?!?! <BR>It's very hard to find what reason UNIVERSAL found in re-releasing this film on DVD. The video quality is the same as in the last edition and the same pretty much goes also for the audio. All that this proves is how easy it is to make a buck by giving a new edition a colorful name.<BR>UNIVERSAL has let customers down with their &quot;improved&quot; versions of this (classic) movie as well as SCARFACE but they can be sure we will remmember their record when their future releases come out! And regarding their forced commercials, they can rest assured some of us will simply refuse to buy whatever they advertise in this manner just by principle !
B0000AUHOH|2.0|i had hoped the audio commentary,deleted scenes etc would make up for what the film itself lacked.they did'nt.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I bought this DVD without having seen the movie before and I am more than glad that I did. The film may not be historically accurate but then, I never saw a &quot;based on a true story&quot; legend anywhere on it. <BR>U-571 is not only a very good movie but maybe even a better DVD. The soundtrack rocked my sound system like no other film since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<BR>Jonathan Mostow has proved to be an excelent director. His BREAKDOWN was an unexpected surprise; U-571 and TERMINATOR 3 have made me expect his next release with great anticipation.
1577311523|5.0|By reading The Power of Now, you will realize that all the worries in life are simply created by the mind, and by releasing yourself from it's constant judgement towards others and yourself, the path to true enlightenment is revealed. Reading this book will not only make you understand why most of us struggle in life, but will also help you break free from these struggles. A definite must for those looking to find a motivator in life!
B00008PW2E|5.0|I've decided to go on a hunger strike until this comes out on DVD.  If I starve to death, I will come back to haunt whoever is responsible for making us all wait.  (Or maybe I'll get a guest spot in season four...)
B0000844IT|5.0|Yes my name is really Ash but my last name isn't Williams.  But Army of Darkness is a superlative example of a good sequel.  It is hilarious and cool.  Though problem is the chainsaw just wasn't seen enough or used.  And another problem is that it was made by Universal and wasn't an independent film like the other two.  But all in all the movie is good, Bruce Campbell rocks and couldn't be more at the top of his game.  Though the Apocalypse ending absolutely sucks the S-Mart ending is the best
0066214122|2.0|Although Crichton does have some talent in building suspense<BR>(I couldn't put down Jurasic Park) this book is not worth <BR>wasting your time on.  The most irritating aspect I found<BR>was the character development.  He spends a lot of time on<BR>elaborating on their domestic lives and then jumps into this<BR>contrived high tech environment and just bounces around.  Since<BR>this book is allegedly about technology, I'd expect some more<BR>emphasis on the characters day to day working lives in order to<BR>get some better understanding of the situation they find themselves<BR>in.  But no, we get seemingly endless supermarket scenes where<BR>the merits of Pampers versus Huggies are debated.  You've <BR>got to be kidding?

I<BR>work in the field and I can tell you he doesn't have a clue what<BR>he's talking about.   That's fine, this is fiction after all, but<BR>then he could use a little more imagination in his descriptions<BR>of this invented technology of his and make it a bit more tantalizing.   <BR>These passages are either tedious for tech-savy<BR>folks or boring and opaque for lay people.

0140277447|5.0|This is an important book.  The incredible brutalities committed by the Japanese in Nanking are well known to educated historians and to the Chinese people.  The Japanese committed genocide wherever they attacked throughout Asia.  The number of Chinese civilians killed by the Japanese invaders throughout China is much, much higher than the numbers killed in Nanking.  <br />What is truly amazing is that in the year 2003, many Japanese people still are denying these events took place.  They rush to write negative, uninformed reviews and denials on Amazon and they team together to hit the 'NO' buttons to review other peoples' legitimate reviews.  Nanking was only one location out of many locations where the Japanese invaders brutalized and murdered en masse the local populations that they occupied.  Please read other books that cover the Japanese's horrible treatment of American and Fillipino prisoners of war. No other country ever killed so many of its POWs.  Not even Nazi Germany! <br />Those of you who continue to refuse to accept responsibilty for Japan's horrific actions in the 20th century bring shame upon yourselves and upon your ancestors.  The Japanese apologists should stand shoulder to shoulder with Neo-Nazis and skinheads who similarly insist that no Jews were killed by Hitler and the Nazis.  You are saying the same thing.  You have been brainwashed by Japan's leadership which very dishonestly refuses to accept their responsibility for Japan's crimes.  Anyone who would deny Japanese attrocities before and during World War II is a disgrace to the human race. Try as they might, these apologists for Japan's murderous past will never be able to silence the truth.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|The man himself succinctly explained the song selection in the liner notes with his &quot;one man's coffee is another man's tea&quot; analogy and it certainly fits. Bruce states further down in the notes (which are quite good, btw, but should include more photos &amp; insightful snippets to the songs on discs 1 &amp; 2 as well, not just 3)that many of the songs were chosen to expose the newer faces in the audience to a wider range of his music. Mission beautifully accomplished. <br />The newly remastered tracks from his first two albums sound remarkable and fresh--something I didn't expect from songs that are now 30 years old. A longtime fan can rediscover the fun &amp; beauty behind songs like 'Blinded By The Light', 'For You', and 'Sandy' while newbies may be surprised to find out the heavy jazz, folk, &amp; R&amp;B influences in Bruce's earlier music. <br />What the first 2 discs do best is follow the arc of many of Bruce's characters. The youthful boardwalk life of the teenagers in his first 2 albums give away to the hungry &amp; passionate souls of 'Born to Run' to the broken, disillusioned &amp; lost but still fighting characters in 'Darkness on the Edge of Town', 'The River', and 'Nebraska'. 'Born in the U.S.A.' is represented sparingly (it sold 15 million copies--why take up on these discs w/ songs millions already have?) before giving way to some of Bruce's strongest songwriting with adult stories about love (Brilliant Disguise, Tunnel of Love), re-finding one's faith (Living Proof), redemption in the face of despair (Streets of Philadelphia, Ghost of Tom Joad), and coping with loss (tracks from The Rising). Ending the 2nd disc with 'American Skin' and 'Land of Hope and Dreams' is a brilliant touch: in 2 songs Bruce warns us of the danger of living in a society governed by fear, and then issues a call for all of us to climb on board the train that will take us to a place where we all fit in &amp; can share a collective happiness.<br />Disc 3 has a good (longtime fans will again cry out for personal favorites) selection of rarities &amp; really showcases some of the outstanding work Bruce has done for films. 'Missing', 'Lift Me Up', and 'Dead Man Walking' show just how powerful &amp; musically adventurous Bruce can be while still working within the parameters of someone else's art. 'Held Up Without a Gun' and 'The Big Payback' were both originally written during the 'Nebraska' sessions and are fun &amp; poignant respectively. 'County Fair' has an almost &quot;Last Picture Show&quot; quality about it as Bruce describes the final days of autumn spent at a travelling carnival--longtimers might catch the connection to 'Wild Billy's Circus Story' from his 2nd album and wonder if the young kid in the earlier song did take up the circus boss' offer &amp; joined &quot;the big top.&quot;<br />I can't penalize Bruce for fact that some of my personal favorites aren't on here ('It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City', 'New York City Serenade', 'Backstreets', 'Racing In The Street', 'Point Blank', 'Mansion On The Hill', 'One Step Up', 'My Beautiful Reward', 'Dry Lightning', etc, etc, etc) nor are some of the rarities/unreleased gems I'm dying to have in official form ('Cindy', 'The Iceman', 'The Way', 'Frankie', 'Losin' Kind', etc, etc, etc). The quality of the songs represented here is simply too strong to ignore. The collection is a cohesive thread of songs that hardcore fans can thoroughly enjoy while newbies can hopefully discover the keys to whichever albums by Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band they don't have &amp; decide to look deeper into their entire, remarkable body of work.
079284131X|3.0|3 stars and a half is a fair rating for this hokey horror film. It's lack of explaination for the demonic doll's motives and existence raise questions, but getting into all that might have placed lag times on the fun factor. That's what this film wants to be and it is.. FUN. I mean there is some mumbo jumbo in the beginning about how Chucky comes about but it's silliness. The fun and horror begin when Chucky attacks right before he's threatened by the young boy's mother who is trying to convince eveyone that her son is not crazy. Well they soon find out he's not. It starts off, mom doesn't believe 6 year old son, then detective doesn't believe mom, followed by no one believes anything until they see it. \\"Child's Play\\" spawned numorous clones and sequels but this one is the best.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|The indefatigable metal warriors are back. And this time with a solid release and to think that they are reachingh 50 makes my jaw drop. While there are lot of reviewers here who wrote about the bands history and lineup changes, I will directly jump into the music.<br />Wildest dreams is a solid rocker begining with heavy guitars, its a typical Maiden song, with nice optimistic lyrics and good singalong sections. Probably one of the best Maiden opening tracks in recent times. I love the intro to the 2nd song Rainmaker, excellent guitars but the song slowly becomes average. No More Lies is a accoustic driven sweet song, as usual with beautuful, introspective guitars, its also long about 8 minutes, just like the epic title track. No More Lies is my favorite in the album. Amazing lead guitars in this age of bastardized metal, the old gurus shows the younger generation what metal is about. I wish the younger people listening to metal nowadays dont learn their guitars from Linkin Park or POD (no offence) but look up to these giants. Montsegur is an offbeat track and is good. The tittle track is a epic story and is quite awe inspiring. Gates of 2marrow and the rest of the songs are ok, the standouts are Face in the sand, Age of innocence & Paschendale. Special mention should be made of JOURNEYMAN!!! a 5/5 track.<br />Nevermind the ugly cover artwork, this album has some glorious moments. Obvioulsy regular Maiden fans are going to devour it, but it should also appeal to the new crowd, if you are not into Maiden, this is definately a good start, remember you have a treasure to collect, if this is your 1st Maiden album. The CD has no dearth of guitar talent, its overflowing guitars and I love it. Well, these guys are bringing glory to metal like always, incredible. This album is everything St.Anger is'nt. Enjoy!
B000000OEI|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums.  Crimson tide is not only a good film but a good soundtrack, on tracks 3 or 4-5 it has the navy hymn.  Track 5 was placed at the start when Gene Hackman called Roll Tide and Roll Tide also pops up again in the credits area (another good choice).  A very Good orchestral piece that helps bring tension in this submarine movie (which is also very good). The music also goes with the action genre.  Roll Tide Hans and encore
B000002J09|5.0|1.Black Dog - 9/10 great opener but still not one of my all time favourite tracks here. Anyways you'll still find yourself liking this thi song and listening to it alot.<br />2.Rock And Roll - 10/10 HELL YEA! My 2nd favourite song on the album, just a good, solid, fast, masterpiece that you can never get tired of.<br />3.The Battle Of Evermore - 9.5/10 really cool song with the mandolin, and I think the lyrics have something to do with Lord of the Rings?<br />4.Stairway To Heaven - 10/10 you just HAVE to give this song a perfect 10 no question. Enough said.<br />5.Misty Mountain Hop - 7.5/10 even though there are no bad songs on this album, this is my least favourite. The verse gets kind off boring for me.<br />6.Four Sticks - 9/10 cool drum beat, cool everything. Just another good song.<br />7.Going To California - 9/10 the most folkish song on the album, but the guitar is nicely played and the vocals hit me the most on this song.<br />8.When The Levee Breaks - 10/10 whoa, put aside Stairway To Heaven and listen to this. From the wicked drumming to the amazing vocals, this song is by far my favourite on the album, and by Led Zeppelin.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I used to complain abuot the trend of the 'complilation' (compiling hits and songs by popular artists) as the new way of creating movie soundtracks......I always felt it was a cop-out (versus writing a whole new score for a film....geez, unless the film IS a musical, those days are gone) until a few stellar ones proved me wrong. Love Actually one such gem - a feel-good (actually make that a feel-great movie) movie with a feel even better bunch of songs without one dud among them. Even the 'incidental' music (the music that is the connective tissue between songs and scenes) is something you would want to listen to without the movie, without lyrics - just because it is beautifully written in its own right. What you won't be able to get from the cd is the absolutely seamless fusion of the soundtrack to the visuals - for that, RUN, don't walk, to see Love Actually.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Dont be dumb and not buy this dvd if you love Led Zeppelin. Obviously, Led did not have a lot of spotlight on television in their days and of course today. This dvd is this source and only thing so Led Zeppelin out there. If you really want to witness the greatest rock band of all time, get this. Of course they are the best ever of the 70's. This 2 disc DvD set offers the explosive energy Led Zeppelin had. <BR>    They weren't your poppy type of band and didn't like the whole televsion media thing anyway their style was to make magic on stage and that is what makes a band great ;is their live preformances or actually whats makes this band great.  Their music was epical, magical, and inspirating. Their music always was great for gettin HIGH and jam to espcially if you went to their concerts. Led Zeppelin really had some king of magic on its own and everyone in that group had extrodinary talent. No band ever will be better than Led Zeppelin not even today.<BR>    I mean there is no greater footage of Led Zeppelin stuff anywhere so you might as well get this. And don't worry about the movie &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; its a waste of money, you can still apreciate it but this DvD gives you more and better preformances. There's nothing about the DvD that you wont regret<BR>you'll get your moneys worth. So buy it, you'll really dig it.
0316666343|5.0|This book, though sad and harsh topics, shows emotions and thoughts beautifully woven throughout.  Not at all hard to follow and I was captured by it.  I read it in just a few hours.  I completely recommend this book to people mature enough to handle the sexuality and who won't be bothered by some graphic crime scene-type things (not incredibly graphic, but if bodies being cut up and then a part being found randomly would make you sick, don't read).
B000001G16|5.0|Richie Sambora is tragically under-appreciated in the music industry.  If you don't believe me, listen to this album you'll wonder why he isn't a household name.  I bought it when it first came out and still listen to it.  His vocals are beyond compare.  I think his voice is his best instrument and that's saying alot since he is an amazing guitar player.  You cannot go wrong with this CD.
B000002513|5.0|I'm from Philly so I've been listening to Bruce for 30+ years.<BR>'Rosalita' was the first song of his I remember hearing on WMMR<BR>(probably 'Hungry' Ed Schiaky's show...). There's a part about halfway in where The Big Man hits a sax break. It caused the hair to stand up on the back of my neck. How do I remember that? 'Cause I got the same feeling listening to it this morning and everytime I've heard it since approx 1972.....<BR>Plain &amp; Simple. This album is what rock &amp; roll is all about.
B00004SCX6|4.0|The same as Baby One More Time, Britney just didn't want to loose the winning formula of her debut album, &quot;Ooops I Did It Again&quot; was produced by the same team -(minus) Eric Foster Producer, the Max Martin production was in charge of almost the entire album, delivering now POP classics like the leading single &quot;Oops...&quot; and the independent stament of &quot;Stronger&quot;(well her loneliness is killing her no more, Britney says), or the autobiography of &quot;Lucky&quot;, some of the songs are made in the same mold and failed to kept the attention of the listener all the way, some songs are so similar that you barely remember how to keep them appart.  One thing is true Britney's ballad area is really been damaged by &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;(the video saved the song just a lil'), but the song, the music, the lyrics, the voice, wow!, this song yuk!, no wonder it was the first single to not hit the 100 of the Billboard. A ballad that is well portrait here is &quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot;, you could find a great feeling and sentiment on this one.  Other Tracks worth your time are &quot;One Kiss From You&quot;, &quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot;.  <BR>This album of course is consider a POP classic and why it shouln't, after all Oops! she did it again!
B0000AMRJC|2.0|Cheesy, too long and not as bloody as everyone remembers, Scarface is way overrated. Some parts are laugh out loud dated, like the Frank Stallone musical montage and the rear projection car scenes. The first half of the movie as Tony comes to power works better then the latter drug soaked parts.<BR>The DVD is of high quality and still worth a watch.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|STAND-OUT TRACKS:<br />the &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; remix.  Over 10 minutes of a high-end-Vegas-show style number.  On its own and apart from the movie, one can almost picture an extravagant stage show to follow along with it.<br />&quot;Run Fay Fun&quot; by Isaac Hayes.  This disco/funk tune should be every bad-a**'s theme song when entering a room.<br />&quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity&quot; by Tomoyasu Hotei.  What's used as the theme song for the film trailers.<br />&quot;The Flower of Carnage&quot; by Meiko Kaji.  Probably only because this song's style evokes nostalgic memories for me, as my parents watched old Japanese TV programs in the '70s and the year-long samurai-era maxi-series that Tarantino even references in the making of &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (and from which actor Sonny Chiba gained fame).<br />UNNECESSARY GARBAGE:<br />I'll have to side with most other reviewers and state that &quot;Ode to Oren-Ishii&quot; is pretty worthless.  Hip-hop is one thing, but mushmouthed amateurish rhymes only serves to detract from the quirky nostalgic mood set by the rest of the album and by Tarantino's attraction to the kitschy.  If RZA was coherent and clever, I might have a different opinion.<br />ENHANCEMENTS:<br />The enhanced-CD features only include three film trailers in QuickTime format with a splashy switchboard interface.  Nothing spectacular.<br />OVERALL:<br />A fun CD for fans of Tarantino's off-the-beaten-path style and flair for nostalgia.
B000092ZYX|4.0|If you compare Radiohead to any other band of this era, You'll notice that Their music is quite the opposite from ordinary. Which is why I find myself so attatched to it.  The music is deep, taking you through an &quot;adventure&quot; of sometimes fast and sporadic beats, and at times slow melodramatic beats.  Just like Kid A, Hail to the Thief maintains its electronic computer generated sound, but also has it's rock side like in The Bends. My personal favorites from the cd are &quot;a punchup at a wedding&quot; and &quot;a wolf at the door&quot;, as they both tell you stories of struggles, and grief. If you are a TRUE Radiohead fan, you WILL love this cd.
B00003CWL6|5.0|One of the best movies of all time, in my opinion.  This movie shows two typical (dysfunctional) and average families each with their own troubles and triumphs.  The movie comes to a very well written climax with an interesting twist ending.  A must see if you haven't already.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Leave it to Pearl Jam to release an album of rarities and b-sides that put all their other albums (with the possible exception of 'Ten') to shame.<BR>The strength of this material is almost mind boggling. A classic.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I'm a huge Austen fan and take any chance to see movie adaptations of her novels. Persuasion is one of my all-time favorite novels. <BR><BR>  This adaptation is rather disappointing. I was hoping for as beautiful a film as I'd read in reviews. Instead I felt the action was too hurried toward the end, the beginning painfully slow and the characters too exaggerated. <br /> The novel was beautiful and subtle and made the reader ache for Anne. Instead, this movie makes you ache to watch. Ciarán Hinds is just too oafish (my opinion) to play the dashingly handsome Wentworth, Anne's father, Sir Walter, too much of a fop, when he really wasn't that bad, and Anne herself too plain and meek for her stronger novel-character. <br />  The movie wasn't wholly bad, though. The slow, autumnal feel was glorious. I enjoyed Lady Russell's character as well as the scenes when there are in Lyme.<BR>  The ending was just odd, including the final scene when Anne and Wentworth are standing in the middle of a street parade. Where did that come from??<BR>   One thing that really bugged me was the treatment of Wentworth's letter to Anne. How that letter made my heart flutter when I read it! And in the movie, it was unintelligible!!! Don't have two voice-overs crossing each other: Half of what is said is lost. Where was the editing on this scene? It should have been his voice alone, or Anne's voice beginning and his picking up, but not overlapping as they alternated.<BR>  I'm still waiting for a truer adaptation.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This CD is soooo  good.  After hearing As I Am, I thought this CD is going to be like FII, but heavier.  I couldn't be more wrong.  It's heavy, but it's very progressive.<br />Every Dream Theater CD sounds different than the one before it, but almost every one shows off how musically talented they are.  And if you think these songs are great on the CD, go see them live and truely see how good these guys really are.<br />Lauren
B0000CFW87|5.0|As expected, this CD does not disappoint. Josh Groban has the most incredible voice! Even though I do not speak spanish and cannot understand the spanish songs, Josh's voice sounds impeccable. I love the tone and sound of Josh's voice. It sends chills down my spine. I have Josh's first CD, the 2nd CD that was recorded live on PBS and now this CD. I love them all! I hope that Josh is around for a very long time as the music world needs people who can really sing unlike most of the junk that is on the radio these days. Buy this CD, you wont be disappointed. It is incredible!
B000003TAW|5.0|This Is not just Weezer's best album but it's very much one of the most enjoyable albums ever, along with Audioslave, Toxicity, and Smash. Weezer is a band who most of my peers consider over rated, but they'e not. Weezer is the king of of 90's alternative rock, but you won't know that unless you like that style of music and you've 3 previouly selected Weezer songs (Undone, Buddy Holly, and Across The Sea). Here a correct rating for all of the songs on the blue album.<br />My Name Is Jonas - a very good song to open this album and only this album with (9/10)<br />No One Else - good chorus, well liked, average weezer (9/10)<br />The World Has Turned And Left Me Here - it's a very good song it just dosen't lock on to me and get stuck in my head (8/10)<br />Buddy Holly - very good all around, good words, great guitar work (10/10)<br />Undone-The Sweater Song - there is something about this song that draws me in just cannot pinpiont it, though best song of the album (11/10)<br />Surf Wax America - just more average weezer not really into surfing (9/10)<br />Say It Ain't So - probably my least favorite of this album if Across The Sea (Pinkerton) would replace this song this album would rule ALL music still an excellent song (8/10)<br />In The Garage - excellent guitar solo, above average weezer second best of the album (10/10)<br />Holiday - average weezer weezer doesn't mess anyhting up but it could be better (8/10)<br />Only In Dreams - great bass intro, slow, 8 minutes, average weezer really like the pickup for the chorus and the words of the chorus (10/10)<br />Weezer is a great band and this is their best album, so get it.<br />Later
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is such a great movie.  Everyone of all ages will love it.  It is one of the best pixar movies.  Movie will teach a lesson to all.  No matter where you end up there is always someone looking out for you.  Whether it is a friend, a family member or someone you work with.  No matter how old you are you are never to old to be taught a lesson that will help you in lifes little advantures.  Nemo is a no stop laugh movie that will not give you a dull moment
B000089A07|1.0|This movie was fairly awful to watch. I suppose in a very run-of-the-mill sort of way it was all right, but really, I hate this film. All it really said to me was, &quot;Ed, man, I'm sorry, but it's over.&quot; With Fight Club, American History X, and Death to Smoochy, I really thought he had a promising career ahead of him, with consequential films, but why on earth did he agree to to this movie? It's basically Silence of the Lambs with Ed Norton instead of Jodie Foster. Oh wait! Accept that Silence of the Lambs was a lot better! This movie was so recycled and boring that I left feeling sorry for the people that had pretty good repertoire (Ralph Fiennes, Anthony Hopkins, and yes, Edward Norton) before this. <br />Yeah, I can't get away from the Ed Norton thing. Why, Ed? I think I should write him a letter and ask him. I guess the rise and fall of Edward Norton can't be totally blamed on Red Dragon. Other contributors: The Score, 25th Hour, and The Italian Job really dug him into the grave and buried him alive.
B00005JM02|5.0|Ellen DeGeneres as Dory is one of the most quotable characters from 2003- &quot;I love games. Pick me!,&quot; &quot;You can't fight evolution. I'm built for speed.&quot; &quot;Just keep swimming...&quot; &quot;I will call you squishy&quot; Although not for young kids, this movie is genius. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Don't even bring up &quot;I speak whale&quot;.<br />Also love Bubbles- &quot;Bubbles! I love the bubbles!&quot;<br />It's a fantasy. Yes fish don't really talk. DUH! and animation is not real either.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Before anything else, IGNORE THE CRITICS' REVIEWS.. its natural that Pink's surprising longevity and evolving sound will threaten the establishment..  <BR>I've been a Pink fan from the start, and been continually been impressed with her changing sound and evolving style. She is a true pop-icon in the making, and her harder edgier sound does not take away from her trademark catchy beats and introspective lyrics. <BR>This album provides a number of strong and memorable tracks with a sound that ranges from rock, dance and soft-pop.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh's debut self-titled CD blew me away, and I waited what seems forever for his second.  This set of recordings is more masterful and more beautiful than his first if that's possible.  Each track takes my breath away and moves me to a higher plane.<br />Music has always been intertwined with my emotions and I think this album covers them all!  As music sooths the savage beast in all of us, &quot;Closer&quot; has the ability to rise goose bumps on our souls and bring tears of joy for a voice that spans generations, for an artist who already should be listed as one of our great voices of all times....Just buy it...DO IT!
B000094PWG|5.0|Fabulous! The remastered version with the bonus tracks is fantastic, especially since it has the original version of her first hit, &quot;People Hold On.&quot; The additional three tracks firmly root this album as a shining star from the golden era of club music (late 80s, early 90s).
B0000CABBW|4.0|This year has been marvelous in the theatrical release of movies that aim to enrich and encourage young girls to bypass cultural boundaries that hold them back from the biological aspect that they were born female. In a similar fashion to BENDING IT LIKE BECKHAM, WHALE RIDER is a story of a young Maori girl living in New Zealand who desires to become the new tribal leader. But because Pai was born a girl her grandfather prohibits her from learning the cultural traditions. Pai is then forced to sit on the sidelines while other first-born boys are taught the ancient ways of their ancestors. Her stern and strict grandfather often reprimands her and she is determined to prove herself worthy of the post of the new chef.<br />Although there are obvious similarities between these two films, WHALE RIDER contains a more richly textured and nuanced plot. The most compelling part of the story is the anthropological plotline whereby a culture must face its own mortality in a modern world. When old customs and traditions have lost their meaning for every day life, why keep them going? The surprises in the script are not in how it will turn out, but in the matter-of-fact honestly of the characters. Interesting view of a different culture, and well acted. WHALE RIDER is a great viewing experience.
B0000CFW87|1.0|I loved Josh's first cd. I have eagerly awaited his second one for 2 years. But this new offering is so bad I am shocked!!!!!! It is monotonic, all the songs sound the same. The whole thing is bombastically overproduced!!! Sounds like he is singing to a Yanni concert. The arrangements are way tooooooo loud and the percussion is outrageously intrusive, making him virtually SCREAM every song. And what is with all these foreign language songs? They are neither interesting nor worth hearing twice. Josh has such a beautiful voice, but whoever produced this mess has done him a MAJOR disservice. If you loved the first cd, I cannot state strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!! I hope he changes arrangers, producers, and conductors and lets someone else help him pick the songs for the next cd. I can't give up hope that this beautiful voice will be used for a better effort.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|How can you not love Sarah?  She is gorgeous, and so is her voice.  Was this album worth the wait? Almost.  I would have liked to see some creative growth, but like the other alt-chanteuses like Loreena McKennitt and Enya, she seems comfortable continuing to create breathy, ethereal tunes.  And like them, she does it so well.  Melodically and lyrically, she has still to top Fumbling Toward Ecstasy, one of the great albums of the 90's.  But this album is growing on me with each listen.  &quot;Fallen&quot;, of course, is the high-profile song, but &quot;Stupid&quot;, &quot;Train Wreck&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; are also worthy of airplay.  All in all, another solid effort.
B000001E18|4.0|It makes sense that the older, idealistic \\"OG\\" fans would have a harder time swallowing this offering from U2...I personally consider it to be the album they SHOULD have made, considering that Europe was in shambles and the US Government barely batted an eye-lid. <br />Germany's Helmut Kohl passed off racist driven hate crimes reminiscent of the Third Reich as isolated incidents (for those of you who were at U2's Frankfurt or Munich shows in 1993--you'll know exactly what I'm talking about...Bono sang \\"Broken bottles under Turkish feet\\" during 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' in response to the Turkish family Gent who were bombed out of their home by German extremists). Sophia Mussolini (grand daughter of Benito Mussolini) continued the family legacy, picking up where her grandfather's fascist regime left off, the Scotts were once again being trampled upon by tories loyal to British tyranny, and words can't begin to describe the brutality and horror that occured in Bosnia on a daily basis. <br />These events are only a brief snapshot of the twisted reality that the European Community was living in. This reality was horrific, fractured, surreal, and so rediculous it had to be sensationalized and fictional...<br />Zooropa was born out of this chaos. It's a surreal, European pop-rock record that holds more in common with Achtung Baby and The Unforgettable Fire albums than any other U2 releases. The European imagery and atmospherics are there, the ache and frustration are there. Is that why we American fans have a harder time grasping Zooropa? I'll bet we have a better understanding and appreciation of Zooropa after 9/11...once the chaos and violence finally hit home. <br />Zooropa's a historical document...not only that, but this album GROOOOVES. As a drummer and musician, I think this is the album that Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. were waiting to make. Adam's playfully funky basslines reverberate throughout your entire body...shaking your ribcage, taking you back to the funk and psychadelic trips pioneered by Parliament, Chemical Brothers and dare I say Kraftwerk. Just listen to Adam play those phat lines in \\"Lemon,\\" \\"Some Days,\\" \\"Dirty Day,\\" \\"Babyface\\" and the gorgeous \\"Stay.\\" <br />Larry has his fun too, laying down some of the most interesting percussion and drum patterns ever put onto a U2 album. Although never the most technical of drummers, Larry still puts soul into his beats...particulary on the disco like trip/hop of \\"Lemon,\\" the  funky percussive onslaught of \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car,\\" the pop snare n' bass punch of \\"Babyface,\\" the savage thump of \\"Dirty Day,\\" and the soothing groove of \\"Stay.\\"<br />I LOVE this album. And I hope you love it or grow to love it as well.
034544678X|5.0|This dog-book is entertaining, endearing and helpful to every pet owner. I've read many dog-books and some are very dull. But this book keeps you amused while equipping you with modern dog training techniques and helps you understand dog-nature as well as human-nature. also, there are wonderful narrative stories - one of which made me teary-eyed.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|Okay, so I had to sell Donna's &quot;Endless Summer&quot; CD at $3.00 to finance the purchase of her new &quot;The Journey + The Very Best of Donna Summer&quot;.    <br />I saw her for the first time in concert on August 21, 2003 at Rama, Ontario.  She hyped her yet to be released CD.  And this is it?!  She never mentioned that it was going to be another mathematical permutation and combination of her anthology of songs with 3 new additions.<br />Donna's disco era of music are great tunes to boogie to at nightclubs, or while driving stop-and-go in rush hour traffic.  Her 1990's to present tracks aren't the same.  Donna's 1970's to 1980's walk of fame are exactly that.  <br />Let's keep it that way on her, hopefully, final &quot;Very Best of&quot; and her near-ultimate &quot;The Dance Collection&quot; CD's.
B0000648WZ|4.0|A good film will never take itself too seriously. A good film will remind you that you are watching a film, not a slice of reality. In most respects, this makes it all the more fun to watch. Troopers is the epitome of tongue-in-cheek.<BR>Troopers never, ever, ever takes itself seriously. And it does it well. It's funny because it's ridiculous, because it's so... gross. You feel for the characters because they're so blatantly two-dimensional. You care about them.<BR>I mean, come on. Massive bugs that want to destroy humanity? Hardly an original set-up for a film. Throw in some megabudget CGI, some rather weak actors, a shower scene and LOTS of fake blood, this could have been a huge flop. But because it was tongue-in-cheek all the way through, because it acknowledged its own absurdity, Troopers has become a cult classic. Even if nobody 'gets' the satirical undertones, it's a fun film that's fun to watch, with lots of nice gory action sequences.
B000009HF2|5.0|Having bought your &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot; vinyl album in 1976, it's taken 27 years for me to finally see you in concert on November 6, 2003 at Rama, Ontario.  <br />You and Bob Mayo have aged gracefully.  I especially miss John Siomos who was an innovative and solid drummer on your album.  <br />Your 20 minute rendition of &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot; at the concert was superb!  You are the master Talkboxer and guitarist.<br />Having sold the vinyl, I bought your remastered CD to replace your original CD a couple of years ago, and it's a faithful reproduction of the vinyl.  It's simply a keeper in my CD collection.<br />I'm sure Amazon.com would like to thank you for mentioning them at the concert.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Long time fans of masterpieces such as Metropolis Pt.2 and Images and Words will probably be disappointed in this latest release. This is a very heavy CD from an incredibly talented group. They're overuse of filtered and distorted vocals obscure their creativity and talent. I'm disappointed that they've gotten away from some of the wonderful melodies and harmonies that made them who they are. In a nutshell, their previous releases separated them all the talentless garbage so prevalent in today's rock. This effort does little to widen the gap. The rap-like vocals in 'Honor thy Father' make that cut almost impossible to listen to unless you're into rap.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Matrix Reload was a big disappointment for me that's why I believed that the final part(hopefully) of Matrix trilogy would be better.<br /> Luckily, I was right despite of bad reviews of the all-knowledge movie critics. The Matrix Revolutions don't copy so much first Matrix and don't use so much same old special effects.<br /> There are some good new characters for exemple Indian family andthe man who's saying that he is God. Mr. Smith shows that he is real, final enemy, who has a lot power and nasty face. Neo is going to be saviour and Trinity will help he so far as it possible. The people of Sion will fight brave and making many sacrifices to protect the last human race city. Robots are very cruel without feelings and the final battle is showed awesome well. Musics are chosen very well and specially the last battle between Neo and Mr.Smith offers great music. All in all, If you don't like Reload, you'll like Revolutions because it's better.
B00006879E|5.0|The music today is getting progressively worse as the only new songs coming out are remixes of old songs!! Rap and hip hop are taking over the culture!!  It is refreshing to hear such an original and incredible album!! I highly reccommend this to anyone!!
B0000CDL3W|5.0|I just watched T3, after waiting for so long. First my friend went behind my back and saw this movie in theatres without me, and then wouldnt see it with me after that. I REALLY wanted to first see this film in theatres, on the big screen with all the graphics and action. Renting it at home isn't quite the same. I knew about this movie for years, I knew Nick Stahl would play John Connor, and I was so dissapointed when I didnt get a chance to see it in theatres. Well anyways, I saw it. I rented it on DVD. You know something I noticed, is all the terminator movies have sad moments. No great victory lasts. The fact that Sarah Connor died of luekemia was dissapointing. She rocked in T2. But the action in t3 was awesome. Not like anything I've seen. It was total sci-fi action, and violence, and some humor. TX didnt ruin the movie like that guy said. She isnt suppose to express emotion, even if it's fake emotion. She smiled and she acted sexy. That's all that guys care about anyway, physical beauty. She was psycho, which made her character so powerful. All knew abilities such as her arm turning into a gun or torch, and being able to program anything. It wasnt a second version of t2. It had alot of knew advanced sci fi technology. I was completely entertained from beginning to end. It was sooo funny when that nutty doctor from the institution that held sarah in t2, saw arnold, and just bolted...running through the graveyard. Nick Stahl (great actor & good looking) played John Connor. He did a great peformance. As well as Arnold and Claire Danes, who I didnt know was even in this movie. I give this movie 5 stars, because it didnt ruin the trilogy. You know how a second or third one can ruin it if it sucks. Well they pulled it off. T1 T2 and T3 were all great.
B00003CXIP|5.0|It is a rare commodity in the film industry to come across a movie which depicts the process of growing up and the bonds that unite friends in such a heartbreakingly realistic fashion. &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, starring Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell, is just that and more, spiced with humor, suspense, and not to mention terrific performances by its remarkable cast. Set in the small Oregon town of Castle Rock, it tells the tale of four friends Gordie Lachance (Wheaton), Chris Chambers (Phoenix), Teddy DuChamp (Feldman), and Vern Tessio (O'Connell), and the adventures and experiences they share during the summer of 1959. After hearing of a teenager missing in the Oregon countryside, they go in search of his body, and the approval of their hometown and each other. Little to their knowledge, Castle Rock's token hoodlums, the Cobras, led by a ruthless Ace, are also out for the body, and will stop at nothing to take it from them. The unforgettable journey brings them closer together, and reveals a strength and sense of trust they never knew they posessed. <BR>Probably one of the most beautiful things about this movie is the chemistry all of the characters seem to have together on screen, as well as the individual talents each bring. Under the direction of Rob Reiner, each actor brings a different quality to their performances, and coaxes the traits of their characters with a natural ease. River Phoenix especially stands out. This being one of his earliest films, you can almost taste the raw and truly amazing ability and innocense he has within him, only adding to the sadness of his being taken from us too soon. Overall, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; is one of my personal favorites, and not to mention one of the classic first coming-of-age movies. And it has still, after all these years, set a high standard for films to come.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is my favorite DT CD.  I have waited for the day when DT would make an CD full of songs with non-stop chops.  This CD fits the style of metal music I prefer to a &quot;T&quot;.  There are many forms of metal music out there and to me this is the perfect fusion of Progressive, Power, Classic and Nu-Metals.  I was blown away the first time I listened to the CD and I continue to discover more and more with each listen.  I for one am glad to hear the bass more upfront and the keys in the back of the mix. It works well, especially with the style of this disc.  By the way if you listen to the CD more than once you will notice that Rudess is very much present and is playing like a mad man throughout.<br />There are many bands who try and fail to cross boundaries and define new territories.  But, as I see it, Dream Theater has done this three times:  1) Combining 80's &quot;AOR&quot; with &quot;Real Metal&quot; on Images and Words, When Dream and Day Unite and Awake.  This combination built the foundation for the genre known today as Progressive Metal. 2) Fusing &quot;Progressive Rock&quot; with &quot;Real Metal&quot; and &quot;Progressive Metal&quot; creating the three most important concept CDs ever written in &quot;Metropolis Prt. II, Scences From A Memory&quot;, &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; and disc 2 of &quot;6DOIT&quot;.  And Finally with &quot;Train of Thought&quot; they have done it again by combining &quot;Progressive Metal&quot;, today's &quot;Power Metal&quot;, &quot;Classic Metal&quot; and &quot;Nu-Metal&quot; (by the way this progress was started on &quot;6DOIT&quot; with the songs, &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; and &quot;The Great Debate&quot;.<br />I also think the lyrics are perfect.  No, it is not a story this time.  The lyrics are introspective, angry and real.  I for one think they are very thought provoking.<br />Hats off to the best band in the world.  They have created a new genre of metal once again, &quot;Nu-Prog-Power Metal&quot;.  A disc that will go down as a metal classic.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a must see movie. It is suspensful and thrilling. The graphics are so good and realistic. Follow Merlin's adventures as he searches for his lost son Nemo. The bonus features are great and I highly recommend ths DVD to people of all ages.
B0000028RR|5.0|I understand the message Rage liked to preach completely contradicted what allowed them to get the message across to begin with. Without capitalism, this band doesn't reach the people it does and they never make it. That's fine with me, they are completely entitled to their opinion and I suppose in theory communism makes sense. <br />That, however is not something I want to go into. What draws me to this band is Rage Against The Machine is pure funkmetal. Tim Bob on the bass (aside from Chris Cornell) is what seperates this from the Audioslave act we see now. Tom Morello being the guitar wizard we all love; he's as talented as anyone out there. Maybe you don't agree with some of the politics here, that shouldn't affect your opinion on the music here. They deliver their music in a powerful, thought provoking manner. I can't help but love it.<br />Finally, I just want to add that there is nothing sophomoric about repetition in lyrics. If anything that makes the lyrics more powerful. Emphasis is key when you're sending a message and that's what Rage has always done. Message taken, although I can't say I agree with everything. Stictly from a musical standpoint this is top notch work. You're missing out if you can't open up to that fact.
B000003TA4|5.0|I'm not what you would call a Nirvana fan, but this is a great album. Its been overhyped over the years, and it is not the essential album that some make it out to be, but it is something nearly every rock fan will enjoy a lot.<br />PS, some of these recent one-star ratings are really transparent. A little shameful.
0767812646|5.0|As far as I'm concerned Oliver rates as one of the top musicals ever produced.  Mark Lester as Oliver and Ron Moody as Fagin as well as all the other characters are appropriately cast in this wonderful movie.  The songs in this musical are memorable and will always stay with me.  To me, for a movie to receive a grade of &quot;A&quot; it must be able to withstand repeated viewings.  This is one movie I can look over a number of times and truly enjoy it.
0385504209|5.0|This is my time reading a novel by Dan Brown and I couldn't help but be amazed by the work.  It brings into question the essential question of &quot;what do you believe in?&quot; which not many books accomplished to the degree Dan Brown has.<br />Intrigue, Conspiracy, and Adventure are the core of this book, and if you like any of these themes get this book.  It reads easily and at times the suspense just kills you, you don't want to put it down... Hope this helps
6305003882|3.0|Don't take my middle of the road three star rating as a sign of apathy. This movie is one you will either love or hate, and in my case I very much enjoyed certain things and very strongly disliked others.<br />Obivously the big draw in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say, he does an outstanding job with this role. In the true story of drugged-out high schooler Jim Carroll, he thrives on the type of script Academy Awards are made out of: tons of opportunities for him to be high, low, enraged, in sorrow. There are a lot of opportunities to use his physicality in the role, and he seizes every one. In particular I think of his drug withdrawal sequence and he and his friends' mourning the death of a close friend by getting drunk and playing basketball in the rain.<br />The plot has a sixteen year old Jim Carroll playing high school basketball. Three of his teammates are his best friends, and when not on the basketball court, they tend to find all kinds of &quot;innocent&quot; trouble around New York (knocking over food vendor carts, for instance). Another outlet of energy for Jim alone is his diary where he records sensations he feels in his young life.<br />His search for sensation and his friends' desire to find trouble coalesces in experiments with drugs like cocaine and herione. As Jim notes in the monologue of the movie, there is no such thing as a part-time addict. They fall further and further into the downward spiral in an effort to evade pressures from school teachers, coaches, and parents.<br />Some of the scenes in this movie are very gripping and visceral. However, the links between these scenes tend to be bogged down in poor directing. I realize this movie was a lower budgeted one, but there really is no excuse for having a movie made in 1995 that looks like it was made in 1985. While the performance by DiCaprio is extraordinary, the directing is lackluster. Poor camera angles, helpless lighting, bit part actors who look and sound amateur; those should all be blamed on the director.<br />However, this movie is worthwhile if you are one who has a particular interest in either Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg (he stars as a main character and one of Jim Carroll's best friends), or the subject matter. I have to say I thought &quot;Trainspotting&quot; handled the subject of drug use extremely well, but this movie is right up there in the ability to depict the sensations felt by those addicted.
0451197968|4.0|This is an interesting short novel set in the not too distant future.  Richards is unemployed, poor and has a dieing daughter who he cannot afford drugs for.  The only solution for someone in his predicament is to go on television and participate in a game show.  Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and that type of thing are not the rating blockbusters in this era.  People with weak a heart run on a treadmill which increases in speed whenever they get a question wrong.  If they survive to the end they win money.  This is just one example of what to tune into in the future.<br />Richards is not the most pleasant of men and is not too nice to his interviewers, doctors and everyone along the way.  There is a special game show for people like him.  In it he can potentially make one million new dollars if he wins.  If however like all contestants before him he does not win, then he will die.  He must outrun and avoid hunters intent on killing him for a number of days.  The public can win money by ringing the station and turning in his whereabouts so there is nowhere to run.  He can kill those after him but no civilians.  He also must constantly mail in tapes of himself talking to the camera every day so even though he is told the postal marks are not shown to the hunters he knows this is untrue and must keep on the move.<br />I saw the movie of this book when I was a little kid so saw no point in reading it until now.  Surprisingly, well I guess it shouldn't really be a surprise, the book really is nothing like the Schwarzenegger action movie.  It is a pretty good read and a must for fans of action thrillers.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|You'll enjoy &quot;The Italian Job&quot; if you take it for what it is: a summertime caper movie.  It will entertain you for an hour and a half, but there's really nothing you'll take with you.<br />All the actors are fairly unique and fun to look at.  Mark Wahlburg is the brains of the bunch, but he's sensitive too.  Jason Statham stands out as &quot;Handsome Rob&quot; who is a wheelman as well as a ladies man.  Charlize Theron holds a subdued beauty and confidence in this film.<br />However the characters are not larger than life like the characters in Snatch or Oceans Eleven, but they also don't try to be authentic like characters in The Score or Spy Game.  This middle ground approach leaves the characters a little bland and forgettable.<br />The plot is fair, though it is a little predictable.  There are heists and double-crosses.  Much of it is a setup for the stunts, which are pulled off well and don't show any major flaws.  The Mini Coopers are fun to watch.<br />However, the plot is also a setup for heavy product placement, including the Mini Coopers, several Napster references, and a prominent Pepsi truck used in one of the stunts.<br />I liked that this film did not rely heavily on profanity or violence.  None of the protagonists used weapons, and I cannot recall any of them swearing.  The biggest laugh of the film for me was when a 400 pound gangster called another character a &quot;mother freaker.&quot;  It has a PG-13 rating because Edward Norton whacks a couple guys with guns.<br />I recommend this movie if you're looking to kill 90 minutes, but don't expect a lot of brain work or redeeming value.<br />Pros:<BR>-simple, straightforward, fun caper movie<BR>-no profanity<BR>-the heroes use no weapons (besides a fist)<BR>-directing is clean; no major flaws<br />Cons:<BR>-cliched and predictable<BR>-heavy product placement<BR>-won't leave you with any redeeming value beyond pure entertainment

The whole album, I bought the Internet edition as well as the regular edition, was UNREAL!!!  Josh is truly a phenomenally talented guy!!!  And the DVD of the Internet edtion showed him as being a really funny guy...it's so cool!<br />And Josh even played the piano!!!!  THAT was breathtaking as well!!!  You will NOT regret buying Closer!!!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" was my welcome into anime, and a good one at that. Japanese animation is sometimes hard to follow and often confusing but this is very easy to understand. The creative works of Hayao Miyazaki previously include classics such as \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\", \\"Castle In The Sky\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\", but \\"Spirited Away\\" is his latest and most acclaimed to date, winning countless awards and deservedly so. There's always been a certain magic to his movies and this is no exception.<br />As a family becomes lost while looking for their new home, they stumble upon a train station that leads them to an old, abandoned theme park. The young girl Chihiro has an eerie feel about the place so she's reluctant to explore and begs to go back, but as her Mom and Dad become enticed with the smell of delicious food cooking from a distance, they ignore her pleas and venture further into the shops, leaving poor, frightened Chihiro with no choice but to follow.<br />Her parents eventually come across plates stacked of tasty eateries and indulge themselves in it. As they try to persuade Chihiro to join them, she briskly shakes her head and, frustrated, wanders off on her own. It's then when she notices a bath house and comes to meet a mysterious boy named Haku who warns her to get out of there. As he pushes her away, darkness descends and the place no longer seems abandoned as the lights flicker on and the night comes alive with black ghosts (or spirits). As she runs back to her parents, what she finds instead are her Mom and Dad transformed into pigs. Confused and scared, she races back to the entrance only to realize that it's covered with deep waters now as a boat arrives with masked figures cloaked in drapes. As she tries to convince herself that this is all just a dream as she struggles to wake up, Haku (an oddly familiar soul) returns to her side, giving her substance so she doesn't fade and become invisible. In time she learns to trust him and he promises to assist in getting her parents back so she can leave this place and return home. But first she must blend in and demand work from the boilerman, whom happens to have legs and arms like a spider, to escape the greed that could trap her in this strange world forever. Through a series of events she eventually becomes suspicious of Haku's motives but has no other options in saving her parents. Along the way she makes new friends, becomes a stronger person, and faces challenges that help unearth the courage from within herself.<br />\\"Spirited Away\\" has everything you'd expect from a fantasy movie, such as a dragon that reminds me of \\"A Neverending Story\\" and a witch named Yubaba (with a very big head and an even bigger baby, mind you), but the imagination and storytelling are truly original and you never know what's going to happen next. It's a real joy to watch and the dreamy animation is beautifully realized as it's brought to life.st in getting her parents back so she can leave this place and return home.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Gen X'er here &amp; I haven't heard anything that's gotten me this turned on for a long time. Highly Recommended, probably the best album since Radiohead's OK Computer.<br />If you're an indie snob that's insisting on comparing it to another &quot;better band,&quot; you should probably forget it, because if you can't just listen &amp; enjoy, then you've already ruined the trip.<br />Sometimes loud, sometimes moody, sometimes ambiant, just altogether great. Light up &amp; enjoy...
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Amazing.  Granted, I was already biased as a huge Pearl Jam fan before the release of this album, but once I finally got to hear it, it was more than I possibly could have hoped for.  I had only previously heard about ten of the songs off this set, so I was pleasantly surprised by the new (old) songs I'd never had the chance to hear.  One of the coolest things about this album is that it spans Pearl Jam's 12-year career, and some of the songs are from the classic &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Vs.&quot; era...very cool!  Not every rare song of b-side can be on here, however, and as a result, there is nothing from the &quot;Singles&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Merkinball&quot; EP, and various popular covers are absent, such as Crazy Mary and Sonic Reducer.  But given the excellent quality of this album, that is insignificant.  The booklet that comes with the album notes which original album session each song belongs to, and has a note from one or two band members about each song.  In the liner notes for &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;, Mike McCready says, &quot;I still don't know what it's about, and I don't want to. I love it.&quot;<br />There are too many amazing songs on this album to note most of them, but I'll point out a few tracks that stand out, such as  Other Side, Sad, Alone, and Down, to name a few.  Alone is one of those circa 1991 songs that makes you wonder why it didn't make the cut.  &quot;Ten&quot; B-sides Wash, Footsteps, and Dirty Frank are all present, along with the original version of Yellow Ledbetter previously only available on the &quot;Jeremy&quot; single.   The majority of the second disc has a rather melancholy feel, and it is great to spin in the CD player while you relax and soak it all in.<br />I think the most ironic thing about this album is that Pearl Jam's secondhand songs that couldn't make it to the original albums are better than almost anything so called &quot;rock&quot; bands put out today.  You will thank yourself when you listen to &quot;Lost Dogs.&quot;  Take my word for it!
B0000E1WNV|5.0|Seeing that fairwell concert was tear-pulling I couldent keep my eyes open at the thought that the boss was going to stop doing this. If this DVD captures the power of springsteen than it's priceless.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nothing anybody can say about nas's current status can take away from the absolute genious and superiority of this record.  Not only is it nas's best, but I would contest that it is the best hip hop record ever.  Cop it, you own't be disappointed, because after 8 years of owning it, can still put it in my stereo and give it a listen every night, and not get bored.  Even if you dont' listen to hip hop, get this al.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album, simply put, is not for every one. Some may find Yorke's voice annoying and whiny-I find it original and interesting. Some may find their lyrics odd-I find them intelligent and unique. Some may find their music slow-I find it methodic and pleasant. OK Computer is not an album that one can easily grasp (or like) at first. I myself was displeased when I first heard it, but it has quickly grown to be one of my favorite albums of all time. Open your mind, listen a few times, give it a chance, and then make your judgements. Who knows. You might end up liking it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|My simple words cannot give justice to the impact this album has left on me. 'CLOSER' is truely a harmony of love, melancholy, and inspiration that leaves you feeling every note sung. <br />The musical accompanyments are stellar and well executed as usual, thanks to a few musical guests and production collaboration with David Foster (again). <br />This album gives the listener a &quot;closer&quot; experience with Josh Groban's multitude of talents, as he has written a few songs and performs on the piano as well. <br />&quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; is an especially moving track (personal opinion)<br />Don't take my word for it--LISTEN TO 'CLOSER' YOURSELVES!!!!!!!<br />PS--Josh is on tour starting January; Canadian cities are: London, Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa<br />PPS--Nov 15 Josh will be at Sherway Gardens to promote 'Closer'
B00008PW2D|5.0|Most of you are moaning about the number of episodes in the season and the price, which I can understand, but I think you all are smoking crack when you say that this is the low point of the series!<br />This season, despite being only a few episodes, was FAR SUPERIOR to 4 and a lot of 3.  Especially 4, which was not GOOD.  It was drama and bad writing--not Sex and the City worthy stuff.  Season 5 was all about the GIRLS...which is what this show has always been about.  I was literally euphoric after watching some of these episodes in the 5th season.<br />Anyhow--I'd like to reserve judgement until I actually watch the DVD's, but for now I will give it 5 stars, based upon the quality of the episodes themselves.
B000002B1M|5.0|This CD is AWESOME. Nas's rap style is like no other. I do have to say something though, I heard all the hype about illmatic and then I bought it. Please forgive for saying this, but I thought Illmatic was kind of crappy.IT was written is awesome though.   God Bless.
B0000CFW87|5.0|There is something to be said for an artist that essentially defines a musical category. Sure, the title of &quot;Pop Opera&quot; has been around for a while, with the Three Tenors and Andrea Bocelli representing this class of music well. Josh brings a youth to this normally staid genre much the same way Tiger Woods does to golf, with experience well beyond their years. Josh is a phenomenal talent that sings with great emotion on a wide variety of incredible pieces.<br />Among my favorites:<br />- You Raise Me Up: Easily could be played on any top 40 station. This is the kind of song that could have been done by Bette Middler (a la &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;), but is bolder in its arrangement with several &quot;take your breath away&quot; moments, whereas the former just seems to ooze.<br />- Mi Mancherai: Anyone who can listen to this should be able to know what the song is about without having to know the words. Joshua Bell's violin blends so well with Josh's vocals that you feel the sense lost love and the emotional emptiness of the narrator in this flat out gorgeous song.<br />- When You Say You Love Me: Josh takes you to a place several times in this song that you just don't see coming. Again, could be a great radio tune.<br />- Oceano: I must look like a complete goober to everyone who sees me driving while this song is on, as I conduct my own personal orchestra and sing along to a language I know nothing about. One of the more up-tempo songs on the album.<br />- Remember When it Rained: Lots of friends comment to me that they have a lot more respect for musicians that can write and perform their songs, rather than just sing. This song shows that Josh really is a consummate musician. He co-wrote the song, and plays piano... quite well I might add.<br />While I've only mentioned my favorites here, quite honestly, all the songs are good in that they span an emotional spectrum in an hour. No, it's not everybody's cup of tea, but neither is golf. Josh's gift to us is that he transcends beyond his genre's normal audience. Do not miss this recording!
B00008H2LB|1.0|I find it simply disguisting that anyone could consider this ill-composed, annoying abomination of a cd worth any sort of praise musically. This band is so inept of talent it makes me sick. For someone to actually compare this rap/pop whatever sort of waste you consider it, to a great composer is an abomination. Simply put, a very overrated band that does not have enough talent or creativity to fill a thimble. If you have any respect for music, letalone self respect, you will never consider buying this cd. If I could give this a negative rating, it would certainly be in the deepest negative one could ever imagine.
B00005JMFR|5.0|With the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, the Wachowski Brothers have found Spirituality: Redemption, Catharsis, Family bonding and most of all Love.<br />This is the most personal film of the trilogy and for that it will probably get slammed by those who feel that The Matrix should only be about balletic fights, blowing up machines or buildings or killing people.  But there has always been a strong undercurrent of Spirituality in all of the Matrix films: it's just that here, it is in the forefront. The battle scenes act as a respite from the scenes of Love and bonding between the cast members: Sati and the Oracle, Sati and her father and mother, Neo and Trinity, Morpheus and Niobe to name a few.<br />One of the nice things about all of the Matrix films is that the Wachowski's have made sure to populate their movies with all races. Their future world embraces all people and in particular Women as Warriors. Niobe, Trinity and Zee all have an agenda and do not hesitate to physically act upon it and in this Matrix this means they save their men from death and Zion from destruction.<br />\\"Matrix Revolutions\\" is a beautiful film, filled with glorious images, do not hate it because it wears its heart on its sleeve: Love is All We Need, after all.
B0000CDL93|1.0|I understand that when DVDs first came out we wantedd to get all of our favorites ASAP - Right Stuff, JFK, Total Recall, etc. I name these three because they were all released and then re-released with new stuff. The new stuff was cool, and it came much later than when the DVD was originally released. However, this is the third JFK DVD to be released already. How many more should we expect. What makes this one anymore special than the Director's Cut. I appreciate trying to get as much stuff on the DVD as you can, but why could it not have been done on the second one. These DVDs are becoming like computers, as soon as you buy on you better beware because a new, sleeker model will soon be on the way.<BR>It boggles my mind!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There's few singers out there whose voice is so intense and intimidating that it becomes irresistible. Iggy Pop, P.J. Harvey, Beth Gibbons from Portishead, Nick Cave to name some. Of course, this asset alone does not a good album make as the most devored music junkies know.<BR>    But coming around to this album here, there are cases when the combination &quot;unique voice-great songs&quot; comes through and thats's whan you wind up holding &quot;The man comes around&quot; in your hands.<BR>  <BR>    It's no wonder that this album is loved by so many people that do not normally go for country music or Johnny Cash for that matter. I fall exactly in that category too. But this is simply too special.<BR>     To begin with, i'm not entirely sure i would classify this as a country album even though i wouldnt really know as what else to classify it. <BR>     An album sung by country music's icon which mostly contains covers from groups spanning such diverse genres such as Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Sting or N.Cave? An &quot;experiment&quot; such as that could've been one that could have gone horribly wrong. Especially in other hands.<BR>     But this is Johnny Cash we're talking about, a man very uncharacteristic of his genre and a man gifted with a voice impossible to forget once you hear it (whether you appreciate it or not).<BR>     As i heard through the album, i found it increasingly difficult not to be sunk in deep awe. By the time I came to Cash's interpretation of &quot;Bridge over troubled water&quot; i thought i wont make it through the whole LP without crying. The stunning, deeply dark cover of that song had been already preceeded by gems such as &quot;Hurt&quot; or &quot;The man comes around&quot;. <br />    But on i went listening, and it only got more compelling.<BR>    &quot;I hung my head&quot; has got to be once of the most beautifully narrated stories i've heard in song format. &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; must have reintroduced this truly great song to 1000s of unknowing listeners with the added element of Cash's ultra-unique delivery for those who know the original version.<BR>   &quot;I'm so lonesome i could cry&quot; is a definition in persuasion as you second the feeling by listening to it even you happen to be the happiest person in the world.<br />    Now, more experienced listeners know, that with cover versions, you attempt one, tops two, in your album. An album mostly compiled of covers is more often than not a disaster. Johnny Cash (predictably) makes such theories sound otherwordly. They might concern others. But not him.<BR>   I dont have more than 2-3 country albums in my collection with this one included. But, if you truly love music, and you're looking for that magic only music can provide i dont see how you can let such an album elude you. <BR>    Chillingly beautiful, at its mildest melancholic and at its strongest extremely dark this is an absolute classic.<BR>     One of the undeniably time-defying Lps of all time.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I was all against the whole fad, the Strokes-Vines-Hives-White Stripes-etc. although I liked some of their songs.  When I started to listen to this album, I wanted to hear how bad it was and what a fluke their first album was, and say it was too bad that the son of Elite's founder couldn't hack it no more.  However, after a couple of listens (well, after a lot of listens now) I can say this is a pretty good album.  Almost all of the songs have good melody and short strange lyrics.  I love their guitar sound, especially on tracks 3, 4, and 9.  That's as far as my review goes, I won't get into any further music trivia puzzling metaphors, other than to say it's good - at least listen to it.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I'm sure that Andrew W.K. made this cd with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor and that he wanted to do nothing more than make a big, dumb, crazy and loud cd. And it comes off as fun. This cd is about fun, and having a good time plain and simple. It's big, it's dumb, it's loud, and nothing more. No complex lyrics on politics or world issues or depressing relationships. This guy just wants to party and have fun. What's wrong with that?  Andrew W.K.s vocals are raspy and perfect for this cd. His voice is wrapped around a giant wall of overblown sound. Makes me think of soccer stadiums and big concert arenas with the crowd pumping their fists and singing along to rock anthems. This guy gives out more energy at his concerts than most guys in rock music today.  Anyone who hates this cd needs to relax and open their minds a bit more, and maybe not take the cd so seriously. Like i said, the cd is big, it's dumb, it's loud, and above all else, it's pure fun. Nothing more! By the way, that cover photo of his face all bloodied up is real. He actually did smash himself in the nose with a brick just before the photo was taken. What some people won't do for art!!His second cd is even better and even more fun and sounds a lot like Meatloaf the way the keyboards are played. Defintely get both cds.
B000002LOE|5.0|I loev this Cd!! I borrowed this from a friend, for like about 2 years, back in the early 90's after I got into REM with Auto for the People, and gee I just couldn't stop playing it!! I love all the songs!! Well, eventually I had to give the CVd back!!! But we still are friends!!!!! *lol* Last year I bought my own copy of this CD. I listen to it whenever I feel a bit down. I think this is a really really good CD, and daresay I say it, a great one from a great band. With each passing year I realise how precious REM are. I hope they keep making music for a long time. Come back to Australia guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ps. and I like &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; whats so bad about it?? its a nice happy song and good on the guys for taking a chance and celebrating life!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008MLSH|1.0|Unlike Bartoli's or Hei-kyung Hong's new CDs, this CD was a big<BR>disappointment to me.<BR>I guess I just relied on the reviews by Grammophon Magazine and<BR>Amazon.com's review. Usually, I do listen the music before I buy.<BR>For this CD, I had no choice since there are no listening booth<BR>at the record store.<BR>Anyhow, I hates her mushy voice(kind of worst feature from Sutherland's voice). Her voice doesn't have anything special except annoying sound.<BR>Surely, she is very very beautiful. Perhaps, she will survive on stage because of the stage presence or volumm of her voice.<BR>However, I have a big doubt that she will be successful in recording field.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Actually this is only Judas Priest cd I have, but i´m plannig to buy at least British Steel and Painkiller.<br />Screaming for Vengeance is a great record due mostly to the amazing guitars and of course the blistering voice of Rob Halford.<BR>Even if you don´t like too much the high pitched voice of Brian Johnson(AC/DC), I  bet you´ll like this voice because it has many variatoins and even when he sing hi-pitched it doesn´t get annoying.<br />Now to the songs:<br />The Hellion/Electric Eye: I think that this is one of the best metal songs ever. It has incredible guitars and excellent vocals.<BR>Don´t you think he sounds a bit like ozzy when he says: &quot;You think you've private lives Think nothing of the kind&quot;?<br />Riding On The Wind: It doesn´t sound too good at first listening but I bet it will grow on you.<br />Bloodstone: This is quite good. Especially this part: &quot;How much longer will it take<BR>For the world to see<BR>We should learn to live<BR>And simply let it be&quot; And another tnihg: in the first verses he sounds a lttle bit like Axl Rose.<br />(Take These) Chains: One of the best! This mid-ballad is completely amazing. I like especially this part:<BR>&quot;I don't owe you anything<BR>Why don't you get out of my life<BR>Through it all the memories cling<BR>And I can't sleep at night&quot;<br />Pain And Pleasure: Many people dislike it but i don´t think this is a filler at all. It is a great slow-burner.<BR>&quot;you bring me PAIN but you give me pleausure&quot;<BR>I lke especially when he says &quot;Don't know what I like&quot;<br />Screaming For Vengeance: Awesome! it´s very fast and catchy.<BR>I bet you´ll sing it in the shower, I know I do, i even imitate his powerful scream. Try to sing the chorus:<BR>&quot;We are screaming for vengeance<BR>The world is a manacled place!<BR>Screaming, screaming for vengeance<BR>The world is defiled in disgrace&quot;<br />You've Got Another Thing Comin': Although it was the single it´s not the best. It´s good, simply not great. I like the begginig and this bit:<BR>&quot;Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had<BR>You think I'll let it go you're mad&quot;<br />Fever: when i saw the title i thought it was a song by Boney M(they do have one called like that)or something, but actually it´s quite envolving.<br />Devil's Child: Could been better, but good. I like especially this bit:<BR>&quot;You took my heart<BR>And left it blown to smithereens<BR>I gave my body as a slave<BR>You cut my flesh<BR>And drank my blood that poured in streams<BR>I'm left here broken and ashamed&quot;<br />The Remasters Bonus Tracks:<BR>Prisoner Of Your Eyes: Excellent! Amazing ! One of the best. Great and long solo(like I like it),great vocals and guitars. This song has everything.<BR>&quot;Love is blind<BR>And love deceives you<BR>You came along and captured me<BR>Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes<BR>Trapped in time<BR>I cannot leave you<BR>I'm just a prisoner of your eyes&quot;<br />Devil's Child (live): I said it all up there except that this could have been a live version of Screaming for Vengeance or (Take These) Chains.<BR>Nevertheless, it´s a good live offering.<br />For what I know Judas Priest are a really great band and you know what?<br />THE PRIEST IS BACK!<BR>I can´t wait for the new cd...
B0000CAQ27|5.0|There are 2 words that can accurately sum up this piece of work..<BR>F@#*ing brilliant!!!!! Every song is different.  Every song is energetic.  The collaboration with Tim Armstrong has proven to be a wonderful blend.  The true Pink is reveled and it completely shines through on every track.  <BR>I wish I had the time to write more but I'm too busy rocking out to this CD for the 12th time today.
B000088E6D|5.0|I love this album. Every note, every song. <BR>It has inspired me to learn more about music because I find that I'm uplifted after listening to it. <BR>Thank you Michael, wish you all the best from Calgary
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I totally agree with Racquella because Play is the 4 most amazing girls who ever step foot on this universe. If you're getting it, make sure to listen to 'It's a Hard Knock Life' because if you've never heard of PLAY, then <BR>1. You're crazy<BR>2. You're missing out a TON!<br />So get it and be obsessed with Play like me! They deserve it!
B000002UAX|5.0|I've heard praise heaped on many bands, none of them can stand in a room with any of the Beatles. I don't understand how such an unbelievable force, a formative energy for the evolution of culture, could have existed in any way that touched my own lifetime. How can a single band, just four guys playing ordinary instruments, create music with such brilliance that it will never find a rival? The only answer to any question about the Beatles is that they were THE BEATLES. Every Beatles album is the best at what it does. Rubber Soul is the most sublimely perfect record to come out of the early rock renaissance, and Revolver has become the best and most beautiful representation of its evolution. Sgt. Pepper began a revolution that has not ended, a revolution that will never end so long as anyone recalls even a faint echo of its genius. If you ever want to be in a band, do anything, or go anywhere in rock, though, you need the White Album. Any band that did anything interesting from 1968 on could because of the white album. It's everything, it's the ultimate rock and roll band making the ultimate rock and roll statement. This album is artistic posturing, it is oppulent indulgence, it is self absorbed, but in a way that makes you believe they wrote the whole damn thing just for you. It IS the legend, it's the litmus test for whether someone is cool enough to actually be a Beatles guy. Pete Townshend had his gaudy &quot;rock operas&quot;, Led Zeppelin trashed their hotel rooms and wore tight jeans, the Beatles proved that Rock and Roll that was sometimes less polished and gritty could carry genius and not just testosterone. Nothing about the white album is mindless, and yet it is so COMPLETELY rock and roll. The White Album is it, this is the invention of the Rock and Roll persona. The album showcases John Lennon in some of his most free spirited moments, Paul McCartney in rare moments spent away from his glistening bubbling and in experimentation. ERIC CLAPTON guests on this album. He GUESTS, ERIC PATRICK CLAPTON is not cool enough to be in this band. This album is that legendary, so all you damn new bands, listen to it. Forget about punk, forget Zeppelin, forget your cool music scenes or whatever you all call them. If you want to be worth anything, get this album, know it by heart, shut up and play. You guys don't know anything until the greatness of this band makes you cry. The Beatles proved that our music is worth everything, they are our band, there will never be a greater.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|COLDPLAY LIVE, what else can I say. If your a Fan of one of the greatest bands ever, then you need this for your collection. Because of the commercial success the band has recieved over the past year, it is getting harder and harder to get a ticket to see one of their shows. With this new DVD you can have your own private concert in the comfort of your own home anytime you want. When I heard they were going to come out with a live performance DVD, I was one of the first in line. I was in line and when the doors opened, I ran to the DVD section pushing people out of the way to get there and screamed in joy when I got my hands on it. Just joking about pushing people out of the way, I would never do anything like that, but I did scream for joy. I got a SHIVER when I popped the DVD in. This has a Live Concert with multi-angle features, you have a link to all their lyrics, and a bonus 40-minute Tour Diary documentary. Simply Amazing, and its all in Dolby Digital.<BR>  DON'T PANIC, stop looking at the ticking CLOCKS, EVERYTHING'S NOT LOST, put your POLITIK's aside, because when you watch this DVD it is like A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, and after it feels like GOD PUT A SMILE UPON YOUR FACE. I'll SEE YOU SOON.
B0000TB050|5.0|The Packaging<BR>The first surprise is that the DVD is available in two different kinds of packaging. One version comes in the usual digipack-cover as we know it from the Boston DVD. Inside you find the booklet in the usual DVD upsize format. The second version, in contrast, comes in a suprising format: its a standard cd jewel case with a booklet in the same format. A pretty unusual format for a DVD and day-to-day customers might easily mix up this version with a normal audio CD. <BR> <br />The Content<br />The DVD contains the entire slane castle concert from September 1st. 'Mysterious Ways' is not part of the concert, but listed as a 'bonus track'. The reasons for this are still unknown. The concert without Mysterious Ways lasts 1:38h, the bonus track is 6:26 min long. Furthermore the DVD contains a remastered version of the 'Unforgettable Fire' Documentary, which has been available before on the 'The Unforgettable Fire Collection' VHS from 1985. Bonus-Features include the already mentioned Mysterious Ways track, a DVD-ROM section with screensavers, desktop wallpapers, an elevation tour calendar and weblinks, plus - for the the first time ever - the possibility to view 3 songs from the show in a 360° perspective.<br />   <BR>The Concert<br />The most noticeable fact about this concert is the perfect mood the band was in on this evening. What seemed somewhat artificial and nervous in the Boston show, you can see much better here - the band enjoyed playing a second time in front of such a crowd at Slane Castle. Maybe it's the fact that it was not planned to release this concert for sale. Some incidents before the shows made both Slane concerts very emotional. The huge crowd brings a terrific spirit to the homes of all U2 fans, and the interaction with fans is much better here than in Boston.<BR>  <BR>Between songs Bono tells stories, plays games with fans and makes other kinds of jokes, all this makes the recording and U2 on this evening so likable. We pass on a song by song review, as we think that each viewer has to make up his own mind about this concert. We just want to point out that U2's mood and musical performance is outstanding. In comparision with all the other live videos this is the one which transports the feeling of a live concert best. All other videos tend to be stiff in some way or too well prepared. U2 at Slane Castle 2001 is the band U2 we want to see, they act with their hearts and have fun.<br />The Picture<br />The concert was recorded with many camera perspectives although Ned O'Hanlon said in an @U2.com interview that the expenses on that show were just a small fraction compared to the expenses for recording the Boston show. The spirit of the entire show is captured very well, shots from and of the audience are used very often and reflect its enthusiasm. The video format is 16:9, the pictures are sometimes very coarse, sometimes due to special effects, but this may have to do something with the light conditions during the shooting.<br />The Sound<br />This is the first time a U2 DVD is released with DTS sound, in addition to the PCM stereo format and DolbyDigital 5.1. But we think that for a normal user there is no relevant notable difference. Bonos voice is transferred very clearly via the centre speaker. The instruments are mixed to the front speakers, from the rear speakers you can notice quiet echoes, which are sometimes irritating. The audience is well mixed into the rear-speakers. There is no crystal clear mixing as can be found on DVDs like 'Eagles - Hell Freezes Over', where each instrument can be heard on a different channel. But maybe it's not comparable, because the Eagles show was a club-gig especially prepared for this, U2 in Slane was an open-air show which was, at the time of recording, not scheduled for a release.<br />The Extras<BR>'The Unforgettable Fire' documentary<BR>As mentioned before this is a remastered version of the 'Unforgettable Fire' documentary which follows the recordings of the album of the same name at Slane Castle in 1984. The video format is 4:3 and the documentary is 28 min long. The Documentary also includes the \\"Pride (In The Name of Love)\\" video. The picture quality is not the best, it's far away from DVD-quality. <BR>    <BR>Bonus-Track 'Mysterious Ways'<BR>Once the track list of the DVD became public, many fans were shocked as the same song which was already missing on the Boston DVD was once again cut out. For still unknown reasons the song was taken out of the usual running order of the DVD and instead placed as a bonus track. It is not as was rumoured (and feared) a so called \\"easter egg\\", but a normal track which can easily be accessed via the main menu. (Remark: Producer Ned O'Hanlon said in a recent interview that the song just didn`t really fit into the show).<br />DVD-Rom Bonus Tracks<br />The most anticipated special, the 360° view of the concert, ends up being a Quicktime video of the three songs Elevation, Beautiful Day and Where The Streets Have No Name. Users have the possibility to spin around 360° degrees in real time at the touch of their mouse. A real high-end-special-feature feeling unfortunately doesn't come across due to the lack of quality which reminds one of a cheap webcam.<br />The second special feature is the 'Elevation tour diary calendar and clock'.<br />Furthermore two screensavers in red and blue are available - their style matching the artwork of the DVD. Nice, but not really exciting.<br />Four desktop motives are available to polish up your Windows system. They are available in 1024x768 and 800x600 resolution. <br />Finally the obligatory links to U2.com and NGOs that are supported by U2 are featured. Exclusive weblinks are unfortunately missing.<BR>You can read the entire review with screenshots also in english at .....,..
B000001EUL|4.0|I was a huge fan of Scorpions while the still had Ulrich Roth.<BR>While I admit, they were more creative at that time, this is still a great CD. Even though they went more commercial, there is still plenty of creativity here plus Micheal Schenker. I still listen to this CD more often than most Scorps. They pretty much got it right here. Everything after sucks.
B000056WTC|4.0|Bruce Lee was great.  The story is a little corny (It is no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) but it is action packed.  Jim Kelly was also good and John Saxon shows some passable martial arts skills.  The final fight sequence in the maze of mirrors shows some spectacular directing and camera work.  It is a shame that Lee died so soon after just beginning to hone his acting skills.
0689859368|3.0|I read this book to see if it would be appropriate for my first grader and I liked the story and will let her read it. The artwork is really wonderful and the story has promise but it is so short!!! There is an old house, three children and fairy mischief but the action barely gets started in this book. I would recomend it for a younger reader who may get frustrated by reading a longer story. The artwork and story are great but it only got 3 stars because there's not much content for the price.
B00000JPHF|5.0|No class on horror films would be complete without this movie.  It was one of the first and still one of the best ever made.  The movie that made Boris Karloff and Colin Clive.  Jack Pierce provides the best make-up since Chaney's Phantom of the Opera.<br />Superb directing!  See the uncut version if you can.
B0000CAQ27|3.0|I was a little disappointed in Try This. I like Pink, but I think her lyrics are more vapid in this disc, and that it is a comedown from her amazing last album. It's not bad exactly, but it's not great either. For devoted fans only.
078062565X|5.0|One of the best monster films ever made.  The claymation and other effects were way ahead of its time and it was many years before they were surpassed.  <br />The scenes of old New York are great.  The acting was both corny and great at the same time.  The wreaking of the subway train and the closeups of Kong's face were excellent.  And who can forget the scenes at the top of the Empire State Building?
6305897786|5.0|I loved this film for its complexity, and for Depp's great acting. The story line was great, religion is always a good subject for movies. The whole Satan aspect was nice to see, instead of God being the subject. Makes you think and leaves much to the imagination.<br />Good DVD, Fantastic movie.
630179513X|3.0|This film is necessary to see to wrap up the loose ends from the second film but pales in quality to the prior 2.  Lloyd and Fox give excellent performances but the plot is lacking.  The ending of the film resolves the story but seemed to create some paradoxes.  <br />Not worth seeing this film unless you have seen both of the first two films.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Cusack was always been a mixed bag for me; sometimes I love him, sometimes I'm not, it's just that simple. \\"Identity\\" was a time that I really loved him. The movie is complex and confusing, but has an ending that actually answers all the questions brought to light, instead of leaving them to the viewer to decide what happened. Peet was a nice addition to the cast. A must see for mystery fans.<br />DVD is great so is the movie.
0671027387|4.0|This is one of those books that you just can't put down.  I read this one in record time.  It centers around the discovery of a meteorite at the North Pole that contains, what appears to be, exterrestial life.  Just judging by the title of the book you can determine that there is a ruse going on.  And those that stumble onto the deception must be eliminated.<br />The action is fact-paced and the characters are extremely intriguing!  I especially liked the scientists when they are so into themselves as being right that they just discount anyone that questions their analyses. Additionally, like the title also implies, not all the characters are what you think they are!<br />I would have rated this higher except that some of the escapes/rescues got so unbelievable that they insulted the reader's intelligence.
B00003CXSM|4.0|I liked this movie, but it shows the stiffness of the stars. I am a fan of Lopez and McConaughey, but here they seem out of place. Wilson was a good supporting actress, and the only one that seemed comfortable in her role. I would recommend seeing this movie, but probably not buying it.<br />Good DVD, some features, good soundtrack, O.K. movie.
B000083E79|5.0|Pushing 60 &amp; still on top of the world! There are very few things we can truely count on, fortunately for us there will always be the phenomenon known simply as CHER! This collection features her absolute best: Believe, Turn Back Time, Half-Breed, Take Me Home, Song For The Lonely and Bang Bang. My only complaint is that I would have loved for We All Sleep Alone to have been included, but I'm willing to wait another 40 years for it to be included on Volume 2. After all, we know Cher is eternal!
B00003CXFV|5.0|But certainly a good message, and excellent acting. Roberts has always been better at the romantic-comedy, but she does well in the role of Erin. Yet the acting is overtaken by the plot; one gets more involved with the story than with the actors (which can be good) and is good in this case. Not a family film, but certainly inspirational.<br />DVD is good, movie is great. Well deserved A.A. and long overdue.
B0000CAQ27|1.0|Well she's back again (though most of us wish she would just go away!). Pink, or is that P!nk...oh well I prefer Stink, gives us her 3rd offering of &quot;hardcore rock.&quot; Yeah right. The song &quot;Trouble&quot; had its debut on MTV not too long ago and fortunately they haven't played it into the ground, could this be a blessing? I saw Stink on Regis &amp; Kelly the other day and her accoustic performace was laughable. Her voice kept cracking and just wasn't there...not to mention she is starting to resemble Anna Nicole Smith nowadays. When Stink was standing next to Madonna, Regis &amp; Kelly it was downright shocking how much weight she has gained. She was easily twice the size of Kelly &amp; Madonna and thicker in the waist than Regis. I can only imagine what her handlers muct be thinking. Unless she is trying to be the Starr Jones of the music industry than she better get on Atkins pronto! I also see she has a song included on the new disc called &quot;Hooker.&quot; Well well well, still trying to pass her poseur badgirl image I see. What a zero-talent hack!
0792164903|5.0|Depp and Ricci shine in this unusual take on Irving's classic tale. I must admit is was skeptical of the film, but that was quickly dismissed by Burton't genius. The towns' people are very much how I would image them, and the story takes on a more mystical side that Irving gave it. One could almost say it is better than the original story. It is certainly more interesting.<br />DVD is great so is the movie.
B0000CAQ26|2.0|I am disappointed with this album. I wanted more songs like the 2nd album. This one is too punk and I think the public will not catch on, witness first song Trouble getting no airplay in NY. I'll give it a few more listens to be fair because I like Pink but I may just sell it soon, if I don't find a few songs that I can latch onto.
0671015206|4.0|AH! The cat is out of the bag. This book is holy. The authors saved me from a life of defeat. You see I never had any body give me a picture of what it took to be rich. I yearned wealth so badly I could taste it but still it eluded me. I would be the one buying expensive...(You name it). I still occasionally backslide but I no longer have the wool pulled over my eyes. I bought this book in 2000 and that is when I realized I can have what I really want and enjoy having things without struggle. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is because, I still have a little part of me that wants to live in a palace, have my own helicopter pad, a jet landing strip, and live a hedonist lifestyle before I get too old. I don't want to be married and I want outer trappings of wealth not neccessarily as many clothes but, automobiles that can at least give the athletes a slight run for there money.I definitely reccommend this book I occasionally pull it out as a reminder even three years later. It is my friendly reminder.The millionaire mind I reccommend as well it gave me a clothing strategy. Take care and I hope this book do for you what it did for me.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|if I hear one more person say this movie was better then the first.. I might just cut his berrys off and make fruitpunch. this movie was good but not as good as they made it sound (coff!,MTV aka the youth brainwashing channel,coff!).i guess the biggest reason I hate this movie so much is tyrese.<BR>(Mr.im a hardcore thug eversince I made babyboy<BR>oh yah and paul walker :) (Mr. look at me I always have my hair combed nice and clean little shirts on) sorry that was all I could come up with :(<BR>and ludacris? well atleast they didnt get Ja Rule again i guess<BR>but anyway the film was less realistic this time around then the first. meaning the whole jump a car on a boat thing and um, the whole all i gotta do is go in this building and a gazillion billion fricking cars come racing out to throw off cops(all that happend in like 15 minutes? ludacris called all them people?)<BR>the extras on the dvd are a pluss lots a stuff in there<BR>a little complicating but it pays off I guess<BR>some movies just shouldnt have sequals and this is one a them, this is a story not a frickin trilogy.<BR>cant wait to 20000times faster 20000times furious<BR>when paul walker and whoever is in space ships<BR>ok thats all, screw this movie<BR>ima go wach mtv (pun intended)
B0000CD5I6|5.0|All my friends know I am a Tull fanatic, and every Christmas they joke \\"do Tull have a Christmas album?\\" Well joke no more dear friends!<BR>This is an outstanding album worthy of the praise it has received!<BR>Guess what you all are getting from me for Christmas?
B00005JMFR|2.0|Ever since coming out of the movie theatre after seeing The Matrix: Reloaded, my mind had been thinking over and over about the possible great endings to such a phenomenon. I was thinking perhaps that the Wachowski brothers had purposely left us very on edge for a mind-blowing conclusion to this sci-fi epic. Well, very sadly, I was wrong. Friends of mine and I had increasing anticipation for Revolutions, expecting so much from it, which only made the end result even more depressing.<br />After both The Matrix and Reloaded, you thought that the brothers could not go wrong, they were able to create the story in 1999, sustain its mystique and action in May 2003, but have no idea how to end such a complex saga. Everything was perfect, even down to the soundtracks - you knew that they couldn't go wrong at this point. And it's such a shame that it all ended the way it did, I sat in my seat of the theatre just thinking \\"that cannot be the end?!?! It can't be!\\", expecting there to be another scene of dialogue to explain absolutely everything, to give all the answers... but it never came. Instead, you got a very cliched ending, which would annoy every one of the hardcore Matrix fans out there - the philosophy had vanished, the amazing kung-fu sequences, and coolness of the all black look and sunglasses - all for a cold Zion and a dull feeling while watching the film. I regret for what I will write, I hate criticising this film because of the greatness of the first two but certain things have to be said. I had no idea that such an ending was coming.<br />Continuing exactly where Reloaded left off, you find both Neo and Agent Smith (in human form as Bane) in a coma, and the humans preparing for battle against the machines who are drilling their way through to Zion. Then you find Neo in a world between worlds - between the real world and the matrix, with you having no idea how he got there. The story then speaks for itself. With some poor pieces of dialogue, used ideas and too many special effects - Revolutions was nothing special compared to its predecessors.<br />The Matrix - all about those beautifully choreographed fight scenes, interesting philosophical conversation and the cool all black costumes: this was not to be in the third instalment. There are two, very brief hand-to-hand combat scenes (including the final showdown with Neo Vs Smith) and an overlong CGI sentinel battle, which was not what Matrix action sequences were about. Yes, have some gunfire and explosions, but you know it was really all about how much arse could be kicked by Neo, Morpheus and Trinity. Impressive yes, but Revolutions did not really look, or even feel, like a Matrix movie. It didn't have any would-be favourite lines, memorable, yet inspirational lines by Morpheous, like the previous two films had. To put it simply, it just wasn't as enjoyable nor as gripping as the first or as action packed as the second. And the ending fight scene, the one we all had really been looking forward to, was a huge let down, especially coming from the Wachowski brothers - you get tired of too much flying and not enough actual fighting between the two men, it gets very confusing indeed. And Neo being \\"The One\\" certainly doesn't act it because he is made to look weak against Smith in the end. You were maybe thinking, \\"Ok, this is what we have all been waiting for at last\\" but, to put it simply, no.<br />Character development was another big factor in this film - there was none! The Merovigian, the comical French program, had only enough screen time to eat just three olives. You would have thought that this guy had a lot to do with the Matrix, as Reloaded had made him out to be an important, dangerous person, but his character is cut short in a very blunt way, you don't even find out who he is or what he does. And for his wife? In short - she has one line. Plus, too many new characters were introduced here, and took up way too much screen time and were insignificant to the story.Keanu Reeves was off screen for the majority of the film... and he's \\"The One\\", the main character. And Morpheus? The producers had not only put a knife in Laurence Fisburne's back, but a bullet as well, as he had no real part in this film. His scenes were too short and he did not have enough lines to say.<br />I suppose visual effects really saved this film, as the plot spiralled out of control, becoming way to complex, even for the Wachowski's to comprehend - they either lost interest, ran out of special effects, or most likely ran out of ideas. They spent three months just designing the rain drops in the battle between Neo and Smith! That three months could have been spent on the ending at least, let alone the whole film itself. Which makes you wonder - why release both films in such a rush? It seems in the four years the spent making the two, all efforts were concentrated on trying to make Reloaded the great follow up success that it is, then only leaving just enough time to fit in two fight scenes and a sentinel attack for the third instalment. To be honest, I would have rather waited an extra year, perhaps even more, for a really good ending rather then a quickly put together climax, because I had favoured the strategy of leaving so many unanswered questions, a mystery - then for them to explain it all, end it completely in Revolutions. It never happened.<br />But now, as I and many others have witnessed, there will be an eternal disappointment and resentfulness to Revolutions and how great it could have been, I hope the Wachowski's realise this as much as we do.y.

B0000CAQ26|4.0|she's done it again. in a world of canned music, Pink has, yet again, poured her heart and life into a new album that's an honest reflection of her. here's a rundown of my favorite tracks off the album that includes more grunge, r&amp;b, dance and rock.<br />(my favorite tracks)<BR>1-try this- you've probably heard it. not doin too well on the<BR>            charts but you can't please everyone<BR>2-god is a dj- the next single, pretty cool dance song<BR>6-catch me while i'm sleeping- a cool, slow r&amp;b song<br />7-waiting for love- arguably pink's best vocal performance on the<BR>                    album. somber, think Dave Matthews Band or<BR>                    Goo Goo Dolls<BR>8-save my life-biographical rock song, good lyrics<BR>12-unwind-i can't stop listenin to this track. it's pink's funky<BR>          ode to janis joplin which explains why the lyrics say<BR>          &quot;i'm 27 years old&quot; when pink is actually 24. (joplin<BR>          died at 27). her most soulful vocals on the album, it<BR>          sounds like she was at church when she sang this song.<BR>13-love song- a nice, slow r&amp;b song that sounds like it could've<BR>          been on Can't Take Me Home. a possible dedication to <BR>          boyfriend carey hart (are they still together??) very<BR>          well-written and sung, also i hear that on the actual<BR>          cd, if you let this track play there's another bonus <BR>          song at the end, i haven't heard it.<br />overall, pink has pulled off another great, heartfelt and personal album, but like she says in interviews, it is a little more light-hearted than missundaztood, even the sadder songs like unwind and save my life are more uptempo. the only reason i give this album 4 instead of 5 stars is there's only 13 tracks and i'm sure she had more songs that could've fit into this album but it's still worth the $$ and i hope she does another tour. i missed the last one but i'd love to hear waiting for love and unwind live,all of her smokin has given her voice even more of a rasp and she still sings incredibly. my advice, real pink fans should definitely try this, it's in stores now.
B000060P79|5.0|I love this cd! Pierre has a very very cute voice. I love their songs Perfect,Addicted,and id do anything! I think this cd was great. They sound like fun outgoing guys and there is nothing in their songs that is dirty or disgusting like most music today. The music isnt really like rock or anything hardcore its popish rock! it sounds really really good though!
B0000DYJM6|4.0|First off, this is a teriffic cd.  Everything from the songs to the packaging is quality stuff.  Having said that, I have a few gripes (probably weak gripes, but it's my opinion).  1., no Vitalogy outtakes, 2., No Merkin Ball songs (Long Road & I Got Sh*t), 3.  No State of Love & Trust (IMO the best song from the Ten era), 4. Not enough songs.<BR>Now I realize the last gripe may not hold up b/c there are 31 songs on this album (hidden track after Bee Girl).  This does however give me hope that PJ will release another rarities album.  They have SO many songs that they could easily put 2 more rarities albums out.<BR>Ok, on with the album....<BR>Disc one flat out rocks!  All Night really sets the tone for the disc, and is quite the gem from the No Code sessions.  Other highlights for me include the cool 60's rock diddy Gremmie Out of Control, the garage rocker Black Red Yellow, and the Binaural outtakes Sad, & Education.  Many of theses B sides are quite suprising, and in some cases better than  the songs that made the albums.<BR><BR>Disc 2 is much more somber and reflective, again, the first song [Fatal] sets the tone.  Personal highlights include:  Dead Man, Otherside, Wash, Footsteps, and Drifting.  Dead Man is quickly becoming one of my favorite slower PJ songs (my fave being Off He Goes).  People seem to have mixed reviews for Drifting.  The best version of it is on the Boston 3 bootleg from the '03 tour.  Anyway, it's a cool song, and the linear notes for it say it all.  Which is another cool thing about Lost Dogs -- the Linear Notes.  Every song is reflected by a member of the band stating where they were at the time, or what they were thinking when the song was written.  All in all this is a must have for anyone who truley appreciates rock music, and the early 90's sound.  A lot of these songs really showcase PJ at their best, and prove they were and still are ahead of the curve.
B00005JMFR|5.0|AS FAR AS ACTION AND SPECIAL EFFECTS GO, REOADED BEATS REVOLUTIONS.  BUT, AS FAR AS A GOOD STORY, REVOLUTIONS WHOOPS RELOADED.  PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT RELOADED WAS THE FIRST PART OF AN INCOMPLETE MINISERIES.  REVOLUTIONS IS THE CONCLUSION AND ENDS IT WONDERFULLY.  GREAT ACTION AND SPECIAL EFFECTS.  WHEN THAT GIANT SWARM OF SENTINELS BARREL THROUGH THE CEILINGS OF ZION, I COULD HEAR MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE THEATRE GASPING.  THE FINAL CONFRONTATION WITH THE MACHINES, NEO AND AGENT SMITH ALONE WAS WORTH THE ADMISSION.  PEOPLE WHO TRASHED RELOADED IN THIER REVIEWS NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE.  THEY WILL APPRECIATE RELOADED MUCH MORE SINCE THE SERIES IS NOW COMPLETE.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I thought that this was a good effort by Sarah.  like many diehard fans, I have been waiting a long time for this album!.  I have to say although Fallen is the most popular song, Push, Answer, Drifting, Trainwreck and Time are my favorites.  I like the way the songs are constructed.  But I like the more stripped down songs such as Dirty Little Secret with just Sarah's gorgeous voice, the piano, and the violin.  As one reviewer said, Sarah's voice seems to be layered under many different instruments and production in many songs.  I also love Answer for that reason and Trainwreck also.  I would reccommend Fumbling Towards Ecstasy for a first time Sarah fan.  But she's coming from a different place more mature.  Although I find this album darker than her previous fare, I like her lyrics.  Such as: &quot;Leave me be I don't want to argue, I just get confused and I come all undone&quot; and &quot;I will be the answer at the end of the line&quot;.  She is still one of my favorite artists and one of the most observant.  I truly like this album and will give it a few more listens.
B000089RVR|5.0|Where people will use fifty-dollar words (or Pound or Euro as the case may be) to criticize this album to pieces, the seeming simplicity elegantly woven into the subtle drumbeats and light strings from guitar to violin repel even the most charged of insults to Dido's craft.<br />For her part, Dido offers a heartfelt work compared to the head-thumping, foot-stomping, tweaky, hoo-hah that people think of when they listen to the top 40's.  Her lyrics are straightfoward, offering a sense of longing; neuroses that are common for everyone who's ever loved; moving for the messages that flow without screeching or glass-shattering over-vocalizing.  The title track, &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, is indicative of this.<br />Personally, the only thing that would make me drive the score down from five is that the radio stations are hell-bent on burning out one song after another when the whole album is well worth the time to listen to.
B00007KQKM|5.0|Brilliant! I bought this movie because of Sean Bean (I just wanted to hear him saying \\"lass\\"...) and because I love british drama. I just finished it and I am not disappointed. What a great story! I do believe that the sex scenes are far from being shocking, they are justified, intense and beautiful. The previous reviews say it all - great story, adaptation, characters... over 200 minutes very, very well spent.I'll let the tears dry now.
B00000DG1R|3.0|Duran Duran had several hits. Some of which made it on here. If you like the band, I would recomend this compilation. <br />And a note to Cranky Reviewer....<br />To compare Duran Duran (who fit thier &quot;greatest&quot; onto one CD) to Bob Dylan (The Voice of a Generation) is just horrid. To dislike a genre of music is your own choice, but I would think twice before you bare your ignorance for all to see
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Reading the other reviews, I felt I had to submit one myself. As a fan from the beginning, I thing TOT is a move in the right direction after the keyboard saturated 6DOIT. Being a piano/keyboard player, it's hard fo me to say less keyboards, but in this case it was necessary. I worship Rudess, but I felt too much of a good thing hurt 6DOIT. This disc gets better and better with each listen. Although the melodic DT is great, this heavier stuff is really what they're all about. They are as tight as always. Petrucci and Portney are still at the top of their craft. More Myung is necessary, but his work is not unnoticed and LaBrie sounds stronger than I expected on this disc. Personal favorites: &quot;As I Am&quot; and &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;. I was worried after 6DOIT, but they  have re-established my faith and I'll recommend this to everyone. Can't wait to see them live!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|To be fair I am a long time Neil Young fan. I watched the DVD then listened to the CD after the 2nd time through I was hooked... Love this CD. Simple, straight forward, The real Neil.
B000002NAK|5.0|I love this soundtrack and I am not a big Madonna fan, okay I am, but in this soudtrack she is outstanding. I only wish it had the entire movie on it, but that is unrealistic. I love this soundtrack so much and I think it is amazing.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I have this movie and I watched the trailer for it and the second half of the trailer it plays a song.  I really like this song but dont think it is on the soundtrack. If anyone knows the name of this song that I am talking about please let me know!!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Of course I was going to buy this colection.  While I had a good bit of the songs on Lost Dogs, there were more than enough that I didn't have to warrant buying it.  But when listening to the songs, I noticed that most of the songs (Yellow Ledbetter being one exception) appear here as either remixes, rerecordings, or alternate takes.  They don't mention anything about it in the liner notes, but anyone who has heard the original versions of Dirty Frank, Wash, Alone, Down, and others will hear differences to the songs.  Wash has the harmonica absent on the Jeremy single.  Dirty Frank is without the Chili Peppers bit and only one Shaft bit.  Alone has slightly different lyrics.  Others have subtle changes (louder guitar, etc).  But these are different enough that it is a nice suprise for those of us who have most of the songs already.<br />As for the ones that I hadn't heard, there are some real gems on this album.  Sad is fantastic.  Brother is a quality instrumental.  Fatal is another that could have easily been on any album.  <br />For Pearl Jam fan out there, this is a must have.
B00000099Y|5.0|This CD represents what every artist strives for.  Well, at least those who are true to themselves as well as the music.  It is a journey into the mind and soul, a discovery and realization of who we are.  Powerful and hypnotic, it has been a huge influence to my own songwriting.  I can only hope HYALINE makes music that is as inspiring and real in character.  This album represents what has been lost in many of today's bands.  A no-holds-barred courageous approach to art and self expression.  It is only when we let go of fear and stand naked in front of the crowd that we truly expose the soul.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I think this movie is positively groundbreaking. It is completely jaw-dropping and stunning. I could watch this movie over and over and over again. BUY IT! It rocks!!
B00005NB0H|5.0|Yes, you have James Brown at the Apollo, The Rollings Stones \\"Ya-Ya's\\" & Kiss \\"Alive\\" (had to slip in that last one), but this one tops them all.  I would give this 100 stars if I could.<BR>Yes, the sound on disc two is a little thin & over-overprocessed.<BR>Yes, some of Daltry's vocals have been recently overdubbed (to the shagrin of Who purists).<BR>Yes, the show is not in the original running order.<BR>But....\\"Who\\" cares!  The power and fury  captured on these discs has never been equaled on any live recording before or after.  Townshend, Entwistle & Moon.  There are really no words to describe the musical brilliance created by these three musicians.  The sum of their talent is truely greater than the idividual parts.  Top that with one of the greatest rock vocalist of all time, Roger Daltrey, and I rest my case.<BR>This release needs to be part of any serious collection.<BR>If you are new to \\"The Who\\", I strongly advise this release, the \\"Who's Next\\" Deluxe edition and the new 2 cd Deluxe Edition of the \\"Tommy\\" album in one swift super-saver purchase.  If you love rock music there is absolutley no way you will be disappointed.
B00005JM02|5.0|The recently released DVD, Finding Nemo, has rapidly and easily become my new favorite Disney production. I would even go on to say that it is one of this years best films. It contains amazing animation and extras which make the picture flawless. This tale will truly have you on the floor laughing while at the same time warming your heart.<BR>  The story begins with Marlin and Coral, two clown fish who recently moved to a new neighborhood near a coral reef. Here they hoped to safely raise their children, who at this point are still eggs. Tragedy strikes though, Coral and all but one of her eggs are murdered by a baracuda. Now Marlin is left alone to raise his one child, Nemo. <BR>   As Nemo grows older his father grows more protective. Marlin is even reluctant to allow Nemo to start school. Against his best judgement Marlin allows Nemo to begin school. While in class Nemo goes beyond the reef and out into the open sea, where he is then captured by a SCUBA diver who lives in Sydney, Australia.<BR>   Marlin, mortified by his only sons disappearance, embarks on a long journey in hopes to rescue his son. Along the way Marlin meets Doris, a spunky fish with a short term memory problem who helps him on his voyage. They encounter many obstacles like, sharks, a deep sea creature, stinging jelly fish, and crazy seagulls. There were also nice creatures along the way who help Marlin and Doris and spread the tragic story about the sea. My favorite friend to Marlin was Crush, a one hundred and Fifty year old sea turtle with a surfer bum attitude. He was Hilarious and very helpfull at the same time.<BR>   The rest of Marlin's journey and Nemo's where abouts can remain a surprise. One can be assured though that the ending is exciting and leaves you feeling good. I insist that everyone see this movie at least once, and trust me you will be satisfied!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Write reviews that is. I'm doing it to balance out all the truly unfair reviews right beneath mine. I'm usually moved to give an opinion only for something I've spent money on that I really, really love or really, really hate. In both cases, I usually find that my emotional judgment of the product's quality impedes giving an intelligent, well reasoned, balanced opinion. Now that I've blathered on pointlessly for about four lines, you're probably wondering if it's love or hate here. Wonder no longer. It's love. So you'll forgive the lack of intelligence, good reason, and balance.<br />I. Love. This. Album. I don't consider myself a music expert, but I think I have decent taste in music. Sure, I've liked Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, Radiohead, the Strokes, and blah blah blah every other band Interpol is compared to. Forget all that for a second. This is an essential recording for music lovers. It instantly gained a place on my shelf next to OK Computer, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Doolittle, Slanted and Enchanted...in short, the ones I hold in highest regard and listen to with devout frequency.<br />I probably heard this CD 6 or 7 times in my ex boyfriend's car, completely ignoring it. (It usually came on after Linkin Park, so my expectations were set at low.) To me they sounded like Coldplay wannabes or something. Forget all the fancy name dropping these indie snobs like to do, I wasn't even hearing that. All that dense noise. I wasn't paying attention.<br />Fast-forward half a year. I listen to my impulsively acquired illegal download of \\"PDA\\" 3 or 4 times, admiring the cool full stop in the middle of the song. Then I listen some more. All of a sudden, the song opens up. Becomes penetrable. And there is so much there. So I downloaded \\"Obstacle 1.\\" The next morning, I immediately purchased Turn on the Bright Lights. This album is worth every penny. Trust me. You just have to give it a chance. <br />The only thing I could possibly object to is that sometimes, just sometimes, the songs have really silly lyrics. &quot;My best friend's from Poland and um he has a beard.&quot; No thanks. &quot;Love is in the kitchen with a culinary eye/ Think he's making something special and I'm smart enough to try.&quot; Right. But they more than make up for it. For every &quot;Her stories are boring and stuff/She's always calling my bluff,&quot; there's a line like &quot;Homespun desperation's knowing/inside, your cover's always blown.&quot; Say that out loud. <br />Musically, this record is tight. Yes, it shows influences, but it is much more reminiscent of these influences than out and out derivative. Lead singer has beautiful, distinctive, and yes, original vocals and delivery (insert Ian Curtis reference here, although the comparison is not entirely fair.)The songs are complex, lush, melodic...just plain beautiful. Breathtakingly emotional without cloying. Melodramatic without being trite. I won't pretend to know the music theory that explains why this record works. No talk about &quot;amorphous drums,&quot; tonal shifts, or chord progressions here (although I know enough to say that the production here is fantastic.) All I know is, it works.  I've listened to it probably about 20 or 30 times now. And it's still amazing.<br />BOTTOM LINE: Don't listen to these overblown negative reviews (really, I would be suspicious of any reviewer who gives 1 star to a record that got plenty of acclaim. Two stars, ok. But one? I'm not saying critics know it all, but can so many of them be THAT wrong?) <br />This record is an outstanding aesthetic experience, emotionally and intellectually engaging to the point of being addictive. Don't hesitate to buy it.
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney Houston has always been my favorite female musicians and i think she does a good job in all her songs.<br />The song `Waitng to Exale' has been one song that can up lift ones thoughts and feelings. It has a direct meaning thats unquestionabe.It certainly captures ones mind especially where women are concerned.It surely uplifted my thoughts.<br />she  really expresses how a women feels after she has been cheated and waisted.one can actually feel the hate of a women wh has been cheated on in her voice.she says that sometimes she cries and feels like killing someone.but, that doesnt happen instead she takes that cheater back in her life.<br />Whitney plays the role of the strength and tolerance of a women in love in this song.she also mentions the diffent things that a women can do for the love of men and money.i just love her flow and lyrics in this song.she also presented this song in her movie Wating To Exale.which was well acted.<br />I think she did a tremondous job in this song everything was well presented, the soundtrack,lyrics,flow and most of all the beautiful and amazing voice.
B000002UA0|5.0|This album may not be for everyone, but to these ears, Piper At the Gates of Dawn is one of the finest works from the psychedelic era. The album's title was taken from a chapter in Barrett's favorite children's book Wind in the Willows. Syd Barrett (who wrote most of the songs) often displayed a lighthearted, playful and humorous quality in his lyrical imagery. This would put Piper at odds most of Pink Floyd's later work for that reason alone, since the latter day Pink Floyd seemed to favor themes more on the serious and depressing side. That did not stop 1970's Pink Floyd from having great albums in their own right though. I think that most of the negative reviews may be from people who either are not particularly interested in the 60's, or just haven't given the album the attention it deserves. <BR> <BR> The band has a unique instrumental style here characterized by eerie Farfisa organ and an unusual, almost percussive lead guitar style. The opening track Astronomy Domine takes off, and brings the listener on a hallucinogenic journey all throughout space. Some of the tracks, like the instrumental Interstellar Overdrive, feature excellent improvisation by the musicians that can not really be categorized. Most of the songs are well-crafted and around or under three minutes. The Gnome and The Scarecrow are interesting folkish character sketches from Barrett. Matilda Mother has intriguing words, and an Arabian-like organ solo. Flaming has unusual lyrics, drifting into a brief and relaxing instrumental section before coming back to the final verse. Lucifer Sam \\"Siam cat\\" possibly dealt with duality, (\\"you're the left side, he's the right side\\") with Barrett's guitar sounding like a cat's moan in places. Waters' only contribution was the absurd Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk, which featured some truly intense instrumental freak-outs with piercing organ and ball-bearings run up and down the guitar strings. My favorite track is Chapter 24, which has hopeful lyrics wedded to soothing music. There is also some excellent vocal harmony on this track.<BR> <BR> Overall, I strongly recommend buying Piper At the Gates of Dawn if you are interested in 60's psychedelia. Syd Barrett drew from many literary influences in his work, and seems to have been quite an interesting character. The whimsical British nature is also quite appealing. Since I am more into the 60's, this might be my favorite Floyd album. Strongly recommended folks!
B0000DD7UB|5.0|I was really scared for Pink thinking that she had changed her style and would not be able to top songs like Dont Let Me Get Me, Like A Pill, and Get The Party Started.  She definately has.  I was suprisingly pleased with this CD.  She went with a more Happy and not so Mad self.  Her songs have more energy and fun.  She has quite a few songs in different genres.  R&amp;B, Punk Rock, Soft Rock, and Dance.  I really did not like the entire Mizunderstood album but I heard this Cd once in my car and it was great, and the songs were catchy.  Usually When I hear a cd for the first time I hear a few songs and then go back to the beginning of the disk.  In this case I did not have the chance, becasue all the songs were so good.  I am very happy and proud of her, and although her methods and images might be a little unorthodox, well thats what makes her Pink.  The Dvd has the video and behind the scenes clips, pic and lyrics.  It really is not a big deal but for the same price try to get it.  ALso I have not heard the clean version but the foul one does not have a lot of cursing but not good for kids, get the clean.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil is one of the most beautiful melodramatic bands I have heard.  I don't see the comparison between Lacuna Coil and Evanescence.  Lacuna Coil sounds different and by-far better.  They have something called talent.  Cristina Scabbia has wonderful vocals and they are awesome to be seen live.  Listen to Lost Lullaby and Stars if you think they aren't good.  Evanescence is one-hit-wonder pop rock and has nothing on Lacuna Coil.

B0000CAQ27|5.0|I first heard of Pink when i heard the song, &quot;Ther You Go&quot; and immediately bought the 1st ablum Cant Take Me Home and I was pleased. When the second album was released I was surprised by the new sound of Get The Party Started and it sounded a bit manufactured, but nonetheless I bought the lbum as a faithful P!NK fan I am and was beyond satisifed. It was fantastic and selling over 4 million was incredible, but I was unsure if she could top this with Try This. As you may know the 1st single Trouble stormed MTV when it dethrowned Outkast's Hey Ya from the countdown. At that I knew it would be huge! i bought this album and it blew me away. Its a totally different sound and I luv it!<BR>I rated all the songs with a description for u have any hesiattions!!<br />1. Trouble- Great, short song that rocks and a crowd pleaser. 9 out of 10<BR>2. God is A DJ- Next single, softer and a song that will mostly please crowds like Don't Let Me Get Me did with its sound ~9<BR>3. Last To Know- I would predict this to be the biggest of them all, rocks hard, with all the qualuities of a #1 hit on Billboard.com despite what other users say ~ 10 <BR>4. Tonight's The Night- song about getting in touble and partying late~ 8 <BR>5. Oh my God~ Nice song that would not be a single but great to listen to~ 7 <BR>6. Catch Me While Im Sleeping - Christmas feeling for couples, nice melody and chorus~ 9 <BR>7. My second favorite song, could be 4th single, shows off her vocals~10<BR>8. Save My Life- sad but true to life~ 8<BR>9. Trying Too hard- plain and simple, good song~ 7<BR>10. Humble Neighborhood- get ready for Pink's rap! It rocks hard though, a spin on rap Pinks style LUV THIS SONG ~10<BR>11. Walk Away- break-up song, good and simple~ 8<BR>12. Unwind- great song with a great vibe, ~ 9<BR>13. Love Song- short and unfinished with no chorus or verses but shows off all vocal talent in a way you've never heard, equivalent of XChristina Aguilera's vocals in The Voice Within except in Pink'sown way!~10<BR>HIDDEN TRACK- Not my favorite~ 7<br />Her album deserves a 10!!!!!

B00000JMOF|5.0|After repeated attempts of securing a Frankenstein, director James Whale hired a middle-aged character actor named William Henry Pratt (stage name: Boris Karloff) who had previously been limited to cameos, stand-ins, and predominantly small eccentric parts to play Frankenstein's monster. Karloff's restrictive age, massive obscurity, and absence of experience may have emerged as hindrances for this newly discovered personality. However, time and popular opinion has obliterated these fears into long lost paranoid hallucinations. <br />It is Boris Karloff's indisputably iconic and singularly haunting performance as the child-like brute, misunderstood and despised by all, who's only longing and desire is to be loved and cared for by others that continues to be one of cinema's timeless jewels of acting perfection, dramatic magnitude, and note-fully seamless pathos. Karloff's monster, like Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates or Robert De Nero's Travis Bickle, is one of cinema's fortunate accidents of how the exact casting of just the right perfect someone can unbelievably bolster the film. Karloff's casting as the inevitably sympathetic artificial concoction of a mad scientist with a deity complex turned out to be one of many grandiose happy accidents that has allowed this 70 year-old Gothic horror film to continue to be copiously admired, internationally beloved, and enthusiastically cherished up to contemporary times. <br />Frankenstein retains numerous stellar elements including a magnificently captivating early sound ensemble cast including Edward Van Sloan (Doctor Waldman), Mae Clarke (Elizabeth), Frederick Kerr (Baron Frankenstein), Dwight Frye (Fritz), and the unforgettable Colin Clive, the archetypal mad scientist, (Henry Frankenstein), brilliantly provocative Frankenstein make-up by make-up genius Jack Pierce, manically splendid and cleverly articulated German Expressionistic sets, that place this tale in an indescribable alternate Grimm Fairy Tale reminiscent landscape, James Whales immeasurably eloquent moral consolidation and inventively multi-faceted interpretation of Mary Shelly's tale, and forever crowned with one of cinema's most cunningly virtuoso and unredeemable bravura performances of inarticulate primal indignation and childish rage ever recorded on film by Karloff as the monster. <br />However due to it's age and Hollywood production values at the time, Frankenstein is not totally absent of problems: lacking of a musical score to counter-match the film's profuse talkativeness, predictably saddled with pedestrian and extremely dated comedic and romantic sub plots, and weakened by an awfully trite comedic conclusion. Despite these blemishes, Frankenstein consummately embodies the finest narrative qualities of the early Universal monster films, contains the simply greatest incarnation of Frankenstein's monster, and stubbornly remains both in ambiance and creative evocativeness the finest film version of the Mary Shelly story.<br />Either virtually creating or establishing the most memorable template for many of the horror genre's most blessed clichés and stereotypes including the angry mob laced with the burning torches and sharp pitchforks, the rustically appearing European town, the burning windmill, the broadly mentally troubled mad scientist, the tragically misinterpreted monster, the lavishly designed laboratory machinery, the chronically sadistic hunchback, and the supposed evil psychological significance of lightning. James Whale's Frankenstein remains an altogether manifestly influential film landmark that has predisposed numberless incalculable sequels, remakes, homages, and spoofs to habitually exhume its timeworn formula over the last seventy years. <br />One only has to warmly revisit this beloved perpetual love letter of the classical macabre to immediately lovingly recap its' resplendent spoils of immortality time after exultant time to re-experience all of the perpetual sacrosanct celluloid epiphanies that compose James's Whales Frankenstein and are eternal adjectives of film all by themselves. Imagine the following: the incessant utterance of Dr. Henry Frankenstein's immortally poetic verbally lyrical realization of success, &quot;Look! It's moving. It's alive. It's alive.. It's alive, it's moving, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive, IT'S ALIVE!&quot; Following this volcanic explosion of scientific fervor the near psychotically elated scientific heretic beguilingly exclaims, &quot;Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!&quot; Who couldn't instantaneously vividly recall the tense furious physical caginess, grotesquely gyrated sweat marinated facial contortions, eye ballet of the pathological, the authentically grisly euphoric vocal earnestness of absolute discovery, and the very specific details of the man that was (and agelessly is with it's fortunate restoration and preservation on film) Colin Clive's Henry as he fervently serenades those hallowed words of revelation with a primordially unnerving flirtatiously ricocheting salvo of eternal laughter that essentially biblically jettisons sanity away from the film itself, for that moment. <br />In an ethereal totalitarian rush of such narrative spiritual possession and sheer air-tight uncanny intensity, the viewer is ultimately left spiritually adrift in a wanton cinematic wasteland of unnaturally insurmountable depravity where for the moment the clandestine doesn't even seem conceivable. Virtually nothing else in the medium of film has ever been able to produce this peculiar ambiance of malignant domination of film storytelling since. With the possible exceptions of Janet Leigh's liquid demise and Anthony Perkins's earnest feminine confessional in Hitchcock's Psycho, the lynch-party triumph at the end of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, and Anthony Hopkins nonchalant walking towards a Caribbean dinner engagement in Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs, James Whales's Frankenstein endurably inhabits the uncommon role of rarefied unicorn of cinematic perfection, and that's not likely to falter anytime soon.<BR> <BR>Talk about staying power!!! <br />As for Frankenstein's DVD format, it contains a uncannily pristine Pan and Scan standard presentation, a 45 minute absorbingly intriguing making-of documentary, film historian Rudy Behlmer's consistently stellar illuminating time-defying chronological exodus of a film audio commentary, original theatrical trailer, a short 1930's fictional film subject entitled Boo!, and much more. <br />Universally (pun intended) recommended to anyone interested in film classics, the Universal Monster films, or the everlasting time repelling landmark films of the 1930's. Followed by James Whales' superior sequel The Bride of Frankenstein (1935).

B00005QFE5|5.0|This is one of my all-time favourite films. A beautiful and poignant romantic tale set in a remote Chinese village, which tells of an enduring love between two young people in rural China. The emotions are vivid and memorable, this really is an extraordinarily beautiful story - with superb filmmaking and breathtaking scenery.<br />Can't recommend it enough. I subscribed to a 'World Movie Channel' just so that I could get this film on tape!
B000001FOL|5.0|I must admit that for a long time Nico kind of seemed like a joke. I was never a fan of her vocals on Velvet &amp; Nico, so I never gave this album a shot. Then, 2 months ago in the forest, I was tripping on mushrooms and heard the most beautiful music in the world coming from somewhere in the distance. I went to see what it was and found Chelsea Girl. I sat and heard the whole album and when it was done, I cried my eyes out. I deeply regret putting this album down and not giving it a shot. Don't make the same mistake I made.
B0000009TK|5.0|If you're new to Zappa's catalogue then it can be very daunting to decide what to try out.  The man had so many releases and jumped across so many styles that there's no real guarantee that any particular release will do it for you.<br />This album is great for any of you who want to hear Zappa leading a TIGHT, TIGHT band playing mostly instrumental music.  There are plenty of &quot;jams&quot; in the jazz sense of the word, not the Grateful Dead sense of the word.  In other words, instrumentalists improv within a tight technical structure but the full band never drifts out into unrehearsed meanderings.  More than any other release since Waka/Jawaka, this album makes me appreciate Zappa as a composer and bandleader.  The man was a force!<br />Having heard well over half of Zappa's output before picking this up, I was a little surprised that it became one of my favorite listens almost immediately.  I didn't realize just how good the '88 band was.  And, I confess, the relative paucity of stage antics and jokes is actually somewhat refreshing.  I just want to hear them play!
1559408855|5.0|From Disney's Pixar Entertainment comes a film for the whole family:  Pasolini's &quot;Salo.&quot;  A heartwarming tale of bonding under the worst of circumstances, &quot;Salo&quot; will tug at your heartstrings.  Some family films feature a lovable animal or an adorable child.  This one features activity so horrific and scandalous that Marilyn Manson and the court of Caligula would blush with shame.  But, hey, it helps to have a wide open definition of &quot;family film.&quot;  <br />So break out the popcorn and gather your loved ones around the television set.  Granny and little Tommy will be in therapy for decades over this one.  The scenes of coprophagia remind me why the remote was equipped with a slo-mo button!
B00003CX95|1.0|Some times I feel that Hollywood should stay away form European history altogether.The movie is  so boring and so hollywood. It did not impress me,and did not decerve any oscars.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I yield to no man in my admiration for Sarah McLachlan. She has one of the most lovely and soothing voices out there, yet on this latest release she shows absolutely no signs of musical growth over the past few years - during which she married her drummer, Ashwin Sood, and gave birth to a daughter. <br />One can hardly begrudge Sarah her newfound domestic bliss (after all, she had worked pretty damn hard in the past few years on organizing and running Lilith Fair), yet I can't help but wish she had taken a cue from an artist like Everything But the Girl, who abandoned their soft folk-rock sound after DJ Todd Terry produced a smashing remix of their song &quot;Missing&quot; that became an international dance club hit. <br />Like EBTG, Sarah has had a number of her tunes turned into interesting electronic remixes by other artists (I'm thinking of Delerium's &quot;Silence,&quot; which appears on nearly every chillout compilation in the universe, and William Orbit's intriguing take on &quot;Black&quot;). These should have suggested to Sarah a new and more challenging path down which to take her music.<BR> Instead, &quot;Fallen&quot; contains some of her least ambitious music to date. That's too bad, in my opinion, because with that gorgeous voice there's little she could not do. Maybe in another year or two she will be ready to branch out in a new direction.<br />In the meantime, this disc is still a must for true Sarah fans (of which I'm one). Just don't expect to be blown away after waiting so long.
B0000CFW87|5.0|In this album, I think this guy have  done a very great job on his entire career, I believe he's working harder then the first album and also a great things that David foster still beside him...<BR>compare to the first album, His singing technique improve tremendously. His &quot;macho&quot; voice sounds so deferent and can reach a very high notes with good vibration on few songs like &quot;you raise me up&quot;,&quot; my confession&quot;,&quot;All'imprevviso amore&quot;<BR>What I like the most is &quot;Caruso&quot;, I've been listening for so many version of Caruso and never thought that he can sing in a deferent way with his classical twist!!<BR>I can say this album is the best album of the year,<BR>Great job Josh, you did it!!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|_Train of Thought_ is by no means amazing; in fact, I consider this to be quite below standard for Dream Theater... more-so, half of it sounds like Metallica!<br />One easy characterization of this album: the heaviness of _Awake_ and the mediocrity/ radio-friendliness of _Falling into Infinity_ combined into one blisteringly heavy, catchy, work of not-so-greatness.  First off, Labrie suddenly decides that it would be \\"kewl\\" to sound like James Hetfield; I certainly didn't \\"take him as himself\\", per se.  His vocal performance pretty much does nothing for the album.  Petrucci, also, seems to have been thinking on the same level as Labrie; he downgrades his 7-string playing such that it resembles the fiddling nuances of a 14-year-old Korn worshipper come shred-fan, wherein it comes to mind (whilst listening to unimaginative shred solo after solo) \\"wheeee!  I'm so fast!  Look at me!!!!!\\"  Next, Rudess.  Oh man.  The keys in this release sound like total and utter cheese; they are merely the icing atop the \\"let's write a crappy album\\" cake, as one previous reviewer put it \\"they belong in a circus\\".  Portnoy plays a lot of \\"stuff\\" as fast as possible; he apparently hasn't learned any new tricks since _Scenes_.  Finally, Myung... again, as one reviewer said, \\"the only one worth listening too\\"; he does a great job on this release, when one \\"takes the time\\" (ooooh, wonderful pun ;) ) to actually listen to the bass track.<br />Overall, this album as a whole seems like a Dream Theater sell-out, similar to \\"Falling into Infinity\\"; obviously the band needs money to produce another good, non-radio friendly album?  Stupid radio...  As of now, _Scenes_ remains the absolute best DT release; that is, unless you like _Falling_???<br />The only highlight of the album... In the Name of Good - a quality song.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of the last true rock bands.   For 12 years they've released an endless amount of music, toured extensively, and each member contributes quality songs without trying to repeat themselves or put out radio hits.  I've been following these guys since their first album, and it amazes me how dedicated they are to their beliefs, songs and their fans.  These guys really don't care what the critics have to say; they write from the heart and love to play.   Most importantly they've put out these songs for their causes and their fans, not to make a buck.  They've been releasing random B-sides and singles gradually over the years, but finally we get a compilation album.  Many of these you've heard before, but it's so rare for a band to release a double &quot;B-sides&quot; album that is worth every penny.  Songs like Hard To Imagine and Wash are as good as anything they've ever written, and even the newer outtakes like Fatal still hold up to their &quot;classic&quot; era.  There are a couple throwaway songs, but as a whole this album is very easy to listen to.  My only complaint is that the discs are too short (50-55 minutes each) and there are a lot of B-sides &amp; Christmas singles missing.  Angel, in particular, is one of my favorites.  This is more of a sampler of their non-album songs, but it's incredible that Pearl Jam at their worst are still better than today's bands at their best.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is DEFINITLY the greatest Tool album iv ever heard! EVERY singe track is great, i dont not like one track. I reccomend this cd to ANY Tool fan. I dont think Tool could have made a better album then this one. so if your looking for a great cd to buy, This is it!
B000002JR8|4.0|This album is definitley Panteras best and heaviest. Tracks like 'Strength Beyond Strength' and 'Slaughtered' prove to be the bands heaviest tracks ever. But the song 'Good friends and a bottle of pills' stands out the most to me. Its very different than anything theyve done before. There is also a great cover of Black Sabbath's 'Planet Caravan'.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|You know when you pick up a new Dream Theater album that you are in for some of the most complex and technical music ever created.  This album is technically ingenious as all Dream Theater albums are.  I am giving this album 3 stars...and this is only in comparision to the previous Dream Theater albums.  Compared to other albums in this genre, I would give this album 4.5 stars.  There is something lacking in this album...there is not as much soul and feeling behind the music...it seems cold to me.  I applaud DT for trying this new sound...as metal is my favorite genre.  There are some lyrical effects that butcher James's voice...James's natural voice is nowhere to be found on this album.  Another key component that is lacking in this album are JP's visionary solos.  We all know he can play fast...and on this album he is out to prove it.  In my opinion...these solos sound all the same...sure there are some fills in there that vary, but I think JP and JR were just going for note for note speed.  Some of the solos are so devoid of feeling.  JR is also absent (or under the heaviness) on most of the tracks besides his solos. JM seemes to be up in the mix a bit this time, however I miss his complex fills in this album.  And as for MP, well...he's MP and he ALWAYS delievers :)<br />As I said, this review is a comparision to previous Dream Theater albums...
B000005HLV|5.0|This is very well my all-time favorite album. Very heavy and dark. Attilas' vocals range from gutteral grunts and growls to haunting chants. If you are a fan of black metal, i reccomend this album above all. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is the best track on the cd, though none are bad.
B00006BTCA|3.0|I bought this album on the advice of a friend who had the nerve to say &quot;Interpol is the next Radiohead.&quot; In retrospect I should have seen the red flags within that statement - there will never be another Radiohead, period, and quite frankly that's a good thing.<br />Nevertheless, my criticism for this band does not stop at their lack of innovative, stirring music. Listen to track five, wait approx 49 seconds and start singing the Smiths: &quot;I could go out tonight, but I haven't got a thing to wear...&quot; Then slap yourself in the forehead at such blatant theft. <br />Then dig through your CD collection and put on anything by David Bowie or Nick Cave. Listen carefully, then listen to Interpol again. Slap yourself on the forehead again each time you hear an overlap. Check your forehead in the mirror after the CD winds down and ask yourself again why you ever thought Interpol would be the next Radiohead.<br />To be fair - I like this disc. It's fun, very animated, and I think Interpol has a lot of charisma. But before being handed the moon and stars, let's encourage them to bring something to the meal instead of eating off of others' plates.
B000000H66|5.0|I picked up this cd, only hearing of Death. I have to say, i was suprised by what i heard. I had expected your typical death metal. But what i found was something very different. It seems to have a progressive feel to it. All the instruments can be heard well (even the bass, which is uncommon in death metal). Ive heard people call this 'technical death metal', and i can see why. The music is seemingly very technical. The guitar solos' sound as if Chuck is tearing out is very soul and placing it on a fretboard. I will never tire of this album.  RIP Chuck Schuldiner
B000001FAK|5.0|How luck one of the other reviewrers was to have seen this concert. This is a absolute masterpiece of live blues. John mayall and all the band at there best and all sound like they are enjoying themselves. And the whole concert with no drums makes me want to listen to other cd's to see if they were really needed. The harmonica work is magically and makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. They is nothing else really to say apart this CD should be every blues fans collection. I have this on vinyl as well and recomend to vinyl fans to try and get a copy. Not sure if i should mention it but bluestorm is the place to go. So buy this CD TELL EVERY ONE TO GO OUT AND CRANK UP THE VOLUME
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Many reviews of this album have got it right--Sarah sounds downright uninspired. It's as if she doesn't quite believe what she's written. What I love about Sarah's previous work is the feeling  that she is telling me private secrets about her life. I feel like &quot;Afterglow&quot; is one big lie--I know she isn't in a suffering relationship, so those types of songs fall flat for me.<BR>    <BR>      &quot;Afterglow&quot; sounds like it could have been amazing had Sarah not experienced such trauma in her life. The first half of the album, I think is MUCH better than the second half. As a matter of fact, &quot;Fallen&quot; was completed in 2001, so that fact alone tells me that the earlier songs were finished in a creative mindset whereas the others were finished out of sheer &quot;let's get this done.&quot; <BR>    <BR>      I will say, however, that her voice is probably the most beautiful it has EVER been. But thanks to Mr. Marchand, it is buried beneath so many instruments and background vocals that it gets lost. I love Sarah's use of the cello and background enya-like vocals, but I do think that the effect gets a bit overdone at times.<BR>    <BR>      As for Sarah's lyrics, I hate to admit this (as I am a HUGE, die-hard Sarah fan), but they are definitely juvenile in comparison to her earlier work. It's &quot;Sarah-by-numbers&quot; as a reviewer pointed out before. Add &quot;reverie&quot; and &quot;unraveled,&quot; mix with background vocals, and--voila!--instant Sarah. <br />     Although it may sound like I am bashing this album, I really do like it. I have been listening to it every day; it grows on me with each listen. My favorites are &quot;Fallen,&quot; &quot;World on Fire,&quot; &quot;Stupid,&quot; &quot;Drifting,&quot; &quot;Answer&quot; and &quot;Time.&quot; I cannot stand &quot;Push&quot;--absolutely the worst song on the disc. I actually like all of the songs with the exception of &quot;Push.&quot; The best track is &quot;Time&quot; by far. Beautifulmelody, catchy chorus, good lyrics for the most part, and good singing. It kind of reminds me of a song that would be on &quot;Solace.&quot; <BR>    <BR>      Overall, I think this is worth picking up for the die-hard fan. If this is your first introduction to Sarah, I echo the other reviewers' sentiments--pick up &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; or, my recommendation, &quot;Rarities, B-sides, and Other Stuff.&quot;

B0000C6E4D|2.0|I have been listening to the album for over a week hoping to find something more but it fails to evoke the emotional response of her previous releases.  I still like some the songs but I wouldn't recommend this album to someone new to Sarah.  Get Fumbling instead.
B000089RVX|5.0|I want you to shut the hell up whoever says evanescence sucks. I like them, and after reading this if you don't already you will.<br />First of all, my idea of a band is any genre (excluding rap and hip-hop), with an actual melody. Not like Dido which is a whole bunch of drum beats layed together to be put into a song. Not Britney or Madonna, they are just weird. Dancing around a stage making an ass of themself to get attention and kissing disgustingly thinking they're so sexy is not a way to be good.<br />Now with Evanescence, they are melody people. They put in effort to please people, so respect that! If you are saying that crap like 50 Cent is good and not Evanescence, you are just irregular.<br />A lot of people say Evanescence is like Linkin Park with a chick in it. Yeah, I'm one of those people. I like Linkin Park a lot and they're #2 on my fav list, but they do kiss Evanescence's ass. <br />Now with the songs.... they do kick ass, but nobody said they could improve at all. I'll use Tourniquet as an example. It has a great hollow melody, Amy's voice is awesome, but the lyrics are somewhat strange. Good enough though to earn a 8.5 out of 10.<br />Some songs I have listed as higher than 10, even though 10 is the limit. Some songs I think are just so much of what I call music, the song would deserve at least a 10.5.<br />Now this is what I think of the songs:<br />Going Under: 10.5/10 (Like I said)<BR>Going Under should be a role model for every other band. It's dark and pretty, yet it's \\"I-I-I-I-'m dying again\\" that line was the most beautiful lyric, but it's a little bit screechy. It's very creative and has meaning. I think that it's about many options to take so there are too many thoughts about which one is true and about dishonest people.<br />Bring Me To Life: 9.5/10<BR>Gets old after awhile, but it is still a great song. It's about how people are living a normal life (as opposed to I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems)and they don't know what's really going on outside of all this, and how boring life is. Beautiful song.<br />Everybody's fool: 9/10<BR>This song is my sixth favorite, so its not exactly my cup of tea, but it's not the worst song. It's my favorite on the album to sing though because it is catchy. Not exactly beautiful, but interesting.<br />My Immortal: 9/10<BR>I don't exactly understand what the deal is with this song. Yes, it is the most popular and it is the best video as a solemn moment stretched for 4 minutes, it's a little too anthem-y. Too depressing.<br />Haunted: 7/10<BR>Least favorite. I really hate this song. It's annoying so I don't know why people like it. If I had a Halloween party this would be the first song I play because it's considered scary to me. Should be theme to Psycho if it weren't so old.<br />Tourniquet: 8.5/10<BR>Like I said before, it is a beautiful hollow song and Amy's voice is great and all, but the lyrics weird me out. Not my favorite, but it is a great song.<br />Imaginary: 11/10<BR>This is my second favorite song. Lyrics are mellow and calm, and I'm in my field of paper flowers! Just kidding. Beautiful song expressing imagination, strong words, and powerful competition for my favorite. Haven't won yet.<br />Taking Over Me: 9.5/10<BR>I like it, it is in my top 5, but it could use a little editing. Not much to say really. The song is very expressing but overwhelming. Good job.<br />Hello: 7/10<BR>I don't like this song either. It could really make me cry. It is by far the most depressing song on the album. It makes me think of the song in comparison to something like \\"Me Against The Music\\" because it is actually close, but in a depressing way. I would never really like to hear it again. <br />My Last Breath: 7.5/10<BR>It is not the best song. I only really like the intro. Too mushy for me. That's really all I have to say.<br />Well, if Going Under, Bring Me To Life, Imaginary, and Taking Over me are in the top 5, and there's nothing better than Imaginary so far,then my favorite must be...<br />Whisper: 12/10<BR>This is my favorite on the album by far. It's tune is very catchy and the lyrics are beautiful. It has the most get-the-message-I'm-dying kind of thing. It is a little off with the ending though, but it competes the song. Great effort, and good for you Evanescence.<br />I hope that you'll take my advice and read this thoroughly so you can understand how good Evanescence is. I advise you listen to the songs before you buy on Evanescence.com. Duh I recommend it.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|What an absolutely breathtaking soundtrack for an absolutely wondrerful movie. <br />There is not a single track you will want to skip!  <br />How ironic it is, that I would have to rate the songs on the CD almost in the order they appear on the soundtrack (with the exception of moving Dido's song down a couple of notches along with the Norah Jones song)<br />The Kelly Clarkson Song, Maroon5 song, and Wyclef Jean songs are all outstanding tracks on a totally awesome album.  <br />The Trouble With Love Is will have you wistfully remembering your many favorite scenes from the movie as well as touching your heart. You'll find yourself unable to not sing along.  <br />Sweetest Goodbye/Sunday morning shows a totally other side of Maroon5 then what you are familiar with on radio.  It will have you moving in your seat and again, singing along.<br />Take me as I am is just a totally fun raggae type song that just fits the movie so well.  <br />Where you don't have to see this movie to enjoy the soundtrack, It certainly does heighten the listening pleasure. <br />See the movie, buy the soundtrack!  Both are a must have experience!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|This is the latest in a long line of quality records from DT, but there seems to be something missing this time around...the songs just aren't quite there, there's nothing that really reaches out and grabs you. The brilliance of records like SFAM and 6DOIT is that they feature lots of over-the-top technical playing without sacrificing memorable songs...this album has the technical prowess, but the engaging songs, the solos that are burned in your brain note-for-note after just a few listens, are sadly missing. A good album, but a definite step down from the brilliant records they've made in the past...DT have set very high standards for themselves, and they don't quite live up to them this time.
B00000J7S8|5.0|With music being such trash nowadays(Britney and J. Lo are good examples), Diana Krall is easily one of the most talented and gifted artists out there. Her smokey and soulful voice is reminiscent of the great jazz legends. This album, in particular, is her best. Each and every track is just amazing. I never listened to jazz prior to Diana but my brother introduced me to her and I have never looked back. If you don't like this album then you don't like music.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|After listening some more to this album, I realize that &quot;Fallen&quot; is the only song that sort-of measures up to the previous standards, but even so, the chorus is filled with trite lyrics that frankly sound embarassing! I'm shocked that Sarah allowed Marchand to bury her voice underneath all that Wall-of-Sound effects, since her voice is as good as ever. The biggest problem of course is no edge in the songs, trite lyrics. Fumbling was devastating album, Surfacing a bit less so but still had punch.<br />Afterglow is simply product, nothing else.
B000002UY5|5.0|i COULD LISTEN TO THIS CD A HUNDRED TIMES IN A ROW AND NOT GET SICK OF IT. nO MATTER WHAT YOU LIKE BLIND MELON HAS IT. i GOT THE CD 4 YEARS AGO AND I STILL LISTEN TO IT ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT IS AMAZING HOW THE BAND BLENDS SO MANY SONGS TOGETHER TO FORM A REALLY MELLOW SONG OR A ROCKING JAM BEAT. BUY THIS CD.
B00003Q43A|5.0|This movie took an old idea of alien invasion and updated it flawlessly. It also includes pop culture UFO references. I hope Independence Day 2 gets made.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|It's better than anything else out there these days...I see it as her least depressing album, it's kind of nice and uplifting in a way, not as emotionally heavy as previous work, not as much personality in the songs. Still I will listen to it more than Surfacing, and album that I find to be truly depressing. <BR>The best will always be Fumbling, followed by Solace, where her raw talent appears in pristine form.
B00198X0VS|3.0|Frank the Pug is featured too prominently and there are too many then-contemporary references to pop culture, which takes away from the humor. I wish they would have kept the uniforms from the end of the second movie for continuity's sake. But it's still a funny, enjoyable movie.
B00006690G|4.0|Yes. This isn't his best album -- but it's not because he sold out or the fame got to him. It's simply his natural progression as an artist.<BR>   The Marshall Mathers LP exuded raw energy, and the real meaning of his lyrics was hidden behind so many (predominantly false) tales of criminal action and derangement that few could see the message. <BR>   But on this album, Eminem tells the story straight. There're very few exagerrations or overuse of surrealism here. This, of course, lowers the album's artistic value yet seems necessary after its caustic predecessor. <BR>   It was 2Pac's third solo offering (\\"Me Against The World) that revealed his sensitive side, via \\"Dear Mama\\", and it was also the third for Eminem (ignoring his pre-mainstream work before \\"The Slim Shady LP\\"). Entering the rap industry as the first widely-publicized white rapper since Vanilla Ice was not easy. Eminem had to prove himself, and he did so with harsh, unapologetic lyrics. Most rappers had to start out strong and could only later show feeling, but Eminem had to ... but to a greater degree. <BR>   And this is the product of no longer having anything to prove. It's honest and surprisingly not-so controversial. Few homosexual or hippie protestors will go against a man that most-likely loves his offspring more than they do ( ... of course this doesn't apply to the non-adopting homosexuals). <BR>   You just can't argue with the morals displayed on this CD. He lays it all out for the world -- but at the price of artistry.<BR>   Hopefully this won't be the last great Eminem album.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I'd probably give it 5 stars if Jar Jar Binks wasn't around so much. But it's still an integral part of the Star Wars saga.
B00005RY7X|5.0|-I have never actually listened to the entire album, so one might debate I am unqualified to write a review on it.  HOWEVER, I did see Andrew WK perform with Hoobastank at Ziggys Club last night, and it was the best, most insane show I have ever been to in my entire life.   His songs are so full of energy and charge fowards without stopping for anyone or anything.  Anyone who thinks that this guy is just a sellout, and wants nothing more than our money is DEAD WRONG.  Watching him and his band mates up on stage, I did not get the impression that they thought that performing was a chore.  Quite the contrary, they looked like 6 friends jamming together and having a great time. All he's doing is having fun making freakin amazing music, and helping us all have our own fun. He didn't care what the crowd did, he encouraged us to mosh,let people up on the stage with him, crowd surfed, the works.  His message is simple: \\"Have fun, rejoice in life, because youre lucky to be alive.  Take pleasure in the fun things you can do because theyre all you have, and soon youll be dead anyway\\"  <BR>-Alot of people have said they feel sorry for anyone who takes this CD and these songs seriosuly, but they're not meant to be take seriosuly.  These aren't biting political anthems or woe is me angst rock songs, theyre songs about getting drunk, chicks, and getting drunk some more. I feel sorry for anyone who things they hafta take this CD seriously, just have fun with it.<BR>-Just from seeing him live I strongly recommend this CD to everyone, the tracks I have listened to capture the essence of his live performances perfectly.  And last but not least GO SEE ANDREW WK LIVE!!! You will not regret it.
B00008PW2D|1.0|It's a sad shame that I wont be buying the fifth season of this great show and all because of the ridiculous price.I cant believe they expect us to pay the same price when we only get about half as much content.Do they really think that we are mindless consumers who will pay anything for our favorite shows?The season itself was pretty good but it's too bad it was cut short.I would advise anyone to not purchase this set until they lower the price that way they will be forced to lower the price if no one is purchasing it.SAD SAD SAD!!!
B0000C0FJB|5.0|My take on this CD is this:<br />I agree on the slight degraded quality of the sound.  There is a reason for that.  As it said in the CD jacket, they had an older recording truck.  Alex and co had to go in the studio and clean it up as much as possible for release...<br />But...I really like this CD because of several things.<BR>1.  Set list...They played many of the best songs they've done.<BR>2.  The musicianship they exhibited was absolutely phenomenal.  I also have the DVD Music Video (I also recommend this too).  I was quite thrilled to finally receive this after 5 years of waiting.<br />3.  Alex'es goofiness (as usual)  He is hilarious in this...That part in La Villia Strantagio was worth the cost of the cD!<br />4.  Finally, they let everyone know in the world that they're back with a vengence and...<br />&quot;That's How It Is&quot;.....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the first show to come along in a long time that really captured my interest and held it.  I was extremely disappointed when it was cancelled.  And that's putting it mildly.  The acting was superb and the show was intense, funny, or scary depending on the episode.  Anyone who knocks the special effects either didn't watch the show or didn't pay attention.  I'm not saying Firefly is for everyone, but the special effects were more realistic and better than any I've seen on tv in a long while.  Buy the dvd and you won't be disappointed.
1563898586|4.0|Alan Moore successfully integrates characters from different Victorian novels making them analogous to modern day superheroes. This is a very intriguing idea.<br />Moore himself is an excellent writer who knows Victorian literature very well. His love for it is obvious in every page and in every small sly reference. Combining all of these different characters--most who were not necessarily heroes in their novels--he comes up with a fresh way of approaching the superhero genre.<br />Don't let the movie fool you. The comic is dark and intelligent. A comic truly for adults and written at an adult level. If anyone can eventually convince the world that comics are a legitimate form of literature it would be Alan Moore. I would certainly buy the Second Volume if it is released.<br />My only complaints are that the artwork doesn't live up to the writing. In fact, it many times takes away from the story. <br />That and whenever Chinese writing is used it is the modern simplified characters created by the Communists in the latter half of the 20th century rather than the traditional ones still in use outside of Mainland China.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is probably my favorite CD that I bought this year.  Norah's voice is amazing and has a very soothing quality to it. This is the CD I put in my CD player when I come home from a long day.  It's very relaxing.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because some of the songs do sound a like.  But overall, this is a great CD to own.  I never get tired of listening to the songs over and over again.
B00005QCVY|4.0|Summary:<BR>George Bailey (James Stewart) is a hometown boy with big aspirations.  After finishing high school, he is going to tour Europe then go to college and become a big name architect and construction job manager, building huge dams and great projects.  Everything seems to be headed that way, too, until his father, Peter Bailey (Samuel S. Hinds), has a stroke and ends up dying.  His father was the head of the local Savings and Loan and without his guidance, the vile Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the town miser, plans on a forced takeover of the Savings and Loan, much to George's Uncle Billy's (Thomas Mitchell) wishes (and to the detriment of the town's poor).  <br />The only way to save the Savings and Loan is for George, whom everyone respects and trusts, to step in as the new chairman and takeover.  Giving up his tour of Europe and college education, George does the 'right' thing, and takes over the Savings and Loan, which is really the only thing standing between the poor of the town having a chance to live decent lives and Mr. Potter taking over everything and grinding them into the mud.  <br />In giving up his college dreams, George has to watch while his younger brother, Harry (Todd Karns), uses his money to go to college, becomes a football star, then a war hero.  George also watches his new found love, Mary (Donna Reed), go off to school.  All of this turns George bitter, but he presses on, despite the problems.  Eventually one good thing does happen, Mary comes back, and despite his bitterness towards his lost opportunities, George marries Mary and they make a life together as the advocates of the town's poor. <br />George, who helps the poor despite it hurting the Savings and Loan and keeping him perpetually poor, eventually runs into trouble.  His forgetful uncle, Billy, loses an $8,000 deposit on Christmas Eve, just when the local auditor comes to check over their books.  Without that money, George and Billy are bound to go to jail.  As it turns out, Mr. Potter is the one who found it, but because he wants to crush them out of business, he doesn't give them the money.<br />For George, this is the last straw.  Knowing his life is ruined, he finally breaks down and is mean to people, starting with his Uncle, but moving to his wife, kids, their schoolteachers, and, well, pretty much everyone.  Until his guardian angel happens upon the scene, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers).  Clarence appears just in time to stop George from killing himself then helps him to see all of the good that he has done for the people of the town and how much they need him.  Once George realizes this, he can't wait to get back home, despite the impending jail sentence.<br />But when he returns home, even though the police and the auditor are waiting for him, he finds that his incredible wife has brought the townspeople together and they are going to bail him out.  Thus ends a touching tale about how kindness can make you much wealthier in terms of relationships than can money.<br />My Comments:<BR>Believe it or not, I had never seen this movie, despite it supposedly being a classic Christmas film.  I was a bit hesitant, because I tend to enjoy psychological thrillers much more than sappy dramas, but I ended up appreciating this movie.  However, my appreciation went much further than what I would consider the superficial heroics of George Bailey, who saved his younger brother and was nice to people.  It was also deeper than the townspeople coming together in the end to save George and the Savings and Loan.  What I really liked about this movie was the communism.  Yep, that's right, this is pure communist propaganda and I loved every second of it.  But before I get into that, let me talk about the story and the acting.<br />The story is pretty straightforward.  It does cover quite a bit of time, but does so well and convincingly.  There aren't any major plot holes and the only kind of quirky thing is the intervention of the guardian angel.  For most people, the divine intervention is probably one of the best parts of the film.  As an agnostic, I recognized that many people probably enjoyed this notion, but it was really just a necessary tool to illustrate to George what life would have been like had he not been born.  And, yes, the portrayal of George's town without him was a bit extreme, and the idea of someone not being born wasn't particularly well-fleshed out (though this is a drama and not a science fiction thriller).  But overall, it's a sound story that hits all the right marks to jerk a tear.<br />The acting is also good.  There are some weaker links, like Thomas Mitchell and some of the other peripheral characters, but the main actors, Stewart and Reed, were really very good.  (Oh, and Donna Reed, am I the only one that thinks she's attractive?  I never thought I'd hear myself say that about Donna Reed...)  Anyway, I can't really complain about the acting.  It was really good for its time and pretty good for today.<br />Now, back to communism.  Yes, this movie is about communism, but not Soviet or Chinese communism.  This is essentially a boiled down version of Marxist communism, where the people own everything. It also is a brilliant depiction of the exploitation of the working classes by the bourgeoisie, in this case Mr. Potter.  George's attempts to help the poor and maintain the Savings and Loan are Capra's way of defeating capitalist exploitation.  Hooray for the little man!  Three cheers for labor unions!   If Frank Capra was just trying to tell a story and was not trying to criticize capitalism, then I'm a double-headed pig that can use a computer.<br />Overall, this is a very good film.  It is well-produced, convincing (except for the whole guardian angel/talking in space thing), and the acting is good.  But what's more, it has an anti-capitalist message.  I can't say it was perfect, but it was touching and inspirational.  If only we could take out the religion stuff, I'd say we have a rallying cry for social democracy (okay, leave in the religion for now, but eventually...).  Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, yes, it's sappy, but it's also heart-warming (and Donna Reed's cute).  You should definitely check it (and her) out.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Personally, I think you'll either love or hate this movie.  There is no in between.  When I watched this movie, I couldn't stand it, yet I keep telling people to watch it because I cant.. Even describe it.  <BR>And it freaked me out.<BR>STILL freaks me out.  <BR>::Shiver::
B0000E2FLC|4.0|... THE AUDIO HAS BEEN ALTERED. THIS IS NOT AC/DC LIVE, ITS AC/DC REDUBBED. THE NICE PART IS THAT IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC!! THE AUDIO IS DARN NEAR PERFECT.  HOWEVER, THE VIDEO QUALITY IS VHS AT BEST, THE BLACKS LOOK GREY AND WORN. WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT FROM A 1991 CONCERT? SOME REMASTERING WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE. IT TAKES A FEW SONGS TO GET USED TO IT AFTER WATCHING OTHER DVD'S, BUT DOESNT DETRACT TOO MUCH FROM THE EXPERIENCE.  THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD IS THE FACT THAT YOU GET SOME SONGS YOU CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE (ON DVD), SUCH AS \\"FIRE YOUR GUNS\\" AND \\"HELL AIN'T A BAD PLACE\\". ...  ANOTHER COOL THING ABOUT THIS DVD IS THE AUDIO COMMENTARY, YOU JUST DON'T FIND THAT WITH TOO MANY CONCERT DVD'S. ALSO, YOU CAN WATCH ONE SINGLE MEMBER OF THE BAND FOR SOME SONGS, WHICH IS COOL CUZ I LIKE SEEING ANGUS YOUNG PLAY BACK IN BLACK.  ANYHOW, THIS DVD IS WORTH THE PRICE, ...  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. ROCK ON!!
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|Vulgar, stupid, not funny, and lot of toilet humor. Overall: GARBAGE.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This may be work for us alone.  Who 'em us anyway?  Well, if you recognize those words, you know.  Not unlike the concept albums of early Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Grace Slick's &quot;Manhole&quot;, and others; this is a story set to music...to be told.  The long extended sets in the middle and towards the end are reason enough to lay down, relax and listen to Neil.  The music is more fun than it has to be, and the story, well...it is topical, relevent and now.  That this contains a DVD of his presentation across the pond makes it even more worthwhile and explains the minds end, visual.  So, you won't hear it on the radio, so be it.  It ain't for them.  It's for us.  I give it five stars, it may deserve only four,<BR>some may display three, others only two, however even my cats curl up with me to listen to the story of Granddad, Carmichael,<BR>and the F.B.I and their damn Helecopters.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|This album, while not as powerful as her previous 2 releases, is still Sarah and as such is haunting and emotional.  Sarah's voice is in fine form, but lyricaly not as strong. If you are new to Sarah you'd probably be happier with Fumbling as a first go round.
B000002VJH|5.0|The Grateful Dead are not known for their studio work, this album however stands out as one of the few shining jewels in the Dead's studio recording. these Spacier songs which really came alive on the stage are presented in interesting, slower versions on the album. The listener is able to pick apart subtle guitar licks and phrases in Help-&gt;slip. Also, Crazy fingers is Clutch! this track gives me chills every time I listen to it. sure a lot of the same songs are also available on &quot;One from the Vault&quot;, however was made the Dead great was the fact that no two recordings are alike, to the keen listener, their are subtle differences to be appreciated in both albums.
0316921173|4.0|My title lies.  This book didn't stay with me -- it has traveled to many of my friends who wanted to read it for themselves.  I think that it's currently somewhere in the South Pacific. I finished this book at least four years ago, and I still complain about it.  This causes my friends to borrow it.  Why? <br />My chief complaint:  I actually liked this book, maybe even loved it.  <br />I really wanted to hate it.  I really hated lugging it on the subway to read.  I hated breaking a sweat if I carried it anywhere during those summer months.  I hated everyone who stopped me as I read and said, &quot;Infinite Jest... I started that, but it's too long to finish.  What page are you on?&quot;  I hated the tiny print, the endnotes (don't skip them), and the two bookmarks. <br />But the book itself was worth it.  It is a book that you want to buy.  I won't give you a plot overview because an overview of a book of this length is a bit silly and I can't do better than what has already been done.  Also, I believe that you should take your time and read the book -- be naive and don't skip ahead.  Good books of this length should be savored. <br />What I will do is predict that, eventually, you will want to read Infinite Jest again.  I still remember the characters in that book better than some of the men I dated. While I may be trying to forget those men, I am now readying myself for the second reading of Infiinte Jest because certain aspects are getting hazy -- and this is one book deserving so much more than that.

6303461484|5.0|Two things induced me to watch this film. One was that it intrigued me how serial killers can get away with it for so long. Britain's own most steadfast practitioner, the final count of whose victims, correct to the nearest hundred, has still to be determined, was the chairman of the parent/teacher association at the school my children attended, stepping down from his post the year before my elder first went there, so the issue was to that extent rather close to home. Britain, I thought, was one thing - we have been short of police for quite a while. The Soviet Union, I thought, was surely quite another. Whatever its shortcomings, I never heard of lack of police being one of them. My other motivator was to try to get a feel for how the investigation and prosecution was conducted in a totalitarian state. My belief in democracy is unwavering, but where public interest is aroused it is getting more and more difficult to understand how an impartial jury can be assembled. Less of a problem where news is subject to official control, I imagined.<br />The first thing I commend about this film is that it does not try to keep fighting the cold war. There are no heavy lessons in the virtues of Freedom and Democracy. The parties involved, even regrettably the killer Chikitilo himself, were ordinary sorts of people behaving much as one might expect in any stable society. We get a reminder of where all this is going on when Stephen Rea as the reluctant but dogged investigator expresses anxiety to his wife that he could be called for in the small hours, but the film sticks to its brief of telling a story rather than preaching or philosophising. The story is horrific indeed, but there are no gratuitous cheap tricks or effects, not even in my opinion the memorable shot of Chikitilo after the murder of the child by the railway line. Chikitilo is a very unremarkable shabby balding little man with glasses carrying a brown bag around. The inclusion of Donald Sutherland (as the senior army officer) always recommends any film to me, but it is Joss Acland as the fanatical-eyed party boss who steals the show.<br />Now having seen the film, I don't think I'm really a lot clearer how the offender managed to continue offending for so long. He had been arrested on suspicion, questioned and released years before he was finally nailed. One scientist has advanced a theory that he had blood and semen of different types, a theory I have never heard of since. The film ends with the killer's execution, and the unresolved puzzles are briefly summarised in a text footnote before the final credits. This does not purport to be any `great' film, but it is admirably clear about what it is trying to do, which is to tell a story of obvious interest in its own right, but also, sadly, a story of a type that is far too familiar and that leaves too many questions unanswered. Rating it simply for what it sets out to be and do, I would call it a 5-star product.my officer) always recommends any film to me, but it is Joss Acland as the fanatical-eyed party boss who steals the show.<br />Now having seen the film, I don't think I'm really a lot clearer how the offender managed to continue offending for so long.

B00005UEAR|4.0|When I first heard Disc 1 of Six Degrees, I admit I was disappointed. Their previous album, Scenes From A Memory, was incredible, and their absolute best. On this nothing seemed to really gel, and Jordan Rudess didn't seem as integral a part of the sound as he did on SFAM. However, this is definately a record that grows on you. With this, Dream Theater progressed. Progression doesn't equal time signatures and blazing 32-note runs. Progression means the band changes, hopefully for the better, from disc to disc. While SFAM was the group at its most complex, Six Degrees focused more on tight songwriting and a healty dose of experimentation. &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; roars out of the gate like early Metallica or the lost demo from Awake. Although Mike's &quot;singing&quot; threatens to blow it all to hell, it is saved by high energy, a good performance by James and Myung, and Jordan's hilarious &quot;turntable&quot; solo. &quot;Blind Faith&quot; took me a while to get into. More of an alternative rock song with some intelligent lyrics, it also has a badass solo section. I particularly love the intro. &quot;Misunderstood&quot; shows that DT is trying out some new things. It's it's use of acoustic guitar, vocal harmonies, and cello, of all things, give it an ominous feel, yet it still contains those majestic chord progressions that are something of a DT trademark. &quot;The Great Debate&quot; is a decent heavy song, but it has nowhere near the energy of &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; and tries a little too hard to sound like Tool. The lyrics deal with stem cell research, and although they cover both sides of the debate, you can pretty much tell that Petrucci is against the research. Although the lyrics are hit and miss, it is interesting to see Dream Theater get political. &quot;Disappear&quot; is probably my personal favorite. It's extremely melancholy, eerie, morbid, and VERY experimental. Sounds kinda like a cross between a film score and Mr. Bungle. I could seriouslysee this tune playing at the end of some bizarre science fiction movie. All in all, I am impressed by the songcraft DT shows off here, as opposed to masturbating on their instruments. Although not quite in the same league as SFAM, Awake, or Images &amp; Words, Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence remains a fine addition to the Dream Theater discography.<br />Oh, and the second disc isn't bad either...
0783229011|5.0|Please disregard the statement below that reads (and I quote): &quot;pigs are not well like for good reasons&quot;. I dare call that person a pompous jerk. Pigs are great for a million reasons and Babe, as a cinematic art, strives to show that. Who sings &quot;la la la la la&quot; to the animals? Who talks to the sheep? Who saves the day when the farmer is down on his luck? The answer to all of these is Babe, a pig. The hero pig of this movie. I ask Mr. Pigs aren't great, what would you do if I pig offered a hoof to help you out? Walk on you say? I think not. I think not. <BR>In conclusion, pigs are great and this movie shows how great they are.

Tolkien's literary masterpiece, which has been widely agknowledged as one of the greatest pieces of literature of all time, couldn't be made into a film.  It was.<br />It was said that any movie so good would need a DVD to match.  And there is.  This film, one of the best ever made, has made its seemless transition to the small screen.  Though the film has obviously lost some of its sweeping grandeur, it is no less perfect when viewed at home - if not more so, because it is easier to appreciate such great art with others that you know.<br />The picture quality here is amazing, and the sound design is brilliant, especially if you have a surround sound system.  It sounds as though you're actually in a movie theater.<br />This is a DVD worth the money, even if you're not a fan of the book or movies.  When the Extended Edition DVD comes out, I'll be buying that one too.
B00005JMFR|1.0|saw this movie today, i must say it is like a B sci fi flick with a huge budget.<br />i'm not sure where all the philosophy talk in this movie fits in but it seems wholey unnecessary.  the talk with the indian family was droll and didn't seem to serve much purpose in the movie.  maybe if any character in this movie delivered any line with any amount of personality and conviction it wouldn't matter.  the characters couldn't make me care about anything,  except when agent smith expressed his disgust for humans, that was awesome when he said(in not so many words..):\\"anything this weak was meant to die.\\"  that was sweet. he was probably the only actor that 'acted'.  if a scene was enjoyable it was because he was in it.  it's frustrating watching keanu because his performance is void of character.<br />there are some action scenes throughout the first half or so of the movie.  they're there.<br />there's a 'war' scene, and the swirling sentinels provide nice visuals.  this gives you a nice break from over wrought dialogue.  <br />people keep talking to the oracle, why i don't know.  <br />the movie eventually lumbers along to the climax with neo and agent smith.  thank god agent smith is in this movie.  that is probably the most enjoyable part of the movie.  nice effects, choreography lifted straight from any dragon ball cartoon.  this was pretty cool..<br />and then there's an ending with more dialogue, confound it all.  i was hoping this movie would be good like the first, but it takes itself way too seriously and really just isn't that good.  you want it to rule but it doesn't... like a guy said here, you could probably edit matrix 2 and 3 to be one movie.  that would be nice.  but as it stands, this is more like a B Sci Fi movie with a huge budget.  if you enjoy cheesy sci fi, this is good for a laugh.
B00000J2PH|5.0|OK, I've finally gotten around to reviewing one of the most popular albums of all-time.  I've had this for a while but... Definitely Carole King's masterpiece, the thoughtful, comforting, inspiring, and richly-woven Tapestry shows not only her songwriting powers at their best, but proves she was able to turn out inspiring tunes for herself instead of sundry others as she did in the 1960's.  She even does a few of those songs here as well.  And behold the result.  Tapestry yielded no less than four Grammy Awards for 1971:  Album of the Year, Record of the Year for \\"It's Too Late\\", Song of the Year for \\"You've Got A Friend\\", and Pop Female Vocal.  But I see in Tapestry, with its jamming piano and rolling rhythm a template for the sound of the 70's that influenced countless others, such as the Eagles, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, and Karla Bonoff.<br /> That familiar jamming keyboard starting off \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" whose catchy rhythm will make one feel \\"as mellow as the month of May\\" if it catches one in the right frame of mind, of course.  It maintains an upbeat jamming until the song's end, when the tempo gradually winds down.  Martika and more recently Mandy Moore are at least two artists who have covered this song.<br />\\"So Far Away\\" is a slow, thoughtful, introspective song, well, \\"one more song about the highway\\" asking \\"doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?\\"  Carole is on piano, and her friend James Taylor on guitar.<br />Then comes the Grammy-winner \\"It's Too Late\\" which is basically about how two people tried, but \\"something inside has died,\\" and all from being \\"light and breezy\\" down to \\"look[ing] so unhappy.\\"  The key here is that something inside happened to one of the party, \\"or maybe we've just both stopped trying.\\"  Gloria Estefan covered this on her cover songs album, Hold Me Thrill Me.<br />One of my favourites here is \\"Home Again,\\" about wanting to return home and having someone to talk to after being on the road.  If Carole King was my psychiatrist, she'd give me an F for not following the mindset adopted in \\"Beautiful.\\"  She's clearly wondered why people are always sad but she believes that one is as beautiful as one feels.  In that case, I'm ugly down to the bone at times.  However, she comes up with an answer:  \\"maybe love can end the madness/maybe not, oh, but we can only try.\\"  I'm still skeptical at her belief that a smile will get people to treat you better.<br />\\"Way Over Yonder\\" is a search for a true utopia without troubles, a place of \\"the sweet tasting good life.\\"  The sun shining down is nice, with the rivers of honey having some biblical connotations.  \\"A garden of wisdom from long ago dream\\", huh?  When's the next train?<br />The universally ever-inspiring \\"You've Got A Friend\\" would definitely have a place in my top 100 songs.  This came out the same year as James Taylor's version.  Apart from Carole's piano and Taylor's guitar, there's  an accompanying string quartet.  Ofra Haza did a cover of this on her last album but it didn't top this rendition.  The words of the chorus are immortal, but my mind latches on to this particular verse:  \\"Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend/when people can be so cold/they'll hurt you and desert you/and take your soul if you let them/oh, but don't you let them.\\"<br />\\"Where you lead I will follow\\" goes the chorus on \\"Where You Lead\\" on this nice number on emotional fealty.  Simple but comforting lyrics.<br />The oft-covered \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\", originally done by the Shirelles, is done in a mellowed piano ballad, again with help on guitar by James Taylor, without the polish and extra sugar of the original.<br />The most uptempo song here is \\"Smackwater Jack\\" of someone who loses his head and shoots down the people in a church, only to be captured by a posse, but is hung instead of being brought to trial.  While I note her belief in law and order and the injustice of justice without trial, I wonder if King embodies more traditionalvalues.  What would today's society think of \\"You can't talk to a man with a shotgun in his hand?\\"  And if one thinks about it, isn't that the mentality which the US had in Iraq last March?  The live version, one of two bonus tracks for the remaster, isn't bad.<br />It's only Carole here on piano with the title track, where she uses a tapestry as a metaphor for her life and that of a man of fortune whose ups and downs she sees in that tapestry.  There's a degree of sadness when the tapestry unravels, just as the song starts to end.  She does her own take of \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\", making it less brassy than Aretha Franklin's rendition.<br />With a sound that matches the rest of Tapestry, the bonus song \\"Out In The Cold\\" is a nice afterthought which doesn't spoil an album that's one of the most popular of all time.lues.

B0000CC61G|5.0|It was only a matter of time before a band like nglagrd came around. The 1980s and the early 1990s were obviously prog rock's lean years. While some welcomed the neo-prog scene (Marillion, IQ, Pendragon, etc.), others were less than happy with the scene, accusing them as being little else than a pale, modernized update of the Gabriel-era Genesis sound. And then there's Genesis, who spent the 1980s releasing ever more commercial albums culminating with Invisible Touch (which at that point sounded pretty indistinguishable from Phil Collins' solo career, particularly No Jacket Required), and pretty much sticking in that same territory with We Can't Dance. And of course, from 1979 to 1992, you had punk rock and disco give way to new wave. And then new wave eventually gave way to the grunge/alternative rock scene (lead by Kurt Cobain and Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, etc.), which seemed even less encouraging in the world of prog. And then nglagrd came around, picking up where the 1970s left off, and releasing Hybris near the end of 1992. The album was originally released on CD on the Mellotronen label in Sweden, and on LP on the long-defunct Colours label out of Norway. I happen to own the LP, which came with a booklet that had the lyrics to all the songs, and many black and white photos of the various band members. What's really surprising is you might think the band would consist of a bunch of thirty to forty-something musicians who would have been there in the '70s to witness and participate in the rise of prog rock, but not at all. The ages of the band members were from 17 (drummer Mattias Olsson) to 24 (guitarist/vocalist Tord Lindman), but they play like they were there in the 70s! Aside from Olsson and Lindman, the other members were guitarist Jonas Engdegrd, keyboardist Thomas Johnson, flautist Anna Holmgren, and bassist Johan Hgberg. And while everyone else in '92 were all too happy to use lots of digital synthesizers and drum machines, the members ofnglagrd went for a totally analog approach. Real drums, and even so much as using a Hammond organ and Mellotron, but never a DX-7. The combination of electric and acoustic instruments was certainly welcomed, since the combination of instruments fell out of favor by the late '70s. And what was great was nglagrd's music was inspired by many of the prog greats: King Crimson, Genesis, Yes, and there's often a Nordic feel throughout their music. Also another band worth mentioning is Cathedral, with their 1978 album Stained Glass Stories, which was no doubt a big inspiration for nglagrd. The album starts off with &quot;Jordrck&quot; which sounds like the band revisiting SFF's Symphonic Pictures. There are some really loud passages with loud guitars and organ, which suddenly become quiet, with acoustic guitar, Mellotron, and flute. The next three cuts, &quot;Vandringar i Vilsenhet&quot;, &quot;Ifrn Klarhet till Klarhet&quot; and &quot;Kung Bore&quot; all follow the same pattern: unbelievably complex music, where the band does one thing, sticks to it for a couple minutes, then move on to the next thing, often with loud passages becoming quiet and vice versa. Certainly the band might revisit a previous theme, but often just moves on to the next thing. The music requires your full attention, meaning it'll probably require a few listens to get it (as many good prog albums often are). It's amazing a band like nglagrd pulled off such a great album in the otherwise bleak world known as 1992. Old-time prog rock fans were obviously happy with this band, as they harkened back to the glory days of prog, and totally avoiding any '80s and '90s modern elements. It's also pretty safe to say that without nglagrd, the '90s prog rock revival wouldn't have happened, and bands like Anekdoten, Landberk, Spock's Beard, The Flower Kings, Sinkadus, etc., wouldn't have had the recognition they do now. No doubt about it, Hybris is a total must for all prog rock fans.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I was at this concert along with 52,000 screaming Shania fans!! It was really awesome to see Shania's first concert in the USA in over 3 years. I had seen Shania previously at two of her Come On Over Concerts, and she was awesome. This concert topped those two previous concerts experiences. Shania and her band put on an incredible show!!! It was a mixture of her old and new songs. It is great to see she has made the whole concert experience available on DVD. Shania shows what a versitile artist she is. During this concert, Shania goes from country, to rock, to pop, and back to country all in 2 hours and 20 minutes.
0385335482|4.0|I squirmed in my seat through most of this book...it was like a funny, surreal, living nightmare. <br />Becky's incessant rationalizing is nothing other than perfection-the excuses Becky makes to herself are incredibly accurate...and FUNNY! Funny, because most have us have given ourselves these exact excuses...<br />This book made me very agitated, though..as Becky dug herself deeper and deeper into debt, I found myself annoyed to the point of being uncomfortable. This is something my nightmares are made of- an incredibly frusterating, lingering, self-generated predicament. <br />Becky's never ending lack of self-control was bordering on the pathetic, but this portrayal was carefully covered up with the humorous, naive, and flat-out ridiculous thoughts that continued to run through her head.<br />Anyone who truly has a problem with BLOWING all their money should read this book.
B00005A0N5|5.0|wow.<BR>ok, let me type it again.<BR>wow.<BR>one more now.<BR>WOW!!!<BR>I haven't yet heard any of nightwishes other albums yet in their entirety... but i have a feeling from what i've heard so far that this is my favorite of them all! the talent this band has in every aspect... music, percussion... vocals.. .it's truly mindblowing.<br />STARGAZERS - 9/10 - not THE great nightwish song ever... but a very energetic and excellent start to this album!!! it really does grow on you.<br />GETHSEMANE - 10/10 - it was upon listening to the demo of this song that gave me the desire to investigate nightwish. this is so far my favorite song done by nightwish... the chorus is amazing, but the only bad thing is that it's only in the song twice!!!<br />DEVIL AND THE... 8/10 - i must say... i'd give this song a higher rating if not for the pitiful male vocals in it. it makes them sound like rammstein. however, the parts without him more than make up for the parts with him... kind of a scary song!!!<br />SACRAMENT OF WILDERNESS 9/10 - the music to this song isn't anything spectacular... and neither are the choruses... however... they are both rather good and go together really well, which makes the song sound alot better than it really should. very techno like, even for nightwish.<br />PASSION AND THE OPERA - 8/10 - don't get me wrong, an 8/10 is good, but when i say that this song isn't the best... i mean in relation to the rest of this album. it is melodic.. but not as melodic as you'd expect coming from this band.<br />SWANHEART - 8.5/10 - this song is kinda boring the first few listens... but it's a nice light track to calm things down a bit, and the more you listen to it the more beautiful it sounds.<br />MOONDANCE - 7/10 - this song seems to be some sort of a pirate theme... or atleast it sounds like one. the music is catchy, but a bit corny at the same time, as are the &quot;hey hey&quot;'s at the end of it!!!<br />THE RIDDLER - 7.5/10 - hmmm... i wouldn't give thhis song a7.5 out of 10 if i thought it was a bad song... however... it's not the greatest. i mean, don't get me wrong the song is good, but not a good represenation of the album as a whole. <br />THE PHAROAH SAILS TO ORION - 8.5/10 - the music and piano on this song are very cool sounding.. but once again the male vocals destroy this song. once you get passed them though, it's a good song. <br />WALKING IN THE AIR - 10/10 - i was very very VERY upset when ifound out that this was a cover song that nightwish had done... but that doesn't erase the fact at all that the voice of the lead singers (can't remember name for the life of me) voice is amazing in this song and so is the blend of musical sounds. <br />NIGHTQUEST - 8.5/10 - i allllmost gave this song a 9, but it's just not quite deserving enough. i love the music though and the chorus. very welly constructed song<br />SLEEPING SUN - 9.5/10 - this song also takes getting used to... but after a few listens you'll get it. a very nice and mellow ballet. <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Someone complained of 10 minute songs in their review. This is dream theater, not quiet riot. That IS why we buy these discs. Their last disc was the 1st one I didn't fall in love with but  this is a return to images and words and awake and in my mind is briliant. Just buy it. I agree it make take a few listens to get the whole picture of what they are doing here. I bought this Tuesday and it has been the only disc I have listened to since. To the person who complained of the long songs, you most likely can get about $5 for this at your local cd trade in place; There should be a good selection of Poison, Samantha Fox, or maybe even a choice Ratt disc with 3 minute songs for you. To the rest of us, just buy it now if you didn't.

The songs are SOO soothing and emotional, i love it on those days when im depressed lol, but no seriously, the songs went AWESOME with the movie, Bryan Adams scratchy voice was PERFECT, i dont know why ppl cant seem to get that, hm oh well, ne ways i love it so much and i TOTALLY reccomend it!
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I remember when Empire first came out.  I remember rushing to the store at lunch, tearing open the long box, pulse racing as I put the CD in my player at work.  Operation Mindcrime was a such a flawless 100 carat diamond that I couldn't wait to see what Queensryche could carve out of their next piece of carbon.  An hour later I was in shock and scouring the liner notes for the inevitable scribble - &quot;and big thanks to Yanni for helping us out with this album&quot;.<br />Hearing &quot;Train of Thought&quot; for the first time brought back memories of that disappointment.  One or both of the Six Degrees discs never leave my changer and have protected altar status in my iPod.  But Train of Thought is a charcoal briquet that would probably serve better as a source of heat than music.<br />Where is the usual songwriting with the complexity and intertwines of a good Seinfeld episode?  Train sounds like a jam session - like Liquid Tension Experiment 3 without all the forethought and planning.  A jam session in which players are constantly popping out for a bite to eat.  I can see it- Rudess telling Petrucci &quot;hey, play 64th note scales for a while- I need a burger&quot;.  And what happened to Rudess- a recording tech's elbow push the keyboard slider down all the way accidentally?  And John- we already know you can play fast.  Really, really fast.  But I thought it was the destination that mattered, not how fast you got there.<br />Well, eventually Empire grew on me.  After I accepted that the Queensryche I knew and loved was gone and had been replaced with soccer moms.  Maybe Train will too.  I doubt it though.  While different, Empire still had passion.  Train brings to mind the &quot;Contractual Obligation&quot; album by Monty Python.  It has all the passion of a fleeting Borg / Vulcan romance.  With out any of the cool face gadgets.

B00000ILDF|5.0|I should begin by saying that I am a fan of the Alien movies.  I agree with the last reviewer, that this episode is as enjoyable as the original Alien--but I'd say that it is probably better.  It was the first Alien film that I ever saw, as fact would have it, and so I hold a special place for it.<br />The emotional impact of the film is tremendous.  The characters are intense and three-dimensional, and Ripley herself...well, in this film, Ripley is a tragic figure.  No longer the victim of the first film or the reluctant warrior of the second (and not at all resembling that ridiculous human-Alien hybrid of the fourth), Ripley comes into her own as an experienced expert on all things Alien.<br />I'd end the review here, but I feel it worth mentioning another aspect of the movie that I myself have only recently come to recognize.  This film is rife with religious symbolism.  From the opening sequence, when the silhouette of a crucifix is shown, up until the conclusion, Christianity plays a strong role here, moreso than in any of the other episodes.  Ripley can be viewed as both a Christ-figure and perhaps the Virgin; the theme of redemption is recurrent, as is sacrifice; and could the Alien represent...the arbiter of divine justice?  Keep your eyes peeled for these themes while watching it--it'll double the fun.
B000002UAO|5.0|except in America,where capitol records saw fit to come up with there own albums and song listings.This version of Rubber Soul has been available since 1987,replacing the old version.This is the version that the Beatles and George Martin easily preferred!
B00007BK2N|4.0|To call this movie a &quot;docudrama&quot; is probably giving too much credit to its factual accuracy. In the DVD Special Features there's an audio commentary from &quot;The Real&quot; Tony Wilson, which reveals that this movie is only loosely based on real events and he seems at times to be quite irked at the account of events and Steve Coogan's portrayal of him. And whilst Factory Records and the Hacienda undoubtedly played a huge part in British music and club culture, to refer to it as the &quot;birthplace of rave&quot; is clearly incorrect. For the uninformed fan of the Northern rave/indie/Madchester (call it what you will) scene, this movie is best enjoyed as a comedy, not a historically reliable document.<br />However, the recreation of the Hacienda itself is simply stunning - its visual accuracy is utterly flawless. When I was watching for the first time I had to check on the DVD cover to see if it was really filmed in 2002, because I couldn't believe it wasn't the real thing. I for one am pleased that the film didn't accurately reflect the last couple of years at the Hac, when gang infiltration made the place seedy and at times frightening. I prefer to remember it in the way it is depicted in the penultimate scene of the movie, the fictional `last night at the Hacienda'. For anyone who spent nights and early mornings on that dancefloor, this scene makes this a must-own DVD. It will bring back happy memories and a strange feeling in the pit of your stomach of yearning for something that you once had that you know you'll never quite get back. It's not real, but in a way it's better than real.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|I really enjoyed the score to the movie in addition to the cover material and artist originals. Is any of this included on the disc or is it available somewhere else?

B0000DYJM6|4.0|&quot;Lost Dogs&quot; is the B-side album that we Pearl Jam fans have been waiting for ever since it was promised shortly after &quot;Binaural&quot; was recorded.  Many people rightly assume that B-sides albums are usually not worth getting.  For many bands it's never a good idea to clean out the vaults, because the songs were probably left off the albums because they sucked.<br />However, Pearl Jam is a different case.  If they leave songs off of albums, that means they didn't fit in with the feel of that particular album, and the song doesn't necessarily suck.  This is nowhere more obvious than in the huge hits Pearl Jam &quot;B-sides&quot; have become, such as &quot;Long Road&quot; and &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;.  &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; is a collection of all such songs like those, and it's a great listen for a fan.  It's unique because it sounds more like an actual Pearl Jam album than a piecemeal recording.  The band spent years putting this together, and it shows as everything flows together beautifully.<br />This recording simply is a must for a Pearl Jam fan.  Even the most avid downloaders are probably missing half the songs on here, and at $13.99 you won't find a cheaper double album anywhere else.<br />As for the songs themselves?  Many of these are true top quality Pearl Jam.  Besides the obvious greats (&quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;, &quot;Footsteps&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&quot;), there are unknowns that jump out at you as well, such as &quot;All Night&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Whale Song&quot;, and &quot;Fatal&quot;.  The album is put together in a great order, with the first disc notably rocking harder than the second one.  Some inclusions are questionable- did such songs like &quot;Drifting&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Brother&quot; really deserve to be put on the album more than &quot;Long Road&quot; or &quot;Leatherman&quot;?  On the other hand, Pearl Jam's always been known for their surprises and not catering to more mainstream fans.<br />On a quick closing note, I'm really ecstatic that the band decided to include the rare &quot;Bee Girl&quot; as the Disc Two closer.  I think this is one of the most beautiful songs the band ever did, and I'm glad it's &quot;lost&quot; no longer.<br />Long live Pearl Jam.  This is a great holiday gift for the fan, along with &quot;Live at the Garden&quot;.
B00005JMFO|5.0|i thoght this movie was so fun! i went and saw it with my mom (because i'm just 14) and she loved it too. it has alot of nudeity in so its not the best if you want to take your kids. and the plot line is so cool, because all of the storys are some how connected, so that makes it really cool. ohh, and also, see this movie if your a hugh grant fan;)
B0000VCZK2|1.0|Ready for the movie?  Ready for the Ultimate Edition?  Ready for the Special Ultra Limited Collector (with numbering) 10-disc edition?<br />What am I driving at?  I would love a show of hands of who is sick and tired of a series of movies being released, only to in turn have special releases with deleted scenes, and in turn ultimate releases with deleted scenes, making of documentaries, etc.<br />So, after having purchased Legacy when it first came out, we are now presented with the Quadrilogy -- after getting past the initial guffaws of the title, I'm annoyed that YET ANOTHER SPECIAL EDITION HAS BEEN SLIPPED PAST ME.<br />Case in point -- Lord of the Rings.  I was disgusted to learn that after having purchased Fellowship that they were going to release ANOTHER edition that had added footage, etc.  The same has been done with Terminator 2, Stargate, and Army of Darkness.  Although it has not been done yet, I would not be surprised if Lucas follows suit <br />If you're going to release something, do it right the first time and stop wasting our money.<br />Five stars for LEGACY.  1 star for the blatant commercialism that Quadrilogy intends to reap.
0786867973|4.0|I've had a year to work with this cookbook, and there's still several recipes I haven't gotten to. That being said, there's not a single recipe in this book that doesn't make me go, &quot;wow, I must make that.&quot; The pictures are mouth-watering, her friendly writing style is inviting, and the recipes themselves are usually pretty good. I find that with many cookbooks I need to play around with amounts and types of ingredients - and when you're cooking from this book, it's best to use the highest quality stuff you can get your hands on for the best results (that much I found out when I had to use some lower quality butter and flour, and my muffins didn't turn out as well).<br />If you like to play with your food, or rather, play with the making of food, this book is a great guide. You can dive in to these easy recipes and have a ball. Nothing is particularly complicated, and most of the recipes turn out to be decadent and wonderful. I especially liked the muffin recipes, and the rosebud madeleines. The snickerdoodles didn't turn out well at all, but it could be a simple preference.<br />At any rate, you won't be disappointed in this book, as it's beautiful and useful, and just thumbing through its pages can make you feel like you're a domestic goddess.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This terrible, unecessary film redeems none of qualities that made its two predecessors so enjoyable.  Arnold's acting is much more wooden than usual, Nick Stahl's John Conner is incredibly flat, and the film would be no different if Claire Danes were written out of it.  It has virtually no story that Mostow has obviously tried to hide by slamming the audience with sequence after sequence of mindless action.  Its no wonder Cameron wanted no part, he knew to leave well enough alone.  This was made for one reason and one reason only, if you watch the special features you can almost see the dollar signs in the producers eyes.
B00004CWO8|5.0|Swan Lake is one of the most representative pieces of the ballet. With wonderful music by Tchaikovsky and a good story it is one of the great pieces of ballet in the IX century.<br />In this new version of Swan Lake Matthew Brooke gives it a few new touches,the main one is off course the fact that the swan are males.This is, in my opinion, a refreshing touch to a classical with one of the best dancers of ballet in the UK,that is Adam Cooper, the great performance by Scott Ambler and one of the best choreographies I've ever had the fortune to see.<br />The other cast is also great, Fiona Chadwick is not a bad dancer at all, Emily Piercy play the girlfriend very well and gives an amazing turn to the story later on. Barry Atkinson fit perfectly for the part of the cynical old man and the company of swans give a touch of humanity to the swans, making them not just a decoration. <br />In this production there's also the change of time,as the story is now presented in a modern era and not in an old time with carriages, crossbows and old-fashioned castles. This is also a good change, its a touch of delicacy in the way of making this  a sort of &quot;fairy tale&quot; in a modern time,in a modern city,among the &quot;jungle of metal&quot;.<br />So what I'm trying to say is don't be a fool, master works like this are not produced in every generation, and the chance to see Odette/Odile perfom 32 fouettés,I bet Cooper is still cursing Pierina Legnani, is not seen everyday.<br />So buy it,you won't regret it.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Well I am a huge fan of Soundgarden and I think Chris Cornell is one of the greatest vocalists and songwriters out there.  I am a fan of Rage Against the Machine solely for Tom Morello, probably the greatest guitarest in modern rock.  Zach pretty much held the band back but with Chris on the vocals the band just takes off.  I don't like to look at this band as a compilation band though, I like to look at them as a new band.  You can hear Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine influences but they still have a sound that is all their own which is what puts them a step above what everyone expected.  I agree the bassist and drummer aren't the greatest but thats what Chris and Tom are there for, to carry the band.  They are the highlight of the band, not the bass solos or drum solos, they are just there to carry the beat, and they do a good job at that.  Compared to all the new rock coming out, crap like Good Charlotte, Sum 41, and all that new pop-punk, this is a refreshing change to where rock music is going.  If more bands were to make rock music instead of trying to conform to whats the &quot;in&quot; thing right now, modern rock would be a whole lot better.  Until then, we have Audioslave, Blindside, P.O.D., Switched, Earshot, Social Burn, Trapt, and Queens of the Stone Age.  Everything else out there is way too poppy.  If this conglomeration of great rock stars is this good, I wonder what Velvet Revolver's cd is going to sound like.  Get this cd.
B0000AM6LY|4.0|Soulful and smooth, HOME is a great album of songs especially the Hall and Oates inspired and sampled &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Money In My Pocket&quot;.  Could kick myself for missing Simply Red when they were here in NYC about a month ago.  In an age of Clay Aiken and Josh Groban sugary pop, it's great to hear a real blue-eyed soulful voice like Mick's!  Never better!
B0000DJZA0|1.0|because it sucks so bad i give it one star.<br />the cranky reviewer knows exactly what he's talking about.  i was AT the show on the 21st and it sucked so bad i vomited all over my girlfriend.  and she had on this great red tight new shirt that i'd bought her just so we could go to the show together.  man she was smoking.  anyway, she broke up with me that night cause i threw up on her.  man that sucks.  because of this band the love of my life is gone.  AND her smoking body.  <br />while i may not agree with his assertions that duran duran are the best band ever - i think that it's whitesnake - he raises some very valid points about many of his very well-intentioned and well-researched opinions.  mike and dan, get a life - stop playing D&amp;D!!!
B00005JL78|5.0|It seems contradictory to use the words &quot;blockbuster movie&quot; and &quot;intelligent story&quot; in the same sentence, mostly because the big budget movies that fill the summer season's screens lack any kind of real depth and instead feature dazzling special effects and characters that are dazzling, but completely unbelievable.  So it is interesting to note that, while &quot;Minority Report&quot; dazzles the audience with a future that is slick, cold and high-tech, it also delivers a story that is engaging, challenging and even thought-provoking.<br />Set in the year 2054, &quot;Minority Report&quot; is the story of a new form of law enforcement, an agency called &quot;Pre-Crime&quot; that uses pre-cognative telepaths to hone in on murder victims and murderers before the actual crime takes place.  By forseeing the future, these officers can prevent murders from occurring.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) heads up this department until the pre-cognatives have a vision that depicts Anderton committing the act of murder.  <br />Anderton, confused by the vision, and desperate to clear his name, runs and goes into hiding until he can figure out the meaning of a vision that one of the precognatives shares with him that somehow has to do with his own future actions.<br />Confused?<br />I was too, initially.  The movie, which is far more intricate than my synopsis above suggests, is not a film to be viewed casually.  If you are looking for mindless entertainment, this is not the film for you.  Instead, this film builds layer upon layer, with complex and interesting dialogue between completely developed and believable characters.<br />Anderton, who became an officer of &quot;Pre-Crime&quot; did so because his son was abducted from him, and much of the story surrounds not only the physical events that are occuring to him, but also the emotional impact and ramifications that one, single event had, and how it changed him forever.  Mixed up in a conspiracy that reaches to thevery heart of &quot;Pre-Crime&quot;, Anderton must deal with his own guilt, anguish and fear, while trying to determine the cause of the actions that are playing out, leading up to the murder he will ultimately commit.<br />The movie has a very cold look to it.  Spielberg, whose films are known globally, took a very definite approach to this film.  The colors are drab, done largely in blues and greys, and the film itself has a very grainy feel.  The camera work too is shaky, consistent with the type of footage seen in documentaries and shows like &quot;COPS&quot;, giving the film a gritty and dismal look that is far from the glossy images so commonly seen in Spielberg's works.<br />The soundtrack, by John Williams, whose music is heard in most of Spielberg's films, provides a soundtrack that is erie, haunting, beautiful and dark, again, adding a dimension to the stories abysmal feeling.  <br />The action sequences are elaborate, and the effects first rate.  So many films today, especially those that rely heavily on CG animation, tend to look animated, artificial.  The world created here by Industrial Light and Magic is completely convincing, and the effects blend beautifully into the film, even with the grainy look that was achieved by Spielberg while shooting.<br />As a whole, this is a complex, intelligent thriller, with a storyline that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.  I think that the primary reason this film didn't achieve larger success in the theaters was its marketability compared to many of the other films that were being released at the same time.  Because of the darker tones, this film is not for everyone, but it is definitely a worthwhile experience, and a film that should be viewed multiple times to attain the full experience of the story Spielberg has created.<br />Scott Kolecki
B0000E1ALR|2.0|Like countless other fans, I bought this for the bonus disc. But bonus is perhaps too generous a word. Forty-seven minutes and twenty-one seconds? Better than nothing, I suppose, and there are some gems, like &quot;Trapped,&quot; &quot;Viva Las Vegas,&quot; and &quot;County Fair.&quot; But considering the incredible wealth of material still not released by Mr. Springsteen, the disc fell fall short of expectations. Where are older rarities like &quot;Richfield Whistle,&quot; &quot;Sugarland,&quot; and &quot;Don't Back Down&quot;? Or, for that matter, newer live treasures like &quot;The Promise&quot;? Any fan could easily have filled the remaining thirty-three minutes with superb material, so why couldn't Columbia Records?<BR>As for discs one and two, Mr. Springsteen said it best: &quot;depends on who's doing the listening.&quot; How do you fit a thirty-plus year career into one hundred and sixty minutes? To their credit, at least these discs are relatively full. If I really want a best of, I'll make it myself.
0671027387|5.0|I finished this book at 4am this morning. I typically read after going to bed, just before cutting to black. I had to force myself to put this one down (just twice).<br />I won't bother with any plot details, there are plenty in the other reviews. There's lots of details, well delineated characters (well...maybe Senator Sexton was a bit shallow, but then again, he's a politician, and we expect that, don't we?).<br />I found the premise believable, the storyline believeable, and perhaps most of all, the characters were believeable. Others might argue that parts of the story are over the top (such as using Delta Force to eliminate political adversaries), but where politicians are concerned, I am no longer surprised.<br />Read this book. If you like techno-thrillers, you'll like this book. If you like strong female characters, you'll like this book. Step aside Tom Clancy, you've been outdone! I'm off to the bookstore to buy Dan Brown's other books.

B00008J4P5|5.0|'Elephant' is the second exellent White Stripes album in a row. While it's not quite the equal of 'White Blood Cells,' it does provide another collection of great songs. The stance and sound on this album is slightly different than on the last, but not so much that you wouldn't recognize it. There are no standout, amazing songs such as Fell in Love With a Girl or Hotel Yorba, but  the more cohesive sound of 'Elephant' makes up for that. There are no weak songs here, and Ball and a Biscuit is as dirty as white blues gets. This could be the record of the year in 2003.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|The newest Coldplay release really shows why they are probably the best modern band today. This cd shows how coldplay displays its raw emotiom live. Their songs are some of the most creative around and bring back that mellow rock feel that old radiohead used to show. Also I want to ask cranky reviewer, are you really being serious or are you just trying to piss people off? If your trying to make people mad, stop. If your being serious, stop.
B000002KMV|3.0|Not quite prime time Prince material.  Nonetheless, there are some good bouncy tunes.  Of course the title track stands strong as well as the album closer Jack You Off.  Do Me, Baby has a captivating slow groove and Joy is just enjoyable.  Funny when you find the right word.<br />Definitely a good album to put on when you feel like dancing.  However the eight songs do not distinguish themselves as much as later releases(1999, Purple Rain, Sign O' The Times)would.  However, there is some Joy that you will experience when listening to this CD.

B0000E1ALR|5.0|The three discs break into a two disc retrospective and a one disc rarities.  The two disc retrospective expands the Greatest Hits album for the most part.  The rarities disc extends the Tracks collections.  I think they should be reviewed separately.<br />First Two Discs<br />A retrospective is a judgement, a selection.  Can argue what to put in and what to leave out.  Based on what was important at the time of release?  Based on what still works well today?  Cater to those who have been on the whole trip, or those who joined when the popularity exploded, or those who are just getting on board?<br />The first two discs contain one to three songs from each of the twelve original studio albums, plus Streets of Philidelphia (from Greatest Hists), and live versions of American Skin and Land of Hopes and Dreams (from the NY Concert album).  Compared to Greatest Hits which covered eight of the studio albums (no songs from first two and released before the last two) there is more even representation.  More from some, less from others, different choices.<br />This is not definitive.  Nothing of this nature can be.  What I think this retrospective achieves is a fair sampling of the artist's intentions across the studio albums.  The ambitions.  The emotions.  The subjects of interest.  The musical styles.  The performances.  As a result we have the growth and directions nicely laid out, and can enjoy the results.<br />Sonically the remastering is great, separating the instruments (especially on the earlier works) and expanding the dynamic range.  I fell in love with Sandy and Rosie all over again.  The rhythm section particularly comes more alive in this release on disc one, compared to the original releases.<br />Third Disc<br />While the restrospective is the essence of the career, this third disc captures something else important.  Bruce wrote much more music than was released on albums, or at least his albums.  Some were played in concerts and that was it.  Some made itinto the studio with another artist.  Add that the E-Street Band could cover a standard as well as anyone and you have a lot of music that is memories, or inaccessible to those who missed the concerts.<br />This extra work is known to the diehards, much captured on the Tracks releases.  But there are still those which &quot;got away&quot;.<br />From Small Things is one that did not fit at the time and Bruce gifted it to another artist (Dave Edmonds).  Some covers like Trapped and Viva Las Vegas have appeared in concerts and have become standards in the set list rotations.  Others appeared in movies, such as Dead Man Walkin'.<br />This disc is not an attempt to capture it all, or perhaps to even try summarizing this aspect.  It is a sampling, and a continuation of a process of getting all the good stuff out.  It also shows a range of experimentation and different styles that perhaps many do not associate with Springsteen.  In which case, welcome to a few surprises.<br />Conclusion<br />I have listened twice now and for me this is two separate pieces.  I know how they complement each other in Springsteen's career.  But on the stereo they just work as two distinct collections.<br />BTW, if you don't already have the album collection then this is probably the best single purchase introduction.  (I used to recommend the three disc live album in this regard, but that ends in 1985 and there has been a lot of music since).  If you do have the album collection then you buy this for the remastering work on the first two discs and to have the third disc.<br />And I think we all pray that at some time the remastering effort goes into the early ten studio albums and they are rereleased.  (Hey, could even slip in some of the escapees with the longer play time of CDs).
B00007BH5C|5.0|The song featured in the two towers trailer is not in the two towers soundtrack, but it is in the movie called &quot;requiem for a dream&quot; starring Jennifer Connelly.  You might be able to get the soundtrack for this movie.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|Unfortunately, LOST DOGS is a slightly disappointing album for anyone who is already familiar with many of the tracks.  Although 31 songs are certainly worth the price tag of roughly 15 dollars, a number of songs weren't released in their best versions.  &quot;Footsteps,&quot; &quot;Hard to Imagine,&quot; &quot;Otherside,&quot;and &quot;Alone&quot; all have different takes that are better.  The Jeremy single contains a Footsteps version minus the harmonica, which is much better.  Versions of Hard to Imagine and Alone exist with better lyrics, and Otherside had a guitar part during the bridge extracted from it, which is a shame since it worked beautifully with the vocals.  <BR>    It also is missing the likes of State of Love and Trust, Angel (which is tragic because it was originally scheduled for the album), I Got Sh*t, Long Road, and Breath, all songs that could have replaced weaker offerings.  <BR>    For those of you that haven't heard many of the songs before, this will still be a wonderful album.  All the songs that have better versions are good, they just neglected to put the best possible version on the disc.  Also, the hidden song is a treat, and a beautiful piece.  And for whoever called Riot Act disappointing, you're nuts.  Riot Act is much better than Binaural and Yield, the best album since No Code.

As a result, he can carry the reader across a vast array of events in a very interesting and compelling way.<br />In Avenger, you move from the battle of Britain to tunnel rats in South Vietnam to drug addicts, prostitution, and mob violence in modern America to brutality and vicious killers in the Balkans to Osama Bin Laden and the challenge of modern terrorism to a CIA effort to get Bin Laden using one of those Balkans murderers.<br />You will find the story stunningly realistic with truly descriptive and graphic violence consistent with the brutality of the all too real modern organizations of terror.<br />You will also be vividly reminded that evil exists in the world and that all too often only a forceful, violent intervention by heroic people can stop those who brutalize, rape and humiliate their fellow human beings.

It was one of the few that I could listen to straight through without having to skip any &quot;filler&quot; songs. Every song brought something new as frontman Adam Levine's voice masterfully leads us through each song bringing us closer to Jane. I love &quot;This love&quot;, &quot;She will be loved&quot;, and &quot;The Sweetest goodbye.&quot; I can't wait for their next album.

I think everyone should own this movie.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is the rare book that combines ingenious writing with an important theme, neither being sacrificed to the other. The teenage Alex and his band of \\"droogs\\" or friends roam around a futuristic, dystopian city, beating and robbing people with no remorse. When Alex is imprisoned he is chosen for an experimental procedure that will \\"cure\\" him of his violence, but also of his passion and creativity. <br />I like this book because no one is spared--both authoritarianism and anarchy are skewered. Burgess clearly believes it is a \\"sin\\" to force man to be good, but he does not think man is incapable of being redeemed. In an odd way, this book turns out to show a rather old-fashioned morality.<br />The book is 21 chapters long, but the original American edition left off the last chapter. This edition adds the final chapter, which changes the meaning and lessons of the book RADICALLY. If you have only seen the movie, which is adapted from the original American edition, you have not learned Alex's whole story! I am not sure if I prefer the book with the added chapter or without; you can decide for yourself which is more realistic.<br />Although much of Alex's speech is invented slang, adapted from Russian, we learn the meaning of the words quickly. However, despite the excitement and relative brevity of the book I had to take several breaks in reading, simply because pausing to decipher all the slang words gave me a headache. So don't expect to finish the book all in one sitting even if you are really enraptured by it. Definitely read it, though.

Even my friend can't get with this one, and he's as big a Badu fan as I am, or was.  &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;Bump It&quot;, the only ear-catching songs here can't even save this CD from musical ennui.  Erykah repeats hooks way too many times, songs linger on forever and the beats are so lifeless they need a defibrillator to revive them.  EB dropped the ball on this one, and if she doesn't hurry and return to the down-home soulful, funk flava that permeated &quot;Baduizm&quot;, I'm gonna have to stop listening to her...BUT, uhhm, I'm kinda doin that now.  Better luck next time, Erykah!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Ok, when I bought this album my first idea was that it's not going to be any where near &quot;Images and Words&quot; or &quot;Awake&quot;. I thought wrong. Usually when I get people into bands I always tell them to get their old stuff first, not the new yet. This album is as good or better than their old stuff. So it's good for any new Dream Theater fan. Is &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; better? Yeah. But I don't think I should believe they will ever do better than that one. Anyway, get this album. If you're smart you will.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I own all of Sarah McLachlan's cds now after this purchase and this cd is just amazing.  I am drawn in from the beginning with Fallen and the use of her voice in this song just has me holding my breath!  I am also quite a fan of the songs &quot;Time&quot; , &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; and &quot;Trainwreck&quot;.  Those songs are also incredible.  Sarah does a incredible job of really showcasing her talents as an artist both with her vocals as well as her writing.  They are very emotional songs.  They also show a different, yet refreshing, side to her.  Highly, Highly recommended!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I fell in love with this movie from the first time that I saw it in theatres.  I was disappointed that it didn't have a longer run and I have been looking for a dvd release for months.  This movie is beautiful: dramatic and comedic all at once.  I think that it is a wake-up call for people, showing these students pursuing their dreams while living life simply to be living, enjoying all that is life.  This movie is especially personal to me, because the life these students are living has been a dream of mine.  I know that it may seem a romanticized view of the world to some, but it feels so real and fresh and I think everyone should have that kind of eye-opening experience even if it is only in a movie.  L'auberge just might make people question their priorities and realize all that they're missing from life.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  I've been raving about it for months.
B00000DGSN|5.0|I just finished listening to Highway Star and had to write. This is one of the greatest recordings of the one of the greatest rock songs played by one of the greatest bands I have ever heard. Perhaps the greatest. Deep Purple had the perfect rock intonation, phrasing, tone, and dynamics that one expects from a band (they performed from 1969 to 1973), but their musical intelligence, their sense of abandon, and their intense and continuous concentration was extraordinary. I listened to the great Child In Time with tears running down my cheeks, I don't remember that happening since a performance by the Moody Blues many years ago. The recording is technically perfect, clean and clear with appropriate channel separation. It sounds like the mix was done by a musical and technical expert. <br />I can not believe this band is NOT in the rock and roll hall of fame?!
B00004SU5J|5.0|I've owned &quot;Tourist&quot; for two years now, and last night was the first time I really &quot;listened&quot; to it without skipping through it...at first I thought this was garbage and I really only liked the song &quot;Sure Thing&quot;, but after cranking this baby up and dimming all the lights down--save the burning of my blueberry scented candles from a certain dollar store that shall remain nameless--St. Germain's &quot;Tourist&quot; has become one of my favorite CDs!  With styles of Jazz, House and Electronica all rolled into one, this is a classic for all fans of those genres.  What I thought was &quot;garbage&quot; satisfied me more than any other CD I own--and believe me I got a lot of them!  &quot;Tourist&quot; is very timely and hip, and a brilliant piece of work from St. Germain!  DANG!!  Do the French know how to jam or what?!!!
B0000CAQ27|4.0|Well, she's back, and she's got a new sound, again.  In her first album, she tried out the R&amp;B scene, and then took a dip into the Pop music with her second album, and her third isn't anything like the other 2.  This stuff is pure rock.  Imagine No Doubt's sound, from their Return of Saturn CD, except slightly more `updated 80's' rock feel to it.  The lyrics aren't filled with angst or bitter memories of her childhood, in the traditional sense.  Instead, there's lots of swearing, lots of veiled and not so veiled drug references, and the mourning of her parent's marriage breakup has been replaced with an attitude, not a bad one or an angry one, but still one that needs lots of yelling.  She uses her vocal range more in this CD, but not as much as she's capable of (I saw her live, and she could give Kelly Clarkson a run for her money on the powerful voice scale).<br />The highlights of this CD are, of course, her first single \\"Trouble\\" which is sure to be an MTV favorite, but it is the only song that has that slightly Pop feeling to it.  \\"God is a DJ\\" is another good song, and will probably be her next single, as it is upbeat (except for the use of the `F' word) and has that slightly manufactured single feel to it, but never the less, it's a good song.  \\"Waiting for Love\\" and \\"Save My Life\\" are also great songs, with a touch of the angst seen in a Gwen Stefani song, harder sounding then \\"Trouble\\" and \\"God is a DJ.\\"  You can readily tell that both `Love' and `Life' was written by Pink, as she has quite the flare for telling a story aimed at the lost and confused teenager.  Although those songs are slightly interchangeable (in the way that \\"Like a Pill\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" are) it is hard to tell if one or both are good enough to be singles.  My favorite song on the disk, \\"Love Song\\" will never be a single, as it sounds only half finished (when you hear it, you'll know what I'm talking about), but is a beautifully sounding song that more then shows off what Pink's voice is capable of.<br />There are only 2 songs that are, at best, painful to listen to, but mostly not because the song is bad, just because I just don't like them.  \\"Last to Know\\" really greats my eardrums, and I'm not sure why.  The last song \\"Hooker\\" a hidden song, is nauseating.  Her voice isn't used well at all, harmony is off, and the music doesn't match the feeling conveyed in Pinks voice.  I'm sure it is the hidden track as it is the worst song on the CD.<br />All and all, it's a great disk, and I'm glad I bought it.  If you are looking for what she put out on her last album, mainstream Pop with Aerosmith doing a duet, you aren't going to get it.  If you are looking for a bunch of songs by Pink, in the hard sounding style of \\"Numb\\" off her last album, you might be better prepared, but most of the music is even harder and louder then that.  I'm impressed that an artist can so easily slide between 3 genres of music, which is uncommon in this age of endless one hit wonders.<br />Most, if not all, the CD's come with a free DVD with some interesting, but not fantastic features.  The DVD is an obvious ploy to try and get people to purchase the disk, not swipe it off the net in MP3 form.  The incentives on the DVD aren't enough to stop somebody from doing that.  However, I bought this CD for $9.99 at Kmart, so if the choice is $9.99 for 14 songs and a free DVD, and downloading the songs for $.99 each off the net, I'd go with the DVD.  I'm not sure if the $9.99 price was a fluke of Kmart's bad pricing, or if Pink is one of the artists who's agreed to roll out the new $9.99 CD's.  Both the edited and unedited versions are available, both have the DVD.  Be warned:  if you buy the disk at Wal*Mart, the CD they offer may have not only edited lyrics, but 2 songs (\\"Oh My God\\" and \\"God is a DJ\\") completely omitted.Pink's voice is capable of.<br />There are only 2 songs that are, at best, painful to listen to, but mostly not because the song is bad, just because I just don't like them.  \\"Last to Know\\" really greats my eardrums, and I'm not sure why.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|Bravo - I have been waiting for so long to hear some new material.  My soul is finally content again! Her voice, soul, feeling, all of it pulls you through your own personal trying times.  She's absolutely amazing time and time again and Afterglow is no exception.  Fumbling is and always will be my first favorite (being the cd I discovered her on)but, I am constantly impressed by her ability to create such beautiful art.
B0000CBHOI|4.0|I've been a student of the blues for a long time, reading what I can find and listening to a wide variety of the music.  But I still managed to learn quite a few details in this set.  I don't consider this set to be the ultimate, but until something better comes out, it's the best you can find.  I would have liked to have seen many more tunes in their entirety, but admit that the tidbits are tasty.  The special features are a real plus, I admit, but I was left wanting more.  The overall video and audio quality are as good as one could expect for the archival material and are excellent for the current material.<br />About the cost: The Amazon discount brings this down to 15 bucks per disc and although I love the material, if I'd had to have paid that price, I would have balked.  I would understand the price for individual discs in the set being that high or even a little higher, but in a set, I expect a significant discount.  These aren't DVDs you're going to watch over and over like you might some movie box sets, so the cost is a real concern.

B000099T2L|1.0|If you're going to go solo, Beyonce, at least try not to sound like you're still with Destiny's Child!!  Highly overrated and reaching the upper echelon of sleazedom, there is really nothing original about you, sweetheart!  I sampled--sniggle--&quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; (Lawd, even the album title lacks originality) at the record store--and talk about mainstream garbage!  For a girl who can write and produce her own material, your creative juices obviously stopped flowing on this project.  &quot;Crazy Love&quot; and the video to this ridiculous song is &quot;showboating&quot; at its finest from you.  If more of your songs would have been along the style of &quot;Work It Out&quot; from Austin Power's Gold Member soundtrack, then maybe I would have supported you by buying this mess...But once again, you so-called R&amp;B Divas fail to impress with stuff that sounds like everybody else in the business...ahhh, BUT if you didn't, then you wouldn't sale records, right?  Anyway--I'll stick to Meshell, Joi, Amel and some other folks who aren't afraid to take dares musically, and don't employ the use of rapper boyfriends and washed-up 80s R&amp;B vocalists to sell records!!  Better luck next time, Beyonce!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I was looking forward to the release of this album as soon as i heard they were releasing new music.  As the release date approached however, i ran into a huge obstacle.  I was going to be in Europe on a class trip when this album was coming out.  Needless to say, i did everything in my power to get to a record store when it came out.  Luckily I found it at some little record store, and never even hesitated to buy it.  Let's just say that this album never left my cd player the rest of the trip.  It is incredible, and any tool fan should def get this right away.  It's a masterpiece.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|This cd is her best by far,although her sound is different from her last cd which was great too her new sound fits her. The best song on the cd would have to be #3 the last to know. Also if you let track 13 play all the way through there is antoher song about 3 1/4 or 4 mins. into it.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|First off, I am quite impressed by Coldplay's performance here. I am slightly disappointed by the CD - DVD combo basically consisting of the same material. I think fans would have been better served by a more complete 2CD set and a seperate DVD that seems to be more common for other groups.<br />That being said, I don't think Coldplay should be compared to other great groups like Pink Floyd, U2, Radiohead or not so greats like Oasis. Coldplay is great on their own. I actually fell in love with them on hearing Clocks on the radio and Chris Martin's performance of Politik at the Grammy's. I am actually a big U2 fan, but find that Coldplay are every bit as good in their own right.<br />I am especially a fan of the piano aspect that is often missing from rock music, yet can easily fit in as Coldplay proves. While there is nothing terribly complicated in Martin's use of the piano, it sounds fantastic especially on this live release.<br />I only hope that Coldplay will continue to write great music and release great albums. They can definitely surpass other great British (or Irish) groups in terms of greatness.

Antonio Banderas doing the tango. <BR>What sucked: The rest of the movie.<BR>Surprises: That Tarantino could be so incredibly bad. <BR>Reason to buy: Only to complete (or pollute, if you like) your Tarantino collection. But then it had to be really cheap.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban's &quot;Closer&quot; cd is brilliant, I recommend it to everyone who enjoy real music, a real vocalist and great performist. He should get more  praise for his work. Instead kids who bop around wearing practically a band - aid get more play. Josh's voice is like velvet. I know I will always enjoy his music, &quot;she's out of my life&quot; is wonderful! and so are the rest of the tracks on this album. you will never be disappointed with Josh.
B000092ZYX|4.0|it's not ok computer .. it's not the bends.. but that doesn't mean its a bad album..  <br />almost every radiohead album has a different feel to the others ( with the exception of kid a and amnesiac ) . in my opinion, they took all the experiences they had with those previous outings, and  used it creating this..  as i said.. not a bad thing.. <br /> i'm not saying this merely because i am a fan, but because it's a great album.. at first, i'd skip a few songs, finding them boring, but after a few listens, the whole thing grew on me.. ( had a similar experience with kid a )<br />in closing, i think there is something for everyone to like here, old fans and new... it'll grow on you too
B000002H6C|5.0|This is the last Speed Metal-album that Metallica made. It`s sad that they didn`t keep on doing that, because ..And Justice For All is absolutely my personal Metallica album. <br />The only bad thing about the sound of the album is the almost total lack of Jason Newsted`s bass. But after you`ve banged your head off after listening to &quot;Blackened&quot; for about a thousand times, you don`t even notice that. That song is indeed a killer. And so are the others.<br />The biggest difference between this album and &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; is the development of Metallica`s musicians. Especially Lars Ulrich`s drumwork and James Hetfield`s powerful voice are a pleasure to listen to. The songs are very complex and also longer than before, but they don`t get boring at any moment. The title track builds slowly from an acoustic intro to great Heavy Metal hammering, &quot;One&quot; changes from a beautiful ballad to a Speed Metal-mayhem, led by the famous &quot;machine-gun riff&quot;, and &quot;The Shortest Straw&quot; is just an irresistible piece of aggression. The album closes with &quot;Dyers Eve&quot;, a fast and compassionate rumble, just like &quot;Blackened&quot; opens the album.<br />If you like any other 80`s Metallica-albums or Speed Metal in general, get this album quick!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have never owned a Christina CD until this one.  <br />The Dirty video came out and I was not that impressed.  Then Fighter came out and I liked it, then another single came out and I liked it.  Then the third single came out and I liked it.  So I gambled and bought the CD.  I tell you the truth...  This is an incredible CD.  There is a song called &quot;Cruz&quot; that has not been a single yet.  It is incredible.  She surprised me with tis work.  This is a must have CD.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Coming from a 16 year old who's never seen the Who live, or even videos of the Who live, this is the greatest DVD of all time!!!  Having been a fan of the Who since I got Tommy for Christmas last year, I bought this DVD shortly after it came out and was absolutely blown away.<br />Reading the liner notes for each song gives you insight into each performance, and quite often made me laugh out loud.  The very first song, My Generation, from the Smothers Brothers comedy hour, is hilariously funny just because Keith's drum explodes like a bomb at the end, setting Pete's hair on fire.  There are also such clips as Entwhistle taking a vintage tommy gun from his bass cass to shoot down Roger solo albums in his back lawn, which is excellent, and of course, the music.<br />My favorite song on the DVD, and now perhaps my all-time favorite Who song, is Baba O'Reilly.  The picture quality is incredible, the energy of the band is unbelievable, the sound is amazing!  The cut of Won't get Fooled Again from the same concert is also one of the best moments on the DVD, when the lasers and smoke cut out in perfect sync with the end of Moon's drum solo and Roger lets out an amazingly cool scream and Pete goes sliding across the stage...wow.<br />Even if you're not a Who fan at all, you wil be after you see this.  Go, buy now!  Enjoy!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|There appear to be critics of the new album. Some say that it lacks soul, that it's not fresh, that the voice has been butchered, that the bass isn't up and as complex as usual. Those critics must have a different album. 'As I Am' and &quot;Honor Thy Father are angry songs and have plenty of soul, though it's darker than usual, IT'S STILL THERE! Myungs bass was a highlight of the album for me-up in the mix and growly- adding a heavier edge to the music. When one looks at the album as a whole, the solos and general 'mood' fits the music very well. The is a monster album and I am amazed at the shallowness of so called fans who are overcritical of the recording. If you like hard prog, this is it. Accept no substitutes. Buy this album and turn it up LOUD and PROUD! DT is still at the top! A must for any collection.
B000001FLI|5.0|NO electric guitar player, not even Hendrix, played with more power than Roy Buchanan.  Heart-rending, bone-crunching power.  There is so much emotion in every note the music transcends categories.  Labels like country, blues, soul are completely insignificant in the hands of Roy Buchanan.  He used NO effects, NO pedals of any kind, just a worn Telecaster through a Fender amp -- no walls of Marshalls.  He said if he needed more volume in a particular room he would just mike the amp.  I had the honor and privilege of seeing Roy live several times during the late 70's and 80's -- some of the finest musical experiences of my life.  I think this is his best recording -- Sweet Dreams, the Messiah, and the Blues -- it will make you cry.  Roy could knock the bark off an oak tree at 60 yards.  Albert Lee, Arlen Roth, David Grissom, Danny Gatton -- all trembled at Roy's approach.
0060537639|2.0|It's a shame no book actually exists chronicling the amazing and far reaching voyages of the Chinese discovery fleet.  This was a massive fleet numbering more then ten thousand men.  It was larger then anything the Europeans would ever put to see to serve the sole purpose of discovery. The Chinese fleet was also an anomaly.  China was the `middle kingdom' and the Chinese knew they were the center of the universe.  So it was odd the prior to 1421 a large fleet was sent five times to discover new lands.  The Chinese did not try and conquer these lands, and they barely even tried to trade.  Thus it is a shame this book does not detail these voyages more.<br />Instead the author decided to write some revisionist history.  The author decided that `maybe' the Chinese Fleet, on its sixth and last voyage(one whose findings would later be burned and all record of discovery destroyed) `discovered' America.  Apparently they planted some corn and cavorted with the Indians.  The evidence?  Well none.  The author conjures up some interesting stories about a European who accompanied the voyage, and some other theories that support the theory that Cook and Magellan had `maps' that already depicted the new world.  Well lets not go crazy.  If Columbus knew where he was going then why was he scared that his crew would fall off the face of the earth?  There is some question about why Magellan thought he could go all the way around the earth, but just because Magellan had guts doesn't mean he was following Chinese maps.<br />The book is disjointed, the author speaks in the first person far to much and little evidence is used.  It is an interesting book and an interesting theory but unfortunately its just totally incorrect.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I have now been listening to AFTERGLOW for 3 days and it has completely grown on me! I was trepidacious after such amazing past efforts produced  the likes of MIRRORBALL &amp; FUMBLING......... The lyrics and music sound like the same ol' Sarah, but thats what I was hoping for, and that's what I got. I recommend it to any and all who have ever like Sarah's style and hauntingly beautiful voice.--ENJOY!
B00005RFVL|5.0|I heard &quot;Beyond The Sea&quot; on the &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; DVD.  I thought it was fantastic; at first I thought it might've  been Harry Connick Jr., but when I saw it was someone named Robbie Williams, whom I never had heard of, I went to the internet to do some research.  Found out that he was in a UK boy band and was a little wary, but I bought the CD (Import) and was blown away.  Hope he does more of this type of music.
B00000I41G|5.0|This recording, and &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; in particular, is the greatest expression of late-night &quot;bluesy&quot; jazz guitar playing I have ever heard in 35 years of listening.  Kenny Burrell was, and is, the master of this style.  His touch, tone and rhythmic placement of notes -- all are immaculate.  He is joined by Stanley Turrentine on tenor, Ray Barretto on congas,Major Holley and Bill English -- a perfect group. Lots of mid-tempos and minor keys.  Sometimes I listen to the &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; track over and over.  I have transcribed most of it, chords and solo lines -- Fm7, Gm7, Abmaj7, Gm7, etc.  It takes me to a different place and time.  The recording is magnificent, as if the musicians are in your living room, you are lounging at your table 3 feet away, nursing a Tom Collins . . . It doesn't get any cooler.
0385504209|3.0|This is a great potboiler, a page turner, as they like to say.  And why not, with chapters averaging a little over four pages per chapter and thrilling writing to rival Edgar Rice Bourroughs. (How many of you are familiar with the great Tarzan series, as originally written?  And would you rely on these books for information on life in Africa?).  But it's nothing more.  And surely anyone who reads this book to discover what the reality is is in an advanced state of idiocy.
B00005JMFR|2.0|So here you have The Matrix, a modern-day classic describted as the 'thinking man's action movie'. It actually disregards categorisation though, and appeals to a broad range of people. What do you do next? You make two distinctly average sequels, and ruin the whole thing, that's what. The fact that this third film - Matrix Revolutions - is a slight improvement on Matrix Reloaded is sadly not enough to repair the damage done.<br />For a start, Revolutions is ridiculously over-complicated. Your traditional film might start with some questions, and slowly answer them during the course of the movie; Revolutions on the other hand begins with many questions, and ends with many more. Annoyingly, this is despite the fact that several characters try and answer your questions as you go along, none more so than the Oracle, who, if we're being honest, just confuses matters even more. It had all been too simple: in The Matrix, we had a classic good versus evil battle. Now however, the good is splintered into good, alright, dislikeable and bad people inside Zion, and the bad is too puzzling to believe: the Merovingian, the Trainman, the Architect, an unplugged and unhinged Agent Smith not accountable to the machines.... Who is working for whom? And why? It must have been tough for the Wachowski brothers trying to establish some sense of purpose and clarity in the middle of all that, because for the viewer, it is difficult to find any.<br />Secondly, the original film's major strength has all but been destroyed. I'm talking about Morpheous of course. His was a pheonomenal character: cool, swarve, wise and strong, he was Neo's version of Luke Skywalker's Obi-Wan Kenobi - but better. But by the start of Revolutions and beyond, he is barely a bit-part character. He makes absolutely no decisions, leads absolutely no people, has little authority and appears to have little conviction. Everything about him is insipid and weak, and to my mind, it makes Revolutions a worse film; this may be simplistic, but taking the first film's most likeable character and reducing him to nothing leaves a big void. The few rather humourless, and r
0440178002|2.0|Before embarking on these 1100 torturous pages, be warned that though this may be an epic, is is certainly not a classic.  The writing is very turgid and, what's worse, irritating as hell!  I lost count how many times the word 'truculent' - obviously Clavell's favorite adjective - was used  The direct translation of Blackthorne's broken Japanese is irritating and, as others have pointed out, just plain wrong.  And please, scrap the one sentence description of every character we meet along the way....\\"he had three teeth and leathery skin\\"....\\"buck teeth and bulging eyes\\"....blah blah....believe me, it'll drive you nuts.<br />Life's short and time is precious - don't waste it on this bloated monstrosity.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|First off, I like to address the so-called DT fans ripping this album. Sure it's a new direction and not the exact DT we had expected, but because of that doesn't mean you have to bash Petrucci's guitar play and the production. They're trying something different. Give them a break.<BR>This isn't my first review of this album. I feel i need to write a second review based on further listening of the album and a few of the reviews i have read on here. First off this is a huge milestone for Dream Theater in my opinion. Why? Well I think they have accomplished their heaviest album of their 15+ year career. I not saying by any means that their past work wasn't at all heavy or that it wasn't as good. I'm just saying they met up to what they have been labeled for years now...\\"Progressive Metal\\". <BR>After reading several reviews, I have noticed a lot of comparisions to Metallica. I do agree that \\"As I Am\\" has a Metallica feel to it. But just because the complete album, with the exception of \\"Vacant\\", is extremely heavy and dark, it doesn't mean it sounds like Metallica.<BR>As far as the Nu-Metal comments go, I hate to say it, but after further listens, I hear it now. However, Dream Theater (and probably only Dream Theater) pulled it off nicely. They have proved that they can add or subtract styles they have and have not used before and still make a remarkable album with the trademark Dream Theater sound they have perfected for many years now.<BR>\\"Endless Sacrifice has really grown on me. I feel it's the best song on the album with a catchy chorus and an awesome hook. \\"In The Name Of God\\" is also a personal favorite. I get a Queensrche-like feeling during the chorus...which is cool. Notable others are \\"As I Am' & the instrumental \\"Stream Of Consciousness\\". If you haven't picked this up yet, then do so quickly. It's worth it. 10 stars!
B00005AQE8|2.0|I, for one will be glad when this west coast \\"gangsta\\" b.s. is finally put to rest.(13 years of anti-life thinking has got die sometime.)  This album which was blaring out of cars throughout 1996 and I was tired of hearing Tupac's rants about women, Biggie, and jail.There are only two good songs on this trifiling 20 something song fest, \\"California Love\\" and \\"I ain't mad Cha\\". Pac was a gifted lyricist, but he is not the greatest m.c. in rap's history. (that goes to melly mel , chuck d, and run)and frankly this is another example of black  amerikkkan ghetto nihlism (in which he never came from) for profit. I get tired of hearing young brothers say to me that Pac speaks for me as a \\"black man\\" (because he was stupid enough to get shot twice and the second one was fatal please.) all he ever cared about was making money of black suffering along with Suge Knight ,throw this cd in the garbage heap along with any L.A/Compton hip-hop outside of Hireoglyphics, Jurrasic 5, and The Coup. Gangsta Rap has all but killed creativity inside of  commerical Hip-Hop since 1990 it has got to go!!!!!!!!
0671027344|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like The Perks of Being a Wallfower because of its lay-out; instead of being a continuous novel it was a series of letters.  However after the first few pages I quickly found myself enthralled.<br />I strongly reccommend The Perks of Being a Wallfower to any high schooler, and even those who have graduated from high school.  I was able to so closely relate with Charlie, the writer of the letters, and found myself crying and laughing along with him.<br />This short novel is an easy but life-changing read.  It lets us relive those high school memories that we have chosen not to remember, and those high school memories that we will cherish for the rest of our life.  I am sure you will find yourself reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower again and again.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|Who are these freaking idiots from these last 2 reviews. Duran Duran ???? Give me a break!!!! These guys are a joke!!!!! Please don't compare a legend like Springsteen with Duran Duran. I'm  a music junkie that owns 2000 CDs , including all of Springsteen and Duran Duran albums , and think I know what I am talking about. And yes, Springsteen will be remembered in 50 years. He is still making great music after 30 plus years. And Duran Duran isn't even remembered after 10 years. These guys couldn't sell out 3000 seat halls let alone 50,000 seat stadiums like Springsteen is doing night after night now. And Bon Jovi???? Come on, even he has said that Springsteen is his hero and that he isn't in Springsteen's league. I mean, I have all of Bon Jovi's albums and think he makes above average music, but he is no Springsteen. A good measure of an artist's legitimacy and worth is by the number of people who have recorded or covered their songs. Springsteen is one of the most covered artists only second to the Beatles. When was the last time you heard a cover of a Duran Duran or Bon Jovi song. Case closed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has one of the most wonderful voices I have ever heard. He can sing so wonderful and the music really enhances his voice. I think this CD is just as good as the first, i love them both just the same. Also if people don't like the fact that he sings songs already written by someone else then they shouldn't listen to his music because it's not about the fact that he didn't write some of these songs, his voice is incredible and people should see that as the talent.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Rating:<br />***** - Perfect<BR>**** - Excellent<BR>*** - Good<BR>** - Average<BR>* - Poor<br />1. 742617000027 - ***<br />Eerie sounds of sampling mixed in with the phrase &quot;The Whole Thing I Think Is Sic&quot; looped repetitively. Classic SlipKnoT Intro, superior to the one on Iowa.<br />2. (Sic) - ****<br />The first song off of S/T. Heavy and intense, it shows off the technical abilities of all 9 members together. Solid track.<BR> <BR>3. Eyeless - *****<br />Amazing production. Contains the memorable chorus &quot;You Can't See California Without Marlon Brando's Eyes&quot;. Great guitar work juxtaposed against the loud vocals and awesome drumming/percussion. <br />4. Wait And Bleed - *****<br />The break-through song that brought them platinum success. Taylor's ethereal singing is what makes this song stand out. His great vocal range makes this one of the most melodic and commercial songs in SlipKnoT's repertoire. <br />5. Surfacing - ****<br />Awesome sampling/synth work by Craig Jones (5) and impressive scratching done by DJ Sid Wilson (0). Both of their absense were greatly missed on Iowa. Blaring chorus and heavy guitars makes this song a powerful addition to S/T. <br />6. Spit It Out - *****<br />Absolutely Mesmerizing! Easily SlipKnoT's best song to date. Corey's incredibly fast rapping is in perfect timing to the simple but effective guitars of James and Mick. Delivered with absolute perfection. The epitome of this band's musical brilliance.<br />7. Tattered &amp; Torn - **<br />The closest track resembling somewhat of an instrumental on this album. Although initially creepy and interesting, it becomes tediously repetitive. Satisfactory.<br />8. Me Inside - *****<br />Astounding sampling and scratching once again. An extremely beautiful chorus with effective guitars. Short and compelling. <BR>Very well executed.<br />9. Liberate - ****<br />Devastating vocals provided by Taylor but is also fairly catchy. Intensity builds as time progresses. Decent track. <br />10. Prosthetics - **<BR> <BR>An extremely intriguing intro which tanked into a fall-flat performance. Nothing too special. Could have been a lot better.<br />11. No Life - ***<br />A fairly good song with a lot of resemblance to Liberate. A little disorganized at times but still a worthy song.<br />12. Diluted - ****<br />Great lyrics and very original. The replayability of this track is one of the highest on this CD.<br />13. Only One - ****<br />With the equivalent speedy lyrics of Spit It Out, it does a decent job of building up the intensity into the chorus. A bit short but a stimulating performance. <br />14. Scissors - ****<br />Disturbingly intriguing. An incredibly dark and twisted theme but surprisingly listenable. Taylor spills a lung and some organs during in the end.<br />15. Eeyore [Bonus] - *****<br />Without a doubt, the heaviest song on S/T. Joey Jordison (1), who has been doing an outstanding job on the drums throughout the whole album puts on an even more breathtaking exhibition in this gem of a track. Everyone puts on an amazing last-ditch effort to conclude their incredible self-titled debut. <br />Overall - *****<br />Revolutionary Nu-Metal. Highly Recommended.<br />- aZnXgIn.

B0000E1ALR|4.0|Hey Fred Fan. Are you being facetious or are you really that<BR>ignorant. You can't be serious when you say that you like Springsteen's cover of the Manfred Mann song, Blinded by the Light. It is a known fact that Springsteen wrote the song and released it before Manfred Mann and that Manfred Mann covered this song along with 2 other songs from the Sprinsteen Asbury Park album subsequently. And puhleeeeeeezze, Bon Jovi????? Get real. Even Bon Jovi idolizes Springsteen. Springsteen is a legend and his music is timeless. His music has lasted 30 years and will last at least another 50 years MR. Duran Duran fan. Springsteen is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I would bet your life and mine that neither Bon Jovi or Duran Duran (both born in the black hole void of music known as the Eighties and MTV-style over substance years) will EVER be even considered for induction. Over and out.
0385508417|4.0|Skipping Christmas can be divided into two parts. The first is spent building the anticipation of what a wonderful idea it would be to skip Christmas. All the insanity of the holiday season is exposed, making you feel tired just thinking about it, and relieved for the characters who are going to be able to avoid it. However, a plot element that was fairly easy to see coming occurs and derails their plans, which makes the second part of the book. Though predictable, this second part is quite funny. If you ever thought skipping Christmas might be a good idea, or if you just don't enjoy the holiday season, then this is a good read. If you love everything about the holidays, then skip the book. You wouldn't get it, anyway.
0385504209|1.0|These two limited 1/2 dimensional characters, no more developed than a school boys first attempt at creative writing, receive a special key to a Swiss bank safe deposit box and wander off to the bank to find the next secret in their silly trek of Holy Grail gobbledegoop. When they initailly found the key it was tied to a scrambled number that, shockingly like a cold night in December not in Miami, turned out to be the Fibonacci sequence. Oh, my, and upon their arrival at the bank they, low and behold, realize they need an account number. They were shocked in their 1/2 dimensional ways, &quot;We need a accouint number at a bank?&quot; &quot;Oh my, what will we do?&quot; &quot;What could it possibly be?&quot; &quot;You will have to leave if you don't have the number,&quot; says the bank manager. &quot;We have to leave, but we have a key?&quot; But wait, just then one of the two brain cells these characters share in common fires and they realize the Fibonacci sequence is the account number. Duh! Are you dumb as a box of rocks? Is this plot really this bad? Is America really dumb enough to take this trivial book, that should have never gone to print, and make it into a huge best seller? We are lost. The characters, the plot, the writing, everything is horrid, cheap, plastic and dull. This book is akin to seeing a lousy movie and then wishing you could have your two hours back.
B00009APK1|4.0|*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<BR>The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers (2002) You all know the cast! **** I might as well get it out of the way - I am a purist so this review will be pretty critical. I'll start with the negatives however, so that I can finish the review with the praise this film deserves. I will also skip most of the plot detail, because I am fairly sure that most of you know the storyline.<BR>At first viewing, the pacing of TTT might seem a little jerky, as we shift between the various plotlines. One of the problems noted almost instantly is a lack of scale, mainly in Frodo and Sam's story. The Dead Marshes appear too small so that Mordor, instead of being a distant blur on the horizon is constantly close and threatening, the red light of Mount Doom always showing. You lose the epic scale from the book. This shows again when after Helm's Deep, Gandalf and others ride to the top of the ridge. Mordor is strangely close again.<BR>Minor changes like sending the women and children to Helm's Deep will have repurcussions in ROTK which I will not detail because they are spoilers.<BR>Cutting off the end of the book is not a particularly good idea because ROTK is going to be packed with action anyway. Faramir's personality change was one of the things that got me most. Instead of appering as a complete contrast to Boromir, as a true Numenorian who would not pick up the Ring if it were lying by the wayside, he appears even darker than Boromir.<BR>Osgiliath, seemingly served no more purpose than to inform us that Peter Jackson can do amazing things with computers. Well - we already knew that! Osgiliath looked perfect. But taking Frodo and Sam there not only removed the sense of urgency, it diminished the scale even further. Then there was the fact that Frodo and Sam are supposed to know absolutely nothing about the outside world.<BR>Another point that was mentioned - in Osgiliath, Faramir screams, 'Nazgul!'. No one knew who the creatures on wings were until right at theend. The Black Breath etc is referenced, but the characters do not know that the Nazgul are what is spreading terror. The Fell Beasts were not threatening enough I felt.<BR>The Wargs were absolutely pointless and showed the one weakness in the Special Effects. And Aragorn's near death? Death has been faked so many times in this trilogy that it is ridiculous and unbelievable when it occurs and is actually in the book. A few odd things - the Ents' faces were very good, but the rest of them was not substantial enough and Gandalf's reintroduction (to Merry and Pippin), I disliked intensely. Also, Rohan was not the flat green grasslands that it should have been.<BR>The only cast member I disliked? Elrond who seems far too severe! As he is half man, he would not be so harsh on men. Finally - the Great Eye of Sauron. It just didn't fit. Dare I say it, it reminded me of the power coupling in Episode 2, just a different colour!<BR>Enough of bad points, although there were more, I'll move on to the (many) positives!<BR>The cast - well what can I say? New and established members alike, I was wowed.<BR>Sets - especially Edoras. Exactly as I had pictured them in my own imagination. Fangorn was absolutely perfect, as was Helm's Deep. The Black Gate has got to be one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.<BR>Special Effects - especially Gollum. I have never seen such a brilliant CG character. His split personality was perfect too. I felt sorry for him, I hated him, I loved him!<BR>The battle sequences were brilliant. Helm's Deep did not seem too long and who can forget the trail of the Orc armies stretched across the plain?<BR>The destruction of Isengard, the breaking of its dam, I was awed. The tiniest detail was observed. Just look at the detail on the Elven brooches, on armour, the pillars of Meduseld.<BR>And a small thing that I would like to say is thank you to Peter Jackson and his team for their research on pronuciation. If I had had to sit through FOTR with everyonesaying Sawron, I would not have gone to see TTT.<BR>And I really liked the foreshadowing of Aragorn's death. It was incredibly moving, although it did not state that Arwen loses her immortality and dies shortly afterwards, which would have been another moving touch.<BR>Enough from me rambling on! I am not going to review FOTR as well, because I have so much to say. From this review, you might deduce that I dislike TTT because I fear my complaints exceed my praises. I just tend to notice my dislikes more and voice them! It cannot be said I disliked this film - I've seen it many times. I did however, prefer FOTR. That is on of the reasons why I have given this film 4 stars and not the 5 I would give to Fellowship.  <BR>Finally, I wrote this review before I got a chance to watch the extras on the DVD, so I won't be commenting on them.  I eagerly anticipate the Extended Edition, hopefully that will restore some of the things which I felt were lacking.
B00008973Q|2.0|Some people should really stop knitpicking. Get a life, really. All this moping about the destruction and disregard for Kurosawa's unfailing and precise &quot;vision&quot; (whatever the hell that's supposed to mean). We even get a technical expert (sounds like mumbo jumbo to me, buddy boy) further doen the page explaining to us what went wrong. Thanks for the two cents, bro. <br />The man's films aren't that wonderful.... there's nothing too terribly Japanese about them (except for the uneassy superimposition the traditional lore, pomp and pageantry). Also: no American director would get away with filming only battles and their contexts. It's no surprise that vacuous 'thrill' artists like John Sturges and George Lucas used K's films as 'inspiration' for their empty Hollywood confections. There' just nothing else there. Would it surprise you to know that his films were despised and UNPOPULAR in JAPAN (!!). Patently overrated. That's how Kurosawa's unfathomable influence started, with a bunch of pseudo-art conscious Americans in the fifties confusing 'exoticism' with blatent and planned pandering to American tastes. <br />Watch Ozu's &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; out on Criterion (at least we won't have too much moaning about THAT transfer, he?). Stop wasting your money on Kurosawa's one-note junk.
B000002UAO|3.0|I have the 33 record, and does anyone notice that the CD doesn't have the same songs as the record?  What's with that?  My record includes songs such as &quot;I've Just Seen a Face&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love&quot; that the CD lacks.  The record is &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; though these songs appear on &quot;Help&quot;.  Personally, I like the record better, but the fact that it's different just baffles me.  Especially since this record is from back in the day.
B000002LVB|5.0|Initially I hated this album. I bought it after thoroughly enjoying 'the velvet underground and nico' and was expecting more songs like heroin and venus in furs, unfortunatly, i thought at the time, this didn't deliver. I had already downloaded sweet jane and who loves the sun and i liked both of those (especially sweet jane) but when considering those two on their own you don't really realize how standard they are when they are placed on a playlist that reflects the velvets diversity as a band. So I listened to it once and twice and put it away disgusted with having wasted any money on such sell out trash.<BR>       My thirst for the velvets was still insasiable however, I knew they could do better, and buying White Light/ White Heat only made me love them more. I had just finished telling a friend how awesome this band was except for their last crapy album when I decided to give it one last chance. Before this listen it was on my list of things to sell, now however i'll never let it out of my sight, so to speak. Standard? When you compare it to anything else by the velvet underground than yes definitly. That was the problem, its not experimental sonic madness or beautiful gentle melodies, but its still orginal when you compare it to anything else from its time and age. You must listen to it on its own terms with open ears, you'll find its no less musically great than the others, albeit very different. <BR> No IMO its not their best but its still really dam good
0066214122|4.0|I have always been a huge fan of Michael Crichton. He is, in my mind, the most versatile and interesting writer of popular science fiction I know, and he is always able to make his stories so multidimensional. Sphere was many things: a suspenseful tale, a look at a perilous environment, and a fascinating metaphysical examination. While this book is more like Congo than Sphere, it still has plenty of cutting-edge science and more than enough suspense to keep anyone reading.<br />The story goes something like this: Jack Forman, former software manager and current stay-at-home dad, is baffled by his wife's recent odd behavior, suspecting she's having an affair. When he is asked to assist in the project his wife has been working on, he jumps at the chance, but his notions are soon dispelled as he discovers that there are intelligent swarms of nano-organisms on the loose. The book centers on the efforts he undertakes to stop these micro-baddies, who are able to adapt and come up with new tactics at an alarming rate.<br />The writing is excellent, as always, and Crichton is certainly on top of his game in writing a suspense story. It is a story that also asks interesting questions about the future of artificial life. Ultimately, it doesn't become greater than this, though. Sphere was philosophy, Disclosure was social criticism, and those were his best books. In any case, it's good to read another elegant page turner by this very capable writer.
B00005JMFR|3.0|i had been a hardcore fan of the series, and lets face it the first one was a absolute TNT for the brain..great twists,amazing subject and awsome action..2nd one was a lil low on character devlopment and story line but was fun cause of the kik a.. action, multiplying agent smith and the scene with the architiect..but this one was shocking..it shakes a lot of ur belief regarding matrix..cause i m one of those ppl who thought neo cud actually free the humen race..i have no idea what went wrong with this one ..the film just nose dives into oblivion..the allmigty all powerful neo from the 2nd part is just a caricature in this one..morpheous looks completly lost and trinity..she practically sleepwalks..the only saving grace of this film would b Hugo weaving and Jade pinkett smith ..there are few decent sequences like the shoot out in the club ,the war between sentinials and zion and the final showdown between neo and smith..but the style and penache of the first two films doesnt registers here at all..as a matter of fact it seems extremly raw..if u are a person who had been following the series ..no matter what i say but u ll watch it..but b ready to b disappointed..if u r not someone who has been following the series..watch it for the few action sequences..as far as i m concerned ,it was a overall disappointment for me..an anticlimax of the grand finale..well what can u say..every thing that has a begining has an end..sob sob..

0898705525|4.0|In a lucid exposition, G. K. Chesterton calls it the way he sees it. Consider the fallacy of the inner light, i.e., one's own internal inspiration. He says such people who worship the god within worship themselves. He is not talking about the Spirit within in this case, he's talking about self-worship.<br />On health matters. He says there is something unhealthy in the mere pursuit of health. Consider his observation about courage, &quot;Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die.&quot;<br />On things unseen he writes about miracles and people who believe in them. &quot;For some extraordinary reason, there is a fixed notion that it is more liberal to disbelieve in miracles than to believe in them. Why, I cannot imagine, nor can anybody tell me.&quot;<br />He adds that those who believe in miracles do so because they have evidence, whereas those who disbelieve do so because they have doctrine that teaches them so.
B00007KQA3|5.0|The great George Orwell gave his truly profound gift to the humanity in his 1984: a warning about the potential of human beings to create the most horrific totalitarian state imaginable. The fact that most Americans had no problem giving away their allegedly cherished Bill of Rights, in exchange for some vague promises of protection against the number one hundred something cause of death, is a reason for an urgent alarm, I believe, and resonates the warnings of 1984 in a truly eerie way. The movie 1984 depicts the horrors of the orwellian vision of upcoming totalitarianism with no mercy shown to the viewers: it is stunningly realistic and cruel. While not a pleasant movie to watch, it leaves a lasting impression, as it is the ultimate masterpiece with moral and political messages of the utmost importance, therefore highly recommended to anyone not planning to emmigrate to another planet or galaxy in the near future. Benjamin Franklin: &quot;They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security, deserve neither liberty nor security&quot;. <br />&quot;War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength.&quot; (The Three Governing Principles of Oceania - From 1984).
B000089RVX|4.0|I was happily surprised when I had listened this record through for the first time. I like all the songs but I have to admit that you can't find a better song than &quot;bring me to life&quot; on this album. Other songs that I like are the peaceful &quot;my immortal&quot; and &quot;hello&quot;... The rest of the songs seem like they're missing something, like they were never actually finished.. But it's still a great debut..
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album really has to be listened to at least three of four times before you really begin to appreciate it.  When a band is as unpredictable as DT, you have to really decipher the music before you appreciate it.  With that said, this is an awesome album.  True, there is some nu-metal rhythm playing, but there is so much more interspersed in the songs.  All of the songs have absolutely killer instrumental breaks.  This is John Petrucci's shred album.  Although known for his amazing sense of melody, Petrucci pulls out the old metronome and cranks it all the way.  His accuracy and speed is unreal.  Portnoy once again shows that he is a world apart in the drumming category.  James handles all the vocals which most of us DT fans should appreciate.  Sorry John and Mike, but you guys better stick with the instruments.  Myung as always gives plenty of low end.  I do wish that they would utilize his song writing talents more.  All of the songs rule, I do not yet have a favorite.  Do not condemn this disc until after a good solid 4 listens.  After that, you'll be headbanging for sure!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|I must say that this album is or as close as you get to being perfect.  Everything is beautiful and accomplished.  The vocals are absolutely amazing, and so is everything else.  I'll have to say that my favorite of the songs is definately Surrounded.  I recommend this CD to anyone who loves Dream Theater, and if you want to get your friend into them too (worked for my friend.)
B00005R23S|5.0|Bruce Springsteen has great songs, and I always enjoy listening to him. I'm not a real hard-core fan though. IN the 80's in the vinyl era, I bought the River. Somewhere in the 90's I bought a CD, of which I don't even remember the title.<br />BUT... to see him live on video always make me quite happy.<br />A few weeks back, this DVD was quite cheap at a drugstore, so I decided to buy it anyway.<br />It's magic. A real must have, even for me.<br />Go get it and have a real enjoyable evening.<br />It's worth it.
B00000GJ2B|5.0|I went to the video store, plucked this off the shelf, rented it, and popped it into the VCR expecting it to be Rocky. In fact, I didn't even look at the box when I rented this, I associate all boxing movies with Rocky. Rocky this ain't, but De Niro's an okay actor. He's no Stallone, but held his own in his scenes with Pesci, a much more talented, gifted actor. Pesci is the best thing about this flick; if it concentrated more on boxing and less on soul searching it would be okay. In the future, biopicks are only good with fast cuts and in color. This movie moved as slow as molasses. Again, it was decent, and I give it five stars because of Pesci, but where are the cuts?<br />*Scorcese's not that bad a director check out his masterpiece, the Cape Fear remake, his best film.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|wow, peter gabriel has once again made an excellent album. eventhough this album is almost all previously released material, i personally think he chose all of his best work. the sound is well mixed and clear. i give it 5 stars!!!!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I thought this disc was a good listen and a lot different from their other albums.  The lyrics are deep and dark and the songs are long and technical.<br />James LaBrie does great on this album.  I disagree with the people who say that his voice does not belong in heavy metal, I actually say that heavy metal should have more singers like him, he can sing like and angel, or like a devil if needed.  He ranges his voice to both on this album.<br />Petrucci does well for his prog rock unhumanly fast picking, but I think this is one of his weaker albums.  Mainly because (like another reviewer said) The solos seem forced and don't always go anywhere.<br />Myung finally broke out of his shell for this album.  Delivering some of the best bass riffs in his Dream Theater career.  This is a good thing.  I especially like his work on Stream Of Consciousness.<br />Portnoy did very well on this album.  His chops and mad drumming/cymbal crashing style hasn't faded a bit.  Almost overusing his double bass roll, but still impressing me.<br />Rudess has faded into the background in this album.  With minimal keyboard solos and parts.  this is not good, I hope he comes back in the future.<br />The lyrics were good and deep, dealing with such topics as corruption in the church and alchoholism. I hope they don't go the pop way and cuss multiple times on each song in the future, though.  They swear quite a bit more than usual on this album.  But some topics need those a bit in the way they are written.  <br />Overall it is a good CD, not the best (doesn't compare to I&amp;W) But definately up there.  The heaviest and darkest of all the albums so far.  I like what Dream Theater is doing and will remain a die hard fan.
B000002U8G|4.0|My most favorite Pink Floyd song ever is on this album: Echoes. The first track of the album, One of These Days is really good too. But the rest of the songs I just couldn't get into. And I just flat out didn't like Seamus. The songs besides the first and last almost seemed like 'filler' songs. But I like One of These Days and Echoes so much, I still gave this album 4 stars. Echoes is a song I like a lot because of its astounding originality and experimental soungs. It was a masterpiece. This album I found worth getting just because of the two songs.
B0000A2ZO1|3.0|I really wanted to like this last (apparently) of the Star Trek films.  This version is dark and forboding.  The aging main actors give forced, creaky performances.  It's time for a newer, next generation--hopefully to debut someday on TV.  Paramount?
014100018X|1.0|I found this novel quite absurd.  We're supposed to believe that the opening of a chocolat shop in a FRENCH town causes a furore and the enmity of the local priest.  Ridiculous.  France is bursting with chocolat shops, they're everywhere you go, and I don't believe any priest would give a damn.  If the woman had opened a brothel or an opium den or soemthing then I could undeerstand the priest getting upset, but a chocolat shop?  It's too silly for words.  The priest is an absurd caricatur baddie, he might as well be wearing a hat with 'villain' on it.The book is full of heavy-handed church bashing, we are constantly having it rammed home how free-spirited and liberated the heroine is in contrast to the nasty, oppresive priest.  This is an extremely silly book.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Why make a movie about the man universally regarded as the worst filmmaker of all time?<br />Well, simply because the word \\"worst\\" does not even adequately describe Ed Wood. He was the absolute, undisputable worst, unrivalled in his mindless disregard for decent production values, coherent storytelling, credible scriptwriting, and competent acting. If he were just \\"the worst,\\" he would be no more than a mere footnote in cinematic history. But by single-handedly redefining the standards of ineptitude, Wood achieved that rare status of lovable loser. I mean, really, you have to admire someone who approaches his craft with so much grit and determination and so little talent. <br />It takes an A-grade cast to bring to life this story of Z-grade moviemaking. And we have one. Johnny Depp delivers a performance of fire in the title role, giving us a lot of insight into the character that Ed Wood was. Martin Landau (in an Oscar-winning performance) doesn't just portray Bela Lugosi. By golly, he becomes Lugosi, almost convincing us that the horror movie legend was resurrected for this project. Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, George \\"The Animal\\" Steele, and Lisa Marie comprise the ensemble cast that portrays a motley crew of rank amateurs. Think about it, these people had to re-enact the shooting of Wood's movies, looking serious but coming out funny, and doing all that with a straight face.Try that, folks.<br />Appreciate too, the film's most memorable line. At the premiere night of Plan 9 From Outer Space, Wood declares with unqualified conviction: \\"This is it. This is the one I'll be remembered for.\\"<br />Whether you're a fan of bad movies or not, you simply have to see Ed Wood. It's not often that a film comes along that makes you like a man who so admirably succeeded at being a failure.
B00006BTCA|1.0|I'm just so gash darned ticked off that I trusted all these reviewers that gave TOTBL a high rating. Based on those 'Best Album of the Year' and '5 Star' reviews I went out and laid down my 18 dollars. I am very disappointed as I didn't like the music on this CD at all. I thought it showed contempt for the listening public by offering a poor version of a great rock-n-roll style, Post-Punk. I had my suspicions and felt that all the people who'd given them 1 star must not have an open mind to new bands. Something I've always felt I possessed. Unfortunately I was proved wrong.<br />Find a friend and borrow this CD and find out for yourself. 30 second sound samples on Amazon and at the CD store aren't enough. Listen to the whole CD then decide for youself. <br />Burned and bummed out...
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I'll be honest... I have a lot of these songs already. Some of them I have downloaded from questionable sorces, others came to me on cheesy bootleg CDs. It is amazing to hear clear, vibrant versions of these songs! And the ones I haven't heard are even better! I can't believe how much I love these two discs! The Liner notes come with short discriptions of each song, or a special memory from the guys. Albums like this are why I will always love P.J.!!!
B00005JM0B|3.0|Underneath the hood of this machine is a fine action film. Jonathan Mostow does a fine stepping into James Cameron's large shoes. Unfortunately, the one area where T3 suffers in comparison is one of Cameron's strengths as a writer/director--character development. T3 has more in common with The Terminator in that it's a lean, mean action machine. Since the the three major characters and their back story are well known to most fans of the film (I'm counting Skynet as the third character as its presence looms large in all three films), Mostow has the freedom to craft a film rich in action set pieces.<br />T3 has a number of quirky and clever plot twists that enhance the film making it something more than just a remake of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. That's a good thing as, if not for the clever twists in the screenplay and the way director Jonathan Mostow  (U571) turns our expectations of the film on its head, it would be a by-the-numbers franchise extension designed only to garner money. Terminator 3 is really about the cruelty of time. It's about recapturing the past and changing it to thrive in our post-ironic world. With the success of James Cameron's two previous Terminator films and with Arnold's career on a downswing, Arnold wisely chose to revisit the past and help reinvent himself once again by playing the most popular role he's been identified with outside of elect of California. While Arnold is once again cast as the &quot;hero&quot; of the film, it's a hero without conscience and a dark past. The script allows for the hero to redeem himself and discover the little voice inside our head that tells us right from wrong.<br />As Terminator 3 opens we catch up with the savior of humanity John O'Conner. O'Conner (Nick Stahl) has become an itinerant construction worker with no permanent address. The future he was prepared for by his mother (Linda Hamilton who is sadly missed) hasn't come to pass. That's good news in a sense as the whole purpose of the battle in T2 was to prevent the destruction of mankind. Ironically by changing the future she and John and robbed him of his purpose. So he ends up wandering from job to job with his motorcycle his most important possession and no place to call home.<br />When the Terminator (Arnold)  arrives, he's coming to a world that, on the surface, doesn't really need him. Judgment Day has been avoided with the destruction of Skynet. Unknown to O'Conner, though, is the fact that the military has continued the work begun at Skynet. They've developed much more technology based on the original computer chip that was destroyed in the second film. To make sure that the future does come to pass as it was supposed to, Skynet sends back yet another Terminator model.<br />The DVD looks good overall although I found it to lack the sharpness and clarity of the best DVDs currently on the market. The film is available in both widescreen and a full screen version (but not in the same set).<br />The sound utilizes the 5.1 mix better than any of the other films in the series. I did find the mix occasionally harsh and brittle sounding in the sections where the sound was unusually busy. On the whole, though, the transfer for T3 is lacking the visual sharpness I've come to expect. The interaction menu also shows little of the imagination of the other two entries in the series.<br />The extras are, for the most part, located on disc two. Disc one does have the two audio commentaries and trailers for the film and the video game. The extras on disc two are a bit disappointing. The best feature is the Sgt. Candy deleted scene. It's clear why it was deleted it's way too funny and probably wouldn't have fit the mood of the film. It also would have stopped the film cold. The second best feature is the visual effects section but, I have to agree, that the interactive menus is time consuming and a bit of a pain. Storyboards are also included and there's DVD-ROM content associated with the film as well.<br />While T3is a solid entry and conclusion to The Terminator series, the DVD extras are a bit disappointing given the deluxe treatment given to The Terminator and T2. The picture quality while solid isn't the best transfer I've seen.<br /> The sound,however, is quite good and uses the 5.2 format very well. On the whole the T3 DVD is missing the ghost in the machine that haunted The Terminator and T2 so well. It's entertaining and a great action picture but lacks Cameron's detailed character development and thoughtful situations. It's not disappointing (after all, it's not a Cameron film)it just takes a bit of an adjustment if your a fan of Cameron's first two films.is a solid entry and conclusion to The Terminator series, the DVD extras are a bit disappointing given the deluxe treatment given to The Terminator and T2.

B00005OM4N|1.0|I can't believe that this girl pretends to have talent.She sings nasally and babytalks instead of putting any soul and spirit in the songs...All this is marketing and not a cd from a promising artist..Her only asset is her body and her pouty lips and the way she looks into the camera in her videos...This is NOT talent!! Will she continue to show more of her body when she gets in her 50's and 60's???? I doubt it..That's all she has going for her...shallow bubblegum pop...Little girls should know better to buy this crap!!
0385504209|1.0|If &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; sounds interesting to you, you would be far better served by turning to Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot;, which at least makes intellectual demands on the reader.  It is indeed depressing when truly trivial books, as this one is, become best sellers.
0792846710|4.0|good old fashioned cult classic with those lovable killer klowns coming to town and wrapping the people into cotton candy. the clowns are hilarious and some of the killers are memorable. remember the clown that knocks off the guys head and then all those people start running and screaming away and where that clown uses that cop as a puppet, I mean classic. a lot of clown haters will hate this movie and so will they hate IT.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Has anyone noticed that Dream Theater have gotten more weird with time.  This is at least as weird as 6DOIT but with less effort and time spent on it. This is a very heavy, dark, and angry CD.  As one of the other reviewers noted: &quot;If you are a true DT fan, you already own this CD&quot; and I do.  It is aweful!  Being a guitarist for 30+ years, I certainly appreciate great chops and Petrucci is one of the best.  This is an excecise in non-musical over-indulgence by Petrucci and Portnoy.  I am disappointed in the &quot;token&quot; keyboard passages...Rudess deserves better.  This is Metallica doing Dream Theater doing Metallica.  DT needs to get out of the 80's and at least get into the 90's with their musical direction.  Images and Words is BY FAR their best effort and it has been down hill from there.  Don't waste your money on this.  Buy Megellan's Impossible Figures instead.
0783223153|4.0|this movie is about Michael J. Fox(who long ago was accused of killing his wife some how) but all that is gonna rap up as he starts to see a dark shadow thing taken peoples souls(who can it be??). then he starts to see other ghosts and becomes friends with them and he becomes friends with this lady also, Trini Alvarado who investigates other places as well. Jeffrey Combs is the scene stealer in this movie as the cop who wants Fox dead, literally. filled with awesome ghost sequences and some good shocks and the dark shadow effects are great(Jake Busey is the ghost). Jeffrey Combs is mad crazy.
0783225849|2.0|I am a big fan of horror, and believe me, I've watched a lot of them. Indeed, I don't feel like I'm affiliated to any sub-genre in particular. I can enjoy slasher films, as well as those dealing with extreme gore, psychological horror, dramatic horror and suspense, and the atmospheric ones too (my favorites). The problem with this film is not it's age, it's not that is made on B&amp;W, it's simply that is too long and quite frankly, too boring! <br />The vast majority of the times I visit Amazon and read the reviews, people almost always hit it right on describing the movie and those with very mixed opinions result to be either average or slightly good when I watch them. This time, I must admit that I'm apalled by the huge amount of praise and good reviews this film gets. Almost every respectable horror fan and website, as well as film critics qualify this one as a topnotch horror film. Honestly, I don't see why. The movie is very boring, and the only thing that keeps you awake is the remarkably good and vivid score of Bernard Hermann. The shower scene is undeniably well-made....for that era...but it looks pretty ridiculous for todays' standards if you ask me. I mean, volumes have been written about the masterful editing and handling of this particular scene, and I truly was not impressed by it. <br />Perhaps I need to watch Psycho again on a better print, or watch it on a good home theater on DVD, but my first experience with it was incredibly dissapointing.
B000021Y74|5.0|filled with fast paced camera work blended together with the racing of Franka Potente's movement. exciting and bloody great. a must see for anyone. one of the best movies of 1999
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|HEY EVERYONE. NEED HELP ON COMPILING LIST OF SONGS FEATURED IN MOVIE BUT NOT INCLUDED ON THE SOUNDTRACK, NOTABLY A ROCK AND ROLL OLDIE USED DURING A MONTAGE SCENE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE FILM, REALLY CATCHY POP OLDIE! PLEASE HELP!   (it might be a christmas rock pop song.... someone mentioned that! just please name some names.... someone post a review with a list of tracks featured in the film but not on the soundtrack!<BR>thanks
B00000JLWW|3.0|First off I liked the movie.  I do not like the DVD.  When you consider how huge this movie was it is shameful that the only extras anyone could come up with is only one of the 7 or 8 trailers/TV Spots and some trivia in text format.  <br />Think about that for a minute.  How many interviews, TV Specials and featurettes did you see when this thing came out?  Where are they?  No idea.  All I know is they aren't on this disc; so if you're looking for extra footage or bloopers or even a &quot;Making Of&quot; short, do not buy this DVD.  <br />On the positive side, unlike the VHS, at least it is condensed to one disk without hurting the video or sound appreciably.<br />Undoubtedly there will be a  2-3 disc Special Edition or Directors Cut at the 10th anniversary.  You've waited this long, hold out till 2007.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Well again Arnold makes us love and hate robots. Great action and special effects, and even good acting make this well worth buying. I only wish the advanced robot he is up against was a little more animated. For an improved model that was used to fool humans she didn't seem as believable as Arnold. Not enough dialog for her.<br /><br />The story line is good, we see John as an adult hiding from life and travelling around to prevent any records of his existence. Even though they destroyed Skynet, he is not sure it could be prevented. His training from his mother Sarah and his own instincts pay off. Some incredible chase sequences will keep you glued to your seat.<br /><br />The two disc set is loaded with extras. The sound and picture quality is incredible. None better. You will almost feel like you are in the movie. On a Big Screen High Definition TV it is like being at the theater. I highly recommend this Widescreen Edition. Any fan of Terminator movies or Schwarzenegger will love it as a gift.
B000053V7Q|5.0|There is no question that this is Presley at his best ever. He is 35 years old and has never looked or sounded better. the sad thing with this version is that some of the songs have been edited out. I just can't help believing, I've lost you and Bridge over troubled water live on stage versions. As the other's he does an excellent job woth these also. wish they had left them in. hopefully we can get another version or another dvd with all the other footage there must be.
B000002GVO|5.0|HOTEL CALIFORNIA is the best album the Eagles ever did. Here, the music seems as much inspired by the Allman Brothers Band's BROTHERS AND SISTERS as by California rock. The songs provide cautions that we can all learn from, ranging from avoidance of the latest trends to staying sober to protecting the environment. Several songs on this album have inspired me to put pictures of pretty actresses on my wall and in my wallet as a deterrent to self-indulgent behavior, most obviously \\"Life In The Fast Lane.\\" Moreover, the band's members currently advocate sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, making this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000002TYX|5.0|Material from an intense period of development, including the covers from the hundreds of hours on stage in Hamburg that forged them into professionals. A glimpse into the begginings of the greatest band there ever was or ever will be!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I admit I am a recent Grobanite and am enchanted with Josh Groban's music.  CLOSER reaches deeper, higher, further into my heart than any male classical-pop vocal album.  It is classically constructed, arranged and performed, beginning with OCEANO, a gorgeous high impact Italian opening and then moves adventurously through each song-compositions with intelligence, beauty and grace.<br />I can only say how fortunate I am to be living at this time in history to experience such great and grand music.  In CLOSER, Josh sings in 4 languages, Italian, English, Spanish and French.  He is the first singer I have ever experienced to make Enlgish sound like A ROMANCE LANGUAGE.  To be a humble master at such a young age, and with one of the most beautiful and memorable voices, is a great blessing. Josh Groban blesses us with a repertoire of masterful songs with some elegant high points such as YOU RAISE ME UP, PAR TE, REMEMBER WHEN IT RAINS, and more that is unforgettably inspiring and galvanizing to my spirit. Every song is perfection.  Out of this world beautiful.<br />It takes several hearings (like all great music) to infuse the songs within the heart.  Each one reveals mastery and such great beauty.  The orchestrations are A+++ and provide a sonic atmosphere for Josh's God-given voice to take off and sing to the heavens.  This is mastery, the Italian songs bring tears, in fact the whole album brings one to tears.  It is one of the finest collections of songs I have ever heard.  Congratulations to all who made this album and especially to Josh Groban.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is the very eagerly anticipated sophmore effort from Mr. Josh Groban (not including the live CD from the much celebrated PBS special). With over 5 million units sold worldwide, there's no sophmore jinx lurking here.  Josh delivers the goods we've come to expect; Power ballads that hit the heart & soul with such force that Amazon should've listed CLOSER with a \\"better together\\" offer that included a box of tissues.  Josh has added to and enhanced the formula by co-writing 3 tunes. Yes his musical team has the best talent money can buy but the power & emotion of this young man's voice demands it. Groanites & newbie fans alike will be delighted in CLOSER.  Buy the limited edition w/ the DVD now. You get some extra tunes on the CD & face it, if not now, you'll end up ordering it later anyway.

B000022TSH|5.0|Perhaps the best film noir screenplay ever written.  Performances are flawless, direction is impeccable and the casting is without parallel.  &quot;Chinatown&quot; leaves one awed.
B000002LQR|4.0|a perpetually funky, ultra groovy tripped out escapade that recalibrates the brain delightfully, if ya let it.<br />White men can funk.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Loved the movie, the problem was that after watching almost all the way thru, we (my sister and I) had trouble seeing the ending. After the battle at almost the end, the movie suddenly reverts back toward the beginning. This makes the second dvd (of the same movie) that has done this.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I'll try to keep this short, because I could go on and on about this movie if I didn't watch out. But I LOVED it after my first viewing, and after the second, I decided it was DEFINITELY ON PAR WITH THE FIRST MATRIX, AND PROBABLY EVEN BETTER. And this, despite the lack of the stunning revelations that the first had. The first Matrix had shocking revelations, for sure, but the second two have slowly unfolding ideas that add depth to the original and give reason to love, discuss and debate this trilogy for years to come. Plus all that great action and graphics!<br />I was disappointed (a lot) with Reloaded, but tried to reserve judgement until seeing Revolutions. It isn't fair to judge a movie by only its first half, after all. Everyone seemed to think it had either too much action or too much talk. I thought it had way too much of each. Not really too much talk, but the way they did it made it seem like too much. And there was so much action that seemed gratuitous and purposeless. But I watched Reloaded a few more times and it grew on me as I saw how it might fit in to the trilogy and realized how it expanded on the philosophy. And I like it even more after seeing Revolutions!<br />As for Revolutions, IT BLEW MY MIND RIGHT FROM THE START. Everything is in perfect balance and it is a perfect crowning end (maybe) to the trilogy. Everything necessary is explained, but it still leaves room for another sequel... such as the possibility of  Neo coming back from wherever he is (at the Source?), explaining exactly what the Source is and its relationship to the Machine World, etc. How could the Architect be \\"God\\" (as some say) when his presence wasn't necessary (maybe he didn't exist) until the machines needed a matrix to control human beings? How could both humans and machines predate God, if they did? Ditto for the Merovingian. And, could he possibly be the first \\"One\\", gone bad? What is the Oracle's relation to the Architect, in the grand scheme of things? How will the relations between free man, machine, program, and man-in-pod develop? Is peace possible? Will the sky be cleared? This movie brought a very satisfactory ending to the trilogy, while still leaving plenty more for a sequel. PLEASE, WACHOWSKI BROTHERS, GIVE US ANOTHER MATRIX MOVIE!!!<br />FOR SOME OF YOU CRITICS who think there is too much talk or not enough answers in Revolutions, try watching all of the Matrix movies again. There is hardly a word of wasted dialogue, which only becomes clear if you pay attention the whole way through. And almost everything you could have a question about is likewise answered by careful attention to the dialogue. A little research, LEARNING from other sources, and THINKING about how philosophy applies to OUR OWN little existences doesn't hurt either. <br />FOR THOSE WHO SAY REVOLUTION LACKED BULLET TIME, watch the scene when Neo punches Smith in the jaw in the rain. The rain droplets in Revolutions are the equivalent of bullet time in Matrix and  I have to say I was WAY more impressed with the effect of \\"RAINDROP TIME\\" than bullet time. I can't wait for the DVD so I can hit the \\"instant replay\\" button over and over again!<br />And for those who have been merciless in their criticism of the new Oracle.... I can sort of see where you're coming from. I missed the old Oracle at first too. But by the end of the second time I saw Revolutions, I decided I liked her way better than the first (with my apologies and respect to the deceased) and wouldn't want to have any Oracle but her again.<br />I thought Keanu's acting was great, including the \\"cry scene\\" so many seem to complain about. You're the One, Neo! Just right for this part, if not for every other part on the planet. As for Morpheus acting so subdued... how do you expect someone to act who's realized that EVERYTHING he's worked and fought for ALL HIS LIFE (finding the One) has been a big lie? Of course he's going to be super bummed out, \\"a bit\\" depressed, and more than a little leary of putting his opinions or beliefs forth again. Fishburne portrayed Morpheus the only way he could be portrayed in Revolutions.<br />The airborne fight between Neo and Smith was a bit campy, to be sure, but I ADORED it! And as for Smith, there are too few words to describe the delight in watching his \\"program\\" display of half, if not the whole, gammut of \\"human\\" emotions.<br />I could find some things to nit-pick about, but they're so easy to overlook in the context of the movie and the trilogy as a whole. Who of us can do better? Perfection is not of this earth and people who try to destroy the majesty of a \\"mountain\\" by frantically pointing out the \\"molehills\\" at its base to anyone they can get to listen only make themselves look like petty ignoramuses who have never had the sense or the sensibility to lift their eyes to the moutain peaks. I'm sure some people just might not like philosophical movies or this one in particular, but those critics on some sites who give Revolutions all \\"F's\\" (including for visuals!) are clearly *****s who don't have the brains, the decency or the honesty to separate one aspect of the movie from the other.<br />I better quit now. I'm going to see this one again and again, and buy the DVD when it comes out. And of course, I'll be first in line if ever there is another Matrix movie. DON'T LET THE CRITICS STOP YOU FROM SEEING AND EXPERIENCING A PERFECTLY SPECTACULAR MOVIE!!!!
